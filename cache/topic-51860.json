Margaux has been playing hangman games on paper and online.  It&#39;s a great game for learning how to spell words and for sight recognition of words.  I didn&#39;t get her involved in hangman games for the purpose of learning more words and how to spell them.  I helped her do what she wanted to do, which was to play barbies, Nancy Drew games, and watch mystery shows on Netflix.  One of the Nancy Drew games had a built in hangman game that you had to play to get something.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first time we played that game, about 6 mos ago, she wasn&#39;t at all interested in the hangman game and I did that part for her.  She wanted to play the game again because it&#39;s a fashion mystery game and she&#39;s been playing fashion games with barbies and dress up games online and adding twists of mystery here and there.  This time around, she was very interested in the hangman game and played it over and over, then moved on to paper, then we found some games online which she then played for many many hours.  This has lasted for more than a week now. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I&#39;d never fostered her love of barbies and fashion and Nancy Drew, she may never have found hangman games and played them for fun.  While the games were up online, everyone that passed by got involved, including Chamille and her boyfriend and my husband.  It was lighthearted and fun.  If I&#39;d started out with hangman games, I doubt very much Margaux would&#39;ve jumped into it like she did.  The last 2 days have been filled with Sims, she&#39;s taken a break from hangman games to do some more fashion/role playing stuff.  At some point today, she&#39;ll probably get bored and we&#39;ll play tic tac toe because she got a little tic tac toe game from the dentist.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] what learning looks like, was All That Jazz (or, Hi, I&#39;m new!) :)","postDate":"1268508103","msgId":52006,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY0OTAxNS43MDk0NC5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDEubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEM3NDhEMURBLTVDQjAtNDYyMS05MUQzLTMxNEY5MjgxQTM3M0BzdXBlbm4uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDU2MDhBMzNBQTBFNjRGRDc4MkJFOUZEMTVBMEY5NDJGQExpdHRsZVZhaW8+IDxFREVDNEQzOS0wRDdDLTRDM0EtOENGQy01QzFDODNFOUVFMDZAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDw0Qjk2QjFCQS44MDkwNjA1QHR3Y255LnJyLmNvbT4gPDAxN2MwMWNhYmZjZiQxMmY5MTY1MCQwMzAyYThjMEBsaXNhc3I3MXZueWt5dT4gPDMyNEM1NUI3LTEyRTktNEJBOS04Rjk1LTVFMjE2NDEyMjcxRkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4gPDc5YzFkMWI0MTAwMzExMjA1M280YTUxYzllN3IyZDJjMTZjZmMxMzMwNTA1QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8Qzc0OEQxREEtNUNCMC00NjIxLTkxRDMtMzE0RjkyODFBMzczQHN1cGVubi5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":51994,"nextInTopic":52009,"prevInTime":52005,"nextInTime":52007,"topicId":51860,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Most of his process was invisible to us; we actually suspected for awhile that he could read better than we knew because he seemed to want that to be","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1992067194\">***Most of his process was invisible to us; we actually suspected for awhile that he could read better than we knew because he seemed to want that to be private--he is a very private person.***<br/>\n<br/>\nChamille is VERY much this way!  Sometimes she surprises me with little conversations that enlighten me about how much she knows.  If we never had those conversations, it would look like she wasn&#39;t learning anything.  It&#39;s a very internal process for her.  None of the stuff she learns, to her, seem like anything huge.  It&#39;s all information that she&#39;s gathered for personal reasons or through absorption.  To her, she&#39;s just being her.  When she talks to me, I&#39;ll get little glimpses and to me, it&#39;s really cool and exciting information.<br/>\n<br/>\nMargaux is loud and talks a lot.  You can&#39;t help but see and know what she knows because it&#39;s a visible process.  When she plays with numbers, she does it aloud, asks questions and comes up with answers.  I only knew that Chamille could figure things out mathematically through little things every once in a while, like when we are at the store and comparing prices for whether or not it&#39;s cheaper to get the large container or the smaller one that&#39;s on sale.  She won&#39;t say much, she&#39;ll just grab the cheaper one and let me know that it&#39;s less money for the amount.  If I wasn&#39;t paying attention, I&#39;d miss lots of her learning.  I don&#39;t know her process like I do Margaux&#39;s, I never have, and I doubt I ever will.

Learning can look like watching TV. Learning can look like  <br/>\n&gt; swimming.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe the  most useful definition of what learning looks like is  <br/>\n&gt; engagement. If a child is engaged, he&#39;s learning.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But engagement isn&#39;t unschooling. Unschooling is a parent  <br/>\n&gt; *facilitating* a child&#39;s engagement.

I see that playing out in my kids&#39; lives too, right now. Sometimes when they spend 2-3 hours on a project, or playing Legos, or playing dress-up, I find myself thinking, &quot;If they were in school, how often would they have the time to do what they want to do until they&#39;re really done with it?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSu, mom to Eric 8; Carl, almost 6; Yehva, 2.5<br/>\ntapeflags.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] All That Jazz (or, Hi, I&#39;m new!) :)","postDate":"1268423322","msgId":51982,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEIzNjA4MzQ2LTE2NTMtNDg2OC05QjM0LTREOERFNjJEQzQ1NUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDc5YzFkMWI0MTAwMzExMjA1M280YTUxYzllN3IyZDJjMTZjZmMxMzMwNTA1QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDU2MDhBMzNBQTBFNjRGRDc4MkJFOUZEMTVBMEY5NDJGQExpdHRsZVZhaW8+IDxFREVDNEQzOS0wRDdDLTRDM0EtOENGQy01QzFDODNFOUVFMDZAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDw0Qjk2QjFCQS44MDkwNjA1QHR3Y255LnJyLmNvbT4gPDAxN2MwMWNhYmZjZiQxMmY5MTY1MCQwMzAyYThjMEBsaXNhc3I3MXZueWt5dT4gPDMyNEM1NUI3LTEyRTktNEJBOS04Rjk1LTVFMjE2NDEyMjcxRkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4gPDc5YzFkMWI0MTAwMzExMjA1M280YTUxYzllN3IyZDJjMTZjZmMxMzMwNTA1QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":51978,"nextInTopic":51984,"prevInTime":51981,"nextInTime":51983,"topicId":51860,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I had thought a child doing whatever it desires is learning?

I&#39;ve<br/>\ntold them they have to do housework.  Fair enough if they have homework, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t mind if they don&#39;t do chores, but if there&#39;s no homework, I&#39;m not<br/>\nhaving them sitting around doing nothing!&quot;.  I just nodded and quietly<br/>\nthought to myself &#39;why?  why, after a busy week at school, can they not just<br/>\nsit around &#39;doing nothing&#39; - more than likely they won&#39;t be &#39;doing nothing&#39;<br/>\nanyway, they&#39;ll be thinking, imagining, planning, dreaming, creating.  Or<br/>\ndoing that most dastardly of things - playing on video games or watching tv!<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Outside Badgers waiting for our children to come out (organised group<br/>\nthing for St John Ambulance - similarish to Scouts), mother saying &quot;He (9yo)<br/>\nis difficult to motivate to come along here now, and he doesn&#39;t want to go<br/>\nto scouts either.  We go straight to Friday Club (?) after this, and he has<br/>\nkick boxing on Wednesdays.  I&#39;ve told him he has to just get on and do these<br/>\ngroups whether he likes it or not.  He has to learn commitment and I&#39;m not<br/>\nhaving him sitting around doing nothing after school!&quot;  Today she was<br/>\ntelling another mum about her daughter&#39;s two dance classes every saturday as<br/>\nwell as allt he other clubs during the week :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nI just despair as to when these children ever get time just to &#39;be&#39;.<br/>\nThey&#39;ll have more than enough time to be run ragged with all their<br/>\nresponsibilities as adults, but at least they&#39;ll have a choice whether or<br/>\nnot to take those on as adults.  Now they have to spend 6 hours a day, at<br/>\nleast, in school - more if they go to a &#39;breakfast&#39; and/or &#39;afterschool&#39;<br/>\nclub.  Then, when they&#39;re home, they have to do homework or if they don&#39;t<br/>\nhave homework, then housework.  And then there are all the out of school<br/>\nclubs they have to go to in the evenings and weekends.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love that my children spend so much time &#39;doing nothing&#39; - they&#39;re so<br/>\nfree!

He doesn&#39;t like being lectured to, doesn&#39;t like people telling him what to do, finds almost anything that looks like a &quot;worksheet&quot; very off-putting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis past six months he made dramatic progress in three areas I had hoped he&#39;d progress in (unschooling fail there, I know): reading, facility with numbers, and perservering through frustration (this last one is really hard for him). He mostly did it through playing a huge, open-ended video game called Morrowind, where you have a character who interacts with other characters, you buy and sell things, how you interact with people makes a difference in how they&#39;ll treat you later. You can set goals that then require fulfilling a whole set of prior requirements: doing somebody a favor so they&#39;ll like you enough to sell you a thing you can then trade with this other person for something a third person wants...<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of his process was invisible to us; we actually suspected for awhile that he could read better than we knew because he seemed to want that to be private--he is a very private person. I&#39;m still not sure just how well he can read, but the fact that he can play this very text-heavy game on his own, successfully, without needing to ask my reading help anymore suggests &quot;pretty well.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son Carl, who will be six next week, doesn&#39;t mind people telling him what to do, mostly. He listens attentively, quickly grasps what you&#39;re saying, and likes worksheets. He&#39;s also made progress in reading and numeracy this year, mostly through reading Bob books (very simple phonics-based readers) with me, and doing math &quot;paperwork.&quot; He likes the Math-U-See curriculum I bought during a period of weakness and doubt awhile ago. He will do a math worksheet and hang it proudly on the wall right beside a picture he drew, or then take it to his &quot;special shelf&quot; where his most precious things live.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarl has also learned from video games and other things, but the fact that he does do and enjoy what looks like &quot;homework&quot; makes it easy to see his process, it&#39;s a familiar process so it&#39;s easy to trust, it&#39;s easy for other people to see and understand and validate. Honestly (another unschooling fail coming here) it&#39;s been a little bit of a relief to have a kid on that path--I fret a lot less about Carl and how he&#39;s doing than I do about Eric, though I fret less and less about Eric as he gets older. (I&#39;m fretful. It&#39;s one of my weaknesses as an unschooling mom. It&#39;s why I came back to this list after some time away.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, there&#39;s a challenge with Carl, too, to be careful not to give him the message that the more conventionally academic stuff he likes to do is more important or valuable than the other stuff he does.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m digressing. When I saw the thing about some kids pulling in certain things and others not, I thought of Carl and Eric. It would be easy to think, &quot;Hey, unschooling is really working for Carl--he does math worksheets for fun!&quot; As it has been for me, it might be more challenging for a mom with a kid like Eric.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu, mom to Eric 8; Carl, almost 6; Yehva, 2.5<br/>\ntapeflags.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] All That Jazz (or, Hi, I&#39;m new!) :)","postDate":"1268393828","msgId":51963,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI1RUJFNzc2LTEwNjktNDlBRS04NEUxLUE4RjRGODg4QUQwNEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDc5YzFkMWI0MTAwMzExMjA1M280YTUxYzllN3IyZDJjMTZjZmMxMzMwNTA1QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDU2MDhBMzNBQTBFNjRGRDc4MkJFOUZEMTVBMEY5NDJGQExpdHRsZVZhaW8+IDxFREVDNEQzOS0wRDdDLTRDM0EtOENGQy01QzFDODNFOUVFMDZAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDw0Qjk2QjFCQS44MDkwNjA1QHR3Y255LnJyLmNvbT4gPDAxN2MwMWNhYmZjZiQxMmY5MTY1MCQwMzAyYThjMEBsaXNhc3I3MXZueWt5dT4gPDMyNEM1NUI3LTEyRTktNEJBOS04Rjk1LTVFMjE2NDEyMjcxRkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4gPDc5YzFkMWI0MTAwMzExMjA1M280YTUxYzllN3IyZDJjMTZjZmMxMzMwNTA1QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":51962,"nextInTopic":51967,"prevInTime":51962,"nextInTime":51964,"topicId":51860,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Unlike  <br/>\nschool, <br/>\nwe don&#39;t memorize an expert&#39;s (the teachers, a textbook  <br/>\nauthor&#39;s) <br/>\nexplanation of how something works.

The good learners, the school approved learners, are the ones who pull the information in and can regurgitate that information on to a test, in a question format, hand raised with confidence. The bad learners, the ones who won&#39;t attain &quot;all one needs to know&quot; can&#39;t hear the words, can&#39;t figure out which words are important, can&#39;t pull the information out because of other things being more interesting, more engaging than a lecture or a text or an educational film.  The point is that unschooling will work for the child who isn&#39;t pulling in the expert&#39;s explanation of how something works. Just as it will for the child who can pull the information out. Unschooling is about recognizing that the learner is<br/>\n the point of learning and not the expert&#39;s explanation and not the curriculum. And however that learning happens, kinetically, visually, experientially, through text, however it happens, unschooling is about making those moments easy to get to, and not some kind of pass fail approach to achievement and learning. Being able to explore the world and derive information from it is innate. Getting turned off of some kinds of information, feeling like you are too stupid to be able to get anything from a book or a documentary, that&#39;s more likely to be learned than innate. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Vidyut Kale &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wide.aware@...\">wide.aware@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Friday, 12 March, 2010 4:53:23<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] All That Jazz (or, Hi, I&#39;m new!) :)<br/>\n<br/>\n**Some kids will pull stuff in.

I have a head full of bits  <br/>\nand pieces that don&#39;t fit into too many boxes other than the one  <br/>\nlabeled &quot;Interesting stuff&quot; ;-) The collection is good for playing  <br/>\nJeopardy and Trivial Pursuit!<br/>\n<br/>\n(School probably &quot;works&quot; best and easiest for those with a big need  <br/>\nto fill an &quot;Interesting stuff&quot; box. Stuff just gets sucked in without  <br/>\nmuch effort. That drive gets labeled smart but it&#39;s a personality  <br/>\nquirk. (And by &quot;work&quot; I mean, kids can spit stuff back for tests.  <br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t necessarily translate to the knowledge working in real  <br/>\nlife.))<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce people get past the learning paradigm of a teacher putting  <br/>\ninformation into a kid&#39;s head (or making the kid pull it in), the  <br/>\nimage they grasp of what unschooling looks like is a child pulling  <br/>\ninformation in all on their own. (Ironically Pam just posted that was  <br/>\nher first question as a newbie.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids will pull stuff in. That&#39;s their personality. And their new- <br/>\nto-unschooling moms think unschooling is working :-) But for most  <br/>\nkids learning looks like playing. And if the parent expects  <br/>\nunschooling to look like kids pulling in information, the parent  <br/>\nthinks unschooling isn&#39;t working. But what&#39;s not working is the  <br/>\nparent&#39;s understanding of how people learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nReal learning is trying things out to see what happens. It&#39;s -- often  <br/>\nas a side effect, or an unconscious working toward -- building an  <br/>\nunderstanding of how things work by working with them. It&#39;s making  <br/>\nconnections between one thing and another. The experimenting,  <br/>\nrefining and connecting happens on an &quot;as needed&quot; -- to the learner!  <br/>\n-- basis. What drives the processes is whatever the learner wants  <br/>\nfrom the experience. The goal may be deep or surface or seem to  <br/>\noutsiders as if it had nothing to do with what&#39;s &quot;supposed&quot; to be  <br/>\nlearned from the experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people grasp that way of learning. It&#39;s what most people use for  <br/>\ncasual interests. What is hard to grasp is how that chaotic random  <br/>\nprocess that lacks the goal of getting &quot;all someone needs to know&quot;  <br/>\ncould possibly work to get &quot;all someone needs to know&quot; into them. How  <br/>\ncould it get a body of knowledge about math and science and history?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat paradigm, that the goal is &quot;all one needs to know&quot;, is one of  <br/>\nthe big roadblocks to getting unschooling. To get unschooling, people  <br/>\nneed to redefine &quot;all one needs to know&quot;. They have the school  <br/>\ndefinition. In school &quot;all one needs to know&quot; is a generic collection  <br/>\nof information and skills from which people will pick and choose what  <br/>\nthey need to form a foundation for further learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nLogically the school definition sounds like a great idea. It&#39;s  <br/>\nhanding kids the materials and tools to do whatever they want as  <br/>\nadults. One problem with that idea is kids aren&#39;t just handed all  <br/>\nthat stuff. They&#39;re made to work for 12+ years to cram it into their  <br/>\nheads. Another problem is that cramming in information is counter to  <br/>\nhow people naturally learn. We don&#39;t learn naturally by memorizing  <br/>\nother people&#39;s pre-assembled understanding of the world. We are  <br/>\nhardwired to assemble our own understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt *seems* incredibly inefficient to build our own understanding from  <br/>\nscratch! And *if* someone&#39;s goal is to draw in a particular set of  <br/>\nknowledge it definitely is inefficient. But, again, humans aren&#39;t  <br/>\ndesigned to suck in a set of information and then use it. We&#39;re  <br/>\ndesigned to pull in and figure out what we need as we need it and  <br/>\nrefine our understanding as we go along.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s profound about natural learning is that the understanding we  <br/>\nbuild for ourselves easily becomes generalized because we&#39;re already  <br/>\npulling the understanding from lots of different contexts. Unlike  <br/>\nschool, we don&#39;t memorize an expert&#39;s (the teachers, a textbook  <br/>\nauthor&#39;s) explanation of how something works. We build our own  <br/>\nunderstanding from working with something for personally meaningful  <br/>\nreasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone can redefine &quot;all one needs to know&quot; to the ability to  <br/>\nexplore and figure out how to get something to work for them *and*  <br/>\nthen trust that that is enough, they can get past that big initial  <br/>\nhump between them and &quot;getting&quot; unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":415223200,"authorName":"BlueOcean","from":"&quot;BlueOcean&quot; &lt;blueocean@...&gt;","profile":"littaladybug","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] All That Jazz (or, Hi, I&#39;m new!) :)","postDate":"1268185201","msgId":51863,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyZGIwMWNhYmZmMiQ5YTVjZTMxMCQwMzAyYThjMEBsaXNhc3I3MXZueWt5dT4=","referencesHeader":"PDU2MDhBMzNBQTBFNjRGRDc4MkJFOUZEMTVBMEY5NDJGQExpdHRsZVZhaW8+IDxFREVDNEQzOS0wRDdDLTRDM0EtOENGQy01QzFDODNFOUVFMDZAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDw0Qjk2QjFCQS44MDkwNjA1QHR3Y255LnJyLmNvbT4gPDAxN2MwMWNhYmZjZiQxMmY5MTY1MCQwMzAyYThjMEBsaXNhc3I3MXZueWt5dT4gPDA5MTkwRUE1LTA5M0EtNEY4MS1BMTg2LTUxOUZDNEI4MjYxNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":51862,"nextInTopic":51940,"prevInTime":51862,"nextInTime":51864,"topicId":51860,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"By Please be patient with me , I meant please don t crucify me for transgressing occasionally if I say something that doesn t jive with unschooling . ;) And","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2012442712\">By &quot;Please be patient with me&quot;, I meant &quot;please don&#39;t crucify me for <br/>\ntransgressing occasionally if I say something that doesn&#39;t jive with <br/>\nunschooling&quot;. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;m not unaccustomed to ducking.
