At first I didn&#39;t want to miss something important<br/>\nand it was about anxiety. I grew less worried and still didn&#39;t want to<br/>\nmiss anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nHad I been younger I probably would have taken my mom&#39;s offer of help<br/>\nafter the birth, but I didn&#39;t care if the house got messier. I was<br/>\nbusy recuperating and getting to know Karl. Over the phone the advice<br/>\nwas to not let him monopolize my time. Something about getting back to<br/>\nnormal? By that time I had had years of ignoring parental advice with<br/>\nlittle or no ill effects.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn finding ways to say yes, like Roya is finding. That&#39;s an<br/>\ninteresting read. Now that Karl&#39;s 7, it helps to say some of that to<br/>\nhim, that if I can&#39;t say yes to what he asks I can see how to say yes<br/>\nto what he&#39;s asking. For instance, doing a particular activity might<br/>\nnot be possible right that moment but saying to him that we can find a<br/>\nway to do something similar if the big part of his reasoning is about<br/>\nsomething else.

What I wrote was not about babies, it was<br/>\n&gt; about ladies-in-waiting and other attendants in a tableau situation, a<br/>\n&gt; kind of theatrical make-believe situation where I&#39;ve been a coach and<br/>\n&gt; director.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am at my family&#39;s beck and call, because I like them.

Flight attendants are at the beck and call of<br/>\n&gt; pilots first and then passengers.  Retail store clerks are at the beck<br/>\n&gt; and call of customers unless assigned to stay behind the cash register<br/>\n&gt; (convenience store clerks are not going to leave the liquor and<br/>\n&gt; gambling cards to go 20 feet to help you find the cheese crackers).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That phrase needs be added here:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/phrases\">http://sandradodd.com/phrases</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; P.S.<br/>\n&gt; For anyone who&#39;s into language, or curious about what my hobby was<br/>\n&gt; before it was writing about unschooling, some &quot;beck and call&quot; notes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Ranking people shouldn&#39;t have to say much to get someone to come<br/>\n&gt; closer.

If<br/>\n&gt; someone said &quot;quickly&quot; it meant &quot;lively,&quot; which can also be used in<br/>\n&gt; terms of speed, as in &quot;step lively.&quot; Fast meant stuck, constant, or<br/>\n&gt; fixed.

Poor little babies.  For some reason I&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen through a week of being around parents being quite mean to small <br/>\nchildren. I&#39;m looking forward to hanging out with a whole bunch of <br/>\nunschoolers on Wednesday and being soothed by their sweetness to their <br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoya and I had an interesting conversation yesterday. She&#39;s working at a <br/>\nsummer daycare program - a really really good one run by a person who <br/>\nhas the &quot;old-fashioned&quot; idea that children should be free to play and <br/>\nhave fun and she tries to make daycare as free and in the control of the <br/>\nkids, themselves, as possible. Anyway, Roya plays with the kids there, <br/>\nor facilitates their play, and she was saying how surprisingly easy it <br/>\nis, even for her, to say &quot;no&quot; to kids&#39; requests, when she could find <br/>\nways to say yes. Lots of the kids are very needy in the sense that they <br/>\nvery very obviously are not getting enough attention from parents. They <br/>\nwill cling to her and hug her and tell her they love her. And lots of <br/>\nthem are obviously very restricted and controlled at home (and at <br/>\nschool) and some have really awful parents, and lots of them have a <br/>\nhabit of trying to find the limits or boundaries and pushing them. She <br/>\nhas a group of kids to keep an eye on - her job is to keep them safe <br/>\nwhile pretty much doing every thing she possibly can to support their <br/>\ninterests and meet their needs. Keep in mind, this is a 25 yo who has <br/>\nbeen unschooled and not had arbitrary limits or controls in her own <br/>\nlife. And STILL she said she hears, &quot;No,&quot; come out of her mouth far too <br/>\nfrequently. She backs up, she said, over and over throughout the day and <br/>\nsays, &quot;Well, maybe, let&#39;s see if we can do that somehow.&quot; She says the <br/>\n&quot;no&quot; comes from feeling pressured  - that the neediness and <br/>\ndemandingness and the pushiness of some of the kids gets wearing and the <br/>\n&quot;no&quot; is more to say, &quot;No more,&quot; than really &quot;no&quot; to that particular <br/>\nrequest.  I told her I thought that was sometimes the same kind of <br/>\nreason for parents. She said she was getting really good practice in <br/>\nfinding ways to say yes more. So we talked about some of the problems <br/>\npeople have had with that concept &quot;say yes more&quot; and how it made some <br/>\npeople think they have to say yes ALL the time to absolutely everything. <br/>\nRoya said she was getting really good at thinking about what would <br/>\n&quot;serve the purpose&quot; of what a kid was asking. I liked that way of <br/>\nthinking about how we respond, as parents, to requests....figure out <br/>\nwhat will &quot;serve the purpose&quot; for the child.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - what surprised her was how easy it was to slip into &quot;no&quot; as a <br/>\ndefault when being with a group of kids and how it took conscious effort <br/>\non her part not to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] new phrases; old phrases","postDate":"1280159054","msgId":56373,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY0NTNGQTI0LTQ3N0EtNDYzNS05OUU4LUREMjQ4QkNFRDRCM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBQzYxQkYyLTQ3QTYtNDQ3MC1BNzFFLURDRjM4NkU2NDYyNkBTYW5kcmFEb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEJBQzYxQkYyLTQ3QTYtNDQ3MC1BNzFFLURDRjM4NkU2NDYyNkBTYW5kcmFEb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":56371,"nextInTopic":56374,"prevInTime":56372,"nextInTime":56374,"topicId":56371,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"flesh and blood.

It&#39;s not longer to say, it&#39;s still three syllables.  But  <br/>\ngiving it a secret-jargon term makes it seem more distant, more a  <br/>\ngeneral practice than a decision, more scientific, less about *crying.*<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that&#39;s too new, too &quot;modern,&quot; too much attempt to turn flesh-and- <br/>\nblook crying baby into something chrome and glass, or at least  <br/>\norganically treated crib-wood.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that was tied in with the phrase &quot;at...beck and call.&quot;  Because of  <br/>\nmy many years of medieval-studies hobby and my long interest in  <br/>\nlanguage, I know a lot about &quot;beck and call.&quot;  I&#39;ve thought about it  <br/>\nand written about it.   What I wrote was not about babies, it was  <br/>\nabout ladies-in-waiting and other attendants in a tableau situation, a  <br/>\nkind of theatrical make-believe situation where I&#39;ve been a coach and  <br/>\ndirector.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am at my family&#39;s beck and call, because I like them.  If I have  <br/>\nhouse guests, I am at their beck and call.  Nurses are at the beck and  <br/>\ncall of patients.  Flight attendants are at the beck and call of  <br/>\npilots first and then passengers.  Retail store clerks are at the beck  <br/>\nand call of customers unless assigned to stay behind the cash register  <br/>\n(convenience store clerks are not going to leave the liquor and  <br/>\ngambling cards to go 20 feet to help you find the cheese crackers).<br/>\n<br/>\nThat phrase needs be added here:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/phrases\">http://sandradodd.com/phrases</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.<br/>\nFor anyone who&#39;s into language, or curious about what my hobby was  <br/>\nbefore it was writing about unschooling, some &quot;beck and call&quot; notes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Ranking people shouldn&#39;t have to say much to get someone to come  <br/>\ncloser. The concept of being at someone&#39;s &quot;beck and call&quot; means close  <br/>\nenough that a gesture (beck) or call will get them there in a jiffy  <br/>\n(or, more likely, in the nonce, meaning &quot;in an instance&quot;) They can&#39;t  <br/>\ncome quick, because &quot;quick&quot; meant &quot;alive&quot; in period, not fast  <br/>\n(besides, even now teachers will tell you to use &quot;quickly.&quot;). If  <br/>\nsomeone said &quot;quickly&quot; it meant &quot;lively,&quot; which can also be used in  <br/>\nterms of speed, as in &quot;step lively.&quot; Fast meant stuck, constant, or  <br/>\nfixed. Supper was &quot;fixed&quot; when it was put on the table. (In the  <br/>\nsouthern U.S. people still &quot;fix supper&quot; even though it&#39;s not broken.)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote that.
