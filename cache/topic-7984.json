I teach<br/>\ntechnical Theatre classes and am fortunate that the subject allows me to<br/>\nhave other ways of assessment. Unfortunately I do have to grade the students<br/>\nto  satisfy administrators and record keepers.<br/>\nAt the start of the term, this is very unsettling to about 90% of the<br/>\nstudents. I ask (multiple times) what they want to learn from the class. I<br/>\nsee lots of confused faces. I also see people staring blankly hoping I will<br/>\njust get to the (nonexistent) list of requirements they need to pass the<br/>\nclass. I can&#39;t help but think that for most of these people it is the first<br/>\ntime they have been asked to guide their own learning.<br/>\nBy the third of fourth week most of class gets it. Or at least on some level<br/>\nthey understand that this is not going to be like there other classes.  They<br/>\nstop asking for the specific requirements of the class. They can ask<br/>\nquestions about the subject without worrying about reciting our discussion<br/>\nlater for the exam. When I ask at the end of class each day if they are<br/>\ngetting what they wanted out of the class they slowly realize that they can<br/>\nsay &quot;no,&quot; and ask if we can go over or find out about such and such. And we<br/>\ndo. An I don&#39;t hold hard to any subject line. If after discussing lighting<br/>\ncontrol boards, the class wants to go over how they compare to sound<br/>\nconsoles, we explore sound.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany, understandably have to ask how they are doing grade wise in the class,<br/>\nso (after letting them know that if it was up to me there would be no<br/>\ngrades) I ask leading questions about their participation in the class and<br/>\nget them to self evaluate with my last question being &quot;so what what kind of<br/>\ngrade do you think that is?&quot; they eventually tell me.
