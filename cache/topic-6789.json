There are  different &quot;varieties&quot; of<br/>\nMethodist, too. For example, Mt. Zion Methodist is WAY<br/>\ndifferent. It is non-liturgical. When I visited there,<br/>\nI was the only &quot;White&quot;. When the pastor said &quot;Make a<br/>\njoyful noise&quot;, they did (dancing, clapping).  The<br/>\nPastor was selected by his personal calling. The<br/>\npastor has to have separate income, in order to eat.<br/>\nEach of that type is unique to itself and<br/>\ncongregation. St. Paul&#39;s has a beaurocratic hierarchy<br/>\nwhose pastors were (are?) selected by means of<br/>\napplications and interviews and refererrals after (or<br/>\nanticipation of) graduation from either seminary or<br/>\ncollege with relevant majors and additional training<br/>\nin their field. Preaching is a career with good<br/>\nhousing, reasonable compensation and status.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a Black volunteer (Family Outreach<br/>\nprogram....child abuse prevention) who was a priest<br/>\nwith the Episcopalian Church (on the FAMU campus). <br/>\nOne day he commented that after 20 years of active<br/>\ncivil rights efforts (this was about 1988 or so) that<br/>\ndiscrimination was still entrenched in his chosen<br/>\nchurch.  He showed me that there were some Black<br/>\npriests, particularly in Africa, a few whatever comes<br/>\nnext, and so on until there were NO Blacks at all<br/>\nabove a well established ceiling. I&#39;m afraid I wasn&#39;t<br/>\ntoo sympathetic.  My comment was &quot;What did you expect,<br/>\nThe Church of England, White Man&#39;s burden and all<br/>\nthat?&quot; Now I am stepping on MORE toes!! The<br/>\nEpiscopalian (that I&#39;ve met recently,in this area) are<br/>\nsome of the more open-minded folks!!

It just seems wrong to<br/>\nme that ANY religion, or spiritual teaching, should<br/>\nhave EVER had as part of its teachings that some<br/>\npeople&#39;s genetic qualities are to be treated badly and<br/>\nothers rewarded. I also sometimes feel guilty for not<br/>\nfighting the fight, anymore. There are lots of social<br/>\ninequities and wrongs, in lots of areas. I think I<br/>\ndon&#39;t have the stamina I used to.<br/>\n:-(  I miss that endless energy. I am grateful that I<br/>\nhad access to it (energy...opportunities....)
