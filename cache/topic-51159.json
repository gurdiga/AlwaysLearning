They were so thankful that they were able to draw on our house, something that I didn&#39;t think was a big deal at all.  They can still draw on the house now that it&#39;s painted and it just hoses right off.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat same day one of the kids asked if they could paint.  I said &quot;sure&quot; and brought out all of our painting supplies and our big roll of butcher paper.  They had fun for a good couple hours experimenting with all sorts of different painting styles.  A lot of the paint ended up on our deck, and some of it is still there two years later.  It makes me smile when I see it knowing how much fun these kids had and most of all because they would never have been allowed to do something like that at their own houses.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJulie van der Wekken<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lerendzonderschool.blogspot.com/\">http://www.lerendzonderschool.blogspot.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":222835102,"authorName":"lalow66","from":"&quot;lalow66&quot; &lt;lalow@...&gt;","profile":"lalow66","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: use of this group","postDate":"1267209366","msgId":51175,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhtOTRhbSs2dWJhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMTAwMjI2MTAxMnk0MjA5OTNjMHI1MTc0ZDA4M2JlZTNmYjVjQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":51172,"nextInTopic":51177,"prevInTime":51174,"nextInTime":51176,"topicId":51159,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It isn&#39;t the usual discussion about unschooling, but it is<br/>\npart of people&#39;s unschooling lives. Asking about manga on a conventional<br/>\nparenting list might not get nearly the kind of helpful information as here<br/>\n- it might get criticism. A bit of discussion about specific activities can<br/>\nbe interesting, too, as examples of what people are doing in their own<br/>\nreal-life families as unschoolers. I wonder how many conventional families<br/>\nwould paint a whole wall with magnetic paint and the parents would spend<br/>\ntime thinking of interesting things that would work on that wall. Some, for<br/>\nsure. But lots would think it was a bit overboard.  I know a lot of parents,<br/>\nfor example, who wouldn&#39;t let their kids use sidewalk chalk on their patios<br/>\nor on the sidewalk in front of their houses because it &quot;looks tacky.&quot; I LOVE<br/>\nwalking by someone&#39;s house and seeing children&#39;s drawings all over the<br/>\nsidewalk - I always picture that the kids are being allowed to have fun<br/>\nINSIDE the house, too. I never knew there was magnetic paint. I know someone<br/>\nwho bought a new refrigerator and it was NOT magnetic - it changed the<br/>\nnature of their lives not to have a refrigerator to hang stuff on.  Every<br/>\ntime I was in their kitchen I noticed it and it felt a little sad because<br/>\nbefore they had that refrigerator, their old one had always been fun and<br/>\ninteresting to me. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers homes are very likely going to be someone unconventional. That&#39;s<br/>\nwhat I&#39;ve noticed. Usually unschooling means more clutter, but not always.<br/>\nALWAYS it means more children&#39;s stuff being out and visible. I really don&#39;t<br/>\nthink unschooling is viable in a &quot;designed&quot; home, if you know what I mean,<br/>\nwhere there are decorator touches and things are arranged just so. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI wish we&#39;d had a magnetic wall. I really think that would have been so fun.<br/>\nI might still do that when I have grandkids. I wasn&#39;t even, at first,<br/>\npicturing a wall to play on (although that sounds awesome) - I was just<br/>\npicturing an entire big wall with lots of magnets to hang pictures and<br/>\npostcards and notes and stuff like that. Magnetic letters and numbers and<br/>\ncool fridge magnets. The refrigerator has never been big enough! <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nManga? I&#39;m clueless - know nothing about it. But, it interested me a lot<br/>\nthat so many parents were able to step right in with so much information.<br/>\nTHAT shows what supporting a kids&#39; interests looks like. Unschooling parents<br/>\ndon&#39;t need to know anything about manga UNLESS that&#39;s something their kids<br/>\nare more and more into and then they need to be willing to learn a LOT in<br/>\norder to expand on that interest, to build on it, to feed it and nurture it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThese are just two particular things - magnetic walls and manga - but the<br/>\nresponses about those were great examples of how unschooling works in<br/>\npractice. I figured that there are people on this list who appreciated<br/>\nseeing the responses even if they weren&#39;t interested in magnetic walls or<br/>\nmanga. The magnetic wall stuff was really about strewing - thinking about<br/>\nsomething that might be interesting to the kids. The manga stuff was about<br/>\nhow to accommodate a kid&#39;s interest, how to support it, especially when it<br/>\nwas interfering with family life in some way.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] use of this group","postDate":"1267162438","msgId":51161,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJDOTdDNTUxLTIxOEUtNEY3Mi05Q0FDLTRENzNENTFEMDc1REBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhtNmc0ZitrazhoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhtNmc0ZitrazhoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":51159,"nextInTopic":51168,"prevInTime":51160,"nextInTime":51162,"topicId":51159,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I know what you mean, Caren, but I think it gives people a chance to talk about what their kids love.
