Now, my 6 year has <br/>\nshown me an appreciation for computer games (we don&#39;t have any others as <br/>\nyet) that I&#39;m really surprised I  have. I am hooked on one particular game - <br/>\nmore hooked than Lewi! It&#39;s fun and there&#39;s so much stuff to solve. They are <br/>\nbaffling and frustrating, and at the moment I&#39;m on level 98 (of a 100 level <br/>\ngame) and sometimes I feel like I&#39;ll never make it to the end...but I keep <br/>\non keeping on.

He  <br/>\nsaid &quot;I think you&#39;re better at this than I am now.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell...  no.  Because I play it like reading music, and there were  <br/>\nsome guitar things I know from playing guitar, like hammering on and  <br/>\npulling off.  So as long as it can relate to piano-read-by-notes or  <br/>\nto finger picking, I&#39;m not bad.  But when it gets to the rock&#39;n&#39;roll  <br/>\nsolos where the notation isn&#39;t precise and you have to be wild and  <br/>\nbrave, I get scared because I don&#39;t &quot;know it.&quot;  I couldn&#39;t analyze  <br/>\nit, and I can&#39;t put it into words or analogies.  But those passages  <br/>\nare no harder for Kirby than the rest of it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Marty accidentally erased all our saved games; no problem,  <br/>\neveryone was friendly and fine about it.   But I was stuck on the  <br/>\nadvanced level and I just want to get to the songs I know better and  <br/>\nlike, so I asked Kirby to help me, and he went right through those  <br/>\ntwo songs I couldn&#39;t get.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he was five he could do the first part of the original Mario  <br/>\nGame, but when Mario goes down the tube to the koopas, he got  <br/>\nscared.  He just didn&#39;t like the look of them.  So he would  yell for  <br/>\nme, and coach me through it, and when Mario was past those, he took  <br/>\nit back and played lots of other parts.  Lava and swinging blades  <br/>\nwere fine with him, he just didn&#39;t like koopas. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s another area of partnership rather than diversity.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s another thing  That game belongs to Kirby, but Marty owns the  <br/>\nPlaystation, so it lives in Marty&#39;s room. He has never asked anyone  <br/>\nto get out or not to play it.  And last Saturday all the kids were  <br/>\nout and about.  Holly had gone with Marty to the ice rink to meet  <br/>\nsome others, and then they were going out to eat.  Nobody was here  <br/>\nbut me and Keith.   Full moon.  Hot tub.  I came in wet (swim suit  <br/>\nand wet) to turn off the porch light and there are four people in the  <br/>\ndenâ€”Holly, Marty and two of Kirby&#39;s friends.  Holly was showing the  <br/>\ngirl her Rent &quot;action figures&quot; and showing her some of the subtle  <br/>\ndetails.  Marty was winding up video game cords.  I&#39;m glad I had come  <br/>\nin because he said &quot;We&#39;re taking the X Box, in case you noticed it  <br/>\nwas gone.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOh!  Kirby had called a few hours before and said &quot;I&#39;m going to  <br/>\ndinner with those guys.&quot;  I thought he meant his burly big gaming  <br/>\nbuddies.  Later I called to talk to Holly and she said Kirby was at  <br/>\nthe restaurant with them.   So it turns out that yet another group of  <br/>\nfriends has folded into their activities.  Kirby&#39;s &quot;those guys&quot;  <br/>\nincluded Marty and Holly, and their skate party which used to only  <br/>\ninvolve the teen unschoolers now had included some of Kirby&#39;s current  <br/>\nfriends.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to get to the point of this pile of stories:    I was up when  <br/>\nKirby finally came in Sunday morning to go to bed at 6:00.  He said  <br/>\n&quot;Where&#39;s the XBox?&quot; (because it usually lives on his desk) and I said  <br/>\n&quot;They took it to Sadie&#39;s.&quot;  &quot;Oh, okay.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of that was said in the most matter-of-fact tone of voice.  Kirby  <br/>\nbought the X-Box, but he didn&#39;t say &quot;Where&#39;s MY XBox,&quot; and he didn&#39;t  <br/>\nmutter or ask who took it or why or when it would be back.<br/>\n<br/>\nGenerosity.

While some may believe that games will &quot;rot your brain,&quot; I&#39;m living<br/>\nproof to the contrary. I&#39;m now 23, and I still play games. However, in<br/>\nthe mean time, I have graduated high school with honors and a National<br/>\nHonors Society member. I&#39;ve earned a Bachelor of Science degree in<br/>\ncomputer science and engineering, cum laude. I&#39;m currently enrolled in<br/>\nlaw school, and doing quite well. I personally attribute a lot of my<br/>\nacademic success to video games, and always have. One important lesson<br/>\nI&#39;ve learned is how to budget my time effectively. Video games also<br/>\nserve as an important release from the stress created by such rigorous<br/>\nstudy. Also, I believe each and every game teaches important educational<br/>\nconcepts indirectly (e.g. reading comprehension, logic and mathematics<br/>\nthrough puzzle solving, hand-eye coordination, etc.)  I&#39;m very<br/>\nsupportive of parents who get gaming systems for their kids, and I hate<br/>\nit when I hear how games are &quot;destroying&quot; our youth.  I hope many<br/>\nparents read your page and make use of it!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\nBrian</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26113,"nextTopicId":26117}}
