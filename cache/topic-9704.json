Basically each week a family hosted and another<br/>\nmom would stay. That left 2 moms to go to coffee, shop, take care of bills, or<br/>\nhang out. We all had second kids so we had 4 4-5 year olds and 4  2 year olds.<br/>\nWe sang a song or more, did a craft, played and then had lunch for the kids<br/>\nand moms. Seeing the kids sit down and eat and socialize was beautiful.<br/>\n<br/>\n These moms and kids are still our favored friends. Even though 2 families<br/>\nhave moved out of town. This summer 3 of us all got together for a week of<br/>\ncondo camping and fishing. We had 9 kids between us and the kids truely have<br/>\ndeep lasting friendship with each other. I think the co-op lasted for 1 1/2<br/>\nyears and stopped when 1 kid then went to kindergarden and the rest of us got<br/>\nmore involved in our local homeschool support group. It was very easy to host<br/>\ntoo. Cobstruction paper, glue, paint, playdough, cookies. I think we all used<br/>\nAlternatives to Preschool for ideas, which is an LLL book.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary H.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9694,"nextTopicId":9710}}
