Then it stretched into a year. And then<br/>\nit was until he went to preschool. Well, because of this and that<br/>\n(late potty training and, in retrospect, the fact that neither he nor<br/>\nI were really into preschool/schooling - although we didn&#39;t exactly<br/>\nknow it at the time), he never went to preschool. Then I heard about<br/>\nhomeschooling and immediately knew this was what we wanted to try. But<br/>\neven to this day (he&#39;s now 11), we still say that we&#39;re going to<br/>\nhomeschool &quot;as long as it seems to be working out.&quot; The question now<br/>\nseems to be whether or not he&#39;s going to high school.

She still doesn&#39;t know what she is<br/>\ntalking about.<br/>\n===========<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly&#39;s godmother is a friend who hung out with me nearly every day in the <br/>\nyears when Kirby and Marty were born.  And when Holly was a baby, Kirby didn&#39;t <br/>\ngo to kindergarten, but that wasn&#39;t a big deal.  She knew that if Kirby wanted <br/>\nto, or if things didn&#39;t go well, he could go to kindergarten the next year, or <br/>\nto 1st grade. So the first year &quot;didn&#39;t count.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend was a pre-school teacher for the deaf.  Her whole identity was <br/>\nbeing a teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she found out we really LIKED unschooling and when she found out Kirby <br/>\nwas staying home for a second year, she said Something strangely hateful.  She <br/>\nsaid &quot;You&#39;re homeschooling for YOUR benefit, not for Kirby&#39;s.  You&#39;re being <br/>\nselfish.&quot; (might not be exact words, but 95% right, if I&#39;ve forgotten a little; <br/>\n&quot;selfish&quot; and  the idea that it was for me and not Kirby were in there).<br/>\n<br/>\nI had an infant and a three year old that season.  It&#39;s not like staying with <br/>\nKirby was keeping me from being in medical school, y&#39;know, or climbing Mt. <br/>\nEverest.  I was going to be home anyway.  So I honestly had no idea what she was <br/>\ntalking about.  It seemed she was grasping for mean-straws.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe only very occasionally have hung out since then.  She couldn&#39;t support <br/>\nwhat we were doing.   And I didn&#39;t really need the judgmental snarkiness of <br/>\nsomeone who honestly had NO reason to look at what we were doing without <br/>\nteacher-glasses on.  So I was occasionally a little bit sad, and usually not at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe retired from teaching this year.  Maybe when her investment fades she&#39;ll <br/>\nbe back around.  That might be nice for Holly, but no notable thing for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf our children are our priotiries, its easier for us to let others fall <br/>\naway.  Anyone who tried to get me to do so much as nod and agree with her/him at <br/>\nthe expense of my beliefs or of my children was just outathere.  I stood my <br/>\nground.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there are ways to soften the situation.  I never set an absolute on it.  <br/>\nI would say &quot;If it turns out it&#39;s not working, he can go to school,&quot; or &quot;We&#39;ll <br/>\njust do it as long as it seems to be the best thing.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19863,"nextTopicId":19868}}
