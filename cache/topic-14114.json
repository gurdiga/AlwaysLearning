He has had the worst teeth.  Two absested and <br/>\n  were removed after antibiotics within a 6 month period when he was 3. <br/>\n  He had to be knocked out the second time around, then he spent 2 <br/>\n  years refusing to open his mouth for a dentist and grew two more <br/>\n  nasty cavities.

They are baby teeth <br/>\n  that are going to fall out anyway.  <br/>\n  This is the discussion i have to have tomorrow and this guy is <br/>\n  intimidating.  <br/>\n  They already made a mold for the spacer at the last appointment which <br/>\n  wasn&#39;t suppose to happen til this appointment tomorrow.  I get a bill <br/>\n  for over $400 for this mold, and I didn&#39;t even agree to have the <br/>\n  spacer put in!  He had lined up 3 appointment for me with all the <br/>\n  costs and proceedures layed out and told me there would be no <br/>\n  suprises with cost.  I had expressed my concern with the expense when <br/>\n  we started all this.<br/>\n  The spacer wasn&#39;t suppose to happen til the 3rd appt. and I was still <br/>\n  debating about doing it or not.  I hadn&#39;t told him that, but I <br/>\n  thought I had time.  Now I have a bill for something I think I don&#39;t <br/>\n  want to happen.  I&#39;m not paying if we don&#39;t do it.

He has had the worst teeth.  Two absested and <br/>\nwere removed after antibiotics within a 6 month period when he was 3. <br/>\nHe had to be knocked out the second time around, then he spent 2 <br/>\nyears refusing to open his mouth for a dentist and grew two more <br/>\nnasty cavities.
