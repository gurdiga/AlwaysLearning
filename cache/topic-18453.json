I just finished it and found it very <br/>\nthought provoking. The writer mentions Holt and Neill as some of his <br/>\ninspiration so I was hopeing it is okey that I ask. I had a rather <br/>\nhard day myself, icy here and we lost electricity 3 times, but the <br/>\nworse is that I think my ds is coming down sick because he treated <br/>\nme terribly all day today, perhaps I have the winter blues as well.. <br/>\nI&#39;m on a new book now &quot;Making it up as we go along - the Albany Free <br/>\nschool story&quot; seems interesting but even in NY it appears that they <br/>\nwere getting state $ for meals and several volunteer teachers and <br/>\nother resources that I&#39;m sure that here in Missouri we are not going <br/>\nto get. It&#39;s important to me that everyone be able to have a good <br/>\nquality education not just those who can afford to homeschool or <br/>\nafford private school tuition, I saw a &quot;free school&quot; starting in AZ <br/>\nthat looked nice and was planning on going on &quot;donations&quot; alone, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know how they expect to keep that up as well, the property <br/>\ntaxes alone are terrible! Let alone things like food and books!!!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18451,"nextTopicId":18454}}
