I was on the Webgrrls list for years, for <br/>\nwomen web designers, and on that list there was so much traffic it <br/>\nwas difficult for most of us to keep up. So, when people asked <br/>\nquestions, they would request e-mail answers &quot;off list&quot; and afterward <br/>\ncreate a summary. That way, it was much easier to *keep up* with list <br/>\ntraffic AND, best of all, to *file* topics for reference. Here&#39;s how, <br/>\nif anyone wants to try it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI write to the list saying my 12 year old boy, who has been offered <br/>\nhis freedom :), becomes worried about the loss of social scene. I <br/>\ncollect the answers (mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gw@...\">gw@...</a>) from all you <br/>\ngreat people, and compile the following and send it in with the <br/>\noriginal question and a Subject heading: SUMMARY: Social Scene)<br/>\n___________________<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;His friends from school will hang with him even when he&#39;s out of<br/>\nschool---just afternoons and weekends. If they aren&#39;t his friends, they<br/>\nwon&#39;t. He could also make a few homeschooled friends through local groups.<br/>\nYou could come to the conference where he&#39;ll meet a few teens that could lead<br/>\nto long-term long-distance friends. Not Back to School Camp could also be an<br/>\noption.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly,<br/>\nThanks. I do hope we can find some home school groups. We live in <br/>\nNorthern VA -- Manassas to be exact. I will be hanging on the lists <br/>\nthrough the summer lurking to find groups. Also, what is &quot;Not Back to <br/>\nSchool Camp&quot;. Are these offered only in SC?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Does he like sports?  My son has found plenty of friends through his sports<br/>\nteams.  If not, what *does* he like?  Can you sign him up for classes or<br/>\nworkshops in something that interests him?<br/>\nTia&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat would be perfect. He is in a *break dancing class* right now, <br/>\nrunning Sep-June. Not too many kids there, though. He is interested <br/>\nin drum lessons (another post on BAND issues coming up.) His main <br/>\ninterest is video games.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I am now teaching in a middle school.  There are lots of ways you can<br/>\nhave your son hook up with kids his age.  Sports, summer classes,<br/>\nchurch groups, homeschooling groups with teens in it (we have a great<br/>\none) etc.  But please, don&#39;t think the social scene that happens at a<br/>\nmiddle school positive for middle school students.  It simply isn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy experience as a teacher again confirms why I will never send my<br/>\nchildren to school.<br/>\n<br/>\njoylyn&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere is this &quot;great teen group &quot; located??

In the woods, not in <br/>\na neighborhood with lots of kids.
