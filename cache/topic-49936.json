It&#39;s as though people are looking for an excuse as to why their child has sooo much energy, instead of realizing that it is perfectly normal for children to be &quot;in motion&quot; for a good part of their existence.  Having lots of energy is seen as a negative trait in children nowadays it seems.  &quot;Calm down&quot; is a frequent phrase I hear from parents when out in public or at relative&#39;s houses.  I would think that a child that is in school would have even more (pent up) energy than those that are not in school, and thus need more opportunities in which to be free to run and play outdoors or at a bounce house or skating rink, ect...<br/>\n<br/>\nA good friend of mine (who is also an unschooler), had an experience last summer with a neighbor boy who had come over to play.  The mom walked the boy over and when the neighbor boy and my friends boy saw each other, they sort of went &quot;wild&quot; with excitement to play with each other (perfectly normal in my friends eyes).  They were both whooping and hollering and genuinely excited to be able to play together.  Well, when the mother noticed her son getting excited, she said &quot;oh, I forgot, he hasn&#39;t had his pill&quot;, and my friend said &quot;what?&quot; and the lady said &quot;I need to take him home so he can have his pill&quot;.  My friend &quot;said, &quot;it&#39;s o.k., he&#39;s fine, they just want to play&quot;, but the mother insisted and when he returned, he was noticeably calmer:(  <br/>\n<br/>\nTwo of my nephews have noticeably higher energy than the rest of the nephews which IMO can easily be directed by going and doing something physical outside.  One cousin is on ritalin, and the other was &quot;diagnosed&quot; by his pediatrician to be &quot;borderline ADHD&quot;.  The one that isn&#39;t on ritalin gets a lot of &quot;calm down&#39;s&quot; and/or time out&#39;s because of his high energy levels:(  Interesting to note that neither of my nephews parents having any paranoia  concerning sugar making their kids hyper.  Maybe because they have the ADD/ADHD excuse?<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie van der Wekken<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lerendzonderschool.blogspot.com/\">http://lerendzonderschool.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joanna&quot; &lt;ridingmom@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yesterday we picked a friend up from a 4-H project.

Perhaps many of you<br/>\nare already aware, but I thought I would share my sister&#39;s research: High<br/>\nLevels of Mercury in corn syrup. Now retired, and teaching spec ed kids in<br/>\nHawaii, she worked at/for the FDA researching the effects of Mercury<br/>\npoisoning in our children, specifically &quot;whistle blowing&quot; that the FDA<br/>\nignored her findings quiet. Her findings have since been published in<br/>\nEnvironmental Health and can be read online and have been echoed and further<br/>\nexplored by other scientists in the field. She is now working on a<br/>\npublication, book, which continues her efforts to educate the public and<br/>\ndraw pressure on the industrialist machine. Have I stopped buying all<br/>\nproducts containing high fructose corn syrup? No..but knowing what I know<br/>\nnow, I read the labels, and I sure as heck limit the amounts Eli ingests<br/>\nsimply by choosing other products that are free of HFCS.

I&#39;ve given up telling folks that sugar doesn&#39;t make kids hyper, they simply don&#39;t believe it.  The link below will take you to a sweet little article that sums up the research done on this topic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/5uene7\">http://tinyurl.com/5uene7</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMost interesting to me was the study where they told the moms they were testing for the effects of sugar on behavior, but they were really testing the moms&#39; reactions.  It&#39;s in the article linked above, but here&#39;s the gist:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;why would a sizable chunk of the child-rearing population continue to swear it (the sugar/hyperactivity link) exists? For a crucial piece of the puzzle we turn to the Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology and a 1994 study by Daniel Hoover and Richard Milich, in which they looked at 31 boys ages five to seven and their mothers, all of whom had described their offspring as being &quot;behaviorally affected by sugar.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mom-son teams were split into the customary two groups: the moms in one were told their sons would be given extra-sugary Kool-Aid, while the others were told their kids were in the control group and would get a drink sweetened with aspartame. In reality, though, the same artificially sweetened stuff was administered to both sets of kids while the women got a sheaf of surveys to fill out. Mothers and children were then videotaped playing together, after which the moms were asked how they thought things went.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat did Hoover and Milich find? You guessed it: the moms who thought they were in the sugar group said their sons acted more hyper. In addition, they tended to hover over their children more during play, offer more criticism of their behavior, etc. The mother-son pairs in the other group were judged by observers to be getting along better. What&#39;s more, those moms who, going into the experiment, most strongly believed their kids were sugar-sensitive also scored highest on a test designed to gauge cognitive rigidity.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom there, of course, it&#39;s not too hard to whip up a hypothesis explaining why the sugar-high myth persists. Having always heard that sugar makes kids act crazy, some parents, particularly those hailing from the control-freak end of the spectrum, may go a little crazy themselves when the sugary stuff enters the picture. In situations where sweets are freely available to their children - like birthday parties or other high-stimulation events - they watch worriedly for any sign of obstreperousness, see it even if it&#39;s not there, call it hyperactivity, and attribute it to the cookies and cake. Kids, meanwhile, typically aren&#39;t oblivious to this sort of anxiety; consciously or not, they may well figure out that after taking on a load of candy they&#39;re expected to run amok and happily oblige.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJennie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Corn Syrup Reaction","postDate":"1264389766","msgId":49988,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVGQjIwNDVCLUNDRDAtNEUzNi1BQ0Q1LTM3RDYxNzc0NkM1OEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDY2Mzg1OC4xNjI1NS5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MTYubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhqaTZ1Mys0aW82QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NjYzODU4LjE2MjU1LnFtQHdlYjExMDQxNi5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":49987,"nextInTopic":50132,"prevInTime":49987,"nextInTime":49989,"topicId":49936,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I m positive that some people like to insult others by some vague notion of feeling judged and not being able to talk about that directly.-=- I m not","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1801214182\">-=-I&#39;m positive that some people like to insult others by some vague  <br/>\nnotion of feeling judged and not being able to talk about that  <br/>\ndirectly.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not allergic to being vaguely and indirectly insulted.

We eat sugar in many forms and have no reactions to it.  Two of my children have corn syrup without any reactions.  My son, however, does seem to have a reaction to it.

It is simply how my body reacts to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Did you tell him about that high and describe it to him yourself?&quot;   <br/>\n<br/>\nNo, I did not.

He has used this interpretation and so perhaps my efforts to help him understand that different foods may make his body feel differently, has given him an impression of &quot;bad&quot;.  This is completely my fault and I need to see how I am talking to him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Perhaps if you drop the whole thing completely and entirely and let  him have what he wants, after a while there will be nothing to act and react about on either side.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps this is true and I certainly hope that it is.  I guess my real question is one that should be reserved for a later date should it become necessary:  &quot;what if he has all he wants and has continual ups and downs which affect not only him, but everyone around him?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot; Maybe the talking is contributing to the anger.  I bet you were  <br/>\n commenting on his behavior before he got angry each time.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, I have never commented on his behavior until he got angry and started acting aggressively.  I do not mind him having alot of energy and laughing hysterically.  I do not like it when he starts hitting his siblings or yelling at people around him.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot; I think you should not &quot;buy a bunch&quot; of anything.

My son loves high fructose corn syrup because it give him a &quot;high&quot; feeling where he runs around laughing hysterically and having alot of energy.  However, after this reaction subsides, he becomes very angry and sad and acts out aggressively.  I&#39;ve tried talking to him about this, but he sees me as trying to take away his &quot;high&quot; feeling that he likes by suggesting that maybe the corn syrup is bad for him.  I don&#39;t want to tell him he cannot have the corn syrup.  I want him to be free to make his own choices.   I have no problems allowing him to have sugar as much as he wants and so I buy products with sugar instead of corn syrup.  He says that he wants the corn syrup ones because he wants the &quot;high&quot; feeling.  He doesn&#39;t connect the angry feelings with the &quot;high&quot; feelings and talking hasn&#39;t helped.  Should I just buy a bunch of corn syrup products and let him have at it, hoping that someday he&#39;ll make the connection?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nBev</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50165,"nextTopicId":50201}}
