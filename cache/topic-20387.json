HSLDA defined it for us, <br/>\nand &quot;endorsed&quot; this spelling as the one they will use within the <br/>\norganization. Spelling it this way is to signify that you are a <br/>\nparent that is doing school at home for religious related reasons <br/>\n(preserving a religion, separatism from the secular world, or <br/>\nseparatism from school policy or curriculum choices).  <br/>\n<br/>\nMany HSLDA members, people they lobby to, and the general public <br/>\nthey encountered, were using different terms to describe learning at <br/>\nhome.  So HSLDA chose to go with &quot;homeschool&quot; universally.  There <br/>\nare implications, mostly hypothetical now, but remember, in a less <br/>\nfree society, the group closest to the power will have the say in <br/>\nthe term, and thus who might be eligible to be under <br/>\nthe &quot;homeschooling&quot; umbrella. <br/>\n<br/>\nHOME SCHOOL or HOME-SCHOOL (notice it&#39;s all not one word):<br/>\nBear with my scattered thoughts here...HOME SCHOOL with a space is <br/>\ngramatically correct.  A hyphen would not be technically, but if <br/>\nsomeone here or there in the home ed world could define home school <br/>\nwith a hyphen and make it a popularized term.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do I care?  Since HSLDA definded homeschool, I guess the rest of <br/>\nthe non-ps&#39;ers  thar are not in school for reasons other than <br/>\nreligious do not fit into that term.  For now, the spelling is a <br/>\nseemingly small technicality and spelling it all different ways goes <br/>\non because it hasn&#39;t caught on in many groups or the media.  I&#39;ve <br/>\nwasted a fair amount of needless time (?) on a lot of what if, <br/>\nfuturistic, hypothetical questions that ponder where would we be, as <br/>\nhome-schoolers if the term homeschooling was somehow made the only <br/>\nway to define school or learning away from brick and mortar (or <br/>\ncyberschool) school.  Onto...<br/>\n<br/>\nSUB-CATEGORIES:<br/>\nThe terms eclectic schooling, classical schooling, cyberschooling, <br/>\nCM, WTM, Ambelside, Waldorf, and so on, AND, unschooling could be <br/>\nconsidered sub categories of both homeschooling and home schooling.  <br/>\nTrue unschooling would be rare for the homeschooler, but it could <br/>\nhappen.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBACK TO UNSCHOOLING:<br/>\nI think it&#39;s high time that there be three categories:  <br/>\nhomeschooling, home-schooling, and unschooling.  Since homeschooling <br/>\nhas been defined for us by HSLDA, it&#39;s up to others to define the <br/>\ndifferences between home school and unschool in the public/political <br/>\nforum.

What made total sense to me <br/>\nwas that true unschoolers really &quot;get&quot; the following terms (I&#39;m <br/>\ngoing to quote the poster here):  <br/>\n<br/>\nautonomous living, <br/>\nnon-coercive parenting, <br/>\nmutually agreed upon solutions, and <br/>\nconsensual living*<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with poster GoldStandard, that you need to walk the walk <br/>\nwith an unschooler, home schooler or what ever, to talk the talk   <br/>\nUntil that time (somewhere psychologically around the 5- to 7- <br/>\nmental schema shift is the point I think previous posters were <br/>\ntrying to convey the mental &quot;switch&quot; outward to learning), parents <br/>\nwith younger children may benefit more from boards dealing with the <br/>\nabove as well as attachment parenting rather than primarily here?  <br/>\n<br/>\n~Diane<br/>\n<br/>\n*Oh, and thank you, thank you, thank you for these terms!

I tend to think that when DD turns 5 or 6 (not sure what <br/>\nthe law is, just moved here, I&#39;ll have to look it up) WE won&#39;t notice <br/>\nwhen the first day of school rolls around either. How would we even know <br/>\nunless we actively went seeking that info? Why would we care?<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone said here recently that unschooling is a subset of <br/>\nhomeschooling, that without school, there would be no homeschooling. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t look at it that way at all. That we need to focus on the existence <br/>\nof school to emphasize the choice to homeschool, and that unschooling is <br/>\na type of homeschooling . . . I don&#39;t know, it doesn&#39;t feel right. It <br/>\nfeels too . . . inextricably connected to the school system. Like if I <br/>\nam wearing a black shirt, I don&#39;t refer to it as a &quot;not white&quot; shirt. <br/>\nIt&#39;s apparent and need not be emphasized. If there were no such thing as <br/>\nschool there would be ONLY homeschooling. So I don&#39;t get that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel absolutely no pull to define myself in terms of &quot;not school&quot; or <br/>\neven &quot;X type of homeschooler.&quot; I wish there was a term for unschooling <br/>\nthat didn&#39;t even contain the word school. Some call it child-led <br/>\nlearning, or delight-driven learning. Those seem to me to be a more <br/>\naccurate description of what unschooling is.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course that is totally subjective, I&#39;m not suggesting that anyone <br/>\nshould stop calling themselves unschoolers if that&#39;s what they prefer. <br/>\nBut the more I am told that what I am doing is attachment parenting and <br/>\nnot unschooling, the more disenchanted I become with the term <br/>\nunschooling. Attachment parenting has to do with being responsive, yes, <br/>\nbut it&#39;s not about removing limits the way unschooling is. There are WAY <br/>\nmore limits in most AP households than in mine. And even more limits in <br/>\nnon AP households. I am consciously implementing the unschooling <br/>\nphilosophy now, so that there is no difficult transition later.  That is <br/>\nnot the same as practicing AP.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhenever I raise a concern about the future for my family in the context <br/>\nof unschooling, I am often told by those who have been through it, &quot;Just <br/>\nlive life and it&#39;ll work out.&quot; So that&#39;s more how I&#39;ve started thinking <br/>\nabout unschooling. Not as a type of homeschooler or as the anti-school <br/>\nbut just as a liver of life.

We joined a newly formed<br/>\nlocal support group when Jayn was 18 months old, three years ago, and I had<br/>\nalready been on the HSC list. I was reading John Holt, but had not really<br/>\nhad the courage or understanding to commit to unschooling until Pam<br/>\nSorooshian let me know about this list [UnschoolingDiscussion] - but I don&#39;t<br/>\nremember exactly when that was.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to call myself an Unschooler, and have done for a while, as I am<br/>\nsurrounded by people who are most emphatically not unschoolers in my hs<br/>\ngroup. I finally had to &quot;come out&quot; at my group although I knew a long time<br/>\nbefore doing so. Most of them are relaxed/eclectic, but still use curriculum<br/>\nmaterials, some are charter, and most have &quot;educational goals&quot; for their<br/>\nchildren. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is definitely an aura that they feel slightly superior and view my<br/>\nunschooling being not so much dangerous neglect, but a crackpot experiment<br/>\nthat will undoubtedly fade away once Jayn gets older and starts to need more<br/>\nteaching. I have no fear of this occurring myself! <br/>\n<br/>\nMost are rigidly controlling of food, tv, computers and how their time is to<br/>\nbe spent. They are also wonderfully gentle, non-spanking parents who allow<br/>\ntheir children the opportunity to develop their own games and relationships<br/>\nat the park without the constant mediation and bossiness that characterizes<br/>\nthe &quot;ordinary&quot; parents we see at parks. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo many of these hs&#39;ers I know are &quot;following a program&quot; even for their<br/>\nlittle children, recommending the &quot;early reading&quot; and &quot;reading readiness&quot;<br/>\nmaterials. They look for resources for &quot;early immersion Spanish&quot; or take<br/>\nclasses, seek out teachable moments, or insist that their children must do a<br/>\ncertain amount of various subjects before playing. I hear the conversations<br/>\nalthough I don&#39;t usually participate in them. The parents strive to make it<br/>\n&quot;more interesting&quot; and sometimes even use (gasp!) videos as part of some<br/>\nunit studies. These are 3 and 4 and 5 year olds. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey talk about how they did &quot;The Food Pyramid&quot; (as if there were only one)<br/>\nso that they could explain why their parental food controls were right. They<br/>\ngenuinely delight in how much fun the kids had cutting out little pictures<br/>\nof fruit etc and sticking them on some chart they downloaded. (Jayn has not<br/>\nshown the slightest interest in this type of activity so far - she likes to<br/>\ncut out paper dolls, snowflakes or geometric shapes for use in collages.) <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is plenty of talk about how much enjoyment their child gets from the<br/>\nwhatever Unit they are doing, and how &quot;We have to stop or she&#39;d want to<br/>\nlearn ALL the State capitols in ONE DAY!&quot; I always say, &quot;So, why stop?&quot; The<br/>\nanswers are always either along the lines of some other commitment coming up<br/>\nin the next half hour, or parental exhaustion. There is always a sense of<br/>\nenvy (not from me!) for those parents whose children love to do workbooks<br/>\nfrom the &quot;unlucky&quot; ones whose children resist the things.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the children go, when the homeschoolers are all playing together<br/>\nat the park, it is impossible to tell which ones use Abeka or Sonlight or<br/>\nwhatever (names I have heard but know nothing about) from the Unit studiers<br/>\nor Jayn. It is only when they start to interact with their own parents that<br/>\ndifferences in parenting become discernible. There are quite a few parents<br/>\nwho are ready to jump in with &quot;Did you say Thank you for that cracker?&quot;.<br/>\nThere are sometimes: &quot;Can we go to Sophia&#39;s tomorrow?&quot; &quot;We have to finish<br/>\nour school work first&quot;; and the occasional inexplicable &quot;May I take off my<br/>\nsweater?&quot; &quot;No&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is those moments that remind me with a jolt that I am an Unschooler with<br/>\na whole different mind set.

There is a  Mom with <br/>\na 3 YO son.  He goes to a Montessori preschool three times a week  and she <br/>\ncalls herself an unschooler.  She has said that she believes this  is an <br/>\nenriching environment where he can learn and get some social  interaction.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy thinking was that he is not even old enough in NC to be homeschooled so  <br/>\nhow can she begin to say he is unschooled.<br/>\n <br/>\nSecond:  He is in SCHOOL!!!!   The other moms said &quot;well she  needed a break <br/>\nfrom him so to her it is like a baby-sitter or Mom&#39;s Morning  Out.<br/>\n <br/>\nThird: Her thought process is still that of &quot;this place is the place he  will <br/>\nlearn.&quot;  Not that &quot;leaning happens everywhere.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nI do believe that he will just continue on in the Montessori program.   I <br/>\nhave been thinking about this a lot the past few days.  And I can&#39;t wrap  my <br/>\nbrain around it.  I can&#39;t understand how these other mom&#39;s can see that  if he is <br/>\n3 and in school he is not homeschooling and certainly not  unschooling.  <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nJust a couple of my thoughts,<br/>\nPam G<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Unschooling Thought","postDate":"1093274102","msgId":20392,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFjNS4xY2UxNTY2Mi4yZTViNjNmNkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":20388,"nextInTopic":20393,"prevInTime":20391,"nextInTime":20393,"topicId":20387,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/23/04 8:11:03 AM, pamhartley@mindspring.com writes:    I know what I think, but it doesn t match everyone","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1649013410\">In a message dated 8/23/04 8:11:03 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamhartley@...\">pamhartley@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Nobody knows for sure. &lt;g&gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI know what I think, but it doesn&#39;t match everyone else&#39;s thoughts. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Some of us will claim to have unschooled our children from birth.
