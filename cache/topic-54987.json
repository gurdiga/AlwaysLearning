A baby needing attention is","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1152634424\">My general guideline is that a physical need trumps an emotional need, hands down, immediately, as valid as emotional needs are. A baby needing attention is basically in that category. If we can&#39;t find a way to meet both simultaneously, it is my role in the family to firmly insist on others not getting in the way of whichever person getting help. Being firm about that is not something I would consider bullying at all even if my annoyance is visible. <br/>\n<br/>\nLately we&#39;ve been at the park until someone has a physical need to leave--we need a potty, or one of us has burned through allll the snacks and is running out of fuel, or the dog is about to pee the carpet, etc. I can sympathize, make plans to return, talk about fun things we&#39;ll do at home, use a bunch of &quot;one more thing,&quot; &quot;do you want me to fly you to the car or do you want to walk&quot; etc kind of strategies but there is really a point at which We Are Leaving. On the rare occasion that I am starting to feel like I am going to lose my temper I will tell her as calmly as possible that she has only 2 choices left: She can leave now with a happy mommy, or she can leave now with a grumpy mommy. It&#39;s the honest truth. If she says &quot;happy&quot; I somehow find a reserve of playfulness on the way out. If she doesn&#39;t say anything I say, &quot;Oh, so you must want a grumpy mommy&quot; and do my best chasing troll mommy impression. Somehow, it works. The grumpy troll mommy hustling her to the car is sort of funny. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have another child and I don&#39;t know how similar this is but up until when K was 2 1/2 (she just turned 3) I was the primary caregiver for several terminally ill family members and to a certain degree, she got it. I would often tell her I didn&#39;t want to do whatever thing for whomever right then either but I was going to &quot;because nothing is more important than taking care of the people you love.&quot; And that we had to do it, because they couldn&#39;t do these things for themselves. She was younger, and maybe an element of it was me just being calmly firm, but often right after I said that she would shift gears abruptly and talk excitedly about getting a ride on Grandpa&#39;s wheelchair or something like that. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps. I always appreciate everyone talking about anything about kids my daughter&#39;s age--I learn so much! <br/>\n<br/>\nAlex<br/>\nmama to Katya, 3 yrs</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Young child and not listening","postDate":"1276736855","msgId":55029,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYwMDMyMi40NTU2LnFtQHdlYjExMDQwNS5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGh2YmduaCt2bnIwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGh2YmduaCt2bnIwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":55028,"nextInTopic":55030,"prevInTime":55028,"nextInTime":55030,"topicId":54987,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***I didn t think anyone wanted a verbatim account of the situation, so I took liberty to summarize.

But that seems to have led to <br/>\nmisunderstanding of my actions and the situation.  Here are some more <br/>\ndetails that will, perhaps, clarify what happened and how I was not <br/>\ncomfortable with my response to my daughter&#39;s slowness at coming inside.***<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter having read all of the responses, I think people understood perfectly what was going on.  Most people on this list either have had or currently have 3 yr olds.  What you are going through and what you are describing is very common.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I initially told my daughter when we got the baby to sleep in his crib <br/>\nthat we could go outside for about an hour.  My expectation for his nap <br/>\nwas off, therefore I didn&#39;t expect to have to go inside at 45 minutes.***<br/>\n<br/>\nMost 3 yr olds have no concept of time in this way.  In an ideal world we all get exactly the time we need to do what we need to do, but life is messy.  In each interaction a parent gets to make decisions that impact their kids.  The goal is to have more positive than negative.  So, even if you usually would allow for transition time, many times with 2 kids, that just won&#39;t be possible, so working towards the next positive interaction, the next positive decision, for both kids is the goal.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***As for slapping, our response has been that we treat people as we want <br/>\nto be treated.  But for this child, maybe for most 3 yo, empathy isn&#39;t <br/>\neasily understood.  And this is where I feel like breakdowns in my <br/>\npeaceful parenting keep occurring.  She couldn&#39;t empathize with her <br/>\nbrother who was getting more upset.  She has a hard time empathizing <br/>\nwith me when I tell her not to hit me.***<br/>\n<br/>\nMost 3 yr olds absolutely can&#39;t empathize.  It is completely unrealistic to expect it at all!  Trying to get a 3 yr old to empathize is counter productive!  The focus should be on tangible concrete things.  &quot;The baby needs my attention right now and you need to come inside to do this.&quot;  That is concrete.  The 3 yr old doesn&#39;t need to feel the pain of the infant in order to know that the baby needs attention NOW.  Same with hitting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Chamille was little, we used to play biting games.  We started it because she wouldn&#39;t stop biting and it hurt.  Instead of working with her to get her to stop, because she wasn&#39;t aware that she should, we played biting games until she KNEW that it hurt.  It was both fun and painful, fun to play with pain.  It was a game that she liked to play, one that she knew would and could cause pain.  She stopped trying to bite others as a result of that game.  She got enough biting from the biting game.    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":255388392,"authorName":"Kelly Halldorson","from":"&quot;Kelly Halldorson&quot; &lt;kelly@...&gt;","profile":"kellygrafx","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Young child and not listening","postDate":"1276735144","msgId":55028,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI3NTFBMTMxN0EwQjQ0RjA4Nzg2NTg0MUNFOTJBODJDQFBIUFZpZGVvVkFJTz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDg2OTU4MC4zMjQ4MS5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDkubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGh2YjBzYStrN2ExQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8ODY5NTgwLjMyNDgxLnFtQHdlYjExMDQwOS5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":55027,"nextInTopic":55029,"prevInTime":55027,"nextInTime":55029,"topicId":54987,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

My plan had been to have us go inside after an hour, which would have worked perfectly if the baby had slept that long.  And I would have allowed time for my daughter to come in at her pace.  When I first heard the baby on the monitor, I explained that we had to go inside, and my 3 yo started following me around to the garage.  When I turned the side of house and waited for her, she did not appear.  The baby was starting to get upset at this time.  That is also when she decided she needed to go the long way around and slowly ride her scooter back into the garage.  I caught up with her when she was getting on her scooter.  That is when I yelled and I ended up carrying the scooter into the garage to hurry up the process.  This resulted in her tears and yelling that she wanted to take it into the garage &quot;all by herself.&quot;  But this accomplished the deed of getting her inside so I could get the baby.

Several times, she touched pieces and we had to reset them, at which point, I reiterated that touching the wet glue would delay the fixing process, as I wrote curtly, &quot;don&#39;t touch wet glue.&quot;  The pieces were on the kitchen table and I was not ten feet away nursing the baby.  We&#39;ve done lots of projects before and my 3 yo has played with glue many times. In this instance, her compulsion took over her knowledge of fixing things with glue.  As for slapping, our response has been that we treat people as we want to be treated.  But for this child, maybe for most 3 yo, empathy isn&#39;t easily understood.  And this is where I feel like breakdowns in my peaceful parenting keep occurring.  She couldn&#39;t empathize with her brother who was getting more upset.  She has a hard time empathizing with me when I tell her not to hit me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe response I get from most parents I know when I seek advice about my daughter is all mainstream, bullying tactics.  With my voice, I feel like I bullied my daughter.  I respect many unschooling parents for their commitment to peaceful resolutions, which is why I solicited advice here.  <br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Vidyut Kale &lt;wide.aware@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;So parents, how do I get my otherwise independent daughter to listen to me<br/>\n&gt; when it is important that she does?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I read your post several times over the last couple of days, and I couldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; put my finger on what was niggling me. Which, at the risk of sounding very<br/>\n&gt; non-unschooling (if that exists), I think I identified. The part where you<br/>\n&gt; act seems missing. What are you DOING when she touches wet glue, or slaps<br/>\n&gt; you or doesn&#39;t cooperate with an urgent moment? Have wet glue where/when she<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t notice it. Dodge when she slaps, you have two kids, so find ways to<br/>\n&gt; not become inaccessible to one of them..... don&#39;t whisper, don&#39;t raise your<br/>\n&gt; voice, ACT as needed in the moment...?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I see nothing wrong with the urgency conveyed in &quot;Get inside NOW&quot;. For that<br/>\n&gt; matter, I doubt if I&#39;d wait 8-10 minutes for action to happen while there<br/>\n&gt; was an infant that needs attention NOW (like you said). I&#39;d probably go,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;There goes the monitor, race you to the door&quot; or something. Or, like others<br/>\n&gt; said, pick and run.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; While I don&#39;t have two kids, in your place I&#39;d probably focus on a &#39;game<br/>\n&gt; plan&#39; for when baby needs &#39;OUR&#39; attention and make the other child a part of<br/>\n&gt; the emergency response. Of course, if its an all the time thing, I&#39;d also<br/>\n&gt; have strategies for help rather than continual disruptions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think unschooling is about this kind of tiptoeing or &#39;getting&#39;<br/>\n&gt; anyone to do anything. If the urgency is in your heart, its far more real to<br/>\n&gt; enact it in that moment. I don&#39;t think its the end of the world to have a<br/>\n&gt; blazing fast response spontaneously done. If you include your daughter, its<br/>\n&gt; likely she might feel like the knight on a white horse charging in to save<br/>\n&gt; her brother rather than you disrupting her fun because you want to pay<br/>\n&gt; attention to something else that has become more important than her (of<br/>\n&gt; course she resists letting go of attention). I also don&#39;t think it is the<br/>\n&gt; end of the world if it doesn&#39;t work out like that and she is not in the mood<br/>\n&gt; to go with your emergency response, but you carry her along anyway.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Though I guess more experienced unschoolers are probably more graceful about<br/>\n&gt; it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Vidyut<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Young child and not listening","postDate":"1276723408","msgId":55020,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRDMTk0MEQwLjIwNDAwQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PGh2YmR1aCs0bXVwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGh2YmR1aCs0bXVwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":55019,"nextInTopic":55021,"prevInTime":55019,"nextInTime":55021,"topicId":54987,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Learning. <br/>\nUnschooling doesn&#39;t mean never saying &quot;don&#39;t.&quot; But it does mean finding <br/>\nways to avoid saying &quot;don&#39;t.&quot; Just ONE way is to say yes, instead. My <br/>\nhusband used to say, &quot;don&#39;t&quot; to the kids playing with tape and with <br/>\npost-it notes - it seemed so wasteful to him and not good for the kids <br/>\nto do it. Then my mom gave them tape and some other office supplies <br/>\nwrapped as a gift. After they&#39;d opened it and played with it for a <br/>\nwhile, she commented that they were sure having a lot of fun with a <br/>\nsuper cheap gift. It somehow legitimized playing with tape, for him, and <br/>\nhe didn&#39;t have the same negative feelings about it, after that. He still <br/>\nwas disturbed when they &quot;played&quot; with post-it notes, so my mom made that <br/>\nsomething they did a TON of at her house. She had a little drawer she <br/>\nkept stocked with office supplies that were entirely at the kids&#39; <br/>\ndisposal to do whatever they wanted with and she always left them <br/>\npost-it notes all over her house - even before they could read. And all <br/>\nthe grandkids would leave post-it notes for her in funny places for her <br/>\nto find. This went on for years. It wasn&#39;t hard for my kids to handle <br/>\n&quot;don&#39;t&quot; at home - they understood that was something special to do at <br/>\nGrandma&#39;s house. So - there is an example of a creative solution, but <br/>\nsome hard-core types would think my husband should have been the one to <br/>\ntotally give in. He probably would have, if I&#39;d pushed the issue. But he <br/>\nhas reasons for his feelings and they count, too. He grew up in a very <br/>\nvery different kind of life - small town in Iran, very authoritarian <br/>\nparenting, lots of punishment, no toys - and was already being stretched <br/>\nin a million different ways. If we could find a way to make him more <br/>\ncomfy in these little ways, seemed to me to be a good idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - judgment is required.

They are still <br/>\nreacting to that and don&#39;t want to &quot;do that&quot; to their own children. <br/>\nUnschooling seems to offer a philosophical or rational basis for not <br/>\ncontrolling their children.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - for them - unschooling is all about who is in control, in every <br/>\naspect of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is tricky to respond to - there are people who have the urge to <br/>\nmicromanage every aspect of their kids&#39; lives and they need to hear that <br/>\nthey really cannot control what their children learn and that trying to <br/>\ncontrol it is counterproductive to a happy learning lifestyle. They need <br/>\nto understand more about how to let go of arbitrary restrictions and <br/>\nrules and be more facilitators and supporters.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, there are others who seem to hear the above and take it to mean <br/>\nthat the parent should give all power to the child and always honor and <br/>\nobey the child&#39;s every desire, immediately, without compromise or <br/>\ndelay.  I&#39;ve seen situations, for example, where a child is hitting or <br/>\nkicking a parent, and the parent doesn&#39;t make the child stop or put the <br/>\nchild down or move away or respond to the hitting and kicking at all, <br/>\nbut keeps sweetly offering one thing after another to the child, trying <br/>\nto find something the child wants.  Unschooling does NOT mean the <br/>\nparents should become the child&#39;s punching bag. That&#39;s an extreme <br/>\nversion, though, of the kind of timidity some people seem to have, using <br/>\nunschooling as their excuse. I think the parents don&#39;t have a good sense <br/>\nof how to stay strong and clear and appropriately in charge, as the <br/>\nresponsible adult in the relationship, while still giving their child a <br/>\nwhole lot of freedom to make their own choices. Again, I think they feel <br/>\nhyper-sensitive to any hint of control and maybe are afraid they would <br/>\nbe turning into their own parents if they exert any control at all. <br/>\nMaybe they feel like there is a slippery slope there, or maybe they <br/>\nreally can&#39;t distinguish between appropriate control and too much control.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think there is a misconception that unschooling parents should never <br/>\nclearly and strongly insist on anything, but should always go completely <br/>\nalong with whatever their child wants at that moment. People feel like <br/>\nunschooling failures if their child ever has to do anything against <br/>\ntheir will and they feel like failures if their child is ever unhappy <br/>\nabout anything, even just for a few minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no rule for when a parent should insist on something. There is <br/>\njudgment involved. The focus in unschooling isn&#39;t, however, on turning <br/>\nover all power in the family to the children. The focus isn&#39;t on who has <br/>\npower and who doesn&#39;t. The focus is on creating a lifestyle that <br/>\nsupports natural learning. Parents will find themselves exerting less <br/>\ncontrol in an unschooling family, compared to most conventional families <br/>\nin which kids are schooled, because a more collaborative, cooperative <br/>\nand child-friendly lifestyle that is based more on big principles and <br/>\nless on specific rules is more conducive to creating a great environment <br/>\nfor natural learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people ask, &quot;Is this okay?&quot; or &quot;Is this unschooling?&quot; or &quot;Am I <br/>\ndoing this right?&quot; then I know they haven&#39;t really got the idea of <br/>\nunschooling, yet, because they are still thinking that others are going <br/>\nto be able to actually answer such questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, when faced with a difficult situation (such as the one that <br/>\nstarted of this thread) think quickly of a couple of choices and quickly <br/>\nask yourself, &quot;Which will lead to more happiness in our lives?&quot; &quot;Which <br/>\nchoice will better support learning?&quot;  Pick the best of the choices you <br/>\nhave thought of. If your only two options seem, at the moment, to be <br/>\n&quot;leave my daughter in real danger near an open pond&quot; versus &quot;pick her up <br/>\nand carry her with me into the house, even though she&#39;s screaming and <br/>\nfighting me,&quot; then isn&#39;t the better of those two choices clear?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Then, later, think back about how you got into that particular <br/>\nsituation and see if you can come up with another option - especially <br/>\nsee if you can come up with an option that avoids you getting into that <br/>\nsituation. If it seems to you tht it is unavoidable that such situations <br/>\nare going to happen, then come up with other options about how to react.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a process - it is what life with children is like. We might <br/>\nstart out with general ideas/principles, but we don&#39;t start out with the <br/>\nanswers to specific situations, we work them out as we go along. We make <br/>\nbetter and better choices, over time, with practice, and we figure out <br/>\nhow to set up situations, in advance, so that life is simpler and <br/>\nhappier and more supportive of our own children with their own unique <br/>\ninterests and needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":326782993,"authorName":"Vidyut Kale","from":"Vidyut Kale &lt;wide.aware@...&gt;","profile":"vidyutgore","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Young child and not listening","postDate":"1276709601","msgId":55000,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGltMk5Td3JJX2lQQ2NMdW9BRzhpQ2drTXEwdjVpS2xTcnpSeXdFcEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGh2OWRwcitkN2FuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGh2OWRwcitkN2FuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54999,"nextInTopic":55001,"prevInTime":54999,"nextInTime":55001,"topicId":54987,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"So parents, how do I get my otherwise independent daughter to listen to me when it is important that she does?

Which, at the risk of sounding very<br/>\nnon-unschooling (if that exists), I think I identified. The part where you<br/>\nact seems missing. What are you DOING when she touches wet glue, or slaps<br/>\nyou or doesn&#39;t cooperate with an urgent moment? Have wet glue where/when she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t notice it. Dodge when she slaps, you have two kids, so find ways to<br/>\nnot become inaccessible to one of them..... don&#39;t whisper, don&#39;t raise your<br/>\nvoice, ACT as needed in the moment...?<br/>\n<br/>\nI see nothing wrong with the urgency conveyed in &quot;Get inside NOW&quot;. For that<br/>\nmatter, I doubt if I&#39;d wait 8-10 minutes for action to happen while there<br/>\nwas an infant that needs attention NOW (like you said). I&#39;d probably go,<br/>\n&quot;There goes the monitor, race you to the door&quot; or something. Or, like others<br/>\nsaid, pick and run.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I don&#39;t have two kids, in your place I&#39;d probably focus on a &#39;game<br/>\nplan&#39; for when baby needs &#39;OUR&#39; attention and make the other child a part of<br/>\nthe emergency response. Of course, if its an all the time thing, I&#39;d also<br/>\nhave strategies for help rather than continual disruptions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think unschooling is about this kind of tiptoeing or &#39;getting&#39;<br/>\nanyone to do anything. If the urgency is in your heart, its far more real to<br/>\nenact it in that moment. I don&#39;t think its the end of the world to have a<br/>\nblazing fast response spontaneously done. If you include your daughter, its<br/>\nlikely she might feel like the knight on a white horse charging in to save<br/>\nher brother rather than you disrupting her fun because you want to pay<br/>\nattention to something else that has become more important than her (of<br/>\ncourse she resists letting go of attention). I also don&#39;t think it is the<br/>\nend of the world if it doesn&#39;t work out like that and she is not in the mood<br/>\nto go with your emergency response, but you carry her along anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough I guess more experienced unschoolers are probably more graceful about<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nVidyut<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Young child and not listening","postDate":"1276708554","msgId":54999,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGh2YjBzYStrN2ExQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGh2OWRwcitkN2FuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54998,"nextInTopic":55000,"prevInTime":54998,"nextInTime":55000,"topicId":54987,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... *********** It can help to step away from the idea that there are times when a young child needs to follow directions - that sounds a little wacko, but","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1652287740\">--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;o_jeansullivan&quot; &lt;o_sully@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;With explicit instructions like &quot;don&#39;t touch the wet glue&quot; or &quot;don&#39;t slap me&quot; it seems to take many attempts for her to follow instructions.

Another thing to consider is whether baby really needs to be alone in a bed to sleep. He may, I can&#39;t possibly know, but its worth experimenting to see if he&#39;ll sleep in other places - in a buggy or sling or whatever - to give y&#39;all more options. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Don&#39;t touch wet glue&quot; seems like the sort of instruction you could let go of entirely. Let her play in glue - its fun for little kids. If you find you&#39;re saying a lot of those kinds of &quot;don&#39;ts&quot; then look for ways to make your home more kid friendly. You have years of messy little people ahead of you! find ways to facilitate that. Have special &quot;art&quot; clothes, or use paints and glues with bare bodies - its so much easier to clean a naked girl covered in glue, paint and/or mud then to clean lots and lots of clothing (I know this from experience ;)).<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of &quot;don&#39;t slap me&quot; try &quot;I don&#39;t like that&quot;. At the same time look into why she&#39;s slapping. Is it to get your attention? Be more attentive. Is she antsy? find her other fun things to do that are really physical. Sometimes moms with active little girls get stumped - it can help to look for &quot;boy&quot; fun if she&#39;s bouncing off the walls and you&#39;re tearing out your hair. Think climbing and swinging on ropes and hitting things with sticks and bats. Think crawling around pretending to be an animal or jumping like a kangaroo. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185586397,"authorName":"lylaw","from":"&quot;lylaw&quot; &lt;lylaw@...&gt;","profile":"lylawolf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Young child and not listening","postDate":"1276708293","msgId":54998,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFEMURDMzIzQjYxMTQ0QUU5OTJCNEVENjUyQkRBQjExQEx5bGFQQz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEUxMzIwRTUyLTk2OEMtNDFFQS04Rjc4LUNCQjUwNDA0MjZBREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGh2OWRwcitkN2FuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8RTEzMjBFNTItOTY4Qy00MUVBLThGNzgtQ0JCNTA0MDQyNkFEQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54997,"nextInTopic":54999,"prevInTime":54997,"nextInTime":54999,"topicId":54987,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"so sorry I forgot to go back and cut out the post above mine.

Either someone is giving some really bad advice out there, or <br/>\nsome people are just squinting at unschooling and thinking it&#39;s a new <br/>\nset of rules they could easily break in some very non-unschooling way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never looked at unschooling, at my house. I looked at learning. <br/>\n&quot;Does this lead to learning?&quot; &quot;Is this interesting?&quot; Fun? Sweet, <br/>\nmemorable, peaceful?<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes the answer has GOT to be no. If I don&#39;t want to go in [but <br/>\nthere&#39;s a pond] means the baby is afraid or uncomfortable, then the <br/>\nanswer is NO, we&#39;re going in the house. Not maybe. Not later.

But when you&#39;re <br/>\nmeasuring and counting, that&#39;s not partnership.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m a guest this week in a home in a place that&#39;s very foreign to <br/>\nme. I hear birds I&#39;ve never heard. Everyone in the house right now <br/>\nspeaks Chinese and I don&#39;t understand a word. Jihong, her parents <br/>\nand her two children. The boy and Jihong speak English, the daughter <br/>\ndoes some of both and is too young for me to understand her yet <br/>\n(though when I tried, it turned out she was offering me water, in <br/>\nChinese). I could easily come off very, very rude here, so I&#39;m <br/>\ntreading lightly. If we go out in public, I hope they&#39;ll coach me to <br/>\nkeep me from being blatantly foreign and tacky. They would be doing <br/>\nme a favor if they did that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI *could* just do as much and whatever I want in a loud, obnoxious <br/>\nway, and they would probably keep smiling and just clean up after me <br/>\nlater if necessary. But I don&#39;t want to be that way. Because I&#39;ve <br/>\nbecome accustomed to living with the ideas of generosity and <br/>\ngratitude, I don&#39;t want to disturb their peace.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children were that way too, but I&#39;m not sure how to describe what <br/>\nwent into the development of that, although it seems to me (tongue in <br/>\ncheek, I write...) that I&#39;ve been describing and explaining for nearly <br/>\n20 years. I have, but some people go to the direct &quot;what do we do?&quot; <br/>\nand get some fateful, frightful advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t control where people get advice, and I&#39;m not keen on spending <br/>\nthe next 20 years cleaning up after misconceptions.

I think many people *are* inclined to look for rules and shifting paradigms is so much more than shifting a set of rules of course.  I also think people tend to have their minds crammed full of truisms (like &quot;children need limits&quot; and &quot;they have to learn sometime&quot; type stuff, and when they read about the ideas that are just a fluid part of unschooling for many who&#39;ve been doing it for a while, or who have made that paradigm shift, they interpret the ideas through a lens crowded with those truisms, kind of like a looking through glasses that are fogged up, or something, (or if not looking closely at all, perhaps a telescope a bird has crapped on!), and jump to conclusions about how unschooling principles are or aren&#39;t put into action, and then this huge tumbleweed of confusion and wrong assumptions grows and grows and gets more and more muddled.    so I really appreciate how you call out what is or isn&#39;t unschooling, and how you don&#39;t tolerate thoughtlessness about word choice on this list. it&#39;s very tiresome, as I have discovered, presenting that view, repeatedly, and rarely feeling understood. <br/>\n<br/>\nwarmly, lyla<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129999023,"authorName":"John and Amanda Slater","from":"John and Amanda Slater &lt;fourslaterz@...&gt;","profile":"fourslaterz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Young child and not listening","postDate":"1276705988","msgId":54995,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIxOTc3OC41NjkyOS5xbUB3ZWI1MzkwNS5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGluTmV3QnZPZDN6UVRXMk9MSzFrQ2NpN2tvMVlab2gzZnJiWHdDZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGh2OWRwcitkN2FuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8QUFOTGtUaW5OZXdCdk9kM3pRVFcyT0xLMWtDY2k3a28xWVpvaDNmcmJYd0NnQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54994,"nextInTopic":54997,"prevInTime":54994,"nextInTime":54996,"topicId":54987,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"* ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1170771873\">*<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;As an example, our two-month old baby takes irregular afternoon naps.<br/>\nYesterday he slept for three hours in the afternoon.

Your expectations are too high. Find other ways. For example, the <br/>\nbaby is crying inside -  race her to the baby or make up a quick pretend <br/>\ngame that includes looking for the crying baby. Let her pretend she&#39;s <br/>\nthe mommy who needs to go take care of the baby. Or play follow the <br/>\nleader for a few minutes. Sometimes with litte kids you can just move <br/>\nfast, sweep them off their feet and say, &quot;We&#39;ll come right back.&quot; Grab <br/>\nthe baby and a little blanket and a clean diaper and go right back out. <br/>\nYou can be in and out before she hardly has a chance to complain. Or, if <br/>\nthat seems unrealistic for your child, maybe give her a piggyback ride <br/>\ninto the house to get the baby.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - don&#39;t keep giving instructions to a kid who isn&#39;t paying <br/>\nattention. If something isn&#39;t working - stop doing it. You probably <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to get her in the habit of ignoring you, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":3007071,"authorName":"o_jeansullivan","from":"&quot;o_jeansullivan&quot; &lt;o_sully@...&gt;","profile":"o_jeansullivan","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Young child and not listening","postDate":"1276656251","msgId":54987,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGh2OWRwcitkN2FuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":54988,"prevInTime":54986,"nextInTime":54988,"topicId":54987,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Our three-year old daughter has a wild imagination, a fierce spirit, an opinion on everything, and often doesn t listen to anything we say.

Most of the time when I am ignored, it isn&#39;t a big issue and if what I have to say is important, I will find another way to say it.  But there are times when it is very important that she listens and follows directions.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs an example, our two-month old baby takes irregular afternoon naps.  Yesterday he slept for three hours in the afternoon.  Today he slept for 45 minutes.  Our daughter and I went outside during his afternoon nap (I thought we would have at least an hour outside).  I heard him wake up and start to yell on the monitor and told DD that we needed to go inside right away.  It took probably 8-10 minutes to get her inside.  Because we have a gigantic pond in our backyard and have had issues in the past with DD running off, I can&#39;t leave her alone outside at all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn a very non-unschooling way, I ended up yelling &quot;Get inside NOW&quot; several times before DD came indoors.  It was important to her to ride her scooter into the garage and to walk the long way around the house.  Unfortunately, when DD doesn&#39;t listen and it is important that she does, I always seem to end up raising my voice.  I&#39;ve tried whispering, and that is equally ignored.  With explicit instructions like &quot;don&#39;t touch the wet glue&quot; or &quot;don&#39;t slap me&quot; it seems to take many attempts for her to follow instructions.  When time is critical, like getting to my baby to comfort him, I need some tools to get DD to follow instructions.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo parents, how do I get my otherwise independent daughter to listen to me when it is important that she does?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55159,"nextTopicId":55322}}
