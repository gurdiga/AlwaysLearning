He&#39;s very concerned for her <br/>\nand has even offered to be her &quot;escort&quot; to parties if she felt it would make <br/>\nher home-life easier (she is trying to tell her parents, but that&#39;s GOT to be <br/>\ndifficult!).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, it&#39;s been a huge topic of discussion around here for years---and even <br/>\nmore so now that Kim has confided in him and me. I would not wish <br/>\nhomosexuality on my children because of the problems they&#39;d face in society <br/>\n(not to mention health-wise), but I would be VERY supportive if either boy <br/>\nwere.
