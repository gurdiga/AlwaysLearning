I am one of those moms that likes to expose my kids to many different things.  Sometimes I think my ego and fear was the motivation for doing some things.  Examples:  I signed my eldest child up for a hoity-toity art class when he was four because my friends&#39; kids were doing it.  The same with some special classes that were offered at the museum during the summer.  He didn&#39;t even enjoy it and wanted to stay home but I made him go.  I feel horribly guilty about that.  I kind of pressured my kids to play baseball because my parents love the game.  I insisted that they play and practice piano.  Yeah, I have issues.  I&#39;m learning and working to repair the disrespect I have shown them. My eldest son loves baseball so hopefully I didn&#39;t screw things up too badly.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":385215946,"authorName":"lorifla72","from":"&quot;lorifla72&quot; &lt;lorirees@...&gt;","profile":"lorifla72","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Introduction and a question about public education","postDate":"1260372150","msgId":49079,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhmb2ZibSttYm5mQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFERDBGQkNCLTM2QjktNDdFMC05OEVCLTIwNTQyNDQ5QTMyMEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":49063,"nextInTopic":49080,"prevInTime":49078,"nextInTime":49080,"topicId":48963,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Mindful parenting<br/>\ncan exist every day.&gt;&gt; <br/>\n <br/>\nYes it can and does! I&#39;ve had conversations with my MIL about how she made<br/>\nlife fun and interesting for her 2 boys after school, on weekends, and<br/>\nduring breaks. (I wouldn&#39;t call her overall approach in parenting &quot;mindful&quot;<br/>\nbut she was like an activities director on a cruise!) She took them to<br/>\nYankee games, skiing in Vermont, dinner in NYC, and made sure they went to<br/>\nmuseums, national parks, saw plays and ballets, and were involved in boy<br/>\nscouts. She said it&#39;s up to every parent to create that life for their<br/>\nchild. Schools can only do so much. Parents are supposed to fill in on their<br/>\ntime. I argued that if every parent was doing all of that, the kids wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nneed school! <br/>\n <br/>\nUnfortunately she still sees school as necessary, as a place to send your<br/>\nkids during the day so mom can have a break or do her thing. Granted, she<br/>\nwas a single mom from the time her kids were 5 and 9. Upon getting divorced<br/>\nshe had to get a job. That made her work even harder to give her kids those<br/>\nspecial experiences. I think she was trying to make up for not being able to<br/>\nbe home with them anymore. In a different marriage and with the right<br/>\nexposure, she could have been a good candidate for unschooling!<br/>\n <br/>\nHowever, she is who she is and her other grandkids are in &quot;excellent&quot; public<br/>\nschools, so she is very skeptical about our version of homeschooling. I<br/>\nthink she has backed off since Kindergarten is not a big deal, but she has<br/>\nput the pressure on my husband about where Damon is going to 1st grade.<br/>\n <br/>\nKim<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":183568025,"authorName":"Bob Collier","from":"&quot;Bob Collier&quot; &lt;bobcollier@...&gt;","profile":"quaussiebob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Introduction and a question about public education","postDate":"1260323206","msgId":49062,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhmbXZpNis5am5lQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDRCMUFFM0I3LUEyNDQtNDY5NC1BMjM3LUJEQjhDQzE1M0FFRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":49047,"nextInTopic":49063,"prevInTime":49061,"nextInTime":49063,"topicId":48963,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I have read the reviews on Amazon and ordered it.   Sandra, thanks so much for the links to the articles -- they are very helpful.  I found your site through your Leading Edge Parenting interview.  I have read many articles on your blog since then.  I am still researching and thinking.  I used to have this belief that I am not stimulating or interesting enough.  My husband and I tend to be quiet and we are immersed in our own interests (mainly reading).  I don&#39;t want to sound like we don&#39;t interact and have fun with our kids but we do tend to let them do their own thing while we do ours.  Whenever I discuss the idea of leaving school my husband does not openly object.  This is a good sign.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have always been slightly disenchanted with our school. I have never expressed this to my children.  I always exhibit a positive attitude about school around my kids because this is what my mother did.  I don&#39;t want them to think it&#39;s a miserable place.  My younger son is a good public school student -- he toes the line, but when I ask him about it he says he dislikes it.  I think he objects to sitting all day and doing worksheet after worksheet.  He is bored. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy nephew, who is five-years-old and has autism, attends the same school as my children.  He is in pre-K and was suspended last week for three days for hitting another child.   What is the goal of suspending a five-year-old with autism?  What is it supposed to teach?

What he&#39;s doing is everything of what he&#39;s doing. Which is going about his daily activities and learning as he goes. I&#39;m certainly not giving him an education. Maybe he&#39;s &quot;getting an education&quot; by osmosis. And I only describe my son as &quot;self-educated&quot; for the benefit of others, it&#39;s not a description he&#39;s ever used. It&#39;s how I describe myself. But I study, albeit informally. Hmm ... I shall have to have a ponder on that one.<br/>\n<br/>\nBob</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Introduction and a question about public education","postDate":"1260214515","msgId":49005,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc1NzUxMy4zMDc4OC5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDMubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEExQ0U5MTFDLUJGMUYtNDQ2QS04REM5LTg4RDZFMkY2RkEwNEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGhmaGxzZitiMzJhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MEY0NEM2MjQtNkVFMy00RDlFLUFBQjAtNTI1NDBFRkUxRDRGQHZlcml6b24ubmV0PiA8QTFDRTkxMUMtQkYxRi00NDZBLThEQzktODhENkUyRjZGQTA0QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48991,"nextInTopic":49032,"prevInTime":49004,"nextInTime":49006,"topicId":48963,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Guerrilla Learning: How to Give Your Kids a Real Education With or Without School I don t like the term education to be around unschooling, and it s not","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2013121460\">***Guerrilla Learning: How to Give Your Kids a Real Education With or <br/>\nWithout School<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t like the term &quot;education&quot; to be around unschooling, and it&#39;s <br/>\nnot someone anyone &quot;gives&quot; another person, either--neither <br/>\nlinguistically nor cognitively.

It&#39;s rote work intended to imprint  <br/>\ninformation into kids&#39; brains so they can spit it back for tests.  <br/>\nEducators *hope* more profound learning happens as a result of class  <br/>\ninstruction, reading and homework, but the goal is to prepare kids to  <br/>\ntake tests. Educators don&#39;t want that, but it&#39;s how the system is set  <br/>\nup. (Though most educators are convinced that what they do is  <br/>\nnecessary for learning.)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He is very bright and one of the &quot;smartest&quot; in his class.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Smart at what though? Performing for tests?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not trying to be snarky (and you did put &quot;smartest&quot; in quotes)  <br/>\nbut it&#39;s truly unfortunate that kids are subjected to a learning  <br/>\nsystem that doesn&#39;t match the way humans naturally learn -- and in  <br/>\nmany ways is counter to it -- and the ones who can do it are  <br/>\nconsidered smart and the others not so smart. All the grades really  <br/>\nmean is that someone can perform the way schools need them to. It  <br/>\nreally has nothing to do with smart. I got good grades in school  <br/>\nwithout much effort. What it really indicated is I can absorb  <br/>\ninformation without trying.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;How will I learn?&quot; &quot;How will I learn my multiplication tables?&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; &quot;When will I see my friends?&quot; etc. He says he wants to remain in  <br/>\n&gt; school and I am fine with that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Though I would tell him he can learn just fine by exploring what  <br/>\ninterests him, it&#39;s quite likely he won&#39;t believe you. ;-) Natural  <br/>\nlearning is different than school learning. Living doesn&#39;t provide  <br/>\nthe same kind of feedback that school does. You don&#39;t see the  <br/>\nprogress through a textbook or stack of papers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t sugar coat this to convince him. Be honest. He would have  <br/>\nless time with his schooled friends but he could see them after  <br/>\nschool. He&#39;d also likely meet some homeschooling kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; is it your belief that traditional school &quot;ruins&quot; kids?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It has an effect on all kids. Some manage to cope and survive. Some  <br/>\nare damaged severely. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to escape school  <br/>\nwithout picking up some screwy ideas about what learning is and how  <br/>\nto treat people. For instance in real life, cooperation and working  <br/>\ntogether toward a common goal is a good thing. But in school, it&#39;s  <br/>\nseverely punished and called cheating. The society in school doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nmatch anything in real life except maybe prison.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut forcing a child to homeschool when they&#39;re enjoying school would  <br/>\nbe worse. Let him come to the decision in his own time. Lots of kids  <br/>\nenjoy elementary school. When they hit middle school, things often  <br/>\nchange.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the younger one wants to come home, bring him home and let the  <br/>\nolder one continue with what he enjoys.

Sandra, Joyce, Pam <br/>\nand others have worked long and hard and vigorously to keep spreading the <br/>\nmessage that unschooling is a full time, lifestyle commitment to Not Doing <br/>\nSchool - in action and in thought (that&#39;s the hard part).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s like a small doorway that you squeeze through to find the whole wide <br/>\nwonderful world on the other side, all looking different after your <br/>\nexperience of squeezing through that door.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a whole set of practices that are emphatically not unschooling. <br/>\nLiving with school in your life forces you to engage in those practices <br/>\neveryday.<br/>\n<br/>\nI applaud you for wanting to be a mindful parent, which goes hand in hand <br/>\nwith unschooling - BUT can also exist without unschooling!

I love the philosophy of unschooling.  It meshes with my beliefs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think I am having some trouble making the leap because my children have always attended school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have two boys, ages 6 and 9.  They are in the first and third grade and attend public school that is one mile from my house.  I work very part-time (once a week while they are in school) and spend maximum  time with them (outside of school).  They are &quot;straight A&quot; students. They seem to do fine but I have fears that public school will squash their love of learning. (I&#39;m not sure they have a strong love a learning at this point.   Hopefully it can be rekindled.)  I think they are &quot;burned out&quot; after school and play outside and play video games and computer games.  They are learning at these times, I&#39;m probably not viewing it as such.<br/>\n<br/>\nI might be posting in the wrong forum to ask such a question but is it your belief that traditional school &quot;ruins&quot; kids?  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy eldest son races through homework with the goal of getting it over with.  There is no learning, joy, or inquisition.  It does not bother me that he hurries since I think the homework is excessive and he wants to spend after school time relaxing, playing outside, or doing other activities he enjoys.  I&#39;m certain that he is not retaining half of the work he is doing at home.  I&#39;m not sure how much he is absorbing in school.  He is very bright and one of the &quot;smartest&quot; in his class.  I think he likes school for the most part.  I have been gently discussing homeschooling and he asks me all kinds of questions, &quot;How will I learn?&quot; &quot;How will I learn my multiplication tables?&quot; &quot;When will I see my friends?&quot; etc.  He says he wants to remain in school and I am fine with that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy youngest also does well in school.  He is very keen on the prospect of unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs it possible to unschool during the weekends, after school, and summers?  I realize this question might be crazy. I do trust in my children and respect them as individuals.  I feel that I am a facilitator in their learning at home.  This hasn&#39;t always been the case.  I am an ever evolving parent and made, and still make, plenty of mistakes.  Examples: In the past I have signed them up for activities they didn&#39;t want to participate in, directed their lives in many ways, yelled a lot, forced them to practice piano,  probably sent them to preschool too young, spent too much time on the internet instead of with them, etc.  Ugh. I&#39;m glad I have seen the light and continue to learn about myself and work to become a better parent. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat should I be thinking about now?
