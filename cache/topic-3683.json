And which is better?  To never get thrilled but &gt;never be <br/>\n&gt;heartbroken, or to have ecstacy and depression?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve heard it said various ways that as high as your high is, that&#39;s how &gt;low <br/>\n&gt;your low will be too.

Now that I&#39;m 45, I feel differently (youth vs. experience).  I love the highs and I&#39;m driven to keep searching for my next passion. I&#39;ve learned how to manage the other end of the emotional spectrum.  It takes about 3 days for the intense emotions to subside as long as I don&#39;t fuel them.  So for example, if I had been passionate about the recent unschooling list argument that sent me to this list, I would not have responded or read any emails after I became angered.  In three days the anger would have subsided and I could then decide how I wanted to proceed.  That is not such a big price to pay for ecstacy.  One must learn to stay focused :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3677,"nextTopicId":3684}}
