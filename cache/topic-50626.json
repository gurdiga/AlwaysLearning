And then, if we missed two or more weeks in a row, she didn&#39;t want to go back. It took me a while to recognize the pattern - but it became unmistakable. I did not make her go back. However, once I&#39;d realized there was a pattern, here is what I did do... I would find some excuse to have to go to the place, just to say goodbye, if nothing else. Usually I could find some good reason that made some sense. For example, Roya was on a swim team and she really really loved it. But when she missed a couple of weeks because we were out of town, she didn&#39;t want to go back. So I gathered up her swim clothes and cap and towel and put them in the car and said we needed to go just tell the coach that she wasn&#39;t going to be there anymore. Once we got there, she was SO happy to be back, was greeted by all her friends and was instantly over the idea that she didn&#39;t want to go back. I said I had her swim stuff if she wanted them and she did.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>High energy and enthusiastic sounds exactly like Carly, if you&#39;re being euphemistic about it ;) <br/>\n<br/>\nDropping by the Y for some reason or another to see if it reignites her interest is definitely worth a try.

We&#39;ve also done time compromises, like when one would stay for many hours more and one wants to leave right NOW.  I&#39;ll suggest 1/2 hour longer, really sticking to that time frame.  The person wanting to leave KNOWS that there is an end in sight and the one that wants to stay KNOWS that they have time to finish doing what they are doing or play on all their favorite park toys one last time.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor our family, eventually we couldn&#39;t do outings with both kids at the same time.  My girls are 7 yrs apart and they have very little in common right now, one is 8 and the other is 15.  Instead of fighting that, we went with it.  There is way more peace for all outings, each girl gets undivided attention from a parent, or time alone, or time with a good friend.  If I&#39;d forced it they would surely despise each other right now, I could see that it would&#39;ve gone in that direction quickly because being together with their needs at odds brought out the worst in each of them.  That wasn&#39;t something we wanted at all!  When we changed directions and started doing outings separate from each other, they were kinder and gentler with each other, and while they still don&#39;t have much in common, they are way more forgiving of each other&#39;s less than stellar attributes than they were a year ago when it all came to a head.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s an extreme example, but I know that most kids love one on one time with a parent.  If the kids aren&#39;t meshing with their outings, perhaps it wouldn&#39;t be such a bad idea to leave one with another parent or a friend for an afternoon.  My sister and I were very close in age and sometimes it was really nice when she was away somewhere where I wasn&#39;t, where she wasn&#39;t sharing friends and games.  That rarely happened for me, usually we were forced to share.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":240358028,"authorName":"Kristi","from":"&quot;Kristi&quot; &lt;foehn_jye@...&gt;","profile":"foehn_jye","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: When do you start allowing children to make choices?","postDate":"1265905642","msgId":50643,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhsMWI1YStmMTloQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDRCNzM4RDVGLjYwNTA2MDBAbWFjLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":50639,"nextInTopic":50647,"prevInTime":50642,"nextInTime":50644,"topicId":50626,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My oldest is exactly the same way, whether it is gymnastics or choir or anything else that she totally loves.

Children think that the way things are is the way things are.  Then you stayed home and maybe that changed &quot;the way things are&quot; to something she likes better.  It might be that she&#39;s really making this choice and expressing her opinion for the first time, and choosing home, rather than &quot;not choosing&quot; the Y.  It&#39;s going to be up to you how you handle her expression of opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids went through various times of wanting to go to the health club and not wanting to.  One thought it was more fun than the other, and then it turned out that my older one was encountering a bully in the older area, and his parent was very weathly, so none of the staff would deal with him.  When he stole a special lego piece of my son&#39;s, the story finally came out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that this is not so likely to be your daughter&#39;s issue, but the thought behind it--that there are things in her experience there that you are unaware of, and some might not be positive--is true for all kids being separated from their parents.  It could even be the act of separation that seems scary to her now that didn&#39;t seem so scary before, because at your daughter&#39;s tender age, things like that shift around a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":301108410,"authorName":"Marina DeLuca-Howard","from":"Marina DeLuca-Howard &lt;delucahoward@...&gt;","profile":"matedgirl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] When do you start allowing children to make \tchoices?","postDate":"1265861239","msgId":50631,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3NGRmOWRjMTAwMjEwMjAwN2oxZmFlMmMxM2syZjNhODhkYzY3ZjI5MDIyQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDlhYzYyNmNjMTAwMjEwMTkzOGoyMDBkYzg1ZGxlZWVjMTc1ZjA1OWE3YTUyQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhrdm1hYStxMnNqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgkgPDlhYzYyNmNjMTAwMjEwMTkzOGoyMDBkYzg1ZGxlZWVjMTc1ZjA1OWE3YTUyQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":50630,"nextInTopic":50633,"prevInTime":50630,"nextInTime":50632,"topicId":50626,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
