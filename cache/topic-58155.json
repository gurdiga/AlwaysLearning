It is wonderful that he enjoyed the Eragon series (the movie is pretty cool too), however in the fantasy genre there are books of far higher quality, eg.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Lord of the Rings, which you already mentioned. He may want to read The Hobbit first, just to get the story in chronological order. LOTR can be hard going at times, but oh so worth it!<br/>\n<br/>\n- The Thomas Covenant Series, by Stephen Donaldson<br/>\n<br/>\n- The Earthsea series, by Ursula K LeGuin (my all-time favourite)<br/>\n<br/>\n- various series by Michael Moorcock<br/>\n<br/>\n- the Discworld series by Terry Pratchett<br/>\n<br/>\n- His Dark Materials trilogy by Phillip Pullman (absolutely brilliant)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd many more...<br/>\nGo Zac!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nClaire<br/>\nMelbourne, Australia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":143043046,"authorName":"Ed Wendell","from":"&quot;Ed Wendell&quot; &lt;ewendell@...&gt;","profile":"zelco123","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"reading first chapter book","postDate":"1290278220","msgId":58155,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUxODYzMUJERDAwNzRGRkZBNDg1QTc3QzBCNkZGRThEQEVkUEM+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":58156,"prevInTime":58154,"nextInTime":58156,"topicId":58155,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Zachariah is 16.5 and has read his first chapter book(s).

He has been reading Japanese Manga for a few years and has always loved books with great pictures and captions under the pictures but would always say he was not capable of reading chapter books.  I had gotten the first book in a series called &quot;Eragon&quot; when if first came out several years ago before he &quot;found&quot; Japanese Manga.  He was not interested in Eragon nor any of the other books I&#39;d picked up for him and they went to the book shelf.  He eventually found a love for Japanese Manga and has spent the last couple of years reading tons of Manga.  Fast forward a few years and one night he picked up Eragon and began to read it.  He read that book and asked for the other two in the series, which we got him.  While reading this series he began to talk about what he would read next.  He chose Lord of The Rings as his next reading adventure - I ordered it and it is on it&#39;s way (along with several more Manga on his reading list).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is reading with pure joy - you can see it in his face!  It just simply radiates joy!  It is also evident in his enthusiastic discussions about what he is reading.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSide info: Zachariah was in a public Montessori school from age 3 to 8.5 (mid third grade).  We never did school at home, so he has been unschooled since age 8.5.  I don&#39;t think Zac ever really had to deschool - he has never said &quot;But how will I learn such and such?&quot;  I think he already knew he learned what he knew outside of school.  I&#39;m a public Montessori school teacher so I constantly have to &quot;let go&quot; and shift my thinking.  This list is vitally important in that process.  3 or 4 years ago  I was concerned that when Zac hit his teen years I would start to worry &quot;what about this or that&quot; and I would need help.   I searched for a good group to join and I found this one.  Y-E-A !!!!!!!!!!!!  Thank you Saundra and all the other contributing members that help me and my family along our life&#39;s unschooling journey.  Ed (dad), the stay at home parent, reads this list too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58135,"nextTopicId":58207}}
