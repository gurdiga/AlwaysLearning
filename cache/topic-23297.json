You can see pictures of their costumes at <br/>\nwww.naturallynhkids.com/pb/wp_6a878265.html.  This was the first year that <br/>\nNathaniel seemed to have a sense of what was happening.  After a few houses, <br/>\nhe would call out as he turned to leave, &quot;Bye ... Happy Halloween.&quot;  <br/>\nMadeleine would then call cheerfully as we walked away, &quot;Bye ... bye ... bye <br/>\n... bye ... bye ... bye ...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe earlier part of the day was rather exhausting!  My in-laws insisted on <br/>\nhaving us drive to their house so they could see the kids in their costumes. <br/>\n  Of course, they only had limited times available in their schedules.  So, <br/>\nwe ended up going over in the early afternoon and then waiting for the <br/>\ncity&#39;s events to start.  The kids enjoyed the hay ride, story time, and face <br/>\npainting.  The pictures with Big Bird and Cookie Monster were too <br/>\noverwhelming.  We also ended up waiting in line for 20 minutes at the fire <br/>\nstation.  That would have been fine if there had been fire engines inside to <br/>\nexplore but it was just a food line for pizza, which my kids couldn&#39;t eat <br/>\nanyway.  So, that was a bit frustrating.  Also, we had just spent 10 minutes <br/>\nwaiting in line for the hay ride.  This was compounded by the fact that the <br/>\nfamily waiting behind us were not very understanding with their 2-year-old <br/>\nwho was having a hard time waiting in line, especially since his dad <br/>\ninsisted that he was not to be held.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was fun seeing a lot of families we know all dressed up in costumes :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnie<br/>\n--<br/>\nwww.naturallynhkids.com<br/>\nGreat parenting is a great career!
