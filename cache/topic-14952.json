Dh and I were out <br/>\nshopping today and he started talking about our oldest (7 dd) and how <br/>\nshe learns.  She&#39;s very stubborn and shuts right down if I (or anyone) <br/>\nattempts to get her to read or do anything she doesn&#39;t really want to. <br/>\n I&#39;m perfectly comfortable just letting her go it at her own pace, but <br/>\ndh feels that he learns the same as she does and that we need to force <br/>\nher to read and do basic math now.  His reasoning is that he also hates <br/>\nto be &quot;taught&quot; but that when forced, he will eventually get it...and so <br/>\nwill she.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s okay on most of our unschooling ways so far, but he has repeatedly <br/>\nstated that the basics of reading and math should be taught now.  A <br/>\nlittle background on him...he&#39;s pretty much a hand&#39;s off parent.  He <br/>\nloves the girls, but I&#39;m the care provider and he&#39;s the money provider. <br/>\n I don&#39;t mean this to sound like he&#39;s cold, but he&#39;s pretty much <br/>\nuninvolved.  But he does really love the girls and now he&#39;s being <br/>\ninterested, he&#39;s just not saying what I&#39;d like to hear.    I hope I&#39;m <br/>\nexplaining this well. Another example would be Aislinn&#39;s (the 7 yr old) <br/>\ngymnastics.  This has been her first year and she&#39;s AWESOME at it, but <br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t want to go back next fall.  Now she wants to try ice <br/>\nskating.  I said, great.  Dh said she should have to do gymnastics <br/>\nbecause his parents made him play baseball in little league until he got <br/>\ngood and loved it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, for the sake of his relationship with the girls and his and <br/>\nmine, I don&#39;t want to just shut him out and tell him no.  I desperately <br/>\nwant him to be more involved and right now he&#39;s taking an interest but <br/>\nif I try to push unschooling more on him now, I think it will not be a <br/>\ngood thing for any of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I didn&#39;t explain this well, maybe the right questions will make it <br/>\nmore clear.  So any questions and/or comments would be much appreciated. <br/>\n Thanks.  HeidiC.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14927,"nextTopicId":14959}}
