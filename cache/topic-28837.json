Years ago there  <br/>\nwas very little for unschoolers to find to read outside of online  <br/>\ndiscussions or back issues of Growing Without Schooling, and  <br/>\ngradually over the years more and more articles and best-of  <br/>\ncollections showed up on webpages that can be found even with  <br/>\ngoogle!  So it&#39;s just easier, nowadays, for people to get the answers  <br/>\nto the basic questions than it used to be and I think it&#39;s great for  <br/>\nthem.   One can read more now in a day than we could read in a year,  <br/>\nwhen my oldest was five.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood for all of you!  Good for me.  Good for all involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"jenstarc4","from":"&quot;jenstarc4&quot; &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: forum?","postDate":"1180126664","msgId":28840,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGYzN2lrOCtsaGdyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ2NTVGMDk0LjcwNjA2QHNpeHJlZGhlYWRzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":28837,"nextInTopic":28871,"prevInTime":28839,"nextInTime":28841,"topicId":28837,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

There are tons of <br/>\nyahoo groups about unschooling but not all of them are any good.  In <br/>\nfact there are a few that are very &quot;hopping&quot;, but all drivel, IMO, and <br/>\na waste of my time!  I feel that way about the one linked to the old <br/>\nunschooling dot com boards.  It&#39;s almost shameful!  There are a couple <br/>\nof good ones that you might like, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled/</a><br/>\nand maybe, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shinewithunschooling/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shinewithunschooling/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe alwaysunschooled one is good, but it is really directed towards <br/>\nthose with younger kids.  The shinewithunschooling is really good too, <br/>\nmostly because of the people that post there!<br/>\n<br/>\nI check them sometimes but this list is by far my favorite!
