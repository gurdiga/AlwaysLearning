So much of what she says about respectful parenting, spoiling a child etc really rings true with me. There are things that my partner and I do routinely in terms of discipline with my stepson, because it is the &quot;acceptable&quot; mainstream way of doing things, and I never even thought of the effect it has until reading it - eg taking toys away because he has been &quot;bad&quot;. I just wanted to thank you so much for pointing me in this direction -in all my parenting endeavours I will try to take a deep peaceful breath and do things from a place of love and acceptance.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow cool, huh!  I shared Sandra&#39;s link on my Living Natural group, we have a thread going on unschooling.
