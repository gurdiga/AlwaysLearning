This comes right off the FlyLadyMentor&#39;s email<br/>\nlist, so I&#39;m giving credit right up front.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   Wilbur and Martha were happily married for<br/>\nnearly forty  years. The only friction in their marriage<br/>\nwas caused by the husband&#39;s habit of breaking wind<br/>\nnearly every morning as he awoke.<br/>\n   <br/>\n   The noise would always wake up Martha and<br/>\nthe smell would cause her eyes to water as she would<br/>\nchoke and gasp for air. Nearly every morning she<br/>\nwould plead with him to stop ripping one in the<br/>\nmorning. Herman told her that he couldn&#39;t help it. She<br/>\nbegged him to visit a doctor to see if anything could be<br/>\ndone, but the husband wouldn&#39;t hear of it. He told<br/>\nher that it was just a natural bodily function, and<br/>\nthen he would laugh in her face as she tried to wave the<br/>\nfumes away with her hands. She told him that there was<br/>\nnothing natural about it and if he didn&#39;t stop, he<br/>\nwas one day going to &quot;fart his guts out&quot;.<br/>\n   <br/>\n   The years went by and Martha continued to<br/>\nsuffer and Herman continued to ignore her warnings<br/>\nabout &quot;farting his guts out&quot; until one Christmas morning.<br/>\nBefore dawn, Martha went downstairs to prepare the<br/>\nfamily feast. She fixed Christmas pudding, mashed<br/>\npotatoes, gravy and of course a turkey. While she was<br/>\ntaking out the turkey&#39;s innards, a thought occurred to the<br/>\nwife as to how she might solve her husband&#39;s problem. With a<br/>\ndevilish grin on her face, she placed the turkey guts into a bowl<br/>\nand quietly walked upstairs hours before her flatulent husband would<br/>\nawake.<br/>\n   <br/>\n   While he was still soundly asleep, she<br/>\npulled back the covers and then gently pulled back her<br/>\nhusband&#39;s jockey shorts. She then placed all of the turkey<br/>\nguts into her husband&#39;s underwear, pulled them up,<br/>\nreplaced the covers and tiptoed back downstairs to<br/>\nfinish preparing the family meal.<br/>\n   <br/>\n   Several hours later she heard Herman awake<br/>\nwith his normal loud ass trumpeting. This was soon<br/>\nfollowed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of<br/>\nfrantic footsteps as her husband ran to the upstairs bathroom.<br/>\n   <br/>\n   Martha could not control herself and her<br/>\neyes began to tear up as she rolled on the floor<br/>\nlaughing. After  years of putting up with him she had<br/>\nfinally gotten even.<br/>\n   <br/>\n   About twenty minutes later, Herman came<br/>\ndownstairs in his blood stained underpants with a look of<br/>\nhorror in his eyes. She bit her lip to keep from<br/>\nlaughing and she asked him what was the matter.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Honey,&quot; he said. &quot;You were right - all those years you<br/>\n warned me and I didn&#39;t listen to you&quot;.<br/>\n   <br/>\n   &quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Martha.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Well you<br/>\nalways told me that I would end up farting my guts<br/>\nout one of these days and today it finally happened.<br/>\n   <br/>\n   But by the grace of God and these two<br/>\nfingers, I think I got &#39;em all back in.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma *","from":"&quot;zenmomma *&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Poop/Patron saints of Church of Holtism","postDate":"1009558402","msgId":1709,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxMjlrWkN2aGtxczJYMG5UMzAwMDAxMTBhMUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":1700,"nextInTopic":1741,"prevInTime":1708,"nextInTime":1710,"topicId":1586,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve decided to adopt some new expletives in honor of the Church of Holtism.
