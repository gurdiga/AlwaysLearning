What I didn&#39;t expect to find though is that my happiness is really a choice.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe parenting world is full these days of parents thinking they can stabilize their children&#39;s moods, and ensure their creativity, by controlling their diets.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the talks I gave in Sacramento last weekend was &quot;Happiness Inside and Out.&quot;  There might be a recording for sale before long, and I&#39;ll announce it here if so.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn that I told the story of my dad having said to me, when I was in my mid-teens, that I just needed to decide to be happy.   And I thought he was really an idiot to think such a thing.  But it&#39;s been decades now since I knew it, bone deep, to be a simple, plain truth.  I wish instead of just crying and grunting (or whatever I did) I had taken a breath and asked &quot;like how?&quot;  Because he could have told me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad was almost always smiling, even when he was in his late 40&#39;s and early 50&#39;s and nearly completely crippled with arthritis.  He was happy and smiling even when living with my mom, and I know she could be pretty harsh and unwelcoming all kinds of ways.   His smiles are some of the best memories of my childhood.  He knew how to be happy, and was wanting to share that with me, and I wasn&#39;t ready to hear it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I sit there trying to tweak the options to get the face I want and maybe not the face that matches my initial mood. My mood actually morphs to match the face I really want and I walk away feeling happier than when I started.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people make choices, and then beter choices, and bettter-better choices over weeks and months, the old bad choices can become almost impossible to reach anymore, they&#39;re so far beyond that place.  When I&#39;m deciding how to be with Holly (we had a disagreement yesterday) I&#39;m thinking of ways to stop the argument, not ways to prolong or escalate it.  I&#39;m thinking of things to say to make us both feel at peace, not ways to make me right and her wrong.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she was ten, and not twenty, and I was trying to affect her mood or behavior, I didn&#39;t think of punishments, I thought of encouragement.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my kids were little, though, and my knowledge and options were smaller, my better choices weren&#39;t nearly as good as they were years later, when I was accustomed to he incrementally-increased &quot;better.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is beautiful:  &quot; It also helped me to separate tiredness or other small discomforts from my feeling of happiness. I learned that just because I&#39;m tired doesn&#39;t mean I have to be grumpy, too. It&#39;s amazing how I can turn entire days around.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy leg was hurting pretty badly the other day, and I used it as a partial reason to have been short with Keith.  He had had a REALLY long bad day at work, though, and my leg pain was minor to that, so I took Tylenol and paid more sweet attention to Keith, and we were all happier.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":156418579,"authorName":"dana_burdick","from":"&quot;dana_burdick&quot; &lt;DanaBurdick@...&gt;","profile":"dana_burdick","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Example of gratitude and abundance","postDate":"1344695654","msgId":68535,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGswNXFoNitmYzc5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwOTdDN0JELTJDMTYtNENBMC1BOTdBLUQyMTZBOUQzNzk2OEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":68530,"nextInTopic":68537,"prevInTime":68534,"nextInTime":68536,"topicId":68529,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have this diet program on the computer that allows you to enter your moods: Happy, Very Happy, Sad, Peaceful, Angry, Hungry, Tired and so on.

The moods are translated into a smiley face or not so smiley face depending on what you entered.   The faces are displayed on a calendar so you can track your moods along with the foods you ate on any given day.  It&#39;s pretty cool and has been fairly helpful in figuring out how many calories I really need and what foods work best to keep my mood stable.  What I didn&#39;t expect to find though is that my happiness is really a choice.  If I have had a few happy days in a row and there sitting right in front of me are cute little happy faces :) :) :), I am reluctant to make a sad or angry face.  I sit there trying to tweak the options to get the face I want and maybe not the face that matches my initial mood.  My mood actually morphs to match the face I really want and I walk away feeling happier than when I started.    Now, even without the program, I sometimes go through options in my head and ask myself, am I really hopelessly sad, say, or can I just choose to be happy instead.  It also helped me to separate tiredness or other small discomforts from my feeling of happiness.  I learned that just because I&#39;m tired doesn&#39;t mean I have to be grumpy, too.  It&#39;s amazing how I can turn entire days around.  If I had not seen it so graphically, I wouldn&#39;t have believed that it is possible to choose happiness so easily.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Dana</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":231415297,"authorName":"chris ester","from":"chris ester &lt;chris.homeschool@...&gt;","profile":"chris_e_bear","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Example of gratitude and abundance","postDate":"1344652149","msgId":68530,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBTXVqbWR2VS05b3NudTh6T284dEJFQWZpWlFjVmQzWjgxczZwb2NwblZqWEJzTmZzUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwOTdDN0JELTJDMTYtNENBMC1BOTdBLUQyMTZBOUQzNzk2OEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwOTdDN0JELTJDMTYtNENBMC1BOTdBLUQyMTZBOUQzNzk2OEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":68529,"nextInTopic":68535,"prevInTime":68529,"nextInTime":68531,"topicId":68529,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you for sharing your gratitude and abundance in such an open way.
