It<br/>\n&gt; just proves that one is either a good test taker or has memorized<br/>\n&gt; information in order to answer test questions. (Maybe those are essentially<br/>\n&gt; the same thing.) But if one is required to show proof of learning to the<br/>\n&gt; state through test scores and/or paperwork done by the children, one can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; just say, &quot;Oh, we unschool so we don&#39;t do that.&quot; The state will not accept<br/>\n&gt; that answer and either require that the work be done or the child(ren) be<br/>\n&gt; sent to school.

The state could require school<br/>\n&gt; attendance if the children consistently score poorly on those tests.

I can&#39;t help myself and I consider myself lucky because school didn&#39;t kill it for me (although it was a close call). Just because I&#39;m not force-feeding my kid history doesn&#39;t mean that he isn&#39;t being exposed to it in hundreds of different ways. He&#39;s also a child who wanted to know all about ancient Egypt when he was quite small because he pulled a book off my husband&#39;s shelves that is full of ancient Egyptian art and symbols. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou know the weirdest thing about that interview, though, wrt to history? Is how history got linked into literature. It started with Henry James. Mark Twain. Shakespeare. I can appreciate that the works of these authors epitomize the attitudes and behaviours of a specific period in history (and can be construed as social commentary on some level), but then to tie it into history? It was just a weird moment... I thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the bit from the transcript:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What happens when the learning becomes more sophisticated and her kids need to be exposed to Shakespeare or Twain or Henry James?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;&quot;I think a lot of people might value that more than others. That that is important and it is part of someone&#39;s life. I honestly don&#39;t remember, yes, although I know their names, I don&#39;t remember the details of what I learned in school about the historians,&quot; Martin said.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, in the real interview, Juju says (in between those two statements), &quot;How can you teach them the great works or the great historians if you can&#39;t get them to sit down and learn?&quot;, so it annoys me a little they left that out of the transcript as it makes it look like Dana doesn&#39;t know the difference between Shakespeare and a historian. <br/>\n<br/>\n- Rebecca</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Money/Reward from Advocacy was ABC News/Nightline unschooling st","postDate":"1276019355","msgId":54728,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUzMTE3OC40NjAzMC5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MTYubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGh1bHJwbStldHFjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGh1bHJwbStldHFjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54726,"nextInTopic":54732,"prevInTime":54727,"nextInTime":54729,"topicId":54653,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***I don t know how likely it is for an unschooled child to score so poorly on a test that they would be required to attend school.

A parent need not ever look at the test results.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich brings me to the reason that my oldest is now compliant... In our state, in order to get a driver&#39;s permit, one must get approval from the school or the service district, so homeschoolers must also get permission from the service district and must be compliant with the laws to do so.  Maybe that&#39;s a bit to locally off topic, BUT kids will do what they need to do to get what they want, even to take a test to take a test.  (take required school test to take required driver&#39;s permit test)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe laws are about homeschooling, not about unschooling.  Many homeschoolers actively work to keep the laws in check and actively work to lessen the requirements and the regulations for all homeschoolers, unschooling ones included.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a parent&#39;s job to buffer their kids from damage.  Testing doesn&#39;t need to be damaging.  No weight needs to be put on it.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/testing/tests\">http://sandradodd.com/testing/tests</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Money/Reward from Advocacy was ABC News/Nightline unschooling st","postDate":"1275923874","msgId":54684,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGh1ajJqMitzaTJpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlucjVYTmpVZFVQV1NCYmJEVmtNdWtnVnJsUHVCS1F5amFfck5KUEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":54679,"nextInTopic":54688,"prevInTime":54683,"nextInTime":54685,"topicId":54653,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"==I want to point out that unschooling IS legal in the U.S.== In every state?

Doesn&#39;t that sort of make unschooling illegal because it requires testing and/or the production of &quot;work&quot;, which is contrary to unschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just curious because I&#39;ve homeschooled in 2 different states so far and the laws for each are very different. One state gave several options for showing progress in your child. One of those options was to submit a written summary of everything the child did for that school year. I can see that as very easily fitting into unschooling without disturbing the flow. The other state requires annual standardized tests with no alternatives. No matter what else you do, you must administer a nationally standardized test to your child every year. If you can&#39;t provide a copy of that completed and graded test, you could lose your right to homeschool. Doesn&#39;t that, in a sense, make unschooling illegal since you can&#39;t decline administering the test?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlysia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Money/Reward from Advocacy was ABC \tNews/Nightline unschooling st","postDate":"1275881527","msgId":54679,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGltNEdENkNSTVNFbkpPQ1U4UHVGSUNiamRfNElQZW45M3JKUFFoWkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlucjVYTmpVZFVQV1NCYmJEVmtNdWtnVnJsUHVCS1F5amFfck5KUEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEFBMTZDNEM0RUZBRTRBNjdCOTVFQTk3NjMwRkJDRjExQGVuZHJlc3RzMDd3Z29qPgk8QUFOTGtUaWxNWEtIR0RjQ3ZiTHlDUUZxZm8yWjlJeTNsa2QyOVlGRjgzYUNiQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgk8QUFOTGtUaW5yNVhOalVkVVBXU0JiYkRWa011a2dWcmxQdUJLUXlqYV9yTkpQQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54678,"nextInTopic":54684,"prevInTime":54678,"nextInTime":54680,"topicId":54653,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"That last sentence got cut off: It should be They support me and my decision about how I m homeschooling Karl but don t find the details about unschooling","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1292280487\">That last sentence got cut off:<br/>\n<br/>\nIt should be &quot;They support me and my decision about how I&#39;m homeschooling<br/>\nKarl but don&#39;t find the details about unschooling fascinating.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sun, Jun 6, 2010 at 11:30 PM, k &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katherand@...\">katherand@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt; One person wrote: The more normalized it becomes the more accepting<br/>\n&gt; people will<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; eventually be.

And there&#39;s always more learning to come, new awareness, new insights.

We sometimes talk about developing our &#39;elevator speech&#39; to describe unschooling to the curious, but we don&#39;t ever assume we&#39;ll bring those people to an understanding of unschooling in just those few moments.  While some people get it sooner than others, for most, applying unschooling principles is an on-going evolution.  It can take years.  Many years.  Why would we expect that anyone seeing a strongly biased 5 minute segment in the national media will actually understand it much less respect it?  Again, it&#39;s not worth the negative liability to reach the possible few who might be drawn to unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Robin wrote:<br/>\n I am not hiding in any shadows, I am <br/>\nchoosing to live my life focusing on my relationships with my husband and children instead on focusing that <br/>\nenergy outward.
