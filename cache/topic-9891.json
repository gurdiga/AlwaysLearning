He makes up the most wonderful stories. <br/>\nOne of his stories started four or five years ago.  He watched a lot of<br/>\nGodzilla movies and always felt sorry for the monsters getting shot up,<br/>\netc.  He thought of a story called &quot;Monster Doctors&quot; where all the<br/>\ncharacters were taken from our pets and other critters he knew and they<br/>\nworked together as a team  to heal and help monsters.  This is still an<br/>\nongoing story, with new characters, bad guys, and plot twists.   He has<br/>\nat least four other stories going at all times.   He can keep characters<br/>\nstraight and story lines straight and they&#39;re always interesting.  When<br/>\nhe adds a new character, or when one gets maimed&lt;g&gt; he draws a picture so<br/>\nI can get the full effect.  <br/>\nQuite remarkable. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":60467660,"authorName":"louisam1@juno.com","from":"louisam1@...","profile":"louisam1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Trolls and duck lovers","postDate":"1035396767","msgId":9923,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIxMDIzLjE0NTc0MS4tNDcwMjczLjkubG91aXNhbTFAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":9896,"nextInTopic":10012,"prevInTime":9922,"nextInTime":9924,"topicId":9891,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oh Deb, what a great story!

We went walking down<br/>\nby the river.  There is an observation deck there, built out over the<br/>\nwater and we sit there sometimes in the early mornings and watch the<br/>\nbeavers and muskrats and herons.  Dylan climbed under it today to look<br/>\naround and I sprawled on the deck and hung my head over to look at him. <br/>\nWe saw muskrat foot prints in the mud, and imagined it to be a sort of<br/>\ndry muskrat meeting area there under that big platform.   He banged his<br/>\nhead once, but not too hard, he found a slender stick and tried to poke<br/>\nmy shoes with it through the cracks.  He watched the tiny little fish<br/>\nhiding in the shadowy shallows.  He crawled around for a long time while<br/>\nI sat and counted ducks up the river and ducks down the river and ducks<br/>\nflying overhead.<br/>\nWhen he scrambled out and came to sit beside me I was writing the names<br/>\nof all the ducks I  had seen and I checked my book one last time to be<br/>\nsure of the spelling&#39;s, etc.  I said - you&#39;re so patient with your duck<br/>\nloving mother-- and he said  &quot;You&#39;re so patient with your troll boy.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nSo tonight he&#39;s working on a story called Trolls and Duck lovers and<br/>\nthere&#39;s some thing about a mob of angry ducks and he&#39;s doing this<br/>\nterrible Edward G Robinson voice  &quot;Quack, see....Quack.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9996,"nextTopicId":10011}}
