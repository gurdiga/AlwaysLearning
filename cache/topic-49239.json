I&#39;m the one who started this topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince that day, a few days ago, I have given my kids free choice on video games.  One is playing My Sims Agent and the other is building Bionicles and really going to town with his imagination.  I love it when they pretend and play and I get to watch them do this.  It&#39;s so fun.  I was so excited to let everyone know my comfort levels at watching my kids make choices for themselves and not make choices because they are afraid they are not going to get to make the choices they want... Hope that made sense to you all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really thought that video games would be the only choice that they would ever make.  WOW!!  They are showing more interest in doing things even besides video games.  One of them found a pop up timer for a roast.  We had so much fun experimenting with different water temperatures and this got us started on all other kinds of measuring tools and we had a blast. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn summary, I believe that by me relaxing up and letting them make their choices, they have been free to actually decide all on their own when not to play video games and pursue their other interests.  I&#39;m fine with them playing video games now and enjoy watching and interacting with them, or just being near finishing a knitting project, reading or chit chatting with them.

A DSI.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids and I are loving Animal Crossing, together.  It is the first time I<br/>\ncould really *enjoy* a game with them.  Before I was supportive and<br/>\ninterested, but now my little Marina Doppelganger is moving on screen and my<br/>\nkids are enjoying teaching me how to harvest fruit, meet the locals,<br/>\ndecorate my house and pay my mortgage, as well as urging me to plant more<br/>\nflowers and go fishing.  We don&#39;t blow anybody up and its non-competitive.<br/>\nThere are no points involved. This is a game for me...purely skill  and fun,<br/>\nbut I love Wii bowling, tennis and skiing, too.  Most of the games the kids<br/>\nplay are too complex for me lol  I can appreciate their reflexes,<br/>\npersistence and the ability to delve into and memorize a vast array of<br/>\ncharacters and information...but heck I am forty-two my brain can&#39;t possibly<br/>\nbe as good, and though I knit and type, my fingers don&#39;t move as quickly as<br/>\ntheirs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI enjoy watching my kids exercise choice and revel in their discoveries.<br/>\n Choices are great.  But I have never been able to share their interests as<br/>\nfully as this one.  I am currently struggling to build virtual snowmen with<br/>\nthe encouragement of my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday we went out to a mall to try on shoes, eat sushi, bbq, and Thai food.<br/>\nMy middle son whom I am constantly being &quot;warned about&quot; ate sushi, with<br/>\noj. I think his choices are great.  He enjoys a variety of food.  I don&#39;t<br/>\ndole it based on faulty logic.  Over the course of a week he eats less of<br/>\nwhat other parents consider junkfood than the kids who need to ask and<br/>\nhave it doled out.  Those parents never believe me, because if ever they<br/>\nrelax their kids will grab the cookies and disappear in a closet until the<br/>\nbag is all gone.  They are just sure we live in chaos because my kids don&#39;t<br/>\nneed permission to eat food in particular.  I don&#39;t moniter the treats.  I<br/>\njust make sure lots of bread, peanut butter, meat, eggs, fruit and veggies<br/>\ndisappear too.  If they don&#39;t I offer platters!<br/>\n<br/>\nI had bought a large wheel of brie to give to my brother for Christmas, but<br/>\nI found out when I went to the fridge to pack the hamper the kids had<br/>\ndevoured it!  They ask with most things that might be an ingredient in<br/>\nsomething else.  (Cream, sour cream, chocolate chips generally are<br/>\ningredients in other dishes and I have been tripped up after discovering<br/>\nminutes after assembling all the other ingredients that someone ate whatever<br/>\nit was and need to get more)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis happened slowly over the course of years.  We spent time in candy shops<br/>\nand bought home lots of ice cream.  Sometimes they love a<br/>\nparticular food for ages.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther times the combinations strike me as odd.  One night three years ago, I<br/>\nthink, we had a chocolate fondue and I remember telling my son, Marty, we<br/>\ndon&#39;t dip carrots in chocolate.  I couldn&#39;t think why, so I backed off right<br/>\naway;) We were working together to set up a plate of fruit to dip in<br/>\nchocolate and he started arranging baby carrots on the platter.  It was<br/>\nstrikingly beautiful!<br/>\n<br/>\nHis response was he liked carrots and we all love chocolate.  He<br/>\nwondered what is so great about strawberries dipped in chocolate.<br/>\nStrawberries are great alone, especially when ripe and in season,<br/>\nstrawberries don&#39;t need anything.  But carrots taste really really good<br/>\ndipped in chocolate.  True wisdom indeed.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287815876,"authorName":"Robyn L.

In terms of the intent of what I am writing I thought that I was only sharing perspective not suggesting anything about others. I will probably sit back and see if I can get a better vibe for this group.  In the first rad unschooling group of which I was part I could never fully get into how to speak on the group with out feeling like I was wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut okay.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding choices as I see it life is choice.  So the &quot;have to&quot; was more for dramatic effect.  None of you know me so I can see how that was taken in a way that I did not mean it.  I simply seek to shift the energy of my home.  I am not perfect at not getting too bogged down in technology.  Like right now...I really feel that I need to be doing other things that I had planned to do but instead I am writing this email.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I find that this is the energetic vibe of my family then I won&#39;t choose to stay there.  One of the major lessons that I have learned from other unschoolers is the importance of modeling.  So I get up and go and so do my kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n==&gt;My sister said that after her kids had played at another house, years <br/>\nago, where there was a Sega Genesis system.  She told me (with her <br/>\naccustomed dramatic feeling) that her kids would NEVER have a video <br/>\ngame system, because they fought over it everytime they were around <br/>\none and she wasn&#39;t going to spend $200 on that.  I asked her if she <br/>\nwould rather spend that much money on something not worth fighting <br/>\nover.   If they&#39;re fighting over it, it must be good!   Rather than <br/>\ntake it away, maybe help them find ways to get along in the presence <br/>\nof something that absorbing and wonderful<br/>\nI don&#39;t disagree with you.  I agree with you on this.  I work with my sons to find balance.  But at some point when I see we need to choose to do something else for peace sake...then we shall.  It&#39;s break to help shift the energy as I see it.  More of a time out than a take away.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I also did not sign up for technology to take over spending time <br/>\nwith my kids.-=-<br/>\nAre you suggesting other families did?<br/>\nNope.  I am merely speaking on the thoughts that have crossed my mind regarding me and my family.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- So when I find that our person to person time is being eclipsed I <br/>\nwill call no technology time. They can do whatever they want in that <br/>\ntime.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n==&gt;If you make them turn off the games or computers because you miss <br/>\nbeing with them, does that make them want to be with you?  If they can <br/>\ndo whatever they want in that time, you mean they don&#39;t have to hang <br/>\nout with you?  But they can&#39;t use the TV or computer?   How old are <br/>\nthey again?<br/>\nNo.  That does not make them want to me with me.  I don&#39;t mind that though at times they do seek to spend time with me.  Mostly they play with each other and when they go back to playing with computers and what have you they tend to be more in synch with each other.<br/>\nThey are 6 and 9 years old.  First of all it is rare that I will say no technology.  It is when it feels like we are in a rut and beast wars is happening between the two of them that I tell them we will are ALL pulling back.  I get off it all, too, so as to not be a hypocrite and to live what I am calling them to do in that moment.  And at times I don&#39;t take a break from tv and computers and at times i call for us to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\n=<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- in my own experience i have had times when i have spent too much <br/>\ntime doing something... like surfing the net or writing e-mail and time <br/>\nhas passed and nothing has gotten done and i need to change what i am <br/>\ndoing totally.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWho decides for you?<br/>\n<br/>\nI decide for me.  I am assuming that you are saying that they should decide for themselves.  Mostly they do but when the rut happens...I feel called to do something.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-My older son used to spend massive time but since getting time away <br/>\nfrom technology he is more balanced. I don&#39;t even really have to call <br/>\nfor down time for him. He simply takes it and has other interests that <br/>\nhe pursues passionately. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n==&gt;Ah.  So because he does other things, you&#39;re taking credit for his <br/>\ndecision? <br/>\n<br/>\nNo.  <br/>\n<br/>\n==&gt;You don&#39;t have to now, but at one point you did.<br/>\nHad you not &quot;called for no technology time&quot; you probably would have <br/>\nseen (as many others her have) that the children would have done that <br/>\non their own.  Then you could have been more confident about other <br/>\ndecisions they would make in the future, and in their natural ability <br/>\nto make good choices without moms stepping in and putting limits on <br/>\nthem.<br/>\nI agree with you.  I have seen this with them, too.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n==&gt;He will never have credit for being &quot;more balanced&quot; if you feel it was <br/>\nyour doing.<br/>\nI don&#39;t feel it was my doing.  I just so happen to take note that this what is going on with him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n==&gt;It&#39;s one of the very best things about a child learning to read <br/>\nwithout &quot;being taught.&quot;  If the child can learn that and the parent <br/>\nknows it, and the child knows it, things change in wonderful ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of John Holt and other unschoolers...maybe even some of your work because I have read your site in previous years...I have had this experience with my older son.  I trust their innate wisdom.  I don&#39;t always profess to be perfect as unschooling is a new paradigm for me.  But I know that children learn to read without being taught.<br/>\n-=-as a responsible mother...i have to get him up and moving after a <br/>\nwhile. even if that means we go to the park or to the science museum.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n??<br/>\n==&gt;&quot;Even if&quot;?  We went to parks and museums all the time when my kids <br/>\nwere little.  I didn&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; get them up and moving.  They were <br/>\ninterested in the world in which they lived, even though sometimes <br/>\nthey would play video games for a long time, or watch videos they had <br/>\nalready watched, or listen to music they had already heard.<br/>\nI agree with you.  This is my experience.  Even if...not meant to mean anything really.  Maybe should have said &quot;we do many things such as...&quot;  I get myself up and moving and so they end up getting up and moving too.  Yes, we are all interested in life in general...I agree with you.<br/>\n<br/>\n==<br/>\n<br/>\nI seek to educate my children and help them understand that <br/>\ntechnology cannot cause us to get tuned out from the world.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n==&gt;I think you meant to say CAN cause, not cannot cause.  I do agree with <br/>\nwhat you wrote there at the end.  I don&#39;t think you do. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nI wrote what I meant but do agree with &quot;can cause&quot;...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only people I have seen who were &quot;tuned out from the world&quot; were <br/>\npeople like my cousin Nadine, who had suffered abuse and abandonment <br/>\nand had been sent 600 miles to live with our family, against her <br/>\nwill.  Kids I went to school with who were picked on and who had <br/>\nmeanness and violence at home could tune out any place, any time. <br/>\nVideo games weren&#39;t even invented yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n==&gt;It is interesting to me what you say.  There is some issue with technology at times though.  It can be positive and negative just depending on the use.  Do I see my kids use of it as detrimental.  No.  I just don&#39;t.  As a matter of fact I think it was writing you posted about your children that made me okay with it.  But I have had my own issues with it.  It can tune me out to the world and at times it is good but there are problematic times, too.  That is the point I was making.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-as a responsible mother...i have to -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n==&gt;As a mother, you chose to.<br/>\nYep..choose to.

I hear you.<br/>\n<br/>\n==&gt;As a contributor to this list (which I hope you will continue to be!) <br/>\nyou&#39;ve suggested that others here aren&#39;t responsible mothers.<br/>\nIn my perspective it is how you are seeing it.  I am not suggesting that other mothers are not responsible.  I am only talking about me.  I don&#39;t judge other mothers.  I am not suggesting that others are not responsible.  If that is how these words are coming across then let me clear it up now that that is not my intent.<br/>\n==&gt;Please re-read your posts before you send them to check for things <br/>\nlike &quot;I had to...&quot; and such.   Proofreading and deciding whether it&#39;s <br/>\nreally what you meant to say is better for your own thinking and for <br/>\nthose who come to read!<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain...I will have to step back and read more.  I am merely sharing<br/>\nnot suggesting anything.

He had played some the year before and liked it but no major passion for it. <br/>\nThis Summer he really got into it. This is something that he does with dad and dad is a big time basketball guy. He always played and has even been a coach so he loves it.<br/>\nTHey go many times a week to play in the club now that there is too much snow to play many times a day at home.  <br/>\nDad is not a video games type o guy and even thou he sits there to watch him play many times it is not the same as basketball.<br/>\nFor Christmas MD got  3 games he really wanted to get and spent most o the day playing his games.<br/>\nBrian turned to me on Christmas day and said that MD would be playing nothing but video games , meaning that he would not want to go play basketbal with him anymore for a while until the newness of the video games wore off.<br/>\nI told him that maybe but that I think MD would still want to go play with him.<br/>\nSo yesterday after Brian was done with chores late morning he asked MD if he wanted to go play basketball with him ( that is a normal thing for them to do ). MD got ready in 5 minutes and was happy to go with dad not only play basketball but run some erands. He took his Nintento DS with one new game to play while in the car and running erands.<br/>\nBecause MD has NEVER been limited in his video game playing I think is much easier for him to let go now.<br/>\nBrian was fearful that video games were going to keep MD from basketbal but his fears did not materialized.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://polykow.blogspot.com/\">http://polykow.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":357625083,"authorName":"Tirra-Olufemi","from":"Tirra-Olufemi &lt;tyra.general@...&gt;","profile":"tyra.general","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Here I go again...","postDate":"1261951771","msgId":49243,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc0NDQ0My4yNjg2NC5xbUB3ZWI1OTkwOC5tYWlsLmFjNC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGhoODhwdSthaXIyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhoODhwdSthaXIyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49242,"nextInTopic":49244,"prevInTime":49242,"nextInTime":49244,"topicId":49239,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Peace to you, You know I am one who feels that sometimes I have to call for no technology time.

I just have to.  When technology (wii, ds, computer, tv) begins to make my children act beastly and I am breaking up one fight after the other the technology is going off.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also did not sign up for technology to take over spending time with my kids.  So when I find that our person to person time is being eclipsed I will call no technology time.  They can do whatever they want in that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsually they finally tune into their body and realize that they are hungry, need to use the bathroom and then they will actually begin to talk to one another.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have often thought that this technique may be a bit out of line with unschooling philosophy but in my own experience i have had times when i have spent too much time doing something...like surfing the net or writing e-mail and time has passed and nothing has gotten done and i need to change what i am doing totally.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that there are other choices in the world and am grateful that have finally pulled myself away to even realize this.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy older son used to spend massive time but since getting time away from technology he is more balanced.  I don&#39;t even really have to call for down time for him.  He simply takes it and has other interests that he pursues passionately.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy younger son is 6 and is just like my older son used to be.  He get drawn in to technology and will stay there hour after hour after hour....as a responsible mother...i have to get him up and moving after a while.  even if that means we go to the park or to the science museum.  I seek to educate my children and help them understand that technology cannot cause us to get tuned out from the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nbut...again it is about balance...i need it and so do they.  i impose very few limits because i will get us up and going to the Y or park or wherever to get us up and doing other things besides engaging in technology everyday.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what works for me.  I will say that I don&#39;t sweat it.  I don&#39;t worry.  I did worry more with the first son but eventually decided that worry is a waste of time.  My kids love being on the move so I schedule fieldtrips and go other places and go play with friends to create more balance.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn unschooling I feel that it is all about the child staying in touch with his/her own innate wisdom.  I just don&#39;t have much to teach my kids and find that they learn just fine if I allow it.  However, as a leader in this family I will offer guidance especially if I see that there is some negative effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn 8 year old who can&#39;t make eye contact due to a game will make me seek to connect with him more.  I might invite him to cook with me or to read with me or to go outside with me or garden with me.  I will extend invitations to give them choices.  I find that my kids take me up on it.  That way the option is always there to stay but there is another option to help them shift their energy.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope I even make sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nTirra<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;Know Thyself.&quot;  Oracles of Delphi<br/>\nDo you really know yourself or do you only know what you have been conditioned to believe about yourself?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a Goddess:  Body, Mind, Spirit!<br/>\nwww.goddess-body-mind-spirit.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: &quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cookiesforthree@...\">cookiesforthree@...</a>&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cookiesforthree@...\">cookiesforthree@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Sun, December 27, 2009 12:25:02 PM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Here I go again...<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nYikes...
