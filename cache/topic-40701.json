Don&#39;t answer a question by telling them to &quot;look it  <br/>\nup&quot; or by asking them another question. If you know the answer, give  <br/>\nit. If you don&#39;t, then HELP them find it. Speculating about an answer  <br/>\noften leads to a good conversation. If your child stops seeing you as  <br/>\nhelpful when they have questions, they&#39;ll stop coming to you with  <br/>\ntheir questions.
