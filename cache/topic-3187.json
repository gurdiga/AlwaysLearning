I think there are wonderful things on TV -yes, we love <br/>\nFriends. Buffy is one of the best things I&#39;ve seen in any medium. Television <br/>\ncan show us amazing things and tell wonderful stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think it is somewhat addictive. I think computers are too.  Not what <br/>\nyou&#39;re playing or watching, but the medium itself. That&#39;s what makes them a <br/>\nbit different as tools than clay or cats to me. And I think some people are <br/>\nmore prone to addiction than others. So, we have no TV rules. But while I can <br/>\nsee that my daughter is generally non-addictive and excellent at regulating <br/>\nherself in most things, I see that my son, who tends to be more addictive and <br/>\nis younger, needs some help learning to regulate. I liked Pam&#39;s description <br/>\nof how it was with Roxana (?). Still no rules, but a lot of talking and some <br/>\nmild limit-setting.<br/>\n<br/>\nEver the happy medium,<br/>\nPaula</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":45073,"authorName":"amycats2@aol.com","from":"amycats2@...","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Why, oh why have the TV?
