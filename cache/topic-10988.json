The <br/>\nGirl Scouts, as you probably know, are famous for cookie sales. As a result, <br/>\nBeth is very sensitive to types of organiztion fundraising. She&#39;s an easy <br/>\ntouch for kids on sales (often actually buys GS cookies! from girls at <br/>\nchurch!), but HATES it when kids stand outside of stores just asking for <br/>\nmoney. She thinks they need to DO something for it. (It is against GS policy <br/>\nto do that.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe GS cookies sale is considered as much program as fundraising, and when <br/>\ndone correctly the girls make plans, set goals, etc.<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10980,"nextTopicId":10989}}
