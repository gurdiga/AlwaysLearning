They were really rude and<br/>\nunfriendly to her and so she doesn&#39;t want to play with<br/>\nthem again. She really doesn&#39;t like organized<br/>\nactivities very much, and so far is not interested in<br/>\n4H, Brownies, or the like (she really balks at the<br/>\nidea of a uniform). I figure if she gets desperate<br/>\nenough for more friends she may decide to get involved<br/>\nwith a group.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeghan :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend your FREE holiday greetings online!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://greetings.yahoo.com\">http://greetings.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269338,"authorName":"Cindy","from":"Cindy &lt;crma@...&gt;","profile":"crma53","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] socialization/social life","postDate":"1009832648","msgId":1969,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDMzBEMkM4LkJEOTUwRjQ3QGl4Lm5ldGNvbS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDRjLjQzNGJmNWMuMjk2MGMwNjhAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":1951,"nextInTopic":1970,"prevInTime":1968,"nextInTime":1970,"topicId":1886,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Tamzin is 7 and doesn&#39;t<br/>\nlike to travel huge long distances (there&#39;s no way<br/>\nshe&#39;d want to go to Santa Barbara for a campout!).<br/>\nShe&#39;s also quite an introvert and takes a while to<br/>\nwarm up, especially in a group situation. We used to<br/>\ngo to home schooling camps in the UK and she&#39;d just be<br/>\nmaking good connections and then it was time to go! So<br/>\nfor us, it&#39;s usually not a worthwhile trip unless it&#39;s<br/>\nwithin a 3 to 4 hour drive. What Tamzin needs is mates<br/>\nto hang out with (she likes marathon play dates). She<br/>\nhas a few good friends here now, but one of them may<br/>\nbe going back into public school (aaagh! She&#39;s already<br/>\nsuper competitive!), so that one may fizzle out<br/>\nbecause they live a 20 minute drive away as it is.<br/>\nAnother one is homeschooled in a more structured<br/>\nfashion, has a pony, and church events to attend, and<br/>\nhas limited time for playdates (once every 2 weeks if<br/>\nwe&#39;re lucky). The other one is another unschooler and<br/>\nwe see a lot of them and have become &#39;best friends&#39;<br/>\n(both mom and kid!).

They can be a little eccentric, true, but what&#39;s wrong with that? &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, it really is true that socialization is an issue for many unschooling <br/>\nkids - in the sense of having enough people around to hang out with as <br/>\nextensively as they&#39;d like. I don&#39;t think we should pretend that it isn&#39;t <br/>\nsomething to think about - something to talk about and figure out how to <br/>\nhandle. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids have fewer &quot;needs&quot; for an active social life and are more satisfied <br/>\nwith a really good friend or two than with lots of hustle and bustle and lots <br/>\nof variety of friends. They are lucky. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have found that my teens often don&#39;t relate well with teens who go to <br/>\nschool. I&#39;m sure there are many out there  they&#39;d like perfectly well if they <br/>\ngot to know them, but frequently they find that the schooled teens&#39; concerns <br/>\nseem shallow or boring and their behavior is annoying (they meet them in <br/>\nclasses - like gymnastics or theater or sports or Girl Scouts - and my kids <br/>\nare put off by the attitude the schooled kids have toward the activity or <br/>\ntoward the adult leaders/teachers).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - they really relate best to other unschooling teens -- openmindedness and <br/>\na sense of life being an adventure is what they&#39;re after, I think. Here in <br/>\nCalifornia we&#39;re lucky to have a great state-level organization that puts on <br/>\nactivities (campouts, conference) where kids can meet each other. And <br/>\nNot-Back-to-School-Camp has made a gigantic difference....the kids get <br/>\ntogether a few times a year in addition to camp and they have a LOT of online <br/>\ntogetherness. Roya is in Portland, Oregon, right now with a big group of <br/>\nNBTSCers and there is another big group of them gathered up in Edmonton <br/>\nCanada right now. In a couple of weeks a group will be meeting in Santa <br/>\nBarbara. These kids are way way way cool - wonderful, interesting people so <br/>\nfilled with ideals and dreams and excitement to be alive!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut they are very spread out geographically and there is definitely a major <br/>\nissue of money and time and safety for traveling and then there are the <br/>\nlong-distance phone bills!!!
