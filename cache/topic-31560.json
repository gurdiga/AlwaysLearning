It was a very energizing and renewing experience.  Participants took full advantage of the small size of the conference and the intimate atmosphere to connect and have in-depth conversations with other conference attendees and presenters.  Feedback was very enthusiastic, and many people asked for another conference in 2008, so here we go.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe 2008 Unschooling Conference, January 12, will feature a keynote address by Manish Jain of Shikshantar: The PeoplesÃ¢Â€Â™ Institute for Rethinking Development and Education, in Udaipur, India. We are looking forward to another exciting and fulfilling day of connecting with unschoolers, and expanding our unschooling horizons.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor more information and to download a registration form, please visit our website:   www.unschoolingconference.com.
