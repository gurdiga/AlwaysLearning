She is very <br/>\noutgoing and talkative with anyone she&#39;s comfortable with...which isn&#39;t a <br/>\nwhole lot of people. But it takes her a while to &quot;warm&quot; to people. They have <br/>\nto be very famliar. Even a clerk at the grocery store we see every week <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get a hello. She won&#39;t look at them but it seems very much to be a <br/>\nshy behavior.<br/>\nIt bothers people though. They take it personally sometimes. And asking a <br/>\nfour y.o. a huge series of questions isn&#39;t very helpful. She has told me &quot;I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to&quot; when I ask her why she won&#39;t talk to people. I&#39;ve even <br/>\nexplained that it makes some people feel bad because they just want to be her <br/>\nfriend, but it doesn&#39;t seem to make any difference.<br/>\nIt may have something to do with dh and I separating because it seems like it <br/>\nstarted during that time.<br/>\nMaybe her confidence will grow and she&#39;ll get over it....I wish I knew what <br/>\ncaused it.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen, who definitely believes life begins at conception and murder is murder <br/>\nbut doesn&#39;t want a debate either.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2953,"nextTopicId":2958}}
