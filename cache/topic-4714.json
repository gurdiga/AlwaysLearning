He&#39;s <br/>\nonline at his friend&#39;s house and says it wouldn&#39;t really be convenient <br/>\nto switch screennames (we have two accounts,and he&#39;s on my main one) <br/>\nright now, so having been jones&#39;n for his list I had to come do it on <br/>\nthe web, which is a mystery to me and I don&#39;t like to learn, y&#39;know.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI could have said &quot;I&#39;m the mom, SCOOT,&quot; but I didn&#39;t.<br/>\nI *could* go make those thinking sticks I need to make, but I have to <br/>\npick Holly and four other kids up at 3:30 and deliver them all home <br/>\nfrom theatre class.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo having the house all to myself, I&#39;m in here squinting around the <br/>\nwebsite when I&#39;m used to doing it by mail.  ***POOR ME***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-For example, I tried to get &quot;Strewing their paths&quot; to match up with <br/>\nmy idea of learning as leading kids to a specific point. So strewing <br/>\nwas like dropping a trail of bread crumbs to lead an animal into a <br/>\ncage.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-But now I see strewing as each strewn bit creating a little path <br/>\ninto the world that my daughter can travel or not, explore thoroughly <br/>\nor just a little. The strewing expands her world rather than leading <br/>\nher any place in particular.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce wrote that.  I hadn&#39;t ever thought of &quot;strewing paths&quot; as bread <br/>\ncrumbs leading to one place.  See how crumbly and scattered my <br/>\nthoughts are?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve had a vision/thought in my head since I was little.  It&#39;s about <br/>\npainting a surface by just dabbing here and there randomly, for a <br/>\nwhile, and then kinda filling in between, and then connecting dots, <br/>\nand eventually having most of it covered and then just filling in the <br/>\nfew holes.  I&#39;ve goofed with it really, on paper, and played with it <br/>\non computers, and never put words to it or discussed it with other <br/>\npeople til now.  Because it seemed stupid, and inefficient, and <br/>\ndisorganized.  I wasn&#39;t interested in the covering of the page, but in <br/>\nthe process, in how &quot;wrong&quot; it was do to it wrong (or whether it was <br/>\nnot wrong, just different).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo maybe that&#39;s the strewing for me.  If the paper was a black screen <br/>\nand on the other side was light, and each new piece of knowledge was a <br/>\npinprick, it would be better to scatter the holes around and make <br/>\npatterns that COULD be connected dot-to-dot than to just start tearing <br/>\nthe screen off from one corner until enough light came through that I <br/>\nthought I could stop.  Or until the screen lost integrity and wasn&#39;t <br/>\nthere anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nDepends if the goal is to get light or get patterns and have fun, I <br/>\nsuppose.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, as seems true, each person has a model of the universe inside his <br/>\nhead, then every single point of information, light or thought <br/>\nenlarges or clarifies or better organizes that internal model.  It <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t help, in my mind, to think of it in so organized a fashion as <br/>\nI must have the whole outline and blueprint before adding details.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I did model trains and was going to work on one big scenario for <br/>\nthe rest of my life, I wouldn&#39;t turn down the opportunity to get a <br/>\nsame-scale miniature truck and sheep because my tracks weren&#39;t <br/>\nfinished.  Every little bit helps.  And if I just FELT like making a <br/>\nstore with little barrels out front, so what if the train switch is <br/>\nbroken?  Eventually it will all come together, or it never will.  But <br/>\nif I deprive myself of painting the mountainside just because it&#39;s not <br/>\nthe trainstation, who benefits?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo perhaps my kind of unschooling works because I have scattershot <br/>\nthinking.  I have LOTS of dots to connect to other dots, and I have <br/>\ndot-to-dot between me and kids, and between me and friends, and the <br/>\ninformation matrix we have among us is pretty big.
