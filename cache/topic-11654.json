The answer is<br/>\nthat if the kids are in school then the mother is free<br/>\nto go back to work in the courts eyes and the more<br/>\nmoney she makes the less she needs to get from her ex.<br/>\n I don&#39;t know about other states but here in<br/>\nWashington the way I understand it is that child<br/>\nsupport gets adjusted when one spouse gets a raise,<br/>\nthe kids aren&#39;t in daycare anymore, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I told my husband that I had found out that the<br/>\ncourts would make him pay alimony for a certain number<br/>\nof years based on how many years we&#39;ve been married<br/>\n(almost 14 now) on top of child support and that this<br/>\nparticular lawyer told me that the courts would not<br/>\nforce me to put the children in school my husband<br/>\nbacked off.  Since the kids and I have been living 150<br/>\nmiles away from my husband except on weekends things<br/>\nhave been obviously better between my husband and I<br/>\nalthough I&#39;ve found it&#39;s very difficult to carry on an<br/>\nargument by email (email is our main source of<br/>\ncommunication during the week) so arguments are rare<br/>\nand we actually enjoy emailing each other.  The hard<br/>\nthing is that my life is like that of a single parent<br/>\nduring the week, with a 9 month old<br/>\nbehavior-challenged boxer puppy and my 2 children 24/7<br/>\nwith no breaks, but most of the time I enjoy it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve definitely tried harder to make our marriage work<br/>\n&quot;for the kids sake&quot; but it takes two to make it work<br/>\nand I&#39;m working on becoming self-sufficient &quot;just in<br/>\ncase&quot;.  One thing I learned from that lawyer is that<br/>\ndivorce is very expensive for both the husband and<br/>\nwife and it sure is better to try to work things out<br/>\nthan go through that.  Hopefully things won&#39;t come to<br/>\nthat with my husband now.<br/>\nCheryl</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1123183,"authorName":"dacunefare@aol.com","from":"dacunefare@...","profile":"undermom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Homeschooling in a divorce situation","postDate":"1042438109","msgId":11686,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI3LjM2NTFjMjI0LjJiNTNiMWRkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":11654,"nextInTopic":11699,"prevInTime":11685,"nextInTime":11687,"topicId":11654,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**This is in response to the note about the laws being different in some states where it actually can and does happen that a judge can make the kids go to ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1927868741\">**This is in response to the note about the laws being<br/>\n<br/>\ndifferent in some states where it actually can and<br/>\n<br/>\ndoes happen that a judge can make the kids go to<br/>\n<br/>\nschool.

They ask that the kids <br/>\nbe sent to school because they&#39;re concerned about them, because they&#39;re not <br/>\ngetting an education, because they&#39;re socially maladroit, etc. etc. etc. And <br/>\ncourts buy into it. There are not enough of us that most judges know enough <br/>\nhomeschooled kids to feel deep down that they know those dads might be wrong. <br/>\nJudges try to rule on what&#39;s best for the children, and to most of America, <br/>\nit&#39;s unquestionable that it&#39;s best for children to go to school. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s a state in the nation where that couldn&#39;t happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":70914754,"authorName":"Cheryl Flohe","from":"Cheryl Flohe &lt;cheryl98178@...&gt;","profile":"cheryl98178","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Homeschooling in a divorce situation","postDate":"1042340873","msgId":11654,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwMTEyMDMwNzUzLjQ3MDU1LnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0NDA4Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNDIyOTcwNTEuMzAwLjQzMjUyLm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":11686,"prevInTime":11653,"nextInTime":11655,"topicId":11654,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is in response to the note about the laws being different in some states where it actually can and does happen that a judge can make the kids go to ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-366796378\">This is in response to the note about the laws being<br/>\ndifferent in some states where it actually can and<br/>\ndoes happen that a judge can make the kids go to<br/>\nschool.

My husband told me a few<br/>\ntimes when things were so bad and we talked about<br/>\ndivorce or when the subject would come up about other<br/>\nfamilies that he thinks child support is completely<br/>\nunfair and feels strongly that in that situation the<br/>\nchildren should be put back in school and the mother<br/>\ngo back to work.  This from a man who went with me to<br/>\nget certified to homeschool and LOVED it, who wants to<br/>\ngo again, who tells people who ask when we will put<br/>\nour kids in school &quot;Never!&quot;.... until he might be<br/>\nforced to pay child support.  Unbelievable....  <br/>\n<br/>\nRight now my husband stays in Seattle while he works<br/>\nat Boeing and comes home on weekends and that works ok<br/>\nfor us right now and hopefully we&#39;re over our bad<br/>\ntimes and things will work fine even if he gets a job<br/>\nover here and lives with us full time.  I have been<br/>\nselling things on ebay and make a little bit of extra<br/>\nmoney but have been looking into other ways to make<br/>\nmoney from home so I can be somewhat self supporting<br/>\nor hopefully totally self supporting if the day ever<br/>\ncomes that I need to be.  I will NEVER put my children<br/>\nback in school unless that&#39;s what they and I decide we<br/>\nwant, which will never be.  This coming from a woman<br/>\nwho raised 2 older children who went all the way<br/>\nthrough school and I never gave a thought to<br/>\nhomeschooling.  I sure love it now though with my 2<br/>\nboys here.  <br/>\nCheryl</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11661,"nextTopicId":11691}}
