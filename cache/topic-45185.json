I expect Seth to be more mature than he s capable of being.  That","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1947112358\">I&#39;ve been thinking about everything everyone has said about this topic and learned this:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. I expect Seth to be more mature than he&#39;s capable of being.  That once he learns how to do something, he can take care of himself.  At some point, the joy I had in helping through diaper changes, getting dressed, feeding, etc. was replaced with a resentment that doing all this was taking me away from things I wanted to do that were &quot;more important.&quot;  I&#39;ve started making his care &quot;we activities&quot; so instead of telling him to go get dressed (and I hear in my voice the same tone/instruction my mother used, gasp) I say, &quot;Let&#39;s go pick out some pants and a shirt to wear!&quot;  So, I&#39;m &quot;babying&quot; him more and in just the last few days that I&#39;ve done this, it&#39;s made an amazing difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I have &quot;bodyspace&quot; issues that I need to work on.  I won&#39;t go into the details, except to say that as a child my own body and personal space was violated often.  So when Seth wants to jump on me, I get very tense, and I don&#39;t like wrestling or playing swords with him.  But small steps to recovery: I sit on a ball at the computer, and he likes to climb up behind me and we bounce on it.  The different suggestions given to help him use up his energy have led me revisit the idea of gymnastics and martial arts classes, and make it a point to go to the park everyday.  <br/>\n<br/>\n3.  I just want to dive in to unschooling, as if it&#39;s as simple as becoming a vegetarian, and I&#39;m doing too much too soon.  So, I&#39;m dialing back attempting too much at a time.  I had recently wanted to tackle bedtime, but I think it&#39;s too much for all of us right now, since we&#39;re still working with food and tv and turning &quot;no&quot; into &quot;yes.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n4.  I realized that instead of presenting Seth with choices, I&#39;m asking him what he wants as if he knows what he wants, and using that sort of question to tell him what I want.  &quot;Do you want to go to the post office with me?&quot;  If that&#39;s where we&#39;re going because we have to, why am I asking him?  Instead I&#39;ve been trying to give him two or three options when I can, and stating things that we&#39;re doing and trying to make them fun, when there are no options.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, we&#39;ve been a lot happier in the last few days.

They don&#39;t have a lot of skills, knowledge or access to answer <br/>\n&quot;yes&quot; for themselves until much later.  When I was a kid about 10 years <br/>\nold (somewhere in that range) since my parents were so big on &quot;no&quot; I <br/>\nlearned never to ask them and I did some pretty danger stupid things <br/>\nthat were beyond my skills and knowledge to handle.  I really could <br/>\nhave gotten killed a few times.  I purposely did stuff far from them <br/>\nbecause I didn&#39;t want to alert them to anything that might turn into <br/>\nanother &quot;no&quot; for me (we lived rurally on 5 acres in the woods).<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not how I want Karl to explore.

He takes gymnastics twice a week and I&#39;m even  looking <br/>\nat 3 times a week. He asks for gymnastics every day. We have a  dome-shaped <br/>\nclimber in the backyard and a trampoline. I wish we had a climbing  tree <br/>\nfor him. We also have a couple things in the house he climbs-he&#39;s just a  <br/>\nclimbing kind of guy the way my oldest is a drawing and video game kind of guy.  <br/>\nWe try to make it to our favorite playgrounds (good climbing and  <br/>\nphysical-challenge type equipment) as often as we can.

I sit and wrap my arms and legs  around him <br/>\ntight and chortle something about him never escaping or getting away  in a <br/>\nmock-evil voice and he struggles *hard* to get loose and wriggle out of my  <br/>\ngrasp.

He&#39;ll keep <br/>\nasking  for it until he&#39;s done and that seems to take care of that large-body <br/>\nmovement  for a while. His brother (10) will do full-body &quot;wrestling&quot; with <br/>\nhim, too, which  helps satisfy that need. I know both of mine have never had <br/>\nany trouble finding  another boy in a play place or playground who like <br/>\nthis big, whole-body type of  play.
