Plus I&#39;m broke. Maybe my <br/>\nMIL will get me one if I ask.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other issue is that I like to give DD lots of choices of what to <br/>\neat, and she is very opinionated. If I give her something she doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwant she sweeps it onto the floor with a very grand dramatic <br/>\ngesture. ;-) So with her in the kitchen I can just reach into the fridge <br/>\nor cabinet and hold things up and she shakes her head yes or no. I don&#39;t <br/>\nreally feel like it&#39;s worth it to make the trip back and forth to the <br/>\nliving room just so she can watch a video. It&#39;s a judgement call on my <br/>\npart.

But <br/>\nshe loves Elmo. She still won&#39;t watch anything else, I try every so <br/>\noften just out of curiosity to see if she will. But even cartoons and <br/>\nother kids&#39; shows do not grab or hold her attention at all. Even the <br/>\nElmo video (which is only like 35-40 minutes long) she will only sit <br/>\nstill -- or stand -- and watch it once through. Then she wants to see it <br/>\nagain and again, but she&#39;ll be mostly playing and listening, and like <br/>\nyou said, looking up now and then. But as soon as it&#39;s over she wants it <br/>\non again.<br/>\n<br/>\nNine times out of ten I say yes. I&#39;m not worried about ADD or what have <br/>\nyou. She has an amazing attention span for such a youngster. She&#39;ll sit <br/>\nand &quot;read&quot; by herself for a long time sometimes. It&#39;s so cute when she <br/>\npicks up a magazine.

But <br/>\nsometimes she gets upset anyway. She&#39;s very small still, and doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhave the level of understanding about emotions and their underlying <br/>\ncauses that your kids have. I wouldn&#39;t say she is short-tempered, just <br/>\nstrong-willed and sensitive.

If she cried for a long time, clearly I <br/>\nwould do whatever I needed to do to comfort her, but she only cries for <br/>\na minute and then is happy again.

I&#39;m sorry if that wasn&#39;t clear in my original post.

I usually just offer a <br/>\nhug if she wants it, but I don&#39;t push myself on her, and I just say, &quot;I <br/>\nunderstand that you&#39;re sad it&#39;s over,&quot; and other sympathetic words in a <br/>\nkind tone, but I don&#39;t try to stop her from crying.<br/>\n<br/>\nDH walked in just as she burst into tears the other day because one <br/>\nended and he started laughing. I totally understood why, it was a really <br/>\ncute cry at the same time as it made me sad to see her so sad. But I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want him getting into the habit of laughing at her every time she <br/>\ngets upset just because it is cute in a way.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe gets over being upset really quickly, sometimes starts laughing and <br/>\nsmiling while the big fat tears are still rolling down her cheeks, lol. <br/>\nBut I just remember my dad being so amused when I would get upset about <br/>\nsomething and that would just make me even more mad and I felt really <br/>\nbelittled. So I told DH to restrain his laughter if he could.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;m not letting him have his feelings, lol. I&#39;m contradicting <br/>\nmyself! I guess it&#39;s okay for him to feel amused, as long as he isn&#39;t so <br/>\nblatant about it that he makes her feel worse.

It can certainly feel personally attacking! I think mostly<br/>\nthough, we just like to read our own brilliantly intelligent responses ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here&#39;s mine, not necessarily directed at your post. I have four children<br/>\nages 15, 14, 12 and 10, so I fully appreciate the &quot;I can&#39;t do it all&quot; times<br/>\nand have left many a child crying simply because there isn&#39;t another arm or<br/>\nhead or thought to offer in the moment. It is a very hard place to be in as<br/>\na mother...especially when we believe that all cries should be answered! I<br/>\nsee now at this point however how it all works out and that children crying<br/>\nis a GOOD thing, and isn&#39;t something to be stopped or pacified, but welcomed<br/>\nand respected as part of the child&#39;s healing. At the end of a tantrum, if<br/>\nallowed or even encouraged to let it all out, I found my kids were so much<br/>\nhappier, calmer and most interesting to me, clearer in their thinking.<br/>\nSometimes though, I didn&#39;t have the attention to give and they just went<br/>\nthrough their thing without my support, but I figured at least I wasn&#39;t<br/>\nshaming or disapproving of them to add to their distress!<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething that can irk me is parents, often with their first child, doing<br/>\nanything and everything in their power to make their child happy, or stop<br/>\ntheir child from crying and tantrumming. It is one of my pet peeves, even<br/>\nthough I know logically that they are doing their best to be the best<br/>\nparents they can be, as we all are. I agree with answering all babies and<br/>\nchildren&#39;s cries with attention, love and support. I don&#39;t do it to stop<br/>\ntheir crying or tantrum however, but to support the healing they are going<br/>\nthrough by crying.

What<br/>\nI said was misconstrued, partly due to my own failings... I was short on<br/>\ntime to begin with and didn&#39;t fill in all of the details. It was unfair for<br/>\nme to share such personal information about my daughter without her<br/>\npermission.  Also it was foolish of me to join your group and just jump<br/>\nright in.<br/>\n<br/>\n      I need to clear up a few things.... I will do this  because I honestly<br/>\nfeel like I am now on the witness stand. Of course I  cuddle my beautiful<br/>\nlittle daughter and quite regularly. Of course she gets extra attention in<br/>\nmany different ways. She gets most of the &#39;turns&#39; next to me in our enormous<br/>\nfamily bed, I hug her, spend time alone with her, help her to pursue her<br/>\ninterests, she was tandem nursed until she was 2 1/2,  I have devoted my<br/>\nefforts, for most of her life to attachment parenting. I am not perfect. It<br/>\nis funny how you get less and less perfect the more kids you have despite<br/>\nefforts to be better.<br/>\n<br/>\n      I am guilty of having  climbed on and off of the wagon over the years-<br/>\nbut the efforts have been truly heart felt and the results meaningful. Other<br/>\nfactors as well... an international move just over a year ago, 5 moves<br/>\nsince. Culture shock. An attempt at primary school- bad experience. Many<br/>\nchanges.<br/>\n<br/>\n      I do not &quot;wait until she is collapsed to take care of her.&quot; But when<br/>\nyou are the parent of 5 closely spaced young children there is alot going<br/>\non. Any respectable triage, must prioritise and act quickly- sometimes kives<br/>\nare in the balance, but everyone gets taken care of. Kids go through things.<br/>\nI believe that that was the topic I was responding to. Sometimes no matter<br/>\nhow much the mother tries, the child still behaves badly, screams and goes<br/>\nthrough difficult changes.<br/>\n<br/>\n      If I have failed to prevent that at any time does that make me an<br/>\ncold, uncaring mother?   Please, do not answer if it is going to be preachy.<br/>\nI am not looking for advice now. I was not requesting advice before.

What I said was misconstrued, partly due to my own failings... I was short on time to begin with and didn&#39;t fill in all of the details. It was unfair for me to share such personal information about my daughter without her permission.  Also it was foolish of me to join your group and just jump right in.  <br/>\n <br/>\n      I need to clear up a few things.... I will do this  because I honestly feel like I am now on the witness stand. Of course I  cuddle my beautiful little daughter and quite regularly. Of course she gets extra attention in many different ways. She gets most of the &#39;turns&#39; next to me in our enormous family bed, I hug her, spend time alone with her, help her to pursue her interests, she was tandem nursed until she was 2 1/2,  I have devoted my efforts, for most of her life to attachment parenting. I am not perfect. It is funny how you get less and less perfect the more kids you have despite efforts to be better. <br/>\n <br/>\n      I am guilty of having  climbed on and off of the wagon over the years- but the efforts have been truly heart felt and the results meaningful. Other factors as well... an international move just over a year ago, 5 moves since. Culture shock. An attempt at primary school- bad experience. Many changes.<br/>\n<br/>\n      I do not &quot;wait until she is collapsed to take care of her.&quot; But when you are the parent of 5 closely spaced young children there is alot going on. Any respectable triage, must prioritise and act quickly- sometimes kives are in the balance, but everyone gets taken care of. Kids go through things.  I believe that that was the topic I was responding to. Sometimes no matter how much the mother tries, the child still behaves badly, screams and goes through difficult changes. <br/>\n<br/>\n      If I have failed to prevent that at any time does that make me an cold, uncaring mother?   Please, do not answer if it is going to be preachy. I am not looking for advice now. I was not requesting advice before. I shared the bit that I did because Moza wanted to know if other 6 y/o&#39;s behaved badly too. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKind regards,<br/>\n<br/>\nCynthia<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 8/19/04 9:12:42 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cynthiaskagen@...\">cynthiaskagen@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; She resists brushing her teeth and refuses to brush her hair.

She has gotten better, but she can start out first thing in the morning","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-64171417\">I have a now 7 year old who has been going through the same thing for more than a year. She has gotten better, but she can start out first thing in the morning terrorizing her still sleeping siblings and if I don&#39;t turn things around immediately this can go on all day long! <br/>\n <br/>\nWe have 5 kids ages 10,8,7,4 and one of them 17 months old. The youngest still breastfeeds and needs to be held and kept out of danger (he is very adventurous) so Parker resents the extra attention he gets. If I say anything kind or positive to anyone else in the family she expects me to immediatey do so with her. I try to talk with her and reassure her that I have enough love to share with everyone and that being kind to someone else in the family doesn&#39;t take anything away from her and that I always love her. She resists brushing her teeth and refuses to brush her hair. She says things like, &quot;Only if you do this or that will I brush my teeth&quot;. I often wonder if I have maybe chosen the wrong job. <br/>\n <br/>\nShe screams and hollers if I talk too much about things. She actually hurts people in the family and seems to enjoy doing it! She bites, scratches, jumps on the backs of other resting children and manipulates the others. From her perspective I am not &quot;cuddling&quot; her enough and I am beside myself when she goes on a bloodthirsty (just kidding) rampage and then falls to the floor in a  heap screaming , &quot;cuddle me!!!!!!&quot;  At this stage I can&#39;t stop to cuddle her. I am too busy tending to the wounds of her victims or clearing away the dangerous wreckage she has left in her wake.  <br/>\nI have actually fantasized about finding a more suitable family for her to grow up in. With other people she can be absolutely sophisticated, upbeat and positive. She can be super helpful and delightful even. They tell me what a lovely person she is.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nThings have gotten much better than they were. We have long stretches in the day when she is &#39;best buddies&#39; with her sisters and she seems content. She does best when I start the morning cuddling her and sometimes reading to her- though she is learning to read and sometimes prefers to read to me. And she is really happy when we spend the day away from home playing, going places, doing things. She is quiet for hours when she does her artwork as she loves this. <br/>\n <br/>\nMaybe I should have instead pursued a career. I certainly lack answers. One thing that seems to work best is creative thinking. When I get as creative with mothering as I would a piece of art or a story, where anything goes, I am met with peace and a happy Parker. <br/>\n <br/>\nAnd here is the thing.... she knows the difference between right and wrong. When we are at the beach or some other place I have often overheard her guiding one of her siblings into making better moral choices! The kids actually have these long philosophical discussions about what you can and can&#39;t do in different parts of the world and what is right or wrong. <br/>\n <br/>\nMoza, I hope my ramblings at least help you to feel that you are not alone. It helps me to share these feelings. I forget that one of the best ways to get through something is to talk about it. I just hold things inside and/or try to work it out with my husband. But we are both sort of feeling our way through these difficult times. I often admire cultures where there is a large extended family to rely on. If one person doesn&#39;t have the answer or the personal quality that is needed for a particular challenge, send in auntie or uncle- they have a way with so and so. Instead, I find that I am having to cultivate useful qualities out of necessity. Often I learn what to do by watching my children who are always learning and always teaching.<br/>\n <br/>\nCynthia<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nAm I just expecting too much? To be able to get along with my 6yo ds <br/>\nwithout feeling that we are against each other all of the time - <br/>\nmost of the time I feel he does things to make me upset. What a <br/>\nhorrible time! I asked him if he is upset with me or if I have done <br/>\nsomething to make him so mad at the slightest thing, if he has a <br/>\nproblem to tell me and perhaps I can help him. Again today I am in <br/>\ntears because I want to be able to &quot;get along&quot; with my son on some <br/>\nsmall level that we are both happy and it&#39;s not happening. Does <br/>\nanyone else have a 6yo or remember them at this age - what is going <br/>\non that I&#39;m not seeing? Of course I&#39;m saying &quot;this age&quot; because I&#39;m <br/>\nhoping that something inside of him is going to develop and work <br/>\nitself out to a better disposition. I just can&#39;t accept that my son <br/>\nhas a nasty disposition - that he wants to continually argue with <br/>\nme, that he wants to hit and yell at me, that he refuses to behave <br/>\nhumanely towards me. I just don&#39;t know how things have gotten this <br/>\nbad, I knew we weren&#39;t perfect but I thought we were working to a <br/>\nmutual level of understanding on some level. <br/>\nWhat I have been trying to do is when he does something that is <br/>\ninappropriate or violent I explain to him why people can&#39;t do that <br/>\nso he can learn a better way to get what he wants. We are radical <br/>\nunschoolers and he has no limits set on him, I try and help him get <br/>\nwhat he wants and needs. We don&#39;t punish, we discuss, or at least I <br/>\ntry to but he prefers to yell, ignore me or hit me. I feel like I am <br/>\nloosing him! Any input would probably be helpful - Thanks - Moza<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

Again today I am in <br/>\ntears because I want to be able to &quot;get along&quot; with my son on some <br/>\nsmall level that we are both happy and it&#39;s not happening. Does <br/>\nanyone else have a 6yo or remember them at this age - what is going <br/>\non that I&#39;m not seeing? Of course I&#39;m saying &quot;this age&quot; because I&#39;m <br/>\nhoping that something inside of him is going to develop and work <br/>\nitself out to a better disposition. I just can&#39;t accept that my son <br/>\nhas a nasty disposition - that he wants to continually argue with <br/>\nme, that he wants to hit and yell at me, that he refuses to behave <br/>\nhumanely towards me. I just don&#39;t know how things have gotten this <br/>\nbad, I knew we weren&#39;t perfect but I thought we were working to a <br/>\nmutual level of understanding on some level. <br/>\n What I have been trying to do is when he does something that is <br/>\ninappropriate or violent I explain to him why people can&#39;t do that <br/>\nso he can learn a better way to get what he wants. We are radical <br/>\nunschoolers and he has no limits set on him, I try and help him get <br/>\nwhat he wants and needs. We don&#39;t punish, we discuss, or at least I <br/>\ntry to but he prefers to yell, ignore me or hit me. I feel like I am <br/>\nloosing him! Any input would probably be helpful - Thanks - Moza</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20390,"nextTopicId":20404}}
