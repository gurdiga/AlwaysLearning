It was NOT a rich learning environment! I found a wonderful, part-time, parent co-op preschool that focused on play and emotional intelligence. It was a few hours a morning, a few times a week. The teachers there had teen children themselves, and each had more than a decade of experience in this particular school. Sky joined late in the year, October I think. We had our first parent-teacher conference in December or January.&nbsp;<br><br>At the meeting, the teacher gave me a helpful review -- her input of Sky&#39;s development as someone who was really trying to see *him* and get to know him as a person. She asked at the end if I had any questions. I did. I was desperate to know how to make him stop lying and stealing things that I told him were &quot;mine&quot;. My markers, my contact solution, the q-tips in my bathroom, tampons! It seems comical now, to think about how much I was getting in my own way by both being too far away and simultaneously trying to control every detail in our home.&nbsp;<br><br>The teacher smiled patiently, then said carefully, &quot;Every behavior has a function.&quot;&nbsp;<br><br>While this moment had nothing to do with unschooling, it was pivotal for my relationship with my child. It gave me the approval from an elder that I needed, to see my role as his mother differently. She gave me permission to stop trying to make him understand me and instead to keep trying to understand him. <br><br>When he was a baby, I didn&#39;t take any of his behavior personally. I looked for cues, I assumed he knew something that I didn&#39;t know and that it was my job to understand. But in toddlerhood, I started to have shame around some of his behaviors. I was so concerned with getting the behaviors to stop -- and stop reflecting poorly on me --&nbsp; that my priorities got jumbled up. My parenting had become very much a performance for the Gaze of others rather than a path to intimacy and peace with my child.&nbsp;<br><br>The paradigm shift that occurred when I understood her words to me handed my curiosity back to me. With it came trust, that I could follow his lead and we&#39;d be ok. That moment primed me for unschooling.&nbsp;<br><br>Tara Joe Farrell</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":403767111,"authorName":"Jo Isaac","from":"Jo Isaac &lt;joanneisaac@...&gt;","profile":"joanne.isaac","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Who helped you &quot;get&quot; unschooling?","postDate":"1557295898","msgId":78579,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERCNlAxODlNQjA1MjBGODVBRDhGMTEwQ0Q3RTQ3MDI1MkI3MzIwQERCNlAxODlNQjA1MjAuRVVSUDE4OS5QUk9ELk9VVExPT0suQ09NPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDg5QzQzRDI4LURFMDEtNDI4Ni1BQURELTRFMzZCM0MzRjZGNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDg5QzQzRDI4LURFMDEtNDI4Ni1BQURELTRFMzZCM0MzRjZGNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":78576,"nextInTopic":78580,"prevInTime":78578,"nextInTime":78580,"topicId":78575,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I went to the link, to see if my story was already there (didn t want to repeat it, if it was!) but I can t go to the page - seems the link is wrong?
