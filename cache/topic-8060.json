We started out<br/>\nunschooling.  A strange turn of events involving bitter family members and<br/>\nsocial services made me lose my mind &lt;g&gt; and I began &quot;school at home&quot;<br/>\npractices after only 1 year unschooling.  I have flipped back and forth over<br/>\nthe years.  We are back to unschooling now, to stay, forever.  This time<br/>\nfeels different for us. For this and many other changes I thank all the<br/>\nposters on this and other unschooly lists, message boards, and web page<br/>\narticles.  My family is happier now.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe currently live in central Indiana.  I&#39;ve lived in many places (Alaska,<br/>\nTexas, North Carolina, Illinois, Michigan, Nebraska, Indiana) and attended<br/>\n12 different public schools in my youth.  (Yes, I am still recovering from<br/>\nthat) LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that&#39;s all for now.... :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nZan<br/>\n<br/>\nThis message is cross-posted to other lists, sorry if you have to read it<br/>\ntwice :-(<br/>\n__________________________________________________________________<br/>\nZan Hawk<br/>\nICQ#: 811555</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8058,"nextTopicId":8049}}
