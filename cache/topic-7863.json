The<br/>\noften successful attempts to turn the written word<br/>\ninto drudgery just burn me up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am with you Jane.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was the proverbial Teacher&#39;s Pet until Middle<br/>\nSchool, when I realized the whole scraping and bowing<br/>\ndown deal wasn&#39;t for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, the grade depended on whether or not I enjoyed<br/>\nthe subject matter.  I could always manage A&#39;s with<br/>\nlittle study time,(public school), and seemed to be<br/>\nable to get a C just by showing up and doing the<br/>\nin-class stuff.  I was Lucky, it was always easy for<br/>\nme.  Though it wasn&#39;t very nurturing, at least I<br/>\nwasn&#39;t Tortured by the &quot;failure&quot; label as so many are.<br/>\n<br/>\nI managed to get the &quot;3.5&quot; formula down well enough to<br/>\nCLEP out of the first year of college English.  But, <br/>\nthe lasting impact of having my high school work<br/>\nmeaninglessly criticized lead me to actually alter my<br/>\nexact course of study as to avoid having to write<br/>\nResearch papers.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy senior year high school English teacher was an<br/>\nex-nun. We had to write on Hamlet and I chose to come<br/>\nat it from a Feminist point of view.   How did their<br/>\nview of their own power/lack thereof effect the<br/>\noutcomes, etc...........<br/>\n<br/>\nThat idiot teacher could do no better than mark up my<br/>\npaper for &quot;incorrect sentence structure&quot;.  Makes you<br/>\nwonder if any of these teachers actually consider the<br/>\nmerits of REAL Literature, with all it&#39;s rule breaking<br/>\nand original perspective.  Or, do they actually Enjoy<br/>\nthe crap examples in grammar text books?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has taken me many years to see it for the<br/>\ninconsequential pursuit that it is.  Making grades and<br/>\nappeasing the nonsensical standards of the modern day<br/>\nclassroom is beyond useless.  It&#39;s character damaging.<br/>\n It&#39;s soul shrinking. If addressed specifically, much<br/>\nof it ought to be found Criminal as it certainly<br/>\nillustrates cruel and unusual punishment for so many.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of what infuriates me is what it steals form us<br/>\nall: Joyful Readers,  Curious Thinkers, Inspired<br/>\nWriters.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am now 11 years away from formal education.  I have<br/>\njust begun writing for pleasure.  It is a talent that<br/>\nI am only now beginning to explore developing.  I am<br/>\n37 years old.  How far behind has all that coerced<br/>\ncomposition put me?  I will never be able to answer<br/>\nthat.  But I am certain that the passion I have for<br/>\nthe written word was long delayed due to those years<br/>\nof forced writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nShame on them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can the goal of institutionalized coercive<br/>\neducation be seen as anything short of diminishing<br/>\nhumanity.  Controlling thought.  Creating a submissive<br/>\npopulace. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe results are Undeniable.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Melinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsutfran@...\">jsutfran@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Interesting essay - vent<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; HI all -<br/>\n&gt; Thanks Pam for passing along that essay....it<br/>\n&gt; stirred up a long ago <br/>\n&gt; hurt....In 5th grade we had to write an essay about<br/>\n&gt; a voyage across the <br/>\n&gt; ocean....like a 13 yo boy who signed on to work on a<br/>\n&gt; ship for his passage to <br/>\n&gt; the new country or something....I started the essay<br/>\n&gt; like this:  (can you <br/>\n&gt; believe I can still remember it!!)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot; I don&#39; t know why I did it, but I did.  I signed<br/>\n&gt; up to work on the xxxx <br/>\n&gt; ship so that I can get to America.&quot;  (something in<br/>\n&gt; there about being afraid <br/>\n&gt; too)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I felt very creative starting it out like a journal<br/>\n&gt; entry.....I was pretty <br/>\n&gt; thrilled with my idea.....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My favorite teacher of all time SQUASHED it!  Told<br/>\n&gt; me that it was not <br/>\n&gt; appropriate.....totally shocked me with her red pen<br/>\n&gt; editing and criticizing <br/>\n&gt; my creativity!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Later that year, she used one of my writing samples<br/>\n&gt; on an overhead to point <br/>\n&gt; out errors.....she didn&#39;t show my name but I was<br/>\n&gt; horrified.....here I was <br/>\n&gt; walking around thinking I knew something about<br/>\n&gt; writing!   I read A LOT and I <br/>\n&gt; remember specifically that I was playing with a<br/>\n&gt; style that I had noticed in a <br/>\n&gt; book....ugh!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Into college, I felt unsure of my writing<br/>\n&gt; ability.....taking risks with my <br/>\n&gt; writing became very difficult and I mostly stayed on<br/>\n&gt; the safe side in high <br/>\n&gt; school.....my parents use a different language so I<br/>\n&gt; felt that I was <br/>\n&gt; rightfully unsure since I was using a &#39;second<br/>\n&gt; language&#39; so if others thought <br/>\n&gt; my writing wasn&#39;t good, it probably isn&#39;t....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; even now, I feel that I should edit what I post.....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ugh.....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; and then there are all those formulas for poetry,<br/>\n&gt; too....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; okay, nuff venting!  thanks for listening!<br/>\n&gt; Jane<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====<br/>\n: D  Melinda<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
