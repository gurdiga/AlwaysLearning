I hear non-unschooling people say things like how they&#39;d love to unschool but their child (or actually maybe the parent but they don&#39;t admit it to me) require more structure than that so they can&#39;t. I don&#39;t think the two are in opposition or that only people with &quot;Type B&quot; personalities can unschool successfully. (And I&#39;m not saying you said that either, only that my thoughts went this direction.)<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of trying to make myself someone I&#39;m not, I&#39;m enjoying experimenting. I&#39;ve gained a new understanding that it&#39;s ok that I feel preferences strongly, and  that I like to know what&#39;s happening next or even a week from now and how I might handle it. But I&#39;m also learning how to ask for, not demand, what I prefer, and what I can give up. I&#39;m learning my children&#39;s personalities and preferences and how to value them. It&#39;s been quite a process, maybe more difficult for me at times than someone with a more relaxed personality, but I have a relationship with my children now that I never even imagined would be possible when we first started.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren W.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-But even in a family, policies can serve the family and not rule the family.

Policies have some flexibility but I do not find them very helpful in familiar relationships. The purpose of a policy is to establish how one should behave in certain situations.

Here is a link on expectations: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/expectations\">http://sandradodd.com/expectations</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nAs you said, a policy is a short cut. In unschooling, I donâ€™t think short cuts are helpful because they may lead one to miss small nuances that can potentially have a huge impact on how to handle situations as they arise.

I was thinking a &quot;policy&quot; was simply an understanding you arrive at before hand about how you&#39;re going to handle something in the future. Maybe that&#39;s too broad a definition? If it is a working definition, then a policy doesn&#39;t have to be at odds with relationship, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis doesn&#39;t have much connection to the particular policy in the previous conversation. I&#39;m thinking about this because I&#39;m currently editing and adding to a policy manual for a co-op my kids want to participate in this fall. A policy, discussed and agreed upon ahead of time, can be a good short-cut so a situation is not a brand new conversation in the future (and many of the co-op policies are to cover our legal butts). But even in a family, policies can serve the family and not rule the family. Is this a good way to look at it? Or are there still difficulties?<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder about these things because I like order, organization, structure, etc... but I also love the openness of unschooling and prioritizing relationships, so I&#39;m trying to work out what it looks like to embrace both in the context of the family I&#39;ve got.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nKaren W.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Jul 15, 2012, at 8:42 PM, michelle_mcritchie wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; We&#39;ve always had an open policy to internet stuff eg. we have her password to email<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rather than a policy, it&#39;s more relationship building to ask.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What&#39;s the purpose of the policy that asking permission wouldn&#39;t also accomplish?

Â It has its place in life and while I don&#39;t entirely get the draw to it, I see interesting things in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that is what your daughter is interested in and drawn to, it might be more useful to openly find out why she is interested in it. Â What does she see in it, not what you think she sees in it, but what she actually sees in it?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my own daughter explored it, it had more to do with anime, manga, and horror movies, combined with fashion and art, than it did with any kind of attitude. Â She LIKES blood and gore and dark and scary. Â For a couple of years she felt entirely out of place liking these things while other kids her age liked Disney. Â The internet helped enormously for her to find others who liked similar things. Â It became easier and easier for her to spot the people like her, over the people who were super depressed and suicidal, or the people who wanted that kind of attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe did manage to find a hotbed of like minded others working in haunted house productions. Â In and among all the people she&#39;s met and people she&#39;s known, she has been very careful about who she allows into her inner circle and who she keeps at bay. Â She knows a lot of really messed up young people. Â Some of them cut themselves. Â Cutting is pretty addictive. Â One time my daughter was very depressed over some really yucky circumstances beyond our control and she tried cutting. Â That was all it took for her to realize that self harm hurt worse than feeling the depression and working hard to get out of it. Â It wasn&#39;t the physical pain of cutting that hurt, it was the emotional pain of harming herself that hurt. Â There is no way in the world I could have explained that to her better than she experienced it for herself. Â It was a truly pivotal moment for her, one that catapulted her into finding ways to deal with mood swings and life blows and<br/>\n helping others do the same, in healthy and proactive ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nControlling the internet usage might cause the very things you hope to avoid, sneaky behavior and hiding emotional health from the very people that should be her safety net. Â If something made me uncomfortable it helped for me to NOT over react. Â It helped for me to first find what made me uncomfortable about the situation, then when I was clear, ask questions of my daughter to gain her perspective. Â 95% of the time, what I was uncomfortable about wasn&#39;t even at play or at the heart of what my daughter was experiencing. Â If I had gone first with my assumptions and reacting to those things, I likely would have come across as some crazy nutter to my daughter.Â <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI absolutely NEVER ever ever ever intruded on her privacy if she requested it. Â When I cleaned her room for her, I never read notes or computer messages of any kind, EVER. Â Since she knew that and trusted me, she shared most of everything with me, sometimes more than I cared to know! Â It is still that way and I&#39;m very glad that she can have privacy when she wants it and needs it. Â Privacy is so important!<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Teens, their online worlds & parental responses, Self harm mentioned - sensitive","postDate":"1342460018","msgId":68180,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNDI0NjAwMTguNzAxOTkuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyMjUwNC5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGp0dm8xOCsxMDBpdUBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGp0dXZnOSsyZTQ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8anR2bzE4KzEwMGl1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68177,"nextInTopic":68185,"prevInTime":68179,"nextInTime":68181,"topicId":68155,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***2 days ago we had a big incident here with a boy who visited and my son walking in on her kissing this boy (they are not in any relationship and the boy is","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-535998213\">***2 days ago we had a big incident here with a boy who visited and my son walking in on her kissing this boy (they are not in any relationship and the boy is 17 yrs)Â ***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first thought is that you way over reacted to your daughter kissing. Â Kissing isn&#39;t a big incident, more of a cool milestone of sweetness and entering into the teen age in a very normal way. Â If you are concerned about age differences, address that directly to both of them. Â I think you said your daughter is 14. Â I had my first kiss at that age. Â I also have known many kids who were sexually active at that age, even when I was that age.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as open door policies on internet or anything else, if there is a need for privacy, the need doesn&#39;t go away. Â Your daughter found a way to keep you out of the loop, circumventing that policy in a sneaky way. Â Why set yourself up for that? Â If she wants to share with you, she will do so willingly. Â If she doesn&#39;t she won&#39;t and if you force it, you&#39;ve lost the totally awesomeness of her openly sharing with you. Â It truly does happen but you really can&#39;t force it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would not have read her tumblr if she had requested that you not. Â If she is hiding things from you, then you need to work on making your relationship more open. Â If you want an open door policy, it should mean YOUR door is always open not hers.

Anyway tumblr is new for her and she was telling me lots about it, sitting next to me on the couch and sharing some funny stuff on there BUT when I asked to look at it she gave me an over the top reaction of &quot;No Mum please don&#39;t ever join up and please don&#39;t go looking for me as you won&#39;t find me&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\n2 days ago we had a big incident here with a boy who visited and my son walking in on her kissing this boy (they are not in any relationship and the boy is 17 yrs), so that bought up heaps of issues and was a HUGE challenge to my new parenting approach of respect, unconditional love, trust etc.  My first reaction wasn&#39;t great but I quickly asked for a &#39;rewrite&#39; and then also asked her to give me some time to process it (my husband was away and usually this is the way I process stuff).  That night I encouraged her to stay off technology (after calling my hubby for advice) and she gave me her laptop and itouch.  I had a look at her laptop (again we have an open policy which I have not officially changed although I am still unsure about this now and think I need to think this policy through - but no firm ideas now) and I clicked on her tumblr and read it.  I knew she had asked me not to but at this point I was so worried about her that I just went with my old instincts.  I didn&#39;t say anything to her the next day but I noticed the information I knew about the page made me more angry at her and disconnected us even more as I felt like she was a stranger.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was only last night when we sat down and chatted to her that I told her I read her tumblr.

She quickly mentioned tumblr being not a good thing for her and being a very negative space (well one of her tumblr accounts, she has another which is full of anime and manga stuff but that is positive for her).  She then mentioned deleting her account (for the negative one) and all I said is &quot;Well that is your decision, but if you feel it&#39;s not being helpful for your current state of mind then yes I agree it&#39;s probably a good decision&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe quickly got her laptop and sat next to me and deleted her account.  We then had a chat for the next hour or more just about life in general and what she is struggling with (not having like minded friends and feeling like she is unsure of who she is).  We talked about the struggles and asked her how we can support her better and build her trust so she comes to us when she is feeling down.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve also discussed the cutting, suicide subjects on her blog with my hubby&#39;s help (he was amazing, so gentle and non judgemental), so we feel we are okay with what that&#39;s all about.  My husband has also talked about spending some more one on one time with her and I will also make an effort to stay more connected with her instead of leaving her sometimes for hours without checking in (so hard to get the balance when at that age they do say they want time alone).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway we feel this has been a huge opportunity for growth for all of us and a chance to show her a different approach instead of taking the decision making out of her hands and giving her the message that we don&#39;t trust her or that she&#39;s not capable of making wise decisions on her own.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much for hearing me out,<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think the first thing I would say is &quot;I&#39;m worried about this&quot; and ask for reassurance that she&#39;s safe and okay.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-I am concerned that all the negativity is affecting her mood.-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; All that negativity IS her mood, isn&#39;t it?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/negativity\">http://sandradodd.com/negativity</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe you&#39;ll find something there that will help you think about it, or something you could share with her either directly or indirectly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Teens, their online worlds & parental responses, Self harm mentioned - sensitive","postDate":"1342325873","msgId":68160,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlBRDk4N0FDLUZCNTMtNDAzMy04QjZCLTJGMTQ0RDU3RUU1RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGp0dDIxcitkMHNhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGp0dDIxcitkMHNhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68156,"nextInTopic":68167,"prevInTime":68159,"nextInTime":68161,"topicId":68155,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think the first thing I would say is I m worried about this and ask for reassurance that she s safe and okay. -=-I am concerned that all the negativity is","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1426339572\">I think the first thing I would say is &quot;I&#39;m worried about this&quot; and ask for reassurance that she&#39;s safe and okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I am concerned that all the negativity is affecting her mood.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that negativity IS her mood, isn&#39;t it?<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/negativity\">http://sandradodd.com/negativity</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you&#39;ll find something there that will help you think about it, or something you could share with her either directly or indirectly.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Teens, their online worlds & parental responses, Self harm mentioned - sensitive","postDate":"1342315619","msgId":68156,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNDIzMTU2MTkuOTM1MTQuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTA4Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGp0dDIxcitkMHNhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGp0dDIxcitkMHNhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68155,"nextInTopic":68160,"prevInTime":68155,"nextInTime":68157,"topicId":68155,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I can t tell you if she really feels the way you are describing she writes on her blog.Â  My son has an alter ego online in Len Kagamine, a vocaloid.

The last two weeks I have noticed she&#39;s been extra &#39;grumpy&#39; and getting up very late in the day, but with our new approach I have been letting her go but just talking gently to her about her moods and how they affect others in the household.  She has always been quite outspoken in her peer group about not giving into society&#39;s pressures about weight, very negative about the increase in the self harm act of &#39;cutting&#39; (but supportive of friends who do it and even asked her dad how she can help as my husband works in youth mental health).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the last day I found out she has a tumblr blog in which is full of pictures of very depressing stuff, photos of self harm (not herself), words of suicide, negative body image statements etc.  Anyway the blog is worlds away from how I see her and how she travels in the world (and we are pretty connected parents and switched on as we both world in counselling type fields).  I know she has struggled with friends, finding someone she can really relate to so my assumption (and I could be wrong) is that she&#39;s trying to connect with one of her good friends by trying to portray a similar life.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway my main question is what to do with her &#39;online world&#39;, my old parenting style (before radical unschooling) would have been to tell her to delete her tumblr account and take control ... but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a good approach now.  I definitely will talk to her about my feelings when I read it and ask her what she get&#39;s out of it and how it doesn&#39;t add up with what we see in real life but I am concerned that all the negativity is affecting her mood.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it&#39;s hard to comment when you don&#39;t have the full picture, not so much needing advice on the possible mental health issues (hubby and I feel confident in that area), but just not sure how to approach the tumblr blog with not taking over control etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for such a &#39;heavy&#39; first message!<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68232,"nextTopicId":9853}}
