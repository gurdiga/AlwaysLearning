For<br/>\nparents, teaching means instilling knowledge from the outside into the<br/>\nchild. The same is true for a child who has been a student either at home or<br/>\nschool. For them, learning is a much better word for getting the concepts of<br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a child who has never been to school and has never been a student at<br/>\nhome, teaching probably means being mentored and having a choice as to when<br/>\nto start or stop going to the mentor for information.
