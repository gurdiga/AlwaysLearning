I&#39;m having trouble<br/>\narticulating this so forgive me if this doesn&#39;t come<br/>\nout right.  We DO often need the labels or signopsts<br/>\nfor understanding sometimes.  Thinking in greys and<br/>\nabstracts doesn&#39;t come easily.  Everything is<br/>\nspecifically defined, to minute detail like the koala<br/>\nwith his leaves, and needs to be specifically defined<br/>\nfor understanding.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance learning facial recognition of what<br/>\n&quot;angry&quot; looks like often doesn&#39;t translate to<br/>\ndifferent people.  &quot;OK, now I know and have catalogued<br/>\nwhat Jane&#39;s angry face looks like for future reference<br/>\nin interacting with Jane.  I don&#39;t know what Barry or<br/>\nBill or Betty&#39;s angry faces look like though.  I will<br/>\nhave to learn this in order to porperly interact with<br/>\nthem.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThese specifics are present in everything.  A<br/>\nsensativity above and beyond most people&#39;s<br/>\nsensativities and distinctions to things like sensory,<br/>\nemotional or other input.  For me most movies feel<br/>\nlike they are beating me about the head and bosy with<br/>\nemotion.  Understated is best and gives me as much of<br/>\nan emotional punch impact as something more heavy<br/>\nhanded for other folks.  I can&#39;t watch most of mel<br/>\nGibson&#39;s stuff (Braveheart, Passion of Christ,<br/>\nPartiot) because it&#39;s just far, far too strong for me<br/>\nand I am not only sobbing or very disturbed just a<br/>\nshort way into the film but am also emotionally<br/>\ndisturbed, off balance, nightmaring, etc, for days or<br/>\nweeks afterwards, with amorphous non-specific panic<br/>\nand anxiety when awake.  That&#39;s not entertaining or<br/>\nfun by any stretch of the imagination, no matter how<br/>\ngifted an actor/director he might be.<br/>\n<br/>\nIronically this inability to turn off or tone down<br/>\nsensory or emotional inputs is coupled with an<br/>\ninability to see or dectect subtleties in other areas.<br/>\n It&#39;s often contradicotry, unpredictable and<br/>\nfrustrating.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in that way there are almost no &quot;generalizations&quot;<br/>\nhappening at all inside autistics, even in something<br/>\nas common as reading emotion on different faces.  This<br/>\nmakes navigating something like the party example you<br/>\nused really hard, coupled with the overstimulation.  I<br/>\nimagined myself in your place, trying to watch my<br/>\nhusband for signs of discomfort and his needing to<br/>\nleave and I could not imagine being able to do that. <br/>\nI can&#39;t even hear him talking to me when the kids are<br/>\nplaying in the room at a normal kid volume, and have<br/>\nto either ask them to be quiet for a minute or leave<br/>\nthe room with him myself in order to hear what he&#39;s<br/>\nsaying.  I can&#39;t imagine remembering and enacting a<br/>\nreading of his face during a busy social gathering.  I<br/>\ncan&#39;t imagine him being able to do something like that<br/>\neither.  Instead what we do is have a tacit agreement<br/>\nin our family to say outright what we need to the<br/>\nother person(s).  In fact he asked me to do this when<br/>\nwe were first starting to date and I was relieved that<br/>\nhe had the same problems I do in that area and so<br/>\nunderstood me better for it.  So if he was feeling<br/>\ntired and needing to go he would pull me aside and let<br/>\nme know.  Same with our kids, or myself to them,<br/>\nalthough we do try to watch the kids more and let them<br/>\nknow what they seem to be expressing because they<br/>\ndon&#39;t recognize or understand their own feelings or<br/>\nneeds often.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23850,"nextTopicId":23845}}
