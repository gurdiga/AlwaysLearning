I would consider it a fairly crowded field.

Honestly I would avoid the &quot;How to do this for <br/>\ntiny money&quot; books, at least at first, because although there are occasional <br/>\nsuccess stories, most people&#39;s micro budget film is never seen by anyone. <br/>\nDoing things on the micro cheap is always a long tale of compromise and will <br/>\nbe telling you how to get around the conventions and proper protocols, <br/>\ninstead of explaining why they are in place. There is not one single <br/>\nproducer who, if given the real choice, would not choose a bigger budget - <br/>\nand this is at any budget level!<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of the books are biographies or memoirs of noted film makers - <br/>\nproducers, directors - if you see a name you like or recognize those would <br/>\nbe good.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the &quot;how to&quot; books, actually I was looking for the title of a <br/>\nreallygood basic little book that detailed the different jobs I found useful <br/>\nsome years ago, but in doing so I found a newer one aimed at kids in comic <br/>\nformat, that I rather like the look of: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/5yn4y3\">http://tinyurl.com/5yn4y3</a>  &quot;Lights, <br/>\nCamera, Action&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther really useful insiders&#39; sources are the journals from the unions. If <br/>\nyou google IATSE you will get a link to the main alliance, but also scroll <br/>\ndown to the locals. Moving past the politcal articles, there are often <br/>\narticles dealing with specific issues written by people working in the <br/>\nbusiness. The Location Managers journal is a good one. If you have a Local <br/>\nin your town you might be able to visit it and talk to some people. If you <br/>\nhave a movie shooting locally you might try to visit - call the production <br/>\noffice first - or find out if they are casting local extras. People were <br/>\nflocking to the Ren Faire that James&#39; movie is using as a location. It <br/>\nstayed open an extra week.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe letters that appear after the names of crew members in the credits are <br/>\nprofessional societies. For instance, James is a member of the Cinema Audio <br/>\nSociety. They all publish journals. Cinefex, the FX folks journal is a <br/>\ngorgeous publication, and is usually on the magazine rack in the big chain <br/>\nbookstores.<br/>\n<br/>\nTurner Classic Movies has guests that come and talk about their lives and <br/>\nprocesses. FOX Movie Channel has a series called &quot;Life After Film School&quot; <br/>\nwhere currently working directors and producers are interviewed by a panel <br/>\nof current film school students about their process.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a few home movie editing software suites around. I will leave it <br/>\nto someone experienced with them to make recommendations. We have a regular <br/>\nold video cam, and a tiny hand held video cam that holds 30 minutes before <br/>\nyou have to upload the film to the computer. Jayn has used both with a lot <br/>\nof fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me know if you are ever in Los Angeles.
