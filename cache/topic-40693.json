Children allowed to learn on their own timetable do learn to  <br/>\nread at widely divergent times�there is NO right time for all  <br/>\nchildren. Some learn to read at three years old and others at 12 or  <br/>\neven older. It doesn&#39;t matter. Children who are not yet reading are  <br/>\nSTILL learning�support their learning in their own way. Pushing  <br/>\nchildren to try to learn to read before they are developmentally  <br/>\nready is probably a major cause of long-term antipathy toward  <br/>\nreading, at best, and reading disabilities, at worst.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40692,"nextTopicId":40694}}
