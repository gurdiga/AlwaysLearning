For me it would be a place that didn&#39;t need guns and did not have violence. Maybe not very realistic but I was trying to think of a place like that on earth. I asked him what he meant by &quot;safe&quot;.  He explain that he wanted to know if there was such a place that was completely secure in a military sense.  Who has the best defense, the most weapons to use against the enemy, the biggest army, etc. Safe for him involved many things that do not really make me feel safe and home has not always been safe in my life. So &quot;Safe&quot; conjured up three different images for three different people.
