Eating.  We have a long ugly history with eating in this house when it comes to my son.  He was born in renal failure and on dialysis by the time he was 7 months.  You aren&#39;t hungry when your body is toxic so he missed out on that wonderful time when babies start trying cereal and rice and smooshed up fruits and veggies.  He had a g-tube placed to get his calories and didn&#39;t eat a single bite of food for over two years when he got his transplant.  Then we started therapy for his oral aversion.  If I could take it back I would because I really feel in my heart of hearts that what we learned to do in therapy made things worse.  Fast forward to present day (he&#39;s 9 now) and he is still getting more than half his calories through his g-tube.  Improvements have been made but they have been painfully slow.  It&#39;s been six years since his transplant and I think food to him is something that is scary and something to control.  Today we went to Fresh Choice and he picked pickles, olives, shredded cheese and Dr. Pepper and not a lot of it either.  Oh and bread.  I asked him if we could go through the line again and pick some things he had never tried before and if he didn&#39;t like them he could spit them out.  My little guy.  He went through the line and made a grand effort.  He picked Chinese chicken salad, rotini noodles, carrots, cucumber and broccoli salad.  We went and sat back down and he tried everything on his plate.  First the noodles.  He gagged and spit them out.  Then the cucumbers and carrots which he didn&#39;t gag on but didn&#39;t like. The chicken salad he was able to distinguish what was chicken and what was cabbage and picked the cabbage out and then broccoli salad which almost made him vomit.  It was very disheartening to see him try and have a physical reaction to the food.  I tried to hide it but he knew I was disappointed and I feel like a freaking jerk for it.  I told him I wasn&#39;t disappointed in him that I was so proud that he even tried.   He tried his best, no doubt to try to please me, to try something new and he just couldn&#39;t do it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my question is how do I help him to get over food is scary?   How do I undo the damage?  How do I turn my thinking so it&#39;s not so scary for me to look at him and his lack of eating and not be fearful?  I&#39;ve told myself I am just going to sit on my hands and shut my mouth and let him eat whatever he does but when he doesn&#39;t eat dinner at all or only eats a bite and proclaims he is full my worry-o-meter shoots way up and I don&#39;t know how to balance being happy with the way he eats and my desire to make sure he eats well and really in the end gets rid of his g-tube.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Food","postDate":"1241365015","msgId":44656,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBMDVCMTEwLTM1MDUtNDYwRi1CRDU0LUM2MjY0QjA5QUFDQ0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGMyNy41ZDQ1ZjgyMC4zNzJlNzQ5MEBhb2wuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGMyNy41ZDQ1ZjgyMC4zNzJlNzQ5MEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44655,"nextInTopic":57758,"prevInTime":44655,"nextInTime":44657,"topicId":8482,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t have any fears of sugar. I eat sugar cubes straight. Sometimes I just want that pure sugar taste. I can remember as a child filling a bowl with powdered sugar and just eating it. It was so lovely. But I wasn&#39;t addicted. It may have produced a serotonin response, it may have made me feel happier, but that didn&#39;t make me addicted to sugar. I just like it, sometimes, so I have it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking about what the worst that could happen to you if you allowed yourself sugar, if you didn&#39;t see it as something that was controlling you and so you brought it into your home and made it easily accessible. You could eat a lot of sugar, maybe you&#39;d get heavier, maybe you wouldn&#39;t, but I&#39;m imagining worst case scenerios. You might get cavities, but that&#39;s only going to happen if you have the cavity producing bacteria, and as adults tend to have fewer of those bacteria, it&#39;s probably not going to change anything. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo those were the scariest things that I could come up with. You could get fat, you might get a few more cavities, but probably not. What would you gain, though, if you overcame your fear of sugar? What would you gain if you got to a point, like Kelly Lovejoy who loved, loved, loved M&Ms and would eat them to gone as soon as they came in the house and then one day just gave herself permission and bought a bunch of bags of M&Ms and ate and ate and refilled bowl after bowl until she was done? Now the M&Ms don&#39;t go very quickly in the Lovejoy&#39;s house. You&#39;d gain a world of food choices back. You wouldn&#39;t see food as something to be afraid of.  You wouldn&#39;t be susceptible to stories about addiction to things like food or video games or television &#39;cause you&#39;d lived through your own fears, you&#39;d walked to the other side. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy favorite examination of addiction is the work Bruce Alexander has done starting with Rat Park.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2007.12-health-rat-trap/%c2%a0is\">http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2007.12-health-rat-trap/%c2%a0is</a> a good place to read about it. Maybe it will give you a different perspective on addiction. And maybe a change in perspective will help you to see how you can be strong enough to keep your son&#39;s world of food rich and varied and flavored with sugar, when he wants it so.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Maria &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:maria.veltman@...\">maria.veltman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSo...the question I have has to do with sweets.  We don&#39;t have many in our house because I&#39;m a recovering sugar addict (to sucrose, high fructose corn syrup).  In the same way an alcoholic is addicted to alcohol.  If it is in the house, I will consume it.  If I know it&#39;s in the cupboard, it&#39;s all I can think about, and usually, I&#39;ll eat it all in on sitting and then go out for more (downward spiral).  If it belongs to someone else, I will try not to eat it, but it&#39;s very difficult (it&#39;s amazing what justifications one can come up with).  The result is that I become very agitated, anxious, angry, controlling, out of control when I have it (depends on what I&#39;m eating, some things are worse than others).  I also have done some reading on sugar (primarily sucrose) that has led me to understand that it&#39;s not really a food but acts more like a drug, and I want to protect him from that (much in the same I protect him from illicit drugs, multiple/early<br/>\n vaccines, etc).  But I also know that some people can handle sweets better (just like all people don&#39;t become alcoholics).  I would like Seth to be able to enjoy the sweet treats he wants/likes and I don&#39;t want to be a Nazi about it because I don&#39;t want him to develop eating issues.  I also want him to eat or not eat things based on what he knows about them, but I don&#39;t know that he&#39;s old enough to understand the hows and whys (of Red #40, for instance).  So, is it unreasonable for me to not get the things he likes because I can&#39;t handle myself?  Am I not seeing another solution here?  Or am I making a mountain out of a molehill?  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaria  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Food","postDate":"1241266804","msgId":44619,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM0QkUxRTQyLUNDRUItNDYxNC04OEFELUZGMzMzREE0RDA1MkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGd0ZmdmcSs1Zjk4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGd0ZmdmcSs1Zjk4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44615,"nextInTopic":44626,"prevInTime":44618,"nextInTime":44620,"topicId":8482,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I was reading some articles on Joyfully Rejoycing and I have really been trying to allow Seth, who s 3.5, to choose when, what and where to eat. -=- Instead","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-258695370\">-=-I was reading some articles on Joyfully Rejoycing and I have really  <br/>\nbeen trying to allow Seth, who&#39;s 3.5, to choose when, what and where  <br/>\nto eat. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of that, it might have been better to just stop trying to  <br/>\n&quot;make him&quot; finish his food.

One day I told them I was tired of their complaining and my feeling like a servant and I told them we were going to try an experiment.  <br/>\n <br/>\nCome payday I was going to give them $50 and take them where ever they wanted to shop.  First off they had the option of kicking in $8 (random #) for basics: soap, shampoo, toothpaste, peanut butter, milk, juice and several other items, which of course they saw pretty quickly as a good deal (and reality check.)  No rules to begin with, but we may need to make adjustments according to how it goes.<br/>\n <br/>\nThey both did well: teenage son (15) spent every penny on fruit, raw vegies, frozen entrees and sushi, daughter, (10) the consummate fruit eater was conservative & spent half (kind of a Taurus tight-wad.)<br/>\n <br/>\nThe second week they went nuts with Pop-tarts for breakfasts and popsicles for lunch.  The third week my son decided he didn&#39;t neet any new stuff and he blew the grocery money.  I explained that we couldn&#39;t afford to give him that much money to blow.  This was an honor system, the money was to be spent only on groceries and there should be enough to take yourself out to lunch once a week.  Any left over would be part of the next week&#39;s $40.  He apologized, but I told him it was not anything to apologize for, this is an experiment and learning experience all around.  They have both been honest about how much is leftover.<br/>\n <br/>\nI believe that life is like learning to walk, falling down is part of the process and there&#39;s complete trust in the process.  At the same time, I don&#39;t think Pop-tarts are food even though they are sold in grocery stores.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI think I&#39;ve learned more than the kids did.  We spend a lot of time talking about how the world works, how the government works and why laws are the way they are.  At one point I realized that government handouts do not come without lots of strings attached and this would be the perfect time to drive that home.  I decided to tell the kids that grocery money is to be spent on groceries, not junk.  They are perfectly free to spend their own money on cookies, popsicles or whatever.  (Similar to WIC coupons not being accepted for alcohol, cigarrettes, etc.)  They don&#39;t seem to want to spend their money on junk, for some reason!<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m sure this rule seems inconsistent with the freedom to choose; it wasn&#39;t any easy decision.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe had a similar lesson on my son&#39;s birthday.  He wanted a $60 item for his birthday.  I gave him the money and told him he could do what ever he wanted with it.  He goes, &quot;No way am I spending my money on that!!&quot;  I told him that is precisely why the country is in the state it&#39;s in - it&#39;s very easy to spend someone else&#39;s money on things of little or dubious value.  One is much more careful with one&#39;s own money.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy daughter was consistently spending around $25 for groceries, so we dropped hers to $25, if she needs more for food she just has to say so, but she hasn&#39;t yet.<br/>\n <br/>\nI have talked to them about my fears of sugary cereal, popsicles, pop-tarts etc.  Neither of them have ever had a cavity and I&#39;ve had many.  (I was a junior sugar addict.)  They are brushing their teeth more often (some days), but the pendullum has to swing all the way to both sides.  If they need a few cavities to learn about sugar, that&#39;s what they&#39;ll do, either now or later in life.  Maybe they have stronger teeth than me and won&#39;t get any at all, I don&#39;t know.  <br/>\n <br/>\nBoth kids are really happy with their independence.<br/>\n <br/>\nLike I said, I make family favorites about twice a week and they are welcome to join in, mostly they do and we all really enjoy that.  The rest of the time my husband and I are on our own; &quot;candlelit dinners.&quot;  I never saw that coming!!  We eat exotice things without anyone going, &quot;eeeeeuuuuwwwwwaaaahhhhh!&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nI was a little scared at the beginning of the grocery deal, but I try to do something scary everyday.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;d like to know if anyone else is doing the grocery independence thing and how it&#39;s going.<br/>\n <br/>\nRetta<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

My 10yo was a little hesitant.  I told her she didn&#39;t have to do it, but it was just an experiment.  They love it now and so do I.  <br/>\n <br/>\nNo more complaints about dinner, I don&#39;t have to ask them to carry in their groceries.  They really think about what they need for the week.   Naturally they do go overboard on some things and we talk about it, but they dont&#39; resent me anymore for not buying &quot;good&quot; (bad) stuff.<br/>\n <br/>\nThey know we are not made of money, so they are on the honor system of spending the money only on food, and have enough for lunch out once a week.  If there&#39;s any left over we subtract it from the next week&#39;s amount.  If they really need more money for food all they have to do is say so.<br/>\n <br/>\nThey are 10 and 15yo, so my husband and I have had a number of quiet meals alone with no one bitching about when dinner will be ready or what&#39;s for dinner (husband isn&#39;t stupid!)  I make family favorite meals about twice a week that they are welcome to share or not.  Also, I supply the basics and they use the barter system, going in on stuff together.  There&#39;s a beautiful thing!<br/>\n <br/>\nGrocery shopping is marvelous use of advanced math - &#39;Mom, how much is one tomato if they&#39;re x amount per pound?&#39;<br/>\n <br/>\nPeople often comment to us how &quot;smart&quot; our children are.  I think they are independent, competent, resourceful and conscious.  All children have natural genius and when it&#39;s not snuffed out by institutions, it&#39;s surely a beautiful thing!<br/>\n <br/>\nHolt is so right when he says that what children really want is access to the adult world.  I wish I could think of a paying job ouside the home that would allow my kids to be involved when they want to.  For the life of me, I can&#39;t.  Our culture doesn&#39;t support it.<br/>\n <br/>\nRetta<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
