This discussion isn’t intended to help anyone with local laws or requirements.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I just saw the subject line clearly:   &quot;Re: Help with unschooling application”<br/>\nDon’t apply to unschool.  Don’t even mention the word.  <br/>\n<br/>\nApply to homeschool (or to home educate, whatever the term is).<br/>\nThere are lots of ideas at the link given the other day (and in case anyone missed it, here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurrriculum)\">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurrriculum)</a> for describing a less-structured learning plan.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck but I hope you’re not applying to unschool. :-)  The response will probably be no.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd check with the locals.  If it’s not too risky to fail to apply, you might try forgetting it next year, or doing it late, and seeing how that goes.  Holly was never registered to homeschool.  I was going to register her as soon as someone contacted me and said “We can’t find your forms (about Kirby or Marty, who were registered four times and once, respectively).  Nobody ever contacted me, and I was not hiding out—I was pretty blatantly out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne aspect of why a school district or a state might not track down every homeschooling family is that it will make them look worse, if it’s known how many they are.  And they’re government workers.  If they’re required to keep track of and file those applications, they get paid to do that.  They won’t get paid extra to go to more work to double check whether there is MORE work they should be doing.  If they file what comes in, they’ve done their job. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing some of us did in New Mexico, when forms needed to be notarized and mailed on paper (which is not the case anymore) was we filled out the forms, got them notarized, made photocopies for us (and enough to give anyone who asked) and the original was…. I sent mine to the government by putting it in the county landfill via the trash, but others did differently.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen time passed, and the plan was that if someone said “We don’t have your papers,” we could say “Oh, Really?   Do you want a copy?”<br/>\n<br/>\nThey would totally assume they had lost them, or the mail had, and we could send a photocopy of it, dated and notarized that it had been filled in before the deadline and all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut never once did any of us ever get a request, and so my clever plan, as clever as it was, never played all the way out.  You’re welcome to use it. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":359707411,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"Robyn Coburn &lt;dezignarob@...&gt;","profile":"dezignarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Help with unschooling application","postDate":"1459710743","msgId":76917,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxQjQ5REJBLTQ4NDgtNEM2Mi1CRkMwLUMzODI1RDcyOTI5RkBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":76915,"nextInTopic":76919,"prevInTime":76916,"nextInTime":76918,"topicId":76914,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Make sure you use the phrase heuristic confidence as a goal.
