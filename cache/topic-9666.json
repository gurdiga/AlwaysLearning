Realized I&#39;d left *ALL* of my clothing at home, so I have a <br/>\ncircus-circus outfiit now with boxer underwear that says &#39;Big Winner!&#39; <br/>\n(grin).  Stopped at various truck stops as soon as I figured they had <br/>\nhawaiian shirts on sale and a stock of big-waisted sweatpants.  I&#39;m all <br/>\nstocked up now, good and festive.  (and Y-fronts are *amazingly* <br/>\ncomfortable, ladies!   You might want to try them!)  Stopped again for gas <br/>\nsomewhere in Montana and discovered &#39;Fred&#39;s Place&#39; where the table setter <br/>\nis 95 years old if he&#39;s a day and all the ranchers looked at us curiously <br/>\nand the cook had his (pretty inane, but kind of funny) books self-published <br/>\nand on each of the tables (available for purchase!) and they have the <br/>\nWorld&#39;s Best Hamburgers!  Honest!  Had some tire-work done shortly <br/>\nthereafter and the tire place gave us (just handed the keys over - no ID, <br/>\nno nothin&#39;) this old conversion van from the early 70&#39;s, puke brown and <br/>\ngreen with the little window in the rear and shag carpeting on the walls, <br/>\nso we had fun trucking around in that for a while, trying to remember all <br/>\nthe disco tunes we knew until the tires were fixed.  Ran out of gas in <br/>\nNebraska or Iowa someplace at 11 at night.  Luckily gas was less than a <br/>\nmile away.  Hooray!  Stopped a few other places, but we&#39;d mostly just sped <br/>\nto get to Ohio where I dropped the girls off to visit awhile.  I went to <br/>\nMinnesota, then took the ferry (complete with stateroom!) from Wisconsin to <br/>\nMichigan to visit my new baby nephew and other assorted family members, <br/>\nhelped my brother paint his house, picked Rae up in Ohio again and mostly <br/>\ntook 80 back.  We stopped for barbeque in St. Louis (went up the arch then <br/>\nmade it to the local AAA office five minutes before closing, but the guy <br/>\nloved our trip and was hauling out maps left and right finding great places <br/>\nfor us to go and didn&#39;t leave until well after closing time) and Kansas <br/>\nCity (love that barbeque!)  I said I&#39;d wait to see carhenge (Nebraska) <br/>\nuntil the next trip out, so she could do four corners and I could visit an <br/>\nindian site (NM, or Arizona, I think.) I forgot my pillow in a hotel, but <br/>\ncalled them and they UPS&#39;d it back home so we didn&#39;t have to turn <br/>\naround.   Hooray!  The Extra Terrestrial highway (long and flat, funky <br/>\nvegetation!), almost running out of gas along the ET because there were <br/>\n*no* gas stations and I didn&#39;t think to turn around and fill up completely <br/>\n(15 gallon tank, it took 14.3 gallons to fill it when we finally found <br/>\ngas!), almost getting a ticket in some little bitty town in Nevada, right <br/>\nnear the California border, missing the turnoff and going south into death <br/>\nvalley (hot, hot, hot, hot!) then through Yosemite and back home to the bay <br/>\narea!<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose the most unexpected part was losing the tread on a tire - <br/>\nTwice!  I know what it feels and sounds like now and I have four new tires <br/>\non the car.  Hooray!  ..and then there was the time the air conditioner&#39;s <br/>\noverflow tube got plugged up and we started a swimming pool on the right <br/>\nside of the car.  What a hoot!  Couldn&#39;t figure it out for the longest time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best part was somewhere in Kansas, passing up seeing the six legged cow <br/>\n(thank goodness), stopping for gas and lunch, looking to the right and <br/>\nseeing the Prairie Museum.  They had a really cool sod house, The Biggest <br/>\nBarn in Kansas, an old 1800&#39;s house with furnishings and an old school <br/>\nhouse we could walk through - all on our own, with nobody else around, and <br/>\nwe could touch whatever we wanted.  The outhouse was smelly.  Still in use, <br/>\nI guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nInside was a museum that was made up of things folks have in their houses - <br/>\nand not necessarily from a long time ago.  It was kind of odd the things <br/>\nthe curator valued.  Gaudy jewelry from the 1950&#39;s like my grandmama would <br/>\nwear, in a case right next to a tiffany vase.  A little wacky!  It was kind <br/>\nof like an every-day-person&#39;s museum with stuff a person would have <br/>\naccumulated themselves.
