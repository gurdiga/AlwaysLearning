When my oldest was 2.5, my husband&#39;s father died suddenly at home.  We went to the house in the middle of the night and my daughter got to see her grandfather and everyone else who was there and clearly in shock.  No problem.  She also went to the funeral, and did kind of walk around and do 2 year old things, and again, no problem.  I think it makes people stay connected with what remains important - young, growing lives - rather than sinking too far down into the sadness of the situation.  It helps them remain hopeful that they will feel happy again.  Maybe not soon, but it will happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nJustine<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Marjorie&quot; &lt;jorie6568@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When my daughter Jossilyn died in 2007, all her siblings attended the service and my youngest was just the age of yours.

He spoke and she came up on the stage with him at one point, and spent other points crawling around under the pews peering up at the rest of the family. I don&#39;t think her presence, her joy in life detracted from the moment. I think that it made it more poignant. My grandfather loved children. Having a happy toddler at his funeral seemed better than flowers or wreath or monument. It seemed an honest monument to him. I remember my grandmother smiling at her great-granddaughter, but maybe that isn&#39;t right, maybe that is faulty memory.

She and I roamed freely throughout the service in the rooms that were not being used and I read quietly to her or she colored and drew with her crayons and markers. When my husband spoke, we were outside and came in towards the end of his eulogy, where she ran into his arms and it was a very touching moment. At the burial, she wanted to drop dirt on top of the coffin - which my husband encouraged and everyone said it was touching because my daughter wanted to say good bye to her great grandmother, whom she was close to. In the end, having our daughter be there at the service and burial meant a lot to the family members who felt seeing our daughter being herself lifted their spirits.
