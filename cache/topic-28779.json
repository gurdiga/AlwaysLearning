I never expected unschooling to be so <br/>\nmuch fun. In a way, it’s been a kind of an endless summer: eight years <br/>\nof watching Rain follow her whims and her dreams and of learning and <br/>\ngrowing alongside her.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith unschooling, no two days are the same. Some days we rise late and <br/>\nspend the day puttering around the house, maybe baking pancakes and <br/>\nreading together, gardening or watching movies. Other days we’re up <br/>\nearly and off to museums or classes or berry-picking or visits with <br/>\nfriends.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough we rarely spend an entire day together anymore, I think I <br/>\nspend more time with her than do most parents of teens. I really enjoy <br/>\nhearing her ideas and insights and jokes, and just being with her. In <br/>\nmy very biased opinion, she’s a pretty wonderful person.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the time, I don’t think in terms of traditional academics at <br/>\nall. When Rain was younger, schooled children would sometimes quiz her <br/>\non the things they were learning in their classes, like multiplication <br/>\nfacts or spelling words. They would forecast a lifetime of doom and <br/>\ngloom for her, and sometimes she would come home upset and determined <br/>\nto master the skills the schooled kids were working on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI walked a fine line, trying to support in achieving her stated goals <br/>\nwhile pointing out the things that she knew that most kids didn’t, and <br/>\ngently sharing my conviction that learning things on her own timetable <br/>\ndidn’t mean she would never learn them, if she needed to know them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she was 10 or so, her hitherto almost nonexistent writing skills <br/>\nblossomed, and within a year she was keeping a blog or two and writing <br/>\nbeautiful stories. A couple of years later, she wrote a thoughtful <br/>\nessay requesting a scholarship to a summer program and was awarded the <br/>\nhighest amount possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt didn’t matter at all that when she was 9, she would have struggled <br/>\nto write a simple paragraph. Her writing score on the SAT she took as <br/>\nan eighth-grader was well above that achieved by the average <br/>\ncollege-bound high school senior. She wrote when she was ready, and she <br/>\nenjoyed it, and I enjoyed bearing witness to the process.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere’s an idea among some people that home schooling parents need to <br/>\nknow everything their children will learn, or they’ll need to hire a <br/>\ntutor for those topics. I haven’t found this to be true. Learning <br/>\noccurs independently of teaching most of the time, and most of what I <br/>\nknow was never explicitly taught to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIndeed, I’m often surprised by what Rain knows. Through books, <br/>\ntelevision, radio, talking with people, Internet browsing, classes, <br/>\nlive lectures and perhaps osmosis, she’s acquired a rich tapestry of <br/>\nbackground knowledge and an impressive skill base. The availability of <br/>\nresources for learning in today’s world is amazing to me, and Rain has <br/>\nlearned to maneuver this world with dexterity and grace.<br/>\n<br/>\nI’m always here if she needs me, but I would never want to be her only <br/>\nsource of information. I like that she can explore the world and make <br/>\nher own choices. She doesn’t always agree with me, and I think that’s a <br/>\ngood thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don’t consider unschooling to be a sacrifice on my part but an active <br/>\nnegotiation between the two of us. In our family, we pull together, and <br/>\nunschooling is just an extension of that. Since Rain was born, I’ve <br/>\nalways either worked or been a student or both, and I’ve tried to apply <br/>\nthe principles of unschooling to my life as well as Rain’s.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do the things that I want to do, and I truly enjoy all facets of my <br/>\nlife (well, except housework!). I feel so fortunate that Rain and I are <br/>\nable to live this way.<br/>\n<br/>\n****************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish she could&#39;ve found joy in housework too! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAOL now offers free email to everyone.
