I just loved him to death.  I tried and tried to get him<br/>\ninterested in me.  I even tried out for the school play so I could kiss him<br/>\n(he was the lead in a romantic comedy) I wasn&#39;t half bad looking back then<br/>\nand couldn&#39;t figure out why he wasn&#39;t interested at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomebody told me he had a girlfriend in Oklahoma, a few hours away.  I was<br/>\nbummed but figured that explained it.  Several years later, I learned that<br/>\nRicky was gay, had known about it for years and had run off with another<br/>\nfriend from High School to California.  It broke my heart when I learned<br/>\nthey both died of AIDS.  They were good friends and I miss them.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps a long distance romance could also solve some problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":779600,"authorName":"KathrynJB@aol.com","from":"KathrynJB@...","profile":"kathrynbeth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Gay and Parents","postDate":"1011844473","msgId":2946,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMzLjIxNDYwNjUyLjI5ODBkZjc5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":2959,"prevInTime":2945,"nextInTime":2947,"topicId":2946,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 01/23/2002 9:59:34 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...

My son, who is 14 today (wow! when did <br/>\n&gt; THAT happen??) has a very good (also 14) friend who confided in him a year <br/>\n&gt; ago that she&#39;s gay. She&#39;s been debating for months on how/when to tell her <br/>\n&gt; parents, and it came out vaguely in a heated argument a week ago. Two days <br/>\n&gt; ago, her parents had rummaged through her room and found a love letter from <br/>\n&gt; her girlfriend. They attacked her with it, and she ran over here in tears <br/>\n&gt; that night.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Her parents are very religious (SC, remember) and homophobic and know that <br/>\n&gt; she&#39;s going straight to hell. Her older sister was &quot;Miss Blue Devil&quot;, a <br/>\n&gt; social butterfly, and modeled for a while; and this girl can&#39;t do anything <br/>\n&gt; right.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She&#39;s really a delightful girl---her parents only see &quot;dyke&quot;. They&#39;ve taken <br/>\n&gt; away her phone, her computer, all functions (no going out with friends, no <br/>\n&gt; movies, no parties, etc), and (worst of all) called her friend&#39;s parents <br/>\n&gt; and <br/>\n&gt; &quot;outed&quot; this girl as well to her parents! Both girls are very upset---and <br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t even speak to each other! They don&#39;t go to the same school, so they <br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t even see each other there.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She&#39;s welcome to use our phone and computer (although the other girl&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; parents have agreed that they are NEVER to speak to each other again) and <br/>\n&gt; just to hang out here as much as possible.&lt; I guess the &quot;straight&quot; boy&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; not <br/>\n&gt; seen as a threat.&gt; And she seems to need to talk both to Cameron and to me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I was hoping for *something* from y&#39;all---especially maybe <br/>\n&gt; KathrynB---something that I could give her to help her through this. My <br/>\n&gt; advice so far has been to &quot;lay low&quot; and not stir things up. And that they <br/>\n&gt; can <br/>\n&gt; control her environment, but not her thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and <br/>\n&gt; sexuality. And to write a letter telling her parents calmly and gently how <br/>\n&gt; she feels (all conversations turn into &quot;who can yell the loudest&quot;). <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anything else from y&#39;all?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks so much!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kelly<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh, my!  My first thought, of course, was *She can come live with us!*<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly, the first, best thing, is that she has you and your son. One of the <br/>\nbiggest reasons the suicide rate among gay teens is so high is that they have <br/>\nNO ONE.  You two have the opportunity to let her know that she&#39;s okay, she&#39;s <br/>\nnormal, that she&#39;s loved.  You know how to say, &quot;uh-huh, yes, isn&#39;t it <br/>\nterrible&quot; to her parents (or to educate them if you think that&#39;s possible, <br/>\nbut it&#39;s more important that they let you be with her) and to give her space <br/>\nand resources and options.<br/>\n<br/>\nFourteen sucks. She has a long time before she can really be free of her <br/>\nparents, and they CAN control her environment. Your advice to lie low is <br/>\nprobably best at this point. I&#39;ll try to come up with some resources she can <br/>\nkeep at your house. Where do you live? There may be some local groups she can <br/>\nconnect with. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll think about this and try to think of some other ideas. <br/>\n<br/>\nKelly...thank you SO much for being there for her. <br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn Baptista<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2958,"nextTopicId":2885}}
