All the man-made &quot;religion&quot; that has nothing to do with the <br/>\nBible drives me nuts.  I&#39;m by no means a Bible scholar, but here are <br/>\na few things that jumped out at me.  Maybe they could be helpful to <br/>\nsomeone who has friends or family in this camp.<br/>\n<br/>\n==========We need to begin by defining sports for the purpose of this <br/>\ndiscussion because there are a wide variety of activities that are <br/>\ncalled sports, and some are beyond the scope of this Corner. The <br/>\nfirst use of the word &quot;sport&quot; in Scripture is found in Judges <br/>\n16:25. &quot;And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they <br/>\nsaid, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for <br/>\nSamson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set <br/>\nhim between the pillars.&quot; According to Strong&#39;s Talking Hebrew and <br/>\nGreek Dictionary, the Hebrew word for sport is &quot;sahaq&quot; and is also <br/>\ntranslated to play (10 times), laugh (10), rejoice (3), scorn (3), <br/>\nsport (3), and five other words. To play and have a good time is a <br/>\nprimary thread woven into the fabric of why sports are important to <br/>\nfamilies today and a key aspect of its definition. <br/>\n<br/>\nNext, I went to a number of resources to see what our modern English <br/>\ndefinition of sports would be. Merriam-Webster primarily defines <br/>\nsport as &quot;a source of diversion, recreation, a physical activity <br/>\nengaged in for pleasure such as an athletic game.&quot; To compete is the <br/>\nheart of most athletic games and compete is defined as, &quot;To strive <br/>\nconsciously or unconsciously for an objective (as position, profit, <br/>\nor prize): be in a state if rivalry.&quot; And finally rival is defined <br/>\nas, &quot;one of two or more striving to reach or obtain something that <br/>\nonly one can possess.&quot; So for the purpose of this discussion, let&#39;s <br/>\ndefine sports as, &quot;physical activities that are fun or pleasurable <br/>\nwhere the purpose is to compete and win against another person or <br/>\nteam.&quot; Whether the sport is officially organized and whether they <br/>\nkeep score has some bearing, but we won&#39;t make that part of the <br/>\ndefinition.========<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s simply not logical to compare the Hebrew word, translated into <br/>\nOld English with the modern American English use of the word to make <br/>\na point.  What that verse actually says in plain English is that they <br/>\nmocked and made fun of Sampson.  Not a virtue, and hopefully not <br/>\nanything promoted by modern sports.  <br/>\n<br/>\n=======That is why Jesus would say to His disciples in Matthew <br/>\n16:24, &quot;. . . If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, <br/>\nand take up his cross, and follow me.&quot; If fun is our motive in <br/>\nactivities, no one is going to take Matthew 16:24 seriously because <br/>\nthere is nothing fun about self-sacrifice and self-denial.========<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is speaking to adults, and has nothing to do with parenting.  It <br/>\ndoes not say &quot;be miserable for me,&quot; or &quot;make your children miserable <br/>\nfor me.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n========On the other hand, the Christian faith is where we can all be <br/>\nwinners, and we are all trying to attain the crown together. I help <br/>\nyou, and you help me. We all win together. &quot;Henceforth there is laid <br/>\nup for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous <br/>\njudge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all <br/>\nthem also that love his appearing&quot; (2 Timothy 4:8). Sports train us <br/>\nto receive pleasure in putting ourselves first and others down. <br/>\nHowever, life in Christ is all about putting ourselves last while we <br/>\nattempt to lift others up.===========<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about those that don&#39;t &quot;love his appearing?&quot;  There will always <br/>\nbe someone on the other side.  It&#39;s also part of the Christian faith <br/>\nto try to gently encourage others to find the same joy in Christ that <br/>\nwe have.  It can also be part of sports to encourage your team, and <br/>\ntwo teams can fine-tune each other through competition, so they can <br/>\nboth excel.  I wonder if they are against spelling bees and Bible <br/>\nmemorizing contests.    <br/>\n<br/>\n=========&quot;Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; <br/>\nin honour preferring one another&quot; (Romans 12:10).========<br/>\n<br/>\n=========Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself&quot; (Romans <br/>\n13:9).=========<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this is the way we are to treat our brothers and neighbours, <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t it be especially the way we should treat our children?  How <br/>\ndoes the rest of the website promote that?<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that they don&#39;t like the often cruel, shaming, <br/>\nantagonistic aspect of many sports.  I don&#39;t believe sports, even <br/>\ncompetitive ones, have to be that way though.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the record, I&#39;m a Messianic Christian.  We aren&#39;t a big sports <br/>\nfamily, though dh played football in highschool, and I enjoy <br/>\nbasketball and soccer.  If my children want to play sports I will <br/>\ncertainly support that.  I would not tolerate a coach or anyone <br/>\ndemeaning, shaming or belittling my child or the other team.  But <br/>\nsports can be played with a spirit of love. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;d probably have a heart attack at my church!  With Davidic <br/>\ndance, shofars, tamborines, bongos, we have a lot of fun.  :)     <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m working on cleaning up some webpages this morning, and I <br/>\nfollowed  <br/>\n&gt; a link to make sure it still worked, and I clicked something from  <br/>\n&gt; there, and I wandered away.  But I found this clear explanation <br/>\nfor  <br/>\n&gt; why having fun is a sin.

If any of you come across any, I  <br/>\n&gt; guess I should collect them.  Sometimes unschoolers are too <br/>\ncavalier  <br/>\n&gt; and &quot;whatever&quot; about their joy and happiness, I think, and don&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; realize what the objections really are.  The U.S. has more  <br/>\n&gt; Puritanical history than other English speaking countries, so I <br/>\nthink  <br/>\n&gt; the prejudice against having fun might be worse here.   Do the <br/>\nAmish  <br/>\n&gt; discourage sports and playing among children?

As a non-sporty person myself, I sometimes feel a <br/>\nbit on the outer because discussing sport is one of the standard elements of general <br/>\nconversation.  With regard to kids having fun, I may be seeing this through an unschooling <br/>\nfilter, but I think generally kids here are encouraged to have fun OUTSIDE (ie. away from <br/>\nthe mummies so they can talk).  And then parent participation can be a bit lacking (I&#39;m <br/>\nreferring to younger children here - my oldest is nearly 4).<br/>\n<br/>\nI followed the links to the board Sandra found and it looked like something from the stone <br/>\nage - wives &#39;submitting&#39; to husbands, &#39;God&#39; directly intervening in people&#39;s lives.  There is <br/>\na theory that many of the world&#39;s current woes can be traced to the split between body <br/>\nand spirit found in monotheistic religions.  Denying our bodily urges, pleasures and needs <br/>\ndivorces us from the natural world, hence the exploitation of animals, of the earth, global <br/>\nwarming ... <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving fun, exploring our physicality through sport and other activities is part of being <br/>\nhuman.  To deny these things is to work against our own nature.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robyn L.

But I found this clear explanation for  <br/>\nwhy having fun is a sin.   And I&#39;m not saying it IS a sin, but I&#39;m  <br/>\nsaying some of you might have relatives and  neighbors and maybe  <br/>\nsocial workers or doctors who believe more as this writer believes  <br/>\nthan as most unschoolers I know believe.  It&#39;s worth knowing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***That is why Jesus would say to His disciples in Matthew 16:24,  <br/>\n&quot;. . . If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take  <br/>\nup his cross, and follow me.&quot; If fun is our motive in activities, no  <br/>\none is going to take Matthew 16:24 seriously because there is nothing  <br/>\nfun about self-sacrifice and self-denial.***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was in an article about why a certain type of serious Christian  <br/>\nfamily should keep their children from playing sports.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.titus2.com/corners/11-08-d.htm\">http://www.titus2.com/corners/11-08-d.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI went there because I hadn&#39;t known some families were so anti- <br/>\nsports.  It&#39;s on the list of things the Titus2 moms board wants  <br/>\npeople to discourage (&quot;no sports&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone on this list thinks I&#39;m too narrow in my ideas about what  <br/>\nshould and shouldn&#39;t be discussed here, check this set of rules:<br/>\n<br/>\nMOMSBoard FAQ and Posting Criteria<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.titus2.com/momsboard/m-board-info.htm\">http://www.titus2.com/momsboard/m-board-info.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other quotes I&#39;ve heard but didn&#39;t keep about foolishness  <br/>\nand play and other bad things.  If any of you come across any, I  <br/>\nguess I should collect them.  Sometimes unschoolers are too cavalier  <br/>\nand &quot;whatever&quot; about their joy and happiness, I think, and don&#39;t  <br/>\nrealize what the objections really are.  The U.S. has more  <br/>\nPuritanical history than other English speaking countries, so I think  <br/>\nthe prejudice against having fun might be worse here.   Do the Amish  <br/>\ndiscourage sports and playing among children?  I&#39;m curious now.
