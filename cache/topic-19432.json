We have found that something","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1475491123\">One of the things we have found that helps kids  develop a special friendship is to  invite  someone  along as a special  outing.<br/>\nWe have found that something like a picnic, weiner roast-even in your own backyard although we go to a variety   of creeks, natural areas.  A place where the parents can relax and do the food or go along on exploring walks;  and the kids can wade, explore etc.  and play works better for us that  a place full of other people or  events . The kids then get to remember together say &quot;hey, remember that cool place we found on the picnic that was  like a cave&quot; or ?.<br/>\nTalking to the kids and then making phone calls to the parents first helps  settle all the worries like-will it be safe, will you be there at all times. what time will you be back. what do your kids like to eat-do they have any allergies.&quot;<br/>\nGoing to an event with an other child hasnt always worked well as the friends get caught up in that and not in having fun with your child  and family. Also inviting the friends brother or sister can work well  as the friend wont feel so isolated and   often  they are used to going places together anyway.<br/>\nThere are no other children in our immediate rural area and no homeschoolers anywhere around. Having a group of Unschoolers around would be  incredible. <br/>\ngrace<br/>\n in the BC Rockies where  the girls are off for the day  at friends  and I am Supposed to be...making a dance recital skirt.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"Deb Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Help","postDate":"1082814813","msgId":19432,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwNDI0LjA3NTMzNC40ODQuMC5kZHppbWxld0BqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":19442,"prevInTime":19431,"nextInTime":19433,"topicId":19432,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***I would not automatically assume that she/he saw me as a mean person and take offense to that plea.*** Great!

History? <br/>\nWhat kinds of games does he like to play?<br/>\nWhat are his favorite TV shows?  His favorite movies? <br/>\nDoes he like to go for walks?<br/>\nDoes he like to go boating?

Ask him to<br/>\nshow you how to draw Japanese style animated characters.  Ask him if you<br/>\ncan read with him, or to him.  Take him places and have fun.   Kids don&#39;t<br/>\nneed kids in order to be doing fun things, they just need someone fun. <br/>\nJump on the trampoline with him.  Play Frisbee, lay out in the grass and<br/>\nwatch the stars.  Give him the best from a happy companion and he&#39;ll feel<br/>\nhappier.   <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19435,"nextTopicId":19465}}
