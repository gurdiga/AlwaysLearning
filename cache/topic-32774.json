Okay here is an example:<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went to the park yesterday and my daughter (8 yo)asked me to play <br/>\nwith her.  As we were on the giant play structure, I looked down at <br/>\nthe platform we were standing on and noticed that it was in the shape <br/>\nof a hexagon.  I said, &quot;Look, a hexagon!&quot;  Dd looked down, then <br/>\nwalked the perimeter of it counting the sides to make sure it was <br/>\nindeed a hexagon with 6 sides.  During our play, she would sometimes <br/>\nnotice hexagons and I would point some out to her.  After we found a <br/>\nfew, she said, &quot;That&#39;s all the shapes I want to find&quot; and I <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Okay.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nLast night as I thought about our day, I wondered if I was being too <br/>\nschoolish.  Maybe I should not have even pointed the hexagon out to <br/>\nher.   In the past (like the recent past!), I would turn everything <br/>\ninto an &quot;educational experience.&quot;  This time, though, I just noticed <br/>\nthe hexagon and drew my daughter&#39;s attention to it before I thought. <br/>\nI love patterns (patterns in nature, quilt patterns, etc.), and so I <br/>\njust naturally commented on it.  I didn&#39;t require her to find any of <br/>\nthe shapes, but I wonder if maybe she was trying to please me or if <br/>\nshe was interested in it as well.  She seemed to be interested. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I am just not totally sure what unschooling really looks <br/>\nlike.   When I first discovered the term unschooling, I thought it <br/>\nmeant pretty much hands off.  I now know that is not true, but I <br/>\nspent the first month or so thinking that was what it was.  Then I <br/>\njoined this group and lately there have been some really good topics <br/>\nthat have me thinking more and more. <br/>\n<br/>\nGuess I am still unsure of myself.  The above situation felt natural <br/>\nto me, but then I wonder if I don&#39;t really know what natural feels <br/>\nlike since my past has probably altered my conception of reality.    <br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32751,"nextTopicId":32703}}
