That&#39;s<br/>\nwhere I usually come in, to translate. That&#39;s also why<br/>\nI used to attribute this behaviour to shyness.

Besides, my mom is hardly a threatening or<br/>\ndangerous character &lt;g&gt;. In fact she&#39;s a real<br/>\nkindhearted lady and is very loving. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Well, that&#39;s basically a lot a rambling from a<br/>\nperson who has no real idea.<br/>\nSorry Meghan,<br/>\nDeb L&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, really, thank you Deb. This is just the sort of<br/>\nthing that can maybe help me to stumble across a new<br/>\nidea that I haven&#39;t thought of or tried.

So many people do this to homeschooled<br/>\nkids, try  to get them to say what they&#39;ve learned.    Are they bossing<br/>\nher?   Maybe she thinks it would be rude to say,  &quot; Grandma, please don&#39;t<br/>\ntest me.&quot;  or &quot;Please don&#39;t tell me what to do.&quot;  So she just pretends<br/>\nshe can&#39;t hear it.  We spend a lot of time encouraging kids to be<br/>\nconsiderate of other people, maybe she doesn&#39;t know she has a right to<br/>\npolitely ask them not to do that thing that&#39;s bothering her.<br/>\nBlanking might be the Tamzin version of &quot;would you look at the time, I<br/>\nhave to run!&quot;<br/>\nI do it all the time!  To my mom, too!  It&#39;s a very useful tool.&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAre they people who arrive, maybe, when she had something else planned<br/>\nthat they are now interrupting?  Maybe she thinks THEY are being rude.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs she afraid if she shows interest and love for them she&#39;s being<br/>\ndisloyal to you?  <br/>\nSome kids don&#39;t figure out right away that letting another person close<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t squeeze everybody else out.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids are very good at reading body language and other cues, maybe<br/>\nshe feels they&#39;re not all that friendly and so is protecting herself. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that&#39;s basically a lot a rambling from a person who has no real<br/>\nidea.<br/>\nSorry Meghan,<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3316,"nextTopicId":3557}}
