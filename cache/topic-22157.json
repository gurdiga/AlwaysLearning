I never knew how to put into words my philosophy and <br/>\nidea of learning versus schooling.  When I read about the difference <br/>\nbetween principles & rules that sort of summed it up for me.  I have <br/>\nhomeschooled since 1985 but my idea was unschool and my school <br/>\nteacher husband&#39;s idea of school at home for his sons.  So we got <br/>\nsomething in between and that did not work out so well.  I gave up <br/>\nand sent all seven sons to school after the stillbirth of my eighth <br/>\nson.  Since that time I&#39;ve had two daughters and in 2001 one of my <br/>\ntwin sons died at the age of 20 by getting hit by a car.  About 6 <br/>\nyears ago we moved and took the kids out of school and have been <br/>\nsomewhat unschooling my sons 16y, 15y, 13y, 12y, and daughters 9y and <br/>\n8y ever since.  15 year old son wants to go to school because he <br/>\nwants to meet friends.   He loves to skateboard and says everyone <br/>\nskates with their friends from school and they always laugh when he <br/>\nsays he&#39;s homeschooled.  My husband comes from a long line of <br/>\nteachers and they think we are absolutely crazy to let the kids learn <br/>\non their own.  We belong to a Baptist church but we are quite the <br/>\nanomally having more than two children and unschooling. My children <br/>\nresent being different so they try to fit in by wearing the baggy <br/>\npants and listening to this rap music like their peers at church.  <br/>\nThey play Halo 2 online as often as they are able.  They complain <br/>\nthat I&#39;ve not taught them to spell and yet they do very little if any <br/>\nreading.  My house is full of books and I must admit much unused <br/>\ncurriculum.    Thanks for being out there in more ways than one.  <br/>\nDottie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22162,"nextTopicId":22167}}
