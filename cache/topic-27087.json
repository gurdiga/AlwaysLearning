A waistline on a skirt often ends up as four or more layers of fabric folded &nbsp;around the waist. That amount of fabric&nbsp;bulks up that teeny tiny waistline when the doll is dressed so that she looks relatively normal for a fashion model.&nbsp;All fashion dolls are somewhat unrealistically thin, but it is&nbsp;not so much because the makers&nbsp;of dolls malignantly&nbsp;want to impose an unrealistic body image on girls to destroy their self esteem,&nbsp;but because they want the dolls to look stylishly slender once they are&nbsp;actually dressed.

Veda doesn&#39;t seem to mind since there&#39;s a lot of other options for them to choose from but videos like these that are considered &quot;dangerous&quot; have helped her and me understand about choices, respecting others preferences and not necessarily talking about topics that might  offend others (moms included). Its led to lots of talking about why people might not like monster high and MLP and Veda came up with the idea that &quot;people might think they are scary or something&quot; which I thought was pretty good logic for her age:).We talk all the time so its been a process of trying to piece together what makes it work while sharing some of this stuff with friends especially when we dont exactly live in a community that has any unschoolers/homeschoolers in our complex especially since thats where we spend pretty much most or all of our time for a variety of reasons. </div>\n<div><br></div><div>I was myself a little concerned by the language usage not so much about how how it would influence her, but more so her using it inappropriately and more so inadvertantly, but it hasn&#39;t happened so far yet What has happened is discoveryof  a variety of use of voices and accents and imitation of the various girls talking styles, clothe styles, dressing styles, dance videos, artwork, pinterest, discovery of youtube videos where children post videos playing with MLP toys using a variety of dialogues, own scripts and she enjoys watching these and re-enacting them herself. </div>\n\n<div><br></div><div>Actually barbie is quite popular here in India, so there are quite a few many older children in our complex that enjoy the barbie stuff with Veda including the make up, the mobile app games, the colouring book, the clothes etc.Some moms do rant about Barbie and their sexiness but I think Barbie pales in comparison to some of the crass Bollywood dishes out to kids and Indian children are exposed to that often very early on so its a bit ironic in reality:)</div>\n<div><br></div><div>The movie about Odette- the animation was done in Chennai which led to conversations myself and her and her dad about animation, Hollywood and Chennai (we have family in chennai). While she might not exactly get all the parts of the movie  we have been treated to many a private performances of ballet by Veda. We ended making a tutu that didn&#39;t turn out so great since the material wasn&#39;t the right one, but that was an enjoyable experience in itself. Barbie was the color inspiration for our fake Christmas tree this year. Rainbow dash was the color theme for our Diwali Rangoli this November.</div>\n<div><br></div><div>She is very much immersed in Barbie and MLP.

I don’t think \nthey damaged my character or limited my life choices or intellect.&nbsp; I’m not \nobsessed with my appearance.&nbsp; I earned a BA and MA and was ABD for my \nPh.D.&nbsp; I’ve only been married once, but that has been for more than 25 \nyears, so playing with Barbie as a little girl&nbsp; did not make me flighty or \nsexually promiscuous. Actually my interest in fashion dolls as a child led to an \ninterest in fashion and sewing in my teens and 20s.&nbsp; I’m essentially a self \ntaught sewer. Throughout high school and college and grad school as I studied \nliterature, wrote poetry, taught high school and college English, I also sewed \nfor myself and for children I knew. When my daughter was a baby and I was alone \nat home with her, I taught myself how to make curtains and slip covers and then \nearned extra money sewing them for other moms in the neighborhood.&nbsp; In my \nearly 40s I started collecting Barbies again and I funded my hobby by sewing \nprofessionally for dolls. I am now designing doll clothes for adult collectors \nand am well known in the doll world and win competitions for contemporary and \nhistoric fashion designs. I’ve learned lots about the history of clothing and \ncostume pursuing this hobby. I stopped teaching when I had my child, and now I \nam doing what I love as I unschool my daughter. She sees me doing the work that \nI taught myself to do and that encourages her to realize that she can pursue her \nown interests and that they are valuable.&nbsp; My daughter,now 15, has been \nunschooled since she was 10. She adored princess Barbies as a little girl and \nshe still likes dolls but is not in any way interested in fashion or obsessed \nwith her own appearance. She still likes Monster High dolls but is now more \ninterested in creating cartoon art and working on the computer.&nbsp; </div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Barbie does not have to be a bad influence on girls. In fact, Barbie was \nactually the first doll that emphasized that girls could be more than mothers. \nThe lady who invented Barbie was a founder of Mattel – she was a working \nprofessional woman.&nbsp; She presented Barbie as a working fashion model, a \nfashion designer, a&nbsp; teacher, a nurse, an astronaut, a college student, an \nactress all before 1965. After that Barbie’s and women’s career choices \nexploded. I admit that I also worried a bit as Katy grew up whether my \ncollection of pretty dolls (Barbie and 16” fashion dolls) and my hobby of making \npretty clothes would make her think pretty was all that mattered for women. But \nsince I was a slightly dumpy woman in her 40s and 50s with glasses, dressed \nperpetually in jeans and black shirts I think she realized that real women don’t \nlook like dolls.&nbsp; I always told my daughter that dolls had no insides so \nall their pretty had to be on the outside because that’s all they have. They are \nworks of fantasy and art and not images of what a woman must look like. Let your \nchild play with a Barbie.

My daughter is 15 and very self possessed.  She was telling me the other day how terrible Barbie is for a girl&#39;s self concept.  That all of the messages sent by the unrealistic body shape was just not good!  We then had a long, interesting discussion about how she managed to grow up thinking that her body was just fine, beautiful even...   And the learning that went with that discussion was amazing!</div>\n<div>chris</div></span></blockquote></div></div></div>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] RE: Barbie","postDate":"1387246915","msgId":72929,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQ5NTlBNDcxLUU2OEQtNDhCOC04M0E2LUJDNkY2ODI2Q0Q2NkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGw4b2FlditlbzdvN3FAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGw4bm8wZyt1YTYwNTJAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPiA8bDhvYWV2K2VvN283cUBZYWhvb0dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":72928,"nextInTopic":72930,"prevInTime":72928,"nextInTime":72930,"topicId":27087,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Get your daughter a Barbie.

He&#39;s her man. Right now there&#39;s a picture of Mo-the-Hedgehog kissing Shadow under the mistletoe as the wallpaper on my desktop.

shift my perspective about this so that I can get her the toys she wants without any of my baggage encroaching on her joy.&nbsp; Can anyone share some insight or a link to where this subject is discussed?&nbsp; Not necessarily just about Barbie, but about judging some toys as better or more appropriate than others.&nbsp; Thank you!<br>\n\n    </div>\n     \n\n    \n    <div

I was just as thrilled as Vivi! We started off with a barbie with long straight hair. Her hair wasn&#39;t in very good condition, it was quite fluffy and a bit matted. We coated the hair in gel, divided into small sections and then rolled them onto bits of drinking straws, secured by pipe cleaners, pinning them to her head to secure. Next was dunking her head in boiling water for 18 seconds, then icy water for a few seconds. We left her to dry and then took the rollers out. She now has beautiful spiral curls.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went to rock&#39;n&#39;roll dancing last night (a homeschool group thing) and took the barbie to show her off. The main response from the other homeschooling parents was that it was a rather bizzare idea and pretty pointless (the kids thought it was real cool).
