We have found it pretty successful with my two oldest<br/>\nkids (6 and 7 years) to share more details about the budget of our household<br/>\nand what various things cost that we buy and pay for. I once told my<br/>\ndaughter that a gallon of gas was more than $4 and she said, &quot;That doesn&#39;t<br/>\nsound like a lot&quot;. Later, she asked how often I had to buy &quot;one&quot;. I told her<br/>\nthat our car took 15 gallons to fill up and we went there once per week (at<br/>\nleast) and she started to do the math.<br/>\n<br/>\n  To enable them to buy the things they want and to make decisions about how<br/>\nthe household money should be spent, we give them what my in-laws consider<br/>\nan obscene amount of money &quot;allowance&quot; each week to use however they like.<br/>\nThey quite often buy things that I consider junk or that I predict they will<br/>\nbe disappointed with but we really try to give them tools to make their own<br/>\nevaluation. They have found lots of fun and excitement in toys that we never<br/>\nwould have thought to buy for them. They have also been disappointed at<br/>\ntimes. My daughter (8) has become the most frugal person I know and has over<br/>\n$800 in her savings account. My son prefers to try out lots of things with<br/>\nno regrets and rarely has 2 dimes to rub together. Either way, they rarely<br/>\nask us to buy something for them but sometimes lament that something is &quot;too<br/>\nexpensive&quot; or &quot;not worth the cost&quot;. Sometimes I get extra money from work as<br/>\na bonus and I give a portion of it to each of the kids. My daughter got $80<br/>\nextra last month and she put it all in the bank. My son bought a Nintendo DS<br/>\nand some Pokemon cards.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Maybe if you share with your son about all of the expenses and how much<br/>\nmoney there is to work with each month, he will want to work with you to<br/>\nmake the most of your purchasing power and even help to save money in other<br/>\nareas. Our kids will sometimes notice when there is money to be saved and<br/>\nsay &quot;why don&#39;t we go to Costco on the way back from the library later<br/>\ninstead of going out twice?&quot;.  I&#39;m still hoping my kids will get excited<br/>\nabout turning off the lights when they are not in the room, but I&#39;m also<br/>\nconsidering timer switches since it&#39;s essentially my issue at this point.<br/>\n<br/>\n  At first, we didn&#39;t tell them about all of the housing and car expenses,<br/>\njust how much there was to work with after the household was paid for. Now<br/>\nwe found that they really can help more with more information. For example,<br/>\nwe told them we had $300 for new clothes this fall. We try to shop when all<br/>\nof the &quot;back to school&quot; sales are on. They were able to pick out way more<br/>\nthan we had hoped and passed by everything that I predict many of the kids<br/>\nare asking for these days. They notice that you pay more for brands, and<br/>\nsometime they choose to pay more. Sometimes they don&#39;t but it&#39;s there call.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t believe that our budget is an arbitrary limit, but there are some<br/>\ngotchas in there. If we are saving for retirement, or saving for a trip, or<br/>\nsaving for their college, or for medical emergencies, we consider those<br/>\nessential where they may not. This has got them to thinking about their own<br/>\nlong term goals and saving their own money.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Dan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, Nov 25, 2008 at 9:56 AM, mnbyelich &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nbyelich@...\">nbyelich@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   Hi, I need some ideas on an issue I&#39;m having with my son please. we<br/>\n&gt; are new to unschooling, and particularly radical unschooling, and so<br/>\n&gt; far things are really cool but I&#39;m having a hard time in this one<br/>\n&gt; area.

I guess as I write this, I&#39;m thinking<br/>\n&gt; that I really need to be stimulating his interests to a greater<br/>\n&gt; degree. Although, with a budget which is dwindling daily :( I find<br/>\n&gt; less resources to get him or take him to interesting places.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t want to squelch his desires and his wants but with a limited<br/>\n&gt; budget I really feel strapped but find it hard to say no. For<br/>\n&gt; example, this morning he asked for a book...fine, I love buying him<br/>\n&gt; books...but we just bought him something yesterday so I suggested<br/>\n&gt; that we get the book from the library...he started crying and whining<br/>\n&gt; that he wanted a NEW book that he hasn&#39;t read before. We just went<br/>\n&gt; to the library yesterday and have lots of unread books around the<br/>\n&gt; house. Obviously he is needing something and not getting it!

My son is 6 yo and the oldest (and first grandchild on my <br/>\nside) and we have always given him most of the things he has wanted <br/>\nbut recently, we have had to really start budgeting our money.  So, <br/>\nalthough I&#39;ve been trying to say &quot;yes&quot; to him (including things <br/>\nlike &quot;how about putting that on your christmas list, how about <br/>\nputting that on your bday list, let&#39;s look at getting that next week <br/>\nwhen we don&#39;t have to get this other thing for you today, or since we <br/>\njust got this wii game ($65) we&#39;ll try for it another week...etc) <br/>\nhe&#39;s is just not satisfied with this unless he gets something THAT <br/>\nday.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not like he used to get things every day (when I wasn&#39;t on a <br/>\nstricter budget) but lately it seems that he is asking for things <br/>\neveryday that he just must have or he begins crying and whining.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s not like he would get things everyday before and I have just <br/>\nbriefly discussed our trimming down of the budget (although I do say <br/>\nthat with me not working there is less money in the house) but this <br/>\nreally seems to be a new behavior.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI did read some of the posts on spoiling and agree that giving kids <br/>\nwhat they want doesn&#39;t spoil them so I&#39;m not really worried about <br/>\nthat, it&#39;s that I&#39;m wondering what he is needing from me or his life <br/>\nthat he keeps needing things.  I guess as I write this, I&#39;m thinking <br/>\nthat I really need to be stimulating his interests to a greater <br/>\ndegree.  Although, with a budget which is dwindling daily :( I find <br/>\nless resources to get him or take him to interesting places. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to squelch his desires and his wants but with a limited <br/>\nbudget I really feel strapped but find it hard to say no.  For <br/>\nexample, this morning he asked for a book...fine, I love buying him <br/>\nbooks...but we just bought him something yesterday so I suggested <br/>\nthat we get the book from the library...he started crying and whining <br/>\nthat he wanted a NEW book that he hasn&#39;t read before.  We just went <br/>\nto the library yesterday and have lots of unread books around the <br/>\nhouse. Obviously he is needing something and not getting it!
