He was tired and frustrated one afternoon and when this happens he actually speaks so quickly that I cannot understand what he is saying. I also know that there plenty of feelings and emotions he tries to express but isn&#39;t quite sure how. Add all this together and you get a meltdown, with him at least. I hugged him and just whispered to him while he cried, once he calmed down and had a sippy cup of chocolate milk (I knew he was also hungry but too upset to eat so a quick fix until he was ready to eat as well) we were able to talk. He looked at me and said calmly that I wasn&#39;t listening to his words. We were sitting on the floor still though I leaned over a little bit so we were on the same level. I asked him to repeat slowly what he had said so that I could hear his words. He looked at me and said, &quot;No, mommy LISTEN not hear.&quot; He was trying to explain what he had been<br/>\n doing with his friend and I didn&#39;t catch a few key words. He got frustrated because I was missing a key element of his story. So we talked about how to listen to each others words. Once he got frustrated he couldn&#39;t put his thoughts together, something I totally relate to. So we decided that when this happens we will both sit down and take a deep breath. I have also started asking him to slow down so that I can listen to his words or if I need to tell him something I remind him that he needs to listen to mommy&#39;s words too. But when I hear him say you are not listening to my words I know he is getting frustrated with me or someone else. <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps your daughter saying she wants a new mommy is a similar message. Something is going on and she doesn&#39;t feel you are listening to what she is saying. I know with my son there are times when he doesn&#39;t know the right word to express what he is thinking so we have to sit and figure it out. We have also had bouts of &quot;I hate you!&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t want you!&quot; And other such expressions. It is frustration, tired, and or hungry with my son. 4 years old seems to be one of those transitions in development. Still very much a baby/toddler but becoming a &quot;big kid&quot; too. Both of my kids wanted to hold on to being babies and at the same time wanted to be big kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nTake what your daughter is saying seriously but not to heart. She loves her mommy but maybe she needs something different from mommy now than when she did even 2 weeks ago, 2 months ago, etc. Roleplaying would be a good way to find out what she needs or help her figure out what she needs. As for wanting to be with daddy and having a strong relationship with him support that. It is an awesome thing for kids to have happy, healthy relationships with both parents. They don&#39;t belong to either one of you but to themselves. They will just express it in different ways. Your daughter is confident enough in your love of her to try to tell you she needs something else. It isn&#39;t her responsibility to make sure you are self confident but it is yours to help her build her confidence in herself. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs an aside, my daughter used to tell me I was fired when she got frustrate with me.

Eric will accept me if David isn&#39;t home but  <br/>\notherwise it&#39;s got to be David. Doesn&#39;t seem like that big a deal to  <br/>\nme. I&#39;m with them all the time and we have a great time, they climb on  <br/>\nme and hug me, they&#39;re affectionate, they obviously love me. It&#39;s good  <br/>\nthat they love their dad too.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of times when they say things like, &quot;I wish Daddy were here  <br/>\ninstead of you,&quot; I&#39;ll just say, &quot;Sounds like you miss your dad,&quot; or,  <br/>\n&quot;I like it when David is here with us, too,&quot; or &quot;I miss him when he&#39;s  <br/>\nat work, too.&quot; Or I&#39;ll ask if they want to call him, or write him a  <br/>\nnote, or IM with him. Supporting that Daddy-love, because, really  <br/>\nthink about how great it is that my partner is so involved with them  <br/>\nthat they have developed those kinds of ties and feelings for him. I  <br/>\ncan see just in my circle of acquaintances that it&#39;s not true for a  <br/>\nlot of men.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m the mom. Of course they love me. They can&#39;t help it. What they say  <br/>\nin a cranky moment, or the awkward ways they express their feelings  <br/>\nfor their dad doesn&#39;t change that.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, it&#39;s easy for me to say this since they never carried  <br/>\nactually through with their death-plot.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu<br/>\n<br/>\nmom of Eric, 8; Carl; 5; Yehva, almost 2</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Daughter says she wants a new mommy","postDate":"1243027100","msgId":45474,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM2RUYxQjhBLTk4NEItNDIwNC05NzU3LTEzRTU1RjVBOUZCMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGd2NzNkbCs5cmdsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGd2NzNkbCs5cmdsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":45473,"nextInTopic":45475,"prevInTime":45473,"nextInTime":45475,"topicId":45473,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I m not really sure what to make of it.

Then she told me that she was the new nice mommy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not really sure what to make of it. I know it hurts my feelings and makes me want to cry.<br/>\nI&#39;ve come a very long way from the mother/parent I was 2 years ago. <br/>\nIt&#39;s still hard for me not to yell and snap at her. she&#39;s 4.5 and I&#39;m still working on bonding with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is something in the way I don&#39;t know what it is. I get so upset with myself for not being able to figure this out.<br/>\nI think it all started after the birth of our 2nd daughter. Our first was 2.5 at the time. She was very attached to me and called everyone mommy. I was the only one she wanted to go to sleep with at night.<br/>\nAfter her sister was born things changed, but I started wearing her sister so I could still interact with Nakiah the way i was before.<br/>\nSometimes it feels like Nakiah belongs to my husband and Ava belongs to me. I don&#39;t like that at all. My husband blows me off and says I&#39;m being silly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI long for my oldest to want and need me the way she used to. I know it won&#39;t be exactly the same because she&#39;s much older now, but I feel like she&#39;s rejecting me.<br/>\nThe only thing I can think of is that she feels rejected by me.<br/>\nI thought we were doing so well, but now I feel like there is a wall there and I don&#39;t know what to do.<br/>\nWe don&#39;t spank, stopped using timeouts a long time ago. <br/>\nI&#39;m jealous of the relationship my husband and daughter have. I want that with her! It&#39;s really breaking my heart.
