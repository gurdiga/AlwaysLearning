Those same “geniuses” might not be able to draw anything recognizeable, nor play an instrument or carry a tune, or run or do any martial arts of sports, or design and build anything at all.  In school, the kids who excell in “extra” things (music, art, sports) are often threatened with that being withheld if their math and English (science and history, maybe, which are other versions of math and English, in school) grades aren’t maintained.

(Sandra, in my head, from your stories I&#39;ve read, you are a playful, fun person) so I said, &quot;Hey, I didn&#39;t buy an iPad this week.

It’s HUGE evidence that all this generosity and abundance and providing of options, and of time to think, makes bigger changes than predicted even by unschoolers themselves.  It’s pretty surprising.  I was trying to buy Holly a new MacBook, and she talked me out of it.  After several hours of trying, and trying differently, I managed to upgrade her old one (my old one that she’s using) to the newest operating system, and she’s back in business.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen kids have turned down offers of equipment and help and cash, it makes it REALLY easy to say yes if they ask for something, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] 10 years in, unschooling works","postDate":"1465479278","msgId":77201,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJEREUxMDhGLTQ3NzEtNEFCQy04NkFDLUZGQTAxNEUwQTA4MUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDI2MjI0NTE5MS42MDYxMC4xNDY1NDY1ODQ4NTY5LkphdmFNYWlsLnlhaG9vQG1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PG5qOWZ2dCsxY2dpaGtwQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPDI2MjI0NTE5MS42MDYxMC4xNDY1NDY1ODQ4NTY5LkphdmFNYWlsLnlhaG9vQG1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":77200,"nextInTopic":77202,"prevInTime":77200,"nextInTime":77202,"topicId":77198,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- I think when the kids started it they saw it as a video game challenge.

Sometimes, on things like Treasure Math Storm, I would go in when they were asleep, crank the difficulty level up, and earn them some coins or whatever it was (I’ve forgotten) and then set the difficulty back down before anyone came back to it.

My son, 10, discovered he was really good at this kind of math-on-paper and raced ahead.  However when he got to the end of what was expected of him for his grade, he stopped.  &quot;That&#39;s enough for scoring high on the test. I just have to score what the other kids score.&quot; And he went back to gaming.  -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe effects of gaming, on my kids’ ability to judge the value of time and effort, has really impressed me.  I’m positive that their experience with games has helped them manage money better as adults.  They’re not going to “waste points” because of the time it took to make them.  And that translates to things like electric bills and bank accounts.  They’re also willing to spend money on comfort and entertainment.  They have a balanced but thoughtful attitude toward maintaining a living space.  All three have different experiences, continuing to unfold.  But I see choices like “That’s enough…” and moving to another activity in them, in practical, sensible ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] 10 years in, unschooling works","postDate":"1465478828","msgId":77200,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY5NTY2NDk1LTcyRDQtNENGNi05Q0NGLUE4RTMxNkE4Mjc1NkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDI2MjI0NTE5MS42MDYxMC4xNDY1NDY1ODQ4NTY5LkphdmFNYWlsLnlhaG9vQG1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PG5qOWZ2dCsxY2dpaGtwQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPDI2MjI0NTE5MS42MDYxMC4xNDY1NDY1ODQ4NTY5LkphdmFNYWlsLnlhaG9vQG1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":77199,"nextInTopic":77201,"prevInTime":77199,"nextInTime":77201,"topicId":77198,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- It was interesting to see how they might know adding fractions (from cooking, probably) but not know the word denominator.

Anyway, a few days of this prep and they would take the test and invariably do just fine and the aunts would relax.  -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Kirby was little, and was unschooling but the other two weren’t school-age yet (and we figured they might want to go to school, there was a game we played.  I called it “gambling.”  They brought pennies from their own money, or nickels and we’d do change.  I’d bring a bowl of pennies.  We played up on the big bed.   <br/>\n<br/>\nOH!  I wrote it up already, at some point and will quote it below with a link.<br/>\nI became really confident, from that game, that they were picking things up that neither I nor they were aware of.  Sometimes I would ask Holly first if I thought she might know, and if she missed, then Marty got a chance, and if Marty missed, Kirby could have it.  We discussed as much or as little as they wanted to, and pennies were exchanged, and they won, and we all knew more about each other.<br/>\n______<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my kids were little we played a game I called &quot;gambling.&quot; I wouldn&#39;t say &quot;Do you want to play that thing?&quot; I&#39;d say &quot;Let&#39;s gamble.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey had to have money to gamble, and so they&#39;d bring pennies and nickles and I would too, and we&#39;d have wooden bowls or some containers, and we&#39;d always play on my bed. I&#39;d get those sets of cards that are by grade and have school categories, and I&#39;d go to the next page every time (they&#39;re bound with one rivet/screw thing on one end) and choose one that would be a little hard but not impossible. Sometimes we used dice, but I never hesitated to skip one I knew was too hard, or to use a different category without announcing it. We&#39;d go through all the kids, usually youngest to oldest, but sometimes we&#39;d rotate, or I&#39;d offer it to the kid who hadn&#39;t won lately or who might know it because of some recent thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the kid knew it, he got a penny. If not, I got a penny. If it was unknowable because they&#39;d never ever heard of it, or if it was too hard, no pennies were exchanged. Great answers got two pennies. Pointing out a flaw in the question got a penny.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it was too hard I&#39;d explain briefly what the answer was and why. I&#39;d try to add one little bit of interesting info, but wouldn&#39;t make a lesson of it at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just played fast and for fun and there was a lot of laughter. Often there would be a globe on the bed, and a map and maybe a calculator or something else by the end of it, and when it stopped being fun for someone, we&#39;d all quit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey always won.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I always found out some things they knew that surprised me, and I was able to discover some things I might want to make more available to them. That&#39;s part of how I knew what to strew. I haven&#39;t told this story for a long time, maybe since before I was collecting web pages. I should put it out there...           See also strewing<br/>\n<br/>\nWe didn&#39;t go with the subject categories, but just randomized it all and treated it all like one giant category, mostly. I remember avoiding the spelling stuff, because even when they knew LOTS of math and geography and history, they still couldn&#39;t spell. When I was in school it was the other way for me.

We built\neach of the kids gaming computers, my daughter has always had high\nquality art supplies, we get things used and on sale, but if they ask\nfor something, I try to make it happen and, maybe as a result, the kids\nare super relaxed about stuff.&nbsp; I know a lot of parents who struggle so\nmuch with kids wanting and wanting and feeling like they (the parents)\n&quot;have to&quot; say no no no all the time, that they won&#39;t even go into toy\nstores with their kids, etc.&nbsp; &quot;On your birthday&quot; or &quot;with your\nallowance&quot; or &quot;no, that&#39;s not educational&quot; or &quot;if I get you that then I\nhave to get your sibling something too,&quot; or whatever the limitation is.&nbsp;\n We haven&#39;t had that.&nbsp; If one of my kids comes up with something they\nreally want, it&#39;s cool with the other kid if they get it.&nbsp; They don&#39;t\nwant random stuff, they seem to pursue their interests.&nbsp; They hardly\never ask for anything.&nbsp; I often offer.&nbsp; They have difficulty at\nChristmas thinking of things to ask for because they feel pretty good\nwith what they&#39;ve got.&nbsp; When my son read the Harry Pottery scene about\nthe mirror that shows you your biggest desire he said, &quot;I can&#39;t imagine\nwhat would be in the mirror for me.&nbsp; I guess I&#39;m pretty happy.&quot;&nbsp; !!!&nbsp;\nThat&#39;s pure mothering gold right there.<br clear=\"none\"><br clear=\"none\"></div>So.&nbsp; As part of my\ndaughter&#39;s studio classes, she lugs a computer, tablet, stylus, etc, to do\nher work, and I was reading about the new iPad pro and Pencil and how\nmuch the tech has advanced.&nbsp; I wondered if it might be a better option\nfor her, plus she could work anywhere, instead of being tied to the\ndesktop.&nbsp; This week we went to the apple store and she gave it a long\ntry.&nbsp; It&#39;s very cool!&nbsp; But in the end,\nshe said, no, she likes her set up better.&nbsp; Maybe in another year or two\n when the tech was better, she said.<br clear=\"none\"><br clear=\"none\"></div>I was floored\n(quietly, to myself).&nbsp; I was ready to pull the trigger on an 12 inch\nipad pro for her (with money squirreled away for the last year!) and she\n assessed it, coolly and methodically, and said no thanks, not yet, I\nlike what I&#39;ve got.&nbsp; So we left and strolled around.&nbsp; The whole thing\nwas very relaxed.&nbsp; We have friends with kids who are highly controlled\nabout &quot;screentime&quot; and starved for gaming or tablets, who want to play\non ours when they come over, etc, leading to some weird behavior\nsometimes.&nbsp; And my kid just easily walked away from having an ipad of\nher own.&nbsp; &quot;Maybe next year. What I&#39;ve got is working for me right now.&quot;&nbsp;\n Sooo not spoiled.&nbsp; Unschooling, yay!<br clear=\"none\"><br clear=\"none\"></div><div>I&#39;ll finish with this funny from last night.&nbsp; Ever since they were\nlittle...it started as a joke but became just how we do things--they get\n their own grocery carts (used to be those little ones) and put in things they\nwant.&nbsp; It&#39;s their bodies, they should eat what they want, I mean, I don&#39;t want \n\nanyone telling me what to eat, that&#39;s for damn sure.&nbsp; The limitation is\nmy budget.&nbsp; So I might say, &quot;we can&#39;t afford two cheeses, just\none,&quot; or, &quot;let&#39;s wait for that to go on sale,&quot; or, &quot;get a smaller size\nof that,&quot; or &quot;ice cream or cookies, not both, this time, I&#39;m broke.&quot;&nbsp;\nThey seem to get this, no worries, they&#39;ll get whatever it is next time.\n <br clear=\"none\"><br clear=\"none\">Other times I&#39;m flush and we have a feast of favorites.&nbsp; Last\nnight, we were at the pizza place with all those fancy &#39;by the slice&#39;\npizzas behind glass and the kids could not decide, and could not\ndecide.&nbsp; I was hungry and grumpy and getting snappish.&nbsp; But I think of\nthe &quot;choose two options&quot; thing. I could walk them out of there in a\nhuff, I could choose for them, I could breathe and be patient, I could\norder my own now and they could order when they were ready--and each option\nis getting better, yes?&nbsp; Then I think, my standby, what would Sandra do?\n (Sandra, in my head, from your stories I&#39;ve read, you are a playful,\nfun person) so I said, &quot;Hey, I didn&#39;t buy an iPad this week.&nbsp; Lets get\none slice of each and make up a whole pizza of different slices.&quot; And my\n daughter looks up at me and sings in full-on Bette Midler, &quot;Did you\never know that you&#39;re my hero...?&quot; We were cracking up SO HARD.&nbsp; That\nmoment came directly from reading this list. <br clear=\"none\"></div><div><br clear=\"none\"></div>I just\nam so grateful.&nbsp; We all have so much fun together.&nbsp; I did not know how\nto do any of this, or be the person who could be their mother in this\nway, before I found you all.&nbsp; Sandra, Joyce, Pam, Deb, Alex, Diana, Rue,\nSchuyler, many others.&nbsp; There have been so many points of learning for\nme and changing old thought patterns. One from Joyce that has been a\ncontinual compass is &quot;how would I feel about my marriage if my husband\nsaid that to me or treated me this way [that I am about to do/say to my\nkids]?&quot; If the answer isn&#39;t <i>wonderful and close</i>, then don&#39;t do\nit. That one almost always clears the un-thoughtful, junk behavior out,\nhaha. My daughter said recently, &quot;I&#39;m so glad I don&#39;t have to fight with\n my mom the way [her friend] does. They seem so unhappy.&quot;&nbsp; WOW.&nbsp; I mean,\n we DO fight, usually about space because we live in a very small house\nand can get on each others nerves.&nbsp; But its okay, we work it out.&nbsp; <br clear=\"none\"><br clear=\"none\">So\n anyway, thank you all, very much. I&#39;ve been learning at your feet for\nten years.&nbsp; It&#39;s been really really worth the time and the personal\nchallenge to become a person my kids might actually think a valuable\nfriend when they are independent (and happy, I hope) adults and\ndon&#39;t need me anymore.<br clear=\"none\"><br clear=\"none\"></div>Lurker extraordinaire, Maya<p><span><br clear=\"none\"

Have I gone off the path?&quot; (Said a\n bit tongue in cheek, but I *was* thinking about it daily.)&nbsp; I think when \nthe kids started it they saw it as a video game challenge.&nbsp; Do these \nquests (math puzzles), get the reward (high score/aunt fun).&nbsp; I tried to\n keep my mouth shut and just help when asked.&nbsp; I also reminded them if \nthey were busy with other things, &quot;if you want to work on test prep, do \nit now, we&#39;ll be out all afternoon....&quot; that sort of thing, but no pressure.<br><br>It \nwas interesting to see how it played out.&nbsp; My son, 10, discovered he was\n really good at this kind of math-on-paper and raced ahead.&nbsp; However \nwhen he got to the end of what was expected of him for his grade, he \nstopped.&nbsp; &quot;That&#39;s enough for scoring high on the test. I just have to \nscore what the other kids score.&quot; And he went back to gaming.&nbsp; <br><br>My\n daughter, 12, on the other hand, discovered she had to really \nstruggle.&nbsp; It did not come easily and she had to repeat videos over and \nover to get it.&nbsp; I told her maybe she ought to just let it go, I could \ntalk to the aunts to get them off her back.&nbsp; She might find it all much \neasier in a few years, if she was interested then.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t want her to\n start feeling stupid, especially with her younger brother sailing past \nher.&nbsp; She is an amazing digital artist, works in\n a studio with adult artists, assistant teaches aikido to the younger \nkids class at her dojo, plays complex instrumental guitar by ear, can \nrun a 5k in 20 minutes, reads adult SF novels for fun--heck, last month \nshe designed and built a steampunk, Victorian dress out of trash and \nmodeled it on an 80 foot runway for a local gallery &quot;trashion show&quot;.&nbsp; \nShe is anything but stupid.&nbsp; But she was hitting a wall with this.&nbsp; Her \napproach to anything hard, however, ever since she was little, is to put\n her head down and bull her way through, so she did that for a while.&nbsp; \nGrinding ahead on Kahn Academy.&nbsp; I was both impressed and kind of \nworried.&nbsp; But she said, &quot;I&#39;m not stupid enough to think I&#39;m stupid \nbecause of math.&quot; Right.<br><br></div>So, we did this for a couple of \nweeks and then they (first my son, then my daughter) said they were \ndone.&nbsp; Time to take the test.&nbsp; Which they did.&nbsp; Then we went swimming.&nbsp; <br><br></div>I&#39;m\n telling all of this to say that it seems to me that it isn&#39;t the \nactivity (doing written math on Kahn Academy) that defines unschooling, \nor breaks it.&nbsp; It&#39;s where the activity is coming from (the kids) and for\n what reason (their own, personal motivation), and how it feels between \nthe parents and kids.&nbsp; I never would have thought we&#39;d be &quot;doing math&quot; \nbut there we were.&nbsp; And then they were done with it.&nbsp; Maybe they&#39;ll do \nmore like this next year at test time.&nbsp; Maybe they won&#39;t.<br><br></div>The\n results this year were about what we expected. Both kids read at high \nschool level (whatever that means), son is in the 90+ percentile in \nmath, daughter is 50%.&nbsp; She was surprised, given how much she struggled,\n that she was still right in the middle.&nbsp; This with zero reading \ninstruction ever (excepting that I have already read/spelled anything \nthey wanted me to) and a couple weeks of math on Kahn academy.&nbsp; Another \nyear free!&nbsp; So far, unschooling works, for us anyway.<br><br></div>The second story is shorter,\n sorry this post is so long.&nbsp; We don&#39;t have a lot of money but within \nour abilities I&#39;ve always pretty much bought the kids whatever they \nwanted. I know parents who would cringe at that statement and worry \nabout &quot;spoiling&quot; them.&nbsp; But that hasn&#39;t been my experience. We built \neach of the kids gaming computers, my daughter has always had high \nquality art supplies, we get things used and on sale, but if they ask \nfor something, I try to make it happen and, maybe as a result, the kids \nare super relaxed about stuff.&nbsp; I know a lot of parents who struggle so \nmuch with kids wanting and wanting and feeling like they (the parents) \n&quot;have to&quot; say no no no all the time, that they won&#39;t even go into toy \nstores with their kids, etc.&nbsp; &quot;On your birthday&quot; or &quot;with your \nallowance&quot; or &quot;no, that&#39;s not educational&quot; or &quot;if I get you that then I \nhave to get your sibling something too,&quot; or whatever the limitation is.&nbsp;\n We haven&#39;t had that.&nbsp; If one of my kids comes up with something they \nreally want, it&#39;s cool with the other kid if they get it.&nbsp; They don&#39;t \nwant random stuff, they seem to pursue their interests.&nbsp; They hardly \never ask for anything.&nbsp; I often offer.&nbsp; They have difficulty at \nChristmas thinking of things to ask for because they feel pretty good \nwith what they&#39;ve got.&nbsp; When my son read the Harry Pottery scene about \nthe mirror that shows you your biggest desire he said, &quot;I can&#39;t imagine \nwhat would be in the mirror for me.&nbsp; I guess I&#39;m pretty happy.&quot;&nbsp; !!!&nbsp; \nThat&#39;s pure mothering gold right there.<br><br></div>So.&nbsp; As part of my \ndaughter&#39;s studio classes, she lugs a computer, tablet, stylus, etc, to do \nher work, and I was reading about the new iPad pro and Pencil and how \nmuch the tech has advanced.&nbsp; I wondered if it might be a better option \nfor her, plus she could work anywhere, instead of being tied to the \ndesktop.&nbsp; This week we went to the apple store and she gave it a long \ntry.&nbsp; It&#39;s very cool!&nbsp; But in the end, \nshe said, no, she likes her set up better.&nbsp; Maybe in another year or two\n when the tech was better, she said.<br><br></div>I was floored \n(quietly, to myself).&nbsp; I was ready to pull the trigger on an 12 inch \nipad pro for her (with money squirreled away for the last year!) and she\n assessed it, coolly and methodically, and said no thanks, not yet, I \nlike what I&#39;ve got.&nbsp; So we left and strolled around.&nbsp; The whole thing \nwas very relaxed.&nbsp; We have friends with kids who are highly controlled \nabout &quot;screentime&quot; and starved for gaming or tablets, who want to play \non ours when they come over, etc, leading to some weird behavior \nsometimes.&nbsp; And my kid just easily walked away from having an ipad of \nher own.&nbsp; &quot;Maybe next year. What I&#39;ve got is working for me right now.&quot;&nbsp;\n Sooo not spoiled.&nbsp; Unschooling, yay!<br><br></div><div>I&#39;ll finish with this funny from last night.&nbsp; Ever since they were \nlittle...it started as a joke but became just how we do things--they get\n their own grocery carts (used to be those little ones) and put in things they \nwant.&nbsp; It&#39;s their bodies, they should eat what they want, I mean, I don&#39;t want \nanyone telling me what to eat, that&#39;s for damn sure.&nbsp; The limitation is \nmy budget.&nbsp; So I might say, &quot;we can&#39;t afford two cheeses, just \none,&quot; or, &quot;let&#39;s wait for that to go on sale,&quot; or, &quot;get a smaller size \nof that,&quot; or &quot;ice cream or cookies, not both, this time, I&#39;m broke.&quot;&nbsp; \nThey seem to get this, no worries, they&#39;ll get whatever it is next time.\n <br><br>Other times I&#39;m flush and we have a feast of favorites.&nbsp; Last \nnight, we were at the pizza place with all those fancy &#39;by the slice&#39; \npizzas behind glass and the kids could not decide, and could not \ndecide.&nbsp; I was hungry and grumpy and getting snappish.&nbsp; But I think of \nthe &quot;choose two options&quot; thing. I could walk them out of there in a \nhuff, I could choose for them, I could breathe and be patient, I could \norder my own now and they could order when they were ready--and each option \nis getting better, yes?&nbsp; Then I think, my standby, what would Sandra do?\n (Sandra, in my head, from your stories I&#39;ve read, you are a playful, \nfun person) so I said, &quot;Hey, I didn&#39;t buy an iPad this week.&nbsp; Lets get \none slice of each and make up a whole pizza of different slices.&quot; And my\n daughter looks up at me and sings in full-on Bette Midler, &quot;Did you \never know that you&#39;re my hero...?&quot; We were cracking up SO HARD.&nbsp; That \nmoment came directly from reading this list. <br></div><div><br></div>I just \nam so grateful.&nbsp; We all have so much fun together.&nbsp; I did not know how \nto do any of this, or be the person who could be their mother in this \nway, before I found you all.&nbsp; Sandra, Joyce, Pam, Deb, Alex, Diana, Rue, \nSchuyler, many others.&nbsp; There have been so many points of learning for \nme and changing old thought patterns. One from Joyce that has been a \ncontinual compass is &quot;how would I feel about my marriage if my husband \nsaid that to me or treated me this way [that I am about to do/say to my \nkids]?&quot; If the answer isn&#39;t <i>wonderful and close</i>, then don&#39;t do \nit. That one almost always clears the un-thoughtful, junk behavior out, \nhaha. My daughter said recently, &quot;I&#39;m so glad I don&#39;t have to fight with\n my mom the way [her friend] does. They seem so unhappy.&quot;&nbsp; WOW.&nbsp; I mean,\n we DO fight, usually about space because we live in a very small house \nand can get on each others nerves.&nbsp; But its okay, we work it out.&nbsp; <br><br>So\n anyway, thank you all, very much. I&#39;ve been learning at your feet for \nten years.&nbsp; It&#39;s been really really worth the time and the personal \nchallenge to become a person my kids might actually think a valuable \nfriend when they are independent (and happy, I hope) adults and \ndon&#39;t need me anymore.<br><br></div>Lurker extraordinaire, Maya<p><span><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-814294474yui-cursor\"></span></p></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77149,"nextTopicId":77206}}
