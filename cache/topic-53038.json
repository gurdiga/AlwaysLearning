That&#39;s approximately double the time that the &quot;average child&quot; spends watching tv daily, according to the professor quoted in the article. Pfft, what a double standard.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many things a person could spend all day doing that required minimal physical exertion, but it&#39;s always tv and video games that get the bad rap. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child came home from school and read for four hours instead of watching tv for four hours, that&#39;s considered acceptable -- even though reading isn&#39;t any more physically exerting than watching tv. (The irony is that some kids do come home and spend a crazy amount of time doing homework -- something that requires minimal physical exertion.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===2. Mindless TV-watching allows all sorts of images and values I don&#39;t necessarily endorse into my home. &lt;snip&gt; Leaving the tv on means having very little control of what information is infiltrated into your four walls.===<br/>\n<br/>\nI disagree. I like having the tv on in the background when I&#39;m doing things around the house or in my office. Sometimes, like today, it&#39;s on all day, but I&#39;m *always* aware of what&#39;s on -- and it&#39;s never anything I would be horrified for my son to walk in and see if I&#39;m not in the room -- Food Network, HGTV, Discovery Channel, History Channel, and USA Network. If my son has the tv on in the background while he&#39;s doing something else, he has it on channels he enjoys -- Nick, Cartoon Network, and Disney Channel. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t understand the statement that leaving the tv on means having very little control over what info &quot;infiltrates&quot; my house -- like all of a sudden my tv takes control over itself and changes to trashy shows and forces my son to watch them and zaps me if I try to change the channel or turn off the tv??? Good grief.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===3. Keeping TV watching down to a minimal level means that when it&#39;s on, it&#39;s quality. &lt;snip&gt; Watching tv as a family for four hours per week, instead of 28, means that those four hours are much more meaningful.===<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, maybe it&#39;s something the parent considers quality but the kids would rather take a pass on if they had the choice. Someone mentioned in the unschooling chat yesterday that her daughter&#39;s boyfriend was required to watch tv with his dad on Sunday nights -- the dad deems obviously deems it quality viewing, but does his son? <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think that more tv viewing equates to it being less meaningful. Andrew rarely watches tv anymore, but when he was a bit  younger we watched it a lot of some days -- we&#39;d have marathon viewings of whatever his favorite series&#39; were. That time was just as meaningful to him and me as it would&#39;ve been if we&#39;d only watched 15 or 30 minutes of tv that day.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===4. It&#39;s more peaceful, relaxing, and less stressful when the TV is off by default.===<br/>\n<br/>\nIt depends on what&#39;s on the tv. I never watch news channels or talk shows because I personally find those stressful and as far from peaceful as you can get. No matter which channel we watch, when commercials come on the volume gets muted or turned way down -- we don&#39;t mind doing that (I find commercials on the radio equally as annoying). There are certain channels that are very relaxing for me to watch -- Food Network, Travel Channel, HGTV; hubby finds History Channel very relaxing. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are times I want quiet and the tv off, but there are times when I don&#39;t want the house totally quiet so I choose to have the tv on something that is relaxing for me to watch or have on in the background.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===5. There are simply other fun things to do.===<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, there are plenty of fun things to do, many that don&#39;t involve the tv at all! But it doesn&#39;t have to be either-or kind of thing. Andrew and I embarked upon many a role-playing adventures after watching an episode of Pokemon or Digimon!! Even though he came up with his own ideas when we played with those action figures, he also liked drawing inspiration from the tv shows. <br/>\n<br/>\nI find Food Network to be a frequent source of inspiration. Duff Goldman of Ace of Cakes (on Food Network) is a great example of someone who took something they enjoyed doing and going outside the box with how they used it, and creating a successful business because of it. Instead of hiring a bunch of folks trained as cake decorators, he hired friends with artistic backgrounds . . . and it shows in their cakes! They make some truly amazing stuff, and they inspire kids and adults, alike.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===Why would I trade watching someone else&#39;s (fake) life for living out my own?=== (quote from the article these &quot;5 great reasons&quot; came from)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe article&#39;s author has obviously not watched &quot;Glee&quot; or &quot;LOST&quot; [g]. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I&#39;m watching tv while I&#39;m doing needlework or cooking or paying bills, I am definitely living my own life.

At the end of the commercial it says &quot;T.V. can be a child&#39;s window to the world&quot;.  Of course it doesn&#39;t say all t.v. as it is a plug for PBS, but I like it nonetheless.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe reasons stated below for limiting t.v. are pure rubbish in my book and just reiterate what every other anti-t.v. group/person/study is spouting nowdays.  I&#39;m to the point now that I read stuff like that and just shake my head because my family has already disproved every single one of the anti-t.v. aruguments (maybe not everyone because my children aren&#39;t to adulthood yet, but you get the drift).  As far as limiting ones world and only calling certain shows &quot;quality&quot;, that&#39;s the same as only labeling certain toys &quot;educational&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy house is more peaceful when my kids are able to pursue what interests them without judgement.  I know I wouldn&#39;t feel very peaceful inside if I was made to feel like my interests didn&#39;t matter because they didn&#39;t coincide with what my parents deemed &quot;quality&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of other fun things to do in addition to watching t.v., that doesn&#39;t mean that watching t.v. is less fun though, it&#39;s just something else to do, another choice if you will in the wide world of choices unschoolers get to choose from.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaking an analogy from the book &#39;Peace Begins With You&#39;:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen one side wins (the mother/father who have control of the t.v.) and one side loses (the child who can&#39;t choose what he wants to watch on t.v.) that isn&#39;t peace.  When one side gets what they want or need (the mother/father who gets to make the choice) and the other (the child) gives up trying because &quot;those are the rules&quot;, that is not peace.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA quote from the book:<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;Everybody is different.  They want and need different things, in different places at different times in their lives.  Peace is being allowed to be different-and letting others be different from you.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOur children are their own people, they have different likes, dislikes & tastes than us.  For us to put our own wants and intersts onto someone else is just plain wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren that are free to have their own minds and their own interests allow others to have their own minds and their own interests.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJulie v.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lerendzonderschool.blogspot.com\">http://www.lerendzonderschool.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;indywhited&quot; &lt;indywhited@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://simplemom.net/5-great-reasons-to-not-watch-much-tv/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+simplemom+%28Simple+Mom%29\">http://simplemom.net/5-great-reasons-to-not-watch-much-tv/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+simplemom+%28Simple+Mom%29</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1.

(Just for the<br/>\nrecord, I don&#39;t completely agree with any of these, but they were<br/>\ninteresting to read about.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   - Kids who watch informative and educational shows as preschoolers tend<br/>\n   to watch more informative and educational shows when they get older.  They<br/>\n   use TV effectively as a complement to school learning.  On the other hand,<br/>\n   kids who watch more entertainment program watch fewer informative programs<br/>\n   as they get older  (Macbeth, 1996).<br/>\n   - Preschoolers who viewed educational programs tend to have higher<br/>\n   grades, are less aggressive and value their studies more when they reach<br/>\n   high school, according to a long-term study (Anderson, et. al, 2001).<br/>\n   - Finally, scientists from the University of Siena found that children<br/>\n   experience a soothing, painkilling effect by watching cartoons.  So perhaps,<br/>\n   a little entertainment TV can be a source of relief to kids who are stressed<br/>\n   or are in pain.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nJean Elizabeth<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://3mommies.blogspot.com\">http://3mommies.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":299860577,"authorName":"indywhited","from":"&quot;indywhited&quot; &lt;indywhited@...&gt;","profile":"indywhited","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"5 Great Reasons to Not Watch (much) TV","postDate":"1271715178","msgId":53038,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhxaWtoYStzZmxoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":53052,"prevInTime":53037,"nextInTime":53039,"topicId":53038,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"http://simplemom.net/5-great-reasons-to-not-watch-much-tv/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+simplemom+%28Simple+Mom%29 1.
