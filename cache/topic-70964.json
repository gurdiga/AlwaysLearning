Background: My children (now 6 and almost 8) have been allowed to choose what they want to eat since they started eating solid food.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis story was relayed to me from my husband and children. About 1 year ago three siblings of a student of mine went to play with my children during a lesson. (these kids were about 9, 6 and 4). In the playroom the children found one of those M&M containers that have a little character and a fan on them.  I have no idea how long that had been sitting there, as although my children like M&Ms they had asked for this because of the little character and fan.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of visiting children opened the tube and M&Ms went all over the floor.  My children stood there as the three children (who I found out later were not allowed candy) dove on the floor and began eating the M&Ms as fast as they could. <br/>\n<br/>\nA very similar scenario happened as well a few weeks agodifferent location and food, but similar. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t a discussion on what kinds of food can be considered nutritious or not.  It is about the freedom of being able to choose what we put in our own bodies.  Children may not understand that a green cupcake is not as nutritious as a green vegetable, but by limiting the green cupcake we have made it more desirable than the vegetable. <br/>\n<br/>\nComing from someone who had strict limitations on everything growing up, I feel good that my children already at this age do not have to grow up fighting food, or anything else because they are already more in control than I am at 41. <br/>\n<br/>\nRachael, Shaun, Kean (my carnivore) and Kai (who lives off fruit and veggies by choiceoh, and chocolate too)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70947,"nextTopicId":70870}}
