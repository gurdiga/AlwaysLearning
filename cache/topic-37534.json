She is more than content to re-read every Warriors book written , delve into","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-978023316\">My 13 yo daughter has been experiencing the same thing in the last  <br/>\nyear or so. She is more than content to re-read every Warriors book  <br/>\nwritten &lt;g&gt;, delve into other books that have been on her shelf and  <br/>\nplay on the computer. She plays WoW and is on deviantART, so connects  <br/>\nwith friends on-line.<br/>\n<br/>\nI noticed a couple of years ago that she was less interested in  <br/>\n&quot;getting out&quot; to homeschool-group events, so we stopped. I also  <br/>\nnoticed that sometimes, even when she said she wanted to go, and I  <br/>\nfollowed through with tickets or arrangements, she would want to bail  <br/>\nat the last minute. So, since then, I have offered up things to do  <br/>\nwith and without friends. I mention possibilities more than once, but  <br/>\nunless I see that light of excitement in her eyes, I don&#39;t assume I  <br/>\nshould nail it down.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say (and so would she) that she&#39;s happier on her own at home.  <br/>\nShe can be who she is, grow at her own pace, and do the things she  <br/>\nloves. She enjoys her friends generally one at a time (so I do my best  <br/>\nto facilitate that) and those who share her interests, but also looks  <br/>\nforward to our regional unschooling conference, in spite of the  <br/>\nheightened energy. As she gets older, I see that she&#39;s growing into  <br/>\nherself, being more comfortable with who she is, understanding herself  <br/>\nbetter.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she was little, she would remove herself from situations that  <br/>\noverwhelmed her. Then she went through a long period of seeking out  <br/>\nstimulation (or at least not avoiding it) with not-so-great  <br/>\nconsequences for her or people around her. This happens less and less,  <br/>\nbut there are times still when she doesn&#39;t want to leave what&#39;s  <br/>\nhappening, then she&#39;ll become angry and frustrated. I realize that I  <br/>\nneeded to be more sensitive to this and not schlep us to so many  <br/>\nactivities. It can be a tightrope for us, because things can go off  <br/>\nthe rails, even when it&#39;s somewhere she *really* wants to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe seems to know, even more so in the last few months, that when  <br/>\nthings get overwhelming for her, she needs to get away from what&#39;s  <br/>\nhappening. At the most recent conference, she often went back to the  <br/>\nroom to play her DS, or watch her Inuyasha DVDs, so she could get some  <br/>\nspace to calm down. She has the qualities of an introvert (needs lots  <br/>\nof down time, gets her energy sucked out by too much excitement or  <br/>\ndissonance), but can enjoy social time, too. A bit like her mum and  <br/>\ndad &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs she gets older, she&#39;s been able to articulate what&#39;s going on for  <br/>\nher, too. We had a spell in which we had friends (whom we love dearly)  <br/>\ncome and stay for two days/nights at a time, within a week of each  <br/>\nother. She told me that much as she cares for these friends, she was  <br/>\nonly able to handle one day/night visit at a time per week. So, that&#39;s  <br/>\nfiled for future reference. She is thinking ahead as to what might  <br/>\nhappen, is willing to try things, but also able to tell me how it went  <br/>\nand how she sees things going next time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have worried that I wasn&#39;t providing &quot;enough&quot; of whatever for her,  <br/>\nbut she&#39;s happy! And when she&#39;s not happy, it doesn&#39;t take long for  <br/>\nher to get over it, since she&#39;s at home where she&#39;s loved and given  <br/>\nspace to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your daughter is content, that&#39;s great. By all means, offer up  <br/>\nideas, especially ones that segue with her current passions, like  <br/>\nrenting &quot;Golden Compass&quot; or going to see other animal-focused movies,  <br/>\nchecking out some new computer games (does she know about the Warriors  <br/>\nsite?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.warriorcats.com/warriorshell.html\">http://www.warriorcats.com/warriorshell.html</a>  There are lots of  <br/>\nWarriors fans on deviantART, too <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.deviantart.com/\">http://www.deviantart.com/</a> <br/>\n#catpath=fanart&order=9&q=warrior+cats), trips to the zoo. But don&#39;t  <br/>\nmake it necessarily a friend-related trip, just for the purpose of  <br/>\nconnecting her with her friends. She may really be wanting to  <br/>\nexperience things on her own, or with you or the family.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin B.<br/>\n<br/>\nI<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Aug 25, 2008, at 9:49 PM, klybowen wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been unschooling for a year now.
