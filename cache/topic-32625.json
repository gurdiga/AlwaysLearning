I know from experience<br/>\n&gt;  and from reading other people&#39;s experiences that a lot of dads (and<br/>\n&gt;  moms) get nervous about schooly stuff somewhere in the mid elementary<br/>\n&gt;  years. I think this is due to the fact that school kids start to<br/>\n&gt;  veer off in a very different direction than an unschooled child. It<br/>\n&gt;  starts to become more noticable that what your unschooled child is<br/>\n&gt;  doing. What an unschooled child is doing, is really really different<br/>\n&gt;  than what a schooled child is doing.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  You didn&#39;t really give a lot of information, so I&#39;ll go on<br/>\n&gt;  assumptions here. If the above is the case, the best thing you can<br/>\n&gt;  do for your kids and your husband is to really focus on &quot;seeing&quot; the<br/>\n&gt;  learning that goes on in your everyday life.

It will look very very different, there is no way around<br/>\n&gt;  that. Scope and sequence is all about keeping kids on a certain<br/>\n&gt;  knoweldge based time frame and unschooling is about letting that time<br/>\n&gt;  frame go and knowing that knowledge is intrinsic to the learner.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  People who aren&#39;t unschooling and have no concept of it, get worried<br/>\n&gt;  about wether or not a child knows their times tables at the age of 9<br/>\n&gt;  or that a child isn&#39;t reading by the age of 6 or 7.
