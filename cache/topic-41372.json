I am definitly seeing his<br/>\n*interruptions* differently. I changed how I was thinking and I<br/>\ndecided to welcome them and because of that I am feeling more joyful.<br/>\nI love him so much and he is so happy talking to me, i am lucky that<br/>\nhe wants to share with me.

So much so, my hubby, peeping over <br/>\nmy shoulder, reading, thought it was a post from me!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy solution, in the beginning, was to just forget about doing <br/>\nreading, watching tv or internet, no point for i will only be <br/>\ninterrupted again, and again and again LOL! <br/>\n<br/>\nI just stay with DS, and use his enthusiasm to do things together. <br/>\nIf I have to do any cooking(if i ran out of my freezer stash), i <br/>\ninvite him to join in. If he is not interested, then everytime he <br/>\nsays &quot;look at this, look at that&quot;, i just say come and show me here <br/>\nin the kitchen, if he says &quot;i can&#39;t&quot;, then I&#39;ll say &quot;wait a minute, <br/>\ni&#39;m in midst of cooking, will be with you in 10 or 15 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI only catch up on what i wanna do, when hubby gets home and takes <br/>\nover with showering DS and pjs and quite frequently, bedtime stories <br/>\ntoo. So i either be going to bed at 7pm to read, or stay downstairs <br/>\nand watch tv on my own.    <br/>\n<br/>\nDS soon got out of this mode, and I had the chance again to get on <br/>\nwith my daily routine. But sometimes, it happens again, but this <br/>\ntime, I find that i can sit next to him, reading and pay attention <br/>\nto whatever he wants me to see. If the interuption gets too much, i <br/>\njust forget my reading and join his games. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the loud night time playing, we have yet figure out a <br/>\nsolution LOL! Tried getting DS to put on his headphone but he <br/>\ncomplains it&#39;s uncomfortable. Frankly speaking, it only bothers <br/>\nhubby, so am considering getting hubby the headphones for the tv <br/>\ninstead. Presently, DS is playing his Nintendo or psp on low volume, <br/>\nwhile hubby watches tv on a reasonable volume, with me in the middle <br/>\ntyping on the laptop.

I still only tend","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-914465629\">I didn&#39;t read for years after having Simon and Linnaea. That&#39;s not true. I didn&#39;t read much for a long time after having Simon and Linnaea. I still only tend to read at bedtime or on the toilet. It isn&#39;t because I don&#39;t like reading, it&#39;s because reading takes a bubble that I have to live in for a little while to get back into a book. It helps for me to reread books that I know fairly well and enjoy as I can pick them up and walk away from them with greater ease than books that are new to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you don&#39;t really want to hear that, though. You want to hear that it is perfectly reasonable for you to have an uninterupted 20 minutes here and there. I&#39;ve found that the more I feel like I deserve something, the more I feel that it is perfectly reasonable for me to have 20 minutes uninterupted to myself, the less likely it seems to be that it will happen. It&#39;s all perspective. The more I can relax and let it be good to hang out, all the time, with Simon and Linnaea, the more I can embrace sitting with them and watching them play Halo 3 or playing Goblet or building towers or making a tuna sandwich or whatever it is, the less taxing the interruptions seem to be. And then, suddenly, my time is less required. Not always, not that I can take 20 minutes whenever I want, but somehow when I relax into being there and with them whenever they ask and more than just when they ask, when I am generous with me, I seem to get time to just do stuff.<br/>\n It&#39;s like I fill their cups and they can go for longer without needing my presence. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, it&#39;s even more amazing then that. My back went out earlier this month and I&#39;ve been hobbling around. And they cater to me. When I was really in pain and having trouble getting up from the couch, Simon was fetching the hot sock (a sock filled with dried beans that holds lovely heat when microwaved) and bringing it to me every time he thought of it. Linnaea was getting me drinks and food and the remote and their generosity was astounding. <br/>\n<br/>\nI love when they bounce into the room really excited and want to have me see the new thing, the old thing, the thing that they are bouncing about. I love being given that gift. It&#39;s so much better than another chapter of a book, an uninterrupted episode of Ray Mears Extreme Survival, or whatever. Someday they won&#39;t be in my home. Someday they will have a life that isn&#39;t so much about sharing with me. So loving it now is really important. Really important. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: troubadour4me &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ronniegreek@...\">ronniegreek@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Tuesday, 13 January, 2009 2:50:58 AM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] constant Interruptions to be accepted?<br/>\n<br/>\nHey everyone, I will try to get my question out with a few common<br/>\nexamples of everyday life and I would like to see how others here<br/>\n*deal* with this.<br/>\nToday: Lukas and I head out for town stopping to get him some food he<br/>\nwants,then we go to a game store then visit my Dad.
