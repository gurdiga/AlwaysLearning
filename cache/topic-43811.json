I know a lot of kids who are mean sometimes.  So when does a parent know that her child is a particular menace that warrants protecting the world?  When we let our kids out into the world - parks, parties, sports, etc. - do we really all know that they will not say or do anything unkind?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying this defensively.  It&#39;s something I&#39;ve struggled with.  What can we expect the world to &quot;take.&quot;  What do we have an obligation to protect others&#39; from?  And what about the fact that many people can handle things, and some people are more sensitive to things?  How do we know that this kid in particular, or this mom, in this soccer case, aren&#39;t very sheltered and sensitive?  I&#39;m totally not saying anything he said was OK, I&#39;m just saying, wondering...we can&#39;t always judge the appropriateness of our kids behaviors by others&#39; reactions to them.  I mean, if I took a poll of the kids, or was able to hear everything they all say to each other, what if I found that most people didn&#39;t care what Jesse said, and that, in fact, a number of the kids talk like that,  would I then be OK letting him play on the team?  I&#39;m not asking these things literally, but just trying to explain how challenging it would be to know when to intercede, and how far to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;The role of reminder&quot; implies that the problem goes on and on and on  <br/>\n&gt; and on the same way, with the parent giving the same reminders over  <br/>\n&gt; and over and over and over.  Part of being genuine is finding words to  <br/>\n&gt; say that communicate what the problem is and WHY it needs to stop, and  <br/>\n&gt; what the parent will change until it does stop.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have done all this, the explaining, etc.., but where I am stuck is this part:  &quot;and  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; what the parent will change until it does stop. &quot;  Since we did away with punishment a few years ago, there are times when all the environmental manipulation (not taking him to such and such place), the talking, the listening, just haven&#39;t fixed things, and I&#39;m left not knowing what else I can do. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; If I had a best friend who said  things like &quot;Duh,&quot; &quot;Shut the frick  <br/>\n&gt; up,&quot; &quot;You&#39;re fat,&quot; &quot;Stupid lady,&quot; or  &quot;You&#39;re such an idiot,&quot;  I  <br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t meet them in public for lunch, and I wouldn&#39;t invite other  <br/>\n&gt; people over to hang out at the same time, but it&#39;s not a good  <br/>\n&gt; example.  I wouldn&#39;t HAVE a friend who said things like that<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nor would I.  Don&#39;t get that choice here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;not  <br/>\n&gt; without me saying clearly and unequivocably that she needed to STOP  <br/>\n&gt; being that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not saying this provocatively, Sandra, I&#39;m really wanting to understand your belief, but do you really you think if we say things unequivocably that has the power to create change in our kids?  I&#39;m not saying you are, but I&#39;m wondering if you&#39;re implying that we have this issue because we&#39;ve tolerated it?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nMaura</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99672907,"authorName":"mauratracy","from":"&quot;mauratracy&quot; &lt;Maura@...&gt;","profile":"mauratracy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Help with son&#39;s critical, unkind words and outbursts","postDate":"1239057355","msgId":43872,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdyZTA0YittMnRvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PENGNDBGRTU2LUZFQUEtNEY4RC05RTNGLTdDMEE5RjhFQzczMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":43871,"nextInTopic":43873,"prevInTime":43871,"nextInTime":43873,"topicId":43811,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Maybe that would be a place that would value his aggressive energy and channel it into appropriate discipline at the same time.

Then they figure out that they aren&#39;t going to hurt anyone, and in fact, that if they don&#39;t dial up the aggression, they don&#39;t progress.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny C","from":"&quot;Jenny C&quot; &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Help with son&#39;s critical, unkind words and outbursts","postDate":"1239040662","msgId":43852,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdyZGZxbStlbmdkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdyYzk0aytiOGEyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43850,"nextInTopic":43854,"prevInTime":43851,"nextInTime":43853,"topicId":43811,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... and ... irritating. ... this can help us, but it seems counter to what others may say - not sure yet - and so will take it all in, and see. ...

Chamille was behaving somewhat<br/>\naggressively towards me.  It made me uncomfortable, even though I knew<br/>\nshe was doing it in a teasing sort of way.  I made an excuse to find an<br/>\nATM machine and had Chamille walk with me to find it.  I asked her to<br/>\nplease not do what she was doing because it embarrassed me and made me<br/>\nuncomfortable, and that she had probably given a very unfavorable<br/>\nimpression of herself to these new potential friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe hadn&#39;t even been aware that she was doing something potentially<br/>\ndamaging.  She stopped doing what she had been doing, and we went back<br/>\nand had a pleasant rest of the visit, in which she was extra kind to me.<br/>\nI honestly believe that we never saw those folks again because of that<br/>\nincident.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the thing, it&#39;s our job to help our kids navigate the social<br/>\nworld.  If a kid is having difficulty doing this, perhaps the kid isn&#39;t<br/>\nready to be out there so much.  If the kid is really wanting social<br/>\noutlets and is still doing mean and hurtful things, the parent needs to<br/>\nstep in and navigate with the kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nMargaux tends to be more like this than Chamille ever was.  Some kids<br/>\nare more empathic naturally than others.  I still supervise and oversee<br/>\nmany of Margaux&#39;s social interactions, there are only a few kids that<br/>\nshe can navigate solo.  When she starts getting mean and aggressive, I<br/>\npull her aside, lure her, or simply ask her to come with me to another<br/>\nlocation for a minute.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hug her up and sympathize with the situation she is dealing with, give<br/>\nher a chance to explain her frustration, then we find some ways to solve<br/>\nit.  When she is calm again, she goes back to playing with her new<br/>\nsolutions in hand to use.  It almost always works.  Sometimes, for<br/>\nwhatever reason, she&#39;s too tired, too hungry, too whatever, and she gets<br/>\nright back in the thick of things.  When that happens, I jump in and<br/>\ntake over the social situation entirely.  That could mean that I find a<br/>\ndifferent activity for them, or I lay out some ground rules that will<br/>\navoid the conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; I have talked to him, when he&#39;s saying he can&#39;t help it, about<br/>\n </span></blockquote>quickly apologizing, like saying, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to say<br/>\nthat.&quot; He never does that, but instead says, &quot;Just kidding.&quot; I think it<br/>\nhurts him/scares him so much to have this thing he can&#39;t control that<br/>\nit&#39;s hard to admit, so he instead takes on this clown nature,<br/>\neverything&#39;s a joke.

His strong points are not social  niceties and <br/>\nsocial cues *right now*, so a lot of what you&#39;re saying is  familiar.  For Wyl, <br/>\nmore one-on-one time with me, snuggling and together  time (especially at night <br/>\ntime) seem to be what he craves. He doesn&#39;t seem to  know how to ask for it <br/>\n(or maybe even that he *is* craving it) and it comes out  in harsh tones of <br/>\nvoice and language. The more I try to explain or point out or  cope with it more <br/>\n&quot;intellectually&quot;, the worse it gets. If I stop and give him a  big hug and talk <br/>\nabout what we might do together now (rarely does he want to  stop in the <br/>\nmiddle of the day to do something) or later, the intenseness ebbs.  After a few <br/>\nnights or so of intense one-on-one time, his cup seems to be filled.  I am <br/>\ngetting better at judging when to &quot;top off&quot; his cup before it gets too low,  but <br/>\nsometimes we still need to adjust.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt seems that he has too much going on in his head and in his  high-energy <br/>\nactivities to tolerate a whole lot of snuggling and one-on-one...  Kind of like <br/>\nhis eating. He gets to involved to eat food that&#39;s right there next  to him, <br/>\neven with suggestions, sometimes, and his blood sugar gets out of whack  and he <br/>\nneeds to eat some simple carbs backed up with some protein and complex  carbs <br/>\nto balance it out. Eventually, he&#39;ll learn to balance &quot;go, go, go!&quot; with  <br/>\nreplenishment-be it emotional, mental or fuel-and things won&#39;t be so much like a  <br/>\nroller coaster. In the meantime, I can help him recognize hints and warning  <br/>\nsignals and help him remember the solutions, and help him get the solutions. I <br/>\n also have to learn where the balance is between accepting the refusal of the <br/>\n remedy and the need to press for the remedy before things get &quot;to the <br/>\nbreaking  point&quot;.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt took me a long time to &quot;get&quot; that the same old &quot;remedy&quot;  (talking it out, <br/>\nreminders) was not the right solution for Wyl in these  instances, and <br/>\nsometimes I still slip into them before I remember what really  works. At some point, <br/>\nI may need some more trial-and-error solution-finding if  what works now <br/>\nbecomes ineffective... As I&#39;ve heard said before, it&#39;s all a  dance... ebb and <br/>\nflow.<br/>\n <br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nDe<br/>\n**************Feeling the pinch at the grocery store?

And admittedly I am sure I have inflicted some myself in my exasperation.  He went to one pre-school for a few months that wasn&#39;t a good experience.  Then he went to another where the teacher got him, and was awesome with him, but I think the feedback he got from some peers was harmful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen he went to Kindergarten for three weeks or a month - I forget now - and that was really bad.  But he also has always been involved in things, homeschool groups, where he had a lot of problems in one particular group, sports where he did OK, and lots of play with neighborhood kids.  I&#39;m sure he got problematic feedback from all these experiences, but with a kid who begged for things, people, I don&#39;t know what I could&#39;ve done to sufficiently protect him.  I know I could have done some things differently, but I can&#39;t imagine that I could&#39;ve or could now, keep him away from experiences that might give him negative feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that said, I can and will give more thought to this issue.  I used to think about it a lot more, and have thought about these things less as he&#39;s matures and gotten to much better, but maybe I need to not let my guard down.<br/>\n <br/>\n&gt; i agree that it shouldn&#39;t &quot;just be tolerated&quot; (although i understand how hard it is to &gt;continuously address it in a positive/proactive way), <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a huge understatement.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;but i also wanted to say that in my experience, it was necessary to *significantly* &quot;pull &gt;inward&quot; for about a year (and still we are very selective about what we participate in) - &gt;we don&#39;t do anything, really, that puts him in a situation to be challenged beyond what &gt;he can handle and still be moderately &quot;appropriate&quot; with other people.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, as I said above, I will try to make more choices about activites more conscious with this in mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s pretty easy for us because my son has no interest in team sports or groups of kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo the case for us at all.  Jesse may be about done with soccer - I have the feeling - after six years, but he just started wrestling, and is, so far, loving it.  He badgered me to sign him up, not that I wouldn&#39;t, he just badgered to make sure I was going to do it....and, well, because he badgers about most things...<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; the last thing that i have found that&#39;s been helpful in our own home is to just be more &gt;quiet myself in my interactions with him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the opposite would be said about Jesse.  He may, if anything, need more from me.<br/>\n<br/>\n &gt; i noticed when i tuned in i could understand the &quot;triggers&quot; for the name calling or mean words. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis may be helpful for me...to see if there are triggers...maybe thing are not as random as they seem. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; i also wonder how long you&#39;ve been unschooling, although i know several unschooling &gt;families with similar intense kids, so although we are new to unschooling, i still think &gt;there are some temperamental/constitutional elements to this scenario as well as just &gt;parenting and school history.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think his issues are very constitutional, as you say, but our/my parenting may have not always helped....but may have also helped in some ways...he surely could&#39;ve been worse off in a strict, authoritarian home.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you Lyla! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99672907,"authorName":"mauratracy","from":"&quot;mauratracy&quot; &lt;Maura@...&gt;","profile":"mauratracy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Help with son&#39;s critical, unkind words and outbursts","postDate":"1238999352","msgId":43824,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdyYzdmbys5Mm5jQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDU2NDBDRUNELTE5N0EtNEFFRC1COUE2LUU1OEQyQjExQUYwRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":43820,"nextInTopic":43825,"prevInTime":43823,"nextInTime":43825,"topicId":43811,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We unschooled academically since then, but only fully did away with some traditional parenting practices like taking away privileges about 2 1/2 years ago. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;  If one of my kids called a friend &quot;stupid,&quot; I  <br/>\n&gt; would pull my child aside immediately and say it&#39;s not okay to say  <br/>\n&gt; &quot;stupid.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have said this many times.  It doesn&#39;t change his behavior.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-A recent &quot;last straw,&quot; although it feels like last straws many  <br/>\n&gt; days, was this weekend after his soccer game a mom of a teammate came  <br/>\n&gt; up to him and laid into him, saying, &quot;Jesse, you need to stop  <br/>\n&gt; criticizing your teammates. I&#39;ve heard you since the beginning of the  <br/>\n&gt; season, and we talked to the coach at the beginning of the season, and  <br/>\n&gt; you haven&#39;t stopped. I hear you out there constantly criticizing my  <br/>\n&gt; son and the others, and.......&quot; And on and on some.-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What was Jesse&#39;s reaction?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>He only said &quot;OK.&quot;  Then, when we walked away,  he said to me, &quot;I hate that kid.  He&#39;s so mean,&quot;  and went on to tell me a story of what the kid did once.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-I did talk to her after, and told her I understand her frustration,  <br/>\n&gt; but wished she had come to me, and not confronted him directly -=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Why?  She must had seen you were unable to persuade him.  She said she  <br/>\n&gt; had already talked to the coach, and that didn&#39;t help either.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, she never said a word to me, and I had no idea there was a problem. Jesse says the coach never said anything to him.   While I obviously know Jesse can behave this way, I never heard it, and never miss his games.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-I talked to him, and he says the kid is mean to him, always was.  <br/>\n&gt; The mom said that her son has been fed up with him since early on, and  <br/>\n&gt; so has since not been nice. My son *does not see* how things like,  <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Why didn&#39;t you pass it?&quot; are critical and hurt people or make them  <br/>\n&gt; mad.-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Had you not seen the behavior earlier in the season?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, I did not see this behavior, except that I know how he thinks, and what he shares with me.  He&#39;s super critical, and always compares everyone.  He talks about who is the worst player, and shares his criticisms of other with us after games and practices.  He also, though, does talk about how good some players are.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Did you consider pulling him from the activity, to protect others from  <br/>\n&gt; him, and to protect his own reputation?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not at all.  Not this season or any recent season.  I see the way kids banter, and didn&#39;t know he was going too far....except for what I wrote about the one boy.  I wouldn&#39;t thought of pulling him.  To me it&#39;s not that black and white, not so glaring.  That&#39;s what&#39;s so tough about him, always has been....he&#39;s challenging, but not enough to say, &quot;Well, my son has - fill in the blank - and can&#39;t play team sports,&quot; or something.  If he calls a teammate an idiot (not saying he did) once, it might not necessitate pulling him, and not if he says it twice, but what about if he says it three times?  Do you see the difficulty?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have, though, made some choices to control an environment or activity knowing it would not be a good fit, and I totally get the need to protect his reputation.  Problem is, and this refers also to Lyla&#39;s thoughts about pulling in some, and keeping her son away from many things, Jesse is and always has been what I&#39;ve called &quot;hyper-social.&quot;  He, even from when he was little, seemed to need to be out in the world, doing stuff, and being with friends.   Even if he is a bit of a bull in a china shop, it doesn&#39;t seem a viable solution to keep the bull in the house, or to keep the bull away from the activities he loves and needs.  (He needs the physical outlets, not saying he needs soccer, per se.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI will share with you a recent time when I considered skipping an activity I knew he&#39;d love (if it went well)  because he had some (not a lot, but maybe enough to warrant protecting others and his reputation as you say) trouble last year.  After much consideration decided to go ahead, and he had no problems.  It&#39;s hard when he&#39;s maturing, because I don&#39;t know what to expect.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My best ideas are to talk to him about making choices, and to ask him  <br/>\n&gt; to rephrase this:  &quot;He says, &quot;I was just kidding.&quot;&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ask him what he means by &quot;kidding.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I know what he means.  It&#39;s his way of trying to take it back, act like he didn&#39;t really mean what he said. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Maybe he&#39;s just not thinking  <br/>\n&gt; about what he&#39;s saying.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If he says &quot;Stupid&quot; say What do you mean by  <br/>\n&gt; &#39;stupid&#39;?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, it&#39;s funny, because he&#39;s very bright, but he surely doesn&#39;t have a very good vocabulary for expressing himself.  Everything is gay or stupid.  (He recently got to listen in on a very long conversation I had with a lesbian friend about how offensive it is to her that kids use the word gay the way they do.....you know what, I think he may be saying that a little less...)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; If he&#39;s parroting phrases and not thinking about what he&#39;s saying,  <br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s important to know.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s for sure what he&#39;s doing, that and then habit.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe talk to him about making choices, too, before he speaks.  If  <br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s not able to think before he speaks, maybe he should be  <br/>\n&gt; discouraged from speaking for a while, until he and you can work  <br/>\n&gt; through some ideas about thinking of two choices and making the better  <br/>\n&gt; choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry, but I laughed big time when I read this.  Anyone who knows Jesse would laugh out loud too.  I can&#39;t imagine how to discourage Jesse from speaking.  I&#39;m not unwilling, I just need to know what that would look like.  <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t recommend that your son listen to this, but that you listen to  <br/>\n&gt; it and think of ways to make some examples for him:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully\">http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully</a><br/>\n&gt; the audio part at the bottom<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I will listen to it tonight.

He reached a point of<br/>\nmaturity where I knew he &quot;got&quot; why people were upset and stepped back.

I&#39;m not saying I wouldn&#39;t protect him<br/>\nphysically, just allow reality happen.  Because I was consistent by not<br/>\ntrying to &quot;teach&quot; or remind I think he made a realistic leap to calculating<br/>\npossible reactions because he hasn&#39;t gone off on anyone outside of trusted<br/>\nfriends and family and very little of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nKris<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sun, Apr 5, 2009 at 8:19 PM, mauratracy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Maura@...\">Maura@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   H there.

I&#39;m asking here because I know I will get responses from people  <br/>\nwho will give my son the benefit of the doubt, and not expect that I  <br/>\ncan or should just &quot;not tolerate it,&quot; as the rest of the world would  <br/>\nsay, and where people will offer creative &quot;solutions&quot; that I have not  <br/>\nyet considered.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think you should tolerate it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- I&#39;m asking here because I know I will get responses from people  <br/>\nwho will give my son the benefit of the doubt,=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat doubt?<br/>\nTourette&#39;s isn&#39;t directed comments to people.  It&#39;s more like a tic,  <br/>\nlike a word or phrase repeated without direction.     If he&#39;s  <br/>\ndirecting meaningful words toward individuals, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s  <br/>\nTourette&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- My son is ten. He has always had less than average impulse  <br/>\ncontrol, and seems to also just have a lot more impulses than many  <br/>\nkids. He&#39;s matured over the years in many ways...-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHow long has he been unschooled?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- He&#39;s always calling his friends stupid, &quot;You&#39;re so stupid. How  <br/>\ncould you not know that?!&quot; But I must say, I hear a lot of the friends  <br/>\ntalk like this to each other too, but it does feel like he&#39;s worse.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Always&quot; is too much.  If one of my kids called a friend &quot;stupid,&quot; I  <br/>\nwould pull my child aside immediately and say it&#39;s not okay to say  <br/>\n&quot;stupid.&quot;  That was the worst word of all at our house.  It&#39;s rarely  <br/>\nsaid about any person or thing or idea.  It&#39;s just too negative and  <br/>\ncrushing, and says more about the speaker than the target.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-A recent &quot;last straw,&quot; although it feels like last straws many  <br/>\ndays, was this weekend after his soccer game a mom of a teammate came  <br/>\nup to him and laid into him, saying, &quot;Jesse, you need to stop  <br/>\ncriticizing your teammates. I&#39;ve heard you since the beginning of the  <br/>\nseason, and we talked to the coach at the beginning of the season, and  <br/>\nyou haven&#39;t stopped. I hear you out there constantly criticizing my  <br/>\nson and the others, and.......&quot; And on and on some.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat was Jesse&#39;s reaction?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I did talk to her after, and told her I understand her frustration,  <br/>\nbut wished she had come to me, and not confronted him directly -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy?  She must had seen you were unable to persuade him.  She said she  <br/>\nhad already talked to the coach, and that didn&#39;t help either.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I talked to him, and he says the kid is mean to him, always was.  <br/>\nThe mom said that her son has been fed up with him since early on, and  <br/>\nso has since not been nice. My son *does not see* how things like,  <br/>\n&quot;Why didn&#39;t you pass it?&quot; are critical and hurt people or make them  <br/>\nmad.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHad you not seen the behavior earlier in the season?<br/>\nDid you consider pulling him from the activity, to protect others from  <br/>\nhim, and to protect his own reputation?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy best ideas are to talk to him about making choices, and to ask him  <br/>\nto rephrase this:  &quot;He says, &quot;I was just kidding.&quot;&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAsk him what he means by &quot;kidding.&quot;   Maybe he&#39;s just not thinking  <br/>\nabout what he&#39;s saying.  If he says &quot;Stupid&quot; say What do you mean by  <br/>\n&#39;stupid&#39;?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s parroting phrases and not thinking about what he&#39;s saying,  <br/>\nthat&#39;s important to know.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe talk to him about making choices, too, before he speaks.  If  <br/>\nhe&#39;s not able to think before he speaks, maybe he should be  <br/>\ndiscouraged from speaking for a while, until he and you can work  <br/>\nthrough some ideas about thinking of two choices and making the better  <br/>\nchoice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t recommend that your son listen to this, but that you listen to  <br/>\nit and think of ways to make some examples for him:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully\">http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully</a><br/>\nthe audio part at the bottom<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIs Jesse adopted?<br/>\nIs there a possibility of fetal alcohol syndrome?<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99672907,"authorName":"mauratracy","from":"&quot;mauratracy&quot; &lt;Maura@...&gt;","profile":"mauratracy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Help with son&#39;s critical, unkind words and outbursts","postDate":"1238987982","msgId":43811,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdyYnNjZStia2EzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":43812,"prevInTime":43810,"nextInTime":43812,"topicId":43811,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"H there.  My son is ten.  He has always had less than average impulse control, and seems to also just have a lot more impulses than many kids.  He s matured","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1210400557\">H there.  My son is ten.  He has always had less than average impulse control, and seems to also just have a lot more impulses than many kids.  He&#39;s matured over the years in many ways to where his physical impulses are more often just to bang on things, fiddle with things, etc., and not used against others *as much*.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing, though, seems to have gotten worse, his impulsive words and expressions.  He is, so I&#39;m told by my friends, pretty good with them, like when he&#39;s at a sleepover with them or something, he&#39;s respectful.  But at home with us, his parents and brother, he&#39;s really tough to take.  He says to us all manner of hurtful things all the time.  Examples are, &quot;Duh.&quot;  &quot;Shut the frick up.&quot;  &quot;You&#39;re fat.&quot;  &quot;Stupid lady.&quot;  &quot;You&#39;re such an idiot.&quot;  And sings about his brother, at the top of his lungs, &quot;Boogie&#39;s an idiot.&quot;  And please forgive me for posting this one, it&#39;s so crass to me, but helps illustrate the extent of this issue, &quot;Suck my butt.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe context of these things is totally random.  He shouts them out out of no where, or in response to simple questions like, &quot;What do you want to eat?&quot;    It&#39;s so prevalent I have wondered if he has Tourettes Syndrome, but can&#39;t figure that out, and besides, the fact that he mostly does this at home, or where he&#39;s comfortable makes me think it can&#39;t be; he must have some control.  (Although I think people with Tourette&#39;s also have *some* control.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he says these things, I used to always correct him, but it never changed anything.  When he was younger, when I still used &quot;consequences,&quot; or punishment, we would succeed at getting rid of particular words that we were singling out, but soon after other words would just take their place.  Now, sometimes I ignore them (at one time as a strategy to make them go away if not paid attention to, but now mostly because I feel so powerless, and don&#39;t know what else to do.)  Sometimes I will get angry, and say, &quot;Don&#39;t talk to me that way!!!!!&quot;  Other times I will more calmly ask him to stop.  Mostly, though, it&#39;s anger or resignation.  I&#39;ve talked to him, and he pretty much says he just says things, and when I&#39;ve laid into him in anger sometimes at my wits end, he&#39;ll cry and say he doesn&#39;t know why he does it, and can&#39;t help himself.  It&#39;s horribly sad, and I feel so guilty for being mad at him, but sometimes I feel so beaten down, I feel battered and can&#39;t muster patience or understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have talked to him, when he&#39;s saying he can&#39;t help it, about quickly apologizing, like saying, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.  I didn&#39;t mean to say that.&quot;  He never does that, but instead says, &quot;Just kidding.&quot;  I think it hurts him/scares him so much to have this thing he can&#39;t control that it&#39;s hard to admit, so he instead takes on this clown nature, everything&#39;s a joke.  I personally, even though I can articulate an understanding of how this comes to be, end up seeing him sometimes as a jerk - who would joke *like that*; it&#39;s not funny.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will add, to clarify, that he is not only like this with us, but to a lesser extent with friends too.  He&#39;s always calling his friends stupid, &quot;You&#39;re so stupid.  How could you not know that?!&quot;  But I must say, I hear a lot of the friends talk like this to each other too, but it does feel like he&#39;s worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother quality of all this is the criticism.  I will say, like a recent mention on this list, that my son has some qualities that will be awesome when he matures, but now are rough.  He is very observant, very critical, sees hypocrisy, catches incongruencies, sees others&#39; mistakes, etc..  He is bright, and much of the time his observations are spot on, but he lacks any grace, understanding, or compassion.  It&#39;s like he sees absolutely no connection between his critical words and how someone might *feel* in response to them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA recent &quot;last straw,&quot; although it feels like last straws many days, was this weekend after his soccer game a mom of a teammate came up to him and laid into him, saying, &quot;Jesse, you need to stop criticizing your teammates.  I&#39;ve heard you since the beginning of the season, and we talked to the coach at the beginning of the season, and you haven&#39;t stopped.  I hear you out there constantly criticizing my son and the others, and.......&quot;  And on and on some.  She didn&#39;t call him names, and didn&#39;t yell at him, but really told it as it was.  I wanted to protect him from this public confrontation, but was torn, thinking, in desperation to help him, that maybe he&#39;ll hear this, and eventually get it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI did talk to her after, and told her I understand her frustration, but wished she had come to me, and not confronted him directly (they have no relationship; we don&#39;t know her at all).  She was very apologetic for that, said she was just so upset that here her son was crying, even after a game they won, hurt by something/s my son said.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI talked to him, and he says the kid is mean to him, always was.  The mom said that her son has been fed up with him since early on, and so has since not been nice.  My son *does not see* how things like, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you pass it?&quot; are critical and hurt people or make them mad.  I hate to admit it, but I believe my son started it, that his criticisms pushed this kid over the edge.  It may be true that he had a low tolerance, but I think it probably is true that is started with my son&#39;s insensitivity.  (The other day he pointed out to his teammates that one boy - a skinny boy who is not one of the more athletic on the team - had his shorts on inside out and said, &quot;Hey, everyone laugh at Ryan.  He has his shorts on inside out.&quot;  And all the boys laughed.  Just another example to support why I believe he started the problem with the other boy.  He did not see how getting everyone to laugh at Ryan was bad.  He says, &quot;I was just kidding.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, finally, to clarify, summarize, some of the things my son says just seem like random outbursts, while others seem understandable observation, criticism, but ones that when shared hurt people.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, one final thing, I think a lot of my son&#39;s more random outbursts, obnoxious mean sayings come out of boredom.  He needs a lot of stimulation - intellectual and physical - and we can&#39;t keep up with that need.  He chooses to spend his mornings in front of the computer, and after a while I think he&#39;s almost busting out of his body.  We used to say, when people would say we should make him sit in his high chair that we couldn&#39;t because we knew he would combust, or his head would blow off.  He&#39;s a bundle of energy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat can I do to help my son?  I know his heart, and although he acts like such a jerk I know how he cares about people.  He loves animals, and babies, and feels joy when others are joyful.  He is sooooo hard to live with, and I am so sad how he hurts others.  (Especially his little brother.)  I feel a duty to do all I can to protect others - like his teammates.  But I also want to help him so he is not perceived as nothing but a jerk, and treated as such by the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra, I&#39;m afraid this is way too long for this list.  It seems like something where all the context is important to understand and to find solutions.  Maybe also this &quot;problem&quot; is beyond the scope of this list.  I&#39;m asking here because I know I will get responses from people who will give my son the benefit of the doubt, and not expect that I can or should just &quot;not tolerate it,&quot; as the rest of the world would say, and where people will offer creative &quot;solutions&quot; that I have not yet considered.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nMaura</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43926,"nextTopicId":43945}}
