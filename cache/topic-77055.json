(He is 12 by the way.)  But it does give him a feeling of having work to do, so if he is in the mood to do work, he knows just what to turn to!   Maybe next time your daughter asks for more work to do, you could help her come up with a list of things she enjoys so she can refer to it.  If she is looking for work that makes her feel helpful, maybe you could offer her a project like organizing your junk drawer, or putting labels on the lids of your spice jars, or organizing all the mismatched socks?<br><br></div><div>Ali<br></div><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><br><br><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-373603879gmail_extra\"><br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-373603879gmail_quote\">On Thu, May 5, 2016 at 8:17 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jessiwoodman@...\">jessiwoodman@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] <span dir=\"ltr\">&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-373603879gmail_quote\" style=\"margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;\">\n\n\n<u></u>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n<div style=\"background-color:#fff;\">\n<span> </span>\n\n\n<div>\n  <div>\n\n\n    <div>\n      \n      \n      <p></p><p><span>Been reading here for about a year and deschooling for almost that long--kids have never been to school but we did &#39;school at home&#39; for about 6 months--they are now 8, 6, 4 and 18 months.

You could trade for babysitting.  Adding one or two kids to four is a minor percentage.  Adding four to one is HUGE, so you can’t expect a mother of one or two to keep all yours, but maybe they could take the oldest out!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut please don’t neglect her just because you have three others.  Choices were made.  Your daughter has actual NEEDS for attention and touch and focus.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/howto/precisely\">http://sandradodd.com/howto/precisely</a><br/>\nThere’s a graph there you might want to consider.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would not “provide structure” for a child any more than I would create punishments for a child who asked for punishments.  I don’t think controlling another person (which will inevitably involve shame and pressure and judging “failure” to some extent) is good for MY soul.   I would support a child who wanted to create her own structure.  Does she need an alarm clock?  If you find an old smart phone you might still be able to use the alarm clock and set all sorts of notices and timers.  If that phone can still get on wifi, maybe a calendar (and a bunch of happily distracting YouTube) would be accessible.  Or would she prefer a datebook or a wall calendar?  Filing box?  Folders?  Sticky notes?  Bulletin boards?  Digital camera of her own?  If she asks for organizational tools, try to get them for her.  And if she doesn’t really use them of “stay organized,” don’t say anything at all.  She might use them later.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids use folders they got when they were little, that have stayed in the house.  Kirby took a Ninja Turtle pocket-folder with him when he went to the community college.  He used to keep video game notes in there.  Last week, Holly was here and found some artsy old folders—one was a Lisa Frank folder that had been in the house for 20 years or so. :-)  She took them away, where she’s living now, to file banking stuff, work stuff, I don’t know what.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you buy office supplies now, it’s an investment in not needing to buy them later on. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nLive loosely.  Don’t invest too much emotion in the outcome, but live in the moment, lightly.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":443923164,"authorName":"Cass Kotrba","from":"Cass Kotrba &lt;caskot@...&gt;","profile":"cass.kotrba","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] ideas about structure","postDate":"1462718365","msgId":77060,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENPTDQwMS1FQVM1MThBOTM5Mzc0MTIxODgyODE1NTI3OEM0N0YwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PENBTUhKS0w4cE9mNW85RS1DPTBMbkFkNldzYU1rZkM5YU9SNzkzQ0ZxbUpyZTRKSGRpd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG5nZ3VyZStpaDIxNDVAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPiA8Q0FNSEpLTDhwT2Y1bzlFLUM9MExuQWQ2V3NhTWtmQzlhT1I3OTNDRnFtSnJlNEpIZGl3QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":77059,"nextInTopic":77062,"prevInTime":77059,"nextInTime":77061,"topicId":77055,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I wonder if she s looking for ... because she has the idea that you are too busy to go with her to do things she enjoys.

The girl was talking about all of the things she does to help the people there and she was so proud about it. :) She helps one lady open and sort the mail, for example. Apparently that gal really appreciates her help, as she was telling her grandpa. The conversation was so adorable that as we left I looked at the grandma and gave her a big smile.
