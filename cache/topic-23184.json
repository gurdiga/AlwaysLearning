The fruits and  <br/>\nvegetables have other elements and compounds and fiber and vitamins.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe&#39;re talking about doing and living and not acting.  I&#39;m not being  <br/>\nfacetious.  I&#39;m talking about a way of BEING and living, not a way of  posturing.<br/>\n <br/>\nTo villify a food (or a tv show or a style of music) isn&#39;t as rational as  <br/>\nshowing comparisons.  Something can be worse than another thing in one way  or <br/>\nanother without being evil/bad/satanic/deadly. **<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAdding to what you said, I would say that *black and white* thinking (about food or anything else) is too simplistic and too inaccurate to contribute positively to a child&#39;s intellectual development.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes some parents can fall into a pattern of black and white thinking where things are either all good or all bad (or educational vs. pleasureable)  (EEP!)  Yes, our kids may need some explanations kept simple, when they are little, but oversimplifying or slanting our message does not facilitate learning and understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when we make statements here that are too simple, it&#39;s quite valuable to have people add the relevant qualifiers and quirky details that help fill out the whole picture.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23181,"nextTopicId":23171}}
