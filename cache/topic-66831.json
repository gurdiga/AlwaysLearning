My kids, especially my almost 6 year old, often want to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1660277491\">Would it help if you try to explain the other mother&#39;s reasoning instead of considering it arbitrary?  My kids, especially my almost 6 year old, often want to know why other parents parent the way they do.  It would be tempting/easier to tell him it&#39;s just arbitrary and that other parents who aren&#39;t unschoolers don&#39;t make sense.  But I don&#39;t want him to repeat that, or to be left without a thoughtful answer when he asks a thoughtful question, so I try to explain what people might be thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, if the other mother says, &quot;Time to come in now&quot;, and you are out there with your child, not ready to go in, maybe you could say to your child, &quot;He has to get up early tomorrow for daycare/school so she wants to help him get to sleep.  Let&#39;s be quieter so we don&#39;t disturb him.&quot;  If the other child overhears, even better.  And if this becomes the standing explanation for why the other child routinely has to go in before your children, everyone may start to say it and understand it too, rather than arguing or resenting as much, or expecting your kids to go in without a reason.  And the other mother may benefit from not being considered arbitrary as much.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe if you can find situations in which to do this type of explaining, it will help to buffer other times when things Are arbitrary.  That way you&#39;re not &quot;always&quot; contradicting the other parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I offer my son a coat, he will say, &quot;I&#39;m not cold&quot; if he&#39;s not cold, and I may take a coat for him just in case.  I may say later, &quot;Remember, your coat is here if you get cold.&quot;  When it was freezing and we were about to walk through a parking lot out in public, and he declined a coat, I explained to him about Children&#39;s Services and how other people may worry and report us and why that would not be good.  A few times, he still said he wasn&#39;t cold enough for a coat, so I carried it very obviously, while he held my hand.  If anyone had said anything to me about it, I would have said something like, &quot;I know, he must be really hot blooded!  But I have his coat right here.  Let&#39;s hurry, kids, I&#39;m cold.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nLegally parents are required to provide coats for their children, but a lot of parents take it further and think they need to force the kids to wear them whenever the temperature is such that an &quot;authority&quot; or grandmother may think it&#39;s chilly.  Alot of times the parents themselves don&#39;t wear a coat. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe talking about your reasoning and why it&#39;s different from the neighbors (in concrete ways, not &quot;because we&#39;re unschoolers&quot;) it will help smooth things over.  If the neighbors hear that you understand their reasoning, they may be more likely to understand yours and not see you as overly permissive and/or neglectful.<br/>\n<br/>\nmaryann<br/>\nmama to 5 year old and 2 year old<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mrs Williams &lt;mrsw5791@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ==What&#39;s your goal? that&#39;s the part which isn&#39;t clear to me.

It&#39;s not &quot;Here is my laptop; please fix it.&quot;  It&#39;s &quot;When a laptop doesn&#39;t turn on quickly, what might be the problem?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some prior discussions about the discussion, in hopes we don&#39;t need to discuss the discussion again:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/lists/discussionsOFdiscussions.html\">http://sandradodd.com/lists/discussionsOFdiscussions.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nFrom one of those, by Pam Sorooshian:<br/>\n========<br/>\n<br/>\nI apologize in advance because sometimes I forget that people take<br/>\nresponses to their posts as if they are written directly TO them, personally.<br/>\nAll comments I ever make are really to the &quot;idea&quot; - not necessarily to an<br/>\nindividual poster. I take what you may have posted and I just start thinking<br/>\nabout it and post about the subject - anything I say may not at all apply to<br/>\nyou and I may not even THINK it might apply to you. I just think that any<br/>\ntopic brought up in any post becomes fodder for exploration and delving into<br/>\nmore deeply.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is REALLY good to develop an &quot;if the shoe fits&quot; attitude about email<br/>\nlists. If somebody posts something in response to your post, but you don&#39;t<br/>\nthink the shoe fits, then don&#39;t feel like you have to defend yourself - just<br/>\ntell yourself, &quot;Woops, they think that shoe fits me, but I know it doesn&#39;t.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes the opposite happens -- sometimes you&#39;ll read a post that is NOT<br/>\ndirected to you, but it&#39;ll sting or disturb you anyway because you DO fit<br/>\nthat particular shoe.<br/>\n=========<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd my favorite bit ever on the topic, by Joyce Fetteroll:<br/>\n---------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThe list is about ideas, not about people.<br/>\nThink of ideas like balls and the list like a ball court. If someone tosses an idea worth discussing into the court it&#39;s going to get batted about. At that point what&#39;s going on is no longer about the person who tossed the idea in. It&#39;s about the idea and how well and cleanly it&#39;s being tossed about. (Unless the tosser keeps jumping in and grabbing the idea ball saying &quot;Mine!&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":342782030,"authorName":"K Pennell","from":"K Pennell &lt;mrsringsabre@...&gt;","profile":"mrsringsabre","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] How to &quot;navigate&quot; with close neigbors?","postDate":"1335874538","msgId":66932,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMzU4NzQ1MzguNTAyODcuWWFob29NYWlsQ2xhc3NpY0B3ZWIxMjE3MDEubWFpbC5uZTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMzU4Mzc0ODMuODY4NjYuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyNTEwMS5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":66931,"nextInTopic":66933,"prevInTime":66931,"nextInTime":66933,"topicId":66831,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It sounds to me as though you are living near at least some neighbors who may be too controlling to just adjust to those rules to make things easier for the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-299970011\">It sounds to me as though you are living near at least some neighbors who may be &quot;too controlling&quot; to just adjust to those rules to make things easier for the moment? Am I right? It is nice to make things easier for your neighbors when you can, but there may be times this won&#39;t be practical. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are part of a homeschool group. We don&#39;t all have the same rules, but it hasn&#39;t been a problem. I haven&#39;t really felt the need to curb my child&#39;s freedom, except with safety issues (such as if a really little child is on the trampoline and my son is being a bit too bouncy). Sometimes one kid has to leave, and really doesn&#39;t want to. I might quietly suggest to my son that he walk the friend to the car, say good bye and make plans for a play date. That might help give the friend closure and a warm welcome back for next time, without cramping anyone else&#39;s style. Other times the kids turn it into a game all on their own. &quot;I&#39;ll race you to your car&quot; type of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Mon, 4/30/12, Mrs Williams &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrsw5791@...\">mrsw5791@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Mrs Williams &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrsw5791@...\">mrsw5791@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] How to &quot;navigate&quot; with close neigbors?<br/>\nTo: &quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, April 30, 2012, 9:58 PM<br/>\n<br/>\nAlright.

Please don&#39;t interpret this to mean <br/>\nthat I don&#39;t want to care about what she wants or not. I ask her all the time if x or y is okay by her.

Sorry for that confusion!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I am looking for advice/ideas for phrasing or actions for those situations where we choose not to do as the neighbor, and where it&#39;s clearly expected of me/us to somehow chime in.

I think for them all, it&#39;s quite natural to follow whatever the &quot;house habits&quot; are in that place.<br/>\nThe issues arise mostly when they are all playing outside, in the shared yardspace. This is when differences show most, both in what different children are allowed to or not, and in how parents handle conflicts and such.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children are 12, 7, 4 and 18mos.  Neighbors are 4,4, 3 and 6. All this stuff mainly concerns my two middle children.<br/>\n<br/>\n==I would encourage you to find a homeschool park day now, rather than<br/>\nwaiting for school to start and there is a sudden void. ==<br/>\n<br/>\nThe neighbor children are all in daycare, so aren&#39;t home until around 4-5pm on weekdays. In that sense, we are used to not relying on our close neighbors for &quot;entertainment&quot;.

I just need to figure out some specific ways to (re)act and phrase things, that will be as considerate of all parties as possible.

I realize it&#39;s a choice. Courteous and all that. Like I said, I have these talks often with my children. I think that the difficulty in this, lies not within the situation itself, but with the frequency. To take the example of going in when the other boy has to.

I love living in this almost Melrose Place-like way. Choosing to leave/not eat something/stop playing or whatever is never a hassle per se. Like you say, it&#39;s simple courtesy and consideration. We do it all the time. What makes it different here, is that these situations arise on a daily basis, several times a day even.

But in a case like our residency again, you could not possibly abstain from eating sugary stuff in the presence of that child ever.

I have been on a &quot;discussion list break&quot; for a few years, needed to focus on actual life w/ the kids and learn by doing rather than just reading ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I have a situation I would love som input on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in an appartment building, a very small one, only 7 co-owners. This is great for many things, such as the kids always having companions for play ;-)<br/>\nWe share a common yard/garden and the kids mostly just run in and out of our respective appartments. It&#39;s almost like living on a playground continually! This means that a LOT of adult supervision is needed, as there are often conflicts arising over various things. Overall things are playing out nicely, though the differences in parenting styles obviously comes out clearly and influences many situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, my question is this: <br/>\n<br/>\nIt feels akward (and frustrating!) at times to balance the unschooling philosophy in this setting. Like when my neighbor will speak to the boys in a you that means both of them, as in &quot;you have to put on a coat to go outside&quot; and my son will just go outside in t-shirt. This will then make the other boy run out without a coat too, obviously - creating the inevitable scene of the mother following after with the famous coat and then the wailing and protesting &quot;but why does HE not have to then???&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example could be evenings when kids are playing in the yard and next-door boy is called in and my son continues to play outside. This often launches a traditional chase around the garden for the mother to catch her son. Well, my husband says we dont *have to* make it harder for the mother (thereby meaning that we could call it a night too and go in)....well, I say it&#39;s not my job to help her enforce arbitrary stuff ;-) BUT i also acknowledge of course, that it&#39;s nice to abstain from things, or to do x or y in certain circumstances, out of respect and consideration for the other. I have talked to my kids about this many times over the years, how we or they could *choose* to do or not do something out of empathy/solidarity for the other person, even if we didn&#39;t *have to*.But I&#39;d find that a bit of hassle to do all the time or very often, due to the &quot;closeness&quot; here - and not really helpful for our own life, which we precisely try to live with out<br/>\n all these restreints;-)<br/>\nI predict that it is only going to increase with the boy starting school this fall.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have any general suggestions for this?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nMette (in Denmark)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Growing Without Schooling back issues on line","postDate":"1335188784","msgId":66832,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg3MTJGODI3LTNDNjgtNDRBMi05NTZDLUI0MTc2NDU2M0E4OUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDExRkMwQjc0LUVEMjctNDBEQi04RkUxLTI1RUIwNDI5MjU2M0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDExRkMwQjc0LUVEMjctNDBEQi04RkUxLTI1RUIwNDI5MjU2M0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":66831,"nextInTopic":66888,"prevInTime":66831,"nextInTime":66833,"topicId":66831,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-When you make a press release aren t you supposed to like release it to the press ?

Growing Without Schooling is the nation�s first magazine about homeschooling, unschooling, and learning outside of school, founded by the late author/teacher John Holt in 1977.<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.holtgws.com also contains significant amounts of new information about John Holt and his work, including never-before-released video footage of Holt, photographs, and newly digitized audio files of interviews and lectures by Holt where he discusses how schools could be improved.<br/>\n<br/>\n�GWS documents 24 years of personal stories, news articles, research, books and the strong flowering of the homeschooling movement from 1977 to 2001. In 1977 there were perhaps 10 to 20 thousand homeschoolers and in 2001 it was estimated there were about 1.2 million homeschooled children. In 2011, estimates put that number over two million,� says Farenga.<br/>\n============<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66849,"nextTopicId":66976}}
