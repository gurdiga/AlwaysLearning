Because writing left-handed normally from left to <br/>\nright with a nibbed pen or fountain pen smeared the ink, I had to <br/>\ncurl my hand around the top of what I was writing.

In my final year, I had a teacher that I had a very positive <br/>\nrelationship with. Admittedly, I was one of her pet pupils, so maybe <br/>\nthat influenced my high opinion of her. There was a girl in our class <br/>\nwho had been to America on a family vacation - to us in those days, <br/>\nthat was an expedition to a far off land - in particular, to New <br/>\nOrleans. She was asked by our teacher to tell the story to the class. <br/>\nOur teacher preceded that, however, by informing us that New Orleans <br/>\nwas named after the French city of Orlean, home of Joan of Arc, etc, <br/>\nwhich is pronounced Or-lay-on. Then the girl started her story of her <br/>\nfamily&#39;s visit to New Orleans. Except every time the girl said &quot;New <br/>\nOrleans&quot;, the teacher corrected her with &quot;Or-lay-on&quot;. So the girl was <br/>\ngoing &quot;When we landed at the airport in New Orleans&quot;...&quot;Or-lay-<br/>\non&quot;...&quot;When we landed at the airport in New Or-lay-on&quot;, like that <br/>\nthrough the entire story. And every time the teacher &#39;corrected&#39; her, <br/>\nit made it more difficult for the girl to tell her story and more <br/>\nirritating for the rest of us to listen to it. We may not have known <br/>\nmuch about America, but we knew New Orleans was called New Orleans. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think I&#39;ve lost respect for anybody quite as quickly as I lost <br/>\nrespect for that teacher that day.
