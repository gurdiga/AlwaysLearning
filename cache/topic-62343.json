I said no, stay until that show&#39;s over.  I did it because Kirby was probably still angry, and it seemed easier to let adrenaline dissipate slowly than to risk a relapse of the argument.  So I used TV as a time-out corner one time in the late 1990&#39;s. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t easy to get him to stay there.  It wasn&#39;t mesmerizing for him.

This week I have three boys (6, 4 and 10 months) with high temperatures, restless nights and the fretful misery and exhaustion that goes with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the beginning, when the first one got sick, I raided the supermarket and our on-demand tv subscription for snacks and quiet toys and new TV I thought would appeal. I&#39;ve done everything I can manage to allow them to be entertained and happy while fairly quiet and calm (since activity seems to make them worse fast).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I think that amounts to a reasonably concerted effort to &#39;plonk&#39; two kids who already enjoy TV and computer games. But the plonking hasn&#39;t had much effect! It seems that I can&#39;t make TV more interesting, or make them want to watch much more of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve listened to audio books, made a giant Modroc volcano hide away, played in mud (warm baths after!), read books, discussed chromosomes and done reproduction Van Gogh&#39;s (not my idea, honest!). But not that much TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":458624268,"authorName":"dola dasgupta-banerji","from":"dola dasgupta-banerji &lt;doladg@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Plonking a child down in front of the television","postDate":"1313308389","msgId":62360,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBRTA1UktNa2t6VW5TU3JuZnBtNUdYLXNvemEwQzNqMW9fMFE1RXBWdEVBeStLU0JMUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDk2Mzc3QkVFLUM3QUMtNDEwNy05RDgyLTdCNEZBNTVBREMxMEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDk2Mzc3QkVFLUM3QUMtNDEwNy05RDgyLTdCNEZBNTVBREMxMEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":62359,"nextInTopic":62361,"prevInTime":62359,"nextInTime":62361,"topicId":62343,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am from India, we speak Bangla at home and English mostly.

Same could be said about tv. And a lot of the fear, I think, stems from parents not watching with their kids, or not even being in close proximity to their kids while they are watching. My 4 year old daughter is watching a groovy show called &#39;Octonauts&#39; right now while I&#39;m typing this. We&#39;ve set up the computer in the lounge room so I am literally a few feet away. And it would be obvious to anyone that she is not just mindlessly staring at the screen. She talks to me, tells me about something on the show that&#39;s amusing, gets up and moves around. It&#39;s a positive and fun shared experience. No control, no fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause most of the time I am watching with them, when they refer to something they&#39;ve seen on tv, I actually know what they&#39;re talking about! Things we&#39;ve watched together form part of the shared fabric of our lives. And we have all learned an enormous amount from tv shows.
