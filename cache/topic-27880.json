I could be more explicit, but am feeling uncomfortable out<br/>\nof consideration for others, about doing that publicly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t read anyone suggesting putting a child in a situation of<br/>\nhaving sex.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No. You&#39;re right there. But, in throwing around ideas I, and others,<br/>\nmoved beyond any specific. So that the cultural and social waters we<br/>\nare all swimming in became part of what was being talked about, part<br/>\nof what informs the discussions. Our culture, Western culture, is<br/>\npretty much sex saturated nowadays, and as a mother I&#39;ve felt like I<br/>\nneeded to find ways to help my daughter navigate that. I&#39;m not<br/>\nconvinced that the saturation that passes for liberation is, in fact,<br/>\nanything like what I&#39;d identify as real liberation. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, the sexualisation of ever younger children seems wrong<br/>\nto me. The idea that&#39;s out there, in the broader culture that<br/>\nliberation means anything-goes, including those who think that<br/>\nchildren should be liberated from the bonds of taboos against sexual<br/>\nactivity between adults and children. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy interest in this area is informal, and springs largely from being a<br/>\nmother. In criticising what I see in the broader culture, I&#39;ve<br/>\nendeavoured to educate myself and form some picture of what would sit<br/>\nbetter with me than a lot of what we have, so I&#39;ve read quite a lot<br/>\nabout sexuality, and talked with people who know more than I,<br/>\nincluding some who work in the area of sexual abuse - one woman stands<br/>\nout in my mind because she chose her work because of startlingly bad<br/>\nexperiences she&#39;d had as a child.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You seem to have a bit of a knee-jerk reaction to this subject, if<br/>\n </span></blockquote>you don&#39;t mind my saying...talked about being mad, and<br/>\nimpatient...what&#39;s that about?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think I explained that, and apologised for it, perhaps not well.<br/>\nAgain, I got worked up in my head about something that angers me, the<br/>\nabuse of children and those who would and have moved to justify that,<br/>\nin the broader culture, then projected some ill feeling into the thread.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So far I&#39;ve only read suggestions from unschoolers, mostly long-time<br/>\n&gt; unschoolers, about discerning &quot;junk&quot; from reality, paying attention<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to warning signs, keeping an open mind and open communication, being<br/>\ncareful of kids you don&#39;t know much about if something seems off,<br/>\nlistening to and respecting children...what there to be mad and<br/>\nimpatient about?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just curious,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There wasn&#39;t anything in the thread for me to be mad and impatient<br/>\nabout; there were lots of good, helpful, useful things said. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s lots outside the thread, in the broader culture, to be mad and<br/>\nimpatient about, I think.
