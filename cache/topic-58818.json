The trick is  <br/>\nthat, it doesn�t mean that your kid is totally free to flower and to  <br/>\ngrow, it�s much more reverse psychology. �Not only do you have to  <br/>\nlearn, but you have to love to learn.� The message is in a way even  <br/>\nmore twisted. It�s not, �You have to read this book and take this test  <br/>\nbecause that�s the way it is.

If unschooling is done well, a child doesn&#39;t NEED to &quot;love to learn.&quot;  He won&#39;t even know he&#39;s learning, when life is all full of learning.  And if life is joyous and fun, how could he need to decide whether he loved joy and fun or not?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-My  mom used to always say, &quot;if you&#39;re bored you&#39;re boring.&quot;-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI restored the quotes.

This part of the discussion was read aloud when we had company last week, and I said maybe a cartoonist should make a cartoon of a kid saying to a mom, &quot;If I&#39;m bored, you&#39;re boring.&quot;   The question was asked, though, what the mom&#39;s response should be.  I had been thinking of a single frame.   But in unrelated banter the same week, we had discussed the lightbulb-over-the-head cartoon motif that means &quot;I just had an idea.&quot;  If those new curly-looking bulbs become standard, there might come to be kids who don&#39;t get the visual reference.  And a drawing of one of those over someone&#39;s head would be odd.  Holly said, &quot;I just had an ecologically responsible idea!&quot;  (or maybe she said &quot;energy-efficient idea,&quot; but she&#39;s asleep and I can&#39;t ask--maybe Robin or Julie remembers).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, that mom should have had many more and better ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in most people&#39;s follow-up response cartoon imagination, the mom probably didn&#39;t get the idea to be less boring.  She probably got a punitive, angry black smudge above her head.  My mother would have hit me if I had said &quot;If I&#39;m bored, you&#39;re boring.&quot;  But eventually my mom pretty much thought anything that didn&#39;t involve the drinking of alcohol was boring.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s something I wrote about boredom many years back:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/BoredNoMore\">http://sandradodd.com/BoredNoMore</a><br/>\n<br/>\nA quote (which I think I&#39;ll take to Just Add Light and Stir):<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes the real message behind &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; is &quot;I&#39;m little and feeling agitated and vaguely unhappy and I don&#39;t know what I can do to get over this uncomfortable feeling.

I&#39;m still catching up from having had a lot of company.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor this list, it can be important to remember that what people call unschooling might be quite different from the kind of radical unschooling Joyce and I have described and collected writings on.  Others describe it too, and one of us saves and web-publishes it.   There are MANY people who claim unschooling who read our accounts and are shocked that ANYONE would live the way we do.  Many families consider unschooling to be something done (or not done) during school hours, in lieu of school.  Many think that letting a child do his math lessons when and where he wants to is the epitome of unschooling.  If he can wait until another day or week, and can do it on the couch or in the yard, they feel themselves to be unschooling.  Some first &quot;teach&quot; their children to read, and then leave them to read the rest of their &quot;education,&quot; and consider that unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-She goes on to discuss how this (school) was a shocking experience, and how she <br/>\nliterally became motivated by grades, stopped reading other than what was <br/>\nassigned, etc. Still, she continued to go to school. She went on to college by <br/>\n16 (I think) and Brown graduate school by 19yo, but ended up dropping out, <br/>\nrealizing that it didn&#39;t fit her. When she stopped pursuing ivy league <br/>\neducation, she claims her parents were happy that she got over her silly <br/>\nobsession with the ivy league (paraphrasing). This seemed really judgmental to <br/>\nme, which I could see being a reason for her to reach out to &quot;the mainstream&quot;. <br/>\nIf she had felt that she was &quot;weird&quot;, which she says that she did, and her <br/>\nparents were supportive of &quot;weird&quot; but not of &quot;mainstream&quot;, then her need to <br/>\nrebel against that to feel &quot;normal&quot; was probably pretty strong-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was neglected at home until she was 12 or so, then, and decided to go to school at 13, looks like to me.  By the time she was 16 she had finished or dropped out of school and she hothoused her college education.  She wasn&#39;t grown before she had fully dedicated herself to school and schooling.  Then she dropped out of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow is that an unschooling story, really?  It&#39;s someone using the word, but not someone having grown up in a rich, supportive life of learning without school.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-So, even if a parent is supportive, embracing of a child&#39;s interests, trusts the <br/>\nchild&#39;s ability to learn, etc. etc., it may be that *that* child still will feel <br/>\nthe need to escape from or be free of parents and family once they hit their <br/>\nteens and twenties. And, I believe, that this, the desire to be on one&#39;s own, <br/>\nis actually very naturally a part of growing up. It isn&#39;t something to prevent, <br/>\nbut rather embrace.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know anyone who has tried to prevent a child growing up and leaving.  Here&#39;s what I wrote about Kirby a few months ago, in a text-based interview:<br/>\nIn case it&#39;s hard to read below, it&#39;s here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://featherandnestkim.blogspot.com/2010/11/unschooling-surprise-sandra-dodd-is-in.html\">http://featherandnestkim.blogspot.com/2010/11/unschooling-surprise-sandra-dodd-is-in.html</a><br/>\nand there&#39;s a quote and a photo of baby Kirby here:   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/2010/12/arrivals-and-departures.html\">http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/2010/12/arrivals-and-departures.html</a><br/>\nKim: I feel the same way. So privileged to know about our kids in that connected way. So your children are older now, can you share about them and what they are doing in their lives?<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra: Kirby is 24 and lives in Austin, Texas. The company he works for, Blizzard Entertainment, paid to move him there, just as he was turning 21. He&#39;s not allowed to publically talk about what he does at work, so I can&#39;t share that, but those who recognize the company name will be able to make a guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe keep in touch with Kirby by various electronic means, and we see him a couple of times a year. He was in town for a wedding in summer. His brother drove out there to surprise him on his birthday. Kirby and I went to a homeschooling conference in California. In December we&#39;re meeting at a friend&#39;s house in Texas, between our towns.<br/>\n<br/>\nKim: Do you miss him lots? Stupid question!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra: No. I thought I would, but it&#39;s fine. I like to see him being so independent. I enjoy the excitement in his voice when he shares his firsts. First big purchases, first moving from an apartment to a house. He said he really appreciated that we always had milk and toilet paper, now that he sees that it&#39;s something someone has to think about and do.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith, Holly and I drove out to visit him in his apartment. Holly has been a couple of other times, flying. Keith and I are visiting again in Spring, to see the house he shares with three co-workers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings like Facebook, Skype and cellphones help a lot with separations. We&#39;re never completely apart.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think when the child leaves naturally and positively, for a good reason, and the parents were willing to have him stay longer, there are fewer regrets and frustrations than under other circumstances. When kids are small, the mom is constantly on call. When Holly was born I had two and five year old boys. I know what it&#39;s like to have three young children. I also know what it&#39;s like to have three teens driving. But when they&#39;re calmly and confidently grown, the mom can leave for a month and they&#39;ll still be okay.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think when they get to be 19, 20, the feeling can come that they can take care of themselves, and they might feel crowded, and the parents might feel crowded.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have friends and relatives who basically threw their kids out at 18, or started charging them rent. I think that&#39;s cruel. It makes kids dread growing up, and that&#39;s not healthy.<br/>\n<br/>\nKim: Yes, I don&#39;t understand that at all (throwing kids out I mean).<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra: We figured a gradual, natural separation would be a better match for unschooling.  If we didn&#39;t call a halt to attachment parenting because a child turned five or six, why have a new artificial cut-off point at 18? It didn&#39;t make sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nKim: That makes so much sense. I&#39;ve worried about the day Lew moves out and I really shouldn&#39;t of course. Wasted energy. But I love your response. I&#39;ll hold onto that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":240358028,"authorName":"kristi_beguin","from":"&quot;kristi_beguin&quot; &lt;foehn_jye@...&gt;","profile":"kristi_beguin","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: &quot;Read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch.&quot;","postDate":"1294969496","msgId":58927,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlnbzlxbytoZWxlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDU3NjM5MS41MzIwNi5xbUB3ZWI4MzUwNS5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":58917,"nextInTopic":58977,"prevInTime":58926,"nextInTime":58928,"topicId":58818,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If you haven t read grown unschooler Idzie s blog, you might find her interviews of grown unschoolers, and links to other sites, informative, and possibly more","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1926078718\">If you haven&#39;t read grown unschooler Idzie&#39;s blog, you might find her interviews of grown unschoolers, and links to other sites, informative, and possibly more representative of what is discussed here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://yes-i-can-write.blogspot.com/2010/05/unschooling-grows-up-collection-of.html\">http://yes-i-can-write.blogspot.com/2010/05/unschooling-grows-up-collection-of.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd one of her more recent interviews invites other grown unschoolers to participate in the project.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://yes-i-can-write.blogspot.com/2011/01/grown-unschooler-jaclyn-dolamore-art.html\">http://yes-i-can-write.blogspot.com/2011/01/grown-unschooler-jaclyn-dolamore-art.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: &quot;Read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch.&quot;","postDate":"1294930550","msgId":58917,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEIwODQ2OEEzLTExQjgtNEI2MS04QkFFLTdENDJCMzU2NjIxNEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDM5MDkzOS4zNTU5OS5xbUB3ZWI4MzUwMS5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGlnZTl0MyszZzhhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NTc2MzkxLjUzMjA2LnFtQHdlYjgzNTA1Lm1haWwuc3AxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDgwNDM1MzIxLTkwMEMtNDhFQS1BMjk2LThFMEFEREI2MjdBMEBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4gPDM5MDkzOS4zNTU5OS5xbUB3ZWI4MzUwMS5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":58904,"nextInTopic":58927,"prevInTime":58916,"nextInTime":58918,"topicId":58818,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-My purpose for exploring Taylor is that she is an unschooled person, ...-=- If I could have one wish about homeschooling it would be that fundamentalist","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1715428421\">-=-My purpose for exploring Taylor is that she is an unschooled person, ...-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I could have one wish about homeschooling it would be that fundamentalist Christian creationists wouldn&#39;t be homeschooling their kids so they could tell them a pack of reconstructist lies.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had two wishes, it would be that people whose parents were not any good at ANY kind of homeschooling would stop saying &quot;I was unschooled.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are more people claiming to have unschooled than there are people who have done it really well.

It was about Holly being legally old enough in the state she lived in to get a tattoo on her own.  The difference between Holly (an unschooled teen) and myself (a schooled teen) is that she shared that moment with her parents.  They knew of her desire, and supported her choice, and she made a very responsible decision about her own body.  (The tattoo is beautiful!) I made a knee jerk, look at me I&#39;m old enough, you can&#39;t tell me what to do decision.  Thankfully, I still love my big tattoo, (and went on to get more!) and may love it even more after this discussion for what it will bring to mind now!  <br/>\n<br/>\n===The desire to explore adulthood is part of growing up and worthy of embracing===<br/>\n<br/>\n  Of course it is!! I will embrace that in my own children as it arrives (and it has already started!).  Hopefully, though, with what I have learned and what I will learn between now and their adulthood, my boys won&#39;t feel the need to make decisions in the way that I did, for the reasons that I did. I am on this path so that the relationship that I have with my boys is one built on honesty and trust and unconditional love, not on guilt and fear and manipulation.      <br/>\n<br/>\n====My purpose for exploring Taylor is that she is an unschooled person, and maybe<br/>\neven unschooled people, at 18yo====<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the interview with Astra - <br/>\n<br/>\n=== it&#39;s, &quot;you have to read that book on our shelf and you have to read them all out of love because you are just someone who loves to learn and if you don&#39;t love to learn well then you&#39;re just a loser.&#39; It&#39;s more complicated motivation. There has to be some element of guilt at work there. My mom used to always say, &quot;if you&#39;re bored you&#39;re boring.&quot; I didn&#39;t want to be boring.That isn&#39;t to say that trust isn&#39;t at work there either&quot;===<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom searching around on the internet and reading different library books, I have read many different ideas about what unschooling is, and how people live it in their lives.  I keep coming back to this list, and reading here, because this seems to be the version that resonates with me the most.  Especially all of the people with grown unschoolers who have gone through each and every stage of unschooling, and can offer advice with that wisdom in mind.  A year ago I could have called us &quot;Unschoolers&quot;, and the label would have sounded nice, but I am not sure it would have actually described what we were doing.  I could have told other people we were unschooling, and try to offer advice or argue my point, but I don&#39;t think it would have meant much.  Even now, I am hesitant to try to explain something to someone which I am still newly learning and living.  I guess what I mean is, if you are new to unschooling and really want to learn about it and live it, be mindful who you listen to when they describe unschooling to you.  If it doesn&#39;t look much like unschooling, the label doesn&#39;t make it so.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMolly Phipps </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: &quot;Read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch.&quot;","postDate":"1294807850","msgId":58886,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU0OUJFMDI1LTg1OEQtNDQ5NS1BNDlGLTUwNjdDODQ3RkM3Q0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDY3MTQzNS4yODYyMy5xbUB3ZWI4MzUwNy5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGlnZTl0MyszZzhhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NTc2MzkxLjUzMjA2LnFtQHdlYjgzNTA1Lm1haWwuc3AxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDgwNDM1MzIxLTkwMEMtNDhFQS1BMjk2LThFMEFEREI2MjdBMEBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4gPDM5MDkzOS4zNTU5OS5xbUB3ZWI4MzUwMS5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+IDw0NDUxMTEuNTI2MjMucW1Ad2ViMTEwNDExLm1haWwuZ3ExLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDY3MTQzNS4yODYyMy5xbUB3ZWI4MzUwNy5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":58885,"nextInTopic":58887,"prevInTime":58885,"nextInTime":58887,"topicId":58818,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I think Holly was doing what she wanted to do and could do without adult consent.

Chamille is out and about most days. <br/>\n She&#39;s very independent.  Her friends range in age from 13-30 and she fits right <br/>\nin with a mix that generally lands in the middle.  Some of her friends are <br/>\nalready adults.  At 16, she finds that she relates more with adults than she <br/>\ndoes with younger people.  She has a few really good friends that are younger <br/>\nand a handful of friends that go to school.  In general, she gets along better <br/>\nwith kids that don&#39;t go to school, so that is usually older people.  This is a <br/>\nnew transition.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think she is breaking free.  I don&#39;t think she will ever feel that.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think Holly waiting until the age of 18 was about breaking free.  It was <br/>\nthe age that she could legally get a tattoo on her own accord.  That was my <br/>\nunderstanding.  By the end of the month there will be a girl living with us that <br/>\nis needing to break free, has broken free, but has no place to go and be safe <br/>\ndoing that.  Having opened my house to lots of kids, I&#39;m not going into this <br/>\nblindly.  We&#39;ve been openly talking with the girl and her mom for about 3 months <br/>\nnow.  She&#39;s, in a sense, at the same sort of transition that my daughter is in, <br/>\nneeding to be out there, but still needing the comforts of a soft landing and a <br/>\ncozy nest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish more parents would give that to their kids.  Chamille meets a LOT of <br/>\ncouch surfers, young adults, that for whatever reason aren&#39;t able to continue <br/>\nbeing in their safe nests until they are able and ready to jump into the <br/>\nadult/self sufficient world.  Sometimes I wish I had more couches, more rooms, <br/>\nmore money to feed people.  I&#39;m in the business of nest building!  Right at this <br/>\nmoment, Margaux and Chamille are playing video games together with one of our <br/>\ncouch surfers.  There is happy calm going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a common theme among the kids that end up at our house.  They aren&#39;t <br/>\nhappy, their lives have been a series of preventable struggles and survival. <br/>\n EVERYone of the kids, and I use that term loosely, that end up here say that <br/>\nthey like it here because there is happiness and calm and it feels like what a <br/>\nfamily should feel like.  If Chamille wasn&#39;t the person she is, I wouldn&#39;t be <br/>\ndoing what I&#39;m doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things that I&#39;m avoiding is for my children to need to break free. <br/>\n They are free already.  Chamille has always been free, but has chosen not to <br/>\nuse her freedom until recently.  I really think that kids who are supported in <br/>\nall that they do won&#39;t need to break free.  What is there to break free from?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know Taylor.  Perhaps her needing to break free had more to do with <br/>\nexploring a world that wasn&#39;t yet available.  Perhaps, when she got there, she <br/>\nfelt free because that is what exploring does.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":67727291,"authorName":"wtexans","from":"&quot;wtexans&quot; &lt;wtexans@...&gt;","profile":"wtexans","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: &quot;Read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch.&quot;","postDate":"1294781012","msgId":58882,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlnaWhvaytkNmg4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDM5MDkzOS4zNTU5OS5xbUB3ZWI4MzUwMS5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":58881,"nextInTopic":58883,"prevInTime":58881,"nextInTime":58883,"topicId":58818,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"===My purpose for exploring Taylor is that she is an unschooled person, and maybe even unschooled people, at 18yo (as Sandra illustrated in her post about","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1829898533\">===My purpose for exploring Taylor is that she is an unschooled person, and maybe even unschooled people, at 18yo (as Sandra illustrated in her post about Holly&#39;s tattoo) will feel like &quot;breaking free&quot;, even if just a bit.===<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Breaking free&quot; is a negative phrase, though.

Perhaps being captivated by a project I  <br/>\nhad going that day, make video, finish a book, maybe just did nothing  <br/>\nbut kick up dirt and sit on the porch. Each day you had to face this  <br/>\nblank canvas and say �What am I going to do with my time.�<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: Were your parents involved in guiding you to figure that stuff out  <br/>\neveryday? Or was it basically just up to you?<br/>\n<br/>\nA: It was basically up to us... (She does go on to say they had books,  <br/>\ninstruments, paper, pens and paints and could ask their parents for  <br/>\nhelp).<br/>\n<br/>\nI don�t think you can unschool half-way. I think you really have to  <br/>\nsomehow make your kid believe that it�s all up to them. The trick is  <br/>\nthat, it doesn�t mean that your kid is totally free to flower and to  <br/>\ngrow, it�s much more reverse psychology. �Not only do you have to  <br/>\nlearn, but you have to love to learn.� The message is in a way even  <br/>\nmore twisted. It�s not, �You have to read this book and take this test  <br/>\nbecause that�s the way it is. And you have to get an A or else you�re  <br/>\ngonna fail- sorry that�s just the rules.� Instead it�s, �you have to  <br/>\nread that book on our shelf and you have to read them all out of love  <br/>\nbecause you are just someone who loves to learn and if you don�t love  <br/>\nto learn well then you�re just a loser.� It�s more complicated  <br/>\nmotivation. There has to be some element of guilt at work there. My  <br/>\nmom used to always say, �if you�re bored you�re boring.� I didn�t want  <br/>\nto be boring. That isn�t to say that trust isn�t at work there either.<br/>\n<br/>\n*****************<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is *not* the unschooling we talk about here. These are *not* the  <br/>\nmessages we are giving our children.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If she had felt that she was &quot;weird&quot;, which she says that she did,  <br/>\n&gt; and her<br/>\n&gt; parents were supportive of &quot;weird&quot; but not of &quot;mainstream&quot;, then her  <br/>\n&gt; need to<br/>\n&gt; rebel against that to feel &quot;normal&quot; was probably pretty strong<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Learning isn&#39;t weird. And no one here is saying support &quot;weird&quot; over  <br/>\n&quot;mainstream.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling doesn&#39;t preclude living in the world.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, even if a parent is supportive, embracing of a child&#39;s  <br/>\n&gt; interests, trusts the<br/>\n&gt; child&#39;s ability to learn, etc. etc., it may be that *that* child  <br/>\n&gt; still will feel<br/>\n&gt; the need to escape from or be free of parents and family once they  <br/>\n&gt; hit their<br/>\n&gt; teens and twenties.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t seen that with any of the grown unschoolers I know.

I came home, and when my mom saw it she pointed and yelled &quot;That better not be real&quot;.  It was, of course.  My reasoning?  Well, I am 18 now, Mom.  I can finally make my own decisions!  I had been working since I was 16, paid my own bills, completed my high school courses early and went on to the community college all before the age of 18.  Despite all that, in my life that &quot;ominous 18&quot; was the point in which my parents would *finally* release me.  I moved out a few weeks later to make the full escape.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a certain level of healing knowing that a lot of my childhood won&#39;t be repeated in my children&#39;s lives.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;Read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch.&quot;","postDate":"1294496194","msgId":58820,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJBMDExNDBELTlBQzYtNDhDNi1CRDMxLUEwRTBERDRCNDQ2QUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlnOWRqcCs1cWduQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlnOWRqcCs1cWduQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58819,"nextInTopic":58851,"prevInTime":58819,"nextInTime":58821,"topicId":58818,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is beautiful.

It turns out that a person is just about the very same the day of his 18th birthday as he was the day before.  Unschoolers can live toward helping a child stay whole so that 18 is no particular landmark in his life, nor something to be feared or dreaded.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen finances (government benefits or child support) are an issue, that&#39;s separate from a parentally-imposed or culturally-assumed &quot;just until you&#39;re 18 and then no more) stance.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy eighteen year olds (the three I&#39;ve had in my house) were more mature than many others their age, and at the same time they were more childlike.  I could say that of their whole lives, though, before and after &quot;eighteen.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- Jayden has spent time doing his usual video games, but has also suddenly started showing interest in other things as well.

A new game might come out and he&#39;ll go into immersion  mode again. :-)  Or he might be a little fluish, or stressed about something, and want to escape into patterns and sounds rather than words and people&#39;s faces for a day or three.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would guess might have happened, though, is that he finally believed that you really wouldn&#39;t remove the game from him, or him from the game, just because he stopped for a moment.  You gave him choices and now you&#39;re seeing him make choices in a thoughtful or joyful way, rather than in a reactionary or desperate way, maybe.   <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Yesterday, he got a play tent out, packed bags for both him and his two year old brother, got flashlights for both of them, and set out on a camping trip in their bedroom. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat kind of play can be the best.

That, and to go BE with your children, without expectations.  We are very new to unschooling.  We looked into it for a long time, trying to learn the &quot;rules&quot; of being an unschooler.  I wanted to BE that person. We started deschooling, and made a beginners mistake of taking most of the rules and throwing them out.  That&#39;s what unschoolers do, right?  I probably should have read into that part a little further!  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt took time, and is still a work in progress, but we have figured out what works for OUR family, for OUR kids, to make all of us as happy and content as possible.  We have spent more time just being with our kids (and enjoying it immensely) than we ever have.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur 8 year old son has immersed himself in several video games as well as internet games.  He has been making his own food choices, which for the most part are very healthy.  He does like to sit and eat an entire box of cookies from time to time, but so does his dad! <br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t sat down and practiced handwriting with him, but I am sitting here looking at his notebook that he writes his passwords and notes for his computer games in.  I know what each one is for, and when it was that he wrote them.  Without any coercion, his handwriting has changed and improved so much in the last six months.  He has been writing when it&#39;s necessary to him, to what he is doing.  He hasn&#39;t had to worry about whether he starts his &quot;e&quot; at the top of the line or the middle.  I showed him his dad&#39;s handwriting the other day, and we both giggled about it.  I think his is already more legible!<br/>\n<br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t type yet with all his fingers on the keys like I do, but he tells me he wants to learn how.  We got a program for that, but he isn&#39;t interested in it at the time.  I have noticed, though, that the past few weeks when he is typing, his eyes don&#39;t search for the letter location as much.  He is starting to know where they are located on the keyboard!  Faster finger pecking! <br/>\n<br/>\nWe haven&#39;t had spelling tests, or required reading, but he is reading! Big words that have never been taught to him, as well as small everyday words.  He isn&#39;t so much into sitting down and reading a book, but those games sure do have a lot of words!  Knowing what they say makes game playing much easier.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was one of those that was convinced that he may actually play the video and computer games non stop until he is 18.  I made sure to be okay with that, to look at what he WAS learning from these, and to make him happy and comfortable while he was doing it.  Eight years of mainstream parenting as well as his years in preschool and school, I knew it was going to take some time to rebuild that relationship to what I wanted it to be.  I decided I was going to focus on that and not worry about what he was or wasn&#39;t doing right now.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason that I feel inclined to post today, is that this has been such an amazing last couple of weeks for us.  Jayden has spent time doing his usual video games, but has also suddenly started showing interest in other things as well.  I think he finally got all filled up on the games!  He has built a robot with just a helping extra set of hands from me.  He has been working on a electro gadget kit that he got, building all sorts of different circuits that do different cool things.  He has been thinking up plans for a video game he wants to create.  Yesterday, he got a play tent out, packed bags for both him and his two year old brother, got flashlights for both of them, and set out on a camping trip in their bedroom.  Today, he offered to vacuum up a big pile of stickers that Jaxon had one-by-one poked out of their holder.  He asked if I would pay him, and I gladly got a dollar out and offered it up.  He negotiated at two, but I stayed firm at one.  He then told me that he would vacuum even if I wasn&#39;t paying him.  He just wanted to do it for me!  <br/>\n<br/>\nAwhile back, I posted about his &#39;sudden outbursts of hyper activity&#39;.  I could see asking the same thing in regards to &#39;oppositional defiant disorder&#39;.  When in school, he could have been regarded as ADHD or ODD, but we never looked for a diagnosis. Though through our thoughts, and our words towards him, we WERE labeling him. Thank goodness we found unschooling instead.  In the past year, he has done a complete 180 just with lots of love from us, freedom to make his own choices, and trusting that we are here for him whatever he needs.  He has become the sweetest most protective big brother, and sometimes has to remind me when I am not being very kind.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am still deschooling, as so is my husband, so I am heading back to &quot;Read a little, try a little, wait a little, watch&quot;  but I feel like we are getting it.  Not only do I feel that, but the results speak for themselves.  Reading other people&#39;s accounts of what unschooling has done for them is not nearly as powerful as seeing it for yourself, firsthand, with your own family.  Happy kids, excited to learn new things, makes for happy adults, excited to learn new things.  This has been one of the best decisions we have made for our children, and our family as a whole. Thanks to all of you who put so much time and effort in to ensure that those of us who are new can learn to do the best for our children just as you have.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne last note:  Someone gave some advice recently regarding children throwing tantrums.  I don&#39;t know who it was, but they basically said that when their child acts in that way they try to love them up as much as possible.  My two year old was very upset today about laying down for a nap.  My instinct was to be angry with him because I was frustrated, but my inner voice heard that advice. I held him really snug and kissed and hugged him and told him I loved him.  He instantly calmed down, laid his head on my shoulder, and snuggled up to me.  So whoever shared that, thank you.  It made a really frustrating moment for both of us turn quickly into a happy peaceful moment.  That is what loving your kids &quot;too much&quot; does!  <br/>\n<br/>\nMolly Phipps in Iowa<br/>\nmama to Jayden (8) <br/>\nJaxon (2)<br/>\nand wife to Keith for nine years and counting!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58822,"nextTopicId":58981}}
