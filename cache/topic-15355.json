It&#39;s COOL!  <br/>\nCertainly reminded me of Roxana, whose obsessions led me to my own <br/>\n(shorter-lived) obsession, which led to me and Holly seeing Cats in London, with a <br/>\nfriend who had never been to any musicals in London (she lives there) and now goes <br/>\nall the time.  A couple of days ago she came to visit, and brought Holly the <br/>\nCD of a new musical there called Bombay Dreams, and so one influence continues <br/>\nto have an effect!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBy Angie (Angie) on Friday, June 27, 2003 - 11:59 am:<br/>\nMy dd (11) has always let her interests become all-consuming. It&#39;s just how <br/>\nshe explores things. By taking her &#39;obsessions&#39; to the next level, she always <br/>\nfinds new avenues, new experiences...sometimes new &#39;obsessions&#39;! <br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently, she is truly enamoured(sp?) by the broadway musical &quot;Cats&quot;. It is <br/>\nall she talks about. Every single thing that comes out of her mouth has <br/>\nsomething to do with the songs, the characters, or some other aspect of the musical <br/>\n&quot;Cats&quot;. I have to say that this does become rather ....tedious... after a <br/>\nwhile, but I encourage it. I have learned more about that musical than I could <br/>\nhave ever wanted to know. I had no idea that the musical was based on a book of <br/>\npoetry written by T.S. Elliot. Of course now she has all of the poems <br/>\nmemorized, along with learning new words like &#39;terpsichorean&#39;. <br/>\nShe has made 2 collars, a tail, and 2 wristbands, wearing them everywhere she <br/>\ngoes, and is very busy visiting websites of others who are equally obsessed <br/>\nwith &quot;Cats&quot; (and there are many...) She wants to begin making full scale, <br/>\nprofessional looking costumes, and has also become interested in makeup and wig <br/>\nmaking. She wants to learn how to knit her own leg warmers (it looks SO much <br/>\nbetter if they are knit, rather than crochet!). She has already begun <br/>\nbrainstorming ideas for her own original characters. All of this came about simply because <br/>\nshe watched the DVD at someones house one afternoon. I had nothing to do with <br/>\nit! <br/>\n<br/>\nWe just happened to find out the other day that the musical is actually <br/>\ncoming to a nearby city in December. Tickets go on sale in 4 days. When we learned <br/>\nthis, she actually broke down and cried tears of joy. I love that she can feel <br/>\nso passionate about her favorite things. The hard part is to keep other <br/>\npeople from saying &quot;Can&#39;t you please talk about ANYTHING ELSE!!!&quot; The joy she seems <br/>\nto find in sharing her knowledge is worth so much. I&#39;d not want anyone else <br/>\nto dampen her enthusiasm in any way. Just a year ago, I, myself, might have <br/>\nsaid something snarky, but I am learning to bite my tongue and not limit her <br/>\nspirit with my comments. With unschooling, any interest can become a full fledged <br/>\npassion, and any passion can become a life altering experience. There is so <br/>\nmuch &#39;learning&#39; taking place in the name of Joy. I can&#39;t begin to describe how <br/>\nwonderful this has been for us. And it hasn&#39;t even been a year! <br/>\n<br/>\nAngie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15341,"nextTopicId":15368}}
