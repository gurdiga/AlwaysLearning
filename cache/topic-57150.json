She cares for my  <br/>\n&gt; daughters every Friday, and I know this is the biggest challenge of  <br/>\n&gt; her week. She is going very much outside her comfort zone (previous  <br/>\n&gt; authoritative, disciplinarian methods of child-rearing) to learn  <br/>\n&gt; about unschooling and responding without punishing. But she is doing  <br/>\n&gt; so graciously and respectfully, and I absolutely feel thankful for  <br/>\n&gt; her willingness to do so and for her desire to help me by being with  <br/>\n&gt; my girls one day a week while we work. She thoroughly supports our  <br/>\n&gt; unschooling choice, and that alone is priceless.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My husband and I are non-religious, and we do not often discuss  <br/>\n&gt; religious ideas or principals in our house. My Mother asked me years  <br/>\n&gt; ago if it was okay for her to give them books, music, or DVDs of  <br/>\n&gt; Christian perspective, and I said it was fine. I have not wanted to  <br/>\n&gt; offend her desire to sing songs with them, read to them, etc. and up  <br/>\n&gt; until now, they never had issue with it. I was raised by her, and so  <br/>\n&gt; I have a pretty good idea of how she interacts with them with  <br/>\n&gt; regards to reading, singing, and the sort. Mostly she just plays  <br/>\n&gt; with my girls--they play games, they run around, they sing songs,  <br/>\n&gt; they go to the park, they go out to eat. She&#39;s not doing Bible  <br/>\n&gt; study, or Sunday-school type stuff at all, mostly singing Christian  <br/>\n&gt; songs and listening to CDs in the car.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Recently, Nena (age 8) told me that she was tired of listening to  <br/>\n&gt; the few bible song CDs my Mom plays while they are driving. I  <br/>\n&gt; suggested she ask her Grandma if she would be willing to play some  <br/>\n&gt; of the other CDs that Nena enjoys, and so she did, and Grandma was  <br/>\n&gt; okay with it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As an aside, my husband is a professional drummer and plays in a  <br/>\n&gt; variety of bands and genres, but most recently was playing in a  <br/>\n&gt; death metal band. My kids love the music, and actually wrote their  <br/>\n&gt; own lyrics to the death metal music, and created their own dance  <br/>\n&gt; routines, which were really good. My husband listens to a lot of  <br/>\n&gt; different kinds of music, including death metal, punk rock, thrash,  <br/>\n&gt; and many other genres, some of which has lyrics that I am certain my  <br/>\n&gt; daughters have picked out, such as Slayer&#39;s &quot;God hates us all.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, when Nena told her Dad about telling Grandma that she wanted  <br/>\n&gt; to listen more to her music and not the Bible music, my husband made  <br/>\n&gt; some comments about God and not really believing in religion, etc.  <br/>\n&gt; They weren&#39;t particularly striking to me, but apparently they were  <br/>\n&gt; to Signe, who is 4. The next time Signe saw Grandma, and Grandma  <br/>\n&gt; asked if they wanted to listen to the Bible songs, Signe said, &quot;You  <br/>\n&gt; know, God isn&#39;t real.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My Mom confronted me about it, and told me that while it&#39;s none of  <br/>\n&gt; her business how we choose to raise our kids, that if I am going to  <br/>\n&gt; teach my children about God, I better start doing it now because  <br/>\n&gt; they are obviously being influenced somewhere about it, and not in a  <br/>\n&gt; good way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I respectfully side-stepped the conversation, and forgot about it  <br/>\n&gt; until today. She had watched my girls Friday, and apparently they  <br/>\n&gt; had made several comments to her about God and other controversial  <br/>\n&gt; topics such as ghosts, witches, and Halloween. My Mom was notably  <br/>\n&gt; upset, and took several days to mull it over before bringing it up  <br/>\n&gt; with me today.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So...basically, I would like to bring up the subject with my girls  <br/>\n&gt; on how we can be kind and respectful to Grandma about her beliefs,  <br/>\n&gt; but I would like to do so in a way that discourages them from  <br/>\n&gt; further upsetting their Grandma. With Signe, almost any discussion  <br/>\n&gt; of something I don&#39;t want her to do will lead to her doing it more,  <br/>\n&gt; which may be a developmental stage, but I&#39;ve noticed it quite a bit  <br/>\n&gt; in the past couple months. With Nena, the actual discussion of a  <br/>\n&gt; controversial topic will cause her to dismiss it and not want to  <br/>\n&gt; discuss it at all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any ideas on how I can approach this subject/concept with my two  <br/>\n&gt; girls? I&#39;m feeling like I need some help with this one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance.<br/>\n&gt; Kristi<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Joyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Ideas for Respecting Grandma&#39;s Beliefs","postDate":"1284075393","msgId":57180,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVGQ0JFRkNGLTQxNjgtNDk1MC05RUYwLUQzM0Q5OENFNDRERUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGk2YnA4bSt1cjBqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGk2YnA4bSt1cjBqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57179,"nextInTopic":57181,"prevInTime":57179,"nextInTime":57181,"topicId":57150,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-If only the OP s mother could show the same equanimity towards non- belief as is being advocated here for religious beliefs-=- Are you really not","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-284332770\">-=-If only the OP&#39;s mother could show the same equanimity towards non- <br/>\nbelief as is being advocated here for religious beliefs-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you really not understanding that for Christians they&#39;re not just  <br/>\ntwo equal items on the buffet of life?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you really do believe that religion is bogus, then how could it  <br/>\nhurt your children to hear Bible stories or whatever?

And I&#39;m not sitting them down and saying that we think there is no God, and therefore what we say is the Truth.

In a kind, gentle way, I think you should explain to your mum how you plan to approach the topic of religion with your children.

I realize that my 4yr old is trying things out and getting a shock value in return, which may be encouraging to her to try it more. It may take more skill on my part to help her to understand why I want her to not make these statements about God to her. <br/>\n<br/>\nLast night before we fell asleep, I asked Nena if I could talk to her about Grandma and about her feelings for God and Jesus, and Nena listened to me calmly and even asked a few questions about it. This morning, she told me how much she loves her Grandma and wants her to feel safe.  I thought that was really, really cool. Perhaps I&#39;ll bring it up again on occasion, to remind her of my feelings about how much we appreciate my Mom&#39;s support.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;My recommendation is to tell Grandma how much you appreciate her for being so respectful and that you realize it is hard, given her beliefs. Tell her you don&#39;t mind the girls being exposed to her beliefs at all, as long as she doesn&#39;t try to force them, as you know she won&#39;t. Tell her that the girls are going to be exposed to a lot of different ideas and she should not get upset when she hears all kinds of ideas from them, that they will try out all kinds of things and, when they&#39;re older, they&#39;ll make their own decisions.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is good.  My Mom&#39;s beliefs are deeply rooted, and she also appreciates that I understand her so well because neither my brother nor my father believe as she does, and I&#39;ve always been her kind-hearted and understanding listener in the family. She also knows that my husband&#39;s family is pretty brash, vocal, and liberal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;She probably is thinking, &quot;Oh no - it is time, if they don&#39;t get the christianity now, they might be lost forever.&quot; Reassure her that you&#39;re going to encourage them to think for themselves and that includes learning about Christianity along with other points of view.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a helpful way of saying it. I&#39;ve often been at a loss of how to approach it, and I often side-step the conversation by just nodding in agreement to what she is saying and then changing the subject. She has never pressed any of the religious principals she feels strongly about on us, until that one conversation I mentioned.  She is also convinced that the predictions of the Book of Revelations are starting to occur, and believes so strongly that my children must be saved in order to go to Heaven.  While I do not agree with her perspective on this, I feel strongly about not being rude and not setting up an environment here where she feels terribly conflicted.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your thoughtful comments, Pam.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":240358028,"authorName":"kristi_beguin","from":"&quot;kristi_beguin&quot; &lt;foehn_jye@...&gt;","profile":"kristi_beguin","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Ideas for Respecting Grandma&#39;s Beliefs","postDate":"1283969807","msgId":57158,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGk2OGp1ZitxNzNrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGk2Nm03aCtxdWhsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57157,"nextInTopic":57159,"prevInTime":57157,"nextInTime":57159,"topicId":57150,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

She thoroughly supports our<br/>\n&gt; unschooling choice, and that alone is priceless.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My husband and I are non-religious, and we do not often discuss religious<br/>\n&gt; ideas or principals in our house. My Mother asked me years ago if it was<br/>\n&gt; okay for her to give them books, music, or DVDs of Christian perspective,<br/>\n&gt; and I said it was fine. I have not wanted to offend her desire to sing songs<br/>\n&gt; with them, read to them, etc. and up until now, they never had issue with<br/>\n&gt; it. I was raised by her, and so I have a pretty good idea of how she<br/>\n&gt; interacts with them with regards to reading, singing, and the sort. Mostly<br/>\n&gt; she just plays with my girls--they play games, they run around, they sing<br/>\n&gt; songs, they go to the park, they go out to eat. She&#39;s not doing Bible study,<br/>\n&gt; or Sunday-school type stuff at all, mostly singing Christian songs and<br/>\n&gt; listening to CDs in the car.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Recently, Nena (age 8) told me that she was tired of listening to the few<br/>\n&gt; bible song CDs my Mom plays while they are driving. I suggested she ask her<br/>\n&gt; Grandma if she would be willing to play some of the other CDs that Nena<br/>\n&gt; enjoys, and so she did, and Grandma was okay with it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As an aside, my husband is a professional drummer and plays in a variety of<br/>\n&gt; bands and genres, but most recently was playing in a death metal band. My<br/>\n&gt; kids love the music, and actually wrote their own lyrics to the death metal<br/>\n&gt; music, and created their own dance routines, which were really good. My<br/>\n&gt; husband listens to a lot of different kinds of music, including death metal,<br/>\n&gt; punk rock, thrash, and many other genres, some of which has lyrics that I am<br/>\n&gt; certain my daughters have picked out, such as Slayer&#39;s &quot;God hates us all.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, when Nena told her Dad about telling Grandma that she wanted to<br/>\n&gt; listen more to her music and not the Bible music, my husband made some<br/>\n&gt; comments about God and not really believing in religion, etc. They weren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; particularly striking to me, but apparently they were to Signe, who is 4.<br/>\n&gt;  The next time Signe saw Grandma, and Grandma asked if they wanted to listen<br/>\n&gt; to the Bible songs, Signe said, &quot;You know, God isn&#39;t real.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My Mom confronted me about it, and told me that while it&#39;s none of her<br/>\n&gt; business how we choose to raise our kids, that if I am going to teach my<br/>\n&gt; children about God, I better start doing it now because they are obviously<br/>\n&gt; being influenced somewhere about it, and not in a good way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I respectfully side-stepped the conversation, and forgot about it until<br/>\n&gt; today. She had watched my girls Friday, and apparently they had made several<br/>\n&gt; comments to her about God and other controversial topics such as ghosts,<br/>\n&gt; witches, and Halloween. My Mom was notably upset, and took several days to<br/>\n&gt; mull it over before bringing it up with me today.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So...basically, I would like to bring up the subject with my girls on how<br/>\n&gt; we can be kind and respectful to Grandma about her beliefs, but I would like<br/>\n&gt; to do so in a way that discourages them from further upsetting their<br/>\n&gt; Grandma. With Signe, almost any discussion of something I don&#39;t want her to<br/>\n&gt; do will lead to her doing it more, which may be a developmental stage, but<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve noticed it quite a bit in the past couple months.

I had an uncle who went so  <br/>\ntotally &quot;new age&quot; that his daughters would have nothing to do with  <br/>\nhim.  He had been a Baptist preacher when they were kids.  My  <br/>\ngrandmother, whose large family was filled with ministers, was proud  <br/>\nof him for having graduated from Hardin Simmons, a Baptist college  <br/>\nwhere I had planned to apply myself; my pool was St. John&#39;s, Hardin- <br/>\nSimmons or UNM.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know many former fundamentalists and Roman Catholics who grew up  <br/>\n&quot;brainwashed&quot; and forced to attend, comply, and conform.  Some of them  <br/>\njust relax into the church for life.  Others do a 180 degree turnabout  <br/>\nand walk as far away from it as they can.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps that&#39;s not the choice Pam meant by &quot;can&#39;t really choose,&quot; but  <br/>\nit IS a choice.

They knew not to razz or shame  <br/>\nanother person for an interest.  Maybe if it&#39;s treated as a &quot;favorite  <br/>\nthing&quot; or an attachment, rather than a cosmic, historical, socio- <br/>\npolitical thing, it will be easier to talk with the kid about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Ideas for Respecting Grandma&#39;s Beliefs","postDate":"1283908810","msgId":57152,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRDODZFNENBLjMwMzAyMDZAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGk2Nm03aCtxdWhsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGk2Nm03aCtxdWhsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57151,"nextInTopic":57153,"prevInTime":57151,"nextInTime":57153,"topicId":57150,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

She cares for my daughters every Friday, and I know this is the biggest challenge of her week. She is going very much outside her comfort zone (previous authoritative, disciplinarian methods of child-rearing) to learn about unschooling and responding without punishing. But she is doing so graciously and respectfully, and I absolutely feel thankful for her willingness to do so and for her desire to help me by being with my girls one day a week while we work. She thoroughly supports our unschooling choice, and that alone is priceless.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I are non-religious, and we do not often discuss religious ideas or principals in our house. My Mother asked me years ago if it was okay for her to give them books, music, or DVDs of Christian perspective, and I said it was fine. I have not wanted to offend her desire to sing songs with them, read to them, etc. and up until now, they never had issue with it. I was raised by her, and so I have a pretty good idea of how she interacts with them with regards to reading, singing, and the sort. Mostly she just plays with my girls--they play games, they run around, they sing songs, they go to the park, they go out to eat. She&#39;s not doing Bible study, or Sunday-school type stuff at all, mostly singing Christian songs and listening to CDs in the car.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRecently, Nena (age 8) told me that she was tired of listening to the few bible song CDs my Mom plays while they are driving. I suggested she ask her Grandma if she would be willing to play some of the other CDs that Nena enjoys, and so she did, and Grandma was okay with it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs an aside, my husband is a professional drummer and plays in a variety of bands and genres, but most recently was playing in a death metal band. My kids love the music, and actually wrote their own lyrics to the death metal music, and created their own dance routines, which were really good. My husband listens to a lot of different kinds of music, including death metal, punk rock, thrash, and many other genres, some of which has lyrics that I am certain my daughters have picked out, such as Slayer&#39;s &quot;God hates us all.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, when Nena told her Dad about telling Grandma that she wanted to listen more to her music and not the Bible music, my husband made some comments about God and not really believing in religion, etc. They weren&#39;t particularly striking to me, but apparently they were to Signe, who is 4.  The next time Signe saw Grandma, and Grandma asked if they wanted to listen to the Bible songs, Signe said, &quot;You know, God isn&#39;t real.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy Mom confronted me about it, and told me that while it&#39;s none of her business how we choose to raise our kids, that if I am going to teach my children about God, I better start doing it now because they are obviously being influenced somewhere about it, and not in a good way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI respectfully side-stepped the conversation, and forgot about it until today. She had watched my girls Friday, and apparently they had made several comments to her about God and other controversial topics such as ghosts, witches, and Halloween. My Mom was notably upset, and took several days to mull it over before bringing it up with me today.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...basically, I would like to bring up the subject with my girls on how we can be kind and respectful to Grandma about her beliefs, but I would like to do so in a way that discourages them from further upsetting their Grandma.
