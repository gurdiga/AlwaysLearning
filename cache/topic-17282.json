Back from our great weekend adventure under the stars <br/>\nand the beautiful total lunar eclipse.  We just had the Jane Goodall <br/>\nexhibit at our Museum Center so we had recently learned all about <br/>\nRoots and Shoots.  Here is the web site with all the information:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.janegoodall.org/rs/\">http://www.janegoodall.org/rs/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt is pretty basic, not much indoctrination at all.  There are a <br/>\nbunch of links at the bottom of the web page on how to start <br/>\nsomething in your area.    <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother great organization to get behind is The Heifer Project.  If <br/>\nyou aren&#39;t familiar with them check them out at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.heifer.org\">http://www.heifer.org</a><br/>\nLots of learning potential with this organization.  Kids love to find <br/>\nout about the animals, even visit farms where they can learn more.  <br/>\nOne year we visited a great high-tech dairy goat farm as part of our <br/>\ninvolvement in The Heifer Project, buying some dairy goats for a <br/>\nfamily.  Then another year we visited a dairy farm that had different <br/>\nanimals and happened into one barn just at the moment when a doe was <br/>\nkidding, two kids!  Wow!  Our homeschoolers watched every last moment <br/>\nof it all.  Great biology lesson.  Another year when we were buying <br/>\nsheep we had volunteers from the local Weavers Guild come and talk to <br/>\nus about sheep, bringing samples of sheep&#39;s milk and sheep&#39;s cheese, <br/>\nas well as fleece for us to card and spin from a drop spindle.  <br/>\nNeat!  The bees could be interesting, too, visiting an apiary, but we <br/>\nhaven&#39;t done that yet.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then there are the Spiral Scouts.  I am not much into <br/>\norganizations that require uniforms, and Spiral Scouts do, so we <br/>\ndeclined this one, but it certainly is not paramilitary, by any <br/>\nstretch of the imagination.  To learn more go to:   <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aquatabch.org/spiralscouts/\">http://www.aquatabch.org/spiralscouts/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLast, but not least, is 4-H.  You can usually start your own club <br/>\nwith only two kids.  And whether or not your kids go to the fairs or <br/>\nparticipate in the countywide activities is up to you and them.  Up <br/>\nto a point it is good.  In some parts of the country it is better <br/>\nthan others.  But 4-H even has college scholarships and a exchange <br/>\nprograms with other countries, too.   We loved creating our own self-<br/>\ndetermined projects, as much as any of the ones offered in our state <br/>\nproject catalog.
