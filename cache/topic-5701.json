And the child-rearing years aren&#39;t <br/>\nforever, either, by the way  - so people can take time out of other careers <br/>\nto homeschool their kids. Here are a number of scenarios:<br/>\n<br/>\nA woman goes to college or pursues a career while in her 20&#39;s and has two <br/>\nchildren at 30 and 32 years old. For then next 13 years she devotes all her <br/>\ntime to being a homeschooling mom and then, when her youngest is 13 and mom <br/>\nis 43, she returns to her career on a part-time basis for the next five years <br/>\nand then, at 48, she returns full time.<br/>\n<br/>\nFather and mother both continue to pursue full-time careers, juggling <br/>\nschedules so one of them is always available to the kids. Exhausting, but <br/>\npeople do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFather and/or mother creates a home-based business so that one or both can be <br/>\navailable to the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nMom has kids young - the last one by the time she is, say, 22. When her <br/>\nyoungest is about 13, mom is 35 and she decides to start her own business. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr, maybe the 35 yo mom decides to go to college and she takes her time and <br/>\ngraduates when she is 40, ready to launch a new career now that her youngest <br/>\nchild is 18.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr maybe, like me, mom pursues college, grad school, and full-time career and <br/>\nthen has her kids while in her 30&#39;s and, at that time, cuts down to a small <br/>\namount of part-time work in her field. Maybe she&#39;ll go back full-time when <br/>\nher youngest is grown - or maybe she&#39;ll just stick with the part-time level <br/>\nuntil she retires. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr maybe mom continues to work full-time and dad pursues part-time work in <br/>\nHIS field so that he can spend considerable time with the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - those are examples that you could use. But what I resent about this is <br/>\nthe implication that homeschooling/parenting is not a productive pursuit <br/>\nitself. That is so sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd a society that was more child-friendly would be one where it was even <br/>\nEASIER to move more flexibly in and out of other kinds of productive <br/>\nactivities.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] if everyone homeschooled....","postDate":"1016766287","msgId":5714,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk2LjIzYTU5ODU3LjI5Y2JmOTRmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5706,"nextInTopic":5722,"prevInTime":5713,"nextInTime":5715,"topicId":5701,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/21/02 2:23:23 PM, freeform@juno.com writes:  agrarian, probably was meant","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2447033\">In a message dated 3/21/02 2:23:23 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:freeform@...\">freeform@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; What is a gregarian society? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nagrarian, probably was meant</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":86305879,"authorName":"Amy Scott","from":"&quot;Amy Scott&quot; &lt;info@...&gt;","profile":"benjalo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] if everyone homeschooled....","postDate":"1016759457","msgId":5704,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PE5HQkJJTkVOQ0xFRFBPQ0RDRk9DR0VIQ0NKQUEuaW5mb0B3ZWFyc3RoZWJhYnkuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDIwMzIxLjEzMTMzMS4tMjc5ODg5LjAuZnJlZWZvcm1AanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5703,"nextInTopic":5705,"prevInTime":5703,"nextInTime":5705,"topicId":5701,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... i m thinking agrarian","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1231092056\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; What is a gregarian society? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>i&#39;m thinking agrarian</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":9440128,"authorName":"ElissaJC@concentric.net","from":"&lt;ElissaJC@...&gt;","profile":"elissajc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] if everyone homeschooled....","postDate":"1016751391","msgId":5706,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyZjAwMWMxZDEyYiRhNTliNDVhMCQ2MjM4YWRjZUBFbGlzc2FKQz4="},"prevInTopic":5705,"nextInTopic":5714,"prevInTime":5705,"nextInTime":5707,"topicId":5701,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"the problem I see with the entire world choosing to homeschool or live on a farm is that we would revert to a gregarian society, and anarchy **And what s","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1045728984\">&quot;the problem I see with the entire world<br/>\nchoosing to homeschool or live on a farm is<br/>\nthat we would revert to a gregarian society,<br/>\nand anarchy<br/>\n**And what&#39;s wrong with that? ;o)<br/>\n&lt;&lt;as there would be no law makers<br/>\nor politicians, or law keepers, or<br/>\ngrocers..as all would be at home teaching our<br/>\nkids&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>\nALL of us? only about half really. and kids do grow up.<br/>\n~Elissa Cleaveland<br/>\n&quot;It is nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction<br/>\nhave<br/>\nnot yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry.&quot; A.
