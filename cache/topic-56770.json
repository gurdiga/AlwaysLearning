Without that tool, she&#39;s wide open to attack. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt looks like Georgia has several different possible avenues for &quot;graduation&quot;. Its worth looking into them, and checking with some umbrella schools. Some will accept a portfolio or interview and provide you with a diploma, others will likely want you to &quot;enroll&quot; for a year. The point, though, isn&#39;t to make your dd jump through more hoops, but to find her a tool she can use to get other people off her back.

Holly was talking just this afternoon (not in a  <br/>\npositive way) about some unschooled teens who seem to have no friends  <br/>\nother than other unschoolers, and it seemed they did NOT live in the  <br/>\nreal world.  (Holly has friends who were unschooled--tons of them.   <br/>\nShe has that many or more friends who did go to school.)   And knowing  <br/>\nsomeone who didn&#39;t go to school if it comes up naturally is okay (and  <br/>\nthat&#39;s part of what conferences are for; I don&#39;t know whether you went  <br/>\nto conferences when she was 16 or 17, but that would&#39;ve been the time  <br/>\nto get her connected with other teens), but unschooled kids don&#39;t have  <br/>\nany obligation to befriend someone who tried to but didn&#39;t really  <br/>\nquite unschool, nor even those who did unschool for 12  years.  That&#39;s  <br/>\nas little to base a friendship on as going to the same high school  <br/>\nis.  Some kids really do hit it off, and some don&#39;t, but the idea that  <br/>\nunschoolers have social obligations to other unschoolers can be  <br/>\nproblematical.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Young adult connections","postDate":"1281902931","msgId":56785,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg3NjkyMS44NjgxMC5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDQubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGk0OWRkNSs1dDFyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGk0OWRkNSs1dDFyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":56784,"nextInTopic":56786,"prevInTime":56784,"nextInTime":56786,"topicId":56770,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***She s happy to see a few of them go, but she ll miss the rest.
