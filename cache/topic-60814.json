I&#39;m probably not the only parent who sometimes<br/>\nfinds transitions a challenge. When I&#39;m writing a book, as I am now, I&#39;m &quot;in<br/>\nmy head&quot; a lot--immersed in the manuscript, thinking about the story,<br/>\nhearing the characters speak. I have a set time of day when I write & my<br/>\nhusband is the one spending time with the kids, and I try to fully emerge<br/>\nfrom book-world when *I&#39;m* the one with the children--to be present and<br/>\nmindful and fun. But the transition can be difficult; sometimes the<br/>\ncharacters in my head don&#39;t want to shut up!<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the years, I have developed certain habits for helping myself over<br/>\nthose transition moments from *focused on kids* to *focused on writing* and<br/>\nvice versa. I usually transition from kids-to-writing by writing *about* the<br/>\nkids for 15 or 20 minutes---that&#39;s how my blog came into being 6 years ago.<br/>\nThe writing-to-kids transition takes more mental effort, if I&#39;ve been deep<br/>\ninto the work--it can be a bit like when you wake up from a vivid dream and<br/>\nyou&#39;re groggy and distracted for a few minutes. Lately my favorite way to<br/>\nmake the transition is to visit your Just Add Light and Stir blog.
