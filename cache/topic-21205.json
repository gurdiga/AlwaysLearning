Every time I watch the school bus go by or talk to a<br/>\nhomeschool family who cant play because they arent done school yet, I<br/>\nthink to myself, we are *so* lucky!  What a life we have!  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe got our first horse two weeks ago.  My girls are 8 and almost 10 and they<br/>\nare horse crazy!  Our horse is boarded at a barn ½ mile from our house.  We<br/>\nare there first thing in the morning to clean her stall, groom her, and ride<br/>\nher most days. We go back and help shovel stalls later on and help feed and<br/>\nbring the horses in to their stalls. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we are home, we are either playing with friends, just playing, reading<br/>\nabout horses, watching horses on TV, or keeping the house running.  Weve<br/>\nbeen enjoying a new card game called Websters Word Madness.  The girls have<br/>\ngotten back into Zoo Tycoon and Roller Coaster Tycoon.  Theres a new Roller<br/>\nCoaster Tycoon  3 out with very cool graphics.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI have no worries that my girls wont learn what they need to know.  They<br/>\nare little sponges who absorb everything around them, as they need it.  It<br/>\nseems so natural to me.  It saddens me when I listen to other peoples<br/>\nconcerns for their childrens education.  They are missing out, in a big<br/>\nway, on today.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela ~ Maine<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Just joined :)- intro.","postDate":"1099759850","msgId":21207,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5NC4zMTQ1ZWNmNS4yZWJlNWFlYUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":21206,"nextInTopic":21208,"prevInTime":21206,"nextInTime":21208,"topicId":21205,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/6/04 9:43:32 AM, hlbhart@yahoo.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1398465131\">In a message dated 11/6/04 9:43:32 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hlbhart@...\">hlbhart@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I was just wondering how or what you all do as to -schooling or &quot;un-<br/>\n<br/>\nschooling&quot; each day?  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nForgot to mention...<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a collection of reports of unschooling days here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/typical\">http://sandradodd.com/typical</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Just joined :)- intro.","postDate":"1099759819","msgId":21206,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5OS4zMjVkNzRhNi4yZWJlNWFjYkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":21205,"nextInTopic":21207,"prevInTime":21205,"nextInTime":21207,"topicId":21205,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Our schedule involves appointments, people coming over, parties, movies needing to be returned, and when/whether Kirby (and lately Marty) has to work.
