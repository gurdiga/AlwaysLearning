Her current spot in the kitchen is not really all that<br/>\nsatisfactory to me or to her -- on the floor, looking up, missing out on<br/>\nthings.  She&#39;s not capable yet of moving stools and chairs around to get<br/>\nwhere she wants to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I come back to the safety problem with stools and chairs -- I try not<br/>\nto be too overprotective, but I can see her really hurting herself dragging<br/>\ncertain items of furniture around, at least at this age.  I think she would<br/>\nmore likely topple them over on herself right now.  I like the fact that<br/>\nthis product would allow her to be with me, doing stuff, NOW, rather than<br/>\nhaving to wait until she&#39;s 3 or 4 and more steady on a chair or stool, or<br/>\nable to drag it where she needed it.  She may do that anyway when she&#39;s<br/>\nolder, which is fine, and we&#39;ll just cross that bridge when we come to it.<br/>\nI like the fact that we could have two little ones on it at once, and I want<br/>\nto maximize that time by having it now rather than waiting until she can<br/>\nhandle moving stools and such herself.  Plus, in a way, when she&#39;s so little<br/>\nand can&#39;t move it, it wouldn&#39;t be much different than the permanent fixtures<br/>\nin the house like the counter tops, or a couch, or the piano.  Would it?  I<br/>\nliked the comment that one poster made about it giving her kiddo some<br/>\nexperience climbing and learning to experiment with clambering up and down a<br/>\nfairly secure piece of furniture -- my hunch is that my Josephine will love<br/>\nthat part of it, and she will build lots of good climbing skills.  I might<br/>\nalso guess that she&#39;ll transfer her climbing skills to other types of<br/>\nfurniture in the house, and that&#39;s okay.  She&#39;ll get lots of experimentation<br/>\nwith what works and what doesn&#39;t, and we&#39;re here to help her if she<br/>\nstruggles.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur kitchen setup is such that we don&#39;t have an eating area in there -- we<br/>\nhave a separate dining room where we have our meals, so we don&#39;t have a<br/>\ntable in our kitchen where we do prep.  I do everything at the counter tops<br/>\nand sink, and we use our dining room table for meals.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thought I had is that we have a farm/market garden business, and,<br/>\ndepending on how easy it is for us to move this thing around, we could also<br/>\nset it up in the greenhouse sometimes and she could help us, play around in<br/>\ndirt on the tables, or work with her own plants and things.  How cool would<br/>\nTHAT be?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know there may be ways to approximate the design, but I really think for<br/>\nmy time and money (especially if I can find one used or a little cheaper on<br/>\neBay or something), it sounds like it will be worth it.  If we get four or<br/>\nfive good years out of it, I&#39;ll be happy.

When my daughter got too big to sit at the kitchen counter in one of those portable high chairs that actually attach to the counter (she kicked away really hard one time and made the apparatus and herself crash to the floor, so that was the end of that)we put the learning tower in it&#39;s place and it is her favorite place to eat in the kitchen. She never liked to sit or kneel in a regular chair at the dining table, since it was never the right height to eat comfortably. But the tower is nice because when standing she was the right height to eat or play at the counter, and the height is adjustable of course. She learned to climb up into it early so she&#39;s very independent in that regard, and she pushes it to other locations on occasion. Sometimes the kids throw a blanket over it and make it like a cave. My daughter often balances her feet on various parts of it, trying out her physical skills and balance, it is very sturdy and not dangerous for her to experiment in this way. The retail price was really too expensive for us, but we were lucky enough to find one on Craigslist for a LOT less. You might do some looking around for a used one before you part with the $200. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Deborah McKee Kelly &lt;dlmckee@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi all.

I think she&#39;d like climbing on this... I got the<br/>\n&gt; link to the product from a Montessori site, and, although I&#39;m not any kind<br/>\n&gt; of Montessori purist, I do get a real kick out of a lot of the ideas, and I<br/>\n&gt; guess I aspire to involve the kids more.  When I saw this item, I got really<br/>\n&gt; excited -- it seems to accommodate kids from early toddlerhood clear up to<br/>\n&gt; age 6 or so, and from reviews I&#39;ve read, it can hold two little ones at<br/>\n&gt; once.  I&#39;m due with my second child in about a month, and I was thinking<br/>\n&gt; this *tower* could give both my littlest ones some early independence and<br/>\n&gt; access that they might not otherwise have.  But I am also a real sucker for<br/>\n&gt; Montessori stuff, so I have to watch myself or I&#39;d have a house full of<br/>\n&gt; well-marketed *items* like this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am probably over-eager to have my kids be involved with me in things.  I<br/>\n&gt; love having my daughter in the kitchen with me when I&#39;m working -- cooking,<br/>\n&gt; prepping, cleaning, whatever -- right now she stands at my legs and hangs<br/>\n&gt; on, looking up and wanting to be part of it all, and she doesn&#39;t do the wrap<br/>\n&gt; or carrier thing (not that I could hold her like that right now, with my<br/>\n&gt; pregnant belly).  She gets frustrated, and quickly bored with things I give<br/>\n&gt; her to do on the floor -- measuring cups, spoons, pitchers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From an unschooling perspective:  am I jumping the gun on expecting my<br/>\n&gt; babies to be part of activities in the kitchen?  My justification is that<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m in the kitchen a lot -- my little girl WANTS to be with me, and<br/>\n&gt; currently gets frustrated by all the stuff I&#39;m doing up high that she can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; be a part of.  Am I trying to justify the purchase of a product that is<br/>\n&gt; unnecessary?  (would step-stools work almost as well?)  The product<br/>\n&gt; marketing proclaims that this is better than a step-stool, because it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; safer, and it can also double as a little kind of jungle-gym, play-house,<br/>\n&gt; etc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s one more of my justifications before I turn it over to you all for<br/>\n&gt; advice:  my 9-year-old step-son, who is along with me on the deschooling<br/>\n&gt; journey at the moment (he&#39;s been traditionally home-schooled forever, and we<br/>\n&gt; started deschooling about four or five months ago), also LOVES being in the<br/>\n&gt; kitchen and wants to help all the time with cooking and such.  My<br/>\n&gt; 13-month-old wants to be in there with us, too, but she demands all the<br/>\n&gt; attention because she gets frustrated.  I think if I could have something<br/>\n&gt; like this to get her involved in a project up at our level, she would be<br/>\n&gt; easier to handle, and she and her big brother could even work together --<br/>\n&gt; which would be fun for him AND for her, because they really love each<br/>\n&gt; other.  These days, he and I kind of wait until she&#39;s down for a nap before<br/>\n&gt; we try to work together on a kitchen project, but then we have to be all<br/>\n&gt; quiet and everything, which is no fun.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This kitchen stuff has been a real de-schooling -- and scary -- area for me,<br/>\n&gt; because I grew up in a strict, perfect, clean house where my mother was the<br/>\n&gt; Kitchen Master, and I was not allowed in, because I was messy and too eager<br/>\n&gt; and too slow and... you get the idea.  I don&#39;t want that in my house.  I am<br/>\n&gt; still very intimidated in the kitchen, and just starting to overcome it,<br/>\n&gt; because my mom&#39;s voice is always whispering over my shoulder, &quot;Don&#39;t spill,<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t cut yourself, don&#39;t drip...&quot; etc.  I don&#39;t want to spend the next few<br/>\n&gt; years keeping my daughter and her little brother/sister (don&#39;t know the<br/>\n&gt; gender yet) trapped behind the gate, using my mom&#39;s same pattern of keeping<br/>\n&gt; them out because it&#39;s inconvenient or frustrating.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s my expense justification:  $200 divided by two children = $100,<br/>\n&gt; divided by 5 years of use = $20/year/child for a potentially cool item that<br/>\n&gt; could enhance our relationships and our kitchen activities.  And if you add<br/>\n&gt; in the extra bonus of my step-son getting to interact with his little<br/>\n&gt; siblings in the kitchen, well, that makes it even more affordable...right?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thoughts?  Ideas?  People who have used this or know of it?

She used it a lot to play at the sink. We didn&#39;t have stools or chairs that were sturdy enough for her at the time. The sides really kept her from falling, especially when the floor of the Learning Tower would get wet and slippery from her water play (when she was young I would also put a towel under her feet to absorb some of the water and keep her from slipping.) Our problem was that our kitchen is small and it really didn&#39;t fit well and it is heavy to move from a different room for storage. One thing to know is that although they are very sturdy and I have no doubt that an older version on Craigslist or Ebay would still be in excellent condition, the older versions do not collapse for storage, whereas the newer versions do collapse for storage. In fact, just today, my husband took ours apart to store in the garage until our second baby is about 15 months old and will start using it again. My daughter is now 4 and most of her kitchen help occurs while seated at the kitchen table. Looking back on it, most, if not all, of her kitchen help could have occurred there except for helping with dishes or water play at the sink. And now that she is older, we use a chair with arm sides and that is sturdy and safe enough now for using the sink. In a nutshell, if you have the space and can afford it, you will use it. I also think it would be very handy if you have two children who want to help at once. It is big enough to accommodate that. <br/>\n<br/>\nLaurie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":345152630,"authorName":"Julie van der Wekken","from":"&quot;Julie van der Wekken&quot; &lt;thewekkenfam@...&gt;","profile":"vegfam3","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Question re: &quot;The Learning Tower&quot;","postDate":"1271605634","msgId":52946,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhxZjlpMitsaTg5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PERCNjlGNzU0LTYxMTQtNDhGOC04RDFCLTI0QjU2MzgxOURDQ0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":52944,"nextInTopic":52949,"prevInTime":52945,"nextInTime":52947,"topicId":52919,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We purchased one when my now 8 year old was almost 2 I believe.

I actually acquired it from a neighbor who was going to donate it to Goodwill anyway, so she gave it to us for free - awesome deal!  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have two kids aged 4 and almost 2.  Before we got the Learning Tower, multiple times each day they were pushing dining room chairs into the kitchen to climb up onto so they could reach the countertop and sink and shelves and whatever else is up high in the kitchen.  I like the tower better because they can both fit in it and I don&#39;t worry about them falling off as much.  Our chairs don&#39;t have arms, and it was altogether too easy for them to bump each other off the chair.  Also, my younger one has more than once managed to &quot;bump&quot; himself off a chair even when he&#39;s the only one on it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Even if your daughter is too young to really help or be interested in helping with kitchen tasks, we find the tower is really great for water play in the sink.  I can cook a whole meal while my son plays with measuring cups and spoons and whatever else with a small stream of running water in the sink.  As far as &quot;jumping the gun,&quot; it sounds like your daughter could start using it right away already, so I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s a real concern.

Am I a sucker for a cool-looking product?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;From an unschooling perspective:  am I jumping the gun on expecting my babies to be part of activities in the kitchen?  My justification is that I&#39;m in the kitchen a lot -- my little girl WANTS to be with me, and currently gets frustrated by all the stuff I&#39;m doing up high that she can&#39;t be a part of.  Am I trying to justify the purchase of a product that is unnecessary?  (would step-stools work almost as well?)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n========================<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have the Learning Tower at our house.  I actually acquired it from a neighbor who was going to donate it to Goodwill anyway, so she gave it to us for free - awesome deal!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have two kids aged 4 and almost 2.  Before we got the Learning Tower, multiple times each day they were pushing dining room chairs into the kitchen to climb up onto so they could reach the countertop and sink and shelves and whatever else is up high in the kitchen.  I like the tower better because they can both fit in it and I don&#39;t worry about them falling off as much.  Our chairs don&#39;t have arms, and it was altogether too easy for them to bump each other off the chair.  Also, my younger one has more than once managed to &quot;bump&quot; himself off a chair even when he&#39;s the only one on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if your daughter is too young to really help or be interested in helping with kitchen tasks, we find the tower is really great for water play in the sink.  I can cook a whole meal while my son plays with measuring cups and spoons and whatever else with a small stream of running water in the sink.  As far as &quot;jumping the gun,&quot; it sounds like your daughter could start using it right away already, so I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s a real concern.  Also, I think it&#39;s pretty much a guarantee that toddlers will want to climb up on things and play with water and food and be up where adults are. &lt;G&gt;   <br/>\n<br/>\nI totally understand not wanting to splurge for such an expensive thing.  I don&#39;t think we would have ever gotten one if I hadn&#39;t lucked into getting it for free.  I guess that part of it is up to you.  Now that we have it, I love it.

I wondered if anyone had seen this product, or if anyone has used<br/>\nit, as I&#39;m considering purchasing it in the near future (say, next six<br/>\nmonths, possibly sooner) to have in our kitchen to help my littlest ones be<br/>\ninvolved in all that we do in there.  Hope this isn&#39;t too far off the topic<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://littlepartners.com/\">http://littlepartners.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSummary: the Learning Tower is (an expensive, IMO -- $200) product designed<br/>\nand marketed with a lot of savvy Montessori-type language --<br/>\n<br/>\n[Quote]<br/>\n<br/>\n   - Fosters a positive self-image and a sense of independence in small<br/>\n   children as they climb up and down without assistance<br/>\n   - Welcomes the child as a helping participant alongside parents and<br/>\n   siblings<br/>\n   - Nurtures a child�s innate desire to be independent and inquisitive<br/>\n<br/>\n[/Unquote]<br/>\n<br/>\nMy youngest is 13 months old -- I want to start involving her more in the<br/>\nkitchen and give her access to things she can&#39;t get to -- countertops, sink,<br/>\netc.  She LOVES climbing already, and I have to really watch her, because<br/>\neverything in her world has become a step-stool (trucks, balls, books,<br/>\nstuffed animals, boxes).  I think she&#39;d like climbing on this... I got the<br/>\nlink to the product from a Montessori site, and, although I&#39;m not any kind<br/>\nof Montessori purist, I do get a real kick out of a lot of the ideas, and I<br/>\nguess I aspire to involve the kids more.  When I saw this item, I got really<br/>\nexcited -- it seems to accommodate kids from early toddlerhood clear up to<br/>\nage 6 or so, and from reviews I&#39;ve read, it can hold two little ones at<br/>\nonce.  I&#39;m due with my second child in about a month, and I was thinking<br/>\nthis *tower* could give both my littlest ones some early independence and<br/>\naccess that they might not otherwise have.  But I am also a real sucker for<br/>\nMontessori stuff, so I have to watch myself or I&#39;d have a house full of<br/>\nwell-marketed *items* like this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am probably over-eager to have my kids be involved with me in things.  I<br/>\nlove having my daughter in the kitchen with me when I&#39;m working -- cooking,<br/>\nprepping, cleaning, whatever -- right now she stands at my legs and hangs<br/>\non, looking up and wanting to be part of it all, and she doesn&#39;t do the wrap<br/>\nor carrier thing (not that I could hold her like that right now, with my<br/>\npregnant belly).  She gets frustrated, and quickly bored with things I give<br/>\nher to do on the floor -- measuring cups, spoons, pitchers.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom an unschooling perspective:  am I jumping the gun on expecting my<br/>\nbabies to be part of activities in the kitchen?  My justification is that<br/>\nI&#39;m in the kitchen a lot -- my little girl WANTS to be with me, and<br/>\ncurrently gets frustrated by all the stuff I&#39;m doing up high that she can&#39;t<br/>\nbe a part of.  Am I trying to justify the purchase of a product that is<br/>\nunnecessary?  (would step-stools work almost as well?)  The product<br/>\nmarketing proclaims that this is better than a step-stool, because it&#39;s<br/>\nsafer, and it can also double as a little kind of jungle-gym, play-house,<br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s one more of my justifications before I turn it over to you all for<br/>\nadvice:  my 9-year-old step-son, who is along with me on the deschooling<br/>\njourney at the moment (he&#39;s been traditionally home-schooled forever, and we<br/>\nstarted deschooling about four or five months ago), also LOVES being in the<br/>\nkitchen and wants to help all the time with cooking and such.  My<br/>\n13-month-old wants to be in there with us, too, but she demands all the<br/>\nattention because she gets frustrated.  I think if I could have something<br/>\nlike this to get her involved in a project up at our level, she would be<br/>\neasier to handle, and she and her big brother could even work together --<br/>\nwhich would be fun for him AND for her, because they really love each<br/>\nother.  These days, he and I kind of wait until she&#39;s down for a nap before<br/>\nwe try to work together on a kitchen project, but then we have to be all<br/>\nquiet and everything, which is no fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis kitchen stuff has been a real de-schooling -- and scary -- area for me,<br/>\nbecause I grew up in a strict, perfect, clean house where my mother was the<br/>\nKitchen Master, and I was not allowed in, because I was messy and too eager<br/>\nand too slow and... you get the idea.  I don&#39;t want that in my house.  I am<br/>\nstill very intimidated in the kitchen, and just starting to overcome it,<br/>\nbecause my mom&#39;s voice is always whispering over my shoulder, &quot;Don&#39;t spill,<br/>\ndon&#39;t cut yourself, don&#39;t drip...&quot; etc.  I don&#39;t want to spend the next few<br/>\nyears keeping my daughter and her little brother/sister (don&#39;t know the<br/>\ngender yet) trapped behind the gate, using my mom&#39;s same pattern of keeping<br/>\nthem out because it&#39;s inconvenient or frustrating.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my expense justification:  $200 divided by two children = $100,<br/>\ndivided by 5 years of use = $20/year/child for a potentially cool item that<br/>\ncould enhance our relationships and our kitchen activities.  And if you add<br/>\nin the extra bonus of my step-son getting to interact with his little<br/>\nsiblings in the kitchen, well, that makes it even more affordable...right?<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts?  Ideas?  People who have used this or know of it?  Am I a sucker<br/>\nfor a cool-looking product?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nDeb<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":410599567,"authorName":"Stephanie Mitchell","from":"Stephanie Mitchell &lt;mumwith2kids@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Question re: &quot;The Learning Tower&quot;","postDate":"1271465060","msgId":52921,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRiY2E2NDhlLjE0MDhjMDBhLjRmNzEuNmEyNkBteC5nb29nbGUuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":52920,"nextInTopic":52922,"prevInTime":52920,"nextInTime":52922,"topicId":52919,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi...

Both my kids (3 and 6) love it in the kitchen. Since they WANT to be involved, I would still consider it ok from an unschooling perspective. My 6 yo loves to make gravy, make the lunch, and she also likes to get herbs etc that the 3 yo can&#39;t really get. My 3 yo &#39;started climbing on a chair at 12 months to help. She was in the wrap a lot while I was cooking... maybe it was a natural transition? But anyway, it just started by her picking up food scraps and eating them, or putting them in the bucket for the recycle bin. They she started getting the cups, and the spoons etc for me. She now likes to peel spuds, and carrots, and put them in the saucepan to cook. She also likes to help wash the dishes. at about 14 months, it was more playing but now sometimes she can actually &quot;wash&quot; the small items.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s grtime that your dd wants to be involved... I would just go with it and see where it leads.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, I&#39;m not a huge fan of buying toys and things to do what can be done with what I have. <br/>\nHope that helps.<br/>\nSteph</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52904,"nextTopicId":53080}}
