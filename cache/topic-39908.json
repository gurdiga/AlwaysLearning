If unschooling works when a  <br/>\nchild freely follows their interests, is unschooling also &quot;working&quot;  <br/>\nwhen a child gets good grades in a classroom?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to remove the idea from our heads that performing well at  <br/>\nclassroom learning indicates anything other than performing well at  <br/>\nclassroom learning.  It doesn&#39;t indicate that kids can take what  <br/>\nthey&#39;ve learned and apply it to the real world outside of the  <br/>\nclassroom. (Obviously educators *want* classroom learning to apply to  <br/>\nthe outside world but they&#39;re hampered by methods that must  <br/>\ndemonstrate learning is happening.)<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooled kids are learning through applying while they&#39;re already  <br/>\nin the real world. I think what good grades in a classroom for an  <br/>\nunschooler indicate is that real world knowledge sometimes transfers  <br/>\nto the artificial setting of the classroom. I wouldn&#39;t always expect  <br/>\nit to for every unschooled child, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf classroom learning is leading kids through the zoo in an orderly  <br/>\nfashion, reading all the signs, answering prepared questions and  <br/>\nunschooling learning is kids wandering the zoo as their interest  <br/>\ndraws them, sometimes reading (or being read to), observing,  <br/>\ndiscussing, what are the chances that an unschooled child would be  <br/>\nable to answer a teacher&#39;s questions?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there we get into a thinking trap. The goal of school is to  <br/>\nget as much of the group to a single destination as the teacher can.  <br/>\nThe goal of school is for all the kids to possess the same knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe goal of unschooling is for kids to grow in their own unique way.  <br/>\nThe goal isn&#39;t to absorb the same information. There will, though, be  <br/>\nsome similar information and skills just because life needs it (like  <br/>\naddition and reading signs and so on.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it&#39;s not useful to make statements about what unschoolers as a  <br/>\ngroup can do in school terms since unschooling is about the  <br/>\nindividual. *Some* unschoolers interests will have them intersecting  <br/>\nwith knowledge on a similar time line as kids in school. That doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nindicate unschooling is working, though. It just indicates the  <br/>\nchild&#39;s nonlinear path allowed him to absorb knowledge in a similar  <br/>\norder to the schooled kids. But for a child whose path went far  <br/>\nafield who has very different knowledge (and can&#39;t apply it in the  <br/>\nclassroom), it doesn&#39;t indicate anything other than their path was  <br/>\nfar afield.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Validation of unschooling","postDate":"1226104921","msgId":39950,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDMTUzNDZGLTBGOUUtNDAyOC1BM0JBLTY1QzA2NUM4MTQ5OUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDlGN0QzNURGM0YyRDQ4REU4MDk3MzEwRkZGQjA3MkQxQFJvYnluUEM+","referencesHeader":"PDk2MDk5NTEyLTQ5MTctNDAxNS1BOUZBLTkxNTFCNkM3RUU3NEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDlGN0QzNURGM0YyRDQ4REU4MDk3MzEwRkZGQjA3MkQxQFJvYnluUEM+"},"prevInTopic":39936,"nextInTopic":39960,"prevInTime":39949,"nextInTime":39951,"topicId":39908,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Let people who want to discover the actual grade follow back to your website to find the information - and then maybe end up pleasantly seduced by the rest","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-884529763\">-=-Let people who want to discover the actual grade follow back to  <br/>\nyour website<br/>\nto find the information - and then maybe end up pleasantly seduced by  <br/>\nthe<br/>\nrest of the site.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe article is to be translated into German.

Oh - and pretty much everything they  <br/>\nwere being taught in class related in some way to their big passion -  <br/>\nmusical theater - learning about the Great Depression in an economics  <br/>\nor history class? They were thinking about Annie &lt;G&gt;. That might sound  <br/>\nsilly, but that sense of place and time is valuable and is very very  <br/>\ndifficult for people to achieve when studying textbook history.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - they&#39;ve gotten good grades and two out of three have chosen to go  <br/>\nto college and I could be just bragging here for the sake of my own  <br/>\nego. I worry about it coming across that way when I talk about what my  <br/>\nnow-grown unschooled kids are doing. But, I think it is good news that  <br/>\nit is possible to step into an academic environment and excel, not in  <br/>\nspite of unschooling, but because of unschooling. I think there are a  <br/>\nzillion high school kids who are channeled into college and have no  <br/>\ngood reason to be there. As they have their whole schooled lives, they  <br/>\nare still dancing a dance that was choreographed by someone else. And  <br/>\nit shows. They don&#39;t &quot;feel&quot; it - they don&#39;t &quot;own&quot; it. Some are  <br/>\npressured to do well and they work hard - some of that is completely  <br/>\ninternalized pressure, but it is still pressure to work hard and get  <br/>\ngood grades. That is VERY different than having a desire to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Roya was in her junior year of college she said to me that she  <br/>\nwished she could get it across to her college friends that if they&#39;d  <br/>\nfocus more on learning and less on trying to get good grades that they  <br/>\nWOULD get better grades.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Validation of unschooling","postDate":"1226077547","msgId":39908,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk2MDk5NTEyLTQ5MTctNDAxNS1BOUZBLTkxNTFCNkM3RUU3NEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":39912,"prevInTime":39907,"nextInTime":39909,"topicId":39908,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This came in e-mail, and it sparked up something I ve been angsty about since yesterday, so I can make a set of them.

The first is of  <br/>\na girl who went to school voluntarily, and might come back soon, but  <br/>\nthe mom&#39;s thoughts about the first grading period:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-She has 2 A&#39;s, a B and a C (not that I care, but not bad for a kid  <br/>\nthat&#39;s never done &quot;school work&quot; before).  But I found I had to tell  <br/>\nmyself not to care.  Not because I think the grades reflect anything  <br/>\nbut because I wanted to validate that unschooling worked (yuck...that  <br/>\nwas/is a hard feeling to fight...my own ego).-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m supposed to be writing an article for a German parenting  <br/>\nnewsletter about how my kids learned higher math.  The article is  <br/>\nhalf written and it&#39;s bugging the heck out of me.  My answers won&#39;t  <br/>\nbe what they want.  I hope they don&#39;t get what they want, honestly.   <br/>\nBut I do want to finish my article.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s bothering me about it the most is that I&#39;m procrastinating and  <br/>\nstalling and feeling bad about it, while I would really like to be  <br/>\nworking on my webpages.  Those webpages do people good every day.  I  <br/>\nlike to tweak an  old page to match its  neighbors, check the links,  <br/>\nfix a typo, announce the changes at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com\">http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what I really want to do.<br/>\nBut I took a homework assignment.  And part of it leads to Kirby  <br/>\nhaving gotten the highest test grade when he took a math class, and I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to go there.  I do, but I don&#39;t.  What if he had gotten a  <br/>\nlow grade or an average grade?  But he didn&#39;t.  So...  There it swirls.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy response was<br/>\n-=-I understand this well, and I don&#39;t think you should feel guilty.   <br/>\nI&#39;ll take this quote without names to the list and you can claim it  <br/>\nor leave it anonymous, as you wish.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39636,"nextTopicId":39929}}
