I missed that, if siblings are being asked or required to change <br/>\nher diaper. That&#39;s not a good thing.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI had suggested asking one of the more compassionate older siblings to help in the event of the mom not being there.  The way it sounded to me, was that the dad wasn&#39;t being very patient or kind about the diapering and sometimes siblings are more forgiving of these kinds of things.  It didn&#39;t sound like any of the other members of the family are particularly interested in helping this kiddo, so mom should be the one doing it.  Five yr olds are still so little!<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally agree with Katherine here, until things change, the mom should be taking the child with her if it&#39;s possible.  It&#39;s so hard to be patient with diapering that extends beyond what most people consider normal!  Margaux still, at 8, won&#39;t wipe herself and she used pull-ups pretty consistently until she was a bit over 5.  The change happened almost overnight to real underwear.  Even after, she still had accidents.  All in all, what is normal IS this, not like Chamille who stopped using any diapers or having accidents at just turned 2.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKids are all so different, and just like learning everything else in the whole wide world, they&#39;ll learn things at different times and rates!  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Fri, June 25, 2010 3:00:23 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Digest Number 4149<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n-=-And the way to provide more privacy for a child to feel comfortable<br/>\nwith pottying on one&#39;s own is very UNlikely to be having her siblings<br/>\nstill diapering her, not only well after babyhood but moving out of<br/>\ntoddlerhood too.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOH.

It seems to me that having a LOT of people in<br/>\ncharge of diapering a child who is no longer exactly a toddler could<br/>\nbegin to be bothering the child.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarl has a pretty high need for privacy. Most kids have some need for<br/>\nprivacy when pottying/diapering etc. If the eventual idea is that a<br/>\nchild go in the potty anyway, obviously just saying &quot;go&quot; isn&#39;t<br/>\nnecessarily going to work. Sometimes if the need for privacy isn&#39;t<br/>\nreally acknowledged then the child may not want to put too fine a<br/>\npoint on it either even if they want more privacy. Maybe it&#39;s not been<br/>\nsomething she thinks will be acceptable? Especially if the actions of<br/>\nthe parent don&#39;t honor privacy as much as making a point of<br/>\ncontrolling undesirable pottying or diapering.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a sensitive kind of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the way to provide more privacy for a child to feel comfortable<br/>\nwith pottying on one&#39;s own is very UNlikely to be having her siblings<br/>\nstill diapering her, not only well after babyhood but moving out of<br/>\ntoddlerhood too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would consider doing all the diapering for a while and providing<br/>\ntowels/pads/whatnot in addition to diapers and wipes for the child<br/>\nwhen you&#39;re out and about.

She only wants diapers, with tabs, lying down to be changed. She is unable to diaper herself; she cannot do the tabs, ands he doesn&#39;t really want to.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are pull-ups with tabs that are super easy for changing while standing up, that look more like underwear.  Slim design and made so that when it gets wet, the design image changes color or disappears so that you know she&#39;s wet herself, or so that she knows that she&#39;s wet herself.  My youngest wore pull-ups and such for a long time too and could easily change this style herself while standing up.  If it was dirty, she could undo the tabs and take it off.  To put another one back on, she could do it like underwear, or if she was wearing pants, she could open it and put it on with the side tabs.  We also kept a LOT of wipes around.  That made a big difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are concerned with her wearing poopy diapers for too long and the possibility of infection seems likely, why not bathe her every evening before bedtime.  Lots of parents do that with infants to give their bums a break from diapers and keep it clean.  You could make it a routine, of taking clothes off, sitting on potty while running tub water, hopping in tub and running around without a diaper for a bit before dressing all up in night time clothes and heading off to bed.  If it were me, and this was my child, this is what I&#39;d do.  I know pull-ups are expensive, so I&#39;d do the diapers at night, do the whole special lying down and getting a diaper on.  I&#39;d help her the moment she got up from bed in the morning, to sit on the toilet to &quot;try&quot; and then put that diaper back on if it was still dry and if not, I&#39;d go straight to the &quot;day time&quot; pull-ups and use those for the rest of the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s old enough to tell her, &quot;we&#39;re going to try something new for a while to see how it works&quot; and then take her to the store to pick out the special day time pull-ups, or surprise her with them.  Make it fun and interesting, don&#39;t make a fuss about it, keep it light and pleasant.  If she hates the whole thing, drop it, but help her try something new that could be pleasant for everyone, including her.<br/>\n<br/>\n***While I know that I can get my mindset cleared up, I cannot force anyone else to. I have other older children and spend quite a bit of time taxiing them to their activities and events. her older sibs do not always want to change her diaper. My husband is also frustrated with the situation; and yes it&#39;s because he thinks she needs to get past it, and yes, he was coerced and forced, and ,no, he doesn&#39;t often sit back and examine how this has been damaging to him.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThen be the one who does it.  Imagine that your husband is an old guy who thinks diapering is a woman&#39;s job, and &quot;yes&quot; there are still men out there that feel that way!  Do the diapering, don&#39;t expect anyone else to do it, since you are the one who sees the problem and are trying to find a solution.  The times when you are not there to help with the diapering, enlist one of the older kids that is the most patient and considerate to help their younger sibling to use the toilet at regular intervals maybe.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t even begin to tell you how much an older sibling can help a younger sibling do something like that.  There have been many things that Margaux won&#39;t do for herself as long as mom and dad are here, but if we aren&#39;t and her sister is the only other person here, she manages just fine to do those things because of the encouragement of her older sister.  That&#39;s part of being a team member in the family.  Some team members such as older siblings can be great cheering squads, while other team members such as parents are great at DOing.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Digest Number 4149","postDate":"1277416978","msgId":55250,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5MURCM0U4LUM0RDItNDRGMC04Qjk5LUFENjE5NDE2Njg2RUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDI4OTkxQTcxRkQxNDRFOTg4OTI1MkRCRjUzM0ZDQzQ4QFN1c2FuUEM+","referencesHeader":"PDEyNzcxOTY1NzUuMTExNzEuODkyNjkubTEwQHlhaG9vZ3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPDI4OTkxQTcxRkQxNDRFOTg4OTI1MkRCRjUzM0ZDQzQ4QFN1c2FuUEM+"},"prevInTopic":55249,"nextInTopic":55251,"prevInTime":55249,"nextInTime":55251,"topicId":55248,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I will pick some quotes to respond to specifically.  On the whole, it seems probable that the biggest source of my stress over it comes from that tape in my head about no child going off to school without a diaper (meaning kindergarten- aged, in my mind).  Switching that to no child going off to college in diapers may change a lot in my perspective.  however, there are other factors, practical matters, which also seem to play into it for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchyluer wrote (and some others had similar sentiments): &quot;Why would diaper wearing increase the risk of UTI&#39;s? Really? Do the incontinent elderly have a greater risk of UTI&#39;s? Why are you worried about it?&quot;  I have heard the feces getting into the urinary tract and/ or vagina could cause some sort of infections, maybe not UTIs?  It&#39;s not so much the urine, as the diapers pull that away from the skin, though she will sometime leak out urine onto clothing and furniture; which isn&#39;t sanitary for her or the household.  <br/>\nregarding her elimination, she doesn&#39;t come tell me.  This seems more due to the inconvenience of interrupting her life than anything else.   feces gets into her vaginal area when she continues to play with that diaper on.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchulyer, you guessed I might be embarrassed about it with other adults.  Sure,  fairly rarely, I am. If that were a primary issue, it would have occurred long before now.   I would possibly  be embarrassed to have her have a dirty or leaky diaper should she be visiting a playmate, potentially stinking up their living areas of their homes horribly.  Overall, I am rather immune to what other parents think of my way of living.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchulyer again:  &quot;If your daughter prefers diapers at 5, I imagine that at 15 she will feel more intact because you respected that, even while she isn&#39;t any longer wearing diapers.&quot;  <br/>\nAbsolutely, you are right.  That&#39;s the tape I need to put into my head; thank you. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobin B wrote about me already battling over it.  I had tried establishing time without a diaper &quot; until lunch&quot; (which was often no more than an hour bc I let her keep it on for half the morning before taking it off)just a few days before I wrote.  I fortunately noticed quickly that I had set it up as a battle, rather than small steps toward a goal, and I knew that would not benefit anyone.  I also quickly realized she did not have or own that goal in any way shape or form; that I was imposing it on her. I wanted to choose otherwise before it developed further, but realized my frustration and needed to direct it away from her.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso thanks Robin for the parenting advice :&quot;Don&#39;t harsh your kid&#39;s mellow&quot; &lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra wrote:  &quot;If you tell her what she needs, how will she learn what she needs?&quot;    Yes, you are right.
