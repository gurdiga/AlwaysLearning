A friennd came by to see the baby and Soleille talked <br/>\nto her nonstop.  Paula, my friend has a daughter who&#39;s 11.  Soleille <br/>\nasked Paula if she had any babies.  Paula said, &quot;Yes, Anna&#39;s my baby.&quot; <br/>\n Soleille&#39;s eyes got very round and we could just imagine the picture in <br/>\nher head of lean, lanky 11 yr old Anna in Paula&#39;s stomach and coming <br/>\nout.  Had to do a lot of explaining with that one!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI had the egg talk with my two older dd&#39;s while I was pregnant for 4th. <br/>\n They were 6 and 4.
