Unfortunately yesterday afternoon, while<br/>\nsplitting wood, my husband Tom put his splitting axe<br/>\ninto his knee.  So I am very involved with caring for<br/>\nhim just now. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOoh Nancy, it makes me all shivery just to think of it. I hope he is well<br/>\nagain soon. Doing physical therapy (or even just wading back and forth) in a<br/>\npool is really good for knees - once the cut is healed of course. James is a<br/>\nveteran of two knee surgeries including a total knee replacement.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I have never challenged anyone online or elsewhere<br/>\nabout whether they were really unschoolers.  The<br/>\noriginal question I posed was in response to the<br/>\n&quot;bitching&quot; I have heard recently in various groups<br/>\nabout people who know &quot;unschoolers&quot; and who find them<br/>\npushy, sanctimonious, rude, etc.  So I was just<br/>\nwondering what others had experienced regarding this<br/>\nseeming cross section of controlling and self<br/>\nrighteous &quot;unschoolers&quot; that these folks seem to be<br/>\nrunning into. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only h/s parents I have met IRL that I don&#39;t like much, or don&#39;t connect<br/>\nwith emotionally, aren&#39;t Unschoolers - even pretend unschoolers. All the<br/>\ngenuine Unschoolers I have met IRL are wonderful people - generous of heart,<br/>\nopen, humorous, enthusiastic about life - and usually really wise. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe people that tend to seem most sanctimonious to me are the ones (few) who<br/>\nhave &quot;tried unschooling and it didn&#39;t work&quot;, so they returned to directing<br/>\ntheir children&#39;s education and imposing their educational goals. When they<br/>\nelaborate on their experiences it is clear that they tried it in the way<br/>\nSandra has written about in her essay - they were expecting a two week<br/>\n&quot;hands off&quot; to result in a spontaneous generation of a six subject daily<br/>\nwork schedule or school-commensurate skills acquisition. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne person I know poo-poos unschooling every time she can, because<br/>\nessentially she became too impatient with her son&#39;s (then 5.5) progress<br/>\ntowards penmanship with an &quot;unschooling approach&quot;. I gather that entailed<br/>\nher standing over his shoulder while he tried to write the assigned words<br/>\nbeing increasingly horrified at how he was forming his letters. She said he<br/>\nwas worried about it, but personally I think he just felt judged. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe bought a How to Write book that she now recommends - it&#39;s difference<br/>\nseems to be that it is more centered on starting with easy letters rather<br/>\nthan following the alphabet. Jayn writes words and letters because she<br/>\nenjoys doing so, choosing them for their importance to her message or<br/>\nmeaning. But it&#39;s easy for me to be sanguine on the matter - she has been<br/>\nholding her implement the &quot;proper&quot; way since the first time she picked up a<br/>\nspoon in infancy.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
