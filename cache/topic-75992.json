Stimming is a word to describe repetitive behaviours which children and adults use to help","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-824143118\">Stimming in my experience is not usually used to shame children. Stimming is a word to describe repetitive behaviours which children and adults use to help modulate their emotions - particularly to calm themselves or to keep themselves alert. It is used by many people with disabilities in a positive way about themselves. We all use stimming behaviours - hair twiddling, or pencil tapping are examples. <br/>\n<br/>\nAn intense and repetitive stimming behaviour going on for long periods  could indicate that a child is overwhelmed by their emotion and is finding a situation stressful, but doesn&#39;t have the capability right now to get out of the situation for themselves nor to calm themselves down effectively. I would therefore look carefully at what she is doing when she uses intense stimming - particularly if she doesn&#39;t seem happy. If you focus on  keeping the Ipad charged and enabling her to continue, you could be keeping her in a stressful situation which she can&#39;t yet make her own way out of. She is very young and may not be able to tell you how she feels about it - can you tell if she is happy or anxious when she behaves like that? And does the behaviour seem to reduce her anxiety (if she is anxious) or does she seem stuck? <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom your post you said you removed those apps - was that because you felt she was not enjoying them and they caused her more anxiety than joy? If it is joy, of course help her to continue, but if it is anxiety and stress you might want to look a bit more deeply into what she is playing those apps for, and whether there are other apps she could play which she will enjoy as much but will not find as stressful right now.  There is no problem with using stimming behaviours,<br/>\nbut if they indicate extreme anxiety or stress I would not ignore that communication, nor would I act to keep her in that situation. She might be showing you that this is very stressful for her and she needs your help to move on. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be worth looking into other ways she could calm herself and you could help her calm herself -  chewable jewellery, body brushing, stroking her, deep body pressure, water play or a nest swing might be possibilities.  And you could try copying her stimming with her, alongside her, and see what it feels like, which might give you more insight into what she is gaining from it and what need she might be fulfilling. <br/>\n<br/>\nNaomi</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":471808634,"authorName":"Nowhere Man","from":"Nowhere Man &lt;yoyall1@...&gt;","profile":"yoyall1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Not knowing what normal looks like","postDate":"1434639086","msgId":76012,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJMVTQzNi1TTVRQODE4Q0U0QzZGRjAyNjVGQkIyODFGMUYwQTUwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PENBUG1rdEItPTh2RFNOQUNBcVR0RC1QSEVQX0xNLWNqTFhWQ0xDd0hoc0Q3amF0alBCQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDg1Q0I3RjkxLTMwNjctNDJDQi1BRDM1LTM3RjQ2NDkyMDhFMkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPENBSl82TUhyVjVIWlB1RjZBSGQxPW5LdGlwdlJuSlU1T0M9K2VXVG0xUl9GQjc1RXRmUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPEEzMzIxMTUwLUZFRTktNDEzRC04QjZGLTY4OTREQzhBNDQ5RUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPENBUG1rdEItPTh2RFNOQUNBcVR0RC1QSEVQX0xNLWNqTFhWQ0xDd0hoc0Q3amF0alBCQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":76007,"nextInTopic":76020,"prevInTime":76011,"nextInTime":76013,"topicId":75992,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My daughter does play-pause-play, and play-rewind-play, especially with music, but also movies.

Instead of taking apps away, find more that will help her to do this. Make sure the ipad has plenty of battery - charge it overnight. Buy a second one so she can use that while the first is charging. Find her a beanbag to sit on by the socket so she can still play while it&#39;s charging. Show her how to plug it in, what sound it makes when it needs plugging in so her game doesn&#39;t get cut off without warning. Help her to do the things she wants or needs to do as much as she possibly can.<br><br>&quot;</span><span style=\"font-size:12.8000001907349px;\">I believe she&#39;s doing it because she&#39;s lacking and in need of something.&quot;<br><br>So don&#39;t make that lack even worse by taking things away. <br><br>I would suggest that you focus on your relationship and connection with her. Watch or play these apps with her. If she starts to press play and pause repeatedly, maybe ask her, kindly and with genuine interest, why she&#39;s doing it. Say it makes it difficult to play if she does that...but if that&#39;s the way she wants to play, that&#39;s cool anyway. Ask her if there&#39;s something bothering her. Does she need a snack? Does she need to move her body? Would she like you to get a swing for the garden or a spinny chair or an indoor trampoline? Does she need to be cuddled up tight? Does she need a drink? Is she bored? (Incidentally, one of my children sometimes does that play-pause-play thing...I asked her why she does, once, and she said it&#39;s when it&#39;s late at night and she&#39;s bored but not tired - we suggested a big, physical play time before other family members need to go to bed and that really helped her.
