Michelle stayed in the car. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my grandmother got cancer, I stayed with her a few months, and it <br/>\nwas great getting to know her more closely.  I had stayed with her a <br/>\nwhile when I was 16 as well.   I also got to know my Grandpa Hoyle, who <br/>\nmy grandmother married after 8 years widowhood, and they had their 25th <br/>\nanniversary while I was staying with her that 2nd time when she was <br/>\nsick.  Getting to know them was a great thing for me, and Grandpa isn&#39;t <br/>\na blood relation but I would love it if he were.  He&#39;s been in a <br/>\nnursing home for several years (needing round the clock care 24/7).  <br/>\nNow he&#39;s 96 and my grandmother has been gone for 24 years.  I haven&#39;t <br/>\nbeen to see him but I ask after him a lot.  I don&#39;t want to go visit.  <br/>\nI saw him in person I think it was 2001 while he was still living on <br/>\nhis on.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike Michelle, I didn&#39;t want to remember Grandma dead in a casket or go <br/>\nto her funeral, so my parents didn&#39;t make it a thing about it at all.  <br/>\nI would say that had a lot to do with the fact that my dad found his <br/>\ndad dead of a heart attack in the field.  He was a chicken and egg <br/>\nfarmer in the 40s.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents weren&#39;t unschoolers.  So how how all this relates is that <br/>\nunschoolers can respect the children choices in such important matters <br/>\non purpose.
