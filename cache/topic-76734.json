Some of you will be interested because you know me.  Some might just be curious to hear my voice and some stories about things that aren’t about my kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe competitive part is that this is a newish podcast.  This is episode 8.   I would like to be on there another time or two, and if a lot of people listen, I’ll be more likely to be invited again. <br/>\n<br/>\nALSO… more practical for here, hearing my voice might help with the reading of posts from me here.  Seriously.  I write as I speak.<br/>\n<br/>\nI’m partly sorry for bringing a link that’s not about unschooling, but partly it might spark some memories and story telling and connections, and that’s all about learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome topics, in stories from the 1960’s:  David Bowie, Simon & Garfunkel, Donovan, and lots of side stories<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if you turn it on and don’t listen, it will up the count.  I think you might like it enough to listen, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.blogspot.com/2016/02/city-on-edge-podcast.html\">http://sandradodd.blogspot.com/2016/02/city-on-edge-podcast.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76719,"nextTopicId":76725}}
