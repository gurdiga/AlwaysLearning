It means making the trip to the game store the day the anxiously awaited new game title comes out. It means abandoning a shopping trip if they&#39;ve reached their limit. It means reading the Berenstein Bears for the 50th time.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Note for those with boundary issues who often misread pushing out of our comfort zone as pushing beyond our limits: Be reasonable about what can be accomplished in a day. Build meeting your own needs into the day.]<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it doesn&#39;t mean letting them hurt or endanger other people just because they want to do something. It doesn&#39;t mean letting them kick you. Or spit on people. Or putting you or the rest of your family in danger of legal trouble. Help them live in the world while considering other people.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But this car is in my name, and I am choosing not to be held legally responsible for your illegal choices.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d express it simpler: not as what you won&#39;t do but as a reality, as an obstacle in the path. &quot;If you&#39;re arrested for possession or driving under the influence in my car I can be held responsible.&quot; ***<br/>\n<br/>\n[If the parental responsibility is true in your state. In MA parents are only held responsible if they &quot;should have known.&quot; Like going away for the weekend leaving unsupervised teens at home, it&#39;s assumed the parents should know it&#39;s likely there will be a party with alcohol. In this case, since he has a pattern of smoking with friends after work, it would be easy for a lawyer to make the point the mother should have known he&#39;d do it again if she gave him the car again.]<br/>\n<br/>\n[*** While both statements are true, I&#39;m failing at coming up with a succinct explanation of why the second is better for problem solving. The first comes across like drawing a line on how much you&#39;re willing to help. The second is a problem with potential solutions. It allows the *other person* to conclude that it&#39;s not reasonable to cause someone to get into legal trouble, but also opens doors to ways around it like buying the car.]<br/>\n<br/>\n[NOTE: See the principle as providing information to help with decision making rather than explaining why they shouldn&#39;t do something.]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You&#39;ll need to get your own car.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d leave that off. I find it irritating to be told what I need to do to solve a problem. Open lots of doors. Offer to drive. Offer to help him look for his own car. Offer to let him buy that one or transfer it to his name if it&#39;s essentially his.  Find options.

It muddies the discussion to call homeschooling method and the relationship between parents and kids unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Less / More whatever. How (why) prejudge that? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sandra will at times make judgements before a discussion gets going in order to keep the list focused in the way she wants it focused. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not judging. I&#39;m not squashing the discussion. It&#39;s not my list. I&#39;m just explaining why this topic is borderline for this list Sandra brought up doubts about the fit.<br/>\n<br/>\nEverything connects to everything. Which means everything connects to unschooling. :-) But to prevent the list from being about everything, Sandra will decide where she wants the line drawn. Not everyone will agree with that line. Which is why it&#39;s useful for people to shop around lists to find a line they like (that may be looser or tighter than is drawn here.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; These legal and ethical consequences are significant and *may* need to override the desire to stick to a pure theory.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That would be a big part of discussing ways to meet his needs safely. I&#39;m not sure what &quot;pure theory&quot; would be in relation to radical unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe the driving after smoking is him coming home from a friend&#39;s house. So taking the keys away is after the fact. That will be a judgement call for the mom on whether he&#39;s a danger enough to take the car away. In fact it might be quite useful for them to research together and talk about. Especially useful since I doubt there&#39;s a clear cut answer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She&#39;s concerned that his use may be more than just recreational or exploration.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It wasn&#39;t clear from her initial post that she was worried about the extent. It sounded like she was just worried that he was smoking at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; when not stoned. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think the discussion hasn&#39;t been highly focused on the dangers because the original poster never said &quot;stoned.&quot; She did say high once but twice said smoked. So the post felt more about the mom&#39;s fears of pot than about someone who is using to the point of impairment.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrying to figure out what she meant at this point isn&#39;t important, but the words people choose, the flavor those words give, influences how people respond to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; To stifle this conversation has the potential to continue to send that message to young unschooling parents.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;ve jumped to the conclusion that the &quot;not about unschooling&quot; is because it&#39;s about drugs. Anyone who has been on the list for a while has seen discussions about drugs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe relationship sounded more conventional with the mom wanting to convince her son to stop smoking pot. It may have read differently to you but it seemed most people were reading it that way based on the responses.

I thought you initially expressed the same by prefacing the original post with your statements. <br/>\n<br/>\nI in no way wanted or want a &quot;debate&quot;. I expressed my appreciation and gratefullness to you for bringing this topic forward. I&#39;m sorry if that wasn&#39;t clear or if you suspected ulterior motives. If expressing my opinion on the topic appeared to be provocative, then I&#39;m sorry. <br/>\nMy expression of my opinion on this topic was a &quot;gift&quot; offered with sincerity and generosity. If anyone finds that my gift was an ugly sweater that doesn&#39;t fit, then throw it away, I&#39;m not hurt or offended. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy only hope is that this mother and others who are dealing with these tough issues &quot;hear&quot; that I am truly supportive and empathetic and willing to think things thru as a suggester or a sounding board. I&#39;d hoped there were others here feeling the same way. I was not comfortable with the initial level of condemnation and blame to this mother when she&#39;s obviously a caring parent. Sitting by without offering another view feels yucky to me. She&#39;s not asking for all the reasons that she&#39;s &quot;failed&quot; or fallen short. She&#39;s asking for advice and suggestions that she can try or implement right now, not yesterday. She brought it here because she sees this group as most relevant to her principles and I know it took a lot of courage to strip bare in front of her most valued peers. I admire her for this. I wish I&#39;d have seen more of this in my early unschooling years. It would&#39;ve meant the world to me. And might have prevented or arrested feelings of isolation and the irrational thoughts or behaviors that can grow in isolation. Many unschoolers do not have an in-person support system or &quot;friendship&quot;. It was a complement to the people of this group that this mother brought her issue here.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra, I know its your party. If you think that these &quot;grown&quot; unschooling issues don&#39;t belong here, then I&#39;ll take it elsewhere, just say the word. But, I don&#39;t think it will be &quot;a yahoo group to argue for fun&quot;. I think joiners would be serious about exploring family life as grown kids move towards independence. <br/>\n<br/>\nEither way, please pass on my contact information to this mom if she wants. I would like to offer continued support, encouragement, or whatever I can to help her navigate this issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith great sincerity and highest regard,<br/>\nCheryl </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: 21 year old son living at home...

It will only stop him from driving *that* car.  He could get another car, he could drive a friend’s car.  If you take the car then it’s punishment for not doing things your way or it’s protecting your investment (the car) or it’s an attempt to limit your legal responsibility if he’s busted.    You can do that, I guess, but don’t deceive yourself that you’re doing it to protect or change him.  You’d be doing it for you. <br/>\n<br/>\nI’m just guessing but maybe the one percent of the time he seems depressed it’s because you’re talking too much about him smoking pot.  I don’t think you can use his mental health as an argument for him to quit.  I think he’s probably fine. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf this is about pot smoking then, if you can, help him move out, sign the car over to him and get off his back.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf it’s about his well being then cultivate the kind of relationship that will let you help him stay safe.  Stop hounding him.  Coach him about keeping his pipe out of sight, offer to pick him up if he’s been smoking.   <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can’t control him, you can’t stop him, you can make things at home better or worse and making them worse for him won’t be any kind of motivation for him to be more careful or considerate of you. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: 21 year old son living at home...

Someone who can become giddy with excitement will have a corresponding low. Someone who has no idea what a suicidal feeling is like probably has also never had joy so big it hurt to breathe.

Whatever it is you&#39;re talking about doesn&#39;t sound like a problem to him. He&#39;s just making appeasing noises to shut you up. Which sounds like it&#39;s more of a problem for you than it is for him. ====<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I&#39;m wrong, but from my point of view, the problem is not that he is smoking pot, but that he is doing it stupidly.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving drug paraphernalia in his car, where if Mom could find it, so could the police on a traffic stop, is stupid. <br/>\n<br/>\nDriving while loaded is stupid. It is even more stupid when the driver is young.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the taking keys might be part of the &quot;friends don&#39;t let friends drive....&quot; idea, but removing them after the fact is pointless and becomes punishment. All it will do is foster resentment, and remind him that his Mom believes that he is too immature to be trusted. Is Mom afraid that her son will decide he doesn&#39;t want to hear a lecture when he has just gotten home stoned, and go out again?<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople often make stupid choices when they feel backed into a corner.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know whether using pot is a symptom of depression, or a reaction to it, or completely unconnected. I don&#39;t know whether this particular person is depressed or has a problem with addiction. But if he does (or even if he doesn&#39;t but just wants to), he will find a way to get high regardless of anything or anyone. If he really is an addict, if he really is depressed, forcing him into the shadows with punishments will not help.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Mom is asking him if he feels depressed on the morning after, he might agree. But feeling a bit anxious and shaky the morning after a..er...night out, is kinda what can happen normally. I say give him a nice healthy breakfast with plenty of protein and juice, then ask him how he feels.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think jumping to the worst case scenario with labels and diagnoses FIRST before considering other reasons for any behavior is detrimental to unschooling and clear logical thinking. It doesn&#39;t mean those worst cases don&#39;t exist, but logically they are not the most likely situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m getting that he is going directly from work to his socializing, so offering him some money for a cab may not work, but it might. He might feel better going out unencumbered by his car, but also feels like he won&#39;t be &quot;allowed&quot; to go out, at least not without a lecture, if he drops his car off at home first. Obviously having the car with him is not working as the deterrent I suspect his Mom may have hoped it would.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe everyone will be happier if he moved out to an apartment close to his job and his friends, and could smoke at home in relative safety. Please note I am NOT suggesting that the Mom host this in her house. <br/>\n<br/>\n(But as a thought exercise, what if he were free to smoke at home?)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor some people, pot&#39;s like a weekend relaxation treat. For others, it appears to sap the motivation to do anything other than sit around getting high, and life can get sordid. I suspect the latter is what the Mom fears. But I also suspect that is the much less common situation, more of a media fueled stereotype, that what really happens most of the time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEither it&#39;s his car or it&#39;s not. If he is the only person using the car, sign it over to him, unless maybe that makes the insurance too expensive. Wouldn&#39;t that be a vote of confidence? Maybe it would make him more responsible with it, since he would have the true sense of ownership. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Its just my opinion that these are unschooling issues and that unschooling does not stop at at chronological age of 18. (If you want to debate this issue, I think it has a place here too.) I appreciate Sandra&#39;s choice to bring it to this list even though she seems to have apprehension. <br/>\n<br/>\nIts hard for unschooling parents to loose their community because their kid is over 18. Sandra surely hasn&#39;t stopped discussing her children and their relationships just because they are all over 18. Maybe someone will be inspired to start a group for grown unschooling families. Our lifestyle is not relatable to the mainstream so there&#39;s very little support or resources to support an on-going unschooling relationship beyond &quot;school&quot; years. <br/>\nEitherway, this case seems to lean more towards unschooling and less towards mature independent adult relationships, making it a valuable discussion on this list.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;It&#39;s not that some good stuff can&#39;t come from the discussion. It&#39;s that increasingly less good stuff *for a list focused on unschooling ideas* can come from discussing problems the further removed they are from kids who are of compulsory school age.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote> Less / More whatever. How (why) prejudge that? Why not let it evolve and see what the group thinks. It seems that many have already related it to their own experiences. It may be &quot;less good stuff&quot; for you but it seems to be good enough stuff for others. And more importantly it is *more* good stuff for a mom in crisis who turned to this list. Dont turn her away because that would definately lead to &quot;less good stuff&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; But, call it what you will, it would be tragic if you let him and he killed or injured himself or others.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The problem, though, is that control tends to shut down communication. And it causes people to sneak and lie if what&#39;s being controlled is important enough to them. If control worked, alcoholism wouldn&#39;t be a problem. Control won&#39;t keep someone from making dangerous choices.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Of course. And I didn&#39;t suggest control. I suggested lots of open communication and offering him resources. Control=bad. Okay.<br/>\nThere were lots of relationship - communication suggestions but no one pointed out the legal and ethical consequences of driving while under the influence of pot. <br/>\nThese legal and ethical consequences are significant and *may* need to override the desire to stick to a pure theory.<br/>\nWe strive for healthy noncoercive open supportive relationships but when someone is going to immediately drive under the influence, taking the keys away in the moment is the responsible and loving action. Work on unschooling relationship in the morning or later when the kid is not stoned. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Whether he&#39;s smoking for social reasons, to unwind, to escape, as an act of defiance towards control, it&#39;s a response to a situation in his life. Control doesn&#39;t make the situation go away. Control just cuts off something he found soothed the situation.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If his mom can talk less about her fears of pot and listen more about his thoughts on his feelings and what the pot does for him she can be more helpful. And discuss other options and ways he can do this safely, she&#39;ll be helping him open doors rather than trying to get him to shut the one door.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t suggest taking his pot away. I suggested taking the keys to the car. And furthermore, a car that she has legal responsibility for.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis mom should talk about her fears until she can identify the source of the fears and evaluate their truth vs myth. Expressing her fears to her son offers him the opportunity to be a partner in the resolution. It might be helpful for them to work thru irrational ideas or fear together. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother reason why this discussion is helpful/useful here is that it brings to light that these issues might be better explored before age 21. These values/priciples should be discussed from an early age. If it has, this mom can appeal to the son&#39;s ultimate desire to maintain principles he had adopted/accepted when not stoned. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; True but there is a balance and a continuum from &quot;childhood&quot; to &quot;adulthood&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Its obvious that this kid is not behaving like an adult and his judgement does <br/>\n&gt; &gt; not appear to be good right now. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And imposing mom&#39;s right thinking isn&#39;t likely to make judgement better whether someone&#39;s 6 or 21. Helping them think about situations from different angles, think about other options and think through consequences and ways to avoid them, that will help make more thoughtful decisions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, yes, absolutely. <br/>\nAgain, thats why this situation offers an excellent example to unschooling parents. Many are going to deal with this same situation with kids under 18. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m an advocate for legalizing marijuana. I don&#39;t think forbidding it would be helpful at all. I think this mom has a wonderful opportunity to help guide her kid/adult to rational healthy choices. She&#39;s concerned that his use may be more than just recreational or exploration. It should be pointed out that some people do get &quot;addicted&quot; to pot so it shouldn&#39;t be dismissed out of hand. She&#39;s also concerned that he&#39;s using to self-medicate and may have some level of disfunctional thinking (ie depression). This is common too and should be further explored. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood unschooling families deal with these type of issues. A heathy unschooling relationship does not always prevent drug use/abuse or other negative life choices. Too many caring unschooling parents are hesitant to bring up these type issue because they fear judgement by their peers (other unschoolers) and they fear they are the only good unschooling family dealing with this and no one will be able to relate. To stifle this conversation has the potential to continue to send that message to young unschooling parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nI encourage her to continue seeking assistance, advice, guidance, etc. I admire her dedication to a kid who&#39;s beyond 18.   <br/>\nAgain, I thank Sandra for bring this issue to this list.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":301108410,"authorName":"Marina DeLuca-Howard","from":"Marina DeLuca-Howard &lt;delucahoward@...&gt;","profile":"matedgirl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] 21 year old son living at home...

How can one be torn up over a kid being<br/>\noverall good?  In context of his life it sounds like this kid has a lot of<br/>\nrules--be home early, and only use the car for work. Go to the doctor if<br/>\nmom thinks you are sick.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if he smokes or drinks or smokes pot with friends he needs to hurry<br/>\nhome.  Hurrying home sounds like the issue here.  If  the kid is depressed<br/>\nmaybe its having his behaviour pathologised or his mom&#39;s rules that make<br/>\nhim doubt himself or maybe he can&#39;t please his mother? Its hard to think<br/>\nfor yourself and make choices under conditions of trust for some people,<br/>\nbut knowing that your mother will search out evidence to prove you are<br/>\n&quot;rule breaking&quot; without thinking that her principles and rules may not<br/>\nmesh.  Absolutes don&#39;t work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that in Sandra&#39;s children&#39;s stories there is trust and work and<br/>\nthought which helps further understanding.

My husband smiled and<br/>\nasked our son if he had tried it--my son replied in the same tone and said<br/>\nhe didn&#39;t see the point of being giddy and didn&#39;t find the idea of inhaling<br/>\nsmoke appealing. He also asks my husband on occasion why he smokes<br/>\ncigerettes--genuinely curious.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son admitted to being fascinated by his peers usage and subsequent silly<br/>\nbehaviour.  He is also confused why his dad smokes cigerettes.  John has<br/>\nquit cigerettes repeatedly over the years, but always re-started.  Not that<br/>\nRowan is a serious kid or judgemental--he has a witty sense of humour but<br/>\nis extremely logical and curious.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband was surprized.  He told me later as a teen he would have gone<br/>\nalong with his friends without question and it wouldn&#39;t have been a topic<br/>\nof family conversation. All John&#39;s friend&#39;s kids drink alcholol and smoke<br/>\npot and occasionally one gets caught shoplifting. One of John&#39;s friends<br/>\nsaid we should expect our kids to do these things because everyone does it<br/>\nand if we don&#39;t know our son is doing it we are obviously &quot;stupid&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo John&#39;s friends who were the &quot;controlling types&quot; Rowan was spoiled at age<br/>\ntwo, smothered at age six for still nursing, rescued from natural<br/>\nconsequences, given too much freedom, and talked to as if he were as<br/>\n&quot;adult&quot; and his ideas were equally important to me at too young an age.<br/>\nObvously, we are in for the &quot;consequences&quot; of my &quot;bad&quot; parenting choices.<br/>\nNow we are being &quot;stupid&quot; because we believe our son doesn&#39;t smoke pot,<br/>\ndrink or shoplift and we support his playing &quot;too&quot; many video games and buy<br/>\nthem for him.  The question of why our son would lie is one that in their<br/>\nworld can&#39;t be asked.  Kids always lie to parents--they lied and their kids<br/>\nlie. One guy said obviously our son has problems: our son is immersed in<br/>\nrole playing games with his on line friends and that&#39;s like drugs and<br/>\nshoplifing.  Are we going to help him shoplift and shoot heroine?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you judge your kids behaviour on those sorts of spectrums how can they<br/>\npossibly trust you? Also the nature of the activity--cutting, reckless<br/>\ndriving, suicide attempts all seems so different to drinking socially,<br/>\npotsmoking with friends, and other social activities that seem to have<br/>\nblurry lines.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy, Rowan wonders, if the point of  parenting is helping the child to<br/>\nlearn to identify what he needs, how to have fun, to learn to be with other<br/>\npeople, learn how to be safe and to make choices would I be surprized that<br/>\nhe can do these things?<br/>\n<br/>\n As a partner and friend to my child I always let him know he was loved,<br/>\nthat there were choices I wanted for him, the reasons for those choices<br/>\netc...But if he made his own choices and if it didn&#39;t work out I always<br/>\nwanted to help and to talk and let him figure out things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure what the future holds. We said if he did try anything in<br/>\nfuture and felt scared/worried or was in trouble to please let us know and<br/>\nwe would help.  He replied that putting himself in a situation where he<br/>\nwasn&#39;t in control wasn&#39;t appealing.  I don&#39;t always agree with his choices<br/>\nbut he always listens to my reasons.  Now, he doesn&#39;t always agree with his<br/>\nfriends choices, nor his parent&#39;s choices, but he has learned to think for<br/>\nhimself and make his own choices without making others feel bad about their<br/>\nchoices.  The choices are getting more &quot;serious&quot; and our ability to control<br/>\nhim less--so Rowan tells us he feels good about his ability to make choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know a woman who unschooled who said her daughter tried pot socially.

And discuss other options and ways he can do this safely, she&#39;ll be helping him open doors rather than trying to get him to shut the one door.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; True but there is a balance and a continuum from &quot;childhood&quot; to &quot;adulthood&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; Its obvious that this kid is not behaving like an adult and his judgement does <br/>\n&gt; not appear to be good right now. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And imposing mom&#39;s right thinking isn&#39;t likely to make judgement better whether someone&#39;s 6 or 21. Helping them think about situations from different angles, think about other options and think through consequences and ways to avoid them, that will help make more thoughtful decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalking *to* him, *repeatedly* talking to him, taking the keys away, setting curfews none of those give people better tools and they tear at relationships. If this is how their relationship has been for 21 years, it&#39;s not a dynamic that helps someone become thoughtful about their choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile parents will justify such responses in order to control kids until they learn how to make the &quot;right&quot;, e.g., the parents&#39;, decisions, it doesn&#39;t work as well as people wish it would! Kids can learn to act a certain way around parents to shut them up and then act entirely differently when parents aren&#39;t around. Kids can come to believe they aren&#39;t competent enough to make good decisions. Kids grow and see the world differently so that choices that seemed nonsensical at 6 can make sense at 12, but it&#39;s age that changed them not the control.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile that controlling behavior is labeled &quot;treating him like a child&quot;, even children don&#39;t like or respond well to it. At 21 he legally gets to say &quot;No more.

On-going dialogue with this kid is desirable and many parents find agreements with more or less marijuana use.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-He has always been such a joy but he smokes pot. I&#39;ve talked to him about it several times. Sometimes he says he thinks he needs help but doesn&#39;t know how to get it. I&#39;ve sent him to an M.D. for depression, he says he feels depressed, he didn&#39;t want to take the medication to help him. Which is fine, I understand that. He doesn&#39;t want to go to counseling.-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am socially and geographically in a place where smoking pot isn&#39;t such a big deal.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Medication from an MD for depression isn&#39;t going to do ANYthing without counselling to change thought and behavior, so I think that was a bad move (sending someone to a regular doctor for depression).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is *not* true. Medication from an MD *can* be helpful even without counselling. (though coercion to accept mediation is not desirable). I think you absolutely did the correct thing to take your child to the regular doctor 1st and get referal if needed to other resourses. If a person says they feel depressed you would be negligent not to have it evaluated by others(I&#39;m not advocating any particular profession). I&#39;m assuming that your son was in cooperation with this dr visit as he is 21 and could refuse to go. So, I would take that to mean he is also concerned and your offering, arranging, and taking him shows him that you are paying attention and take his concerns seriously and that you are someone he can trust and depend on. <br/>\nMedication can be helpful even if counseling is refused, because sometimes one might need to feel a little better before getting to the point of accepting counseling. Of course I know medication has its dangers but being prejudicial or close-minded to medication is irrational. I would rather make an informed decision than rejecting it outright. <br/>\n<br/>\nProvide as many options and resources as you can. There&#39;s no single answer for every person.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; But if this is true, he&#39;s not depressed anyway:  &quot;99 percent of the time he seems really happy, loves his new job. &quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not necessarily true either. Depression is not always situational and often is hormonal or chemical or organic. A person could appear &quot;really happy&quot; for 99% of their day, week, month, whatever and still have lows that are extremely low and potential dangerous.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m wondering if your &quot;I&#39;ve talked to him about it several times&quot; involved suggesting to him that he wouldn&#39;t smoke pot if he wasn&#39;t depressed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be a good question to ask if he feels motivated to smoke when feeling &#39;depressed&#39;. Helping him identify when and why he is smoking would be good, of course it has to be appreciated or desired by the other party. Did you mean to say &quot;I&#39;ve talked *with* him...&quot;? As long as he&#39;s open to conversation about the subject it can be an opportunity for both of you to explore the pros and cons and other options. I would guess that you have as little or less information than he has. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would, if it were me, stop treating him like a child.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nI heard nothing that indicates this parent is treating him like a child. I would be just as concerned about my spouse if they were behaving the way he is and it wouldn&#39;t be &quot;(s)mothering&quot; if I were to question his motives, behavior, options, and resources and offer assistance. And, if my husband was driving under the influence, I would take great measures to prevent it if he was not cooperative.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; When the term &quot;permit&quot; was used, I&#39;m assuming that meant driver&#39;s license.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-I&#39;ve taken his car away several times because I know that he has been high while driving it. <br/>\n&gt; -=-Well, he came home today and it was obvious he has smoked earlier, I looked in his car and sure enough he had a pipe. I took his keys. Everything in my gut tells me not to let him have his car back. It&#39;s still in our name but he does have insc. in his name. -=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve asked the original author not to participate in this exchange, so I&#39;m not asking for clarification, but I&#39;m pointing out some confusion.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I understand a car kind of belonging to someone, and kind of not.  Marty&#39;s jeep is in his name and mine, so we could buy it all in one day and get a loan from the credit union.  And he hasn&#39;t fully paid for it.  Still, I wouldn&#39;t take his keys away from him or take his car away.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are legal issues involved here. Even if the driver is insured, the owner of the car can be (and will be) named in a lawsuit if there are damages or injuries. <br/>\nIf you *own* the car you have a legal responsibility to not allow it to be driven by someone under the influence. The law/court does not care that you only put it in your name and he is &quot;really&quot; the owner.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; His girlfriend is older than he is.  She bought a car on her own, entirely, while living away from home.  She moved back home at some point, and because she came in late one night, her dad took the keys away from her and wouldn&#39;t let her drive her own car.  It never WAS his; he didn&#39;t help her buy it.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile wrong & atrocious, this is not on level with restricting someones driving *while under the influence*. He&#39;s shown that he will or has driven while being compromised and I don&#39;t think that taking his keys is the same as punishment. But, call it what you will, it would be tragic if you let him and he killed or injured himself or others.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Parents can go too far.  If you allow a 21 year old to live at home (I have two kids at home at 20 and 23, and my other one moved out just as he turned 21), you can&#39;t really continue to treat them as children.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nTrue but there is a balance and a continuum from &quot;childhood&quot; to &quot;adulthood&quot;. Its obvious that this kid is not behaving like an adult and his judgement does not appear to be good right now. <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I see no advantage whatsoever in even considering doing something that would keep him (or any child, or any housemate) from getting to work.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=- I&#39;ve tried telling him that he could use the car for work but then to bring home right after, well, that never works, he will come late at night. I really don&#39;t know what to do. Overall he is a really good kid, I&#39;m so torn up about this.-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think being torn up about it is an appropriate or useful response.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t tell a 21 year old to come home right after work.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It seems like too much control to me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, this kind of &quot;controlling behavior&quot; might backfire but it might make an impression and maybe it will be short-lived and convey our outrage at dui. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you remove the car, you should probably offer to drive him or obtain transport by bus, cab, or friend (not the smoking ones). If he quits his job due to not being able to drive a car, that is not your responsibility, it is his. Millions of people work without a car.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure that overall your assessment that he&#39;s a good kid is accurate. Making a mistake in judgement or having an addition problem does not negate his good qualities. <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s three years past compulsory education age in any state, too, so it&#39;s not really an unschooling question.  I don&#39;t mind discussing it.  And I&#39;m not sure where a better place to discuss it would be, but I&#39;m a little uncomfortable with it. &lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it *is* appropriate here and I really appreciate your consideration. I think it could be very helpful to many families. Especially to this mother who seems to share unschooling values & experiences and is reaching out for help. As long as a parent is still parenting, then does it really matter how many years he is past compulsory education age. As unschoolers, we know that chronological age and grades are irrelevant. This kid is still living at home, behaves as a teenager, and the mother is behaving in the mother role. Some kids need this longer than others.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; It doesn&#39;t sound like a solid, respectful relationship.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But more controls, shaming, threats, rules, curfews, punishments.... I don&#39;t see how those can be part of any good unschooling-family discussion.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nIt does not sound like a solid respectful relationship but this could be due to drug abuse or compromised thought process. Respectful relationships as adults are a two-way street. This mother obviously is searching for a respectful relationship. This man/child is not being respectful and that should be expected for anyone living in someones house.<br/>\n<br/>\nShaming, threats, controls, are not desirable. However, sometimes people are irrationally behaving in ways that are harmful or potentially dangerous and need swift intervention. Relationship repair might have to wait a bit. But, its a delicate balance.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, marijuana use can be for many reasons (including to have fun with friends) and I would think its a fair question to ask or explore with him. If he wants to use recreationally or occasionally, appropriate compromise might be more desirable. He might need direction to medical marijuana if that&#39;s an option. The danger of marijuana is the fact that its illegal and procuring it can sometimes be dangerous or involve potentially sketchy characters. These are all things that could be negotiated. <br/>\n<br/>\n*However, restriction or agreement to not drive a vehicle while high is paramount.*<br/>\n<br/>\n~Cheryl </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185586397,"authorName":"Lyla Wolfenstein","from":"Lyla Wolfenstein &lt;lylaw@...&gt;","profile":"lylawolf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: 21 year old son living at home...

If you are<br/>\nadament about taking his car you may want to consider making arrangements<br/>\nto make sure he has a ride to and from work.<br/>\n<br/>\nRenee ========================================================<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":301108410,"authorName":"Marina DeLuca-Howard","from":"Marina DeLuca-Howard &lt;delucahoward@...&gt;","profile":"matedgirl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] 21 year old son living at home...
