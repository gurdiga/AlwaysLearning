Listen to your boys and help them stay in their comfort zone.  If they begin something, let them know it&#39;s okay to change their minds.  They may decide not to attend once they get to the place.

We&#39;ve always been very gentle but matter-of-fact about death being a part of life, and have had several fish and gerbils die in our own household, for whom we&#39;ve held funerals, cried, said goodbye, and moved on (sometimes buying a new pet within hours of the last ones&#39; funeral - I always leave it up to the kids).  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my husband&#39;s great-uncle died two years ago (with whom my kids had a relationship), they both went to the wake and funeral, and I took it as my responsibility to be 100% attentive to their needs.  But other family members were happy to have them there, and they helped bring much levity to the luncheon afterwards.  When a friend of mine died tragically last year, they both chose not to attend, and stayed with their grandmother while my husband and I attended services.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve realized that my children have a good idea of how I&#39;m feeling, whether or not I think I&#39;m showing it, so I feel that it is much healthier for them and for their trust in me to be honest about big issues like death, and to allow them to be a part of the process as much as possible.  The rhythm and regularity of a funeral can be quite soothing and healing, and it is good to give children as much of a chance to say goodbye as adults.  They feel the loss as much as we do, keeping them out of process won&#39;t do them any favors, and may make it all much harder to understand and bear.<br/>\n<br/>\npeace,<br/>\nDavana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-However, I was made to attend the funeral of ...-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s recommending that children be taken to a  <br/>\n&gt; funeral against their will, or made to do anything.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe a babysitter could be hired to take the kids outside if they are  <br/>\n&gt; too restless or uncomfortable, and to bring them back in if they want  <br/>\n&gt; to try some more.

Grandad was dying from lung cancer.  He&#39;d been diagnosed 4 yrs earlier, had 2 surgeries and had been bedridden for most of 2 years.  He knew he was dying, and so did everyone else around him, but no one would let him talk about it.  He complained to my Mom (his daughter in law) that when he tried to say &#39;after I die&#39; his wife would shush him, saying you&#39;re not going to die.  His adult sons and daughter wouldn&#39;t discuss it; no one allowed him to talk of his death to his 13 and 16 yo sons.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen my parents came to visit shortly before he died, my Mom spent hours with him and was the only one with whom he could discuss his death.  She&#39;d lost her Dad very suddenly only 2 yrs before (he was 42) and knew how much she wished she&#39;d seen his death coming.  She&#39;s still sad and angry all these years later (that was in 1965) at how his family treated him when he was dying.  He felt so lonely and afraid in those months and no one would let him make any plans for what came next, no one would even grieve with him.  He was only 54 years old and did all that worrying by himself.   <br/>\n <br/>\nYears later, when my grandma (Mom&#39;s mom) was dying, it was much different.  Her daughters were with her, talking and remembering stories. They called her doctor and he contacted the hospice folks to come out and stay with them during the details afterwards.  I missed the funeral because we were vacationing in Hawaii when she died -- I&#39;d had known it would happen then, but she insisted we go anyway.  She said, &#39;just think of me while you&#39;re there, and it will be like I went too.&#39;  I knew then that she knew she wouldn&#39;t get to see me again.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy point being, that if you know someone is dying, acknowledge it.  Let them talk about it; your fears and discomfort just add more burden for them, and it&#39;s not loving or fair.<br/>\n <br/>\nSyl<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n***<br/>\n <br/>\nMy husband thought this was weird - he thought we shouldn&#39;t be talking in front of him as if he were dying.

It will touch their lives and how <br/>\nit makes them feel will be greatly affected by their perceptions and <br/>\nbeliefs of what death is.

My mom kept him home with the aid of Hospice.  During his last couple of days, all my siblings gathered at the house.  Dad was on a lot of morphine, so we don&#39;t know how much he was aware.  As we sat together, we talked about memories of our childhood and dad.  My husband thought this was weird - he thought we shouldn&#39;t be talking in front of him as if he were dying.  Guess he was still in denial about that!<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter dad died, we waited several hours before calling the funeral home.  We helped mom clean him up and dress him nicely and cried and comforted each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nDad&#39;s wishes were to be cremated.  He had wanted his ashes spread on the golf course where he was a member, but that didn&#39;t work out.  My brother&#39;s friend took us out on his sailboat.  We sang Amazing Grace, because dad had always loved that song.  We poured his ashes into Puget Sound, at the Tacoma Narrows.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery time we drive over the Narrows bridge, we say &quot;Hi Papa Steve&quot;.  Even Jackie, who was born after he died, says this.  She tells me she hung out with him in Heaven before she was born.  Maybe it&#39;s her way of *remembering* the grandfather she never knew.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think cemeteries are a waste of real estate.  Although many do a nice job of landscaping, they still aren&#39;t the kind of place I like to hang out.<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably the most, um, interesting memorial service I attended was that of a childhood friend&#39;s father.  He had a terminal disease that allowed him time to plan his own ceremony.  He made a videotape to be played there.  At the beginning, we saw his smiling face saying something like, &quot;Hi, I&#39;m coming to you from the other side.&quot;  I can&#39;t remember what else he said, but he was a fun, joyful person in life and the video reflected that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"J.

Not a very nice<br/>\nmemory.  <br/>\n <br/>\n I skipped my favorite Uncle&#39;s funeral shortly after that funeral because I<br/>\nwanted to remember him as he was, not in a casket.  I still regret not going<br/>\nbecause I realized after my grandmother&#39;s funeral many years later,  that<br/>\nfunerals *can* be nice and I wish I had been there to support my cousins.<br/>\nMy grandmother truly looked at peace and sweet.  It was nice to see her one<br/>\nlast time, although still a bit uncomfortable for me.  I guess the part I<br/>\nhate about funerals is that people always seem awkward and not sure how to<br/>\nact.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy *other* grandmother wasn&#39;t a very nice person outwardly. (and maybe not<br/>\neven inwardly) She didn&#39;t want a funeral and it didn&#39;t bother me that there<br/>\nwasn&#39;t one because I wasn&#39;t close to her. (no one was) I didn&#39;t feel a need<br/>\nto say goodbye.  We had a burial and the priest said some words (which at<br/>\nthe time were a laugh because it was about her love touching our lives and<br/>\nshe was such a cold unreachable person) while close family gathered around<br/>\nthe grave.  I don&#39;t think a funeral is a necessary thing all the time.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe just watched an old Little House on the Prairie show and it was about a<br/>\nlady who hadn&#39;t seen her children in years.  She had just been to a friend&#39;s<br/>\nfuneral and she thought it crazy that people would travel and make time to<br/>\nsee the dead, but not travel/make time to see the living while they could<br/>\nstill enjoy it.  She had notices sent to her children that she had died and<br/>\nthe wake/funeral was the following Wednesday.  They all showed up and near<br/>\nthe end of the wake, she presented herself after listening to all their<br/>\nconversations in a black veil.  It actually brought them all together after<br/>\nthe shock of it all.  :0) All I kept thinking was how did she parent....why<br/>\ndid her children stay away for over 15 years.  Although, the show made it<br/>\nseem like she had been a nice caring mother.  Not sure what my point<br/>\nwas....but it&#39;s true...people will make time for a funeral but not always<br/>\nfor the living.  Unfortunately, there is often more involved in it than just<br/>\ntime.....all those underlying family issues play a part.<br/>\n <br/>\nAngela <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":120206043,"authorName":"averyschmidt","from":"&quot;averyschmidt&quot; &lt;patti.schmidt2@...&gt;","profile":"averyschmidt","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"funerals, was Paul Harvery&#39;s letter","postDate":"1082727675","msgId":19359,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM2YjZkcitnbWQ4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEyZS40MDFjNTgxOC4yZGI5Yjc0ZkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":19353,"nextInTopic":19360,"prevInTime":19358,"nextInTime":19360,"topicId":19346,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... kids go. ... least ... bucket suddenly, ... money and ...
