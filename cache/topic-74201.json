Don&#39;t see it as a breakdown, or as a reversal, just as a conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly asked why she didn&#39;t have a bedtime, because all her friends had a a bedtime.  She was ten or eleven years old, I think.  I asked her if she wanted one and she said yes.  I asked her what time she thought it should be.  She said something—8, or 9:00.  So at that time that night, I said &quot;It&#39;s bedtime.&quot;   She was busy doing something, though, and said she wanted to keep doing it, and I said &quot;That&#39;s okay.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t (as I recall) make a deal about it.  I didn&#39;t explain &quot;that&#39;s why and that&#39;s how it&#39;s been&quot; or &quot;But you said you wanted a bedtime.&quot;  I figured she would think those things herself, and I&#39;m sure she did.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went to look in my Holly Diary (a word file; I kept one on each of my kids, and with every computer change I make sure those files survive—I have them in their earlier forms on earlier backup media :-) to see if I had written it then.  If I did, it was in an unschoooling discussion, and I could be remembering it wrong.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI did find this, though, when I searched for &quot;bedtime.&quot;  &quot;Bedtime&quot; in this report didn&#39;t mean a time by the clock, but when she said she wanted to go to bed.   She was born in November 1991, so so she was 11:<br/>\n<br/>\nApril 14, 2003<br/>\n<br/>\nEarlier this evening Holly asked me to tell her the story of Hamlet.  I<br/>\n<br/>\ndidn&#39;t ask why.  Maybe it&#39;s because on the Simpsons they did Hamlet<br/>\n<br/>\n(swordfight scene) the other night.   I asked if she wanted it right then or<br/>\n<br/>\nat bedtime.  Bedtime.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo instead of the fairytales we&#39;ve been doing, I turned off the light and lay<br/>\n<br/>\ndown and told her Hamlet, about 20 minutes worth.  At one point when I said<br/>\n<br/>\nPolonius didn&#39;t want Ophelia seeing Hamlet anymore, but she loved Hamlet and<br/>\n<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know why sometimes he was being nice, and sometimes mean, Holly said<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;This is like West Side Story, and like Romeo and Juliet.&quot;  Right near the<br/>\n<br/>\nend she was falling asleep.  She woke up when I was getting off the bed,<br/>\n<br/>\nthough, and I told her now I would tell her the way Wendy told Peter Pan: <br/>\n<br/>\nThe king dies, the queen dies, Ophelia dies, Laertes dies, and Hamlet dies. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd they all lived happily ever after.<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"","from":"&lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: &quot;My mom doesn&#39;t care what I wear&quot;","postDate":"1399153108","msgId":74207,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGxrM25raysxMDRvZmR0QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGxrM2U3aysxZTQ2ZmFzQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGxrM2U3aysxZTQ2ZmFzQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":74205,"nextInTopic":74208,"prevInTime":74206,"nextInTime":74208,"topicId":74201,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Do you care what she wears?

I&#39;m wondering if the parents of other older unschooled teens have had similar experiences and how it&#39;s worked out over time.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>It sounds like my daughter has been comparing notes with her friends (some homeschooled, some public schooled) and everyone else&#39;s moms have strict rules about what they can and cannot wear and ongoing battles trying to push those limits. The hems of shorts must be lower than the fingertips and Mom will check sort of stuff.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I can count on one hand (more like half of one hand) the times I&#39;ve put my foot down about an outfit. NOT because I let my daughter wear anything she wants, but because she almost never gives me reason to object to anything. Alex has this really polished Audrey Hepburn kind of poise, is almost always tastefully dolled up unless there&#39;s a reason not to be (she loves her hair and makeup and shoes - &nbsp;in that way, we&#39;re polar opposites) and has good judgement about what it&#39;s appropriate to wear to which places.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If we leave out the annual bikini negotiations, which are minor (why do the cutest prints have to be on the skimpiest suits that look most likely to disintegrate?) I think the last time I objected to a purchase was three years ago. And I didn&#39;t say no (although I was thinking it loudly), I asked her if that particular jumper was going to be okay if she suddenly reached up with both arms. She&#39;d put it back on the rack before we left the store. And I wouldn&#39;t buy the $40 t-shirt that was on super cheap fabric.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I did forbid &quot;boys are dumb&quot; type T-shirts long ago, because she has three younger brothers and I think they&#39;re mean and obnoxious. And I&#39;ve suggested putting an extra stitch in the necklines of some dresses and tops to bring them up just a bit, or layering something underneath. (We&#39;re talking an inch or two one ones that were really cute but seemed a bit gapey) But I think that was so long ago that she just does it automatically now and has forgotten that we ever discussed it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>And she made the low-cut jeans decision for herself many years ago after we spent an hour walking through a factory tour behind an adult woman who was having a spectacular wardrobe malfunction and spent the entire time hiking up her jeans. I might have quietly drawn my daughter&#39;s attention to that, because it was at the point where it was hard to find reasonably cut jeans even for pre-teens at that point and I wanted her to see why I was so picky about waistlines. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I can&#39;t remember what age it was (10 or 11 maybe) when her friend&#39;s mother saw my daughter wearing eye-shadow and jumped on me. Alex had been out with me all day, had spent time with her grandmother and great-grandmother and none of us had even noticed it. It was subtle and not at all objectionable and I&#39;d never set a &quot;you must be this high to wear eye shadow outside of the house&quot; rule. It had never occurred to me until I got jumped on by the other mother. Honestly, I was busy enough making sure that all of the boys had shoes on without scrutinizing my daughter&#39;s face to see what she might have on it. But her friend was always trying to get away with something and in that house it was more about whether she had something on her face than whether anyone would have seen it or not. &nbsp; We were headed out to play at the park -- I wouldn&#39;t have objected to lipstick or face paint with animal stripes.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>That former-best-friend&#39;s mother was obsessive to the point of ridiculous about clothing choices. Some was a religious restriction (which she ignored herself whenever it suited her) and I think a lot of was because the mother had her first child at 15 and saw both our girls as a time bomb to be defused. Her daughter knew that there were limits to be pushed and made it her mission to push as much as possible.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So it&#39;s not news to my daughter that other girls have family dress-codes....but this week it&#39;s been translated to &quot;You don&#39;t care what I wear.&quot; &nbsp;<span style=\"word-spacing:normal;line-height:1.25;\">But it&#39;s not like there was anything to stop her from doing (except maybe that one jumper that she talked herself out of) &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Have other older unschoolers had this &quot;Hey I didn&#39;t have rules!&quot; reaction -- and do they get over it?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Michelle&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74195,"nextTopicId":74214}}
