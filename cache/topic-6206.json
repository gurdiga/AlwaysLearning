I <br/>\nhave a huge room for just that stuff.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLots of things sit on the shelf until a 4 yo shows up and he gets to <br/>\nplay with something cool.  Once or twice a year teenage girls are here <br/>\nand they get down my beading box.  It only sits on the shelf until they <br/>\nget here because I can&#39;t see well enough anymore to use it.  I would <br/>\nnever dream of giving that away, though.

And this is probably <br/>\npathological, but it gives me a thrill to know I have this stuff.

(I didn&#39;t go out <br/>\nand buy tin snips because I thought someone *else* might need them some <br/>\nday!)
