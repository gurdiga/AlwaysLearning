We borrowed it from a friend.  It is a <br/>\nseries of workbooks, flash cards, and simple reading books.  It is <br/>\norganized by color (five different levels) and there are a couple of <br/>\nmusic tapes.  But I&#39;m sure you can find a few workbooks and simple <br/>\nreading books for each level for a lot less money.  We still have them <br/>\non loan and have had them for about 5 months.  They were much sought <br/>\nafter but in reality have been used 2 or 3 times in this house.  I could <br/>\nbring a box or two of them to camp in May if he wants to look at it.  <br/>\nThe whole set is 6 boxes!  The person I am borrowing them from is in no <br/>\nrush to get them back.  See how useful they are?!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, regarding the unschooling part, which was what you were <br/>\nasking about.  Some times our kids may just want to try classes, the <br/>\nlearning tools, even school.

You&#39;ve asked him to trust you <br/>\nwith your idea to work for 5 minutes a day.  If he really doesn&#39;t want <br/>\nto do it, you&#39;ll stop right?  One thing maybe Jack doesn&#39;t realize is <br/>\nthat you&#39;ll still be working with him for the 5 minutes, just using the <br/>\nHOP tools.  It&#39;s not HOP instead of you.  Unless there is some new thing <br/>\nI don&#39;t know about???   My feeling is that we can&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t <br/>\nprotect them from the outside influences.  We can help them negotiate <br/>\nthem, but ultimately it&#39;s up to them whether or not to be influenced.  I <br/>\nguess we can only let them know that it is OK with us that they learn at <br/>\ntheir own pace but if they want to pick up the pace (for whatever <br/>\nreason) we will try to help.

Homeschooling 7years.<br/>\nI&#39;ve rarely worried about my older two with learning what they <br/>\nneeded, except for a little with math with my oldest.  Still find <br/>\nmyself needing to let go and trust, but it can be hard when she is <br/>\nconcerned herself.  I usually end up offering to help her learn some <br/>\nbasic math stuff, I buy or remind her of games we have.  I print out <br/>\nwork sheets and help her through them, talk about concepts and ideas <br/>\nof real life math and try to help her relax and not worry if she <br/>\nisn&#39;t doing algebra like kids in school.  I took it in high school <br/>\nand college and can&#39;t do it either.  She really isn&#39;t into math.  She <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t enjoy trying to figure things out, though she completely <br/>\nunderstands all the math that comes with her bass lessons or  when <br/>\nshe took a fashion design class and had to figure measurments.<br/>\nI wish we could surround ourselves with unschoolers, but like I&#39;ve <br/>\ncomplained before, I&#39;ve been searching for years in my area, with no <br/>\nluck.<br/>\nJack is my real issue for this post.  I never had to deal with <br/>\nreading with Carly or Sam.  Carly learned while she was in 1st grade <br/>\nand Sam went to pre school and k and while not fully reading after k, <br/>\nhe steadily figured it out within the next year.  I gave full credit <br/>\nto his game boy, but he probably did get a lot of basic ideas while <br/>\nin school, to help him build on.<br/>\nSo Jack&#39;s not reading at 7.  No big deal....  <br/>\nBut, it is a big deal.<br/>\nLike I said, we know no unschoolers in our area.  His buddies, who go <br/>\nto school, have learned to read.  Hooked on Phonics commercials show <br/>\nworried parents and sad kids until they found HOP.  Now they are <br/>\njoyful!<br/>\nHe loves playing Game Cube games, but mostly bypasses the reading <br/>\nstuff or has me read things when he realizes the info. must be <br/>\nimportant.  He plays computer games like Reader Rabbit, and lots of <br/>\nother software meant to help kids learn to read.  We read books <br/>\ntogether.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t doubt he&#39;ll learn eventually, but I&#39;m finding it hard not to <br/>\nhelp him along, with my main thought being, I don&#39;t want him to feel <br/>\nlike he&#39;s lacking.  I don&#39;t see how he wouldn&#39;t feel that way, when <br/>\neven his 4 yo cousin, who we will be seeing this summer can read.<br/>\nTelling him that kids learn at all different ages, while true, seems <br/>\nlike lip service, when everyone he knows except for a few kids <br/>\nyounger than him, can read.<br/>\nHe came to me and asked for HOP.  I told him I could help him learn <br/>\nif he wanted some help.  &quot;No&quot;, HOP had a video that would show him <br/>\nhow to read.  I told him to give me 5 minutes a day to show him stuff <br/>\nabout letters and words that might help him learn, and if by the <br/>\nsummer he wasn&#39;t reading, and he still wanted HOP, we would get it.<br/>\nSo here I am giving my kid reading lessons!  <br/>\nHe wasn&#39;t too into the idea of it being me and not HOP that would <br/>\nhelp him learn, so I offered an incentive.  A quarter for each word <br/>\nhe learns.  He already knew a few, like MOM, DAD, NO, so we listed <br/>\nthose, and that instant money gave him some motivation to learn some <br/>\nmore.<br/>\nWe started off with vowel sounds.  Long and short.  That one little <br/>\nlesson opened up a doorway of &quot;Aha!&quot; for him.  He can figure out <br/>\nwords like t-o-p, and t-a-p-e, now.<br/>\nWhenever I read about unschooling, it&#39;s always to trust your kids, <br/>\nthey will learn.  I&#39;ve always agreed with that, but sometimes there <br/>\nare outside forces that you can&#39;t shield them from that have an <br/>\neffect on them.  <br/>\nI felt like I had to make a choice between, trying to help him not be <br/>\ninfluenced by our world, for what was the right time for him to read, <br/>\nand me not being too influence by the unschooling world and help him <br/>\nlearn, now.<br/>\nSo, have I lapsed from unschooling, or did I just trust in my child <br/>\nin a different way.  I feel like I was hearing his concerns about not <br/>\nreading in the things he said (not just the asking for HOP).<br/>\nI do feel like my own fears were mixed in as well, so it&#39;s a little <br/>\nmurky for me as to weather I&#39;m on the right path.<br/>\nHe&#39;s not initiating the lessons and he only lasts a few minutes with <br/>\nthem, but he is learning from them.  We can both see that.<br/>\nAny thought?<br/>\nJoanna<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, a little side note.  I am now having to take Game Cube lessons <br/>\nfrom him.  I didn&#39;t put it together til just now, but maybe he is <br/>\ntrying to restore some balance by being my teacher is something he&#39;s <br/>\ngood at.
