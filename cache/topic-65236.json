We have said that for a long time: she would enjoy a best friend. We are traveling right now (currently in Costa Rica) and it is very hard to mingle with local kids. Yesterday at the beach a little girl wanted to play with her but she kept talking with her baby voice and climbing all over her dad in the sea... I asked her if she wanted me to go with her to play with the little girl (she was building a castle alone), but she didn’t... I remember how hard it is to connect with new friends at first. <br/>\n<br/>\nBack at home, it is a bit similar. When someone shows interest to her, she starts being annoying, hitting them, etc. and it always ends up that they (the friends) team up with the twins against Mathilde... And it feels like she has taken up that role now... I don’t really know how to help her out...<br/>\n<br/>\nMeredith, you are totally right about men. I realize that I have been assuming a lot of stuff, based on my on guilt (she was not a planned child and was supposed to be aborted... but since we lived up North and there was only 2 abortions per week, I had to wait 3 months... which obviously was not an option. So we decided to welcome her and obviously are super happy we did, but there was a lot of fear involved since I almost died giving birth to the twins...).<br/>\n<br/>\nI will remember what you say about the direct answer (giving information). It is very true that we often assume that it is better to state our feelings and talk them out of their actions, but it is not, most of the time, at least for little children...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks a lot,<br/>\n<br/>\nCatherine<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: I don&#39;t know how to heal the relationship with my 6 yo","postDate":"1327794878","msgId":65331,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg3NzYzRTM0LTg1NkEtNEE3MC04QTlELTRBRjlDRDdCNDMyREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpnMW5sbis2b3VmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpnMW5sbis2b3VmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65323,"nextInTopic":65341,"prevInTime":65330,"nextInTime":65332,"topicId":65236,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Clear and direct is generally better than blah blah blah, my feelings, blah blah. -=- Meredith wrote that and it s worth repeating.

You&#39;re focusing on &quot;twins&quot; but maybe it&#39;s more a &quot;best friend&quot; thing - both her sisters have a best friend, but she doesn&#39;t.

But yes, maybe it is me that is making that up. It’s totally possible. Mathilde was a totally happy child until she got sick with chicken pox complications at 18 months (pretty traumatizing hospital experience, I wasn’t there, only her dad was) and I stopped breastfeeding her pretty much around that time (mostly her decision since we were quite separated at the time because she had to go to the hospital every 6-8 hours to get antibiotics through IV, I was home with the twins and JF was with her at the hospital). Anyways, it all started around this time. She kind of became aware of her sisters special bond and was trying to separate them (still does to this day... she promises stuff to one of them – money, a toy, etc. – in exchange for twinship). She is VERY fond of men, even since she was 3... She would follow the guy that was building our barn everywhere, then the guy who was caring for the neighbors’ horses. It’s like she wants to be loved so badly...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I hear what you are saying: Yes, I probably do not listen to her as well as I could. I am sure I can do better and I will try my best. I can always do better. What you make me realize is that I get stuck trying to understand why she is acting like this and feeling sorry for herself and myself and not even seeing how I can be creative and make the situation better for her... like in the pillow situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what you are saying is that if/when she pinches me, I need to stop talking and just stop her. Is that what you are saying?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all a lot for your insights.

Somewhat ironically, the NVC, consensus, and non-coercion folks seem to be the most likely to try to talk their kids into submission, explaining and explaining and explaining until the kids give in (if they&#39;re lucky). <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] I don&#39;t know how to heal the relationship with my 6 yo","postDate":"1327606230","msgId":65282,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkzRTg4MTg1LTI0OTItNEFEQy05ODczLTg3QjU5MTc0ODMzNEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDk0QTE0NkFFLTUwRjMtNDE5Qi05MkQ3LUZENzE1RTE4OTZEMEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGpmbmlhdit0OWhpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NzQ0NDE0OUUtQ0VDQi00QjJCLTkyNEItQzE1N0E1RTkwMTFEQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8Q0FHMHVXOG1CTVpta3BPRHk4bmlPX2ZLTndta0FrWis1RU5jLWI4TUUwN0FZX1I2QnVnQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8OTRBMTQ2QUUtNTBGMy00MTlCLTkyRDctRkQ3MTVFMTg5NkQwQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65276,"nextInTopic":65284,"prevInTime":65281,"nextInTime":65283,"topicId":65236,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Quoting a list I started earlier, and I ll bring another list from elsewhere: -=-What priorities can mess up unschooling when they come first? -=- discipline ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1012330693\">Quoting a list I started earlier, and I&#39;ll bring another list from elsewhere:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-What priorities can mess up unschooling<br/>\nwhen they come first? -=-<br/>\n<br/>\ndiscipline<br/>\nobedience<br/>\ncompetitive academics<br/>\ncompetitive sports (especially if the parents are pushing it)<br/>\nJapanese home decorating (too sparse a house)<br/>\npolitics/cynicism/activism<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are surely others.<br/>\n<br/>\n================================<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom a chat on October 8, 2010; Pamela Corkey started the list and others contributed:<br/>\nExample of priorities than can hamper unschooling:<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving control over your household<br/>\nImpressing the neighbors<br/>\nMoney<br/>\nBragging rights<br/>\nExtreme dietary restrictions<br/>\nAnti-&quot;violence&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Protecting kids from themselves&quot;<br/>\nCareer<br/>\nClean and tidy house; everything in its place<br/>\nFitness and health<br/>\nQuiet; discouragement of enthusiasm<br/>\nAiming for &quot;age-appropriate capability&quot;<br/>\nRaising &quot;independent&quot; children<br/>\nWealthy suburban &quot;lifestyle&quot;<br/>\nOrganic eco-conscious &quot;lifestyle&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Everyone has a lifestyle, but putting that first ahead of your relationships can destroy things fast.&quot; <br/>\n�Pamela Corkey<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/priorities\">http://sandradodd.com/priorities</a><br/>\n<br/>\n=========<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] I don&#39;t know how to heal the relationship with my 6 yo","postDate":"1327592167","msgId":65276,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk0QTE0NkFFLTUwRjMtNDE5Qi05MkQ3LUZENzE1RTE4OTZEMEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBRzB1VzhtQk1abWtwT0R5OG5pT19mS053bWtBa1orNUVOYy1iOE1FMDdBWV9SNkJ1Z0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGpmbmlhdit0OWhpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NzQ0NDE0OUUtQ0VDQi00QjJCLTkyNEItQzE1N0E1RTkwMTFEQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8Q0FHMHVXOG1CTVpta3BPRHk4bmlPX2ZLTndta0FrWis1RU5jLWI4TUUwN0FZX1I2QnVnQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65274,"nextInTopic":65282,"prevInTime":65275,"nextInTime":65277,"topicId":65236,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I had written: Non-coercion doesn t always mesh well with unschooling necessarily, depending what aspect of non-coercion you put first in your life.

She will never be as old as they are. And right now, while they are 7 1/2 and 6 the year and a half will make a big difference. She may not want to hear anything in those moments of feeling less than and low and bad. Linnaea will sometimes complain about how much better Simon is at something or t&#39;other than she is. Usually I agree with her. Usually she&#39;s right and not just exaggerating because she feels low. She&#39;s talking about it, usually, because she feels low. But he is better than she is at some things and she&#39;s better than he is at others. She just isn&#39;t striving so much in the areas where she is already competent. So she doesn&#39;t notice those things as much. But mostly she isn&#39;t looking for me to tell her that he&#39;s not better than she is, or that she&#39;s better than other areas. She feels badly and she wants to be comforted or helped or fed or cuddled or something.<br/>\n So I try and figure out which it is and not work to gloss over her sense that Simon is better than she is at something. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;For instance, we are at the restaurant and hungry and wants her food right away (totally understandable).

Really tired after a big day of too much going on. Give her your pillow and snuggle up and when she&#39;s asleep slip it out from under her. And if you can&#39;t come up with a solution, like rolling up a blanket into a pillow or using a couch cushion or a towel or clothes or the problem isn&#39;t a pillow, be sorry and move on. That doesn&#39;t mean she has to move on, but you can let her be upset and hold her while you aren&#39;t upset in response. Don&#39;t take it personally, don&#39;t add to the energy of the moment, buffer her against her own disappointment and recognise that at 6 she just isn&#39;t ready to handle big days where she is too tired and too hungry to cope with the smaller moments of delay and dissatisfaction. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Today, we went to a zoo here in Costa Rica and it was just beautiful and she whined all day because she did not want to carry her water bottle (I was overloaded and I asked each of them to carry their water bottle), she spent the whole day saying everything was ugly, and again telling me I was stupid, kicking me, etc.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When Linnaea was 7 we met up with my dad in London and went to the British Museum after spending a night in a lovely hotel. It was all very exciting and very active and very new. My dad is a bit of a forced march kind of fellow. He sets his mind on his plans for the day and is difficult to sway. So David and I worked to buffer Linnaea from the intensity of the day. She still had a couple of moments in the Oriental arts section of the museum. We have a fabulous picture of her lying with her hair hanging off the back of a settee. But it took both David and I knowing that the day would be too much for her, and working to keep her engaged and happy and amused throughout this giant museum. It took finding the amusing things to look at instead of just the historically interesting one. It took carrying her occasionally. It took a willingness to let all the wonder and the beauty of the museum exist without me necessarily having to see it all. It took being very<br/>\n aware of her needs and much less feeling that I was being asked to miss out on something simply because she was too little to be able to handle a full day at the British Museum. <br/>\n<br/>\nLower your expectations. She&#39;s 6 and she&#39;s tired and she&#39;s hungry and she doesn&#39;t necessarily see the beauty in the Costa Rican zoo. Throw away her water bottle and share your water with her if it&#39;s too much for both of you to carry. Throw away something else and carry her water bottle. Don&#39;t ask her to do more than she is capable of. Sit down more than you walk. Find cool places to sit on the ground and watch the animals from there. Look to her as your guide for what is possible and don&#39;t look to what you want to have done at the Costa Rican zoo to tell you how your day should go. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":356429371,"authorName":"lydia reiter","from":"lydia reiter &lt;chozebah@...&gt;","profile":"chozebah","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] I don&#39;t know how to heal the relationship with my 6 yo","postDate":"1327472649","msgId":65244,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMjc0NzI2NDkuODY5MjMuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjQ1MzA3Lm1haWwuc3AxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpmbmlhdit0OWhpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpmbmlhdit0OWhpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65240,"nextInTopic":65245,"prevInTime":65243,"nextInTime":65245,"topicId":65236,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Today, we went to a zoo here in Costa Rica and it was just beautiful and she whined all day because she did not want to carry her water bottle (I was","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-864953779\">***Today, we went to a zoo here in Costa Rica and it was just beautiful and she whined all day because she did not want to carry her water bottle <br/>\n(I was overloaded and I asked each of them to carry their water bottle), she spent the whole day saying everything was ugly, and again telling <br/>\nme I was stupid, kicking me, etc.***<br/>\n<br/>\n***But I am at the point where I feel like I don&#39;t want to go out with here anymore because it is just ruining the day for everybody else that <br/>\ncomes with us...***<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe a whole day is too much of an outing for her.  Maybe the 7 year olds can carry their own water bottles but she is just not ready to take on that responsibility.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nLydia Reiter<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n From: catherinemforest &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cforest@...\">cforest@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Tuesday, January 24, 2012 6:28 PM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] I don&#39;t know how to heal the relationship with my 6 yo<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nDear friends,<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always believed in non cohersion and unschooling and working with my children...

Different people have different levels of tolerance for going-n-doing, and maybe that&#39;s coming into play a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, keep in mind that she may be picking up on the exasperation you&#39;re feeling. I know that when I&#39;m feeling out of sorts and probably not a whole lot of fun to be around, that&#39;s when I sure need my husband to be extra-patient and extra-kind, until I can get past that funk. If I feel like he&#39;s getting frustrated with me (which is totally understandable on his part!), odds are good I&#39;ll end up in tears (because I was probably borderline-tears already). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep all this in mind when my son&#39;s the one who&#39;s feeling out of sorts -- if I begin to feel exasperated, I take a deep breathe and consciously relax my shoulders and let a strong feeling of love wash over me, then I&#39;m able to give that to him and to feel compassion for whatever he might be feeling. With time and practice, it&#39;s become easier and more natural. But I still have times when I have to &quot;pull myself up by my bootstraps&quot; to get to that point.<br/>\n<br/>\n===everything has to revolve around her or she is throwing a tantrum, whining, etc.===<br/>\n<br/>\nReally? EVERYTHING???<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you stop and think about every single thing that happens in her day, is it really true that everything revolves around her and she&#39;s throwing a tantrum or whining if not?<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, tantrums and whining are good indicators something else is going on. Hunger and tiredness are biggies. Feeling like she doesn&#39;t have much control over what she&#39;s asked to do or participate in can trigger tantrums and whining. <br/>\n<br/>\n===I spend one on one time with her regularly (which she craves)===<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you feel she&#39;s craving more time, find ways to give it to her. It may take more to fill her cup than it does to fill yours, or her siblings&#39;. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you fold laundry, go fold it on her bed and chat with her, or fold it on your bed and ask if she wants to keep you company. Have her pull up a chair when you&#39;re prepping food or cooking or doing dishes. Maybe she&#39;ll want to help, or maybe she&#39;ll be happy hanging out with you and not helping. When she takes a shower or bath, hang out in the bathroom with her and chat with her. <br/>\n<br/>\n===show her how much I love her ALL THE TIME===<br/>\n<br/>\nNot everyone gives or receives love in the same way. It may seem to you you&#39;re giving her more than enough love, whereas to her it may not feel like enough. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI did a search on Sandra&#39;s site for &quot;enough&quot; and found this quote by Joyce about &quot;needs&quot;, on this page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/needs\">http://sandradodd.com/needs</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Original Poster: He needs a lot of physical stimulation which is very draining.<br/>\n&quot;Joyce: And imagine what it&#39;s like to be bursting with that need. Imagine what <br/>\nit&#39;s like asking for it and being turned down. I&#39;m not saying that to <br/>\nmake you feel guilty. What you need is a mental shift away from <br/>\nthinking he needs more than you can give.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If someone needs 3 glasses of water a day and only gets 2, they&#39;ll <br/>\n </span></blockquote>spend the rest of the day trying to get that 3rd glass. So it will <br/>\nseem to others like this person&#39;s constantly thirsty and can never get <br/>\nenough. But if he gets 3 glasses and can have as many as he wants, he <br/>\nwon&#39;t seem thirsty at all. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;He can&#39;t need less by being given less. He can&#39;t modify his needs to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>meet what you&#39;re willing to give. He can lose faith that you&#39;ll meet <br/>\nhis needs. He can look elsewhere to others offering to give what you <br/>\nwon&#39;t. (It&#39;s how predators work.)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you can mentally shift away from seeing his demands as too much to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>his needs being large and you as the one who is privileged with <br/>\nmeeting them, it will help a lot.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It will also help to shift away from stuffing down your own needs to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>meet his. Shift to finding ways to meet his needs AND yours.
