They are going on about the rates of drinking in  <br/>\nteenagers, and the risks to their developing brain, etc. and then  <br/>\nthey say, authoritatively, that parents need to impose MORE rules and  <br/>\nconsequences to stop this drinking epidemic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI felt SO upset about them playing into this fear-based parenting  <br/>\nthat seems so prevalent - MORE consequences is the root of the  <br/>\nproblem in my opinion, and MORE rules and consequences can only cause  <br/>\nteenagers to sneak around, and/or feel shamed and un-loved, which I&#39;m  <br/>\nsure leads to more drinking - gotta numb the pain of being  <br/>\nmisunderstood and disrespected I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about MORE family time?  MORE connection?  MORE trust?   <br/>\nRespecting and encouraging their passions and interests?  I am always  <br/>\namazed that in a typical high school setting when a teenager violates  <br/>\nschool rules or gets poor grades, they often take away the  <br/>\n&quot;privilege&quot; of their beloved sports or arts activity (as an  <br/>\nincentive?), and we wonder why teenage suicide is on the rise...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEmily<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33784,"nextTopicId":33642}}
