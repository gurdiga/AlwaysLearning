It might help her to know that! Reading looks like a magic trick revolving around words and letters... but actually, like any magic trick the real &quot;magic&quot; is the part you don&#39;t see. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I have no understanding of how learning to read âhappensâ.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s complicated! It involves several different sets of skills working together - and a slightly different set of skills depending on one&#39;s perceptual preferences. Some people are more visual, some more auditory, some more kinesthetic - everyone combines that to and extent when reading, but the exact mix varies considerably. Really, anything she does - Any kind of game or project or activity - will tie in to how she&#39;s learning to read. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh! and a big part of &quot;learning to read&quot; is really learning about literacy in a wider sense. When kids learn to read early, all that happens After they crack the code, but when kids learn to read later, they&#39;re still learning about literacy itself. In that sense, your daughter is learning to read in a different order than what you expected - but she&#39;s still learning all the same/right things. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;We do a lot of driving around!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Audio books - and if she worries that she&#39;s &quot;not learning to read&quot; by listening, reassure her that she Is, she&#39;s learning about books and stories, the flow of language, vocabularly, grammar, plot, character development, symbolism... etc. Radio programs, too - NPR (in the US) is a good source of talk radio and newspaper-style reporting, as well as some entertaining shows and some actual on-air word games (Says You is very fun and funny). TED talks. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Playing with words or letters on paper somehow....? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Pictionary! and there&#39;s a Lego version: Creationary. <br/>\n<br/>\nMemory games of all kinds - memorizing things for fun, the memory game with cards, shell games, the party game where you look at a picture or collection of things and try to name them all a few minutes later.

We have also had scavenger hunts where there is a start and then each piece of paper says where to go next.  <br/>\n&gt; I use very repetitive sayings for each game and keep the words simple, phrases short, and help read when needed. You can supplement with pictures, too. Example - for sticky notes on the animals, they might all say &quot;I like______.&quot; Then finish with a word and a little picture to show that word cookies, cake, etc...whatever your daughter will think is funny. <br/>\n&gt; Look through photos or pictures in magazines and have your daughter come up with funny captions which you write underneath. You can go back and read them whenever she likes. <br/>\n&gt; When playing word games like rhyming, and coming up with words beginning w/ specific letters of the alphabet, try to go with themes and words your daughter thinks are funny.  My son loves bodily functions so our games often seem to revolve around poop, pee, farting, etc. <br/>\n&gt; Recently, my son has been asking to spell things and the other day in the car he wanted me to give him words to spell. It turned into a &quot;game show&quot; complete with outrageous &quot;prizes&quot; (like a 20,000 foot eel) for each word.  I used short easy words and said the sounds slowly so he could pick out each letter. Your daughter might like a &quot;game show&quot; game like that (and you could adapt it in so many ways) since you could think of funny things for her to &quot;win.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Ask your daughter for game ideas, too.

All the fun ideas I find require a level of knowledge that my daughter doesnât have yet. ----<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son also loves all things to do with humor and he&#39;s also 7, so I have included a few word/ letter games he has enjoyed recently.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI have put sticky notes on his stuffed animals to show what they are saying (they always &quot;say&quot; something funny).   We have also had scavenger hunts where there is a start and then each piece of paper says where to go next.  <br/>\nI use very repetitive sayings for each game and keep the words simple, phrases short, and help read when needed.  You can supplement with pictures, too.  Example - for sticky notes on the animals, they might all say &quot;I like______.&quot;  Then finish with a word and a little picture to show that word  cookies, cake, etc...whatever your daughter will think is funny.   <br/>\nLook through photos or pictures in magazines and have your daughter come up with funny captions which you write underneath.  You can go back and read them whenever she likes.  <br/>\nWhen playing word games like rhyming, and coming up with words beginning w/ specific letters of the alphabet, try to go with themes and words your daughter thinks are funny.  My son loves bodily functions so our games often seem to revolve around poop, pee, farting, etc.   <br/>\nRecently, my son has been asking to spell things and the other day in the car he wanted me to give him words to spell.  It turned into a &quot;game show&quot; complete with outrageous &quot;prizes&quot; (like a 20,000 foot eel)  for each word.  I used short easy words and said the sounds slowly so he could pick out each letter.  Your daughter might like a &quot;game show&quot; game like that (and you could adapt it in so many ways) since you could think of funny things for her to &quot;win.&quot;<br/>\nAsk your daughter for game ideas, too.
