She uses a tablet (a Playbook in our case), so it is a touch screen.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMy 5 year old generally prefers other activities to watching tv, but sometimes gets interested in what his little sister is watching.  The way she moves back and forth in the story and never lets it play long before jumping around again drives him crazy.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhen I see this happening, I offer my son the same show on something else - we have a second tablet and a media player, which is like a hard drive for the tv.     \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI realize that multiple copies of the same shows/movies might not always be possible, but you might be able to interest one of them in something else eslewhere.  And if your boys have the option of watching things separately in their own ways when they want, then the one who skips around may not mind watching in a more linear way when he and his brother want to watch something together - when the togetherness is more important than the how of the watching. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nRegards,\r<br/>\nMairi.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n-----Original Message-----\r<br/>\nFrom: Jessica Strader &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lovelyjessie82@...\">lovelyjessie82@...</a>&gt;\r<br/>\nSender: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>\r<br/>\nDate: Tue, 12 Jun 2012 17:55:55 \r<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;\r<br/>\nReply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>\r<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Question about movies\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThis question was sparked by a discussion on the Radical Unschooling\r<br/>\nFacebook page, particularly this quote,\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n***I thought about the way Noor uses technology, literally, in a physical\r<br/>\nsense: she rewinds, fast-fowrwards, pauses a shot, watches movies in a\r<br/>\ncompletely non-linear fashion, plays the same scene over and over and over\r<br/>\nagain.....she bends the media to suit her purpose--she manipulates it, she\r<br/>\nactively controls not just the technology itself, but the story (the one\r<br/>\nthat&#39;s allegedly being shoved down her throat against her will), and what\r<br/>\n&quot;story&quot; means.
