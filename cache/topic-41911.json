I&#39;d love to have that again, if  <br/>\nanyone kept it or knows what I&#39;m talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of the &quot;idiot savant&quot; cases, I know it&#39;s possible, but it&#39;s  <br/>\nnot ideal.   The term &quot;idiot savant&quot; is from French, is a couple of  <br/>\nhundred years old, and describes people who have one extreme genius  <br/>\ntrait, but otherwise can hardly wipe their own asses.    It&#39;s saved  <br/>\nfor really extreme cases, like a concert pianist who can&#39;t dress  <br/>\nhimself or someone who can do sums and calculate pi, but doesn&#39;t know  <br/>\nwhere he lives.  (I made those up, maybe; I&#39;m not going to check  <br/>\nparticular case studies, but am going on memory of readings and  <br/>\naccounts from psychology professors when I had those guys in my life.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a friend who had done a master&#39;s in geology, in Philadelphia.   <br/>\nHis thesis involved the Jemez Mountains in New Mexico, their  <br/>\nformation, and their volcanic/geothermal this&#39;n&#39;that.   (For those  <br/>\nwho might be reading aloud, it sounds like &quot;HAYmess.&quot;)   When he was  <br/>\nin his 30&#39;s, he came to see me and I drove him up into the Jemez.  He  <br/>\nwas verbally knowledgeable, and was telling me things I&#39;d never  <br/>\nknown, but the emotion of him seeing those features and the soda dam  <br/>\nand the sulphur spring and the waterfalls and the Valle Grande (a  <br/>\nhuge caldera that doesn&#39;t look so big until you realize that the ants  <br/>\nare cattle and the bales of hay are pickups) was huge.  He was  <br/>\nlearning right there, in front of me, seeing that GIGANTIC mountain  <br/>\nsky from where he was already 8,000 feet up.   I think it was like  <br/>\nsomeone who had read about and written about chocolate, but had never  <br/>\nsmelled it or touched it or tasted it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone could recite &quot;times tables&quot; but had never so much as  <br/>\ncounted on her fingers, what would she &quot;know&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41880,"nextTopicId":41925}}
