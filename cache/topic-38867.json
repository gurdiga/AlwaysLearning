Like Sandra says, they want some<br/>\nfunny little badge of honor (which actually *is* nonexistent) without having<br/>\nto change the way they&#39;re doing things.  We can have peaceful parent/child<br/>\ninteractions if we tweak or outright change our thinking, and without<br/>\nchange, we can&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s funny that we can physically compel kids into situations that they<br/>\ndon&#39;t want and the minute the way to have peaceful interactions with our<br/>\nkids is suggested, there&#39;s offense!  This rather than being compelled to<br/>\nchange our behavior, rather than being put into situations we don&#39;t want,<br/>\nwhich happens to many kids everyday.  Shoo... go off and play and let me<br/>\ntalk with the girls for one stinky li&#39;l minute, will ya?  That&#39;s what<br/>\nplaytime at the park is about for some moms.

I created it wanting it to be a list with<br/>\n&gt;  people who were trying to be radical unschoolers and wanting to be<br/>\n&gt;  able to be frank and not smile and nod when people talk about how<br/>\n&gt;  threatening to take all their child&#39;s toys away is part of how they<br/>\n&gt;  unschool.  I really like the clear discussions here and on lists like<br/>\n&gt;  this and they are a huge part of the reason that I am doing things the<br/>\n&gt;  way I am now.  At any rate, on this list I posted something that was<br/>\n&gt;  similar to what I would have posted here (even gentler, I thought) and<br/>\n&gt;  then, from my point of view, the shit hit the fan.  It really upset<br/>\n&gt;  several people and we talked a lot about how to talk to each other.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  After a lot of discussion, it seemed that there are some people for<br/>\n&gt;  whom this style of discussion is very unpleasant.  I find it clear,<br/>\n&gt;  direct and uncluttered.  I prefer it this way.  Several other people<br/>\n&gt;  on the list did not feel that way.  I remember reading a few people on<br/>\n&gt;  a local list say that they don&#39;t find reading the big unschooling<br/>\n&gt;  lists helpful as it just makes them feel bad.  As much as I wanted to<br/>\n&gt;  create a regional list with that same feel (only you get to meet every<br/>\n&gt;  now and then) it seemed as though there were a lot of people who<br/>\n&gt;  wanted to be on the list and wanted to be radical unschoolers, but<br/>\n&gt;  found that discussion style too difficult.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  There was a good part of me ready to say that this was the list I<br/>\n&gt;  made, darn it, and that I don&#39;t care if there are 5 people in it or<br/>\n&gt;  50, this is the way it is going to be... but I thought about the<br/>\n&gt;  people on the list and how they really do seem to be wanting to<br/>\n&gt;  unschool and they are wanting be better unschoolers and how they want<br/>\n&gt;  to connect with each other and I let go of the list that I had<br/>\n&gt;  imagined and looked at the one I had.  I wasn&#39;t willing to go along<br/>\n&gt;  with the idea of radically unschooling each other, and I wasn&#39;t very<br/>\n&gt;  interested in saying that we all should try NVC. What I was willing to<br/>\n&gt;  do was to try hard to be gentler in the way that I said things and to<br/>\n&gt;  try to point out that I am pulling the idea out and talking about it<br/>\n&gt;  more generally.  Not going to change what I am saying, just how I am<br/>\n&gt;  saying it. I also asked that people not post about things until they<br/>\n&gt;  are ready to have them critically examined. It is important to me that<br/>\n&gt;  the content isn&#39;t watered down, but on that list where people are<br/>\n&gt;  there to make friends as well as talk about unschooling, I&#39;m trying<br/>\n&gt;  harder to use a style that is more comfortable for people.  It is not<br/>\n&gt;  a comfortable style for me and it takes much longer to write and<br/>\n&gt;  rewrite things, but I think that in this case it could be a more<br/>\n&gt;  effective way of advocating unschooling so I am trying.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  That said, I LOVE that this list is exactly the way that it is.  I<br/>\n&gt;  like that it is clear and direct. I like that there is the idea that<br/>\n&gt;  there are better ways to do things.  I don&#39;t agree with the idea that<br/>\n&gt;  all ideas and ways of doing things are equally good and we are all<br/>\n&gt;  just different and should respect each other and I am glad that this<br/>\n&gt;  is not the way things are here.  I like being able to say what I think<br/>\n&gt;  and it is so much nicer to have someone disagree with me than to have<br/>\n&gt;  them say that it hurt their feelings and to have to address that.  I<br/>\n&gt;  don&#39;t want to talk about how that idea makes someone feel.

What we&#39;re doing here is definitely more and more<br/>\ntowards unschooling.  Brian and I are onboard with many of the same aspects<br/>\nof how radical unschooling works with screen time, and a large variety of<br/>\nother freedoms often not accorded to children.  There are differences that<br/>\nwe run into where one parent is all for more freedom and the other is not,<br/>\nand that&#39;s what I was upset with.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I&#39;m writing this out, I see how unhelpful and even threatening<br/>\nditching unschooling sounds.  Maturity and wisdom would ease some of this<br/>\nstuff, Katherine, ya know?  I chafe at the slow pace sometimes.  It helps to<br/>\nrealize that Karl at 5 has so very much more than so many other kids I know<br/>\nof... in the way of free choice.

So I&#39;m thinking, let&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;&gt; discuss it!-=-<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Christianity has for years had the most effect on homeschoolers who<br/>\n&gt;&gt; aren&#39;t even Christian, in the U.S. anyway. Ten years ago, they were<br/>\n&gt;&gt; being told they created, owned and operated homeschooling. It wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;&gt; true, but it was reported with feeling, and with statistics, and one<br/>\n&gt;&gt; tendency of Christianity is they trust that men of God (however self-<br/>\n&gt;&gt; proclaimed) are telling the truth.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Lately there are another couple of movements (in the US, and maybe<br/>\n&gt;&gt; it&#39;s more widespread) people have jumped into. They too sometimes<br/>\n&gt;&gt; (too often) assume that all other unschoolers are coming from that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; perspective too. One group adopts Marshall Rosenberg&#39;s stuff in a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; religious way and come to consider those don&#39;t want to side up with<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the giraffes or the kangaroos to be heathens (or out of the corner of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; their minds, categorize them as &quot;violent communicators&quot;). The other<br/>\n&gt;&gt; group wants desperately to believe in Ester Hicks and her imaginary<br/>\n&gt;&gt; friend, because if they believe those things they can be rich and happy.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; A little older than that and less harsh in the assumptions is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; formalized paganism.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Waldorf is another set of beliefs that can turn cult-like with some<br/>\n&gt;&gt; people. The best way to get over that one is to read more and more<br/>\n&gt;&gt; about Rudolf Steiner.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From the point of view of people who like the idea of being<br/>\n&gt;&gt; surrounded by powerful spirits and &quot;laws&quot; and who like to feel<br/>\n&gt;&gt; helplessly placed where they are (or worse, powerfully placed where<br/>\n&gt;&gt; they are by pre-birth contracts), humanistic ideas of genetics and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; native intelligence and potential for goodness and plain-old cause<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and effect without cosmic factors probably can seem irritating.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; If unschoolers have other religious or philosophies, that&#39;s probably<br/>\n&gt;&gt; not going to be a problem if their own families can figure out how to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; prioritize the requirements of the situation. If they believe more<br/>\n&gt;&gt; in one than the other, that will help them in their decision making.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; If the two coexist smoothly and easily or they can find a source of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; assistance to tweak their understanding so that they can do both at<br/>\n&gt;&gt; once, great!<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I know there are people on this list with fondness for or deep<br/>\n&gt;&gt; involvement in one or more of those &quot;come and belong to us!&quot; groups.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t think of humanism as a group, but some people do and have<br/>\n&gt;&gt; managed to make a minor counter-religion of it, just as some<br/>\n&gt;&gt; atheists have, with meetings and literature and I guess they have<br/>\n&gt;&gt; picnics and social stuff.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not trying to talk anybody out of their spiritual preferences. I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; just want to say to everyone, as I&#39;ve said to Christians since I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; first started having to defend my own unschooling on the *Prodigy<br/>\n&gt;&gt; user group, that people can homeschool without being Christian.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; People can unschool without having the overlay of another set of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; rules and justifications. Not all homeschoolers are &quot;pro life&quot; or<br/>\n&gt;&gt; vegetarian or believers in a pre-birth waiting room, and it should be<br/>\n&gt;&gt; remembered that not all other unschoolers believe any particular<br/>\n&gt;&gt; thing about politics or diet or spirituality.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Just as unschooling works the same way for all kinds of kids, it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; works the same way within all kinds of side-beliefs (or primary<br/>\n&gt;&gt; beliefs, if that other belief is larger than unschooling in that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; family), if it will work at all.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Unschooling works when the parents are open and energetic and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; creative and love their kids without a set of reasons to suspect them<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and limit them and hold them back. That works not because I said it,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and not because there are laws at work in the universe that draw it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; out to work. It works because of human nature. If people go with<br/>\n&gt;&gt; human nature instead of against it when they&#39;re in the parents-of-<br/>\n&gt;&gt; young-children phases, the results are way bigger than had ever been<br/>\n&gt;&gt; suggested in anything I had read when Kirby was little. I&#39;ve seen<br/>\n&gt;&gt; it in many other families whose kids are young adults now. We<br/>\n&gt;&gt; really, truly are onto something wonderful and it works by itself,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; once you get it working, in normal houses without magic requirements<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and without special equipment.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287815876,"authorName":"Robyn L.

The process has not been smooth, rather lumpy, bumpy and<br/>\ncranky many many times.  And it&#39;s STILL working fine.  You guys can&#39;t see us<br/>\nin real life.  Readers can&#39;t see Karl.

Although they may only be 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon away from them all ;&gt;. Many does not equal a majority. Given that most aren&#39;t in the U.S., many doesn&#39;t even equal any kind of stereotype that Little Britain USA covers. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can remember this fantastic movie called Holy Ghost People that I watched as an undergraduate in anthropology (oh, I love youtube: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=_nX0irC4Bgs,\">http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=_nX0irC4Bgs,</a> love, love youtube!!), that is about the practice of snake handling in some churches in the U.S. as a demonstration of their faith. There are biblical quotes that are cited as evidence that true faith in God will give you protection against serpents and scorpions and against poison. So they test their faith. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy guess is that those Christians have less in common with the Christians that you mention as &quot;most of the Christians that I know&quot;  than the atheist or agnostic unschoolers on this list do. Christian covers a huge range of faith and intensity and cost. I&#39;m not suggesting that your Christian faith is less than the faith of the snake handlers, but I imagine that it is tested in less charismatic and public ways. <br/>\n<br/>\n---------------<br/>\n That&#39;s<br/>\njust another assumption.  I am saddened because while looking for the<br/>\nfreedom so often spoken of in unschooling circles - unfortunately it<br/>\nis freedom as long as you follow along with the groups personal<br/>\nbeliefs.. <br/>\n------------<br/>\n<br/>\nTell me a list where that doesn&#39;t happen. This list is about moving closer to radical unschooling. It isn&#39;t about putting how to maintain faith in a household while supporting individual freedom to choose in a home, although it can be. Ask a question...<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------<br/>\nI am Christian and I don&#39;t look upon my children with undue and extreme<br/>\nsuspicion<br/>\n----------------<br/>\nMy dad is Christian and he is so happy to talk about theology with me. I don&#39;t know a lot, and I can be quite vociferous with my athiesm, but I think he likes a good chat. And I like to tease him when he says &quot;God bless you&quot; when getting off the phone. It must be a habit for him now, it isn&#39;t anything that he&#39;s done more than a couple of times, but I love that accidental viewing of how much his faith has become a defining feature in his life. He doesn&#39;t look upon me with undue and extreme suspicion. Actually, my athiest stepfather probably views me more so. <br/>\n<br/>\n-----------<br/>\n - nor do most of the Christians that I know - and certainly<br/>\nwe are a part of the group labled as &quot;many Christians&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------<br/>\nAh, but does that make you the majority? &#39;Cause Sandra said many and know you are classifying you and yours among many, so how many more for majority? Maybe you are making assumptions that most Christians are like the ones you know. Maybe Sandra, or others, have wider experience. I don&#39;t have a very wide experience. I was raised a Unitarian and now live in a largely secular country. I&#39;ve been excluded from families and groups because I&#39;m not a Christian. I wasn&#39;t allowed to rent a house because of my lack of faith. It was nuns who kept me out. But I&#39;ve also been welcomed by a Priest who christened Simon in a lovely little Episcopalian Church in the South Valley in Albuquerque so that he could wear the gown that had been handed down from parent to child to grandchild  to great grandchild on David&#39;s side of the family. He knew I was an athiest and he was alright with accepting that in my desire to accomodate my in-laws. <br/>\n--------------<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether or not unschooling is a Christian concept depends on how<br/>\ndeeply you install that in your family<br/>\n---------------<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling isn&#39;t a Christian concept. Unschooling is an educational approach that can be extended into other aspects of your life. Unschooling is installed deeply into my family. <br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------<br/>\nPersonally it applies<br/>\nmainly to our education - and we rely on biblical principles to<br/>\ndetermine the rest.  So I don&#39;t feel that anything about our faith<br/>\ninterferes with that.. But it is so difficult to participate on any of<br/>\nthe unschooling lists I belong to because so often when I speak and<br/>\nthere is any hint of my Christian background - I get jumped on .. and<br/>\nI promise you - there is no freedom in that.  <br/>\n----------------------<br/>\nDepending on the lists you are on, not extending unschooling beyond the realm of education may get more of the specifics of your posts questioned than would your faith. Saying that being a Christian is something that comes between you and unschooling may also get you responses from others on the list about faith and unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\n------------------<br/>\nYou guys are so busy<br/>\ntalking about the freedom and respect you give to your kids, but don&#39;t<br/>\nbother giving the same thing to adults.<br/>\n-------------------<br/>\nQuite honestly I&#39;m not on this list to be helped as an adult. And I don&#39;t want my hand held and the small of my back supported as I weep and moan about how difficult something or the other is. I want to hear words about how to move from here to a better life with my children. If I had to spend the time that I volunteer, both to reading and to replying, on lists like this to giving freedom to adults, I would probably spend a lot less time doing it. There are three people in my life who I will bend over backward to support. And I do. The rest of the world gets to take or leave me as I am. And I like to think I&#39;m pretty generous with the rest of the world as well. Just not so bothered with making sure that all their needs are met. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.waynforth.blogspot.com\">http://www.waynforth.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] saddened","postDate":"1222801767","msgId":38949,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgwOTMwMTIwOXUzOWU0NWVhMmszNDU3NzFlZmFiYjE0MmFhQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDg5ODBGMDUyMzAxMzQ4NkZCRDhGNDQwNjI3RTE5MUZEQHdhbGRyb24wbnU4M2Y5Pg==","referencesHeader":"PGdidGxmaSsydmJrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgkgPDg5OEQ0RkQyLTdERTAtNDk1MS1BRDA3LTRCRjhGOTNGNkQ1MEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JIDw4OTgwRjA1MjMwMTM0ODZGQkQ4RjQ0MDYyN0UxOTFGREB3YWxkcm9uMG51ODNmOT4="},"prevInTopic":38947,"nextInTopic":38958,"prevInTime":38948,"nextInTime":38950,"topicId":38867,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"What bothers me about debate there is that some Christians who aren t radical unschoolers want to question the Christianity of those who disagree with them.

You can unsub but it&#39;s fine with me if you don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t hear much of any serious debate from Christians about how to<br/>\nunschool radically.  Debate as in reasoning together, iron sharpening iron.<br/>\nI have read on Christian unschooling lists.  They were valuable to me in a<br/>\nnumber of ways.  But I didn&#39;t feel like rocking the boat on those lists as a<br/>\nguest (though a believer) who felt more radically than some of the members<br/>\nless inclined to unschool radically.  I realized that my religious beliefs<br/>\ncoincide easily with unschooling but that&#39;s not always true for others.  So<br/>\nthere came a point where my beliefs diverge sharply and I don&#39;t have enough<br/>\nin common with the group to make sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe post where I was talking about many Christians applies to probably most<br/>\nof those *I* know.  I feel similarly about the words &quot;discipline&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;disciple&quot; which is not something I attempt to do here in my home.  I<br/>\ninfluence, I debate sometimes too often, I talk things out, but there&#39;s no<br/>\ndiscipline to it.  I am a fellow believer but don&#39;t feel worthy to call<br/>\nmyself a teacher of my religion.  I am working on more accurately modeling<br/>\nthe values I want to change for.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to installing unschooling into my family....

I<br/>\nhave been trying to encourage the idea all round, but not actually taking it<br/>\nand installing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t do halfers.

That&#39;s<br/>\njust another assumption.  I am saddened because while looking for the<br/>\nfreedom so often spoken of in unschooling circles - unfortunately it<br/>\nis freedom as long as you follow along with the groups personal<br/>\nbeliefs.. which is no better than what is accused of home &quot;schooling&quot;<br/>\ngroups.. and it&#39;s not just this unschooling group - but on a majority<br/>\nof the unschooling groups I have joined on yahoo (with the exception<br/>\nof groups in my local area).. (notice I am not throwing out a random<br/>\nlabel out there - I am speaking from PERSONAL EXPERIENCE..) I am<br/>\nChristian and I don&#39;t look upon my children with undue and extreme<br/>\nsuspicion - nor do most of the Christians that I know - and certainly<br/>\nwe are a part of the group labled as &quot;many Christians&quot;..what someone<br/>\nmay perceive from the outside (and having no inside knowlege of our<br/>\nfamily and how we believe and operate) it may LOOK like suspicion, but<br/>\nif you took time to spend with out family it may be something else<br/>\nentirely.. but then you wouldn&#39;t be able to do that with &quot;many&quot;<br/>\nChristians, and then you wouldn&#39;t be able to make baseless assumptions<br/>\neither.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhether or not unschooling is a Christian concept depends on how<br/>\ndeeply you install that in your family - does it just apply to<br/>\neducation, does it extend into your discipline.  Personally it applies<br/>\nmainly to our education - and we rely on biblical principles to<br/>\ndetermine the rest.  So I don&#39;t feel that anything about our faith<br/>\ninterferes with that.. But it is so difficult to participate on any of<br/>\nthe unschooling lists I belong to because so often when I speak and<br/>\nthere is any hint of my Christian background - I get jumped on .. and<br/>\nI promise you - there is no freedom in that.  You guys are so busy<br/>\ntalking about the freedom and respect you give to your kids, but don&#39;t<br/>\nbother giving the same thing to adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can promise you I am doing something I have been contemplating for a<br/>\nwhile - deleting my membership here and all other unschool lists I<br/>\nbelong to.  Other than the Christian ones - because Yes they are<br/>\nnecessary.. so we can discuss openly and not be in fear of being<br/>\nbashed for assumptions people try to make about us as Christians. <br/>\nWhen you have several people (and I have seen it come up several times<br/>\non the lists) talk about being treated poorly for either not having a<br/>\nbelief along the mainstream of the group, or mainly just being<br/>\nChristian - then perhaps instead of laughing about that person&#39;s<br/>\ncomments and being sarcastic - you should consider that PERHAPS you<br/>\nmight indeed be guilty of what you are being accused of. I hope you<br/>\nwill consider that and not turn someone away from the idea of what<br/>\nunschooling is SUPPOSED to be by being rude or curt or making<br/>\nassumptions.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":337544642,"authorName":"carnationsgalore","from":"&quot;carnationsgalore&quot; &lt;addled.homemaker@...&gt;","profile":"carnationsgalore","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: a  small story of summer and fall","postDate":"1222772952","msgId":38924,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdidDFjbytrMWZqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGQ0My4yNTc1YThjNS4zNjExYmFiNkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38903,"nextInTopic":38936,"prevInTime":38923,"nextInTime":38925,"topicId":38867,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

They chatted a bit with us and <br/>\nvoluntarily talked about their lives.  They wanted to have another party here (it&#39;s cool <br/>\nhere!) and I said, &#39;How about a party to celebrate the end of summer, even <br/>\nthough it&#39;s officially fall?&#39;  I told them that it still feels like summer to me <br/>\n- weather, harvest, beautiful days and clear nights (awesome Oregon is what <br/>\nwe have here actually).  Zach says he can tell when summer ends each year <br/>\nbecause then he has HOMEWORK every night  and he hates that.  I wanted to tell him <br/>\nthat right now, Ahren (my oldest and newly 18) was doing his HOMEWORK because <br/>\nhe wanted to, and choose the community college classes he&#39;s taking because he <br/>\nwanted to know more about those topics in a multi-person environment.  BUT I <br/>\nDIDN&#39;T TELL ZACH THAT.  I thought that it might be discouraging and <br/>\ndisheartening.  Yet, next time, I think I will tell him what&#39;s on my mind, just to give <br/>\nhim another way of  thinking about things.  Sharing information and really <br/>\nproviding him another approach to think about.  Not defaming or judging, just <br/>\nletting some energy flow out into his world of a view of another way.<br/>\n <br/>\nGrant, the older one, said his weekends were what he looked forward to, <br/>\notherwise is was pretty hard to bare (bear!) (the 5 day school week).  He seemed to <br/>\nhave a good attitude about it all:  &#39;I can put up with it cause, at least, I <br/>\nhave the weekend&#39;.  I wanted to tell him that our weeks and days are <br/>\nrelatively seamless.  If we&#39;re interested in something, we do it- doesn&#39;t matter if <br/>\nit&#39;s a Tues., Wed. or Fri. or Sun.  We make it happen because we seek it. It <br/>\nseems that Grant&#39;s &#39;can do&#39; space was shrunk to 104 days/year while we get to <br/>\naccess the whole 365 (plus 1/4).  On this beautiful, anything is a wonderful day, <br/>\nI couldn&#39;t reveal this particular information, but I will next time.  <br/>\nInformation can only serve to enlarge a view point <br/>\n <br/>\nTo think of the limits children accept because of their information base.  It <br/>\ndismays and yet, causes thought :).<br/>\n <br/>\nSo for what remains of today and then the promise of tomorrow, mustn&#39;t we all <br/>\ngo forth each day and converse with the children and encourage them and talk <br/>\nof the hope and possibilities of something new and different?
