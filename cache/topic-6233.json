But he &quot;went along&quot; all <br/>\n these years - didn&#39;t really &quot;support.&quot;  He went along because he trusted my <br/>\n judgement, knew that I&#39;d put serious and informed thought into it, knew that <br/>\n I felt strongly and he didn&#39;t. He felt worried and concerned and confused. I <br/>\n tried to allay his fears by letting him in on the reasons I felt strongly <br/>\n about unschooling. And I offered him books or articles to read, but he <br/>\nreally <br/>\n didn&#39;t want to spend his time learning about it, much - he knew he wasn&#39;t <br/>\n going to change my mind anyway. And his fears and anxieties were minor and, <br/>\n over time, were being laid to rest anyway. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis sounds very much like my home.  Dh is a huge supporter of homeschool <br/>\nnow, I hear him talk with people and am very much surprised at what comes out <br/>\nof his mouth considering he was nervous about homeschooling in the first <br/>\nplace.<br/>\nAnd now with unschooling....he&#39;ll be the first to admit it has helped our <br/>\nmarriage, my more relaxed way of living. But he thinks I should be doing a <br/>\nlittle bit of lesson oriented stuff occasionally. <br/>\nHe thinks they should have chore lists etc....pretty normal for the average <br/>\nguy.<br/>\nI think it&#39;s come up twice in the last year, both during stressful weeks, and <br/>\nhe pointed out that the kids weren&#39;t &quot;disciplined&quot; enough which led to a <br/>\nheated discussion because I felt defensive.<br/>\nBut most of the time, he may worry, but he doesn&#39;t say a word.  He knows how <br/>\npassionate I am and has decided it&#39;s better for our family to be supportive.<br/>\nAnd he sees them learning new stuff all the time, I think he is slowly being <br/>\nconvinced.<br/>\nWe haven&#39;t unschooled completely for very long....I am quite sure he will be <br/>\na verbal supporter of unschooling within a few years.<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":689589,"authorName":"KT","from":"KT &lt;Tuck@...&gt;","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Digest Number 316","postDate":"1019133210","msgId":6233,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDQkVCRDFBLjYwMzA1MDNAbWlkc291dGgucnIuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwMTkxMjMzNTUuMzIwNS42MTYzMy5tMTBAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":6240,"prevInTime":6232,"nextInTime":6234,"topicId":6233,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
