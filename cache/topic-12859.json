They want to and<br/>\nthey know how.&quot; - John Holt, author of How Children Learn and many other<br/>\ninspiring books. <br/>\n<br/>\nHolt spent many years teaching, observing, and learning from children, but<br/>\nany parent can see that children are born wanting to grow up to be part of<br/>\nthe adult world. They are so curious and eager that it seems almost<br/>\nimpossible to keep up with their drive to do and learn everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen at some point learning gets separated from the rest of life and turned<br/>\ninto schooling. We are taught that learning means sitting still, doing as<br/>\nyou�re told. Insatiable, passionate learners are turned into bored,<br/>\nrebellious, frightened or passive students. Loving parents become frustrated<br/>\nand burned out teachers. There must be a better way!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe good news is there are lots of parents and children who are growing<br/>\nwithout schooling -- living/learning in their own way, at their own pace,<br/>\nwithout text books, lessons, tests or  coercion. And there are more and more<br/>\nstories of unschooled children who grow up to be happy, confident, competent<br/>\nadults doing meaningful and satisfying work. Ready to give unschooling a<br/>\ntry? Here�s my handy list of reminders for letting go of schooling and<br/>\nenjoying a REAL LIFE:<br/>\n<br/>\nR - Relax. It sounds easy, but it takes practice. Being a parent may just be<br/>\nthe most difficult challenge of our lives. When you start to feel stress<br/>\ncoming on, take a breath, take a hike, take up knitting or square dancing or<br/>\nscuba diving. Take it one day (or one moment) at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nE - Enjoy. The challenges of parenting are great and the rewards are even<br/>\ngreater. The years go by so quickly -- embrace each stage and welcome the<br/>\nchanges. If you take pictures, write a journal or make a scrapbook, you can<br/>\nenjoy it again when the children are grown and the house is quiet and<br/>\norderly.<br/>\n<br/>\nA - Accept and acknowledge the absolutely amazing, awesome and authentic<br/>\nindividual who&#39;s sharing your life. Allow him to &quot;be how he grows&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nL - Love is the greatest gift. Giving is receiving.<br/>\n<br/>\nL - Learn from and learn with your children. Learn to play, learn a new<br/>\nskill, learn about yourself. Watch how your children learn. Living is<br/>\nlearning. Teaching is unnecessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nI - Investigate intriguing ideas. Help your children follow their interests.<br/>\nOne thing leads to another and the infinite universe is interconnected --<br/>\nyou can start anywhere. It�s impossible to predict exactly which skills or<br/>\nknowledge will be needed in ten or twenty years.<br/>\n<br/>\nF - Fearlessly forgive and forget. Schooling taught us to be fearful;<br/>\nunschooling encourages us to be brave. We all make mistakes. Forgive<br/>\nyourself and forge ahead. &quot;Forget everything you learned in school.&quot; Did<br/>\nyour first boss tell you that? It�s still good advice. Have fun. Have<br/>\nfaith. <br/>\n<br/>\nE - Expect miracles. Encourage and enable exploration. Eschew ersatz<br/>\neducational edicts. Embody the traits you wish to pass on.  Empower your<br/>\nchildren (and yourself) to experiment, to engage in a life worth living and<br/>\nwork worth doing. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

My chiropractor, whom I&#39;m seeing a <br/>\nlot of these days, has four darling children. The oldest is a boy, <br/>\nnine, and I just met him. I only spent about 5 minutes with him, but he <br/>\nstruck me as such an intense, intelligent child. He seems weighted down <br/>\nby the world, though, and has a stutter. I mentioned homeschooling to <br/>\nthe chiro, but he didn&#39;t seem too interested.

I wanted to share.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nR-E-A-L - L-I-F-E<br/>\nLuz Shosie<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Children do not need to be made to learn, or shown how. They want to and<br/>\nthey know how.&quot; - John Holt, author of How Children Learn and many other<br/>\ninspiring books. <br/>\n<br/>\nHolt spent many years teaching, observing, and learning from children, but<br/>\nany parent can see that children are born wanting to grow up to be part of<br/>\nthe adult world. They are so curious and eager that it seems almost<br/>\nimpossible to keep up with their drive to do and learn everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen at some point learning gets separated from the rest of life and turned<br/>\ninto schooling. We are taught that learning means sitting still, doing as<br/>\nyou¹re told. Insatiable, passionate learners are turned into bored,<br/>\nrebellious, frightened or passive students. Loving parents become frustrated<br/>\nand burned out teachers. There must be a better way!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe good news is there are lots of parents and children who are growing<br/>\nwithout schooling -- living/learning in their own way, at their own pace,<br/>\nwithout text books, lessons, tests or  coercion. And there are more and more<br/>\nstories of unschooled children who grow up to be happy, confident, competent<br/>\nadults doing meaningful and satisfying work. Ready to give unschooling a<br/>\ntry? Here¹s my handy list of reminders for letting go of schooling and<br/>\nenjoying a REAL LIFE:<br/>\n<br/>\nR - Relax. It sounds easy, but it takes practice. Being a parent may just be<br/>\nthe most difficult challenge of our lives. When you start to feel stress<br/>\ncoming on, take a breath, take a hike, take up knitting or square dancing or<br/>\nscuba diving. Take it one day (or one moment) at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nE - Enjoy. The challenges of parenting are great and the rewards are even<br/>\ngreater. The years go by so quickly -- embrace each stage and welcome the<br/>\nchanges. If you take pictures, write a journal or make a scrapbook, you can<br/>\nenjoy it again when the children are grown and the house is quiet and<br/>\norderly.<br/>\n<br/>\nA - Accept and acknowledge the absolutely amazing, awesome and authentic<br/>\nindividual who&#39;s sharing your life. Allow him to &quot;be how he grows&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nL - Love is the greatest gift. Giving is receiving.<br/>\n<br/>\nL - Learn from and learn with your children. Learn to play, learn a new<br/>\nskill, learn about yourself. Watch how your children learn. Living is<br/>\nlearning. Teaching is unnecessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nI - Investigate intriguing ideas. Help your children follow their interests.<br/>\nOne thing leads to another and the infinite universe is interconnected --<br/>\nyou can start anywhere. It¹s impossible to predict exactly which skills or<br/>\nknowledge will be needed in ten or twenty years.<br/>\n<br/>\nF - Fearlessly forgive and forget. Schooling taught us to be fearful;<br/>\nunschooling encourages us to be brave. We all make mistakes. Forgive<br/>\nyourself and forge ahead. &quot;Forget everything you learned in school.&quot; Did<br/>\nyour first boss tell you that? It¹s still good advice. Have fun. Have<br/>\nfaith. <br/>\n<br/>\nE - Expect miracles. Encourage and enable exploration. Eschew ersatz<br/>\neducational edicts. Embody the traits you wish to pass on.  Empower your<br/>\nchildren (and yourself) to experiment, to engage in a life worth living and<br/>\nwork worth doing.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12969,"nextTopicId":12968}}
