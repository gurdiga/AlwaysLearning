She only wants<br/>\nto go to school to meet more friends and have fun.<br/>\nSince I signed her up she has changed her mind a couple times. She seems<br/>\nto be sticking with the not going choice again.<br/>\nI was bummed that she would consider going but decided to let her. I was<br/>\neven more bummed when I asked for words of wisdom from the unschoolers I<br/>\nconsider so wise and got nothing. <br/>\nI found a book at the library I thought I could get my daughter to read<br/>\nbecause I know she is struggling with this choice now. <br/>\nI ended up reading it myself. I now feel better and can hopefully deal<br/>\nwith her going to school if she chooses to go again.<br/>\nMy daughter began reading it but isn&#39;t as thrilled with it as I was. She<br/>\nhasn&#39;t gotten through the first chapter yet so I&#39;ll have to wait to see<br/>\nif she&#39;s going to get as much out of it as I have. <br/>\nMaybe you&#39;ve read it; if not, maybe you should think about it. <br/>\n<br/>\nA Sense of Self : Listening to Homeschooled Adolescent Girls<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://halleducation.com/education/1037.shtml\">http://halleducation.com/education/1037.shtml</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSharon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Tamzin is going to school in September.
