It is only when I realized there WAS a pattern of repeated <br/>\nuse of coercion was I able to see how ingrained and abusive that was. <br/>\nThe fact that I believed that I had to or was made to do things was <br/>\nassumed. I didn&#39;t question it within the relationship with my <br/>\nparents. They loved me. So it must be me, not the process of relating <br/>\nthat was dysfunctional.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne has to be able to see that it is not the events of coercion that <br/>\nis the issue so much as the PATTERN of forcing someone do something <br/>\nthat they do not want to do. As Sandra said coercion stays the same. <br/>\n<br/>\nAbuse is when there is no recourse to avoid the coercion over time. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck. Personally, I realized that each of my parents actually <br/>\nhad different roles in the coercive relationship. My father has been <br/>\nunable to see that I perceive his behavior to still be coercive. He <br/>\nbelieves that I have responsibilities and obligations to him and his <br/>\nexpectations. Not choices. Fortunately, he can no longer force me to <br/>\ncomply. We no longer have an abusive relationship. Sometimes all you <br/>\ncan do is leave the abusive relationship if it won&#39;t change. It is <br/>\nvery empowering to leave an abusive relationship. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can celebrate that my son can retain his self-determination and <br/>\nself-value since he won&#39;t be in a relationship with a pattern of <br/>\ncoercion with his parents.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, badolbilz &lt;ynxn96@f...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; This is a very timely topic for me.
