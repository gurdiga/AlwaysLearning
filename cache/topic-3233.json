Please passionate advocates of the TV, say something!<br/>\n[AlwaysLearning] TV, Video and unschooling<br/>\nDate: Mon, Jan 28, 2002, 2:33 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m being the devil&#39;s advocate, now.. I actually am giving serious thought<br/>\nto that &quot;letting them form their own opinions&quot; business, it&#39;s just that I<br/>\nthink it&#39;s just as important to discuss how to transfer your values to<br/>\nyour children... does anyone seriously think it&#39;s not desireable? or just<br/>\nnot possible? or what? You actually can&#39;t help transferring at least some<br/>\nvalues, so why not to do more of it, or should everyone conscientiously<br/>\ntry to do less of it?<br/>\n--------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t a matter of &quot;letting them form their own opinions&quot;. You cannot stop<br/>\nthem from doing so. You may be able, for awhile at least, to keep them from<br/>\nvoicing those opinions. You may be able to even get them to lie to you and<br/>\nsay they agree with your opinions if they don&#39;t. But you have little power<br/>\nover their actual opinions now, and will have less as time goes on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as transferring values goes, well, frankly, I&#39;m not interested in<br/>\ntransferring. It would make me sad if a child of mine grew up to believe<br/>\nthat Pit Bulls were evil and that PETA was on to something, but I&#39;d get over<br/>\nit. My children are human beings who WILL have some values divergent from<br/>\nmine, and perhaps important-to-me ones at that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am trying to live my values. In this way, my children will be able to see<br/>\nwhat I believe by the actions I take, and whether I do as I say. This is<br/>\nwhat forms their opinion of me. Whether my values make sense to them is what<br/>\nwill make them decide whether to adopt those values or go another direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a bit like Christianity. Some Christians simply go about their lives<br/>\nliving as they think Jesus would have tried to, making choices the best they<br/>\ncan based on a moral framework they&#39;ve adopted. Some Christians, OTOH, go<br/>\naround telling everyone they&#39;re going to hell.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know which kind of Christian I&#39;d rather be, and I don&#39;t appreciate the<br/>\nlatter variety trying to transfer their values at me.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3390,"nextTopicId":3421}}
