I thought I didn&#39;t have a choice but to be the default if they didn&#39;t want to do what he was doing....  and I didn&#39;t believe him when he said that he would play with them when they are older and can &#39;do&#39; stuff....  in retrospect, I see that I took on much more than needed....<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that my kids are 9, 11, and 13yo, it&#39;s a whole different ballgame... he takes them skiing... plays football with them...takes them shopping... gets to their sporting events... he does a lot with them...  AND my kids are really into the NFL and fantasy football with him....  they try to watch every football game together.... and talk during the week about who retired and who moved from team to team.....  they all are also into cars together.... and they watched every episode of &#39;Friends&#39; together.... and then played a trivia game about it....<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I wonder if the kids have taken on his interests bec. it&#39;s how they can connect with him but I see evidence to the contrary.... they are excitede about football and cars.... (2 boys and a girl)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough it could be said that it is a function of his having the kids every other weekend but I don&#39;t think so, I think he simply REALLY enjoys the kids at THESE ages more than when they were younger.....  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not to say that they are busy bees all the time over there.... my kids come home knowing a LOT about music videos and the new bands which is not something their dad would do with them!    (I don&#39;t have cable tv here)  I appreciate that they can pursue their interests over there too....<br/>\n<br/>\nI see them as having a healthy respect for each other&#39;s interests.... they know what their dad is into and he knows what they are into.... and they support each other....<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, my middle son (11yo) will be sad that his dad travels so much for work.... my mantra is that he gets to decide what he is going to do and you get to decide how you&#39;re going to handle it.... sad to be missing him?  grateful that he makes a good living for the fun things you are all able to do together?  grateful that when he is in town, he makes an effort to take you to racquetball?  happy that he has a job that he enjoys and grateful that you have a life that you enjoy?   I also encourage him to talk to his dad about wanting to see him more... much better than me going to dad on his behalf....<br/>\n<br/>\n I mention that bec. the relationship btn your son and his dad is THEIR relationship.... you can support your son in talking to his dad about what he&#39;d like but it is still their relationship....  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd perhaps the conversation to have with dh is not about his time with his son but &#39;support&#39; for your time to not be interrupted... yes, you could leave the house but I feel it is nice to have time at home and have someone else respond to the children so that I can have quiet time to myself....  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd a last thing... it could be a nice memory for your son that they watched tv together in the evening... perhaps in a few years, evenings will be hectic and he&#39;ll look back to those quiet evenings where they watched CSI together or whatever... and your son will grow up to be on those quiz shows and know all the answers to the questions about sitcoms of his childhood....   who knows?!  <br/>\n<br/>\ngood luck...<br/>\nJane<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Daddy doesn&#39;t play,is that okay?","postDate":"1204884803","msgId":32806,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM3QzQ3MTU4LTE1NDAtNEYxNC05M0EwLUYyREM0OEJEQjk1M0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGZxcGhnbCtrYTZmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZxcGhnbCtrYTZmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":32791,"nextInTopic":32810,"prevInTime":32805,"nextInTime":32807,"topicId":32773,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
