I am so happy that I found<br/>\nthis group and Sandra&#39;s website! I can&#39;t wait until I have time to<br/>\nread through everything. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also found a group of unschoolers in my area who meet for a park<br/>\nday, so that should be a good start to making new friends and learning<br/>\nnew things. I really like the ideas about having a one-liner handy, I<br/>\nwill have to think one up. I have so much to learn, but I think we are<br/>\ndoing okay so far. My husband and I have great ideas about how to make<br/>\nthings accessible to our children. My husband does graphic design, so<br/>\nwe have been designing this artwork for the kids rooms formed by<br/>\nletters of the English alphabet, and when we are through with that we<br/>\nare going to do letters of the greek alphabet. I&#39;m really excited<br/>\nabout that project! <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the best example of hostility towards unschooling and the<br/>\nreason why I am resolving to unschool would be from a good friend of<br/>\nours. She is a teacher at a local charter school that works with<br/>\nhomeschooling families. I had always looked up to her as this great<br/>\nbastion of knowledge and read all the books that she told me to read<br/>\nabout learning. These included &quot;The Well Trained Mind&quot; and &quot;Reading in<br/>\n100 Easy Lessons.&quot; I was all set to start Karlos (3.75) on the lessons<br/>\nat aged 3, but then John Holt&#39;s books gave me pause and I decided to<br/>\nunschool instead. When I stated my intention to said friend, she<br/>\nlooked at me like I was crazy. I thought she of all people would be<br/>\nsupportive, but instead she told me about how all of the unschooling<br/>\nfamilies she knows are so far behind in school and she thought that<br/>\nwas ridiculous. This was told to me after she had just finished<br/>\ntalking to one of our friend&#39;s children who is in her charter school.<br/>\nThe conversation went as follows with A being the teacher and E the child.<br/>\n<br/>\nE- can I show you my math lesson I did today?<br/>\nA- Sure, let me see what you&#39;ve got.<br/>\nE proceeds to open math curriculum booklet which he has just begun<br/>\nA- No, you opened it to that back, that&#39;s the hard stuff, we&#39;ll get to<br/>\nthat eventually, show me the front where you are.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think when E gets to the back of the book that he will have a<br/>\ndefeatist attitude or not? After all, that&#39;s the &quot;hard stuff.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all so much for reminding me that we are making the right<br/>\nchoice and to not worry about what others think or say. It has really<br/>\nmeant a lot.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re:New Unschooler in a hostile environment (Kimbrah...)","postDate":"1177535158","msgId":28481,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM1NzExNEY3LTMxMEYtNEI2MS1CQjVDLTY0NUIyNUNBRjkxRkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMTQwMWM3ODc3NiQxODc5NDU4MCQ2NzAxYThjMEBTdGFjeUxhcHRvcD4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwMTQwMWM3ODc3NiQxODc5NDU4MCQ2NzAxYThjMEBTdGFjeUxhcHRvcD4="},"prevInTopic":28480,"nextInTopic":28482,"prevInTime":28480,"nextInTime":28482,"topicId":28480,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- Be patient, educate others.
