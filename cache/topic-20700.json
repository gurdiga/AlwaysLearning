But the kids made excuses to come in <br/>\nand then took food and left, usually proclaiming they wanted to play <br/>\nwith ds but usually just wanting a snack and leaving as soon as they <br/>\nsecured one - imagine how that made my son feel!

I&#39;m not sure if they cought on to <br/>\nthat or the fact that they&#39;re now back in school but they haven&#39;t <br/>\nbeen over in about 2 weeks. Anyhow as much as I would love to be <br/>\nable to make these kids understand some things I can&#39;t because <br/>\nthey&#39;re not interested in learning them! And they get this not <br/>\nwillingness to understand things from their parents because I have <br/>\ntalked to them as well! Anyhow I am going to try and just find more <br/>\nlike - minded parents and their kids for my child to play with, to <br/>\nbe our community, but frankly it&#39;s definately not easy! However I&#39;m <br/>\nnot going to stop trying to &quot;educate&quot; my neighbors about the child-<br/>\nled mentality either, perhaps some may catch on, but until then I am <br/>\ngoing to have my guard up to protect my child! I should also say I <br/>\nwill be there for my child when he gets hurt because as much as I <br/>\nwant to protect him, I know when he asks to go to the neighbors and <br/>\neven though I&#39;ve explained to him why it may not be the best <br/>\ndecision, I know he may decide to go and find for himself and <br/>\nbecause I trust him I will let him. <br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Elizabeth Hill <br/>\n&lt;ecsamhill@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So could you help me now <br/>\n&gt; with some ideas on what to say when my kid wants to go next door? <br/>\n </span></blockquote>**<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; If the neighboring parents are crabby, inviting their kid(s) over <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to your house is usually a more attractive choice.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Betsy </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1160699,"authorName":"Penn Acres","from":"&quot;Penn Acres&quot; &lt;pennacres@...&gt;","profile":"ravenstree2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Community education","postDate":"1095050412","msgId":20739,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNTcwMWM0OTk0YiRmMDZkMmMyMCQyMWUwYjVkMEBQZW5ubz4=","referencesHeader":"PGQ4LjE0NjcxYmVkLjJlNzYxZmE0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":20738,"nextInTopic":20740,"prevInTime":20738,"nextInTime":20740,"topicId":20700,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"You said  For me, my purpose  in life is to treat my kids as well as I can, (and I  fail lots of  times,)   -  this is a good purpose but what  happens  when","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2002578596\">You said  &quot;For me, my purpose  in life is to treat my kids as well <br/>\nas I can, (and I  fail lots of  times,)&quot;   -  this is a good purpose <br/>\nbut what  happens  when the kid grow up?

All our kids probably<br/>\nget those &quot;why aren&#39;t you in school&quot; questions.   It gets easier.  After<br/>\nawhile more people will know you and fewer will ask.  After awhile you&#39;ll<br/>\ncare less what other people are thinking and saying. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour son is very young.  Instead of worrying about his education try<br/>\nthinking about today.  How is he today?  <br/>\nWhat can you do with him today that he would like?   If your goal is a<br/>\nhappy today you&#39;ll find facing each day easier. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your neighbors aren&#39;t particularly nice you don&#39;t have to spend time<br/>\nwith them.   If you know the lady at the corner store *is* nice, stop in<br/>\nthere and say hello when you&#39;re going by.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in a small town.  There are a few homeschoolers here but they<br/>\nstay inside during school hours.   The result of that is that most of the<br/>\npeople in the community don&#39;t know they know many homeschoolers.  But<br/>\nthey know us. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe people at the grocery store know Dylan by name and know he doesn&#39;t go<br/>\nto school.  There are no more questions from them about why he&#39;s not is<br/>\nschool or what he&#39;s studying.   The people at the library, video store,<br/>\nvariety store, antique store post office, book shop, coffee house and<br/>\ngreen house know he doesn&#39;t go to school.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he goes into the library our Librarian talks to him the way she<br/>\ntalks to everyone.  She tells him about new books by authors he likes. <br/>\nShe informs him when there are new books about WWII.   She shows him new<br/>\njazz cd&#39;s or new graphic novels.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he goes to the book shop they let him into the back room to snoop<br/>\nthrough the used science fiction books they don&#39;t have room for out<br/>\nfront.  The set aside any old Peanuts books they come across and check to<br/>\nsee if he wants them.
