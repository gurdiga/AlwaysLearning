I think I’ll ask her to change the wording of the “peaceful parenting” statement so it’s not so much a definition. I didn’t want Katy’s and my picture on the blog that’s why she chose to use a stock photo. The doll pictures are real though. I’m glad the article passed muster. It was really to hard to get the idea of unschooling across in such a short piece.  My editor cut out a lot.  This group has helped me so much.

I hesitated because I don&#39;t really like to make a big deal about unschooling as it is so easily misunderstood and it&#39;s always a bit unnerving going public with our life style. But I decided to do it because I thought the readers of this particular blog would be more amenable to the ideas expressed and also because I wanted my friend to know about this option since she has an autistic child and has gone through the mill with the public school system. I had never heard about unschooling before I started homeschooling my daughter 3 years ago. Sandra&#39;s and Joyce&#39;s websites made such a huge difference in my life. I thought I&#39;d take a risk and come out of the closet about my way of homeschooling in hopes it might help someone else. Below is a link the article if you are interested in reading about my experience. I do hope I&#39;ve expressed  the philosophy of unschooling fairly and presented it in a realistic way. It was hard to do in such a short article which was supposed to be upbeat and to the point. I&#39;d welcome your comments. (PS the pictures in the article are not of me and my daughter - they&#39;re stock photos). <br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://yogabright.com/exclusive-articles/\">http://yogabright.com/exclusive-articles/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66833,"nextTopicId":66894}}
