I buy as much fruit and veggies as I can, I make as many goodies as I can, things like zucchini bread and pancakes.  Mostly I feel like we always have enough.  There are a few times when I get down about not having MY special food items (I have a lot of food allergies that a food bank wouldn&#39;t accommodate), and then my husband will pull out a hidden $20 and give it to me, because he&#39;s sweet and generous.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are ways of being resourceful and feeling bountiful.

My son also has multiple food sensitivity issues, and buying all allergen free foods (mostly unprocessed whole foods) *can* be expensive.  That is why I really cook everything from scratch, and buy almost everything at the farmer&#39;s market (soooo much cheaper where I live) which does save a lot of money, but also takes a LOT of planning, and creativity, (and time!)  I work from home doing childcare for another family while taking care of my son which allows me the time to put into making most of our own food.  It&#39;s a real balancing act, but making sure my son can get those things he really wants when he wants them is important to me.  And I&#39;ve found ways to be frugal in many areas (living in a small apt, sharing our 1 used car w/ my dh, etc.) so that the things that matter most to us (food esp.) are affordable, and even abundant in our home.  (I realize we each figure out what is most important for our families and make these kind of choices every day, food is just sooooo important to me that I find a way to get us all whatever we need when we need it...and not always in an expensive manner--The past 2 nights I&#39;ve made &#39;ice cream&#39; out of a frozen banana and a small amount of canned coconut milk since I don&#39;t have the ingredients to make it from scratch in the manner I usually do or have the $ to buy it pre-made at the store...ds has been wanting ice cream though and this has worked for him. ;) <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could involve the kids in helping make more food (including baked goods) at home from scratch?  Picking up pies at the store is probably a lot more expensive than making your own small pies at home.  And pies (esp. homemade) can be filled with really protein, nutrient rich ingredients (this was talked about b/4)--eggs, milk, and sometimes a nut based crust could make it a really protein rich, nourishing thing to eat!<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck mama--I realize it can be very overwhelming to try and meet needs when you feel like you are struggling financially--I&#39;ve felt stresses I never had b/4 living with a lot less money, but with some creativity and planning, I feel it is possible to make sure everyone gets what they need...<br/>\n<br/>\nHTH!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: New with question","postDate":"1254320734","msgId":47707,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFERUM0RDE0LUE1RUItNDU5Ni05QkMwLUJBQkNBMDRGMDk5QkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGg5dm1vNStwdGxpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGg5dm1vNStwdGxpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47706,"nextInTopic":47711,"prevInTime":47706,"nextInTime":47708,"topicId":47616,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-i don t MAKE THEM eat the cakes..they can have something else..problem is, we usually don t have much. my dh was like, cake for breakfast??? yes, it has","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1808227759\">-=-i don&#39;t MAKE THEM eat the cakes..they can have something  <br/>\nelse..problem is, we usually don&#39;t have much. my dh was like, &#39;cake  <br/>\nfor breakfast???&#39;<br/>\nyes, it has the same sugar as donuts. so it&#39;s not a big deal.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there isn&#39;t much else, then it&#39;s not a choice.

If I were to say to my 2.5 yo, &quot;No, sorry, cake is gone--you can&#39;t have any cake, it&#39;s not an option&quot;, he would most likely get very upset as well.  So, I try to work on ways to help him meet his needs, and to validate what he wants, and problem solve with him.  Doing these kind of things, I find it much easier to just *avoid* &#39;fits&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this situation, I might say: &quot;You want more chocolate cake?  Oh, we ate all the chocolate cake yesterday?  Hmmm--should we get some at the store today?  Let&#39;s write it on the list (drawing a pic of cake on a &#39;list&#39;)&quot;  (Sometimes this is all he needs--to know I will get more if he wants it, and then I make SURE to buy more the next time we go to the store.  He *trusts*, from past experience, that I will help him get what he wants.)  Or, if he wanted it right then, I might say &quot;Should we make a chocolate cake?  Let&#39;s see if we have the ingredients&quot; etc., and work on ways to make it for him.  (I usually try to keep some of his favorite baked goods in individual serving sizes in the freezer--cupcakes, cookies, etc.--so that this isn&#39;t as much of an issue.  I try to make sure to make more of his faves before the last servings run out, but I have been known to bake a batch of cookies at 10 pm when he wants them!  We are night owls around here.  The good thing about baking cake or cookies is that I&#39;m usually always in the mood to have some too! ;)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI find life feels smoothest and easiest and happiest when I try to look at the situation at hand, in the moment (my son wants cake and there isn&#39;t any left--how can I help him get what he wants) vs. over-moralizing of what&#39;s happening (something I think adults are prone to do) as in thinking &quot;Why does he act like this, what did I do wrong, will he always be like this, etc...&quot;  Finding ways to say, &quot;yes&quot; when our first impulse might be to say &quot;sorry, no&quot;, has been very helpful for me.  And b/c my son KNOWS I&#39;m his partner (from our past experiences together), that I&#39;m going to try to help him get what he wants and needs, he really seems pretty flexible and understanding if I need him to wait or ask him if an alternative will work for him (ie, Oh, we ate all the cake--do you want ice cream instead?, etc.)  I think it takes time and a lot of &quot;yes&quot; on our part as parents to build this trust though...<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!

Quite often what someone needs -- this is  <br/>\ntrue of adults too! -- is someone to understand how upsetting being  <br/>\ndisappointed it. Sometimes people just need to grieve for a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] New with question","postDate":"1253978337","msgId":47620,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRBQkUzMEUxLjUwNTA3QG1hYy5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGg5bDZnaCtoYjRjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGg5bDZnaCtoYjRjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47619,"nextInTopic":47621,"prevInTime":47619,"nextInTime":47621,"topicId":47616,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"She s two.

And your two yo <br/>\nstill seems to have these times when he/she is so angry, frustrated, <br/>\nunhappy -- so you ride those times out as sweetly and gently as you can. <br/>\nDon&#39;t lose YOUR cool - be sympathetic, kind, but calm and <br/>\nmatter-of-fact. &quot;Sorry, no cake today, sweetie.&quot; Just simple clear <br/>\nstatements. Giving options helps her feel more in control, but sometimes <br/>\ntoo many options can be overwhelming and cause stress and meltdowns - <br/>\ntry offering just two options at a time, see if that helps. &quot;We have <br/>\nlittle pies or peanut butter toast.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a little child is having a meltdown, it is really good for the <br/>\nparent to remain calm and okay and soothing - helps the child not feel <br/>\nas crazy out of control.

The child isn&#39;t being manipulative or mean <br/>\nor disrespectful - the child is &quot;losing it&quot; because his/her brain isn&#39;t <br/>\nfully functional yet - there is development going on in the brain that <br/>\nis typical for that stage of life, but it also is making it difficult <br/>\nfor the child to handle certain kinds of situations.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 9/26/2009 6:55 AM, cosmbo wrote:<br/>\n&gt; is this the age? where did i go wrong with her? i know kids (older) that were unschooled and they are very respectable.  is this just the age?  how do i handle the fits?  i mean..she goes into such a fit, and gets so riled up she doesn&#39;t even remember why she&#39;s pitching the fit..  if you try to talk to her, she&#39;ll just keep screaming the same thing, &#39;i want ____, I want_____.

None is protein.  When my daughter, Holly, melted down at that age (or still; or me, pretty much too) what was needed was protein.  She needed scrambled eggs, or a tuna sandwich, or cheese and nuts.    Then when she wasn&#39;t protein-deprived she could calm down and be nice.  It might take a while, and if you always wait until a fit to remember to provide protein, there will always be fits.  You might go weeks without a fit if you keep protein available.
