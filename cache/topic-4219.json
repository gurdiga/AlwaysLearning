If persuasions a sin there, maybe it&#39;s just because <br/>\n&gt;they&#39;re not good at persuasion.  I don&#39;t know.  I think it&#39;s a great tool in <br/>\n&gt;life in general, and if nobody&#39;s feeling tricked or duped or embarrassed when <br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s over, then it was free will exercise.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What I lack in persuasive skills, I make up in persistence!<br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\nWith kids, you were just stating some facts.  If I say &quot;The mess in the den <br/>\nis really getting to me.  Could you guys at least get your own stuff out?  <br/>\nAnd I need help with laundry folding.&quot; I&#39;m wanting them to do something.  <br/>\nLots of things.   I&#39;m just not saying &quot;Anything still in here in an hour is <br/>\ntrash&quot; or &quot;Marty YOU clean it all up, because you&#39;ve been the least helpful <br/>\nlately.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Sandra, you were talking about angst you expressed when Kirby was younger.  <br/>\nCould this have been why Kirby is a better reader?  Are there any negative <br/>\nside affects from displaying your angst?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t display it much, I just let it make my stomach acid dance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were two and a half reading lessons when Kirby was seven (six or <br/>\nseven).  Horrible.  I would love to take those back.  I was afraid of his <br/>\ngrandma.  Everybody is.  If he had read at two on national TV she wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nhave been happy.  I just hadn&#39;t figured that out, quite, in those days.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still aware of some thing, like my kids don&#39;t have good handwriting, but <br/>\nhaving taught jr. high I remember kids who&#39;d been in school for nine or ten <br/>\nyears who didn&#39;t have either.   The difference is my kids haven&#39;t been made <br/>\nto rewrite boring homework, or gotten bad grades in penmanship, or points <br/>\ntaken off a grade because they wrote something illegibly, or shamed or <br/>\nlaughed at in front of 30 people repeatedly for years.   They&#39;re happy guys <br/>\nwhose writing&#39;s bad, instead of shamed to the core guys whose writing&#39;s bad.  <br/>\n  Kirby&#39;s is starting to show some improvement.  He wants to take driver&#39;s <br/>\ned, and he&#39;s learning to cook.  He wrote down a recipe the other day.  Nobody <br/>\nmade him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      Yahoo!
