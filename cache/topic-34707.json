If your son belives that telling you about dangerous play","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1250528579\">If your principle is to keep your son safe it is important to keep the lines of communication open. If your son belives that telling you about dangerous play or r rated movies will result in him being not allowed to play with his bestest friend, I am guessing he&#39;ll stop talking about those things with you. And that seems really unsafe to me. I would really work to try and come up with ways that they can play together. Rather than making it bad or wrong that they accidently watched a scary R-rated movie, commiserate. Depending on the movie see if you can find some making of stuff about the movie and watch some completely removed from fear sort of moments that dissect the movie. Help him to feel strong enough in that relationship to say no if he doesn&#39;t want to watch a movie, or no to playing with nunchuks. Make coming over to your house really fun. Linnaea has a friend at whose house I&#39;m reticent to have her spend the night. Not actually because of<br/>\n tension between Linnaea and her friend, but because Linnaea and her friend&#39;s older sister have come to near blows. And I know that the parents aren&#39;t that responsive, they don&#39;t move fast for a fight. If Linnaea wanted to spend the night, I would let her, but she knows what my reservations are, and she, at this point, agrees and is fine with being the hostess to sleepovers. Her friend actually prefers to spend the night here, as well, so there isn&#39;t a conflict of desires going on and no one feels that this is a punitive action on my part. <br/>\n<br/>\nLinnaea has been the younger friend in a few relationships and she had boundaries pushed probably more than if she had been with a child of her own age. I don&#39;t have a problem with that, but it is an aspect of having different aged friends. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n==================<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first was that the boy has asked repeatedly if my son can watch <br/>\nvery scary movies like The Hills Have Eyes or play video games like <br/>\nGrand Theft Auto. I don&#39;t necessarily have anything against these <br/>\nmoveis and videos. However, I don&#39;t want my son being exposed to <br/>\nthese things at someone else&#39;s house when I&#39;m not there to judge his <br/>\nreaction, discuss things with him, etc. So, I&#39;ve asked the other boy <br/>\nnot to watch/play those video games while my ds is there. My ds has <br/>\nnot expressed any desire to watch those movies or the play the video <br/>\ngames. It was all the other boys suggestion. He said he would not <br/>\nbut I later found out they &quot;accidentally&quot; put in a R-rated movie <br/>\nthat scared my ds a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second (and last straw) happened the last time my ds was over <br/>\nthere. He came (not upset) and at some point while telling me about <br/>\nwhat they were doing over there said the other boy hurt him. I asked <br/>\nwhat happened and was told the other boy purposely choked my ds with <br/>\nnunchuks and my ds couldn&#39;t breathe and it hurt. I asked if the <br/>\nadult there did anything. My ds said, &quot;No. She wasn&#39;t there.&quot; I <br/>\nthink she was in the living room and the boys were in the bedroom <br/>\nand she probably didn&#39;t know what was going on. That&#39;s when I told <br/>\nmy son that he could not play inside that other boy&#39;s house anymore <br/>\nbecause I didn&#39;t think it was safe. As soon as I told my son then he <br/>\nstarted to backtrack and say it didn&#39;t hurt him and it wasn&#39;t a big <br/>\ndeal and the other boy only did it for a second. The next day my son <br/>\nalso told me the other boy has a game he plays that is secret so my <br/>\nson is not allowed to tell anyone else about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my son was invited over again and I said he couldn&#39;t go, my son <br/>\nwas very angry with me. He cried and screamed and said I made his <br/>\nfriend go away. I carried my son inside and sat with him on the <br/>\ncouch while he cried and then we watched some TV and sat together <br/>\nafter he calmed down a bit. He periodically got upset all over again <br/>\nand I would hold him (if he let me) and tell him again why I didn&#39;t <br/>\nthink it was safe.

It looked potentially dangerous, so she <br/>\nhad a long distance conversation with him (yelled) about the &quot;consequences&quot; of falling.  It <br/>\nwas his decision, and if he chose to do what she clearly thought he shouldn&#39;t do, he would <br/>\nsuffer the consequences.  That was it--no support, no offer to hold a hand or to spot <br/>\nhim--just making sure he &quot;understood the consequences&quot; of his decision.

Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Have you by any chance said you love him completely no matter what <br/>\n </span></blockquote>he does?  I hate it when parents do that, seriously. It&#39;s buying <br/>\ntrouble and it&#39;s dishonest, or should be.  <br/>\n<br/>\n------------<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you convey that without it feeling like a threat?<br/>\n<br/>\n------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Would he have any interest in taking a karate class?  Not a street- <br/>\n&gt; fighting kind of martial art, but something about control and  <br/>\n&gt; respect?  That could help greatly.&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-------<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have suggested it several times but so far he&#39;s not interested in <br/>\nanything that is &quot;class-like.&quot;  Part of that reason is that he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like anyone telling him what to do or &quot;teaching&quot; him <br/>\nanything.  This has been an issue since he was a baby - he was one <br/>\nwho didn&#39;t want to &quot;walk&quot; with fingers (would push you away), would <br/>\npush his cart around the entire block while running but wouldn&#39;t walk <br/>\nwithout it until he was sure he could do it unassisted, and one who <br/>\nwants to do things differently than everyone else because &quot;why would <br/>\nhe want to do what everyone else is doing?&quot;  I can&#39;t tell you how <br/>\nmany times beginning from when he was a toddler (pre-unschooling) I <br/>\nhave heard teachers/adults say, &quot;I wish I could just break him!&quot;  <br/>\nThat&#39;s a sentiment I&#39;ve felt as well, and one that led us to look for <br/>\nways to interact more respectfully with each other.  It has helped <br/>\ntremendously and things are much better, but we still have a long way <br/>\nto go.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think that martial arts could be a really good thing for him <br/>\nthough and would love for him to find *someone, somewhere* whom he <br/>\nwould *want* to listen to (respect).  He&#39;s very athletic and enjoys <br/>\nsports, but once there&#39;s coaching or evaluations involved then he <br/>\nruns into conflicts.  He&#39;s an excellent skier, yet the coaches are <br/>\nall frustrated with him because he just won&#39;t follow instruction or <br/>\nlisten in a group.  If it&#39;s one-on-one he does much better, but at <br/>\nsome point it&#39;s very limiting.  They put up with him because he&#39;s a <br/>\ngood athlete, but they really don&#39;t want to deal with him.  (Think <br/>\nBode Miller... whose autobiography reveals a similar type of <br/>\npersonality.  On an interesting side note, Bode was unschooled until <br/>\n4th grade.)  He doesn&#39;t have any &quot;heroes&quot; or anyone he wants to be <br/>\nlike - he says he only wants to be like himself, which is great, but <br/>\nis frustrating to &quot;inspire&quot; him toward something.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Maybe suggest that to your son, that he IS responsible for his own  <br/>\n&gt; actions, and trouble won&#39;t come from you but from his own failure <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to be as good a guy as he should be, as he needs to be to get along.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThese have been my words since he was little.  Even when we were <br/>\nparenting traditionally we never found &quot;his currency;&quot; we never found <br/>\na &quot;control button.&quot;  The &quot;control&quot; that we&#39;ve found since unschooling <br/>\nhas been through cooperation and working together.

I want <br/>\nto help her find her way out of the hardness and back into feeling whatever feelings put <br/>\nher there in the first place.  There is no working with that hard place.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like it is a much, much more loving act to help her to re-find herself in these <br/>\nsituations than to go on as though everything is fine.   I tell her that we will need to go if <br/>\nshe can&#39;t find kindness for everyone.  I&#39;m not talking about something false, like love for <br/>\neveryone--but you can treat anyone with kindness.  And I don&#39;t say it punitively--more <br/>\nmatter of factly.  I explain that it isn&#39;t fair to the other child--and what I&#39;m talkiing about <br/>\nis boundaries.  She has no right to infringe on another&#39;s boundaries--just like I&#39;d protect <br/>\nher if I see someone infringing upon hers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI try not to be in situations with children that she doesn&#39;t like, but I can&#39;t always predict <br/>\nwho will be in every situtation, and it does occasionally come up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been times we&#39;ve left the situation, but more often than not she is able to <br/>\nmuster basic courtesy which may be enough.  I explain that she can feel how she feels <br/>\nabout that person, but she must be polite and not mean, or else we can&#39;t stay.  As she&#39;s <br/>\ngotten older, if a situation does come up, she will often remove herself for a &quot;time-out.&quot;  <br/>\n(These are self-motivated times to go collect herself.)

Long story short, he has a <br/>\nlove/hate relationship with a 6.5 yr old schooled neighbor boy.  <br/>\nRecently my ds has been aggressive toward him, pushing and shoving <br/>\nand generally &quot;taunting&quot; him.  They&#39;re both only children and many <br/>\ntimes we&#39;ve commented that they treat each other like siblings <br/>\nmight.  My ds seems to really enjoy the reaction he gets from the <br/>\nboy, which is usually along the lines of, &quot;You&#39;re going to get in <br/>\ntrouble!  I&#39;m going to tell.&quot;  Ds has recently been making a big <br/>\npoint of arguing back and saying that he won&#39;t get in trouble and it <br/>\nwon&#39;t matter if he does tell.  The playing usually ends there and <br/>\nsomebody goes home, mad, but they come around to play again the next <br/>\nday.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe recent issues of arguing seem to be fueled by jealousy if the <br/>\nother one has friends over, play dates, or feels left out.  Today <br/>\nthey both had friends over.  My ds and his friend were playing by <br/>\nthemselves outside on their scooters, and spotted the friend and dad <br/>\nwalking the guest home.  Ds scootered after the neighbor with <br/>\nharassing and taunting comments (according to all who heard - I was <br/>\nnot outside and didn&#39;t hear).  When the boy smacked ds with a shoe <br/>\n(that he was carrying), ds kicked him in the shins.  The boy went <br/>\nhome, told the mom, the mom (who is a very reasonable person) tried <br/>\nto call ds over to talk with him about it and ds ran away.  Several <br/>\nminutes later ds went over and rang their bell and proceeded to tell <br/>\nthe mom that &quot;I&#39;m not going to get in trouble and I never will.&quot;  The <br/>\nmom phoned me and explained what happened (with empathy, thank <br/>\ngoodness).  <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving come from punitive parents I&#39;m looking for respectful <br/>\nresponses.  The part that bothered me the most was ds&#39;s need to go <br/>\nring the bell and &quot;mouth off&quot; to the mom.  Ds&#39;s response was to ask <br/>\nwhy he should treat the adult differently than the child?  I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink it polite to treat anyone that way, but do realize that he&#39;s <br/>\nsaid this to the boy before and I didn&#39;t &quot;do&quot; anything about it <br/>\nexcept explain it wasn&#39;t cool, so *I am* treating this situation <br/>\ndifferently.  There ensued a discussion of examples of people <br/>\nyou &quot;must&quot; respect or face punishment - judges in a courtroom and <br/>\npolicemen.  My main goal is, &quot;What&#39;s the lesson learned?&quot; and so far <br/>\nI am not confident I have gotten the point across.  My words so far <br/>\nare obviously not working -- I could really use some suggestions on <br/>\nhow to help ds understand that &quot;mouthing off&quot; isn&#39;t cool and that <br/>\nthere is indeed a need for politeness and respect.  Also, ds&#39;s play <br/>\ndate friend was witness to ds&#39;s behavior and is very interested in <br/>\nwhat will &quot;happen&quot; to ds.  Dh and I told ds that we are very <br/>\nconcerned and will have to think about this some more and will get <br/>\nback to him about it in about 24 hours (basically long enough to ask <br/>\nfor help!).  Since telling him that he has been picking up his <br/>\nthings, cleaning his room, being sweet....<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nLinda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34771,"nextTopicId":34900}}
