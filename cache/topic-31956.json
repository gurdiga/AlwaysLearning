Unfortunately, while I was trying to find  <br/>\nit in the library, I tripped over a step stool with wheels and fell  <br/>\nand scraped up both my knees. Luckily, I didnt squish my baby, though  <br/>\nhe was asleep in the sling, which is why I couldnt see the dang stool  <br/>\nin front of me.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing he mentioned in the book is that in a survey they did, a  <br/>\nlarge number of children chose elephants as their favorite animal. My  <br/>\ndd, who is turning 4 in 2 weeks, has never mentioned elephants  <br/>\nbefore, but today told us a big long story about how much she wants  <br/>\nan elephant pinata for her birthday. She danced around waving her  <br/>\n&quot;trunk&quot; and made trumpet noises to show us what she wanted :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout Music & Lyrics...I had never wanted to see it before. But, two  <br/>\nthings happened. One was Sandra writing about how you can always get  <br/>\n*something* from an experience if you are open to it. The second was  <br/>\nspending an evening with my brother, who spits out practially every  <br/>\nsentence with his obvious disdain and disapproval. He was so snotty  <br/>\nand disagreeable, that I realized what a waste it is to be snobby and  <br/>\nsuperior. I resolved to be more open-not less discerning, but just  <br/>\nless snobby. I guess I had written off Music and Lyrics as a sappy  <br/>\nchick flick, but it was pretty funny in parts and I did like the  <br/>\nsongs. I really liked the teen pop princess! LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nanother connection....in the movie, Hugh Grants character is always  <br/>\nsarcastic, funny yes, but also a little mean. Its been on my mind  <br/>\nlately, sarcasm and optimism and unschooling....My DH is very  <br/>\nsarcastic and often uses it as a defense mechansim to deflect  <br/>\ncommunication, etc. and I wonder if I take his barbs too seriously or  <br/>\nsarcasm as a way of life is not compatible to peaceful family living.<br/>\n<br/>\nanyway, always learning,<br/>\nNancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\nblogging at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://happychildhood.homeschooljournal.net\">http://happychildhood.homeschooljournal.net</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31880,"nextTopicId":31913}}
