As I went along, though, it became more about learning and<br/>\nrelationships.  I was able to let go of the political part of it, mostly<br/>\nbecause, once it stopped having a hold on our lives, it ceased to be a<br/>\nproblem for me.

It&#39;s the shaming and force- <br/>\nmarching through reading chapters and answering questions without  <br/>\ntalking.  It&#39;s being pressed to read one book while another more  <br/>\ninteresting book is to lie untouched.   It&#39;s memorizing and reciting  <br/>\nthings that aren&#39;t even true, and being punished for questioning them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose bad parts of schooling are worse with school-at-home families  <br/>\nthan they are in school.  At least with school one could conceivably  <br/>\nfile a complaint or the parents could ask for a meeting with the  <br/>\nprincipal or counsellor or teacher.  With Christian school at home,  <br/>\nall appeals have been cut off by &quot;honor thy father and thy mother,&quot;  <br/>\nwho claim to be doing the direct will of God.  That&#39;s that.   If you  <br/>\nargue, you too are working with and by the devil who creates reality  <br/>\nshows and R-rated movies.  (I pretty much like school better than I  <br/>\nlike reality shows, too, to remain clear here.  If they would call  <br/>\nthem game shows instead of &quot;reality,&quot; I wouldn&#39;t bristle so much.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause what I care about is children having options and parents being  <br/>\nsupportive and compassionate, I was able to write<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice\">http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice</a><br/>\nwhich got me removed as an unpaid columnist for a California  <br/>\nhomeschooling newsletter years ago.<br/>\nThere are those among unschoolers and homeschoolers whose primary  <br/>\nfocus is politics rather than family.  I don&#39;t really want to support  <br/>\nthem, either.   They assume all homeschoolers hate the government and  <br/>\nwant schools to be dismantled.   I think schools should be there for  <br/>\nwhen those families&#39; kids can&#39;t stand the parents paying more  <br/>\nattention to political diatribe than their own children.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchooling isn&#39;t as good as natural learning.<br/>\nThere&#39;s my summary.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46084,"nextTopicId":46143}}
