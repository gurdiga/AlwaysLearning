Just like everything else in our house they lay around <br/>\nand get shuffled around and each of the kids has, at some time or another, <br/>\npicked them up and enjoyed fooling with them. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey are workbooks - but the kids can&#39;t really just pick them up and &quot;do&quot; <br/>\nthem - they don&#39;t have instructions in the workbook. You have to have what is <br/>\ncalled the &quot;Lab Sheet Annotations&quot; to give instructions to the child about <br/>\nwhat to do in the workbook. It emphasizes using manipulatives - cuisinairre <br/>\nrods in particular. <br/>\n<br/>\nI like them - if I had to have a math program for my young child, these would <br/>\nbe a nice, gentle approach. But they aren&#39;t the best for my &quot;leave it laying <br/>\naround&quot; curriculum &lt;BEG&gt; because they require the adult interaction. There <br/>\nare cool workshops or even lame workbooks that let kids fool around on their <br/>\nown, but these are definitely not like that. On the other hand, I think that <br/>\npulling out the Miquon math books to work on was one way my kids discovered <br/>\nthey could nearly always capture my undivided attention. <br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":85171455,"authorName":"Karin","from":"&quot;Karin&quot; &lt;curtkar@...&gt;","profile":"kc85022","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] miquon?","postDate":"1008710287","msgId":906,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMzAwMWMxODgwOSQ3ZDNjYmJlMCQ2NDAwYThjMEBnb2R6aWxsYT4=","referencesHeader":"PDNDMUZBMTU2LjVGN0Q1QzVBQG1vdGhlci5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":903,"nextInTopic":959,"prevInTime":905,"nextInTime":907,"topicId":903,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We ve used almost all the miquon books -  from orange to yellow.
