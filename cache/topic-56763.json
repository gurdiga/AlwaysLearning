Snuggling and talking are common teen activities at that campout and, I&#39;ve heard, other events that draw groups of unschooling teens.<br/>\n<br/>\n That&#39;s a dynamic that&#39;s startling from the perspective of schooled teens - &quot;just&quot; snuggling and talking? No way! But yes, really, lots of snuggling and talking go on in ways that are both more &quot;innocent&quot; and playful, and also more &quot;mature&quot; in the sense of being thoughtful and responsible. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":171003866,"authorName":"Thea","from":"&quot;Thea&quot; &lt;musicmom98233@...&gt;","profile":"musicmom98233","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: &quot;Maturity&quot; in unschooled teens","postDate":"1281834208","msgId":56769,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGk0N2VkMCt0aWk4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDI0NzBBQkQ3LTk2NDQtNEI2Ny05NTg2LUY3OTc0NDM5NjU2QUBTYW5kcmFEb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":56763,"nextInTopic":56774,"prevInTime":56768,"nextInTime":56770,"topicId":56763,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I love those pop-up tents (truth is, I ve always secretly wanted one!)

Having real opportunities to be responsible and trustworthy is part of it, but I think the maturity people pick up on isn&#39;t just from that.  The unschooled teens I know seem to have had a chance to develop a sense of who they are as people, at a time when most teens (and many &#39;way older folks) haven&#39;t got a clue, and so drift with the social currents.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see this in my 16 yo unschooled son, who helps younger kids learn Magic or D&D, earns money for things he wants, volunteers for community work, and helps me when I ask or when he sees it&#39;s needed -- but who is also not at all interested in driving, or dating, or other things which might be taken as milestones of maturity in our world.  When people seem surprised that he&#39;s not dying to do the things other kids his age are doing, it doesn&#39;t phase him. He says he is very happy with his life and he realizes many other people aren&#39;t.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"&quot;Maturity&quot; in unschooled teens","postDate":"1281801360","msgId":56763,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI0NzBBQkQ3LTk2NDQtNEI2Ny05NTg2LUY3OTc0NDM5NjU2QUBTYW5kcmFEb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":56769,"prevInTime":56762,"nextInTime":56764,"topicId":56763,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"What s below was on my blog a couple of days ago, but it occurred to me this morning that it s something that might be interesting here.

It all rolls together to remind me of questions  <br/>\npeople ask about unschooled kids, about them being &quot;more mature.&quot; I  <br/>\nthink with a different kind of parenting, and in the absence of  <br/>\nschool, something happens that transcends the idea of &quot;maturity&quot;  <br/>\nitself. Many of the behaviors associated with &quot;maturity&quot; and  <br/>\n&quot;immaturity&quot; and &quot;acting like a teen&quot; and all of that have to do with  <br/>\nthe strictures and manipulation traditional in mainstream families and  <br/>\nschool. &quot;Act your age,&quot; or &quot;You can do that when you&#39;re older,&quot; or  <br/>\n&quot;That&#39;s for babies,&quot; or &quot;Why are you hanging out with little kids?&quot; or  <br/>\n&quot;He&#39;s much too old for you.&quot; All that framework of judgmental noise  <br/>\nfrom parents and friends and neighbors serves to remove a person&#39;s  <br/>\npreferences and choices, in favor of doing just what will produce the  <br/>\nleast clucking and finger-wagging from others (or worse than noise, in  <br/>\nthe case of young boys).<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause we gave our children real opportunities to be responsible when  <br/>\nthey were young, they&#39;re trustworthy young adults. Because we didn&#39;t  <br/>\ndiscourage childlike curiosity and play, Holly is willing to put her  <br/>\nlittle pop-up play tent on top of her new twin bed and crawl in there  <br/>\nto sleep on a night when she had the car and the possible intention of  <br/>\nstaying out all night with party friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not maturity or immaturity. It&#39;s a confident life full of choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56760,"nextTopicId":56770}}
