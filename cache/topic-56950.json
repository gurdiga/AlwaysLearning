Yet the<br/>\nreading I did that was my own was fun, and I remember it with happiness.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame for my child. Whatever he chooses to do, it&#39;s his. I like Andrea&#39;s<br/>\ndescription of her four year figuring out how to double the time to get the<br/>\nround trip of 16 stops until they&#39;re back home.

To me it&#39;s very like the discovery of new words for babies<br/>\nlearning to talk. Karl asked me the other day what expensive is, and today<br/>\nhe asked me to spell smörgåsbord, which I thought I misspelled but I<br/>\nactually didn&#39;t, yet it would have been fine even if I had misspelled it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever a child is learning, it&#39;s the same. Learning arithmetic is the same<br/>\nas discovering new words to speak with. More words. Different words, more<br/>\nconnections, other applications.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd no matter who first invents or discovers something, there might be<br/>\nsomeone somewhere else inventing or discovering it too, at the same time or<br/>\nat another time. That&#39;s what happened with many of the great discoveries: it<br/>\nwasn&#39;t easy to know who to give the Nobel or the Pulitzer to because the<br/>\ndiscovery/invention happened in several places fairly simultaneously.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":304763189,"authorName":"cookiesforthree","from":"&quot;cookiesforthree&quot; &lt;cookiesforthree@...&gt;","profile":"cookiesforthree","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Learning multiplication","postDate":"1282764686","msgId":57015,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGk1M3IyZStvc21vQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGluSkNyNlU0OWR4eEJNaVRuUS1YWmNyQjY2cm1aMlM5UlhyRnZnYUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":57001,"nextInTopic":57050,"prevInTime":57014,"nextInTime":57016,"topicId":56950,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I loved, loved the youtube video of multiplying by 9 using your hands!!! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVbcra3rCqc Whenever my kids hear me on youtube, they","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1029119486\">I loved, loved the youtube video of multiplying by 9 using your hands!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVbcra3rCqc\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVbcra3rCqc</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWhenever my kids hear me on youtube, they come running to see what I&#39;m watching.

Then we were browsing the aisles in Rite-Aid<br/>\na couple nights ago and he pointed it out again so I got it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt turned out to be a lot of playing with multiplication or what I call<br/>\naccelerated addition. We&#39;ve played with similar ideas with Lego bricks and<br/>\nalso just talking out loud about how quantities work and how to count or<br/>\nweigh things up. At the grocery store, if I say I have exactly $20 we figure<br/>\nout what we can get with that and such a problem involves doubling or<br/>\ntripling things we can buy. In fact, the first time we talked about anything<br/>\nto do with multiplying ... it was a question about the meaning of the words<br/>\ndouble, triple, quadruple, etc. Later when Karl wanted to know what 100%<br/>\nmeans, I explained with examples of doubling all of one thing makes 200%,<br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarl got it. Learning is an organic process for each individual. I really<br/>\nwasn&#39;t confident with any of it until oh about 5th or 6th grade. I went to<br/>\nschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally did not have fun in any multiplication competitions. Karl, as good<br/>\nas he is with these ideas, hates to be on the spot and get something wrong<br/>\nbecause it makes him feel dumb. Really! about something he&#39;s hardly slow at,<br/>\nwhich he&#39;s not yet perfect or totally smooth at. It takes a lot of thinking<br/>\nabout how it goes before he can rattle stuff off. He volunteers lots of<br/>\nthese things after an undisclosed amount of thinking goes by. He couldn&#39;t do<br/>\nthat in a quiz type game setting because it would be a matter of thinking of<br/>\nthe correct answers with an audience looking on or racing to answer before<br/>\nhe could. Like Jeopardy. Imagine the pressure to think of correct replies as<br/>\na large group of people looks on, holding their collective breath and<br/>\ngasping at what your child says. Even at home with close family, it could be<br/>\na bit much.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe your child wants to try memorizing. Maybe the child thinks everybody<br/>\n&quot;should&quot; be able to memorize. I don&#39;t memorize info well and, since I went<br/>\nto school, it was required. I remember how hard multiplication was for me. I<br/>\nstill add up (skip count) to get the right amount even though my mom, who&#39;s<br/>\ngood at memorizing, showed me all the memorizing tricks for the higher<br/>\nnumbers. If your child wants to play a multiplication competition, I would<br/>\nbe sensitive to changes in interest to continue or discontinue, and keep it<br/>\nas low key as possible, with the emphasis on fun. If the child no longer is<br/>\nhaving fun (struggling/frozen/frowning), have some familiar things in mind<br/>\nready to transition to that are pretty sure to be fun for the child.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want learning to keep rolling along as effortlessly as it has been. So far<br/>\nKarl&#39;s very confident at getting ideas and using them in his own chosen<br/>\nexample, in a unique unexpected example usually.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, Aug 24, 2010 at 2:04 PM, Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Subject: learning multipication<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What is a fun way to learn how to memorize multipication facts.
