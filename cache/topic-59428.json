In the past, if she&#39;s gotten upset and needed some time to chill out before returning to playing,  he has said things like, &quot;I didn&#39;t come over here to watch you cry,&quot; so maybe she&#39;s transferring that to thinking that he *is* coming here to play with the computer.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra suggested meeting elsewhere, so I&#39;m wondering if it might just be easier, for now, to meet at his house.

Generally when I can do that, the kids might still play video games or watch a movie, but its later when they need a break anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith one of Mo&#39;s friends we&#39;ve experimented with putting the controllers for the video games away before the visit - this is someone who tends to fight with Mo over the games (I mean they both fight, its not just him). This last time, though, she didn&#39;t want to do that so I talked with her a little bit about ways to accomodate company. I didn&#39;t make a rule &quot;always do what company wants&quot; (I grew up with that one) but I did talk about hospitality and how it&#39;s kind and generous to let friends take the lead a bit - and with video games that means having the &quot;number one&quot; controller. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Hanging out with non-unschoolers TV/computer issues","postDate":"1296759619","msgId":59430,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEMzMjgxRjk3LUVDQjMtNEVCNS1CNTQyLTgxM0YyNTQwODk0OEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDUwN0MwQTE0LUNBQTktNDZFQS05M0Y0LTI1MTc4RjFGMjlCOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGlpZXNzMys4ODJtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NTA3QzBBMTQtQ0FBOS00NkVBLTkzRjQtMjUxNzhGMUYyOUI4QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":59429,"nextInTopic":59431,"prevInTime":59429,"nextInTime":59431,"topicId":59428,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Has anyone tried talking to the other mom in these cases-=- I did talk to my friend Carol, but kind of the other way around.

When Kirby was five he would visit with her four kids, but he only wanted to play Nintendo.  They had one they kept in the closet and brought out when the kids requested it.  Kirby always asked for it.  When it was time to leave, he would cry because he hadn&#39;t wanted to play with the kids.   So we bought him a Nintendo, and I told Carol why, and after that he played with her kids (who weren&#39;t big into Nintendo, particularly) and came home and played Mario and Ninja Turtles.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat didn&#39;t translate, though, was that when Carol&#39;s kids came to our house, they wanted to watch TV if it was on.  They would pass by the TV on the way to Kirby&#39;s room, and if there was ANYthing on, they stood mesmerized and couldn&#39;t proceed.  So I learned to turn the TV off and usher them happily to a pre-arranged exciting activity so that they were already playing before they thought about the TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Hanging out with non-unschoolers TV/computer issues","postDate":"1296758853","msgId":59429,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUwN0MwQTE0LUNBQTktNDZFQS05M0Y0LTI1MTc4RjFGMjlCOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlpZXNzMys4ODJtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlpZXNzMys4ODJtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":59428,"nextInTopic":59430,"prevInTime":59428,"nextInTime":59430,"topicId":59428,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Has anyone tried talking to the other mom in these cases?

If others are too busy to revisit, and you know where the thread is, could you send me a link, please?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m needing some input on how do deal with kids who come over who don&#39;t have freedom at home in regards to computer and TV time and so are drawn to those things at our house.  My daughter had a heartbreaking visit with a dear friend last week who wanted to watch movies or play on the computer the whole time he was here. She cried for a long time after he left, because she felt like he didn&#39;t love her anymore. I suggested that *I* can say no to TV/computers when he&#39;s here next time, but she doesn&#39;t want him to think I&#39;m mean, and I think she&#39;s afraid that he won&#39;t want to come over again if he can&#39;t use the computer. I don&#39;t think that would really happen though. She *is* his favorite friend and vice-versa.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat has worked in your homes when this crops up?<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone tried talking to the other mom in these cases?
