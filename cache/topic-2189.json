Ack.<br/>\nLet&#39;s see if I can remember everything I wanted to respond to........<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you Sandra, for the compliment about my dh. I think he&#39;s a hunk!  We&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen triathlon training and his body is shaping up VERY nicely (you know, the <br/>\nlean biker type) . Aaah, but I won&#39;t go there.<br/>\nHe&#39;s been told about four times in the last month (by perfect strangers) that <br/>\nhe looks like Rick Springsteen??!! I don&#39;t see it. I think he&#39;s hunky, but I <br/>\ndon&#39;t see the Springsteen look at all. <br/>\nAs to the hair issue....<br/>\nI love him with a three day growth look, kinda stubbly and rugged looking. He <br/>\nalways looked that way when we did mountain climbing and it always attracted <br/>\nme. That outdoor, hiker dude look, YK?<br/>\nI&#39;ve pushed him to grow his hair long again but he swears it affects people&#39;s <br/>\ndecision to hire you down here. I believe him.<br/>\nSome jobs it doesn&#39;t matter, others it might.<br/>\nNow here&#39;s the rub, he shaved his LEGS!! Yep, right down to the smooth skin. <br/>\nYUCKO. I can&#39;t stand it. He did it to see what those &quot;real&quot; biker/triathlete <br/>\ntypes go through. He says it feels better because your bike tights don&#39;t pull <br/>\non the hairs, I guess it&#39;s annoying. But I HATE the smooth leg look on a guy. <br/>\nI can live with short head hair if he&#39;ll just grow the damn leg hair back.<br/>\nMy FIL shaved his beard after 30+ years of having it and my kids didn&#39;t <br/>\nrecognize him....I wouldn&#39;t have either except for the voice!! He grew it <br/>\nback when the kids were afraid to come too close.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just had to comment on NM too. We spent very little time there, but thought <br/>\nSanta Fe was magical! We had some wonderful moments there. As we walked <br/>\nthrough downtown a light snow began to fall and the kids positively DANCED up <br/>\nthe street, twirling and laughing and throwing their heads back to catch <br/>\nsnowflakes. We visited that little chapel with the &quot;miracle&quot; winding <br/>\nstaircase, it was warm and welcoming after dancing in the snow. We spent part <br/>\nof a day at the little children&#39;s museum where the kids met a local artist <br/>\nand created sculptures to be auctioned off for support of the animal shelter.<br/>\nGreat memories.<br/>\nAnd although Alamagordo didn&#39;t offer much, we had a BLAST at White Sands <br/>\nMonument! The sand looked so inviting and we all slid down it. But it was <br/>\nbloody COLD sand in November! We saw a Stealth fighter fly overhead which <br/>\nreally was impressive. The mountains and natural beauty were refreshing. We <br/>\nwould definitely visit again.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur beaches have sand as white as that White Sands Monument though! And I can <br/>\nswim too....well, at least most of the year. Anyone that wants to see our <br/>\nbeaches can look in the photo section...I posted one of dh and kids from 1998 <br/>\nwhen we first arrived here (so no Jalen in the pic). We love <br/>\nvisitors...unfortunately don&#39;t have enough room in our little house for <br/>\novernighters, but if anyone comes through please let me know!! I&#39;m a good <br/>\ntour guide...there&#39;s plenty of kid friendly activities around, even without <br/>\nthe beach.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2242,"nextTopicId":2245}}
