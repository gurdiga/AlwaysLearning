In buying games for kids and helping them find games they enjoy, it can be important to figure out what parts they like. Ray likes a little problem-solving, some steamy scenes now and then, and lots of gore. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s not a violent person, irl, if anything he&#39;s very good at non-violent problem solving.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 8yo dd sometimes watches him play, but doesn&#39;t play the same sorts of games, herself. She prefers games like Spongebob: Battle for Bikini Bottom and the like, some of which include killing pretend animals or people. She&#39;s never once tried to take out the cats with a sword ;) She does enjoy playing Ray&#39;s skateboarding game - which has lots of blood in the crashes, although no body parts flying every which way, but she plays it very differently than he does. Where Ray likes to crash and crash and crash again, Mo prefers to create the different parks in that portion of the game - that&#39;s something I look for more and more when I&#39;m shopping for games for her, the ability to generate parts of the game, design environments or whatever. Ray has almost no interest in that sort of thing. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Intro and ?","postDate":"1277747165","msgId":55406,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRDMjhERkRELjYwNDAyMDFAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDE0RjZFRkI1LTk1M0ItNDg1Qy05Q0MxLTQwMjI3REE4MDQ3RUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGkwM2Y4aSs3OWwzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8QjZCMDhBN0YxNDdFNEYxMUJGQUE4MDE2QTI4OUE5QjZAVGFtYXJhPiA8Q0Y1QzVENzctQkI3RS00MzVELUEzMUUtNzU2QzlEMTNDQzQ0QHZlcml6b24ubmV0PiA8MTRGNkVGQjUtOTUzQi00ODVDLTlDQzEtNDAyMjdEQTgwNDdFQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":55396,"nextInTopic":55407,"prevInTime":55405,"nextInTime":55407,"topicId":55261,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
