I am guessing <br/>\nthat it happened like this, based on various reports.  Lexie had her <br/>\nautograph book and gave it to another child to sign.  The child <br/>\naccidently brought it upstairs to the stage right before a scene and <br/>\ngave it to Lexie just as the curtains were opening.  Lexie was mad <br/>\nbecause she thought the scene was ruined and stuffed the book under the <br/>\nbed.  Later as the girls were going back downstairs Lexie confronted the <br/>\ngirl and somehow became mad and lost her temper and pushed the girl hard <br/>\nagainst the wall.  The girl pushed Lexie back and two older girls <br/>\nstepped in and pulled Lexie away.  Lexie accused them of &quot;acting like my <br/>\nmother&quot; and &quot;being mean&quot; but the girls said they were afraid Lexie was <br/>\ngoing to hurt the other child.  I think the older girls were quick to <br/>\nput an end to the situation and were not overly mean--lexie is very <br/>\nsensitive to others telling her what to do. At first Lexie tried to tell <br/>\nme she was &quot;playing around&quot; and it got rough but later she admitted that <br/>\nshe had lost her temper and had deliberately pushed the child.  I really <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know how to handle it.  On one hand, I didn&#39;t want to be the mom <br/>\nwho feels her child never does anything wrong and therefore blame the <br/>\nincident on the other child(ren).  On the other hand, I did want to be <br/>\nfair to everyone.  Lexie is the same age as the other child but the <br/>\nother child is a bit smaller so... Lexie did apologize and she felt very <br/>\nbad about it later, but it really brought to my attention that Lexie has <br/>\na temper!  We all had a nice chat and agreed that it was settled.  The <br/>\nolder girls apologized to Lexie for scaring her, reiterating that they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t mean to act like her mother but were stopping something quick.  I <br/>\nstill feel they did a fine job of dealing with the situation and I will <br/>\nbe sure to tell them that next week.  It was my daughter who was the <br/>\ninstigator and I feel a bit funny about that.  I understood when she was <br/>\ntwo and got into it with another child, but when she&#39;s 8? She should <br/>\nknow better, right?  <br/>\n<br/>\nLater I found out the child is the daughter of an email friend.  We&#39;ve <br/>\nmet a few times but I didn&#39;t put it together at the moment.  I had <br/>\nalready told Lexie she needed to apologize to the mom of the girl, and <br/>\nwhen I realized the mom was this friend, I felt relieved.  I knew Diana <br/>\nwould handle the situation well, and she did.  Lexie admitted to Diana <br/>\nthat she had lost her temper and shoved her daughter and apologized and <br/>\nDiana said she thought more of Lexie because Lexie was able to go to <br/>\nDiana and tell her.  So it&#39;s all over, but I&#39;m still a bit upset over <br/>\nthis... I have the old thought in my head that I wish I would stop <br/>\nthinking--what did I do wrong to create a child who would shove another <br/>\nchild.  :-(  <br/>\n<br/>\nComfort me please, and tell me I handled this appropriately.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically I was raised a pacifist. My parents never even talked about <br/>\ndefending myself, I was simply never to get into a fight or be physical <br/>\nwith anyone.  I did not want to do that to my own child.  I feel that <br/>\nself defense is necessary sometimes, rarely.  As a teen I was in a few <br/>\nsituation where I should have been free to defend myself but could not, <br/>\nor I tried and looked like a fool.  I&#39;m trying to find the middle <br/>\nground, raising a non-violent child who realizes that violence doesn&#39;t <br/>\nsolve anything but at the same time letting her know that self defense <br/>\nis OK.  Also, we obviously need to work on her temper--or should I just <br/>\nchalk this up to a stressful weekend, she&#39;s in her first play, not <br/>\nenough sleep, she has a cold, etc.  <br/>\nJoylyn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14832,"nextTopicId":14911}}
