And he doesn&#39;t know all that much about school  <br/>\nsubjects.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~<br/>\n <br/>\nJust now in the car we had the same conversation.  All I could think  of was <br/>\nall the things he does know about baseball, and all the trips he&#39;s taken  and <br/>\nthe places he&#39;s been.  What he knows is what he knows, and it&#39;s not  <br/>\nquantifiable and it&#39;s in him and it can&#39;t be measured.  The whole reason we  measure <br/>\nkids is ONLY because they are in school.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI explained it to him like this:  <br/>\n <br/>\nMost of the kids born in 1993 all learned the same things by the time they  <br/>\nwere 5.  They learned how to walk and talk and letters and colors and  numbers, <br/>\netc.  Then some of them went to school.  So those kids were  all in the same <br/>\ngrade and in the first year they learned this and this and  this.  (I gestured <br/>\nwith my hands to signify a brief section of time.)   Then they moved into the <br/>\nnext grade and learned this and this and this (using my  hands to form <br/>\nanother section of time).  And the next year, this and this  and this.  But you, <br/>\nWill, and other unschooled kids, they get to age 5 and  they learn this (I put my <br/>\nhand in the first section) and this (I moved my hand  far ahead on the <br/>\nimaginary line) and this (then moved it back a little), and  THIS (and I moved my <br/>\nhand to way past the end of the line into something most  people learn only as <br/>\nadults), and that&#39;s the same way you&#39;ve been learning your  entire life.  When <br/>\nall of you that were born in 1993 get to be 18 or 20,  most of you will know <br/>\npretty much the same things as everyone else born  then.  Except YOU might not <br/>\nknow what Plymouth Rock is until you&#39;re 25, and  that&#39;s okay, because you went <br/>\n25 years without ever having a NEED to know  what Plymouth Rock is.  And THEY <br/>\nmight not know so much about New York,  because they might never have a NEED <br/>\nto know that.  Just like you learned  to read when your brain was ready, you <br/>\nwill learn the things you need to know  when you need to know them.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThen I picked up a piece of junk mail off the dashboard.  It had a  bullet <br/>\nlist of four things on it.  I said, &quot;Teachers sometimes decide for  instance, <br/>\nthat this is a list of all the things a kid should know in 4th grade  about a <br/>\ncertain thing.  The best students in the class might sit and listen  to all <br/>\nthat, learn something, and be able to remember it all and put it on a  test.  Some <br/>\nof the kids who aren&#39;t such good students might get one of the  things and <br/>\nvaguely remember the rest.  And then some of them will pick out  #2 on the list <br/>\nand really want to know much much more about that one thing,  but they won&#39;t <br/>\nbe able to learn anymore than the teacher is willing to give  them, or what&#39;s <br/>\nin the textbook.  You are not forced to learn anything at  all, but if you <br/>\nwanted to pick out #2 on the list and learn all you can about  it, you could do <br/>\nthat and keep on doing it until you are through.  Or you  could learn about #2 <br/>\nand then be slightly interested in 3 and 4, or just ignore  the list <br/>\naltogether.  Kids in school don&#39;t have that choice.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThen he said this, &quot;I know!  It&#39;s like a &quot;learn sandwich&quot; and  someone&#39;s <br/>\ntrying to stuff it in their mouth!&quot;  and he put his hand  to my mouth as if to <br/>\nstuff in a sandwich.  I said, &quot;Yes!  And  what happens if you eat something you <br/>\ndon&#39;t like?&quot;  He stuck out his tongue  and made vomit noises as only a 10 yo <br/>\nboy can do.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt was a nice conversation, fun and animated.

His dad and I are from the stone age.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;You and I understand, from experience and lengthy discussions that <br/>\n&gt; &gt;learning something &quot;in context&quot; is different from learning it out <br/>\n </span></blockquote>of <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;context.  (Especially for those of us who like illustrative <br/>\n </span></blockquote>examples.)  I <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;realize you can&#39;t really &quot;manuever&quot; him, but IF he ended up in <br/>\n </span></blockquote>situations <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;with the potential for on the job learning, he would probably <br/>\n </span></blockquote>learn a lot.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; The job he&#39;s been doing has given him a lot of knowledge about <br/>\n </span></blockquote>forestry, <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; which he doesn&#39;t want to do for a living. &lt;g&gt; His volunteer work, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>helping <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; sometimes at the bike store, has shown him that he&#39;d need to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>improve his <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; writing and probably arithmetic skills in order to do that kind of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>work. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He&#39;s fine with assembling and repairing bicycles. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;(Manuevering him would be a bad idea.  At his age, I think it&#39;d <br/>\n </span></blockquote>piss him <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;off.  It would p-o me!)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t go there. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Personally, I have been listening to books on tape recently, while <br/>\n&gt; &gt;quilting and while doing housework.  I&#39;m enjoying it.  I don&#39;t <br/>\n </span></blockquote>know if <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;Lars would like it at all, but if he did, I would recommend some <br/>\n </span></blockquote>books <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;about different learning styles.  The last one I read (which I <br/>\n </span></blockquote>only read <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;parts of) was _The Myth of Laziness_, by Mel Levine.  (It&#39;s <br/>\n </span></blockquote>written by a <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;man, not a mom, and he&#39;s a doctor, so maybe &lt;g&gt; Lars would find <br/>\n </span></blockquote>him <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;credible.)  It&#39;s very accepting of the idea that there are <br/>\n </span></blockquote>learning <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;differences.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is a thought. He isn&#39;t interested in listening to fiction on <br/>\n </span></blockquote>tape. I <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; tried that. He used to love being read to or listening to fiction <br/>\n </span></blockquote>on tape. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That all stopped when I coerced him into learning to read . . . <br/>\n </span></blockquote>sigh. I <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; think one trouble with listening to tapes is that he doesn&#39;t like <br/>\n </span></blockquote>just <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; sitting and listening. And if he&#39;s doing something, it&#39;s probably <br/>\n </span></blockquote>riding <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; his bike or something. I&#39;ll ask him though.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;m coming to accept that my kid doesn&#39;t love books the way I do <br/>\n </span></blockquote>(except <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;read aloud) but he learns a lot from television.  I do tend to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>believe <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;that Nova is more educational than Ed, Edd and Eddy, but I see <br/>\n </span></blockquote>some value <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;in even the shrillest cartoons.  A locally produced PBS show, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>called Real <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;Science (I think) has young teens interviewing different <br/>\n </span></blockquote>scientists about <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;careers, so it&#39;s the TV show that comes to mind when I think about <br/>\n </span></blockquote>TV as a <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;form of &quot;career education&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve definitely gotten over my distrust of TV. &lt;g&gt; *I* know that he <br/>\n </span></blockquote>learns <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; lots from watching, but I don&#39;t think he knows. Also, he tends to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>watch <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; when he can&#39;t think of anything to do, so he thinks of it as a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>boredom <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; buster rather than something interesting.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Have you even seen any of the Standard Deviants videos?  They <br/>\n </span></blockquote>don&#39;t <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;substitute for a whole semesters course in anything, but they give <br/>\n </span></blockquote>a fast <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;familiarity with the terminology in a &quot;subject&quot; and maybe take the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>fear <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;and mystery out of something like Trigonometry or Geology.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They sound good, but I just checked the library. They have a bunch <br/>\n </span></blockquote>of <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Spanish and French, and one biology. I&#39;ll order that one for him. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ah, the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; other library system I use has one about mythology, including LOTR. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ordered that one too.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;I would recommend seeing Farenheit 911 for anyone who is a budding <br/>\n&gt; &gt;filmmaker, just to analyze it and see what makes it powerful.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s seen it. I don&#39;t really know if he&#39;s looking at feature type <br/>\n </span></blockquote>films <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; with editing in mind.

But he&#39;s had the computer, the camera, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the right <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; cables, and some film for several months now and hasn&#39;t done much. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>He keeps <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; saying he needs to get more footage in order to edit, but he <br/>\n </span></blockquote>doesn&#39;t go out <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and get footage.

He still doesn&#39;t believe that the<br/>\n&gt;motivation can come from within.**<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hi, Tia --<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Do you suppose Lars doesn&#39;t share your faith that he *can* do academics, <br/>\n&gt;if he needs them?  Does he assume that it will be horrendously difficult <br/>\n&gt;and take years?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Absolutely.<br/>\nMore background. Lars has no homeschooling friends anymore. All his friends <br/>\ngo to school. He&#39;s met them through his sports activities. He hears them <br/>\ntalk about what they have to do and learn in school, and he seems to feel <br/>\nhe could never do any of it, or at least not &quot;in time&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;That may explain why he&#39;s more worried than you are.  I have to say that I <br/>\n&gt;read the John Holt claims that all school mathematics could be learned in <br/>\n&gt;three (?) months and the first several times I read that, I didn&#39;t believe <br/>\n&gt;it.  (I spent years doing math homework and figured that it was building <br/>\n&gt;my brain somehow.)  Over time I came to believe that what Holt claimed was <br/>\n&gt;possible was possible, but I denied it at first.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve always believed it in my head. My gut is another matter. Math was a <br/>\nhuge obstacle for me, and I still haven&#39;t gotten past that. I&#39;ve tried to <br/>\nmostly stay out of it with Lars because my explanations of things never <br/>\nseem to make sense to him. Rod seems to be able to help him better than I <br/>\ncan, but his work keeps him too busy to do much of it. I found a website <br/>\nthat seemed to be working for him. It goes through the basics of arithmetic <br/>\nwith an emphasis on understanding and mental math. He did a bunch of it, <br/>\neven taking some time off from it to learn the multiplication tables. But <br/>\nhe works in spurts and then has to go back quite a ways when he starts <br/>\nagain after some time off.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t seem at all interested in a profession that would require <br/>\n&quot;higher math&quot;, but the trades courses in the colleges here usually require <br/>\ngrade 10, 11, or 12 math, depending on the course. My feeling is that he <br/>\ncould learn the stuff he needs quite quickly *if* he really wanted to. So I <br/>\ntend to think he just isn&#39;t interested and leave it at that. But if he <br/>\nthinks he can&#39;t . . . I&#39;m not sure what to do about that.<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t help at all that his girlfriend of the past year is a straight A <br/>\nstudent who does very well in math. And no, he would never consider getting <br/>\nher to tutor him. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I think there&#39;s a developmental stage when kids get skeptical about <br/>\n&gt;everything that their moms have to say.  For me, when my mom told me that <br/>\n&gt;I wasn&#39;t fat as a teen (weighing 140), I just shook my head and figured <br/>\n&gt;she had to say really blind, dorky things because she was my mother.  I <br/>\n&gt;knew she was not objective, and I figured she was also hopelessly out of touch.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh absolutely. His dad and I are from the stone age.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;You and I understand, from experience and lengthy discussions that <br/>\n&gt;learning something &quot;in context&quot; is different from learning it out of <br/>\n&gt;context.  (Especially for those of us who like illustrative examples.)  I <br/>\n&gt;realize you can&#39;t really &quot;manuever&quot; him, but IF he ended up in situations <br/>\n&gt;with the potential for on the job learning, he would probably learn a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The job he&#39;s been doing has given him a lot of knowledge about forestry, <br/>\nwhich he doesn&#39;t want to do for a living. &lt;g&gt; His volunteer work, helping <br/>\nsometimes at the bike store, has shown him that he&#39;d need to improve his <br/>\nwriting and probably arithmetic skills in order to do that kind of work. <br/>\nHe&#39;s fine with assembling and repairing bicycles. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;(Manuevering him would be a bad idea.  At his age, I think it&#39;d piss him <br/>\n&gt;off.  It would p-o me!)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t go there. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Personally, I have been listening to books on tape recently, while <br/>\n&gt;quilting and while doing housework.  I&#39;m enjoying it.  I don&#39;t know if <br/>\n&gt;Lars would like it at all, but if he did, I would recommend some books <br/>\n&gt;about different learning styles.  The last one I read (which I only read <br/>\n&gt;parts of) was _The Myth of Laziness_, by Mel Levine.  (It&#39;s written by a <br/>\n&gt;man, not a mom, and he&#39;s a doctor, so maybe &lt;g&gt; Lars would find him <br/>\n&gt;credible.)  It&#39;s very accepting of the idea that there are learning <br/>\n&gt;differences.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a thought. He isn&#39;t interested in listening to fiction on tape. I <br/>\ntried that. He used to love being read to or listening to fiction on tape. <br/>\nThat all stopped when I coerced him into learning to read . . . sigh. I <br/>\nthink one trouble with listening to tapes is that he doesn&#39;t like just <br/>\nsitting and listening. And if he&#39;s doing something, it&#39;s probably riding <br/>\nhis bike or something. I&#39;ll ask him though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;m coming to accept that my kid doesn&#39;t love books the way I do (except <br/>\n&gt;read aloud) but he learns a lot from television.  I do tend to believe <br/>\n&gt;that Nova is more educational than Ed, Edd and Eddy, but I see some value <br/>\n&gt;in even the shrillest cartoons.  A locally produced PBS show, called Real <br/>\n&gt;Science (I think) has young teens interviewing different scientists about <br/>\n&gt;careers, so it&#39;s the TV show that comes to mind when I think about TV as a <br/>\n&gt;form of &quot;career education&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve definitely gotten over my distrust of TV. &lt;g&gt; *I* know that he learns <br/>\nlots from watching, but I don&#39;t think he knows. Also, he tends to watch <br/>\nwhen he can&#39;t think of anything to do, so he thinks of it as a boredom <br/>\nbuster rather than something interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Have you even seen any of the Standard Deviants videos?  They don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;substitute for a whole semesters course in anything, but they give a fast <br/>\n&gt;familiarity with the terminology in a &quot;subject&quot; and maybe take the fear <br/>\n&gt;and mystery out of something like Trigonometry or Geology.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They sound good, but I just checked the library. They have a bunch of <br/>\nSpanish and French, and one biology. I&#39;ll order that one for him. Ah, the <br/>\nother library system I use has one about mythology, including LOTR. I&#39;ve <br/>\nordered that one too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I would recommend seeing Farenheit 911 for anyone who is a budding <br/>\n&gt;filmmaker, just to analyze it and see what makes it powerful.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>He&#39;s seen it. I don&#39;t really know if he&#39;s looking at feature type films <br/>\nwith editing in mind. I know he&#39;s not interested in making fictional films, <br/>\nand so far the only non-fiction type film he&#39;s shown an interest in making <br/>\nis biking videos.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I even wonder how interested he really is in film. I understood <br/>\nwhen it took him ages to decide what he wanted in a computer, in terms of <br/>\nbeing able to do editing. But he&#39;s had the computer, the camera, the right <br/>\ncables, and some film for several months now and hasn&#39;t done much. He keeps <br/>\nsaying he needs to get more footage in order to edit, but he doesn&#39;t go out <br/>\nand get footage. I never know whether to just leave it or keep asking if he <br/>\nneeds anything else, any help, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Overtime, now that we have the technology, pictures and moving pictures <br/>\n&gt;will replace words on the page as how we communicate.  Lars&#39; is just ahead <br/>\n&gt;of his time.  (But his time is rapidly arriving.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree with this. How to get it across to him . . . ?<br/>\nThanks Betsy.

He came to me and was hugging the New York book to his  chest.  <br/>\n(He really loves doing those books.)  He said, &quot;You know how  kids in school <br/>\nstudy geography?  I think that&#39;s what they call it.   This could be MY <br/>\ngeography book.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nI smiled my agreement and I said, &quot;There is a lot about geography in  those <br/>\nbooks.&quot;  Then he said something that made me sad.  He said, &quot;I  just want to be <br/>\nsmart, and so I&#39;d like this to be my geography.&quot;   <br/>\n<br/>\nI said, &quot;Will, you ARE smart.  You know many things that kids in  school <br/>\ndon&#39;t know and never have a chance to learn.&quot;  I explained about how  school <br/>\ndivides things into subjects like geography and history and social  studies.  But <br/>\nthat life is not really like that, that everything&#39;s mixed up  together and <br/>\nthey teach that way in schools to make it easier to test the kids,  and that&#39;s <br/>\nwhy we get the idea that what&#39;s in the book is what is the most  important thing <br/>\nto know, because that&#39;s what will be on the test.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAnd I said, &quot;There&#39;s geography all around in lots of the things  you do.  <br/>\nThink about how much you know about different cities and states  just because you <br/>\nknow about their baseball teams.&quot;  Well, that just lit him  up in a way I <br/>\nrarely see, so I went on, &quot;You can learn so many things that kids  learn in <br/>\nschool just by learning about MLB:  math, geography, history...and  you could write <br/>\nabout it, too.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nOn another day after that we were in the car and the New York book was with  <br/>\nus, and we got to talk some more about how much is to be gained  from books <br/>\nand how much is to be gained in the experiences that we&#39;ve had,  and he&#39;s lucky <br/>\nto be able to do both.  We&#39;re going to be gone for 3 weeks  on our way to and <br/>\nfrom the conference and there&#39;s no way we could get all that  experience from <br/>\nbooks.  We talked about connections we make and how he can  relate almost <br/>\neverything in his life back to baseball, and probably always will  be able to.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI need to tell him about hooks and his &quot;model of the universe&quot;, too.   One <br/>\nthing I&#39;ve thought of doing is hanging a fish net on the wall and putting  stuff <br/>\nup there that remind us of connections we&#39;ve made.  (I saw an  artpiece like <br/>\nthat in a movie --&quot;Man of the House&quot;, I think--and I&#39;ve thought of  doing that <br/>\never since.)  We made a giant map of the trip to the conference  and we&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen making connections like crazy since we started it in  May.  These kinds of <br/>\nvisual aids help me and I think they help him by  extension.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSo, I&#39;m having a similar thing going on that you&#39;re having with Lars.   Will <br/>\nis getting it bit by bit, and he readily defends the idea that everyone  <br/>\nshould have a choice about what goes in their head.  But he doesn&#39;t  see how to <br/>\nextrapolate that to the rest of his life, and I think he just doesn&#39;t  have <br/>\nenough experience, yet.  He has zero school experience so he doesn&#39;t  have anything <br/>\nto hook that to, and he is getting the wrong ideas about it,  anyway.  I try <br/>\nto correct those, or at least put them in perspective of the  unschooling <br/>\nlife.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI think Will&#39;s too young at this point to be interested in what&#39;s going on  <br/>\nwith older unschoolers.  No context, I think.  One of his favorite  unschooled <br/>\nteens is starting high school in 2 weeks just so he can play  football.  Max <br/>\nis 15 and had to cut his middle-of-the-back hair to be on  the team.  Will is <br/>\nimpressed with that commitment, and he totally gets the  desire to play sports. <br/>\n But I don&#39;t think he gets what Max had to go  through to make the test score <br/>\nto be put in the grade he wanted to be in.   And I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll get it <br/>\nfor some time.  There&#39;s just no  context.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen it comes up again like it has lately (&quot;geography&quot;), I&#39;ll just keep  <br/>\ntelling him what I think, and expand and expound on that as he gets more  <br/>\nexperience, and give him more hooks for his net.  And then we&#39;ll do some  reading <br/>\nabout what older unschoolers do, too.<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren, sorry this is so long...<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Elizabeth Hill","from":"Elizabeth Hill &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Dilemma","postDate":"1091059249","msgId":20224,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxMDgzRTMxLjUwODAzMDhAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDYuMC4wLjIyLjAuMjAwNDA3MjgxMjMyMjQuMDMxZjNjNDBAc2hhd21haWwuZ3Yuc2hhd2NhYmxlLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDYuMC4wLjIyLjAuMjAwNDA3MjgxMjMyMjQuMDMxZjNjNDBAc2hhd21haWwuZ3Yuc2hhd2NhYmxlLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":20223,"nextInTopic":20225,"prevInTime":20223,"nextInTime":20225,"topicId":20223,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"** that I assume he ll do academic stuff when he wants to learn something (or needs a certain amount of math or reading and writing ability to get into some","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-732796625\">**<br/>\n<br/>\nthat I assume he&#39;ll do academic stuff when he wants to <br/>\nlearn something (or needs a certain amount of math or reading and writing <br/>\nability to get into some program).

Does he assume that it will be horrendously difficult and take years?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat may explain why he&#39;s more worried than you are.  I have to say that I read the John Holt claims that all school mathematics could be learned in three (?) months and the first several times I read that, I didn&#39;t believe it.  (I spent years doing math homework and figured that it was building my brain somehow.)  Over time I came to believe that what Holt claimed was possible was possible, but I denied it at first.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there&#39;s a developmental stage when kids get skeptical about everything that their moms have to say.  For me, when my mom told me that I wasn&#39;t fat as a teen (weighing 140), I just shook my head and figured she had to say really blind, dorky things because she was my mother.  I knew she was not objective, and I figured she was also hopelessly out of touch.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou and I understand, from experience and lengthy discussions that learning something &quot;in context&quot; is different from learning it out of context.  (Especially for those of us who like illustrative examples.)  I realize you can&#39;t really &quot;manuever&quot; him, but IF he ended up in situations with the potential for on the job learning, he would probably learn a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Manuevering him would be a bad idea.  At his age, I think it&#39;d piss him off.  It would p-o me!)<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I have been listening to books on tape recently, while quilting and while doing housework.  I&#39;m enjoying it.  I don&#39;t know if Lars would like it at all, but if he did, I would recommend some books about different learning styles.  The last one I read (which I only read parts of) was _The Myth of Laziness_, by Mel Levine.  (It&#39;s written by a man, not a mom, and he&#39;s a doctor, so maybe &lt;g&gt; Lars would find him credible.)  It&#39;s very accepting of the idea that there are learning differences.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m coming to accept that my kid doesn&#39;t love books the way I do (except read aloud) but he learns a lot from television.  I do tend to believe that Nova is more educational than Ed, Edd and Eddy, but I see some value in even the shrillest cartoons.  A locally produced PBS show, called Real Science (I think) has young teens interviewing different scientists about careers, so it&#39;s the TV show that comes to mind when I think about TV as a form of &quot;career education&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you even seen any of the Standard Deviants videos?  They don&#39;t substitute for a whole semesters course in anything, but they give a fast familiarity with the terminology in a &quot;subject&quot; and maybe take the fear and mystery out of something like Trigonometry or Geology.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would recommend seeing Farenheit 911 for anyone who is a budding filmmaker, just to analyze it and see what makes it powerful.<br/>\n<br/>\nOvertime, now that we have the technology, pictures and moving pictures will replace words on the page as how we communicate.  Lars&#39; is just ahead of his time.  (But his time is rapidly arriving.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy<br/>\n<br/>\nPS  Was the discussion about &quot;who uses calculus -- practically nobody on this list? or a related list?  or did I find it elsewhere?</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Dilemma","postDate":"1091044797","msgId":20223,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYuMC4wLjIyLjAuMjAwNDA3MjgxMjMyMjQuMDMxZjNjNDBAc2hhd21haWwuZ3Yuc2hhd2NhYmxlLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":20224,"prevInTime":20222,"nextInTime":20224,"topicId":20223,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Some background: We ve always unschooled, at least as I understood it at the time.

Except <br/>\nfor the one foray into insisting Lars do phonics to learn to read when he <br/>\nwas 12, and one period when he wanted to go to school and I insisted on <br/>\n&quot;playing school&quot; for a couple of months so he&#39;d know what he was getting <br/>\ninto, his learning has all been his choice. He&#39;s never chosen much that <br/>\nwould be considered academic, but I&#39;ve been fine with that, seeing that <br/>\nlearning was happening even if it didn&#39;t look like school learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince he was 7, he&#39;s been signed up with one of the public school distance <br/>\nlearning programs here in BC. The first 2 years, they just left us <br/>\ncompletely alone, helping only if asked. Then the government wanted &quot;proof&quot; <br/>\nthat learning was taking place, and we had to send them info on what our <br/>\nkids were doing. That was still fine. I wrote anecdotal reports of some of <br/>\nthe stuff we did, and they were happy with it. I kept Lars right out of <br/>\nthat process, never showing him the &quot;report cards&quot; the government insisted <br/>\nthey send us, and not asking him to do anything specific to please &quot;them&quot;. <br/>\nTwo years ago the government wanted more, and after one year of &quot;more&quot; <br/>\n(with me still shielding him from the process)we got out and into a much <br/>\nmore flexible program run by a private unschooling type school. For this <br/>\nprogram we just had to log 25 hours a week of learning, and *anything* counted.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought it was great and was planning to go with the same program for the <br/>\ncoming year. (The plus is $1,000 to spend on almost anything remotely <br/>\neducational. We got him a new computer last year.) Now he&#39;s just asked me <br/>\nif he was going to be doing the same program this year. I told him there <br/>\nwas some question this last week about whether the school was going to <br/>\nallowed to offer the program to high school aged students again this year <br/>\nbecause the government figures they should be offering a diploma, with all <br/>\nthe huge changes to the program that would require. He asked me what would <br/>\nbe wrong with that, because he &quot;hardly did anything last year&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems that the only reason he did anything academic last year was <br/>\nbecause he &quot;had to&quot;. I never told him to do academic things. I just asked <br/>\nhim every day what he *had* done and wrote it down. We counted all his bike <br/>\nriding, all his sports, any movies he watched, anything he read, <br/>\nconversations we had. I really wanted him to see that he was learning all <br/>\nthe time and didn&#39;t need to worry about  &quot;doing stuff&quot; as he calls academic <br/>\nlearning. At one point I asked him to see if he could think of some <br/>\ndifferent things that he was doing anyway that he could write down. It was <br/>\nmore an exercise in seeing the learning happening, at least that&#39;s what I <br/>\nthought at the time.  He did actually do a bunch of academic stuff through <br/>\nthe year, but I thought it was because he was thinking ahead and wanted to <br/>\nbe able to get into whatever program he might want to enter in terms of <br/>\ncareer. (I was thinking trades training, since he had shown so little <br/>\ninterest in any kind of book learning over the years.)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow it seems that he doesn&#39;t believe he&#39;ll do anything without being made <br/>\nto. I tried to point out how hard he works on all his sports stuff, because <br/>\nhe wants to, and that I assume he&#39;ll do academic stuff when he wants to <br/>\nlearn something (or needs a certain amount of math or reading and writing <br/>\nability to get into some program). He still doesn&#39;t believe that the <br/>\nmotivation can come from within. He clearly doesn&#39;t see unschooling the way <br/>\nI do, and I don&#39;t know how to help him understand it. I&#39;m not sure where to <br/>\ngo from here. Any thoughts?<br/>\nTia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67419,"nextTopicId":67522}}
