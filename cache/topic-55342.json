There are always big big clues kids<br/>\ndrop just before the storm hits. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, these clues are not big. If you&#39;ve been around tons of noise<br/>\nand motion most of your life in the midst of family, you may not pay<br/>\nattention to it when you&#39;re an adult. It&#39;s just swirl. I think it&#39;s a<br/>\npersonality thing to be aware or unaware of whether someone is yawning<br/>\nor droopy. Or spazzy in need of protein. Kids grow soooo fast and they<br/>\nget hungry it seems incredibly suddenly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not easy for me to see these things unless Karl is practically in<br/>\nmy lap or leaning on me or something like that. He does that a lot<br/>\n(not all kids do) and so I&#39;m lucky. The kind of fighting that he does<br/>\nis almost always physical not verbal at all except as noise. I was the<br/>\nsame way. Fights were never about disagreement but feeling and the<br/>\nfact that they usually include words doesn&#39;t mean the fight is about<br/>\nideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nI almost always go for the protein first, sometimes without even<br/>\nasking because once Karl gets that sudden hunger + anger thing, he<br/>\nisn&#39;t coherent enough for making decisions about what to eat or if he<br/>\neven wants to. I just offer it and see if he takes it. Well over half<br/>\nthe time, he wants food. The other times he just wants a change of<br/>\nscenery. I have so many things laying about ready to go to, not being<br/>\nmuch on putting them away, the kind of person who wants to see what I<br/>\nhave ... so I feel lucky there too.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sun, Jun 27, 2010 at 9:58 PM, Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; -=6.

She <br/>\nwants to know that mom will step in and support her - completely and <br/>\nabsolutely. She has a clue that maybe mom has divided loyalties and that <br/>\nscares her and infuriates her.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - she starts out just annoyed or frustrated by the younger sibling, <br/>\nbut when mom steps in and tries to mediate between them, the older child <br/>\ngets extremely angry at mom for not 100 percent supporting her against <br/>\nthe intruder.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe if mom simply grasps how it feels/seems to the older child when <br/>\nshe tries to get her to compromise, that will change the dynamics. Don&#39;t <br/>\ntry to get her to share. Don&#39;t expect her to see from the younger <br/>\nchild&#39;s perspective. Instead, help her develop very specific skills for <br/>\nhow to handle the little intruder &lt;g&gt;. For example, Roya would ask if we <br/>\ncould give Roxana a popsicle. Or she&#39;d ask, &quot;Can Roxana take a bath <br/>\nnow?&quot;  She&#39;d learned that those were the kinds of things I did when the <br/>\ntwo of them were having trouble getting along - I&#39;d find something else <br/>\nfor one of them to do that was more appealing. Since Roxana was littler <br/>\nand more distractable, usually it meant I enticed her away. But <br/>\nsometimes I would offer Roya the chance to do something she&#39;d been <br/>\nwanting -- &quot;How about we go bake those brownies now?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI gave Roya what seemed at the time a LOT of sympathy for the <br/>\ninconveniences of having a younger sister. And I didn&#39;t try to make it <br/>\nseem my time and attention was equally divided - because a nursing baby <br/>\njust really gets a LOT. So what I did was make my relationship with Roya <br/>\na super high priority  and made us a team. I shared my thoughts about <br/>\nthe baby with her as in, &quot;I wonder what she thinks about, what do you <br/>\nthink?&quot; or &quot;I wonder what she&#39;s going to be like when she gets older, <br/>\nwhat do you think?&quot; or &quot;Do you think she&#39;d like it if we sang some songs <br/>\nto her?&quot; I made Roya and I very clearly a team and made it clear that <br/>\nher role as a big sister was very important and something special <br/>\nbetween us. And I made sure we had plenty of time without the baby or <br/>\ntoddler, too, so that I&#39;d not be distracted and could focus on her. I&#39;d <br/>\nleave Roxana home with my husband for an hour or two and take Roya with <br/>\nme to get a bite to eat or to have ice cream or even just go to the <br/>\n99cent store or the library or the do-it-yourself car wash. Maybe I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t manage to do that every single day - but really often.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd - a really really important part of this is lots of direct eye <br/>\ncontact and physical contact.

They get along great most of the time and she wants to play with her sister.  She really seems to enjoy her over all.  If anyone is tagging along it&#39;s the 2 year old, because she has been easier, calmer, quieter since the day she was born.  I spend more one on one time and over all interaction time with my older one because she is by far more high needs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe example I gave happened to involve her sister, but I could give many other examples just from this week that have nothing to do with her sister.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here are some ideas of things to do with young children.

Don&#39;t expect her to hang out with you and  <br/>\n&gt; the baby, as a third party to your romance with the baby.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The 2 year old doesn&#39;t hang out with me.  Unless she is nursing or needs something from me like food or water or diaper change, she is happy to do her own thing or hang out with her sister all day long.  Of course I *do* engage them both and play with them throughout the day, but it is my 4 year old who needs (and gets) way more attention.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;  From the way you&#39;re writing about her, it seems you&#39;re tired of her.   <br/>\n&gt; You&#39;re saying &quot;every day&quot; and &quot;fight&quot; as though she&#39;s a constant  <br/>\n&gt; disruption.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am tired.  I am tired and frustrated and not being the fun, sparkly, engaged mom I would like to be.  I have been on survival mode all week.  My husband went from being with us the majority of both days to working 16 hour days for 9 days in a row.

She missed her daddy and I have not been as available to her.  But this has been going on, in various frequencies for years, escalating the last few months and now happening multiple times a day this last week, so it&#39;s not *just* about the circumstances this week, though I know they are contributing.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; She needs you to make her life interesting, sparkly, memorable.   <br/>\n&gt; Memorable for good things, not bad things.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This sound wonderful and it&#39;s what I need to do and what I want to do.

To literally go out the door and walk away from all that other stuff so I could give Eric my full attention made me a better mom for the afternoon.<br/>\n<br/>\nEric has always struggled with wanting things to be his own way, and with what I think of as getting &quot;on rails,&quot; starting an action and having a really hard time turning away from it even if someone is asking him to stop. This has been one of the major causes of kid fights and Eric tantrums. One of the ways we dealt with it was by giving him as much control over things as possible. For instance, if I felt like I was getting into the kind of space the OP mentioned--where it felt like I was just struggling with him all the time--I&#39;d take us out of the house to, say, the zoo, and just let Eric make the decisions: what animal to see next, how long to stay at exhibits, when to stop for ice cream. This can be done with a baby along, in a stroller or sling, because the baby doesn&#39;t care if we go to the penguins or the rhino next! Setting aside some time for us to remember how much we enjoy each other, in a place where that can happen more easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of times when I&#39;m stuck in a &quot;kids are driving me crazy&quot; stage, I get focused on how I want _them_ to change. But often there are things _I_ can do to defuse conflict. And, of course, avoiding it in the first place can be key. It&#39;s not always possible, but if there are patterns you can learn to recognize you can step in and shape events before things go bad. For instance, Carl has a stretch of time in the late afternoon, starting around 5, when he is really easily frustrated, combative, whiny. Sometimes if I can step in around 4:30 and start steering him away from frustrating situations, it can really help. For instance, it&#39;s a bad time for a friend to be over; a pre-emptive snack often helps; it&#39;s a good time to help him settle with a video game or movie or, if I&#39;m not hung up cooking or something, a board game or activity with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe OP said:<br/>\n<br/>\n***  She kept running into me and I kept pushing her back (not hard, just away from me) because the only other option was to hold her and restrain her.  By that point I was angry and I ended up pushing her too hard and she fell and got hurt. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d have gotten angry, too. It&#39;s one of my failings as a parent, and something I keep working on. But Danielle C. used to talk on lists about &quot;being a mountain&quot; when her son was having tantrums, just trying to be this big solid presence. It&#39;s an image of strength, and patience, and endurance, and of accepting the moment as it is. I&#39;ve never mastered it, but my attempts to invoke that kind of &quot;I&#39;m a great big patient unmoving rock and I&#39;m OK with how things are this minute and I know the energy is going to shift in a new direction soon&quot; have definitely *helped*.<br/>\n<br/>\nI doubt your daughter wants to fight, really, but she may have the kind of trouble Eric does with turning away from an object or action he has his sights on. It sounds kind of similar. We did a lot of things that helped when he was younger, but in a lot of ways improvement with him has been developmental; 7 was huge, 9 has been huge again in terms of big developmental leaps and improved self-understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve realized I was expecting my kids to be more flexible and patient than I was expecting myself to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu, mom to Eric, 9; Carl, 6; Yehva, 2.5<br/>\ntapeflags.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":301108410,"authorName":"Marina DeLuca-Howard","from":"Marina DeLuca-Howard &lt;delucahoward@...&gt;","profile":"matedgirl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Fighting","postDate":"1277691823","msgId":55356,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlsd2Y4bGdXVi1obmVyelR5UWhPbEg0aFV3UWtsMkEzVDRDYWFyUkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEUwNjA5NTExLUU2RDQtNDM1OS04MzNCLUQ1NTJFOTI2QUNEM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGkwOGpycys5cms2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8aTA4cnVjK2xuYWlAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+CTxBQU5Ma1RpbDhaekFfMTdpSWhGTXFYUzVJR2lQaWc1ZDF0SFBETUh5d0N0SEpAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+CTxFMDYwOTUxMS1FNkQ0LTQzNTktODMzQi1ENTUyRTkyNkFDRDNAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":55354,"nextInTopic":55359,"prevInTime":55355,"nextInTime":55357,"topicId":55342,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" My kids drop","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-10956607\">&lt;&lt;-=6.

She fights with me over things and she will.not.stop until she ends up getting hurt.  Here&#39;s an example:<br/>\n<br/>\nHer and her 2 year old sister were playing in the wagon.  It has a little door and she wanted it closed and her sister wanted it open so they were fighting over it.  I intervened and tried talking about ways we could solve the problem.  Set a timer?  Take turns?  I asked her if she had any ideas too.  But she could hardly hear my suggestions because the whole time she is trying to push me out of the way to get to the door to close it.  I am trying to keep her away from it so the girls aren&#39;t fighting while we find a solution.  She would NOT stop for even a second to try to figure something else out.  She got more and more intent on closing the door to the point where she is pushing me, running into me, hitting me, just fighting with everything she has to get the door.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBy that point, it knew it wasn&#39;t about the door.  It&#39;s about the FIGHT.  She does this every day over random things.  So I quit trying to give her ideas to solve the door problem and instead said, &quot;Right now I need to keep you away from you sister until you calm down.&quot;  And I tried to help her calm down.  But nothing worked!  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter trying to get her some water, holding her in a bear hug, seeing if she wanted to push on my hands (helps with frustration sometimes) or throw a stuffed animal, tried to let her have some space in her room, I finally ended up just sitting on the floor between her and her sister with my hands out to stop her from getting to her sister.  She kept running into me and I kept pushing her back (not hard, just away from me) because the only other option was to hold her and restrain her.  By that point I was angry and I ended up pushing her too hard and she fell and got hurt. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen she stopped.<br/>\n<br/>\nI held her and comforted her while she cried and apologized for pushing her.  When she calmed down, her sister was done with the wagon and I said, &quot;There you go, it&#39;s your turn now!&quot;  She said, &quot;No, I don&#39;t want to play with it.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to scream YOU JUST FOUGHT ME OVER IT FOR LIKE 20 MINUTES AND NOW YOU DON&#39;T WANT IT?!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis goes on every day lately!  She doesn&#39;t stop until she gets hurt.  I try really, really hard to use every technique I know how to keep my cool, help her solve the problem, help her calm down, but it&#39;s like she wants to fight with me.  I just don&#39;t understand!  And almost every time, she ends up getting hurt because we are fighting and she will end up falling down, tripping, or I will accidentally hurt her while trying to restrain her to keep her from hurting me or her sister.  I feel really bad when she gets hurt and I don&#39;t know what to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmily</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55422,"nextTopicId":55337}}
