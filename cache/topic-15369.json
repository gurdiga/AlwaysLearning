That&#39;s progress.<br/>\n&gt; DWSO21:  yeah.  Although it still works.  Anne & I were in Walgreens a couple<br/>\n&gt; of months ago buying cheap sunglasses, and when we were trying to check out,<br/>\n&gt; a guy who had just finished buying stuff walked out the door and the alarm<br/>\n&gt; went off.<br/>\n&gt; SandraDodd:  Marty&#39;s saying you could get a hippie on the ground with tear<br/>\n&gt; gas.

Maybe  a third of an inch.<br/>\n&gt; DWSO21:  So, HE&#39;S the hippie now!<br/>\n&gt; SandraDodd:  We stopped by Active after the ceremony while he was still in<br/>\n&gt; uniform.  He put his cap back on, and we showed off his class photo (with<br/>\n&gt; instructors, in front of the helicopter) and his certificates.<br/>\n&gt; SandraDodd:  AND Top Gun came with $15 gift certificate to Oshman&#39;s.<br/>\n&gt; SandraDodd:  So you know how many paint balls that will buy?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; DWSO21:  Nice!<br/>\n&gt; SandraDodd:  HARDLY ANY.<br/>\n&gt; DWSO21:  I was about to say, &quot;probably about 3.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; SandraDodd:  But wait.  I was going to tell you the best part and got<br/>\n&gt; sidetracked with all this chit chat.<br/>\n&gt; DWSO21:  Tell me the best part!<br/>\n&gt; SandraDodd:  After the dinner they fed us (Quarters barbecue stuff, served up<br/>\n&gt; by some of their meanest instructors &lt;g&gt;), I went to sit with the<br/>\n&gt; coordinator/spokesman of the whole thing, and I thanked him and told him<br/>\n&gt; Marty had a<br/>\n&gt; great time.<br/>\n&gt; DWSO21:  and then?<br/>\n&gt; SandraDodd:  He told me Marty was great to work with.<br/>\n&gt; SandraDodd:  And in the course of our both saying nice things about Marty, he<br/>\n&gt; said &quot;You can always tell when a kid comes from a home with a lot of<br/>\n&gt; discipline and rules.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; DWSO21:  ...and then you told him Marty&#39;s never been to school in his life,<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t you?<br/>\n&gt; DWSO21:  hee hee!<br/>\n&gt; DWSO21:  That&#39;s a riot!<br/>\n&gt; SandraDodd:  I told him that Monday had been Marty&#39;s first day of school of<br/>\n&gt; any sort.<br/>\n&gt; DWSO21:  what did he say next?<br/>\n&gt; SandraDodd:  And that when he got home he had re-written his notes.  It was<br/>\n&gt; the first time he had ever taken notes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It was four gun safety rules and the names of all the instructors.<br/>\n&gt; SandraDodd:  &quot;Good.  Initiative! &quot;  He said.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I told him we hardly have ANY rules at our house, we just tell them to make<br/>\n&gt; good choices that don&#39;t hurt people.<br/>\n&gt; DWSO21:  And then he said, &quot;on the ground, hippie!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; SandraDodd:  He said the homeschoolers he&#39;s met haven&#39;t tended to be very<br/>\n&gt; outgoing but Marty was (I forget what he said)<br/>\n&gt; SandraDodd:  That would have been the time to do it.   Except he was all<br/>\n&gt; a-glow from luv of Marty.<br/>\n&gt; DWSO21:  That&#39;s SO cool!<br/>\n&gt; SandraDodd:  I&#39;ll just show you the videos when you get a chance.  Two short<br/>\n&gt; news things and a five minute summary video (nicely put together!  we get a<br/>\n&gt; free copy for providing a blank tape)<br/>\n&gt; DWSO21:  Aren&#39;t you afraid, though, that being a cop will wreck Marty&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; naturally sunny disposition?<br/>\n&gt; DWSO21:  I want to see it.<br/>\n&gt; SandraDodd:  Yeah.  He might not become a cop.  But it will be cop<br/>\n&gt; appreciation.  Like when you are learning to play an instrument and quit,<br/>\n&gt; but still<br/>\n&gt; afterwards you know what&#39;s good and what&#39;s not when you hear people playing<br/>\n </span></blockquote>one.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; SandraDodd:  Oh!  They did a crime scene for them too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; They set up a room with clues and a storyline and the kids went in and found<br/>\n&gt; the right clues, in groups.<br/>\n&gt; SandraDodd:  He had a lot of fun with that.<br/>\n&gt; DWSO21:  Anne wants info on the Junior Cop thing, so she can do it next year.<br/>\n&gt; SandraDodd:  And they visited the forensics lab (right across the parking<br/>\n&gt; lot) and the guy showed them real crime scene photos.  They said &quot;Dead body!&quot;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; he said &quot;if you&#39;re good.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; DWSO21:  and were they good?<br/>\n&gt; SandraDodd:  Age limit is 12-14.  this was Marty&#39;s last opportunity.  I am SO<br/>\n&gt; glad I ran across it!! Thrilled.<br/>\n&gt; DWSO21:  Did they see the dead body?<br/>\n&gt; SandraDodd:  He showed them a body after while.  Drug murder, at a party, and<br/>\n&gt; let them figure out why the blood pooled as it did.  How was he when he was<br/>\n&gt; first shot, and then how did he move (or did someone else move him) after a<br/>\n&gt; while.  (photo)<br/>\n&gt; SandraDodd:  But one of the first ones was a kitchen.  &quot;See anything?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;bullet hole in the linoleum.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Anything else?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Marty said he said &quot;That floor does NOT  go well with that wall.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ordinarily wise cracks were not being made, because they&#39;d make them do<br/>\n&gt; pushups, but they had been left with a nice lab guy who wasn&#39;t into that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So he said<br/>\n&gt; SandraDodd:  &quot;If this were a fashion class, you&#39;d be right.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; SandraDodd:  And then he showed a second set of photos.  They spray something<br/>\n&gt; on the floor and then photographic it under black light and blood showed up<br/>\n&gt; all over that floor and in the hall, and on the side of the sink.<br/>\n&gt; SandraDodd:  So if you&#39;re going to mop up a crime scene.  REALLY rinse.<br/>\n&gt; Maybe use hydrogen peroxide.   Rinse and repeat FOR SURE.<br/>\n&gt; DWSO21:  Good to know!<br/>\n&gt; SandraDodd:  Lest they bring in dogs and teargas, hippie!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

Maybe  a third of an inch.<br/>\nDWSO21:  So, HE&#39;S the hippie now! <br/>\nSandraDodd:  We stopped by Active after the ceremony while he was still in <br/>\nuniform.  He put his cap back on, and we showed off his class photo (with <br/>\ninstructors, in front of the helicopter) and his certificates.<br/>\nSandraDodd:  AND Top Gun came with $15 gift certificate to Oshman&#39;s.<br/>\nSandraDodd:  So you know how many paint balls that will buy? <br/>\n<br/>\nDWSO21:  Nice!<br/>\nSandraDodd:  HARDLY ANY.<br/>\nDWSO21:  I was about to say, &quot;probably about 3.&quot;<br/>\nSandraDodd:  But wait.  I was going to tell you the best part and got <br/>\nsidetracked with all this chit chat.<br/>\nDWSO21:  Tell me the best part!<br/>\nSandraDodd:  After the dinner they fed us (Quarters barbecue stuff, served up <br/>\nby some of their meanest instructors &lt;g&gt;), I went to sit with the <br/>\ncoordinator/spokesman of the whole thing, and I thanked him and told him Marty had a <br/>\ngreat time.<br/>\nDWSO21:  and then?<br/>\nSandraDodd:  He told me Marty was great to work with.<br/>\nSandraDodd:  And in the course of our both saying nice things about Marty, he <br/>\nsaid &quot;You can always tell when a kid comes from a home with a lot of <br/>\ndiscipline and rules.&quot;<br/>\nDWSO21:  ...and then you told him Marty&#39;s never been to school in his life, <br/>\ndidn&#39;t you?<br/>\nDWSO21:  hee hee!<br/>\nDWSO21:  That&#39;s a riot!<br/>\nSandraDodd:  I told him that Monday had been Marty&#39;s first day of school of <br/>\nany sort.<br/>\nDWSO21:  what did he say next?<br/>\nSandraDodd:  And that when he got home he had re-written his notes.  It was <br/>\nthe first time he had ever taken notes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was four gun safety rules and the names of all the instructors.<br/>\nSandraDodd:  &quot;Good.  Initiative! &quot;  He said.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told him we hardly have ANY rules at our house, we just tell them to make <br/>\ngood choices that don&#39;t hurt people.  <br/>\nDWSO21:  And then he said, &quot;on the ground, hippie!&quot;<br/>\nSandraDodd:  He said the homeschoolers he&#39;s met haven&#39;t tended to be very <br/>\noutgoing but Marty was (I forget what he said)<br/>\nSandraDodd:  That would have been the time to do it.   Except he was all <br/>\na-glow from luv of Marty.<br/>\nDWSO21:  That&#39;s SO cool!<br/>\nSandraDodd:  I&#39;ll just show you the videos when you get a chance.  Two short <br/>\nnews things and a five minute summary video (nicely put together!  we get a <br/>\nfree copy for providing a blank tape)<br/>\nDWSO21:  Aren&#39;t you afraid, though, that being a cop will wreck Marty&#39;s <br/>\nnaturally sunny disposition?<br/>\nDWSO21:  I want to see it.<br/>\nSandraDodd:  Yeah.  He might not become a cop.  But it will be cop <br/>\nappreciation.  Like when you are learning to play an instrument and quit, but still <br/>\nafterwards you know what&#39;s good and what&#39;s not when you hear people playing one.<br/>\nSandraDodd:  Oh!  They did a crime scene for them too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey set up a room with clues and a storyline and the kids went in and found <br/>\nthe right clues, in groups.<br/>\nSandraDodd:  He had a lot of fun with that.<br/>\nDWSO21:  Anne wants info on the Junior Cop thing, so she can do it next year.<br/>\nSandraDodd:  And they visited the forensics lab (right across the parking <br/>\nlot) and the guy showed them real crime scene photos.  They said &quot;Dead body!&quot; and <br/>\nhe said &quot;if you&#39;re good.&quot;<br/>\nDWSO21:  and were they good?<br/>\nSandraDodd:  Age limit is 12-14.  this was Marty&#39;s last opportunity.  I am SO <br/>\nglad I ran across it!! Thrilled.<br/>\nDWSO21:  Did they see the dead body?<br/>\nSandraDodd:  He showed them a body after while.  Drug murder, at a party, and <br/>\nlet them figure out why the blood pooled as it did.  How was he when he was <br/>\nfirst shot, and then how did he move (or did someone else move him) after a <br/>\nwhile.  (photo)<br/>\nSandraDodd:  But one of the first ones was a kitchen.  &quot;See anything?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;bullet hole in the linoleum.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Anything else?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty said he said &quot;That floor does NOT  go well with that wall.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOrdinarily wise cracks were not being made, because they&#39;d make them do <br/>\npushups, but they had been left with a nice lab guy who wasn&#39;t into that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he said<br/>\nSandraDodd:  &quot;If this were a fashion class, you&#39;d be right.&quot;<br/>\nSandraDodd:  And then he showed a second set of photos.  They spray something <br/>\non the floor and then photographic it under black light and blood showed up <br/>\nall over that floor and in the hall, and on the side of the sink.<br/>\nSandraDodd:  So if you&#39;re going to mop up a crime scene.  REALLY rinse.  <br/>\nMaybe use hydrogen peroxide.   Rinse and repeat FOR SURE.<br/>\nDWSO21:  Good to know!<br/>\nSandraDodd:  Lest they bring in dogs and teargas, hippie!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15368,"nextTopicId":15375}}
