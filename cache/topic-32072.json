I&#39;m glad you liked it. I found it fascinating. When we were watching it, my dh remembered a couple of the items advertised from when was a kid living in Taiwan for a few years. It was interesting at the end of the movie how they listed all the items that were actual products, etc.<br/>\n  I have to say, I&#39;m saddened but not surprised that not wanting to go to school is considered a disorder. I know I&#39;ve heard the term &#39;school refusal&#39; before. Not sure when, where or in what context though. &#39;School refusal&#39; is probably a sign of high intelligence &lt;g&gt;. <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMeghan<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I can create what I can imagine. ~ Charlene Kingston <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nNever miss a thing.
