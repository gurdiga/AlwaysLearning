We&#39;re outside of Boston.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have some time on my hands, so, in theory, I&#39;m trying to get some work <br/>\ndone, and do some stuff in the house. So far I&#39;ve mostly played online and <br/>\nplayed The Sims. Beth and I REALLY missed the dibbun last night. <br/>\n<br/>\nJulian&#39;s dad has had a revelation, though. After many months of mostly <br/>\nplaying computer games (and complicating the lives of those around him, but <br/>\nthat&#39;s another story), and years of insisting that HE&#39;S not the one <br/>\nhomeschooling  (except for panics and demands for more structured work on the <br/>\npart of Julian), Perry has realized that Learning is Interesting and Fun! We <br/>\nhad a marvelous conversation about art, politics, life, etc. He wanted to <br/>\nshare all this with Julian, and was very open when I suggested that he share <br/>\nthem as things he&#39;s interested in, rather than trying to &quot;teach&quot; Julian. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf this takes, Julian will be a very happy Junior Marine Biologist.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn, who with Beth, is VERY jealous of Julian&#39;s week, and also misses him <br/>\nvery much<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8152,"nextTopicId":8149}}
