Even as a young child I<br/>\nwas very appreciative of her willingness to expend the effort to keep me<br/>\ncomfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nLoose is an important suggestion.   Also for &quot;bottoms&quot; it sometimes helps to<br/>\nhave overalls or coveralls so that there is nothing suspended from the<br/>\nwaist.   Jeans may be tight all over as well as stiff  and sweatpants are an<br/>\nimprovement but can still be irritating.   &quot;Sagging&quot; pants is not always<br/>\njust a fashion statement,  it can be more comfortable.    Overalls can keep<br/>\nthe belly warm without irritating the waist and still allow plenty of<br/>\nfreedom of movement  so that squatting, etc. is comfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thrilled when tagless t-shirts came out.  The downside of cutting out<br/>\ntags (besides leaving a rough strip or holes in the neck binding if not done<br/>\nvery carefully)  was losing the size marking.   Laundry markers or even<br/>\npermanent sharpies will last for  dozens of launderings.  Marking the size<br/>\ninstead of the owner&#39;s name or initial works better when items are  &quot;passed<br/>\ndown&quot; or shared.   But the tagless shirts were absolutely best, the size<br/>\nmarking stays visible with no maintenance and for longer than even if the<br/>\ntag were left on.   I had teens by the time they were introduced in adult<br/>\nsizes.   Do they come in small children&#39;s sizes now?    Are they available<br/>\non more than sports uniforms, tshirts, or tank tops?<br/>\n<br/>\nYour comment about multiple layers made me think of something we used to<br/>\nsay................it was from a movie or book or something,  I&#39;ll bet<br/>\nSandra can pull up the source!.     Had to do with knit briefs becoming<br/>\npopular (before the day of boxer briefs....anyone remember when boxers did<br/>\nnot have elastic waists?)  and calling boxers &quot;Indian Drawers&quot;.    Some boys<br/>\npreferred tighty whities to boxers because the boxers tend to &quot;sneak up on<br/>\nyou&quot;.   Very politically incorrect language but one of those shorthand terms<br/>\nthat was pretty widespread in certain decades.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if only I could find a satisfactory replacement for the underwear for ME<br/>\nthat I finally found but when I went back to stock up were no longer<br/>\navailable :-(   :-(.<br/>\n<br/>\nvicki<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 1/19/08, Deb Lewis &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:d.lewis@...\">d.lewis@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   **<br/>\n&gt; Try boxers or no underwear at all, sometimes those multiple layers rub or<br/>\n&gt; bunch or flap and feel weird.

Kinda like how your body<br/>\nfeels not-quite-like-home during a sudden weight change or growth spurt,<br/>\nuntil your brain figures out where your balance and your extremities are? So<br/>\nwe did the same things with him that I did to deal with it when I was<br/>\npregnant... we did a lot of skin brushing (basically just gently stroking<br/>\nthe skin with a soft brush, which feels really good and reminds your nerves<br/>\nwhere your skin is), lots of time soaking in the tub, and some<br/>\ncranial-sacral adjustments (to make sure all the bits are communicating<br/>\nideally with all the other bits; if you have a nerve pinch or restriction or<br/>\nsomething, your body can give you weird messages about itself). Every time<br/>\nhe&#39;d have a big growth spurt, the sensitivity thing would re-emerge, and<br/>\nwe&#39;d go through the routine. Interestingly, he&#39;s figured out at this point<br/>\nthat doing yoga with me seems to also help him re-establish coordination<br/>\nwhen he&#39;s just changed shape really fast.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not to say that there aren&#39;t types of clothing he hates. He&#39;s super<br/>\nsensitive to the smallest amount of wool content, and what the heck is it<br/>\nabout people who make kids clothes with those huge hunkin irritating sharp<br/>\ntags in them???

He says every <br/>\npair of pants and/or underwear hurts him.  I&#39;ve looked all over his lower body and cannot <br/>\nfind ANYTHING that would cause the clothes to be uncomfortable - no rashes, bruises, <br/>\nscratches, bumps - NOTHING.  And yet trying to get him into a clean pair of underwear <br/>\nand/or pants can take up to an hour and involves a lot of crying, whining, etc. (on both <br/>\nour parts).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI really believe this is all in his head, because once I can get him into a pair of pants or <br/>\npajama bottoms and he wears it for a little while, he is fine and then doesn&#39;t want to <br/>\nchange out of them into anything else.  I&#39;ve given up on trying to get him dressed and am <br/>\njust letting him wear his pajamas every day and night.  But...he needs to at least change <br/>\nhis underwear (yes - he *does* need to!).  I have no problem with taking him out in his <br/>\npajamas, but HE does.  He doesn&#39;t want to leave the house, because he&#39;s embarrased <br/>\nabout wearing his pajamas, but there is no one at home to leave him with, and I have <br/>\nresponsibilites outside the house that need to be met.  Plus, after several days, his <br/>\npajamas are very dirty and need to be washed...<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone dealt with something similar?  I&#39;m trying hard to be sensitive to whatever this <br/>\nis that he&#39;s going thru - being willing to take my kids out in pajamas is a *huge* step for <br/>\nme, as is letting him wear pajamas day in and day out.  But I don&#39;t know what else to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nTami</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31876,"nextTopicId":31881}}
