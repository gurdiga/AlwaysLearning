That s been my","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1944572126\">When he was little, people use to comment on his curiosity and intelligence a lot.  It seems we are coming back into the upswing of this theory. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s been my experience.  There is this age between 9 and 12 where kids in elementary and middle school seem to be doing and learning more.  The mulitiplication tables was a big trigger thing.<br/>\nMy experience with Chamille, is that she was doing way different things than all those kids in school, now at the age of 15, she knows similar things as they do, but more, and more personal, for more personal reasons.<br/>\nShe may not know math language or other formal schoolish things, but she does know how to figure things out in her head.  You could take any subject that is in school and I could tell you a way in which Chamille has been exposed to the same kinds of information.  Through exposure, she&#39;s been able to learn things.  Of course, unlike school, everything she&#39;s been exposed to she&#39;s learned from.  I find that school kids often tune these things out.<br/>\nNow that she is a bit older, what she does, looks NOTHING like school, yet her knowledge is profound and meaningful.  There is very little to compare to with school, contrast maybe, but for comparison sake there is little similarity.<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to encounter doubt in unschooling, yet, if you can get past it, by the time your kid is a teen, it&#39;s easy to relax.  Especially if you look around and get to know other school kids, who struggle with school pressure and peer pressure and parent pressure.  I can look at Chamille and see that she is relaxed about herself and confident in what she DOES know, that the things she struggles with are avoidable or workable.  She&#39;s not stuck in her thinking or her life.  When she encounters things that upset her, it&#39;s usually about someone else&#39;s misery, not her own.<br/>\n. <br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: When unschoolers do seem to be &quot;behind&quot;","postDate":"1252518755","msgId":47200,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY4NDQzQkU2LTZDQkUtNDA4Ni1BMEVELTdDMTFBN0I1Q0MwRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGg4OG5ycCt0bHVhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGg4OG5ycCt0bHVhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47199,"nextInTopic":47201,"prevInTime":47199,"nextInTime":47201,"topicId":47175,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Joanna, that was perfect and I ll save it.

The literature is aimed at adults.  I looked at the<br/>\nbill and winced--it seemed like a lot of money.  I pictured myself reading<br/>\nfishing information out loud for days on end.

I don&#39;t enjoy fishing, but I love my son very much and vowed to sit<br/>\nand read with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course the other day I sat next to Marty while he read to *me* all about<br/>\nBrook Trout from one of his fishing guides--fluently and unhesitatingly.  He<br/>\nis turning ten soon and he wants more fishing equipment, so he knows all the<br/>\nprices and is comparing numbers to find the best deals.  He then showed me<br/>\nsome maps and explained he wanted to take a fishing trip next year as a<br/>\nfamily.  After our conversation was over I realized he had done in one week<br/>\nquite joyfully: what would have taken years of pain at school.  His reading<br/>\nhad taken off, he was doing math with large numbers, and plotting routes on<br/>\nmaps all with an excited smile on his face.
