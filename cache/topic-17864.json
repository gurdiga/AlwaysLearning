I am in homeschool group here in Atlanta.  <br/>\nThe sole purpose of our groups is that we are homeschoolers, nothing <br/>\nelse.  However, everyone is pretty well represented unschoolers (not <br/>\nas many) school at homers, eclectic, republicans, democrats, <br/>\ncatholics, protestants, new agers, atheists etc.  It&#39;s cool.  I love <br/>\nit.  Interestingly, thought, all of these people who are seemingly so <br/>\ndifferent except that they homeschool are also attachment parenting <br/>\ntypes.  We all had slinged babies, co-sleeping longterm nurslings.  <br/>\nExcept then there comes this point where there were attachment <br/>\nparents who were very into the whole granola-wholewheat-anti war toys-<br/>\ntv-videogames-whatever.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was a new waver in the 80s. Purple hair, leather mini skirts, <br/>\nlistening to The Smiths and New Order etc...I hung out mostly with <br/>\nthe non conformist types.  But I also wore crew neck sweaters, kilts <br/>\nand my beloved Bass weejuns (still my signature shoe).  I couldn&#39;t <br/>\nstick to just one thing, or one group.  What&#39;s funny is that I still <br/>\nmarch to the beat of a different drummer and it seems upsetting to <br/>\npeople. For example since I <br/>\nnursed my 2 older kids til they were 5 (and the 4 year old is still <br/>\ngoing)  <br/>\nthat I shouldn&#39;t let them have toy guns or play video games, or eat <br/>\njunk food; and other &quot;mainstream types&quot; who see how normal my kids <br/>\nmay seem are equally as flipped out when they find out how long they <br/>\nwere all nursed. Or that <br/>\nthey shouldn&#39;t eat marshmallow fluff (I had an attachnment friend <br/>\nchew me out once for Fluff.  I thought it was funny.) Later all the <br/>\nmoms went out to dinner (homeschooling moms) and everyone was talking <br/>\nabout this diet and that, what natural foods to eat (and Hey, Whole <br/>\nFoods is my favorite store, because I am a Foodie, but I love Burger <br/>\nKing too) and they asked me, and I said I had been there done that, <br/>\nand that life is too short to be constantly freaking out about the <br/>\nfood I eat. They were horrified.  All desperate to keep up with each <br/>\nothers attempts at whole-food healthiness. An appearances <br/>\nthing...totally!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is if one is really a non conformist, then conforming to <br/>\nthe non-conforming groups still makes you a conformist.  Someone who <br/>\nreally thinks for themselves is always going to be a pariah in any if <br/>\nthere groups because they will never exactly fit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember walking with my Mom once, (at 16 or 17) and seeing this <br/>\ngirl who was wearing some cool outfit. Her outfit told you what group <br/>\nshe was in...a very definite style. I said, &quot;Mom, I wish I had a <br/>\nstyle. I feel like I don&#39;t have something that says this is me.&quot;  She <br/>\ntold me that I was lucky.  That I had this amazing ability to blend <br/>\ninto whatever was interesting to me.  That it made me more open <br/>\nminded and able to relate to all different types (even though I hold <br/>\npersonal beliefs very strongly). That my &quot;not having a style&quot; made it <br/>\neasier for others to approach me and feel comfotable and not box me <br/>\nin.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat conversation has stuck with me.  Looking back, she was right on <br/>\nthe money.  So, it may be confusing when either my public school/ <br/>\nLLL/attachment/homeschooling friends come over and find that I don&#39;t <br/>\nuse homeopathy (like they may think) but I try to buy dye-free <br/>\nbenadryl or that though I do have orgainic milk there are oreos and <br/>\nspongebob mac and cheese in the pantry (god forbid) &lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway,  I know you know what I mean.

I believe that we have so many parents trying to control every aspect of their children.  I&#39;ve always found that the children either rebel and go the extreme opposite or worse grow up unable to think for themselves.  I&#39;ve always valued my children&#39;s opinion and because of this my 13 year old daughter keeps me as her biggest confidant.  Her friends even have her or come themselves to me for advice.  Something I know I would never have done.  My children are very skeptical of anything that the majority is &quot;down for&quot;.  For example, my some was previously at a private school.  His teacher accused him of something he did not do.  Being raised to feel free to own his feelings and opinions, he asked the teacher to call me that he needed to speak to me.  He did not lie and play sick or argue and be disrespectful because he knows that&#39;s not acceptable.  He silently sat and refused to speak or work until I was called.  Unfortunately, I never was.  Can you imagine how strong he had to be in his convictions.  That was the last day at that school.  He was also paddled that day and still refused to discuss the situation or work until I was called.  The incident happened at 9:30 and I picked my 9 yo @ 3:30.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt a time when young people are we/out convictions and afraid to take a stand against the mainstream and especially feeling that their parents are their biggest advocate I am deeply moved.  I&#39;m sad that he went through that day but it was one of my proudest moments.  A moment only made possible because I raised them that their feelings are valued even if not agreed with and they are free to express them in appropriate and respectful ways.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Ticia <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, January 15, 2004 1:27 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] What do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  But that article is not in favor of people controlling it.

The mother of a boy Kirby&#39;s age was adamantly opposed to his having <br/>\n  any character-shirts or (HEAVEN FORBID) bedsheets or blankets.   She was going <br/>\n  to pay very much extra to get artsy-printed sheets from some expensive <br/>\n  buy-at-home thing because he had wanted Toy Story or whatever its equivalent was in <br/>\n  those days sheets, and she would NOT have him influenced by Disney even when he <br/>\n  was asleep.
