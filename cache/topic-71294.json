I completely empathize with<br/>\nyou there. If my sleep is disturbed I&#39;ll be quite irritable and feel foggy<br/>\nthroughout the day too. And no amount of coffee will bring me round :-).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to explain our story of sleep:We have always co-slept (bed shared -<br/>\nnot sure of international term). We have a superkingsize bed and a 9 and 6<br/>\nyear old. My husband has always gone to bed early and our eldest has joined<br/>\nhim followed by me around midnight or later and our youngest has fallen<br/>\nasleep somewhere between those times in her own room then joined us all<br/>\naround 3am. I suppose my children have developed there own bed etiquette<br/>\nand its harmonious with all four of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, there were times when it wasn&#39;t as peaceful and I was experiencing<br/>\nwhat you are.  On those foggy days of neck and headaches when I&#39;ll be<br/>\nreaching for the painkillers my eldest asked why I&#39;m taking them. And<br/>\nwithout finger pointing or cross words I was honest and explained that it<br/>\nwas due to lack of sleep/broken sleep (choosing my words carefully). We<br/>\ntalked lots about how we all feel or have felt getting up in the middle of<br/>\nthe night when ill or otherwise and how late we go, sleep cycles, how we<br/>\nfeel if its been a long busy day and over-tired, why sleep is important,<br/>\nwhy sleep patterns have changed over the centuries, when children do all<br/>\ntheir growing, how and when animals sleep etc Suffice to say it was a topic<br/>\nenjoyed by us all without it turning into a lecture or an issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that they reflected on this and took onboard the knock on effects<br/>\nof their own nocturnal habits. It took a while but they soon developed a<br/>\nharmonious pattern that works within our family meaning that we all get the<br/>\nquality of sleep we need as individuals.  There is still the odd bad dream<br/>\nor feeling unwell that will cause one or more of us to get up and need<br/>\ncuddles or to chat. Even now my youngest will still say she&#39;s just not<br/>\ntired at 9.30pm and we always say &#39;its ok to not feel tired when everyone<br/>\nelse is, don&#39;t try to sleep, just rest and read or quietly play&#39;. She&#39;s<br/>\nnoticeably content with that reminder and is often asleep within 30 minutes<br/>\nafter that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children get up in their own time in the mornings unless we have to be<br/>\nup early in which case they more often than not get up themselves...<br/>\nsomething about body clocks there I think ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my children it just seemed that honesty and facts helped them develop<br/>\nharmonious habits that work within our family considering all our own<br/>\npersonal requirements for a good quality sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the best, Melissa. I hope some of this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nVictoriaXX<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 21 Apr 2013 20:37, &quot;melgqd&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:boisei@...\">boisei@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt; I have two sons 11 and 7.

They took what was called a first sleep and a second sleep.  Presumably the first sleep started around dusk.  I imagine that after a few hours they would have to get up to restoke the fire, start the morning soup, relieve themselves, etc. then go back for the second sleep.  I find this fascinating and it&#39;s interesting that you never hear about it.

Mom, Dad & dog in the king sized bed with a kid on one side on a twin mattress and a kid at the foot of the bed with a bed made of old couch cushions held together by a twin fitted sheet (very comfy).  Typically I will go to to bed around 8pm and one or both of the kids will join me then (sometimes my son will hang out with Dad).  This is our time for tickling, playing zombie apocalypse, doing flips on the bed (not me, just the kids on that one!), etc.  Then Dad will come up around 9pm for more tickle/wind down time.  Then around 10 we transition to quieter, electronic activity (tv, lap top, I phone).  Dad will fall asleep shortly thereafter but as long as we whisper we can still talk without bothering him.  By 11pm I&#39;m totally done but the kids are not so I doze off while they watch or play quietly for about an hour more.  Usually they&#39;ll be asleep within the next hour and I don&#39;t hear them again.  Once in awhile I wake up at midnight and they&#39;re still up so I ask them if they&#39;ll turn stuff off when the current show ends and by then they&#39;re ready so they do.  We all sleep very well.  (Although I will admit there has been a lack of intimacy created by this arrangement that I&#39;d be happy to hear people&#39;s suggestions on if anyone is brave enough!)<br/>\n<br/>\n -=- The other side to this situation is that my sleep is also very interrupted, changing beds mid-way through, going back if people call out, and this is having a negative effect on my health (waking up with headaches, neck pain etc.).

I see they have them on Amazon for around $20.  Then you guys could spread out a little more and you could spend some nights with the kids all night.  On nights when Dad doesn&#39;t have to get up early you could move the mattresses into the other bedroom so you could sleep all night with your husband.  My kids just love their little beds and the feeling of having a slumber party every night.  Changing locations & having Dad there could be exciting!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- We go to bed, as in, we get in bed to hang out, from around ten-ish, and that really helps me to get some rest, even though we&#39;re not sleeping... He needs a long time to wind down for sleep. If I make sure I&#39;ve got enough energy for a half hour or so of chatting in the dark after I turn the light off, things definitely go more smoothly, as we both love those chatting times. Eventually I say I need to go to sleep now, and he is usually fine with that and will settle to go to sleep too (it&#39;s late by this time). But sometimes we&#39;ve been in the dark, quiet and still (ish!), and he will still be awake half an hour later.

Eventually I say I need to go to sleep now, and he is usually<br/>\n fine with that and will settle to go to sleep too (it&#39;s late by this time). But sometimes we&#39;ve been in the dark, quiet and still (ish!), and he will still be awake half an hour later. His mind can be very active, and he&#39;s thinking about stuff and wants to ask questions and chat more. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis struck me from your post: &quot;my sleep is also very interrupted, changing beds mid-way through, going back if people call out&quot;  Can you not stay in the bed with them and sleep there all night? Could you have a snuggle with your husband earlier in the evening before he goes to sleep and while the boys are still awake and occupied, then later you could retire with them for the whole night? I would think the broken nature of your nights is affecting your health more than the midnight bedtime?...<br/>\n<br/>\nJo<br/>\n<br/>\nPs. I&#39;ve included the whole original post below as it&#39;s not that long and it&#39;s a few days old so I thought it would be clearer what I was talking about!<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n From: melgqd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:boisei@...\">boisei@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Sunday, 21 April 2013, 20:05<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] help with sleep in older kids<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nHi all,<br/>\nI have two sons 11 and 7.  I usually go to sleep with them in their bed (full size) when they are ready to sleep.  My husband goes to sleep in our bed much earlier because he gets up early for work.  They both really enjoy me being there when they fall asleep (my older son especially gets gripped with fear at night and does much better with me near him).  I enjoy it too, however their bedtime has been slowly getting later and later.  I don&#39;t feel very good if I go to sleep much later than midnight.  I&#39;d prefer to sleep about 11 pm, but a bit later is fine.  However as they move to an even later time I don&#39;t feel well staying up so late.  I have never been a late night person.  We&#39;ve talked about meeting all our needs by going to bed a little earlier, but they are just not tired and we end up awake in bed for longer. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;m looking for suggestions about transitioning them to falling asleep without me or some other thing I haven&#39;t thought of where I can get more sleep and they can feel comfortable.  Any ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other side to this situation is that my sleep is also very interrupted, changing beds mid-way through, going back if people call out, and this is having a negative effect on my health (waking up with headaches, neck pain etc.).  It is different recently because everyone is getting bigger, and the bed is staying the same size (sadly we don&#39;t have room for a larger bed).   I&#39;m feeling that my quality of sleep is something I need to address.<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: help with sleep in older kids","postDate":"1366650749","msgId":71296,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtsM3IxdCs4Yml2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGtsMWQ5aStob25sQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71294,"nextInTopic":71302,"prevInTime":71295,"nextInTime":71297,"topicId":71294,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If you go to sleep in the boys bed before they do, can they fall asleep with you already there?
