It&#39;s about Iowa or Massachusetts or New  <br/>\nYork or France or California, or anyplace where reports or  <br/>\ninspections might conceivably be required.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I want to say that it&#39;s important to be in contact with people  <br/>\nfrom your own area.  Don&#39;t depend on a list like this, that&#39;s  <br/>\nintended to discuss how learning works in pure forms, to give you  <br/>\nlocal legal information.  It&#39;s not the purpose of this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as to local laws, those who have unschooled IN YOUR AREA are the  <br/>\nones to ask about how they&#39;ve worded letters of intent (if necessary)  <br/>\nand summary reports.  Ask them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut below is something I wrote this morning that I think might be  <br/>\nhelpful to someone.  Partly I know this from thinking about it for  <br/>\nyears.  Partly I know it because of having been a teacher, and  <br/>\nknowing that in a creative situation, sometimes the most important  <br/>\nlesson doesnt look like a lesson at all.  Partly I know this because  <br/>\nof reading and studying the methods called &quot;The Open Classroom,&quot; and  <br/>\nhaving been around through several waves of &quot;teach them the basics&quot;  <br/>\nand &quot;teach them to think.&quot;   Unschooling is a &quot;teach them to think&quot;  <br/>\nmethod.  People like to say &quot;It&#39;s not a method,&quot; but in a  <br/>\nsophisicated way, it most definitely is.<br/>\n<br/>\n=========================================================<br/>\nSo the first part is &quot;anonymous&quot; for this purpose.  Leave it that way.<br/>\nThe second part is me/Sandra.<br/>\n=========================================================<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-The radical unschooling in France isn&#39;t positive at all. It&#39;s  <br/>\nillegal. And<br/>\neven if some people would like to let their children free for the  <br/>\nlearning,<br/>\nI don&#39;t know any who don&#39;t limit a thing or another. I talk about this<br/>\nunschooling, not only the scholar things.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s illegal here too, in many states *IF* one were to describe it to  <br/>\nthe state as it&#39;s described on lists, the most ideally free life.   <br/>\nThe reason a family can do it is because the mom needs to understand  <br/>\nthe learning that is happening. Sometimes the mom records things that  <br/>\nwere learned but doesn&#39;t show those charts to the children.   <br/>\nSometimes the mom gets math games or videos or they play with money,  <br/>\nor she gets computer games about math if she&#39;s worried that the child  <br/>\nhasn&#39;t &quot;done any  math.&quot;    But there ARE ways to enrich a child&#39;s  <br/>\nlife and call it lessons on a report to the government without  <br/>\nletting the child know, and without pressuring him to finish, and  <br/>\nwithout testing him.   Each family needs to figure out how to make it  <br/>\nwork for that family in that jurisdiction, and sometimes the answer  <br/>\nis that it cannot be made to work in its ideal form.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26959,"nextTopicId":26996}}
