breaks for little Sandra when I read this. I read it for the first time a few days ago and have thought about it a lot since. Your innocence and sweetness juxtaposed to a jaded meanness makes my eyes well up with tears.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\">The most beneficial thing radical unschooling has taught is empathy. True empathy. There may have been a time when one of my kid&#39;s would have been doing something that irritated me tremendously and I would have lashed out for them to &quot;stop it! I&#39;ll get rid of all those ______ if you don&#39;t stop bugging me with them!&quot; I cringe to remember that old self. That very reactive and unthoughtful self. And guess who I learned it from? My mom. My own mother, whom I love dearly and tenderly today, was a most reactive and quick tempered woman while I was growing up. She asked me questions and never listened, she was more concerned with men than me, and as a child, I was always much happier at my dad&#39;s house. And then, the day after my 14th birthday, my oldest sister died and suddenly my mother realized that her children were mortal and she worked on changing herself. The change didn&#39;t happen overnight, and like most of us, she&#39;s still working on becoming a better person. Even though she made big changes to herself, it took a long time for me to forgive her and when I had my oldest child at the young age of 22, a lot of the hurt she had caused me flooded my memory and heart in full force. Once I held my son in my arms, I thought &quot;how could she ever have treated me like that? She never loved me!&quot; And then as my son got older and more babies came, I found myself unconsciously mimicking her behavior toward me. I was reactive and short tempered. I didn&#39;t want to &quot;play&quot; with my children. I wanted lots of kids, but I thought being a mother meant keeping them clean, polite, and conformed to what society wanted them to be, even though I have been a rebel my entire life! As my oldest son floundered, I realized something had to change. And that something was me. I found radical unschooling and as per that short-tempered, do-it-now self, wanted to jump in head first and be a radical unschooler!!</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\">But, I listened to the sage advice given on this forum and went slowly. One thing at a time, I told myself. I am SO GRATEFUL that my kids were all still quite young when I came to radical unschooling because they are getting the best of me and my husband! And I have truly forgiven my mother because if nothing else, unschooling has taught me empathy. Now, when my children are playing joyously, I feel inner joy and peace. When we&#39;re in the car and they want to play car games, I am so happy to play with them! I love that they consider me fun and attentive. I love that they give me big hugs and tell me how much they love me. And that when they&#39;re having a problem with something, or my oldest son is crying because he can&#39;t get his PS4 to work, I don&#39;t do what my mother would have done (get impatient and act incompetent as a helper), I EMPATHIZE with him and help. I tell myself &quot;imagine if you were him and something very important to you isn&#39;t working, how would you feel?&quot; And my husband does the same. We are all working together as a team and helping each other as though our own joy depended on it. And it does! Our children know that we are on their team--something I never got from my own mother. And that&#39;s okay now. I&#39;ve really forgiven her and she is now learning from me! She says to me all the time &quot;oh, I wish I would have had your wisdom and raised you all this way.&quot;&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\">Little does she know, it&#39;s not really my wisdom :). It&#39;s the wisdom I&#39;ve learned here.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\">And, now I can empathize with her. And the way she was raised. In fact, she pours her heart out to me over the traumas she experienced with her own mother. She can still be reactive and she&#39;s still not the best listener in the world, but my children love her and so do I. She stays with the kids sometimes and raves about them and they about her. They know the difference--with Hunny (what they call her), they watch whatever she wants to watch on TV because she can&#39;t stand cartoons, and they&#39;re okay with that. They complain a bit, but the whole sum of the experience with Hunny is greater that the parts.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\">My point in all this writing, is that radical unschooling can bring about such a sense of peace with one&#39;s own self, that it can be poured into the being of another. I *enjoy* finding ways to make other people around me comfortable, including my children. I *want* the people who come to my home to enjoy their experience here. Sometimes, we have to bend a little for others, and isn&#39;t that empathy? To feel another&#39;s feeling and adjust your own reaction to fit their need? Keeping peace has become the number one priority in our home, so sometimes we have to get creative to make that happen! Consideration for others is key.</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>I hope this helps with the situation with your mom. It&#39;s funny because I called my grandmother Nanny too.

True empathy. There may have been a time when one of my kid&#39;s would have been doing something that irritated me tremendously and I would have lashed out for them to &quot;stop it! I&#39;ll get rid of all those ______ if you don&#39;t stop bugging me with them!&quot; I cringe to remember that old self. That very reactive and unthoughtful self. And guess who I learned it from? My mom. My own mother, whom I love dearly and tenderly today, was a most reactive and quick tempered woman while I was growing up. She asked me questions and never listened, she was more concerned with men than me, and as a child, I was always much happier at my dad&#39;s house. And then, the day after my 14th birthday, my oldest sister died and suddenly my mother realized that her children were mortal and she worked on changing herself. The change didn&#39;t happen overnight, and like most of us, she&#39;s still working on becoming a better person. Even though she made big changes to herself, it took a long time for me to forgive her and when I had my oldest child at the young age of 22, a lot of the hurt she had caused me flooded my memory and heart in full force. Once I held my son in my arms, I thought &quot;how could she ever have treated me like that? She never loved me!&quot; And then as my son got older and more babies came, I found myself unconsciously mimicking her behavior toward me. I was reactive and short tempered. I didn&#39;t want to &quot;play&quot; with my children. I wanted lots of kids, but I thought being a mother meant keeping them clean, polite, and conformed to what society wanted them to be, even though I have been a rebel my entire life! As my oldest son floundered, I realized something had to change. And that something was me. I found radical unschooling and as per that short-tempered, do-it-now self, wanted to jump in head first and be a radical unschooler!!</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\">But, I listened to the sage advice given on this forum and went slowly. One thing at a time, I told myself. I am SO GRATEFUL that my kids were all still quite young when I came to radical unschooling because they are getting the best of me and my husband! And I have truly forgiven my mother because if nothing else, unschooling has taught me empathy. Now, when my children are playing joyously, I feel inner joy and peace. When we&#39;re in the car and they want to play car games, I am so happy to play with them! I love that they consider me fun and attentive. I love that they give me big hugs and tell me how much they love me. And that when they&#39;re having a problem with something, or my oldest son is crying because he can&#39;t get his PS4 to work, I don&#39;t do what my mother would have done (get impatient and act incompetent as a helper), I EMPATHIZE with him and help. I tell myself &quot;imagine if you were him and something very important to you isn&#39;t working, how would you feel?&quot; And my husband does the same. We are all working together as a team and helping each other as though our own joy depended on it. And it does! Our children know that we are on their team--something I never got from my own mother. And that&#39;s okay now. I&#39;ve really forgiven her and she is now learning from me! She says to me all the time &quot;oh, I wish I would have had your wisdom and raised you all this way.&quot; </span></div><div><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\">Little does she know, it&#39;s not really my wisdom :). It&#39;s the wisdom I&#39;ve learned here.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\">And, now I can empathize with her. And the way she was raised. In fact, she pours her heart out to me over the traumas she experienced with her own mother. She can still be reactive and she&#39;s still not the best listener in the world, but my children love her and so do I. She stays with the kids sometimes and raves about them and they about her. They know the difference--with Hunny (what they call her), they watch whatever she wants to watch on TV because she can&#39;t stand cartoons, and they&#39;re okay with that. They complain a bit, but the whole sum of the experience with Hunny is greater that the parts. </span></div><div><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\">My point in all this writing, is that radical unschooling can bring about such a sense of peace with one&#39;s own self, that it can be poured into the being of another. I *enjoy* finding ways to make other people around me comfortable, including my children. I *want* the people who come to my home to enjoy their experience here. Sometimes, we have to bend a little for others, and isn&#39;t that empathy? To feel another&#39;s feeling and adjust your own reaction to fit their need? Keeping peace has become the number one priority in our home, so sometimes we have to get creative to make that happen! Consideration for others is key.</span></div><div> </div><div>I hope this helps with the situation with your mom. It&#39;s funny because I called my grandmother Nanny too.

That’s really awful.  She should’ve looked at you before you left the house (and many other times, lovingly, and kindly), and found other shoes at home.  Or just put them away when you got there.  I was sad for thirteen-year-old you when I read that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom threw a yoyo out the car window once because I wouldn’t put the string on my middle finger.  I had it on my index finger.  She got so mad that I wouldn’t do it the way she said to, that she said give it to me, and just threw it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a long car ride, she threatened to throw my teddy bear out the window because I was holding him up to an open window so he could “see out.”  Twelve-hour drive, parents smoking, me easily car sick…   Just the thought that she would CONSIDER throwing him out still hurts me.   I still have that bear, but my mom is gone and I don’t mind that.   Still, I was kind to her and tried to help her to the end.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone battles for years, they have either battled and won (caused a loss to the opponent), or have battled and lost (so it was a waste of time and energy, and surely did them harm).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe world is big,  Avoidance is better than fighting. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy own integrity and my own goodness/virtue/whatever one wants to consider that was more important to me than “winning” something that couldn’t be won and wasn’t worth winning.  My mom was sober for nine years, until Kirby was nine or ten, and she started drinking again.  It was a nice break, for me, but by then I was learning that I shouldn’t try to “fix her” or save her, because I couldn’t anyway.  Detachment.  By the time she started up again, I was stronger and more solid, and had three children, and knew first hand that NOT drinking was better for me, my relationship with my husband, and for my children.

I am going to digress a bit and I hope it is not too much to write here. &nbsp;I promise I will get to the point. &nbsp;:-)</div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4515\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\"><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4515\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\">Growing up, I was surrounded by a conservative, Catholic, semi-cultish way of thinking. &nbsp;My grandparents, aunts, uncles and parents all agreed that we would probably experience the &quot;End of Times&quot; in our lifetime. &nbsp;The part of the apocolyptic story that fascinated me the most (the Bible was rarely encouraged, so I am not sure how much of this is based on Scripture. &nbsp;As I said, my family had fringe, somewhat cultish ideas that were outside mainstream Catholicism) was the claim that during the Rapture, mankind would get a terrifying glimpse into the darkness of their hearts. &nbsp;It would be a glimpse into the nature of our unacknowleged sin, and it would be a soul-shattering experience. &nbsp;I think that&#39;s when all the &quot;gnashing of teeth&quot; was supposed to happen. &nbsp;It troubled me, not so much out of fear, but philosophically, because I could not fathom how we could all be so ignorant of our sins. &nbsp;As a girl, I was very good at making a list of the things I needed to go over in Confession, and I puzzled over the idea that we were capable of leaving so much out. &nbsp;</div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4517\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\"><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4517\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\">I am no longer religious and find comfort in being able to set expectation of the &quot;End Times&quot; &nbsp;aside. &nbsp;But so as to not &quot;throw out the baby with the bathwater&quot;, I still like to think about some of the things I learned about as a Catholic, and to reframe them in my new way of thinking. &nbsp;At times, something that puzzled me when I was in the religion, makes more sense now that I am out of the religion, if that makes sense :-) &nbsp;</div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4519\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\"><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4519\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\">What I am getting at with all this talk of the rapturous insight is this: &nbsp;When I began reading Sandra&#39;s work, and subsequently all the other fantastic people I have discovered as a result, I suddenly understood what it was to be ignorant of my sins, and to suddenly have light shine upon them. &nbsp;I understood that I had been defending a lot of dark habits and actions, and as I began to examine those, it inevitably led me to a closer examination of my upbringing. &nbsp;I was shocked, almost to the point of much gnashing of teeth, to discover that much of what I believed was concerned and loving parenting, was in fact manipulative, selfish and myopic in scope. It became clear why I would become nearly ill before my visits with my mom and dad. &nbsp; Down came the pedastal. &nbsp;I experienced how soul-shattering it can be to look inside. &nbsp;</div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4521\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\"><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4521\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\">In acknowleging the problems with my parents, I naturally circled back to the problems I had with my spouse and children. I had to admit that I had often chosen the same relationship strategies my parents had chosen, which was mainly to control the situation at all costs. &nbsp;I knew I could not stand over them in judgment. &nbsp;That has been hard, because I had not allowed myself to get very angry with them as a youth. &nbsp;I had defended and admired them, even when they were cruel, usually chalking their actions up to what any good parent would do. &nbsp;I elevated them to a lofty and unrealistic status. &nbsp;</div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4523\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\">So when I did admit that they had made mistakes, it came in an angry flood. &nbsp;I believe I sat in a stupor an entire afternoon, experiencing wave after wave of disgust as each memory came to the surface. &nbsp;Then followed a period where I turned upon myself and recalled times that I had played out similar dynamics with my children.</div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4525\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\"><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4525\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\">Now the dust has settled, and awareness has taken firmer root, and while I still get sad, hope is close at hand. Unfortunately, the relationship with my parents has worsened, which I know doesn&#39;t sound hopeful. &nbsp;But it has not worsened because of my realizatons. &nbsp;There has not been a confrontation or discussion involving what I have learned. &nbsp;What is happening to my parents, I believe would have happened regardless of what changes I have gone through. &nbsp;They have chosen the path of alcoholism and it seems to get deeper each year. &nbsp;So while that part of the story is not so uplifting, what HAS improved is my ability to deal with the situation in a healthy way. &nbsp;Without a doubt, I owe a big chunk of my positive movement forward to the loving and rational discussion that occurs on this list.</div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4527\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\"><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4527\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\">This post about &quot;being a champion for my daughter&quot; and the discussion it sparked is a great example of how I have been helped here. &nbsp;Upon reading the original poster&#39;s account of the grandmother manipulating her granddaughter&#39;s attire, I could immediately feel an emotional response rising inside of me. &nbsp;My knee-jerk reactions were bubbling pretty fiercly by the time I concluded my reading. &nbsp;I was sympathizing heavily with the young girl in the story. &nbsp;</div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4527\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\"><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4527\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\">I once had a pair of Converse All-Stars on which I had inscribed all of my favorite band logos. &nbsp;At thirteen, they were a prized possession. &nbsp;I wore them everywhere, so I had them on when we left for a holiday visit with extended family. &nbsp;About halfway through the carride, my mother noticed what shoes I was wearing and flew into a rage. &nbsp;She had my father pull the car over, came to the backseat where I was, and intimidated me into handing my shoes over to her. &nbsp;She instructed my father to continue driving and when he reached full speed, she tossed my shoes out the window, one at a time. &nbsp;When we reached our destination, she made a big deal about telling all of my relatives that we had to go to a department store to get me some proper shoes (which ended up being some awkward dress shoes). &nbsp;The way everyone coped with the shame of the incident was to make a big joke about it. &nbsp;My parents still tell the story and laugh about how rebellious I was. In a few years, I had fully internalized and accepted their claims that I was wickedly rebellious, and I began adulthood as a confused and frightened young woman. &nbsp;</div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4529\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\"><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4529\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\">I felt a pang of grief while I pictured the young girl with her harmless hood and the grandmother who didn&#39;t want to be seen with her. &nbsp;Then, I read the first and inflammatory (albiet, with good intentions) response in the List. &nbsp;My blood started boiling and I wanted to shout an &quot;Amen&quot; as the writer challenged the original poster to confront the challenge with her mother head on. &nbsp;All of my hurt was merging with the hurt of the one I was reading about, and there was only the narrow feeling of wanting it to end NOW and at all costs.</div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4507\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\"><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4507\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\">But then came the posts that are the reason I keep coming back here; the ones that point toward alternate paths, &nbsp;gradual change, and understanding. &nbsp;I come here not to get myself into flames of emotion or to attack issues. &nbsp;Letting my emotions addictingly take over has gotten me into enough messes. &nbsp;</div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4532\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\"><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4532\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\">I am here because of the sensible examples of folks thinking things through and urging a course that is thoughtful and peaceful. &nbsp;</div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4534\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\"><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4534\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\">I am going to see my parents in two days and I am feeling better about it than I have, probably, ever. &nbsp;Unfortunately, they are more steeped in alcohol than ever, but I am not angry about it and I know better than to take it personally. &nbsp;It is painful, but I have tools to deal with the pain constructively. &nbsp;I didn&#39;t want to let this day pass without thanking you (when I say &quot;you&quot; I mean everyone who posts so thoughtfully here) for your contribution to my healing.</div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4536\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\"><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4536\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\" dir=\"ltr\">It is true that I regressed for a minute, getting caught up in the drama and pain of the wrongs of my childhood. &nbsp;You were there to remind me that I love my parents, that they didn&#39;t always have it easy growing up, and ultimately I want things to get better. &nbsp;For that to happen, &nbsp;I need to make conscious and loving choices. &nbsp;I need to let it happen one moment at a time, and not get in such a damn fury over it. &nbsp;</div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4538\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\"><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4538\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\">Many thanks! &nbsp;</div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4538\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\"><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4540\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\">Jennifer</div><div dir=\"ltr\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4542\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\"><br id=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4544\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-223454998\"></div></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":495438666,"authorName":"Sarah Thompson","from":"Sarah Thompson &lt;thompsonisland@...&gt;","profile":"wallacesmum","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Becoming My Child&#39;s Champion (Long Testimonial)","postDate":"1450296828","msgId":76476,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBUHYrY1l4dnZaRVQ4eGdVVXlQRU0xNXRnakNCcHFZN0ZhPTRwRHJrLVFvM21hPXROd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG40c2didSsxOTg2ZGs2QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBK2JBdFFDZnM5QzNpNHVhbUFuNlFhbXl5cWFKRUNTUXpaY2UxcUJKVTlyV0FnV3FzUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JPG40c2didSsxOTg2ZGs2QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":76475,"nextInTopic":76477,"prevInTime":76475,"nextInTime":76477,"topicId":76446,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This seems pertinent- - That didn t happen because I bullied him into being who I wanted him to be.

My mother-in-law was kind of snarky about me, but I decided early on to never be mean about it, and I wasn’t.  She lived into her 90’s, and eventually, because I had been nice to her and had prepared my children for visits to her, instead of trying to change her to suit me, after a dozen years or so she totally appreciated what unschooling was doing for our family, and said so, in writing—that we were good parents and our kids were great.<br/>\n<br/>\nCycles can be broken without screaming fights and door slamming.  <br/>\nEither life is long and you have some time, or life is short, and it’s not important.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of thinking up even more irritating things for the granddaughter to wear, you could (easily, and kindly) find something that will satisfy the grandmother and the child.  Without doing that, the problem is there, in the mother who wants to spite her own mother.  That’s not partnering with your child.<br/>\n<br/>\nA child who is not under attack doesn’t need a champion.

Not every child has that in their lives.  Try not to be too fragile.  Don&#39;t break so easily.  Your daughter will learn more from seeing how you competently handle the tricky parts in relationships, than she will from seeing you heartbroken.  Almost all relationships have tricky parts.

And if it’s done without panic or urgency, it can include the grandparents.<br/>\n<br/>\nBurning bridges behind oneself has always been considered a bad move.<br/>\nBurning all bridges because they’re “the outside world” is a supremely bad idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Becoming My Child&#39;s Champion (Long Testimonial)","postDate":"1450226553","msgId":76460,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA4M0FDMzNFLTUwRTUtNEU1MS1CNDVDLTU4OUMyNEJDMzdCNUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENPTDEzMC1XMjQxQUREMUUxMDhFQzg5RkI0RjY5N0M0RUUwQHBoeC5nYmw+","referencesHeader":"PG40aW5xbyt2bzg0OWlAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPiA8Q09MMTMwLVcxOTM5M0UyMTZGQTNCQkM0Q0MzNjVBQzRFRTBAcGh4LmdibD4gPENPTDEzMC1XMjQxQUREMUUxMDhFQzg5RkI0RjY5N0M0RUUwQHBoeC5nYmw+"},"prevInTopic":76459,"nextInTopic":76461,"prevInTime":76459,"nextInTime":76461,"topicId":76446,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-It would probably be helpful for you to have an unschooling friendly therapist of some kind to help you work through your difficulties with your mother.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1234334965\">-=-It would probably be helpful for you to have an unschooling friendly therapist of some kind to help you work through your difficulties with your mother.

dir=\"ltr\">My grandmother was like this. She was bossy and image-conscious and had been a kindergarten teacher. When my sister and I were little, we adored her. She had lots of fiddly things-miniatures, Victorian knick-knacks, jewelry boxes. She would take us shopping and set up art projects. It was all well and good until we started to bridle against the condescension, the patronization, the manipulation. &quot;Do you hate me?&quot; when I refused to make the bed, a kid&#39;s table with macaroni when the adults had lobster, &quot;When do the girls start wearing padded bras?&quot; to my mother, in front of me, during my early teens; this stuff adds up. By the time I was 14, neither of us wanted anything to do with her, and we were practically estranged by the time she died. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I didn&#39;t like the way she treated my mother, and it is a life&#39;s work to undo the damage she did with the precedent she set for my relationship with my own mother and *her* relationship with *my* kids. I see in my mother a lifetime of living as less than her whole, true self, because of her loss of her father very youn and her domineering mother. The troubled and murky space in my life where an easy relationship with my mother should be is a constant gravitational force in my work towards mental and physical health. I love my mother, as I loved my grandmother, but there are times when I would gladly trade that love for just liking her more instead.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Don&#39;t let your children&#39;s current adoration (which is a complex emotion and different from easy affection and comfort, reverential and not necessarily reciprocated in kind) be an excuse for abuse, how ever &quot;gentle&quot; and &quot;mild&quot; it is. My sister had some serious body image issues as a teen-my grandmother, not my mother, was the only one to ever comment on her weight or her body, and we didn&#39;t even live with her or see her all the time. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This might sound a little harsh. As Gandalf says, &quot;I&#39;m not trying to rob you, I&#39;m trying to help you.&quot; I wish so much that my mother had had the tools of unschooling to repair and redeem and redefine her relationship with her mother and herself. She tried, using the tools she hadn but they weren&#39;t powerful enough. *Someone* has to break the cycle. Let it be you.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sarah</p></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":342782030,"authorName":"K Pennell","from":"K Pennell &lt;mrsringsabre@...&gt;","profile":"mrsringsabre","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Becoming My Child&#39;s Champion (Long Testimonial)","postDate":"1450196263","msgId":76450,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMzA1NzEyMDAuMTU5OTc4NC4xNDUwMTk2MjY0MDI0LkphdmFNYWlsLnlhaG9vQG1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PG40aW5xbyt2bzg0OWlAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PG40aW5xbyt2bzg0OWlAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":76449,"nextInTopic":76451,"prevInTime":76449,"nextInTime":76451,"topicId":76446,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-  Well, she said, I guess Nanny will just wait in the car when you go anywhere, since I don t want to be seen with you wearing that on your head.-=- This","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-575728566\"><html><head></head><div style=\"color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;\"><div dir=\"ltr\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-575728566yui_3_16_0_1_1450192391449_12881\">-=-&nbsp;<span class=\"ygrps-yiv-575728566\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-575728566yui_3_16_0_1_1450192391449_10475\" style=\"color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;\">&quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;I guess Nanny will just wait in the car when you go anywhere, since I don&#39;t want to be seen with you wearing that on your head.-=-</span></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-575728566yui_3_16_0_1_1450192391449_13039\" dir=\"ltr\"><br><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-575728566\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-575728566yui_3_16_0_1_1450192391449_10475\" style=\"color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;\"></span></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-575728566yui_3_16_0_1_1450192391449_13040\" dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-575728566\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-575728566yui_3_16_0_1_1450192391449_10475\" style=\"color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;\">This is a manipulative statement.

I still have plenty of hang ups but one that has never phased me is clothes.  I have a 5yo daughter and I&#39;ve always told her, &quot;As long as your clothes are clean and modest, I&#39;m not worried about what you wear.&quot;  And this has been a great sense of freedom for her.  Pink polka dot pants with a neon orange striped shirt?  Sure!  Pajama bottoms and a MLP t-shirt?  Great!  Snow White Halloween costume?  Don&#39;t forget the tiara!  My son is the same way.  If their clothes are dirty, I encourage them to change (if we are going out -- at home I&#39;m not so worried.  Long as they&#39;ve changed every 24 hours or so, I&#39;m good.) and I have asked my daughter to put something over the odd tank top t-shirt, but on the whole, it&#39;s worked out remarkably well.</span></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa\" style=\"direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><span><br></span></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa\" style=\"direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><span>This week, my mother came over to visit with us and to watch my 2yo while my daughter and I were in seeing the optometrist.  My daughter had out on a pair of purple leggings pants and a purple and grey t-shirt with a sewn on vest, backwards.  I was going to ask her to turn it around but I got sidetracked and forgot about it.  If it had been facing the right way, it would have been cute.  But that&#39;s what she had picked out and that was fine with me.</span></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa\" style=\"direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><span><br></span></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa\" style=\"direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><span>My mother arrived and she started helping me with my housework before we went to our appointments.  To my mother, this involved bathing my 2yo (he&#39;d had a bath the night before, I don&#39;t know why she felt the need to give him another one) and then helping my 5yo clean her room.  All the while I am running around trying to get my housework done before we leave.</span></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa\" style=\"direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><span><br></span></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa\" style=\"direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><span>Suddenly my daughter comes down with the most sullen, angry face.  She&#39;s wearing different clothes -- a grey shirt with butterflies and a pair of burgundy pants that match the butterflies.  She also has a good from a puffy vest on her head (unattached to said puffy vest) and she is just miserable.  I ask her what&#39;s wrong and she states that she doesn&#39;t like her outfit.  I ask her why not and she said Nanny made her change it.  I asked why, since the other outfit was clean and perfectly fine, except the shirt was backwards.  She just shrugged.  So I asked my mother and she said that because her shirt was weird she made her change.  </span></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa\" style=\"direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><span><br></span></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa\" style=\"direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><span>I was bothered by this -- how my mother just assumed that what she was wearing wasn&#39;t good enough and made her change.  So right there, in front of my mother, I told my daughter she could go change into whatever she wanted, or could put something else on to make the outfit hers.  But my poor sweet little girl was just so defeated at the idea of being forced to wear something she didn&#39;t want to that she just muttered, &quot;No, it&#39;s fine&quot; and moved on.</span></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa\" style=\"direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><span><br></span></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa\" style=\"direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><span>Later on, my mother told her to take off the hood she still was wearing on her head, which she refused.  My mother started telling her she wasn&#39;t allowed to go anywhere with it on.  Of course, it did indeed look silly to be wearing a hood without a jacket or vest attached, but that&#39;s not how our family deals with things like that.  And so I stepped in, trying to help them both come to a satisfying compromise.  And then, my mother said something that just bore right through my heart.</span></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa\" style=\"direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><span><br></span></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa\" style=\"direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><span>&quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;I guess Nanny will just wait in the car when you go anywhere, since I don&#39;t want to be seen with you wearing that on your head.</span></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa\" style=\"direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><span><br></span></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa\" style=\"direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><span>And at that moment, I realized that my daughter had no voice against my mother.  Nothing she said or did with regards to the hood would be accepted.  She had no worth or respect with regards to this hood.  Don&#39;t get me wrong -- my mother absolutely adores my children, and there&#39;s nothing my children love more than to visit with Nanny.  But this comment just broke me.  And I realized that if she had no voice, she couldn&#39;t stand up for herself.  She needed me to be her champion, to stand up for her and to say what she wanted to say without being in a place where she would be punished for speaking to an adult in what would be preceived as rude.  </span></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa\" style=\"direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><span><br></span></div><p><span></span></p><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa\" style=\"direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><span>So I was able to help them come to an agreement.  My daughter agreed to wear the hood in the car, and to and from the stores we visited, but once inside the buildings, she would take it off.  I could see my mother was not very happy with this agreement, but frankly, at that point, I couldn&#39;t care less.  My daughter&#39;s heart and happiness was more valuable to me than my mother getting her way.  </span></div><p><span><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-176534116yui-cursor\"></span></p></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76447,"nextTopicId":76487}}
