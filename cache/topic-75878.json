Sometimes both.  Does it mean teens need security?  Probably.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes it mean teens need arbitrary rules?  Probably not, though many families see that as the way the parents exercise and display their &quot;power&quot; and authority.  The power to thwart.  The power to forbid.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for unschoolers, what DO parents have the power and authority to provide or to prevent?  That&#39;s where to look, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrinciples.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/phrases\">http://sandradodd.com/phrases</a><br/>\nThis is only off topic insofar as &quot;teens need boundaries&quot; isn&#39;t in there.
