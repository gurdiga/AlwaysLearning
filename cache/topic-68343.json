He&#39;s noticed a problem that is frustrating him: not moving forward on his projects as much as he&#39;d like<br/>\nto. He&#39;s analyzed that and come up with a reason he thinks why that&#39;s happening: he&#39;s drawn into watching stuff and finds it hard to stop in favour of<br/>\nhis projects. And from there he&#39;s proposed a solution: a rule about not watching during certain times. Cool!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s pretty typical for people, adult or child, to reach for a rule as their first response, especially when they&#39;ve come from a rules-based<br/>\nenvironment. Your son likely (and very logically) added those earlier experiences to the mix when trying to figure out a solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you speak with him, you could talk about how the rule is one possible solution to try to help him spend more time with his projects (don&#39;t<br/>\npresent it as a sure-fire solution, it may well not do the trick, and he&#39;ll find there are really other reasons behind the frustration, this is his<br/>\nfirst guess).  Explain that there&#39;s a downside though, that his brother might not want the screen-off time, and he&#39;d need to agree as well since it<br/>\nwould affect them both. Suggest that you guys brainstorm all sorts of ways to try to help him spend more time with his projects, keeping the rule as<br/>\nthe first idea - if you throw it out right off the bat, you&#39;ll may well give him the impression you&#39;re not really working *together*, that really, you<br/>\nhave the final say.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom there you guys can probably come up with all sorts of ideas:<br/>\n- as was already suggested, another (screen-less) room all nicely set up for his projects so he can get started right away (maybe it&#39;s really the prep<br/>\nthat has been a barrier to his getting started)<br/>\n- maybe he can work on his projects first thing when he wakes up, before he starts watching<br/>\n- or maybe use a natural transition, like after breakfast, or lunch (and you can help by making a nice meal and inviting him to eat away from the<br/>\nscreen - make it a fun transition time somehow)<br/>\n- would he like to open up project time to his brother as well?<br/>\n- you could offer to do the projects with him, that might be more enticing than feeling like he&#39;s going off on his to do stuff<br/>\n<br/>\n... just a few ideas to help you get started.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if you do end up trying out the rule, let him know that you&#39;re happy to remind him about it, but you won&#39;t become an &quot;enforcer&quot;. Try it and see<br/>\nwhat happens. If you say &quot;Okay, it&#39;s 3pm, time to turn off the tv. You guys wanted to work on your projects at 3pm for an hour.&quot; And they kick up a<br/>\nfuss, &quot;No!!
