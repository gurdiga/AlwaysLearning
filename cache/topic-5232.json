They are coming up with a system that <br/>\nlooks at ALL of the different residue on one fruit or veggie instead of each <br/>\nsubstance separately.<br/>\nIt&#39;ll probably take years for them to figure it out though...duh.<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5228,"nextTopicId":5233}}
