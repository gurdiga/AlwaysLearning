I think a lot of parents expect children to share with  <br/>\nother children that they barely know and I think children are  <br/>\nprotective over their things and do not know the other child well  <br/>\nenough to know if they are going treat their toy nicely. I know with  <br/>\nmy girls when I come across the sharing situation I ask them if they  <br/>\nhave a toy that they wouldn&#39;t mind playing with and if they do can  <br/>\nthey go and get it for them. I know with myself I am weary when  <br/>\nsomeone new comes into my house and touches things that I are valuable  <br/>\nto me because I really do not know the person. I try to prepare my  <br/>\nchildren when someone new is coming over and ask them if they want to  <br/>\nput up the things that they do not want others to play with.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I agree if it is done with tears it is not sharing. If the  <br/>\nchildren are young then maybe have a variety of toys out and put up  <br/>\nthe one that you know your child values over the other toys.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrenda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nProud momma of 3 amazing girls.

If someone asked if they could take my guitar home, they&#39;d<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; better be my REALLY good friend.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I noticed my children readily shared most of the time with friends, and<br/>\nalmost always with me, whether I asked them to share with me or not!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, my question now is how does a child learn about sharing?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Little by little in lots of different ways. By you sharing with her.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; By being generous with what you have. By helping her feel she has<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;enough&quot;. The reason to hold onto something is because you fear you<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; won&#39;t get more. It&#39;s far easier to share when you feel you have more<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; than enough. It&#39;s a rare child who won&#39;t share something that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; essentially endless like water or paper ;-) It&#39;s only when there&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; feel of rationing that people feel they need to hold onto what they<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; have<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have always shared with my kids, and so they reciprocate.  But even if<br/>\nthey have enough children need not share with everyone all the time.   <br/>\nIt is<br/>\nmuch easier to share with people whom you have a relationship with, so I<br/>\nthink most children might be willing to give their friend a turn or a  <br/>\npiece<br/>\nmore often than a stranger :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMany parents ask their children to sacrifice toys, or treats to  <br/>\nstrangers.<br/>\nWhile that makes them &quot;the popular parent&quot; with the neighbours, I would<br/>\nguess the child might feel resentful and angry at being bullied into  <br/>\nmaking<br/>\nsacrifices.  Sharing is one instance where adults demand much more of<br/>\nchildren than of themselves!  It really demonstrates how disempowered<br/>\nchildren are in our world!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, note that if your child surrenders something to someone while in  <br/>\ntears<br/>\nor has a meltdown that is not sharing.  If someone asks me at gunpoint  <br/>\nto<br/>\nshare my wallet, I will hand it over, but I would not call it  <br/>\nsharing.  I<br/>\nwould call it theft!  I would never want to invite the thief to  <br/>\ndinner, nor<br/>\nwould I be willing to shake hands and wish him well.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46355,"nextTopicId":46343}}
