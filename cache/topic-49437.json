So if he&#39;s restless, and full of energy... I should find him something active to do? I don&#39;t really mind him being full of energy, but it usually leads to him singing.. which is great, but he makes up innapropriate songs.***<br/>\n <br/>\nMaybe he likes the shock value of innappropriate songs!  People have made livings off of shock value.  I wouldn&#39;t dismiss it entirely, shock value requires being clever.  That doesn&#39;t mean that he needs to sing about farts at the dinner table.  Think time and place.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I do make sure that he is eating and drinking throughout the day. However, I don&#39;t want him eating and drinking while sitting on the couch.***<br/>\n <br/>\nWhy?  You don&#39;t have to answer on list, but it will help you maybe to think about the rules you have in your house.  Is there a place that he can eat and drink and play video games?<br/>\n<br/>\n***Now, I&#39;m not as strict as my husband, but I would like &quot;something&quot; to be accomplished during the day. If my son&#39;s room is messy, he&#39;s left clothes all over his bathroom (along with garbage, etc.), he has left his things laying around all over the house and wants to play video games rather than pick anything up, then I am not happy about that choice.***<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s not a real choice then.  My 15 yr old daughter has always been messy.  I&#39;ve picked up after her for years.  I&#39;ve cleaned her room and her bathroom because she appreciates it and I like it cleaner than she keeps it.  Just this last month she&#39;s decided that she wants to keep her room and bathroom clean, and just like that she&#39;s doing it, no prompting from me.  It&#39;s very internal, for personal reasons.  She has friends who&#39;s parents MAKE them do these things and it&#39;s a constant struggle of power.  These kids will not do any of it without being told to do it first.  That&#39;s what forced chores do to a person, it ensures that mom and dad must ask and make sure that their child does it, and it ensures that it won&#39;t happen unless mom and dad make sure it happens.<br/>\n <br/>\nIs that your intended goal, to be the keeper of your son&#39;s cleanliness until he moves out?  If it&#39;s not, then it really will help to examine that aspect of your life.  It will help too, to see his messes as life happening.  Living is messy.  Clothing is easy to pick up, just do it if you want it done.  It will go a long way towards happiness and helping to create a happy nest for your children to explore in.  Here&#39;s something else on chores... <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/influencing%20kid%20behavior/chores/kidstohelpwithchores.html%c2%a0and\">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/influencing%20kid%20behavior/chores/kidstohelpwithchores.html%c2%a0and</a> more here... <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/chores/\">http://sandradodd.com/chores/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n***It is true that ADHD is usually diagnosed in schools.

We will call her name 10 times before she will respond and she has a hard time sitting in her seat at school and focusing. (I witnessed it when I helped out at a school party)***<br/>\n <br/>\nHow wonderful that your child has the ability to tune out nonsense and focus on something more important to her.  You should read the book Clementine, it&#39;s a cute kid&#39;s book, probably perfect for a 6 yr old, it&#39;s a short chapter book, all about a girl who really pays attention, but is always accused of not.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I&#39;m open to learning more about this, but I&#39;m sure most of you can understand what a new concept it can be to people.***<br/>\n <br/>\nHere&#39;s another link to check out...  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/beginning\">http://sandradodd.com/beginning</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I have some random questions about all this.

That happened to both myself and my husband. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo for those of you who are religious, does that fit into your unschooling?***<br/>\n <br/>\nYou will be way more effective if you don&#39;t force, but do it because it&#39;s something you love and believe and want to share.  Just like offering a plate of delicious food, some will be eaten and some will not.  That is how people are.<br/>\n<br/>\n***My son has strong interests which are: Video Games, Legos, internet, playing with action figures.

One answer is to<br/>\n&gt; invest mental and emotional energy in learning what your child loves about<br/>\n&gt; the games, and finding ways to become more comfortable with longer game<br/>\n&gt; play.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What do you mean by &quot;wild&quot;? Is it just a desire to get out some restless<br/>\n&gt; energy? Is it actually a response to being dragged away from his passion<br/>\n&gt; before he is ready? Have you made sure he has enough snacks and drinks<br/>\n&gt; while<br/>\n&gt; he plays?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is it the games that cause it, or is it the fact of having been sitting<br/>\n&gt; still for a while? My 10 yo dd certainly gets physically antsy at times<br/>\n&gt; when<br/>\n&gt; she has been hunkering down at home for a day or two, whether that be to<br/>\n&gt; play a lot of computer games, do a lot of drawing or any other largely<br/>\n&gt; sedentary activity. Usually she will want to go to the park for while, or<br/>\n&gt; do<br/>\n&gt; more physical stuff at home, including yoga and sofa balancing, and some<br/>\n&gt; kicking and wrestling. Sometimes she is rowdy before sleep.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How can you describe his energy in positive, empowering terms rather than<br/>\n&gt; as<br/>\n&gt; a problem to eliminated?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How can you support and facilitate his need for some exercise towards the<br/>\n&gt; end of his day?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We used to grab our flashlights and go for night walks in our neighborhood.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s how we saw the little owl that time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Instead of trying to get him to be still, perhaps try asking him about his<br/>\n&gt; gaming experience while he jumps or climbs.

(which can happen with e-mails anyway)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure some of this will sound like I&#39;m rambling, which is just how I am. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son has been out of school for about a month. I&#39;m still researching different homeschool techniques.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure &quot;wild&quot; was the wrong word to use.  So if he&#39;s restless, and full of energy... I should find him something active to do? I don&#39;t really mind him being full of energy, but it usually leads to him singing.. which is great, but he makes up innapropriate songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf his sisters are around he will call them pests, etc. and if he gets upset with them he&#39;ll threaten them to the extent of wanting to smack them beat them. I&#39;m not saying all that is &quot;because&quot; of him playing video games or some computer games, but it happens A Lot more after he&#39;s played for hours. So rather than saying he becomes &quot;wild&quot; he becomes restless, which usually leads to him being obnoxious and aggressive.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n I do make sure that he is eating and drinking throughout the day. However, I don&#39;t want him eating and drinking while sitting on the couch.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband has very little patience. To be honest, he has more of a problem with him &quot;playing video games all day&quot;  than I do.  You&#39;re right, &quot;all day&quot; = &quot;more than I am comfortable with&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI was actually quite surprised that my husband let me pull our son out of school. He was brought up a certain way and was in the Navy for 10 years, so he expects us to do something constructive with 99% of our time.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I&#39;m not as strict as my husband, but I would like &quot;something&quot; to be accomplished during the day. If my son&#39;s room is messy, he&#39;s left clothes all over his bathroom (along with garbage, etc.), he has left his things laying around all over the house and wants to play video games rather than pick anything up, then I am not happy about that choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is true that ADHD is usually diagnosed in schools. (he also struggles with depression/anxiety and might be bi-polar or have Aspergers)  I&#39;m not so concerned with his inability to focus, more with his excessive energy. At home it&#39;s not always a big deal, but I would like him to act &quot;appropriately&quot; when we are at other people&#39;s houses or at a restaurant, etc. I want all of my kids to be respectful of others.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n My daughter just turned six and I think she is ADHD, although she hasn&#39;t been diagnosed yet. We will call her name 10 times before she will respond and she has a hard time sitting in her seat at school and focusing. (I witnessed it when I helped out at a school party)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI want to home-school all my kids eventually. For now, my girls LOVE school, so I will probably let them finish out the year. My son needed out desperately. School was killing his self esteem and he was feeling &quot;stupid&quot; and &quot;useless&quot;.  I am working to heal all that.  I know that he is creative and very smart.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m open to learning more about this, but I&#39;m sure most of you can understand what a new concept it can be to people. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I have some random questions about all this. (to everyone)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are a religious family and want to instill values and morals in our children. We certainly don&#39;t want to shove it down their throats though and have them rebel. That happened to both myself and my husband. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo for those of you who are religious, does that fit into your unschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you limit anything? Do you just let your kids do what they want all day?  What about chores/bathing/getting dressed/meal time?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son has strong interests which are: Video Games, Legos, internet, playing with action figures.  He does like the Wii Fit. He was doing that yesterday which I thought was great. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI appreciate you trying to help me understand all this and I appreciate your &quot;tone&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nJill<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dezigna@...\">dezigna@...</a><br/>\nDate: Wed, 6 Jan 2010 19:22:27 -0800<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Computer game advice?<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt; I&#39;m new to all this.. so I apologize if I rubbed anyone the wrong way...<br/>\nI just struggle to let my ADHD child play games all day that make him wild <br/>\nand want to run around the house....&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one is rubbed the wrong way by honest questions from folks new to <br/>\nunschooling or this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow long has your child been out of school?

My daughter Roxie is 7 in a few months and adores it. I actually love playing it with her too, and she recently convinced her dad to get a character as well.  We play it together on 2 separate computers, which is really fun and I read out any instructions and missions she wants to do. You can do lots on it for free. We played it free for months and only recently got a membership ($7.95 usd per month for 3 months) which opens up more of the &#39;world&#39; and things you can do. I also think the graphics are great and it&#39;s really easy to learn and get around, there&#39;s some quite challenging games in it too. Can you tell we love it!<br/>\n<br/>\n We also tried &#39;Club Penguin&#39; which is a similar format, but didn&#39;t get into it as much. I&#39;ve also had a brief look at &#39;Fantage&#39;, &#39;Super Secret&#39;, &#39;Franktown Rocks&#39; and &#39;Runescape&#39; they all look pretty cool and you can play for free till you want to go on more missions etc... Runescape is too scary for my daughter, but the others look cute. We haven&#39;t played them so I can&#39;t say a lot about them or recommend, but I thought i&#39;d mention just in case you wanna check &#39;em out (you can google them).<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, Hope (in Melbourne, Australia)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":345152630,"authorName":"Julie V","from":"&quot;Julie V&quot; &lt;thewekkenfam@...&gt;","profile":"vegfam3","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Computer game advice?","postDate":"1262841894","msgId":49462,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhpM3I3NithOHYzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDMyNTg3Ni4xOTM0Ny5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MTAubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49460,"nextInTopic":49466,"prevInTime":49461,"nextInTime":49463,"topicId":49437,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I agree with this post, as I have been there.

One answer is to <br/>\ninvest mental and emotional energy in learning what your child loves about <br/>\nthe games, and finding ways to become more comfortable with longer game <br/>\nplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you mean by &quot;wild&quot;? Is it just a desire to get out some restless <br/>\nenergy? Is it actually a response to being dragged away from his passion <br/>\nbefore he is ready? Have you made sure he has enough snacks and drinks while <br/>\nhe plays?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it the games that cause it, or is it the fact of having been sitting <br/>\nstill for a while? My 10 yo dd certainly gets physically antsy at times when <br/>\nshe has been hunkering down at home for a day or two, whether that be to <br/>\nplay a lot of computer games, do a lot of drawing or any other largely <br/>\nsedentary activity. Usually she will want to go to the park for while, or do <br/>\nmore physical stuff at home, including yoga and sofa balancing, and some <br/>\nkicking and wrestling. Sometimes she is rowdy before sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can you describe his energy in positive, empowering terms rather than as <br/>\na problem to eliminated?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can you support and facilitate his need for some exercise towards the <br/>\nend of his day?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe used to grab our flashlights and go for night walks in our neighborhood. <br/>\nThat&#39;s how we saw the little owl that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of trying to get him to be still, perhaps try asking him about his <br/>\ngaming experience while he jumps or climbs. A small trampoline? A jump rope? <br/>\nYou will know whether these activities are possible. (One of the reasons we <br/>\ntend to go for a walk is that we live on the second floor.)<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst coming to unschooling can turn your whole mind inside out - it can <br/>\nseem like nothing you say is right, that people are asking you to question <br/>\neverything (we kinda are), that we get really knitpicky about every little <br/>\nword and detail.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe words you write can reveal shadow assumptions, and we change our <br/>\nthinking by examining our words. As a tip - avoid unexamined colloquialisms <br/>\nor making the assumption that we will &quot;know what you mean&quot; - case in point <br/>\nthe phrase &quot;all day&quot;.  Be as accurate and straightforward as possible, and <br/>\nerr on the side of the full story rather than brevity.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

(Wow, that&#39;s still painful to admit!)<br/>\n<br/>\nEvan, my oldest, played Phantasy Star Universe on his XBox. He had an account that was free that allowed him to play online with others, but was only good for one month. After the month was up, he&#39;d either have to pay for an account or he&#39;d lose all of his points and levels and have to start over again. Because of my overwhelm, we didn&#39;t pay. There was a whole group of friends he had for whom this was the case (the not paying - not sure about the overwhelm!); they kind of formed their own community. He stopped playing after about six months or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nYears later, recently, his brother found the game, and asked for an account. I was in a much more stable, honest place financially. Looked things over - yep! We can do that. Evan got an account, too, and started playing again. They both had SO MUCH fun on that game, got really high levels, upleveling their partner machines, etc. At one point, I apologized to Evan and told him I was very sorry to have not been willing to pay for the membership fee before. He said it really wasn&#39;t that big a deal to him, he was still XBox friends with some of the people from the free PSU accounts, and he understood.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeth has gone through phases of online gaming, with ToonTown and FusionFall. He&#39;ll play intently for a while, then not at all. He chose paying for Phantasy Star Universe over FusionFall, when we weren&#39;t able to pay for both. The only thing I&#39;m paying for now for him is XBOX Live, and because of gift cards we got for Christmas, he&#39;s good with that for a while.
