King Leonardo (a <br/>\nlion) was the ruler of Bongo Congo, whose major export was bongo drums (very <br/>\npopular at the time). Odie Cologne (a skunk) was Leonardo&#39;s faithful <br/>\nassistant, and a good &quot;man&quot; to have around — he was probably the only <br/>\ncharacter on the show competent to run things. Itchy Brother was Leonardo&#39;s <br/>\nbrother, a flea-bitten dimbulb driven mainly by jealousy of Leonardo&#39;s <br/>\nthrone. Biggie Rat was a high-level criminal (you could tell by his Edward G. <br/>\nRobinson accent) whose function was to plan and execute Itchy&#39;s coup <br/>\nattempts. Jackson Beck (Brutus in the 1960s Popeye cartoons and Perry White <br/>\nin The New Adventures of Superman) provided the voices of Leonardo and <br/>\nBiggie, while Allen Swift (Terrytoons&#39; Clint Clobber, and miscellaneous <br/>\nvoices in The Tom & Jerry Show) voiced Odie and Itchy. <br/>\n<br/>\nKing Leonardo was the first production of Total Television, which later <br/>\nchanged its name to Leonardo Productions. Under that name, it also produced <br/>\nTennessee Tuxedo and Underdog. Most of the actual animation was done in <br/>\nMexico by Gamma Productions, where The Jay Ward Studio also farmed out much <br/>\nof its work. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re mentioned in an article about where Itchy and Scratchy (the <br/>\ncartoon-within-a-cartoon on Simpsons) came from.    <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.silverbox.com/krusty/debate3.html\">http://www.silverbox.com/krusty/debate3.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma *","from":"&quot;zenmomma *&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Princess","postDate":"1015025322","msgId":5318,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY0OVdZNXBDeGxJQ1NzaVdkQmQwMDAwMWYyY0Bob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":5317,"nextInTopic":5319,"prevInTime":5317,"nextInTime":5319,"topicId":5302,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
