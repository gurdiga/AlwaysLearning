Do your kids see her much?<br/>\n<br/>\nOuch!  You just hit one of my buttons!  My first thought to the above was &quot;no way could I say that to my mom&quot;.  But why couldn&#39;t I?  She&#39;s really great in many ways, but is also terribly insecure, depressed, overly dependent on her grown children, and negative about a lot of things.  She has severe rheumatoid arthritis and takes multiple medications.  I feel guilty because I think I *should* bring her into my own home and take care of her.  I definitely do not want to do that though.  When we were kids she used to say, &quot;just promise not to put me in an old folks home.&quot;  Guess I probably did agree to that promise when I was a kid, and now feel like I&#39;m obligated to stick to it?  Wow, I think I just learned something!  I do believe that I must fulfill a promise that I made as a child, not understanding what I was actually agreeing too.  This could be a factor in my guilt complex.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she decided to move out of her house and into an apartment last year, all of us kids suggested that she at least consider some kind of senior housing complex.  I have met some seniors who live in &quot;adult housing&quot; and love it.  She said &quot;No, I don&#39;t like old people&quot;.  Sadly, she has become one of the type of old people she doesn&#39;t like- physically deteriorating and lonely.<br/>\n<br/>\nI *do* think about this in terms of what my actions are teaching my children.  I have this rosy picture of several generations living together as how it is supposed to be.  When I think of the realities of how it would be in our situation though, it is not so rosy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for rambling on so.
