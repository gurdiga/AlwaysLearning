My older two children (17 and 15) sleep in their own rooms but my youngest child (7) sleeps in my room. When we moved into our own house 4 years ago, she did have her own room but ended up coming in and sleeping with me every night. I didn&#39;t mind at all. The only issue was that I only have a twin bed as well so as she starting getting bigger, the room in the bed got smaller. Lol. I gave away her toddler bed (that had been in her room). And I bought a twin bed for her which I put into my room. She did sleep there for a while but I still found that she would climb in bed with me during the night. So, finally, I pushed our two twin beds together. It&#39;s worked perfectly. She&#39;s still right beside me but we both have room to move. I realize that my situation is different because I don&#39;t have a husband involved. I guess that I just wanted to say that I agree with the others that have responded saying that a twin bed pushed up right next to your bed might just solve your issues. Hope this helps. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSherri<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129999023,"authorName":"John and Amanda Slater","from":"John and Amanda Slater &lt;fourslaterz@...&gt;","profile":"fourslaterz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] co-sleeping: daughter wants, husband doesn&#39;t  want","postDate":"1264186892","msgId":49899,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYxMjI0My43ODUyOC5xbUB3ZWI1MzkwNi5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDE3NGRmOWRjMTAwMTIyMTA0NXExYTBiMGI4OGo4ZDVmNTMyZmZkMzViNDZlQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhqY2t0MCtjcmdtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MTc0ZGY5ZGMxMDAxMjIxMDQ1cTFhMGIwYjg4ajhkNWY1MzJmZmQzNWI0NmVAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":49898,"nextInTopic":49912,"prevInTime":49898,"nextInTime":49900,"topicId":49896,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We have a kingsize bed with a twin next to it.
