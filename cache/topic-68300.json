Do you  <br/>\nhave any Sudbury schools or Alternative Ed programs where you are? A  <br/>\ndifferent learning climate could be a transition to unschooling. And  <br/>\nit might help your husband see some possibilities for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems from your original post that grades have been a big deal and  <br/>\nher identity has been wrapped up in that. Now that she&#39;s at that  <br/>\ntricky age (not a kid, not a teen, not an adult) and her emotional  <br/>\nhealth is taking a dive, her grades are, too (and that can become a  <br/>\nvicious circle).  I think you&#39;re on the right track, wanting her to be  <br/>\nhappier than she is now, regardless of grades. Unschooling can help,  <br/>\nof course, but it can&#39;t against her will. She might need time to  <br/>\nrealize that you value her health and happiness more than her academic  <br/>\nachievement.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s 11, right? It seems rather young to be worried about academics,  <br/>\nalthough I know some kids are really quite serious about their  <br/>\nschoolwork. Maybe it&#39;s the only thing she has to hang on to (even if  <br/>\nher grades are messy), since she doesn&#39;t fit in well with the other  <br/>\nkids at school. At home, she could take all the time she needs to  <br/>\nreally dig into &quot;academics&quot; if she wanted to. Unschooling, in that  <br/>\nway, will look different for every child, depending on *their* needs.  <br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t have to (and really shouldn&#39;t ever) look like doing nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe needs a change, I think.

It helped to give him a bit of a pep talk, reassure him that I&#39;d do everything I could to get him together with friends, reassure him he could go back later if he still wanted, but really emphasize that I thought staying home from school was the best idea. <br/>\n<br/>\nStopping school can be really scary! It&#39;s familiar and predictable... better the devil you know. <br/>\n<br/>\nRather than just looking for unschoolers look at homeschool groups in general but also look for anything your daughter likes to do - the best way to meet people she&#39;ll connect with is going to be through her interests. It might also be a good idea to encourage her to think &quot;outside the box&quot; in terms of age. My kids friends run a range of ages from younger to decades older. School gets you in the habit of thinking of peers as people close in age, but in real life that&#39;s not how people make friends. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn a related note, does she like any online games?

I wonder why  <br/>\nshe wants to go back to a place where she&#39;s so miserable?<br/>\n<br/>\nI like Sandra&#39;s idea of you doing something *with* your daughter.  As  <br/>\nshe said, it&#39;s entirely possible she wouldn&#39;t hit it off with anyone  <br/>\nat a meetup, especially not right away. Relationships can take time to  <br/>\nbuild, even with unschoolers :-).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe two of you doing something together is a way to connect with her.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s not in-your-face and it might be a lot of fun. Does she play any  <br/>\ncomputer/online games? Have you thought of playing with her? Another  <br/>\nway to connect.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d also suggest reading the book that Pam Sorooshian recommends  <br/>\n&quot;Parent-Teen Breakthrough: A Relationship Approach&quot;. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Parent-Teen-Breakthrough-Relationship-Approach/dp/0452266165\">http://www.amazon.com/Parent-Teen-Breakthrough-Relationship-Approach/dp/0452266165</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt could really help.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jul 23, 2012, at 10:16 AM, janedonnelly402 wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I have given my daughter the choice of returning to school this  <br/>\n&gt; fall.

If one moves you may stay in touch other ways and visit now and then. Real friends are anyone you are friendly with that day or for a lifetime. Try and share with your daughter that sometimes *real* friends may even hurt another person feelings, not on purpose of course, at least you would hope not.
