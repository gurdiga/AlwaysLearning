At least that was my focus when I first heard about <br/>\nunschooling and it made it harder for me to really get unschooling.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, Yes, Yes. As soon as I read the topic I thought to myself, &#39;It&#39;s life, <br/>\nwhy create an &#39;unschooling strewing curriculum list&#39; for it.   Our home has <br/>\nbeen built of things / stuff we see and are interested in as we go about our <br/>\nlife.  I could have spent a lot of money strewing &#39;the list&#39; but instead I&#39;ve <br/>\nspent the money on Tails passions as they come up.   I envision every <br/>\nunschooling home looking quite different because each family&#39;s passions are <br/>\ndifferent.  For me, the importance has been Tails discovering the world and <br/>\nnot sitting in the house checking off the &#39;USCL&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI DO believe in having a home that is rich in environment but not in the <br/>\ncheck off sense.  I can totally see the old me, taking that &#39;USCL&#39; and <br/>\npurchasing everything on it in hopes of &#39;making&#39; unschooling happen.  To me, <br/>\nunschooling is life so it just happens for our family as we&#39;re tumbling down <br/>\nthe road.  I can see a person getting sidetracked with unschooling by <br/>\nfocusing on the &#39;USCL&#39;.  I can see them saying things like, &quot;but I had <br/>\neverything on the &#39;USCL&#39; and my child wants nothing to do with any of it&quot;. <br/>\nTo me, a home should be filled with the family&#39;s passions.  It should morph <br/>\nand move as the years go by.  If I were to create a list - WOW, I can&#39;t <br/>\nimagine how long it would truly be - I&#39;m thinking it would stretch around <br/>\nthe world over and over.  I&#39;m thinking that Tails would rather travel that <br/>\nworld discovering it for herself.  No &#39;USCL&#39; is needed for us; however, I <br/>\ncan see how it would help someone new to unschooling begin to &#39;see&#39; a <br/>\nsnapshot of an unschooling home.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Crystal in Albuquerque~<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://livingtheliquidlife.blogspot.com/\">http://livingtheliquidlife.blogspot.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41178,"nextTopicId":41122}}
