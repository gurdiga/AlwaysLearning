That is the basis of our householdâ€™s learning philosophy. From there, everything flows easily. Our homeschooling journey has been filled with work, surprise, frustration, but most of all, joy. Zoe has been able to have a wider variety of experiences, use more different modes of learning, and meet a more diverse group of people than she would have if she had been in school. We are especially lucky to be living in the great city of Chicago where we have taken advantage of its tremendous resources. In fact, for us the term homeschool is a bit of a misnomer; better labels for her process might be life learner or community-schooled.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWatching Zoe learn and grow through the years has confirmed that this philosophy is not just theoretical. All of the work you see in this transcript was freely chosen by Zoe; we acted as facilitators, chauffeurs, and sounding boards. Were we her teachers? Sure, just as Bill Nye, college professors, politicians, the neighbors, and our dog Steve, were her teachers.
