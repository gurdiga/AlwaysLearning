I said he is<br/>\n homeschooled but my dh was kinda freaked by the question, I had to<br/>\n tell him that homeschooling is legal is all 50 states. I wonder why<br/>\n they would ask that of my son? They also wanted to see where he slept.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIVe dealt with cps in several different ways and in different places. Ive done er nursing, taken foster parenting classes , and my 3 god children were taken away by cps 6months ago........one is still in foster care, other 2 were returned 3 weeks ago. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn most places cps really supports the parents and isnt out to get you . They look for several things but what is acceptable varies from places to place and things like finances are usualy taken into consideration. For example I was raised in Houston, TX and never once slept in my parents bed nor had I ever heard of any of my friends. Dh was raised in Lousiana and where he was it was very common for family members to sleep in a bed together, mom, dad kids, grandma and grandchilren, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway on the question of school.....if he was in school they would likely speak with his teacher, the nurse, etc to see if any concerns came up. Also they just like to know that the kids development is being supported. <br/>\nThe bed question. I think they do want to know he has a safe comfortable and clean place to sleep .....but I also think its a good excuse to be able to do a quick glance through the house. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like things are going to be ok. I would suggest taking pics TODAY . The yard, the area he sleeps, a cabinet full of food, and any areas that were messy. <br/>\nIn the off chance you end up in court and you have a cps worker tryt to say well the house was messy your lawyer may be able to use the pictures to show well yes it was messy ....we have some cars here and paper and markers laying out. <br/>\nIf they do come back out once again take pictures as soon as they leave. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck, <br/>\nNicole <br/>\n <br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nShape Yahoo! in your own image.
