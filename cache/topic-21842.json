Things have DEFINITELY changed around<br/>\nhere for them. They are completely self-motivated meaning they keep track of<br/>\nand do their homework (even as my husband says, &quot;No, no, you don&#39;t have to<br/>\ndo that...let&#39;s play music!&quot;). I can see my daughter looking at a trip away<br/>\nfrom her current adventure in the school system as being a big inconvenience<br/>\n:) For this past year we&#39;ve put our ideas for small trips on the table and<br/>\njust went with who wanted to go. My daughter stayed home for this last one<br/>\nto Flagstaff sledding (we live in Phoenix, so snow is a drive away). Anyway,<br/>\nhaving two in school (two are still unschooling) has definitely stretched my<br/>\nthinking...it was a lot easier with all of us in the same house. But it&#39;s<br/>\nbeen good for me...I like to be stretched. I do have to do some driving that<br/>\nI didn&#39;t before (they are in an art charter school...no bus), but for the<br/>\nrest of us at home, things are still fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nJacki</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126182534,"authorName":"nicole rodgers","from":"nicole rodgers &lt;fenom70@...&gt;","profile":"fenom70","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"vacations out of school","postDate":"1109453563","msgId":21842,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwMjI2MjEzMjQzLjY4MTA2LnFtYWlsQHdlYjMxMTA5Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDExMDk0NDg2NDEuNTEwLjY0ODI1Lm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":21843,"prevInTime":21841,"nextInTime":21843,"topicId":21842,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... compare to a trip to another continent to do something real with and for adults AND kids, something life-changing... ?

We are taking our two school-attending kids along with our unschooler to Virginia next week--not exactly a trip out of the country, but there will definitely be learning experiences!  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of course our high school girl is worried about the work she will miss.  I say, live and learn from real life, but she is a very studious and committed student..wants to go to Harvard!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the point of this all was that  we will be seeing, experiencing and doing all kinds of things that a week in a public school classroom can&#39;t replace.  To me, time together on the drive and time spent with exteded family are worth more than any test grade or reading assignment!  Am I crazy?  Share your thoughts on this with me.  Is it going to be too much to expect to go on living an unschooling lifestyle with kids who have chosen to go to school?<br/>\n<br/>\nNicole<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Yahoo!
