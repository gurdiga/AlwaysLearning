The shells have<br/>\nsharp edges and tend to tear an insect up from the inside out. Diatomaceous<br/>\nEarth is not harmful to humans or other large animals because they can not<br/>\ndo enough damage in our mostly liquid bodies to harm us. I use it a lot<br/>\nhere.. I put it on my goats for control of mites and lice.. I use it in the<br/>\nchicken nest boxes and on the birds themselves. I just take care not to<br/>\nbreath it or get it in my eyes or my animals eyes. I also use it in the<br/>\ngarden when I must. I think its a pretty good alternative to chemicals. It<br/>\nwould kill butterflies, bees and ladybugs too tho..<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie in MO</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7657,"nextTopicId":7597}}
