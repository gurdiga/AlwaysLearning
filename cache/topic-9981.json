I think you should sue, for medical bills, for pain and <br/>\nsuffering, and for loss of ...prestige or something?

First, <br/>\nI think they&#39;d get the ramp fixed faster, second, I think you genuinely have <br/>\na case on all those grounds, and finally, I think you have such a good case <br/>\nthat the hotel&#39;s insurance company will just settle.(and then make them fix <br/>\nthe ramp). <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you&#39;re feeling better soon.<br/>\nKathryn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9987,"nextTopicId":9961}}
