I&#39;m VERY new to all of this, but have been researching on the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; internet and am very interested in unschooling, but I confess I am so<br/>\n&gt; SCARED! What would you recommend to help someone who has come from an<br/>\n&gt; extremely controlling family background to begin to shift mentally into<br/>\n&gt; unschooling? This is our fourth year homeschooling and we have done mostly<br/>\n&gt; a Charlotte Mason Method. Over the years I have unlearned a lot and shed a<br/>\n&gt; lot of the mindsets I was raised with, but there is so much more shedding<br/>\n&gt; to be done. My older children are 9 and 11 and then I have a 2 yo and one<br/>\n&gt; on the way. With my 2 year old, I have done things very differently. I<br/>\n&gt; learned while I was pregnant with her of Attachment Parenting and fell in<br/>\n&gt; love with that philosophy of parenting so it has been a very different<br/>\n&gt; experience since we haven&#39;t had a focus on the conditioning we did with my<br/>\n&gt; other children whom I had at a very different time in my life. With my<br/>\n&gt; older two I feel more inept and confused as to how to transition from rules<br/>\n&gt; to principles...from external to internal motivation. I have so many fears<br/>\n&gt; and really want to learn how to confront those fears and move past them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you for reading,<br/>\n&gt; Christina.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":252464818,"authorName":"Christina","from":"&quot;Christina&quot; &lt;daharryrc@...&gt;","profile":"daharryrc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Newbie Looking for Help Deschooling","postDate":"1327440319","msgId":65230,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpmbjdqditqcTNxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":65247,"prevInTime":65229,"nextInTime":65231,"topicId":65230,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everyone!
