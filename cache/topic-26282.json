When you find a show you like you want to watch more of<br/>\nit, just like when you find a food you like you want to eat more of<br/>\nit. Of course prettymuch anything done in excess is going to cause<br/>\nproblems but few reasonable people eat a food they like until they&#39;re<br/>\nsick and if they do it once they will probably learn from their<br/>\nmistake. Anyhow I wanted to share what appears to happen in our house.<br/>\nMy son usually watches something closely the first time, if he doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwatch it closely it&#39;s obviously not that interesting and he usually<br/>\ndoes something else while watching or just watches something else. If<br/>\nit was interesting he will usually watch it again but this time we<br/>\npick out stuff that we didn&#39;t see the first time or he would like to<br/>\nfind out more about, the second showing usually brings more<br/>\nconversation about the show that just watching it once. Somtimes it<br/>\ngets watched even a 3rd or more times but usually not as closely or<br/>\nwhile doing something else, sometimes really interesting stuff gets<br/>\nwatched until it&#39;s almost memorized. <br/>\n  We rented Doogle last week (my son is 8) and it got 3 viewings. The<br/>\nfirst one we all watched thourally and then not as closely for the<br/>\nlater views, sometimes fast forwarding to the good parts like the<br/>\ntrain in mine scene. There are many comments in the movie where they<br/>\nrefer to other movies, even Thomas the Tank engine got a remark. That<br/>\nbrought about so much discussion about why the other shows were<br/>\nreferred to other than just the main themes of the movie.<br/>\n  We watch D&D on Disney late Saturday nights which was make several<br/>\nyears ago. Last episode they make a Star Wars reference and being that<br/>\nmy son is a big Star Wars fan he was elated and of course I had to<br/>\npoint out that it would have been a reference from what is now<br/>\nepisodes 4 or 5 but was 1 or 2 when the show was originally played. <br/>\n  My son sat through the whole King King movie (DVD rental)becuase he<br/>\nwanted to which I thought was pretty amazing, but it didn&#39;t get a<br/>\nsecond viewing from him and he didn&#39;t talk much about it afterwards.<br/>\nHoodwinked however was probably watched 4 times before it got returned<br/>\n(I think I watched it 3X myself!) and he has made references back to<br/>\nit.     <br/>\n    So for us TV or movies give us lots of connections and discussion<br/>\nstarters and it is usually on in our house although a lot of the time<br/>\nit&#39;s just background noise like a radio on playing music while we do<br/>\nother things. I know I personally really enjoy how to and shows that<br/>\ntour factories that show how things are made but I know there are more<br/>\nimportatnt things in live so I think my son will able to easily see<br/>\nthe same thing.

In retrospect, it was a resurrection battle with team  <br/>\ntactics, and we were acting out what the adults in our lives had  <br/>\nexperienced and talked about.    We were learning who played fair,  <br/>\nand who was quick and clever in our group.  Good young-primate  <br/>\nbehavior.    The building my second grade classroom was in was an old  <br/>\narmy barracks too.  I talked to Holly recently about how Quanset huts  <br/>\nand Army barracks were commonly used as cheap buildings after the  <br/>\nwar, and barracks could be purchased and moved.  That building was  <br/>\nmade more permanent and plastered over, and few would&#39;ve known it had  <br/>\nbeen a barracks, because gradually over the years the windows were  <br/>\nreplaced, the inside walls were panelled, and the outside was  <br/>\nstuccoed all the way to the ground.  By the time it was the art and  <br/>\nmusic building and people too young  to have been in WWII were having  <br/>\nkids, the memory was gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe played cops and robbers too.  At home we played Tarzan and Jane on  <br/>\nthe swingset, and there would be alligators or tigers on the ground  <br/>\nso we had to stay up on the crossbars and only cross with swings.   <br/>\nTHAT came from watching Tarzan movies on TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Fwd: July Freedom in Education Newsletter","postDate":"1153069785","msgId":26289,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMzQTQwOTNFLUNGNUMtNDhCMS05RTYzLUMwQTM0NENFOTU4MkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGU5ZGs4NStrMjhzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGU5ZGs4NStrMjhzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":26288,"nextInTopic":26290,"prevInTime":26288,"nextInTime":26290,"topicId":26282,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I get really antsy in front of the tv - I need a project to be able to watch for any length of time, even if I m facinated. -=- Me too.

Television is a major issue in most <br/>\nfamilies: when to watch it, what to watch, how long to watch it for, or <br/>\nif one should watch it at all.<br/>\nI do believe that television is slightly addictive - and this is as <br/>\ntrue for adults as is it is for children. Once one has sat oneself down <br/>\nto watch it, even if there is nothing interesting on, it becomes hard <br/>\nto turn it off again, and I know that I will usually end up watching <br/>\nthings which are not only a terrible waste of time, but also put images <br/>\nin my head which I could really do without!<br/>\n<br/>\n  It is quite clear that when a child is young television has a huge <br/>\neffect on them. If one stops to talk to a child nearly everything they <br/>\nsay is copying an advert they heard, or imitating something they saw on <br/>\ntelevision. The sights and sounds seem to fill their world, and the <br/>\nreason they are running round with toy guns pretending to blow each <br/>\nother up is usually due to something they saw on television. It is no <br/>\nwonder, then, that parents often try to protect their children from <br/>\nthis as much as they can, and I think that in general this is a good <br/>\nidea. <br/>\n<br/>\n  When I was young I don&#39;t remember there being a television around, and <br/>\nwhen I was a little older, we had a television but I would never watch <br/>\nit without my parent&#39;s permission, - it was usually pretty boring <br/>\nanyway. When I was about ten or eleven I went through a phase of <br/>\nwatching cartoons on television every day, and soon discovered that it <br/>\nnever left me feeling very good. The adverts aimed at children for <br/>\ntoys, sweets, junky drinks, and disgusting cereals were really quite <br/>\nshocking, and the gross noisy way in which the channel was supposed to <br/>\nappeal to children I found highly offensive, and not at all suited to <br/>\nmy tastes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes in other people&#39;s houses I would catch glimpses of the news <br/>\nwhich would fill me with a dread and horror of television which can&#39;t <br/>\neasily be described. I still remember how deeply appalled I was, when I <br/>\nsaw pictures of people who were dead and wounded being shown, whilst <br/>\nadults were casually eating their dinner. These shots would instantly <br/>\nreduce me to tears, and make me feel far too sick to eat, but to them <br/>\nit was considered an appropriate meal-time accompaniment!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am still shocked when I see murders being coolly discussed by the <br/>\nnews presenters without reducing them to tears, and after having <br/>\nannounced the deaths of so many people they put a cheery smile on their <br/>\nfaces and say &#39;now time for the sport&#39;. I don&#39;t think anyone is aware <br/>\nof the damage that television must do, putting ideas into people&#39;s <br/>\nheads that they would not otherwise have, hardening people in an area <br/>\nwhere they should not be hardened, and turning terrible tragedy into <br/>\nidle entertainment.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So I really don&#39;t think that television is the main culprit, but <br/>\nrather what is shown on it. If television showed things which were as <br/>\ngood as things they now show are bad, then television could become a <br/>\nwonderful thing which inspired people and left them feeling better. One <br/>\ndoes occasionally see a good programme which shows one that this is the <br/>\ncase. But even then to watch it in moderation is probably still a good <br/>\nidea, especially as regards children. After all, as Dad says in the <br/>\narticle below, television only stimulates a child&#39;s brain, whereas <br/>\nideally children should be able to learn whilst feeling and touching <br/>\nand moving and interacting at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, I hope you enjoy the article.<br/>\n<br/>\n Best wishes<br/>\n<br/>\n Wendy<br/>\n<br/>\n Television: Junk Food for the Mind<br/>\n<br/>\n  This is an article that I wrote about fifteen years ago, but never had <br/>\npublished. I come across it from time to time when tidying up my <br/>\noffice, and thought perhaps that it deserved a wider audience. The <br/>\ntitle, in particular, is popular with members of my family. I hope that <br/>\nit does not come across as a rant against television, but rather as a <br/>\nreminder that, like other aspects of modern technology, one has to be <br/>\ncareful about how one introduces children to television.<br/>\n<br/>\n  A few years ago parents who gave their children healthy food were <br/>\noften considered to be kill-joys and cranks. Now, everyone, from the <br/>\nmedical profession to people working in the food industry recognises <br/>\nthat a diet of crisps and fizzy drinks is bad for children’s health and <br/>\nincreases the risk of contracting life-threatening ailments in later <br/>\nlife: everyone now agrees that the body is designed in such a way that <br/>\nit requires a constant supply of nutritious food over the first <br/>\neighteen or so years of life if it is to grow and develop properly, and <br/>\nthat a junk food diet does not supply those needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n  What is true for the body is even more true for the mind. A human <br/>\nbeing is one of the most complex things in Nature, taking longer to <br/>\nreach maturity than just about any other animal. This long period of <br/>\ndevelopment is required principally not by the body, but by the mind, <br/>\nwhich starts off blank and proceeds to acquire vast amounts of <br/>\ninformation and knowledge as a child grows up.<br/>\n<br/>\n  In order to acquire this knowledge the mind needs constant sensory <br/>\nstimulation, and this stimulation needs to be constantly maintained <br/>\nover a long period of time. The natural world provides a child with <br/>\never-changing, dynamic stimulation, of almost infinite variety, <br/>\ncompared to which the experience of watching television is sadly <br/>\nlacking. Instead of having a multi-dimensional experience of sight, <br/>\nsound, taste, smell, touch and an interaction with another responsive <br/>\nhuman being, a child sitting in front of a television screen is largely <br/>\ninactive, is having only the senses of sight and sound stimulated, and <br/>\nis being given no chance to respond.<br/>\n<br/>\n  To the developing mind this is equivalent to sensory deprivation, and <br/>\nwhilst the odd hour of watching television can be accommodated in the <br/>\nmidst of an otherwise full life, a child who spends a significant <br/>\nproportion of their time watching television is inevitably missing out <br/>\non the stimulation and input that they require in order to develop <br/>\nnormally.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The problem is compounded by the fact that the input that children <br/>\nreceive from television is not equally deficient in all aspects: <br/>\nchildren receive intense visual and audio input – which fills their <br/>\nheads with sights and sounds – whilst other senses are not stimulated <br/>\nat all. This seems to have a detrimental effect on children’s power of <br/>\nimagination.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The nature of the programmes watched gives further cause for concern. <br/>\nIt is often said that even though there are some programmes that are <br/>\nnot very good, this is compensated for to a certain extent by the fact <br/>\nthat there are thoughtful documentaries, drama programmes, and <br/>\neducational programmes available for children to watch, which represent <br/>\na more acceptable face of television. Interestingly, in the early days <br/>\nof television there do appear to have been more of these sorts of <br/>\nprogrammes, but television has become a victim of its own shortcomings: <br/>\nchildren brought up on television do not have the attention span, the <br/>\nlanguage skills, or the level of understanding required to appreciate <br/>\nthought-provoking or subtle broadcasting, and therefore producers of <br/>\nchildren’s television have had to make their programmes ever more <br/>\ninane, garish, and banal in order to maintain their audience figures.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Further problems are caused by television advertisements which <br/>\nessentially seek to sell children products before they are old enough <br/>\nto be able to realise that one should not believe everything that one <br/>\nsees on a television screen.<br/>\n<br/>\n  One argument put forward in favour of television is the social <br/>\neducation that children can get from watching contemporary dramas such <br/>\nas soap operas. However, these programmes may, in fact, do even more <br/>\nharm than those which more obviously bear no relationship to everyday <br/>\nlife. A young teenager immersed in a world of television soap operas <br/>\nmay imagine that they know everything that there is to be known about <br/>\nthings such as bereavement, drug addiction, relationships, and <br/>\nchildbirth, but watching actors talking about these things in the <br/>\ntwo-dimensional world of television is far removed from real-life <br/>\nexperience, and when young people find themselves caught up in these <br/>\nsituations, they find that they have nothing substantial to fall back <br/>\non if their view of life has been formed by television.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Of course, television is a factor of modern life and young people have <br/>\nto be introduced to it at some time or other: but not necessarily when <br/>\nthey are very young. Children had enough to keep them fully occupied <br/>\nbefore the advent of modern technology. Things such as acquiring <br/>\nlanguage skills, learning social skills, and developing an <br/>\nunderstanding of the natural world are just as important now as they <br/>\never were and still require as much time to pick up as in the past. <br/>\nTelevision does not help in this process: it distracts children from <br/>\nmore fruitful activities, it stultifies their imaginations, it <br/>\nover-stimulates one area of the mind to the detriment of others, and <br/>\nabove all it is a waste of precious time.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The comparison of television with junk food is appropriate because <br/>\njust as junk food is designed to look like real food, but fails to <br/>\nprovide the body with the nourishment that it requires, so television <br/>\nappears to be interesting and informative, but in reality fails to <br/>\nprovide children with the level of stimulation that they require.<br/>\n<br/>\n Gareth Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n --------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour letters and comments are welcome.
