What was important?<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter spending some time thinking about it, I knew that I wanted four things for my children, with respect to their education. I wanted them to be able to read, write, compute, and look stuff up.<br/>\nThose goals were achieved very early on. From that point forward, they choose their own goals.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again, Sandra & Helen! <br/>\n<br/>\nPS: Sawyer Fredericks, winner of The Voice, is also an Unschooled kid. Good for him! wink emoticon<br/>\n_________________<br/>\n<br/>\nI’ve always been grateful that Monica was willing to be the distribution point for that information.  <br/>\nOnce web pages were available, we could put the information online and send links, and the rest is…. history and current events. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe writer of that Christian Science Monitor article, Stephanie Hanes, did a good job.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Article today about unschooling","postDate":"1455510293","msgId":76749,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVEQjAxMTgzLTY5QTEtNEI4Qi1BNjk3LTA0NTBDMEM5NkY4OEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":76750,"prevInTime":76748,"nextInTime":76750,"topicId":76749,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The Christian Science Monitor has a long a very decent article on unschooling today.

These threats are larger than any threat posed by a small group opting out of formal education. But strong public schools can be a bulwark against the broader threats to social cohesion.”<br/>\n__________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nPeopl esee others who disagree as an existential threat?  <br/>\nYES.  The educational policy makers see people who criticize or opt out of public schools as a threat.  <br/>\nHe seems to have missed the irony of hie dramatic statement. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Education/2016/0214/Free-range-education-Why-the-unschooling-movement-is-growing?cmpid=gigya-fb\">http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Education/2016/0214/Free-range-education-Why-the-unschooling-movement-is-growing?cmpid=gigya-fb</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76684,"nextTopicId":76751}}
