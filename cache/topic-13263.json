So on <br/>\nthe day she would have died anyway, my husband and I drove her to the <br/>\nvet&#39;s office.  They used a needle and she died.  But that last few <br/>\nminutes of her life, putting her out on the table and getting the shots <br/>\nwere not nice.  That was the hardest part of all.

To<br/>\ntake the cat to the vet&#39;s office was going to be much cheaper, but the cat<br/>\nowner felt it would be too stressful on the cat and wanted it euthanized at<br/>\nhome.

She felt that trying to inject<br/>\nan angry non-anesthetized cat would be even more stressful on the cat than<br/>\na few moments in the box.  She also mentioned that many cats were quite<br/>\nrelaxed in the box and would watch what she was doing until the meds took<br/>\nhold.  She felt that the handling of the animal prior to anesthesia really<br/>\nhad more impact on the animal&#39;s reaction to being confined, than actually<br/>\nbeing *in* the confined space.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI absolutely hate tank inductions!  There is too much stress on the cat, not<br/>\nto mention the gas exposure to everyone in the vicinity (not to mention OSHA<br/>\nfrowns on this). My chamber sits in the cupboard, and I haven&#39;t had to gas a<br/>\n cat in ages and I deal with alot of nasty psycho cats! DKT (injectable<br/>\ncombination) is a dream come true, to not only me, but my staff (all that<br/>\nexposure to iso with the tank) and the cat (no stage II excitement, no<br/>\ncatecholamine release, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I will hopefully never put another cat through that again. IMHO<br/>\nthose boxes are a throwback to the 40&#39;s and should be used only in the most<br/>\nextreme of extremes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, if one can get hands on the cat well enough to shove it into the<br/>\nbox, one can get their hands on it well enough to do an IM injection.  The<br/>\nstress that those poor cats have to go through in the tank before they<br/>\ncollapse is far more than any injectable drug technique we would use, so the<br/>\nfact that it may have been fractious and angry beforehand really holds not<br/>\nmuch water.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIs your friend a licensed vet tech (CVT, LVT, or RVT) or a vet assistant?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJanet</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523757,"authorName":"Pam Hartley","from":"&quot;Pam Hartley&quot; &lt;pamhartley@...&gt;","profile":"pdhartley2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Animal Euthanasia","postDate":"1049555587","msgId":13299,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwNDA1MTUxMy5oMzVGRDhYVzAxNjQyMEBtdGE0LnJjbnN0eC5zd2JlbGwubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":13294,"nextInTopic":13307,"prevInTime":13298,"nextInTime":13300,"topicId":13263,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I would seriously doubt that she <br/>\nwould be paying much attention to her surroundings, past knowing that she <br/>\nwas in a warm box with her favorite cushion.  When my beloved basset came <br/>\ndown with lymphatic sarcoma, her last few days were basically <br/>\nimmobile.  She grunted in effort trying to cross the floor and rarely moved <br/>\nonce down.  Thankfully, we were able to afford the services of a vet who <br/>\ncame to our home and helped her pass on with us next to her.  The woman <br/>\nwith the ill cat, (again, according to the post) has barely enough money <br/>\nfor food and cannot afford the luxury I was able to purchase.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think I could personally do it, but if she&#39;s strong enough I still <br/>\nfeel it would be the most humane and un-tutored method of helping her cat <br/>\npass on.  Much more humane than cervical dislocation or a more <br/>\n&#39;projectile-based&#39; solution to her emotion-ridden problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the gassing of cats to work on them, my neighbor (a vet tech <br/>\ncurrently on maternity leave) says that when she worked with my vet, a few <br/>\ncats would get angry by the box-anesthesia procedure, but that those cats <br/>\nwere usually angry whenever they were seen.  She felt that trying to inject <br/>\nan angry non-anesthetized cat would be even more stressful on the cat than <br/>\na few moments in the box.  She also mentioned that many cats were quite <br/>\nrelaxed in the box and would watch what she was doing until the meds took <br/>\nhold.  She felt that the handling of the animal prior to anesthesia really <br/>\nhad more impact on the animal&#39;s reaction to being confined, than actually <br/>\nbeing *in* the confined space.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope I am never placed in the difficult situation this woman is in.<br/>\nHeidi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I prefer a person who will burn the flag and wrap themselves in the <br/>\nconstitution to a person who will burn the constitution and wrap themselves <br/>\nin the flag&quot; --- Molly Ivins</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Animal Euthanasia","postDate":"1049493578","msgId":13284,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE2Ni4xZTVjMjkwNS4yYmJmNWE0YUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":13280,"nextInTopic":13287,"prevInTime":13283,"nextInTime":13285,"topicId":13263,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/4/2003 2:44:54 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...
