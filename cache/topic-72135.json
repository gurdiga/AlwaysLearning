Right now this is<br/>\na thing he is FASCINATED by, and that is great! And I don&#39;t think I&#39;d<br/>\nhave thought of breaking down the fear and considering those questions<br/>\nlike that without this list, so for that many thanks to everyone. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet despite that logical decision, which I am logically happy with,<br/>\nI have that back-of-head niggle. Pam said this:<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\nThere are so many things we&#39;d like to protect our children from and we&#39;d        <br/>\nlike so much to do everything exactly right. Right?<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nand also<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\nBe careful about living a life ruled by unreasonable fear or you&#39;ll be          <br/>\noverprotective and controlling of your kids. That won&#39;t go well for your        <br/>\nrelationship with your child, especially as the child gets older. Start<br/>\nnow to practice using your emotions (fear and love) to inform your<br/>\nintellect, but use your intellect to make decisions. Say to yourself, <br/>\n&quot;Yes, I have some fear about this, but I understand where that fear <br/>\nis coming from and I don&#39;t think it is a reasonable reaction to <br/>\nthis situation so I&#39;m not going      <br/>\nto make my decisions based on it. I am going to decide based on what<br/>\nmakes sense to me logically.&quot;    <br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of which I think really hit the nail on the head for me. Thank you.<br/>\nI hope that repeating some version of that to myself every time I start<br/>\ngetting that worried niggle in the back of my head will help shift it!<br/>\nAnd keep noticing the learning  :) <br/>\n<br/>\nThat quote about fear also brings to mind a comparison with physical<br/>\nexploration. My fear inclines/inclined me to say &quot;careful!&quot; a lot or to<br/>\nprevent him from doing certain &#39;risky&#39; things. My logical decision is to<br/>\nlet him explore (and be ready to catch if necessary, without hovering<br/>\nfearfully), to make sure that really risky things (household chemicals) are<br/>\nout of reach, and help with things he can&#39;t quite manage safely yet<br/>\n(knives, matches). That&#39;s something that has become much easier as I&#39;ve<br/>\nwatched him carefully explore the world -- and, sure, take the odd<br/>\ntumble! (Trying, waiting, and watching :) ) <br/>\n<br/>\nIt turns out that swinging on the unfastened stairgate is a great way of<br/>\nlearning about centre of gravity (he never went further than he could<br/>\nback up from, and I sat a couple of steps down and chatted with him,<br/>\njust in case), and that at 18 months he can carefully and safely light a<br/>\ncandle, though he hasn&#39;t yet the dexterity to light the match without<br/>\nhelp. Basing decisions on fear, rather than on watching *my* specific<br/>\nchild, wouldn&#39;t have let either of us find that out. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I can now apply that same logic elsewhere... like to the iPad!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJuliet</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"","from":"&lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: Toddler, iPad, observations, and request!","postDate":"1378681078","msgId":72144,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGwwaXZkbCs4cTk1bmdAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDc0N0YyRTlBLUQxNUUtNDNDNC04QThGLUI2OTA4NkREOUQ3RkBlYXJ0aC5saT4="},"prevInTopic":72143,"nextInTopic":72174,"prevInTime":72143,"nextInTime":72145,"topicId":72135,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

After several months of reading this list, I am supporting his enthusiasm rather than restricting it with worry about &quot;screens&quot; etc, which is lovely. A couple of specific incidents:<br>\n<br>\nHe wanted to play with it while we were on the way down to lunch, and stayed engaged for ages while I started to worry about him being hungry - he wasn&#39;t interested in leaving and coming to eat, and at 18 months he is not a tidy enough eater for me to be happy taking it with us! So instead of pushing him into coming down to the kitchen, I thought for a bit, and instead went to get him a big plate of (non-sticky...) snacks and brought it up. He stopped playing for a bit and we shared the snacks happily, then he went back to playing with a big grin. A happy moment for both of us instead of upset and me carrying him down to lunch. Thanks to this list for this idea!<br>\n<br>\nHe&#39;s been playing a lot with the Spotify app, switching repeatedly between different songs, and I could swear he&#39;s learning to time it so that they stop/start at the &quot;right&quot; musical place. I tried to do the same thing to show his dad and it was hard! (There&#39;s a bunch of other things I&#39;ve noticed him practising and experimenting and getting the hang of, too, but that was one that stuck out to me.) I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have been so aware of that sort of learning if I hadn&#39;t read so much on here about how learning is everywhere, and opened my mind more to see that. So another thank you to the list there. <br>\n<br>\nDespite all of this though, I&#39;m still struggling a bit with a little internal voice saying &quot;at 18 months surely he SHOULDN&#39;T be spending half an hour or an hour at a time with a computer?&quot;. I am trying not to let this influence my behaviour. And he does do plenty of other things with his time too; we play lots of physical games together, read books, draw, sing, run round the park and garden, etc etc. But having decided intellectually that I/we are very happy with the way he&#39;s playing and learning and enjoying himself with the iPad and that we want to support that, I would rather not have that back-of-head worry bothering me! Any suggestions for getting rid of that or is it just a case of hanging on in there and continuing to watch and enjoy his learning and fun, and eventually I won&#39;t think that way even in the anxious &quot;are we doing right by him?&quot; back of my mind?<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nJuliet</div></span></blockquote></div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":254796796,"authorName":"Virginia Warren","from":"Virginia Warren &lt;vafnord@...&gt;","profile":"vafnord","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Toddler, iPad, observations, and request!","postDate":"1378666577","msgId":72143,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBS1g5OGZobXpLaXBuK2ZudTJFc0x1MUN1UktlazVhUUtGOV9KOUN4Z01hMVNveXpPQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBT09UYVhOcSstKzRWYWZQLWFmN0FjM3dwVGt3Tjczb0hOK3NRdXdRV0JrQ2pSdHRzZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDc0N0YyRTlBLUQxNUUtNDNDNC04QThGLUI2OTA4NkREOUQ3RkBlYXJ0aC5saT4JPENBT09UYVhOcSstKzRWYWZQLWFmN0FjM3dwVGt3Tjczb0hOK3NRdXdRV0JrQ2pSdHRzZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":72139,"nextInTopic":72144,"prevInTime":72142,"nextInTime":72144,"topicId":72135,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If you lost all your books, but had your iPad, you could still read.

But, even if you weren&#39;t able to see the learning, there is learning happening ALL the time. So keep that in mind.<br>\n<br>But there is something more. Play along with me here. What if there is NO learning happening when he&#39;s playing with the ipad? So what? Do you think he needs to be learning something every single minute of the day? What if that is a big blank spot in his day where no neurons are firing (except those keeping him alive, of course)? What if? <br>\n<br>What&#39;s his purpose of existence right now? To build up his brain so he&#39;ll reach his maximum capacity of intelligence? American parent are obsessed with how smart their kids are. Are you? Or can he just play with it because he wants to? Isn&#39;t the fact that he wants to play with it enough? Are you worried that he&#39;s &quot;missing out&quot; on the learning he&#39;d be doing during that time? He could be learning more? Better stuff? More useful learning that would help him more as he grows up? Make him more successful? What&#39;s the point? (Things to ask yourself, not answer here.)<br>\n<br>Or - think about this. More than missing out on other learning he could be gaining, do you secretly in your heart of hearts still think it is actually doing him damage? Destroying brain cells? Most recent article I read (just this morning) was about how a group of old people playing video games increased their ability to pay attention to more information at once and that ability was generalized beyond just the video game and beyond the time they continued playing. They had not previously played and in the study they only played 3 hours a week for a month and the benefits to their brain function were measurable. <br>\n<br>Imagine this:<br><br>A toddler is interested in books. The parents are concerned that that is not a good activity for their child who should be doing other things that are more developmentally appropriate. So they restrict his book time and, being kind parents, they try to distract him from books by keeping them out of his sight and by finding him many other fun things to do in place of them.<br>\n<br>Is this sensible? An iPad is like a wonderful book to a child these days. To deny them the experience of growing up with something like this is, in my opinion, not different than keeping books away from them. It comes out of an overwhelming love for the child that makes you want to do something, anything, to protect him from any and all possible harm ever. That is fear-based thinking, though, and it is better for your child if you choose to live a life in which you embrace those things your child loves and find the joy and sweetness in them.<br>\n<br>There are so many things we&#39;d like to protect our children from and we&#39;d like so much to do everything exactly right. Right?<br><br>That&#39;s why people get very very defensive about food or tv or other things they&#39;ve glommed onto as ways to protect their child! Protect! It comes from fear. It makes them feel better to think they are taking control of something to protect their child because we all know that things happen that are out of our control and it terrifies us that something happen to our little ones.<br>\n<br>Be careful about living a life ruled by unreasonable fear or you&#39;ll be overprotective and controlling of your kids. That won&#39;t go well for your relationship with your child, especially as the child gets older. Start now to practice using your emotions (fear and love) to inform your intellect, but use your intellect to make decisions. Say to yourself, &quot;Yes, I have some fear about this, but I understand where that fear is coming from and I don&#39;t think it is a reasonable reaction to this situation so I&#39;m not going to make my decisions based on it. I am going to decide based on what makes sense to me logically.&quot; <br>\n<br>Have courage. Courage means choosing to do something in spite of fear.<br><br>-pam<br><br><br></span></blockquote></div></div>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Toddler, iPad, observations, and request!","postDate":"1378657240","msgId":72136,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEMyQTQ2RDczLTg2QzAtNDFGOS04MEIzLUE3Mzk0OTUzNDlGOUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDc0N0YyRTlBLUQxNUUtNDNDNC04QThGLUI2OTA4NkREOUQ3RkBlYXJ0aC5saT4=","referencesHeader":"PDc0N0YyRTlBLUQxNUUtNDNDNC04QThGLUI2OTA4NkREOUQ3RkBlYXJ0aC5saT4="},"prevInTopic":72135,"nextInTopic":72137,"prevInTime":72135,"nextInTime":72137,"topicId":72135,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

After several months of reading this list, I am supporting his enthusiasm rather than restricting it with worry about &quot;screens&quot; etc, which is lovely. A couple of specific incidents:<br/>\n<br/>\nHe wanted to play with it while we were on the way down to lunch, and stayed engaged for ages while I started to worry about him being hungry - he wasn&#39;t interested in leaving and coming to eat, and at 18 months he is not a tidy enough eater for me to be happy taking it with us! So instead of pushing him into coming down to the kitchen, I thought for a bit, and instead went to get him a big plate of (non-sticky...) snacks and brought it up. He stopped playing for a bit and we shared the snacks happily, then he went back to playing with a big grin. A happy moment for both of us instead of upset and me carrying him down to lunch. Thanks to this list for this idea!<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s been playing a lot with the Spotify app, switching repeatedly between different songs, and I could swear he&#39;s learning to time it so that they stop/start at the &quot;right&quot; musical place. I tried to do the same thing to show his dad and it was hard! (There&#39;s a bunch of other things I&#39;ve noticed him practising and experimenting and getting the hang of, too, but that was one that stuck out to me.) I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have been so aware of that sort of learning if I hadn&#39;t read so much on here about how learning is everywhere, and opened my mind more to see that. So another thank you to the list there. <br/>\n<br/>\nDespite all of this though, I&#39;m still struggling a bit with a little internal voice saying &quot;at 18 months surely he SHOULDN&#39;T be spending half an hour or an hour at a time with a computer?&quot;. I am trying not to let this influence my behaviour. And he does do plenty of other things with his time too; we play lots of physical games together, read books, draw, sing, run round the park and garden, etc etc. But having decided intellectually that I/we are very happy with the way he&#39;s playing and learning and enjoying himself with the iPad and that we want to support that, I would rather not have that back-of-head worry bothering me! Any suggestions for getting rid of that or is it just a case of hanging on in there and continuing to watch and enjoy his learning and fun, and eventually I won&#39;t think that way even in the anxious &quot;are we doing right by him?&quot; back of my mind?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJuliet</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":72094,"nextTopicId":72161}}
