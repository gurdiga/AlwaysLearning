A couple behavior-type","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2142639450\">I&#39;ve been reading for months, but have posted only once. I am Angela, mother to three kids: Joseph, 8; Hannah, 5; and Miriam, 2 1/2.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple behavior-type issues have pooped up recently that I need help with. I know I&#39;m not reacting in a helpful way. I feel like they are bringing up stuff from my childhood, and that seems to be getting in the way of my doing anything that is remotely helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 8YO has recently discovered spit bubbles. I remember spit bubbles and liking to make them. But what I remember more is how my oldest sister used to torment me by pinning me down and letting her spit drip out of her mouth and sucking it up just at the last minute. Except of course for the times that she didn&#39;t do it in time and it dropped right in my face. So even though Joseph is keeping his spit to himself -- you know, other than the fact that he can&#39;t resist doing it anywhere, anytime including the dinner table and in the middle of conversations -- all I can picture is spit being dripped in my face. I feel like I&#39;m constantly hissing at him to stop it. I&#39;ve been trying to give him a more gentle &quot;keep it in your mouth, please.&quot; But when he has continued, I have sent him away from the dinner table. I get frustrated and/or embarrassed when he does it in the middle of conversations with me or other adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what&#39;s a constructive way to deal with it? I know it&#39;s not fair that I&#39;m heaping my sisters behavior on him, making his current (and likely fleeting) fascination with the texture and surface tension of his own saliva into something that it&#39;s not. But I can&#39;t help the fact that it grosses me out, and I&#39;m letting that get in the way of any sort of constructive redirection in the situations when it really isn&#39;t appropriate for him to be doing it. Thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other issue we have going on over here is that my 5YO has taken to  tormenting my 2 1/2YO. She seems to thrill in scaring her. Sometimes it&#39;s with hiding and jumping out at her. And sometimes it following her around slowly with a blank expression (with or without noise), sort of zombie-like. I think there are a couple of things going on here: Hannah&#39;s a little bored with Joseph at camp (though it was happening before, the frequency has picked up), and Miriam was recently injured in an accident. Why I think this may be relative is that the result is at least two-fold: it has made Miriam much more cautious and less thrill-seeking, therefor more sensitive/reactive to that sort of play; and, Miriam has, by necessity, gotten lots of one-on-one attention, even if just for bandage changes and doctor&#39;s visits. I think it&#39;s hard to be the middle child under the best of circumstances, but having her little sister get so much attention can&#39;t help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been trying to stay more on top of the girls when they are together, so that I can jump in and redirect the play if I see it heading in that direction. I&#39;ve also been trying to give Hannah her own one-on-one attention to try and fill up her emotional cup. BUT when it happens, I react badly. I send her to her room. I lecture. I sometimes yell.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the youngest of three with a bully for an older sister, I remember that feeling of being tormented (it stretched far beyond the spit). AND I probably AM being more protective of Miriam since the accident.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve explained to Hannah that I won&#39;t let her torment her sister, the same way I wouldn&#39;t let Joseph do the same thing to her. I&#39;ve explained that she doesn&#39;t want her relationship with her sister to be one based on fear. But she&#39;s 5. I&#39;m not sure my explanations are anything other than noise to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in the instances of torment that I can&#39;t head off at the pass with  closer contact and more love, affection, attention, good sources of protein, etc. showered on my middle child, what&#39;s the reaction from me that will be most effective?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.
