However had I a family member with a <br/>\nmedical condition I might find even an exploitative show worth it or <br/>\njustified. There but for the grace of God go I.....In truth I assumed the <br/>\nfirst reason was money (for anyone who agrees to go on this type of show), <br/>\nbut I was wondering if there were more reasons as well, and if the <br/>\nexperience fulfilled those reasons, given that her younger son has been <br/>\ndamaged, according again to her blog. I hope the fees were enormous and <br/>\nbless both families for a long time to come.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever the larger discussion was about the perception of unschooling in the <br/>\nwider community, and people here expressing doubts that Heather was <br/>\npracticing unschooling *in the way it is discussed here*. There are many <br/>\nhome schooling people who do tons of volunteering at local, State and even <br/>\nnational levels. There are many people who are lovely parents and nice and <br/>\nkind and generous. But that doesn&#39;t make them unschoolers, especially as we <br/>\ndefine unschooling here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t trying to imply that she was a bad person or mercenary, Pam, and <br/>\nI&#39;m sorry if it came across that way. I&#39;m sure she is a very nice and <br/>\ndedicated parent and teacher. She is clearly a joyful person and it sounds <br/>\nlike her kids are joyful, creative and vivid people too. I already said her <br/>\nschool as she describes it, sounds like the very best kind of school for <br/>\nchildren. I would add it sounds like the very best model of a school for <br/>\npeople interested in school reform.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut on this list, for the purposes of discussion and helping people move <br/>\ntoward unschooling, someone whose language is full of the word &quot;teach&quot; over <br/>\nand over, whose practice discusses classes and school subjects and wanting <br/>\nto discover children&#39;s learning styles in order to teach them in the right <br/>\nway for them (as positive an idea as that is in a school context), who <br/>\ncontinues to call herself a &quot;teacher&quot; and freely uses labels (positive and <br/>\nnegative) for her children in public writing, is not unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey aren&#39;t unschooling in the fully committed way that so many of the long <br/>\ntime unschoolers on this list have been for so long. In some respects <br/>\nsomeone who so &quot;close but no cigar&quot; to unschooling can cause even more <br/>\nconfusion in an arena where there are already self-designated experts out <br/>\nthere promoting extremely fuzzy definitions and letting the word <br/>\n&quot;unschooling&quot; come to mean anything that is other than paralleling the <br/>\npublic school curriculum.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end people have the right to call themselves anything they want. The <br/>\nFirst Amendment, isn&#39;t it? To say any crazy thing you like, as long as it is <br/>\nnot inciting someone to commit a crime. Someone I know talks about &quot;her <br/>\nunschooling&quot; as being that she teaches only what she, the Mom, is interested <br/>\nin rather than following another curriculum. Her language is full of &quot;teach&quot; <br/>\nwords and her self and how satisfied she is with herself and how much <br/>\nhappier she is with this - and it is a step forward from where she was, now <br/>\nmuch more relaxed doing what I would happily call &quot;eclectic unit studies&quot; <br/>\nrather than unschooling. If she were to come here or UD or .info or even <br/>\nRUNing she might discover that she is further from genuine, authentic <br/>\nunschooling than she believes herself to be. But she might read Heather&#39;s <br/>\nblog entry and start to think that she could go further, not towards <br/>\ngenuine, authentic unschooling, but in her teaching practices. Or not, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend, who is kind and lovely and a volunteer and socially aware, but <br/>\nnot really an unschooler, is only hurting me by calling herself so in the <br/>\nsense that there is a small wall between us made out of the bricks of my <br/>\njudgment around her wrong (IMO) use of a word that represents something that <br/>\nis the heart of my life. I have this devil desire to set her straight, but I <br/>\nrefrain because the other parts of our friendship are so very valuable to <br/>\nme, and all I can really do is tell my own stories in the context of real <br/>\nconversations. Maybe one day she will ask. The difference is that she is a <br/>\nprivate person. She isn&#39;t on national, perhaps international television, <br/>\nmangling or diluting or obfuscating for the uninitiated what unschooling <br/>\nreally can be. She isn&#39;t making public statements defining unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect, going back to &quot;why&#39;d she do it&quot;, that part of Heather&#39;s own <br/>\nagenda was to promote the school reform and home schooling movements. Maybe <br/>\nshe saw an opportunity to highlight the possibilities of a better <br/>\neducational life for children that her kind of wonderful child focussed <br/>\nteaching methods can create. Did she succeed in that, or was she the victim <br/>\nof a predictable desire to record apparent conflict (which is what &quot;sells <br/>\ntickets&quot;) on the part of the producers which ultimately betrayed her and the <br/>\nother unfortunate mother? As someone with an interest in how television <br/>\ncommunicates, and how the language of television and mass media can affect <br/>\nthe content of the message, these are questions I am interested in.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe just the fact that she was on the show will bring the curious to her <br/>\nblog, and that she have a positive effect on some child&#39;s life somewhere if <br/>\nthat child&#39;s parent chooses to relax and support their child&#39;s passion. I <br/>\nhope so, and I really would expect so.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that doesn&#39;t mean that I have to call even well intentioned teaching <br/>\n&quot;unschooling&quot;, especially here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Not that I care about what other people think. More for<br/>\nthose who struggle with it.==--<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw part of this episode and also another one that had a family who<br/>\nidentified themselves as unschoolers. I can speak as someone who<br/>\naspires to unschool and is still learning and who has a lot of<br/>\n&quot;doubters&quot; in my life right now. It seemed to me not to represent the<br/>\nunschooling philosophy well. Actually it may have more been that the<br/>\nother family was SO against it (which is the premise of the show -- to<br/>\nfind family&#39;s VERY different from each other, seemingly opposites) The<br/>\nwords used by the OTHER mother were very harsh and judgmental and I&#39;m<br/>\nsure that many of the viewers agreed with them, so just thinking that<br/>\nis intimidating (as much as I too aspire to not worry what &quot;others&quot;<br/>\nthink!) <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I still don&#39;t discuss unschooling much out loud. He<br/>\nknows that I read and post to this list. He knows I am VERY interested<br/>\nand I have said how much I love it. His response while watching this<br/>\nshow was &quot;I don&#39;t like unschooling... I want my kids in school&quot; When I<br/>\nsaid, what if I wasn&#39;t using the word &quot;unschooling&quot; just talking about<br/>\nHOMEschooling, he still said, I don&#39;t like that either. ugh. Very<br/>\ndiscouraging. I asked him why and also said that I didn&#39;t think that<br/>\nhe knew that much about it. He seems to think he gets the idea, that<br/>\nit is obvious.... also, he is very much like this -- once he says he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like something he won&#39;t really expand on it or discuss it more. <br/>\n<br/>\nI still have about 2 1/2 years before we would put our daughter in<br/>\nschool so I am still hopeful. I also ALWAYS keep in mind Sandra&#39;s wise<br/>\nwords -- my family being together and happy is my #1 priority. But I<br/>\nfeel like I WANT unschooling just as much as my husband feels opposed<br/>\nto it -- so I&#39;m not ready to &quot;give up&quot;. I have been thinking of<br/>\ndifferent things -- I may write him a letter since we aren&#39;t so great<br/>\nabout discussing the topic yet. I also would LOVE to go to a<br/>\nconference sometime in the next couple of years (with him of course).<br/>\nIf it comes to school and he still has not changed his mind at all I<br/>\nam ready to accept that, and of course know that nothing is set in<br/>\nstone. It just makes me sad to think that maybe it won&#39;t be for us...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening!

I enjoy reading it. I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m better <br/>\nor more knowledgeable about Shakespeare, but I do enjoy it. And my <br/>\ndaughter has enjoyed it too.

I said it wasn&#39;t true but that people <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t TELL someone else to read Shakespeare, unless they were <br/>\nwilling to risk the person hating Shakespeare (paraphrasing or <br/>\nclarifying myself).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=If a kid showed some interest in Shakespeare I&#39;m gonna pull out <br/>\nmy book with his plays in it. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI pull out the DVDs. I&#39;ve gotten the book to read something that was <br/>\nleft out, or to check people&#39;s names (though the internet is way <br/>\nbetter for that these days, and with google you can find particular <br/>\nlines from plays and get the citation (act/scene/line) , so my books <br/>\nare getting dustier.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did read Henry V before ever seeing or hearing any, and I kinda had <br/>\nthe hots for this reformed, responsible, compassionate former hoodlum <br/>\nof a young king when I was 19 and in college. Mine was way cuter <br/>\nthan Kenneth Brannagh, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can look at music and tell at least vaguely what it would sound <br/>\nlike, but if there&#39;s a piano in the room, I go and put it into the <br/>\nair (at least the melody line). Just last night I played through the <br/>\nleft hand of something in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book. It was by <br/>\nWilliam Byrd and it was called &quot;Bells.&quot; It&#39;s like a church bell- <br/>\npulling team ringing the changes. After four pages I saw it kept <br/>\ngoing but I didn&#39;t turn that other page. I was thinking, though, how <br/>\nfun it must&#39;ve been at one time &quot;to do bell ringing&quot; at home, in the <br/>\n1600s, instead of needing a church and four or six people pulling <br/>\nbig ropes to a script.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there&#39;s a GREAT thing about a book. I can put sound into the air <br/>\nthat was first written down in the 1500s or early 1600s (in that <br/>\ncase). But the book didn&#39;t do it. The composer and collectors and <br/>\ntranscriptionists and engravers and printers and I did that.

I enjoy reading it. I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m better <br/>\nor more knowledgeable about Shakespeare, but I do enjoy it. And my <br/>\ndaughter has enjoyed it too. And reading it lead to all sorts of <br/>\nother wonderful connections and other fun stuff. I think that story <br/>\nis on Sandra&#39;s site, yeah here, http://sandradodd. com/strew/ <br/>\nshakespeare<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-So, really, it can&#39;t be said about everyone. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHey, I did take it back. I said it wasn&#39;t true but that people <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t TELL someone else to read Shakespeare, unless they were <br/>\nwilling to risk the person hating Shakespeare (paraphrasing or <br/>\nclarifying myself).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=If a kid showed some interest in Shakespeare I&#39;m gonna pull out <br/>\nmy book with his plays in it. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI pull out the DVDs. I&#39;ve gotten the book to read something that was <br/>\nleft out, or to check people&#39;s names (though the internet is way <br/>\nbetter for that these days, and with google you can find particular <br/>\nlines from plays and get the citation (act/scene/line) , so my books <br/>\nare getting dustier.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did read Henry V before ever seeing or hearing any, and I kinda had <br/>\nthe hots for this reformed, responsible, compassionate former hoodlum <br/>\nof a young king when I was 19 and in college. Mine was way cuter <br/>\nthan Kenneth Brannagh, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can look at music and tell at least vaguely what it would sound <br/>\nlike, but if there&#39;s a piano in the room, I go and put it into the <br/>\nair (at least the melody line). Just last night I played through the <br/>\nleft hand of something in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book. It was by <br/>\nWilliam Byrd and it was called &quot;Bells.&quot; It&#39;s like a church bell- <br/>\npulling team ringing the changes. After four pages I saw it kept <br/>\ngoing but I didn&#39;t turn that other page. I was thinking, though, how <br/>\nfun it must&#39;ve been at one time &quot;to do bell ringing&quot; at home, in the <br/>\n1600s, instead of needing a church and four or six people pulling <br/>\nbig ropes to a script.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there&#39;s a GREAT thing about a book. I can put sound into the air <br/>\nthat was first written down in the 1500s or early 1600s (in that <br/>\ncase). But the book didn&#39;t do it. The composer and collectors and <br/>\ntranscriptionists and engravers and printers and I did that. (I did <br/>\nthe easy part.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41955,"nextTopicId":41801}}
