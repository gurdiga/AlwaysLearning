I work as<br/>\n&gt;a candymaker sometimes. When I started learning how, I really got &quot;cooking<br/>\n&gt;is chemistry,&quot; because it&#39;s so easy to see how one small error in measuring<br/>\n&gt;can cause big changes or even disasters. Changes in humidity and air<br/>\n&gt;temperature make big differences in your end product too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But if you make brittle you can see the vinegar/baking soda deal and eat it<br/>\n&gt;too. If you mess around with chocolate (real chocolate, not the melting<br/>\n&gt;stuff) you can learn about melting it, dipping, drying it, tempering it,<br/>\n&gt;why it grays, and horrors, what happens if you get a drop of water in it.<br/>\n&gt;If you make fudge by making a sugar syrup you can learn about why it grains<br/>\n&gt;and why it comes out really smooth. If you make marshamallow and divinty<br/>\n&gt;you can learn how to take sugar, water, egg whites, and vanilla and make<br/>\n&gt;two really different things. Marshamallow and divinty are essentially the<br/>\n&gt;same, you just use different proportions, cook the syrups to different<br/>\n&gt;temps, plus  marshmallow has gelatin in it. The whole deal of how you can<br/>\n&gt;cook sugar and water to different temperatures and have really different<br/>\n&gt;things happen is interesting. And how adding air to mixtures changes them<br/>\n&gt;is interesting too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A lot of this stuff you can do at home.  And it usually tastes really good,<br/>\n&gt;even the things that aren&#39;t perfect. The very best candy really is made<br/>\n&gt;with the simplest ingredients, I think.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ann<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nChat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.msn.com\">http://messenger.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269338,"authorName":"Cindy","from":"Cindy &lt;crma@...&gt;","profile":"crma53","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Evangalism","postDate":"1013111537","msgId":4400,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDNjJEQUYxLjIzMzU1N0QxQGl4Lm5ldGNvbS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDIwMjA2LjIyMDcyMi4tMzczOTc5LjUuZnJlZWZvcm1AanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4370,"nextInTopic":4423,"prevInTime":4399,"nextInTime":4401,"topicId":4241,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

One of the weird things about light is that sometimes it acts as if<br/>\nit is made up of tiny particles and sometimes it acts as it if is made up of<br/>\nwaves. For now, we will think of it as acting like waves.  If you have ever<br/>\nwatched waves, this will be much easier.  If you have not, then go take a<br/>\nbath.  While you are getting clean, make waves in the tub and watch<br/>\ncarefully what they do.  You will notice that when a wave hits the side of<br/>\nthe tub, it bounces back.  Light does the same thing, and we call it<br/>\nreflecting.  Part of the light hitting the surface of the bubble goes on<br/>\nthrough and part of it bounces back or reflects back towards you.  Of the<br/>\nlight that goes on into the bubble, more of it is reflected back when it<br/>\nhits the inside surface. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the light that reflects from the outer surface mixes with the light<br/>\nreflecting from the inner surface, something so strange happens that it<br/>\nmight seem like magic.  The light that continued on to reflect from the<br/>\ninner surface had to travel a tiny bit farther (the thickness of the bubble<br/>\nfilm) than the light reflected from the outer surface.  This means that the<br/>\ntwo sets of waves are slightly out of step.  If this difference is just<br/>\nright, some of the waves will cancel each other out and that color will seem<br/>\nto be missing.  Starting with white light, if the difference in the two sets<br/>\nof waves is enough to cancel out the red light, then you would see a<br/>\nblue-green color.  If the color yellow is canceled, you would see blue, and<br/>\nso on. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference in the two sets of waves is controlled by the thickness of<br/>\nthe bubble.  As the water drains from the bubble, the film gets thinner. <br/>\nWhen it is thin enough, the two sets of reflected light reach the right<br/>\nlevel and you begin to see the colors.  Different thicknesses give you<br/>\ndifferent colors.  With a round bubble, the colors seem to swirl, because<br/>\nthe curved surface means you are looking through different thicknesses,<br/>\ndepending on the angle.  When two bubbles are connected they form the flat<br/>\nsurface that we have been looking at.  Since it is a flat surface, the<br/>\nthicknesses are more even and easier to see.  The film is thicker at the<br/>\nbottom and thinner at the top, forming bands of color.  You can even see<br/>\ndifference in this thickness as water flows through the bubble, producing<br/>\nswirls of color.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis same process, called destructive interference, happens other places<br/>\nbesides bubbles.  It is what produces the iridescence seen in insect wings,<br/>\nthe rainbows seen from a film of oil on wet asphalt, and the beautiful<br/>\ncolors of the New Zealand paua shells that I had so much fun collecting last<br/>\nyear. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, this is getting far too long, so I will stop here, but you don&#39;t have<br/>\nto.  With a little research, you can find all sorts of wonders hiding in a<br/>\nsoap bubble.  I hope you all have a safe and happy holiday season. <br/>\n<br/>\n****************************************<br/>\nThis weekly e-mail list is free of charge.  You are welcome to forward it to<br/>\nfriends, print it in your newsletter, repost it on the Internet, etc., as<br/>\nlong as you do not charge for them and my name and e-mail address are<br/>\nincluded. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease forward this e-mail to anyone that you think might enjoy it.  If you<br/>\nreceived this e-mail from someone else and would like to be on the list,<br/>\njust send a blank e-mail to:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:krampf-subscribe@yahoogroups.com\">krampf-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYou will be added to the Experiment of the Week List.  You must send the<br/>\ne-mail from the account where you want to receive the experiments.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach week I will e-mail you a new experiment that you can try yourself.  I<br/>\nlook for experiments that are unusual, safe, dramatic, cheap, and fun. <br/>\nSince this list includes teachers, parents, science buffs, and students, I<br/>\nwill try to give you a wide variety of things to try.<br/>\n<br/>\n***************************<br/>\nRobert Krampf&#39;s on-the-road schedule<br/>\n<br/>\nMy calendar is now on-line.  You can see a detailed calendar, with dates,<br/>\ntimes, schools, etc. at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.krampf.com/mainsubjectsfolder/m_tour.html\">http://www.krampf.com/mainsubjectsfolder/m_tour.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJanuary 14 -

My 10 yo dd likes working with numbers in a structured way.  She likes making lists and graphs and she even likes *playing* flashcards with her ps friends.  My 12 yo dd does not like working with numbers in the same way as 10 yo dd but loves patterns and all kinds of games.  I could either say both of my kids like math or both of my kids don&#39;t like math and I would be correct in each statement.  This is because there are different things about math to like and dislike.  One might enjoy being an auditor the other an engineer, both are math related.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m looking forward to helping my children figure out what they like about things and why.  I love gardening and cooking but I&#39;m not at all interested in the nuts and bolts of either.  I&#39;m more interested in the sensory experience and the creativity.  I&#39;m assuming the key will be in the questions they ask and how other interests they have relate to each other.   Anyone else have observations about their kids that I could add to my mental database?<br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: Jorgen & Ann <br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Wednesday, February 06, 2002 11:35 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: chemistry sets<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Actually all<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;cooking is chemistry. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd one of my favorite kinds of cooking chemistry is candymaking.

There is chemistry<br/>\neverywhere.  Hey!  You could blow up eggs in the<br/>\nmicrowave! I once blew up some in a regular pot on the<br/>\nstove top.  Left them to hardboil and forgot.  When I<br/>\ncame home, the pot was welded to the burner and the<br/>\neggs were eveywhere.  On the textured ceiling, behind<br/>\nthe refrigerator, underneath the uphigh cupboards, one<br/>\nall of the exterior surfaces of everything.
