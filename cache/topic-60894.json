Researching the initial interest often leads to many other related things to explore. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, if you look on Amazon.com for the movie he likes, there will be a short list called &quot;People who bought this also bought that&quot;  and then a long list of &quot;You may also like...&quot;  And in the reviews, people may mention other similar movies while comparing/contrasting that one.  Also try searching for other movies by the same director or writer.  I&#39;m so grateful for Amazon!  I do make purchases there often, but the majority of the time I use it for informational purposes, then see if the movies or books are available at my library. (Or for toys, games, etc., I make a note of the ideas I found online so that I can keep an eye out for some of them when I&#39;m browsing at garage sales or thrift stores or clearance bins.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also like Wikipedia for helping me find more related items or ideas or concepts.  Really, just doing a general online search for info about the specific movie your son likes is bound to lead to something else which leads to something else... :)<br/>\n<br/>\nmaryann<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;aldq75&quot; &lt;aldq75@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One of my girls likes the Nancy Drew computer games.
