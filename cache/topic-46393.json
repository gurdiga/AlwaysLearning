Over the years, though, the school had become more traditional in it&#39;s approach.  So the physical space really didn&#39;t work--imagine trying to run 4 structured classes in a large room with partitions.  The noise level was very high, children were constantly &quot;sneaking&quot; around, under, and above barriers to wave to their friends, etc. etc.  I thought it was pretty humorous..actually... and had a lot of fun in that placement...every day was like herding cats--and the cats had been given quite an advantage!  I met some pretty interesting characters with a lot of unappreciated creativity and ingenuity.

I was glad <br/>\n  to find a Wikipedia page, but amused at this:<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-Open-space schools continue to be a very controversial idea for the <br/>\n  obvious reason that a lack of architectural walls increases the noise <br/>\n  and distraction making the teaching environment non-conducive to <br/>\n  learning.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  When people talked about &quot;School without walls&quot; they weren&#39;t talking <br/>\n  about INSIDE walls--they were talking about acknowledging that <br/>\n  learning happens inside and outside, and that kids shouldn&#39;t be locked <br/>\n  up by age in rows, nor should they be limited to learning from just <br/>\n  the teachers at their school. &quot;School without walls&quot; had to do with <br/>\n  seeing &quot;school&quot; not as the building, but as the experience of learning <br/>\n  in different, more flexible, more creative ways.<br/>\n<br/>\n  When schools were built with open floor plans, the idea was that kids <br/>\n  could go from the library to the science center to the reading place <br/>\n  to the math games when and as they wanted to, and that there would be <br/>\n  teachers in those areas to help the kids who came there. So the <br/>\n  teachers would be with the subjects rather than with the kids.
