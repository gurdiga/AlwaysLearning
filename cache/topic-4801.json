There are Mexican restaurants in other parts of the<br/>\n&gt; country<br/>\n&gt; (California, I know) that use them as dessert, with powdered sugar on<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; outside.

Tilt it so the honey&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; distributed<br/>\n&gt; around inside.  Eat the bread with the meal (biting off, not tearing<br/>\n&gt; off) to<br/>\n&gt; keep the chile-heat from burning your mouth too much.

I love sopapillas.  Never had the New Mexican authentic<br/>\nversion, but have had the midwest interpretation (i.e. - poor excuse for<br/>\nwhat a true sopapilla sounds like).  There is a family owned mexican<br/>\nrestaurant near us that serves the best midwest sopapillas.  They deep<br/>\nfry(not to crispy) a large flour tortilla, sprinkle on sugar and cinnamon,<br/>\nslather it with honey and will put Redi Whip on top if desired.  Some of the<br/>\nother mexican joints serve the little triangle ones, but they are so crispy<br/>\nyou could crack a tooth.  Sopapillas are always desserts here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI need to make a food road trip.  The food here in michigan is, well -<br/>\nstinky.  I find it hard to find really good food in affordable restaurants.<br/>\nEverything is meat and potatoes - crappy gravy(not the real stuff, just the<br/>\nbeef or chicken base blech).  I love really good food, but usually that is<br/>\nsomething homemade or super expensive at a fancy chic chic pooh pooh place<br/>\nthat I can only afford once a year(at the most).  Sometimes the real<br/>\nexpensive stuff tastes like crap too.  The family restaurant I work at now<br/>\nserves mostly swill(canned, fake or just crappy), except for a couple of<br/>\nitems.  When I worked at the country club, I became a food snob, because our<br/>\nchef took such pride in his work( and made the most fantastic food, soups,<br/>\nreal gravies, sauces, etc).  Now, if I want something good, I search the web<br/>\nfor recipes, watch PBS or FoodTV shows or ask my sister to cook.<br/>\n<br/>\nsistakammi - hungry<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, February 16, 2002 9:40 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] I&#39;m off!: sopapilla<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 2/16/02 7:12:45 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bearspawprint@...\">bearspawprint@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; What is a sopapilla?   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a good description from someone&#39;s travel diary online, someone biking<br/>\nin southern Utah/Colorado (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mikebentley.com/bike/harry/19-21.htm)\">http://www.mikebentley.com/bike/harry/19-21.htm)</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA sopapilla (so-pah-PEE-yah) is a type of bread served in most<br/>\nMexican restaurants in the New Mexico area.

The sopaipilla is thought to have originated in Albuquerque, New <br/>\nMexico, more than 200 years ago. It&#39;s a favorite Southwestern U.S. dessert, <br/>\nusually served with honey or syrup flavored with anise or cinnamon. <br/>\nSopaipillas are also sometimes filled with savory ingredients like REFRIED <br/>\nBEANS.  <br/>\n------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nI need to say a couple of things about that definition I found online &lt;g&gt;:  <br/>\nThey are NOT &quot;usually served with...&quot; anything except honey except outside <br/>\nNew Mexico.  There are Mexican restaurants in other parts of the country  <br/>\n(California, I know) that use them as dessert, with powdered sugar on the <br/>\noutside.  And &quot;crisp&quot; is not good. Crisp is overcooked.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re New Mexican, not &quot;Mexican,&quot; and while it&#39;s true that leftovers (when <br/>\nthey&#39;re cold) can be filled with beans for kids to eat, and there&#39;s a dish <br/>\ncalled &quot;stuffed sopaipilla&quot; but that&#39;s covered with sauce and eaten with a <br/>\nfork, the proper use in a New Mexican restaurant is this:<br/>\n<br/>\nTear off a corner, and pour just a little honey inside--about a teaspoon or <br/>\ntwo, depending on the size of the bread.  Tilt it so the honey&#39;s distributed <br/>\naround inside.  Eat the bread with the meal (biting off, not tearing off) to <br/>\nkeep the chile-heat from burning your mouth too much.  The bread and honey <br/>\nwill cut the burn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had two last  night. &lt;g&gt;  Elissa and Joe are great people and talkative, <br/>\nand we had a good time, but they were exhausted from being awake so long, and <br/>\nthey missed the tour from car rental taking a long time.  That was pretty <br/>\ngood, because the tour was terrible.  We&#39;d hoped they could meet Dave and <br/>\nNancy Martinez (who are quietly on this list, and not so quietly active at <br/>\nunschooling.com, but there were two near-meetings and none successful.  The <br/>\nhomeschoolers were swimming on the West Mesa last night, at a pool with <br/>\nslides and kid-stuff, and Holly was with them, and Dave and Nancy stayed <br/>\nuntil the little kids were through having fun. And Joe and Elissa stayed here <br/>\n(WAY across the valley, by the mountains) until they were too sleepy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":69247285,"authorName":"Sharon Rudd","from":"Sharon Rudd &lt;bearspawprint@...&gt;","profile":"bearspawprint","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] I&#39;m off!: sopapilla","postDate":"1013868601","msgId":4872,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwMjE2MTQxMDAxLjQxNTQzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0MzAxLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNDNkUwRUFGLjczQTNCRTJGQGd0ZS5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":4870,"nextInTopic":4873,"prevInTime":4871,"nextInTime":4873,"topicId":4801,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"What is a sopapilla?
