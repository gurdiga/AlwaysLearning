So I don&#39;t want to encourage people to come here and ask about what shoes to buy or mini-vans, or juice boxes.  Unschoolers might use them, but it&#39;s not about unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are good for twelve year olds or for teens or adults or younger children.  They&#39;re clear, plain logic, and they&#39;re also all beautiful and multi-layered.  (Flow Free is not so layered, but is especially beautiful.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nplants vs. zombies at $6.99 is the most expensive thing I&#39;ve bought for iPad,<br/>\nand it was worth much more.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the games we play here lately have free versions and then some paid at<br/>\n$1.99 or 99Â¢, and that is less than a greeting card, and Keith, Marty and I have<br/>\nplayed them for MANY hours. Those games would be easy enough for a four year<br/>\nold with spatial skills, or to play as a two-player game (take turns, and let<br/>\nhim have the easy plays):<br/>\n<br/>\nFlow Free (there are add-on levels for a dollar or two)<br/>\n<br/>\nFlip Pix Art  (some are free; there are about ten of them altogether, I think)<br/>\n             After Joyce&#39;s husband saw this game, he took it to work and the other professors were playing it, too. <br/>\n             My engineer husband plays it nearly every night, and has been doing HexLogic some too, but Flip Pix is his favorite.<br/>\n             Julie Daniel is really good at it, as is my son Marty.  Marty has played them all and said only once did he have to guess something; there&#39;s always a clue.<br/>\n\t     There are easier levels, and harder ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nFlip Pix Jigsaw (there are several of these, none expensive)<br/>\n<br/>\nHexLogic (there are four, and probably will be five with a few weeks if there aren&#39;t already)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re all by Gabysoft except for Flow Free which is by Big Duck games. It<br/>\nmight help to put the maker in when you search.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry googling logic games for iPad, though.  Youll get images and reviews.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":216757719,"authorName":"Blissland1234","from":"Blissland1234 &lt;blissland1234@...&gt;","profile":"blissland1234","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Ipad apps for 12 year old","postDate":"1355388142","msgId":69793,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZDOTJGNUU3LTFGMUMtNDBGRS04Njk4LUQ4REE2MjdCOTgyREB5YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":69795,"prevInTime":69792,"nextInTime":69794,"topicId":69793,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Since we ve been talking about ipad apps, can anyone recommend some cheap, good, challenging strategy games for my 12 year old daughter?
