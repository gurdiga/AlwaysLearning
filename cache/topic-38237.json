I saw<br/>\nthe dogs at the last second as we came around a corner.  They were in a yard<br/>\nwhere there are not usually dogs. (the lady&#39;s dd was visiting from out of<br/>\ntown with 2 dogs and no collars on)  I tried to size up their body language<br/>\nas they ran over and at the same time I was getting ready to ask the owner<br/>\nwho was standing there if the dogs were friendly, and before I had time to<br/>\neven think, the dog was on our puppy,  growling, snarling, and biting.   It<br/>\ndidn&#39;t break the skin so it was more likely a show of dominance but it was<br/>\nreally scary and for a couple minutes after the attack our puppy sat in the<br/>\nroad whimpering.  I dragged the dog off  our puppy by the scruff of the neck<br/>\nand back skin as the owner wasn&#39;t reacting very quickly.  I held onto him<br/>\nuntil she took him from me and after that I started carrying a big stick.<br/>\n(although I&#39;ve gotten lazy about that lately since those dogs are gone and<br/>\nour route is familiar)<br/>\n<br/>\nThankfully, the puppy got over his fright pretty quickly and we moved on but<br/>\nit was scary for me and I know it was scary for my dd too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur pup is delightful!  He gets walked every day and he has a million toys<br/>\nto play with so he&#39;s good about not eating stuff he shouldn&#39;t.  (Although he<br/>\ndid snag a loaf of bread off the counter last night for the first time!)  He<br/>\nloves to be outside and if he&#39;s starts to get mischievous, all one of us has<br/>\nto do (if we don&#39;t feel like playing ball or something) is to sit on the<br/>\nfront porch while he entertains himself outside.

I ve known the dad of that","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1375837976\">I was having a dog conversation just yesterday with Holly&#39;s  <br/>\nboyfriend.   Holly  housesat for friends of ours who have four dogs.   <br/>\nI&#39;ve known the dad of that family since he in his late teens.  (The  <br/>\nmom since her mid-teens, come to think of it, but I knew them  <br/>\nseparately and they weren&#39;t even in the same town.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve known every dog he ever had, though I don&#39;t know the current  <br/>\nones as well as I knew earlier ones.  What I DO know is that the dogs  <br/>\nare crazed, untrained, desperate for attention and destructive.  And  <br/>\nthey have a new dog who&#39;s chewing things up--books, dishes...   So  <br/>\nHolly needed to stay there 24 hours a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer boyfriend was there with her a lot of the time, which made me  <br/>\nfeel better about her being in a big house with the owners clearly  <br/>\ngone.   But he was talking about how the dogs are.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy contrast, our dog is mellow and will guard the front door, but if  <br/>\nwe tell her someone&#39;s fine, she calms down.  Occasionally she&#39;ll nip  <br/>\nat the heels of a male visitor if he&#39;s walking fast or she&#39;d rather  <br/>\nhe&#39;d leave, but she&#39;s never bitten for real.  Our cats adore her and  <br/>\none is usually lying touching her if she&#39;s lying down.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe our dog is a genius and understands English.  I don&#39;t think  <br/>\nso.  Marty dropped out of puppy training because he didn&#39;t like their  <br/>\nrough methods.  We&#39;ve just treated the dog gently and sweetly and let  <br/>\nher know what wasn&#39;t okay to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur next door neighbors never say anything decent to their dogs.   <br/>\nThey yell at them all the time, so the dogs bark at other people all  <br/>\nthe time, and then the people yell at them more and the dogs bark more.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the house where Holly was, the dogs have medications, and have to  <br/>\nbe fed separately and given pills and the food is measured.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has housesat other dogs.  The less food she&#39;s instructed to give  <br/>\nthem, the worse the dogs behave.  Those who have more food are  <br/>\ncalmer.  Our dog, calmest of them all, has all the dogfood and  <br/>\ncatfood she wants.  But she&#39;s not fat.  The vet expressed nearly  <br/>\ndisbelief that she was given all the food she wants.    There&#39;s  <br/>\nalways food down, and she doesn&#39;t eat it unless she&#39;s hungry.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of that has to do with unschooling.  There are aspects of all of  <br/>\nthose things that can illuminate principles behind unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a dog needs to chew, they need MORE things to chew, not fewer  <br/>\nthings.  Say yes to the dog, give him stuff to chew, and then let him  <br/>\nknow gently what&#39;s not okay to chew, and keep the best stuff up until  <br/>\nhe&#39;s older.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose dogs and their medications?  Holly doesn&#39;t see anything wrong  <br/>\nwith the dogs, but sure enough, three of them need medications.   <br/>\nWhy?  She doesn&#39;t know.  But the kids in that family need medications  <br/>\ntoo, and the mom is on an ever-more-limited diet.  No doubt stress is  <br/>\na factor.  Deprivation can&#39;t be helping.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout dog care, Marty helped me see that our dog has specialized  <br/>\nexpectations.  If the dog wants new or different food, she comes to  <br/>\nme.  She hangs around when I&#39;m cooking.  She has a very food-specific  <br/>\nexpectant posture she takes with me, though she&#39;s good-natured if I  <br/>\ntell her to go on.  She leave the room on &quot;Go on, Gudrun,&quot; and I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t say it meanly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt turns out she doesn&#39;t beg from the others (though it&#39;s not much  <br/>\n&quot;begging&quot; anyway; it&#39;s subtle).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she wants to play, she goes to Marty.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it&#39;s nearly sundown, she starts hanging around Keith in the  <br/>\n&quot;going for a walk&quot; positions--near the back door, or near wherever he  <br/>\nis and she looks at the door and jumps up if she thinks he&#39;s not  <br/>\nunderstanding plain dog language.  She never does the go-for-a-walk  <br/>\nstuff with me, even though I do take her sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] what my dogs doing","postDate":"1221487416","msgId":38339,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgwOTE1MDcwM3Q3ZjYzNWEwOW9mMzc1ZDI3NDlmNmYzYzRjQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwQjhFODlBLTQxM0QtNDhCOC05ODg2LTA4OTY3NDBEOTNBMUBjb3gubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDdDNDUxRDcyLTQ0MTItNDczMC04Q0VFLTIyNkM3N0YzQUExQ0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JIDxGMjc4NEZBNjc2OTc0NzkxQTdENkU4RDg5NzY3OUUyOEBFYm9ueT4JIDwzYTkzZmZmMTA4MDkxNTAzNTlsNDhlMWJlYmZ4MjVkZjczY2UzNjAxY2ZiYUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JIDwyMEI4RTg5QS00MTNELTQ4QjgtOTg4Ni0wODk2NzQwRDkzQTFAY294Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":38338,"nextInTopic":38346,"prevInTime":38338,"nextInTime":38340,"topicId":38237,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oh!

Or numerous don&#39;t?<br/>\n<br/>\n I think everyone feels supported and respected in this family. And from<br/>\nthat<br/>\nplace, they take good care of the dogs most of the time. There is no<br/>\nschedule, no duty that has to be done by a particular person at a particular<br/>\ntime (though if they wanted to do it that way for predictability reasons,<br/>\nthat would be fine too). I&#39;m the one to make sure the jobs are done everyday<br/>\nby someone.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone in my family also feels supported and respected and in return they<br/>\ngenerally respond in a like manner.  My kids aren&#39;t that little anymore and<br/>\nthey&#39;ve always been unschooled without the forced chores or random rules.<br/>\nThey are almost 12 & 14.  They are used to taking care of their animals<br/>\nbecause we&#39;ve had horses for 4 years and cats and rabbits (off and on) for<br/>\nas long as they can remember and they&#39;ve always participated in their care<br/>\nbecause they enjoy it. (notice I said participated in, not took full<br/>\nresponsibility) They understood when we got the dog what kind of work it<br/>\nentailed because they already shared in some big responsibilities with our<br/>\nother animals.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I also knew that they were still kids and that they are often busy<br/>\nand I knew the brunt of the responsibility would fall on me and I am willing<br/>\nto do that because I really wanted a dog.  I didn&#39;t get the dog with the<br/>\nimpression that the kids had the whole responsibility to care for him and<br/>\nthey knew that.  They knew it would be a family thing and not once yet, (3.5<br/>\nmonths) have they not gotten up from whatever they were doing and taken the<br/>\ndog outside when I&#39;ve asked.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving a dog inspires me to walk every day and sometimes one or both come<br/>\nwith me and often I walk him alone.  It&#39;s something I enjoy and I knew that<br/>\nI would enjoy that going into it.  Occasionally the girls walk him alone but<br/>\nless often since he was attacked by a dog.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, like you, there aren&#39;t certain responsibilities that they must do but<br/>\nbecause they feel supported and respected and they did agree to help with<br/>\nthe work it takes to have a dog, they do it with a good attitude.  They love<br/>\nhim!<br/>\n<br/>\nI also enjoy mucking the horse&#39;s stalls and I do that most of the time while<br/>\nLeigh my cat lover feeds the cats because she likes to.  Both girls take<br/>\ncare of the rabbits although my younger dd needs more reminding than my<br/>\nolder.  Both girls share in all the horse responsibilities but I muck much<br/>\nmore often than they do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] what my dogs doing","postDate":"1221476347","msgId":38331,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgwOTE1MDM1OWw0OGUxYmViZngyNWRmNzNjZTM2MDFjZmJhQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEYyNzg0RkE2NzY5NzQ3OTFBN0Q2RThEODk3Njc5RTI4QEVib255Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDdDNDUxRDcyLTQ0MTItNDczMC04Q0VFLTIyNkM3N0YzQUExQ0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JIDxGMjc4NEZBNjc2OTc0NzkxQTdENkU4RDg5NzY3OUUyOEBFYm9ueT4="},"prevInTopic":38323,"nextInTopic":38336,"prevInTime":38330,"nextInTime":38332,"topicId":38237,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I just love whisperer stuff and your post has me wishing severely that we have cable so I could watch it regularly.

I was against getting a dog until the whole family was committed<br/>\n&gt; because you are dealing with an animal&#39;s life and there are so many dogs<br/>\n&gt; that are neglected because it was more work than a family expected. I still<br/>\n&gt; stand by all that I said about it being a family decision because it&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; huge decision that affects the whole family and ultimately a dog&#39;s life.<br/>\n&gt; Anyway.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It was shortly after that post that my husband decided that he was once<br/>\n&gt; again ready to have a dog in the family. I had been ready for a while but I<br/>\n&gt; needed it to be a family decision. It had been 9 years since we had had a<br/>\n&gt; dog. We now have a lovely puppy named Archie. We got him June 1st. He is<br/>\n&gt; a black lab and he is a LOT of work but we all pitch together to care for<br/>\n&gt; him and because everyone agreed and was willing and everyone loves him, he<br/>\n&gt; gets all the care he deserves. I walk him every morning. The kids walk him<br/>\n&gt; periodically. The kids or I play ball with him whenever he gets wound up.<br/>\n&gt; And we all enjoy his snuggles and loving. My husband enjoys him too and he<br/>\n&gt; will feel safer leaving us home alone when he travels for work (which he<br/>\n&gt; does a lot) as soon as he is fully grown. (And my don&#39;t they grown fast!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am so glad we said yes but I am also very glad we waited until it was the<br/>\n&gt; right time for our family. We have 2 horses, 2 rabbits, 2 cats, and now a<br/>\n&gt; dog. I love all of our animals but there is just something special about a<br/>\n&gt; dog because they want to be with you so much. We are his pack. :-) We are<br/>\n&gt; avid Dog Whisperer watchers and we have learned so much about dog<br/>\n&gt; psychology<br/>\n&gt; that we didn&#39;t know back when we had our last dog.

I still<br/>\nstand by all that I said about it being a family decision because it&#39;s a<br/>\nhuge decision that affects the whole family and ultimately a dog&#39;s life.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJust wondering...what happens if one of the children doesn&#39;t do anything to<br/>\ntake care of the dog? Or numerous don&#39;t?<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember your original post about this issue months ago, and as I recall,<br/>\nyou wanted agreement that everyone would help. If you are still standing by<br/>\nthe idea that everyone has to agree to partake in the care taking, I&#39;m<br/>\nreally interested in what happens if it plays out that they don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I take care of our dogs for days at a time...feeding, watering,<br/>\netc., and my kids are all older teenagers. Someone always takes care of the<br/>\ndogs, and it is usually one of the kids, but they are very involved in<br/>\noutside things in general right now, and there are times when they aren&#39;t<br/>\nhere much. And sometimes they are here and beat, or catching up with a show,<br/>\nor some such thing. Since I&#39;m not trying to catch up on a show, or beat, I<br/>\nhappily take care of it. I don&#39;t say, &quot;It&#39;s your turn&quot;...in fact, I can&#39;t<br/>\never remember saying that. I may say, &quot;Would you please feed the dogs?&quot; if<br/>\nI&#39;ve got something else going on. And most every time the reply will be yes.<br/>\nBut if it wasn&#39;t, I would ask someone else, feed them later, or just do it<br/>\nthen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think everyone feels supported and respected in this family. And from that<br/>\nplace, they take good care of the dogs most of the time. There is no<br/>\nschedule, no duty that has to be done by a particular person at a particular<br/>\ntime (though if they wanted to do it that way for predictability reasons,<br/>\nthat would be fine too). I&#39;m the one to make sure the jobs are done everyday<br/>\nby someone.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I am mis-remembering the post of months ago, my apologies. It&#39;s still a<br/>\ngreat subject though!<br/>\n<br/>\nJacki</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":321729783,"authorName":"Angela Shaw","from":"&quot;Angela Shaw&quot; &lt;game-enthusiast@...&gt;","profile":"autonomousangela","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"what my dogs doing","postDate":"1221443118","msgId":38314,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYyNzg0RkE2NzY5NzQ3OTFBN0Q2RThEODk3Njc5RTI4QEVib255Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDdDNDUxRDcyLTQ0MTItNDczMC04Q0VFLTIyNkM3N0YzQUExQ0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":38237,"nextInTopic":38323,"prevInTime":38313,"nextInTime":38315,"topicId":38237,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Speaking of dogs.
