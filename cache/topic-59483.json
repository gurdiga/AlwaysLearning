It&#39;s his shtick, the idea that the adolescent brain is <br/>\nan immature brain that isn&#39;t really making appropriate decisions. I&#39;m guessing <br/>\nthat the kind of coalition forming that these researchers are finding is <br/>\nabsolutely important for an adolescent. And I think Joyce is right, it&#39;s really <br/>\nimportant for a school kid, these are a kind of family who can cut you out of <br/>\nthe will at any moment. They are absolutely essential for your social standing. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe the teenagers&#39; friends were closer friends than the other folks&#39; friends? <br/>\nMaybe they do more together and so it was more exciting just the idea that they <br/>\nwere watching?

I love the idea that the thrill of hanging <br/>\nout with your friends is being looked at and written up in the same kind of way <br/>\nthat addiction is looked at: the reward pathways of the brain light up more. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a lot of stuff is about making people feel better. If you can <br/>\ndemonstrate that children, good children, go astray because their brains are <br/>\nimmature than you can feel justified in lots and lots of decisions that limit <br/>\ntheir access to whatever it is that their immature brains can&#39;t handle. By <br/>\nmaking it biological folks can figure that their isn&#39;t anything environmental at <br/>\nplay. Usually that&#39;s wrong. Usually biology and environment work in tandem.
