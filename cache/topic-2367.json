I think that kids get over <br/>\nthings faster than adults because they are in perpetual motion. <br/>\nAdults on the other hand live with the fallacy that life is always <br/>\nthe same and hence &quot;pain&quot;, &quot;suffering&quot;, &quot;trauma&quot; is something that <br/>\nyou will live with for the rest of your life. Kids do not have a <br/>\n&quot;rest of your life&quot; concept of time, they live in the moment and for <br/>\nthat reason deschooling is easy on them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the parents, it is a whole other thing. If a child resists <br/>\nlessons, teaching of just a parents &quot;good advice&quot; it is not out of <br/>\nspite. This is their way of saying &quot;YOU JUST DON&#39;T GET IT&quot;. Fights <br/>\nare not about violence, they are about broken communication. So if a <br/>\nchild is hostile to a parent&#39;s style of homeschooling, they are not <br/>\nasking to go back to school. What they are telling the parents is <br/>\nthat THEY KNOW WHAT IS BEST FOR THEM. When it comes to homeschooling, <br/>\nresistance comes out of the kids knowing clearly what they want but <br/>\nfeeling frustrated the &#39;rents have not caught up with that insight.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;homeschooling hostilities&quot; are all about changing the paradigm <br/>\nof learning. It is going from the paradigm of &quot;school&quot; to the <br/>\nparadigm of &quot;education&quot; to the paradigm of &quot;learning&quot;. They are very <br/>\ndifferent ideologies and practices. For this reason, if you need to <br/>\nfill out portfolios or what not, learn how to do so effectively with <br/>\nwhat you have and are doing right now because in this first year you <br/>\nshould really do no &quot;schooling&quot; at all. Really. People should take <br/>\nthe first year of homeschooling as a present to themselves and just <br/>\nnot do anything but explore what this new way of life means to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, after that year, you can offer them a cookie as well ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nLiza<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Are there ways that your insights about deschooling can be applied to<br/>\n&gt;how I help new homeschoolers deschool?

Lately it&#39;s been insects and doesn&#39;t that<br/>\nsound academic?  Also lately he likes to color fuzzy velvet posters.<br/>\n(No<br/>\nElvis so far) but fuzzy velvet posters don&#39;t sound nearly as academic as<br/>\ninsects.  And always it is cartoons and Godzilla and X-files, and<br/>\nM*A*S*H, and Playstation and Gameboy and Calvin and Hobbs and Peanuts.  <br/>\nMy point is that we tend to see certain things as learning and other<br/>\nthings strictly as entertainment.  But I can tell you he&#39;s learned more<br/>\nuseful things from all that entertainment than he has from being able to<br/>\ntell a bee assassin from a milkweed beetle.  That&#39;s cool and impresses<br/>\nbig people but what he really uses every day is his sense of drama, and<br/>\nhumor and compassion and  his quick thinking and dexterity and his<br/>\nobservation skills.  He has an astounding visual memory which helps him<br/>\nall the time.  <br/>\nDylan couldn&#39;t sit down and do the multiplication tables like a third<br/>\ngrader here could do but he can count the money in his wallet and<br/>\ndetermine if there is enough for the things he wants to buy.  He can<br/>\nfigure how much he&#39;ll have left, how much change he&#39;ll get back, how<br/>\nmuch<br/>\nhe needs to save for the next thing.  He plays cribbage with his dad and<br/>\ncan count by 15&#39;s like nobody business.  He can add his score in Yahtzee<br/>\nand that&#39;s because he likes to play.  He&#39;s awsome at SET.  So is he<br/>\nbehind?  Maybe according to the school but not according to his life. <br/>\nWhat he needs in his real life right now he knows or will know as the<br/>\nneed arises because he gets to live and use what he learns.  He has<br/>\nnever<br/>\nencountered a situation in ten years of life that required knowing the<br/>\nmultiplication tables.    <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy does Nate need to read right now Lisa?  He&#39;s not driving around in<br/>\nyour car, he&#39;s not going to work, he&#39;s not walking around town by<br/>\nhimself.   What does he absolutely NEED to read right now that you can&#39;t<br/>\nhelp him with?  <br/>\nThe only reason kids are forced into reading so early at school is for<br/>\nthe convenience of the teachers.   No little kid needs to read at six or<br/>\nseven or eight or even 10 or 12.   Maybe by the time he wants a job, or<br/>\nwants his drivers licence but how far away is that?  In between there is<br/>\nso much time to hear wonderful stories and see great movies and play. <br/>\n(And in fact, my husband works with a man who has his high school<br/>\ndiploma and never learned to read.  He makes an excellent living as an<br/>\nequipment operator, he&#39;s better paid than our Mayor,  has a nice home a<br/>\nlovely wife and a loyal dog.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you start to look at what Nate likes to play as meaningful to his<br/>\nlife<br/>\nright now you will begin to see a world of learning in it.  He doesn&#39;t<br/>\nneed to be measured or judged against someone else&#39;s standard, he just<br/>\nneeds to be a kid and play and have you involved with him.  Just read to<br/>\nhim when he wants, play with him, take him places he likes to go, tell<br/>\nhim what a cool kid he is and how much you like to be with him.

What if Nate just played and healed and found joy in his life<br/>\neveryday and knew you were proud of him no matter what?  Would you trade<br/>\nthat for reading right now?

This month&#39;s HOME EDUCATION <br/>\nMAGAZINE has two articles on deschooling: Sandra Dodd&#39;s DESCHOOLING <br/>\nFOR PARENTS and my article TAKING THE SCHOOL OUT OF HOMESCHOOL. I do <br/>\nnot know if it was fate or a coincidence arranged by the editor :-) <br/>\nbut the main argument in both of our articles is simply this:<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has been argued for many years that children need to decompress or <br/>\ndeschool after being removed from school in order to clear the path <br/>\nto homeschooling or unschooling. Well, children don&#39;t homeschool or <br/>\nunschool in a vacuum; they do so after all with their parents. <br/>\nParents need to deschool as much as, if not even more than, their <br/>\nchildren since most have many more years of schooling than their <br/>\nbrood.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sent out a questionnaire to about 7 homeschooling and unschooling <br/>\nemail lists. The response about this topic was overwhelming (I wish I <br/>\nhad been able to include most of my respondents quotes). From their <br/>\nwisdom I got what I call the &quot;The Three Rs&quot; or stages of deschooling:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;RESISTANCE is the stage in which children or parents are opposed to <br/>\n&gt;the idea of homeschooling or any learning at all, not because they <br/>\n&gt;want to go back to school but because homeschooling is too much like <br/>\n&gt;school.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>REGROUPING is about backing off and backing down from expectations <br/>\nand judgements. It is a time to play, to hang out and to reassess <br/>\npriorities. This is the decompression period a lot of homeschoolers <br/>\ntalk about and which many homeschoolers believe should be one month <br/>\nfor every year our kids attended school.<br/>\n<br/>\nRESEARCH comes along with resistance and regrouping: This is the time <br/>\nspent immersed in the homeschooling community, meeting and learning <br/>\nmore about the different styles and experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis last stage I like to think also about it as a time for <br/>\nREDISCOVERY in the sense that, through learning more about all the <br/>\noptions available in homeschooling, both parents and children can <br/>\nfind new ways of doing what they had thought they could not do or <br/>\nwere not allowed to do because it was not schooling. So, in a sense, <br/>\nby learning about the different ways one can learn through <br/>\nhomeschooling, hopefully children and parents alike can find the joy <br/>\nthey lost at school for learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe article came after an AHA! moment I had on an email discussion. <br/>\nIf you take into consideration that my parents sent me to school at <br/>\nthe age of three and that I had not stopped being in a school setting <br/>\nuntil I quit teaching college and decided not to write a <br/>\ndissertation; then that would have made me a SCHOOLER for 27 <br/>\nCONSECUTIVE YEARS.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the issue of DESCHOOLING became very clear to me. My son (who is <br/>\nstill not of compulsory age) attended nursery schools and pre-k for 2 <br/>\nyears (he just turned 5). He is an incredibly social child so it took <br/>\nhim about 6 months to get over the fact that his friends were in <br/>\nschool and he was not. I, on the other hand, am still getting the <br/>\nhang of NOT doing school.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour son is just 8 years old. I cannot find the links (will post them <br/>\nlater) of some of the child development researchers who believe they <br/>\ncan change schools by actually having them throw away academic work <br/>\n----or stave it until kids reach the age of 11 or 12. Your son needs <br/>\nto play and just be and right now you are still trying to cram things <br/>\ndown his throat by being worried about his &quot;academic&quot; future.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about it. isn&#39;t it weird for us to worry about this? Academic <br/>\nwork is what you do when working in a university and writing a <br/>\nthesis. What your son and all children should be doing at the age of <br/>\n8 is playing, growing and being because that is the way that most <br/>\nmammals, including humans, learn. All this academic poppycock is <br/>\nactually stunting children&#39;s, and in the end human, development. <br/>\nSorry about the rant but I get really passionate about this.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou said you did some field trips. I say, do some more. You and your <br/>\nguy need to go on some adventures, get away from it all, and <br/>\nreconnect as mother and child, as Lisa and Nate, and not as teacher <br/>\nand student or &quot;assessor&quot; and &quot;academic achievement grade&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeschooling is going to be a bumpy ride but y&#39;all be fine. You just <br/>\nneed to find the fun in learning and forget about the &#39;academic work&#39; <br/>\n--and when I say you I mean, YOU. Your son said already what he wants <br/>\nand how he wants it. Lisa needs to reassess how she wants to help <br/>\nNate accomplish that. I would start with some chamomile tea and a <br/>\nbubble bath. Oh, and I rented a whole slew of AbFab and Monty Python <br/>\ntapes  --nothing like good ol&#39; brit humor and silliness to put things <br/>\ninto perspective. Then, do things together. Find things the both of <br/>\nyou LOVE, not just like but LOVE doing together. Then, hang out some <br/>\nmore.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust remember to have fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nLiza<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

This month s HOME EDUCATION MAGAZINE","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-511888074\">Hi Lisa and all,<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been lurking on this list for months now but the coincidence <br/>\nof your subject is too big to pass. This month&#39;s HOME EDUCATION <br/>\nMAGAZINE has two articles on deschooling: Sandra Dodd&#39;s DESCHOOLING <br/>\nFOR PARENTS and my article TAKING THE SCHOOL OUT OF HOMESCHOOL. I do <br/>\nnot know if it was fate or a coincidence arranged by the editor :-) <br/>\nbut the main argument in both of our articles is simply this:<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has been argued for many years that children need to decompress or <br/>\ndeschool after being removed from school in order to clear the path <br/>\nto homeschooling or unschooling. Well, children don&#39;t homeschool or <br/>\nunschool in a vacuum; they do so after all with their parents. <br/>\nParents need to deschool as much as, if not even more than, their <br/>\nchildren since most have many more years of schooling than their <br/>\nbrood.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sent out a questionnaire to about 7 homeschooling and unschooling <br/>\nemail lists. The response about this topic was overwhelming (I wish I <br/>\nhad been able to include most of my respondents quotes). From their <br/>\nwisdom I got what I call the &quot;The Three Rs&quot; or stages of deschooling:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;RESISTANCE is the stage in which children or parents are opposed to <br/>\n&gt;the idea of homeschooling or any learning at all, not because they <br/>\n&gt;want to go back to school but because homeschooling is too much like <br/>\n&gt;school.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>REGROUPING is about backing off and backing down from expectations <br/>\nand judgements. It is a time to play, to hang out and to reassess <br/>\npriorities. This is the decompression period a lot of homeschoolers <br/>\ntalk about and which many homeschoolers believe should be one month <br/>\nfor every year our kids attended school.<br/>\n<br/>\nRESEARCH comes along with resistance and regrouping: This is the time <br/>\nspent immersed in the homeschooling community, meeting and learning <br/>\nmore about the different styles and experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis last stage I like to think also about it as a time for <br/>\nREDISCOVERY in the sense that, through learning more about all the <br/>\noptions available in homeschooling, both parents and children can <br/>\nfind new ways of doing what they had thought they could not do or <br/>\nwere not allowed to do because it was not schooling. So, in a sense, <br/>\nby learning about the different ways one can learn through <br/>\nhomeschooling, hopefully children and parents alike can find the joy <br/>\nthey lost at school for learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe article came after an AHA! moment I had on an email discussion. <br/>\nIf you take into consideration that my parents sent me to school at <br/>\nthe age of three and that I had not stopped being in a school setting <br/>\nuntil I quit teaching college and decided not to write a <br/>\ndissertation; then that would have made me a SCHOOLER for 27 <br/>\nCONSECUTIVE YEARS.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the issue of DESCHOOLING became very clear to me. My son (who is <br/>\nstill not of compulsory age) attended nursery schools and pre-k for 2 <br/>\nyears (he just turned 5). He is an incredibly social child so it took <br/>\nhim about 6 months to get over the fact that his friends were in <br/>\nschool and he was not. I, on the other hand, am still getting the <br/>\nhang of NOT doing school.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour son is just 8 years old. I cannot find the links (will post them <br/>\nlater) of some of the child development researchers who believe they <br/>\ncan change schools by actually having them throw away academic work <br/>\n----or stave it until kids reach the age of 11 or 12. Your son needs <br/>\nto play and just be and right now you are still trying to cram things <br/>\ndown his throat by being worried about his &quot;academic&quot; future.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about it. isn&#39;t it weird for us to worry about this? Academic <br/>\nwork is what you do when working in a university and writing a <br/>\nthesis. What your son and all children should be doing at the age of <br/>\n8 is playing, growing and being because that is the way that most <br/>\nmammals, including humans, learn. All this academic poppycock is <br/>\nactually stunting children&#39;s, and in the end human, development. <br/>\nSorry about the rant but I get really passionate about this.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou said you did some field trips. I say, do some more. You and your <br/>\nguy need to go on some adventures, get away from it all, and <br/>\nreconnect as mother and child, as Lisa and Nate, and not as teacher <br/>\nand student or &quot;assessor&quot; and &quot;academic achievement grade&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeschooling is going to be a bumpy ride but y&#39;all be fine. You just <br/>\nneed to find the fun in learning and forget about the &#39;academic work&#39; <br/>\n--and when I say you I mean, YOU. Your son said already what he wants <br/>\nand how he wants it. Lisa needs to reassess how she wants to help <br/>\nNate accomplish that. I would start with some chamomile tea and a <br/>\nbubble bath. Oh, and I rented a whole slew of AbFab and Monty Python <br/>\ntapes  --nothing like good ol&#39; brit humor and silliness to put things <br/>\ninto perspective. Then, do things together. Find things the both of <br/>\nyou LOVE, not just like but LOVE doing together. Then, hang out some <br/>\nmore.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust remember to have fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nLiza<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90964014,"authorName":"Lisa Hardiman","from":"&quot;Lisa Hardiman&quot; &lt;lisa-hardiman@...&gt;","profile":"lisalhardiman","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] deschooling","postDate":"1031928685","msgId":9328,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDkwMWMyNWIzNSQwODk5NjRhMCQwMjAxYThjMEBkcmFjb2NvbnN1bHRpbmcuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEI5QTcyMEE3LkQwMTUlZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":9327,"nextInTopic":9329,"prevInTime":9327,"nextInTime":9329,"topicId":2367,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you I understand more.

Go shopping and stop and admire his admiration<br/>\nof<br/>\nwhat he calls you to see.

His &quot;job&quot; is<br/>\nto<br/>\nlive the life of an 8 year old. Let him do and be an 8 year old rather<br/>\nthan<br/>\na product in preparation for adulthood. Kids spend way too much time<br/>\ntraining to be adults. There&#39;s a reason kids are 8. It&#39;s a stage they<br/>\nneed<br/>\nto pass through and he only gets one chance at it! He needs to be<br/>\ninvolved<br/>\nin 8 yo things. *His* 8 yo things. Nintendo. TV. Games. Puzzles.<br/>\nTickling.<br/>\nSeeing if he can cram a whole hamburger into his mouth. ;-) Playing with<br/>\nfriends.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t hand him books. Snuggle up on the couch under a quilt and hot<br/>\nchocolate and read to him. Put books on tape on in the car. Watch movie<br/>\nversions of favorite books and talk about what you liked and didn&#39;t<br/>\nlike.<br/>\nYour job isn&#39;t to make him read. Your job is to make sure he has<br/>\npleasurable<br/>\nexperiences with reading. And has reasons that are meaningful to him to<br/>\nread.

Lately it&#39;s been insects and doesn&#39;t that<br/>\nsound academic?  Also lately he likes to color fuzzy velvet posters.<br/>\n(No<br/>\nElvis so far) but fuzzy velvet posters don&#39;t sound nearly as academic as<br/>\ninsects.  And always it is cartoons and Godzilla and X-files, and<br/>\nM*A*S*H, and Playstation and Gameboy and Calvin and Hobbs and Peanuts.  <br/>\nMy point is that we tend to see certain things as learning and other<br/>\nthings strictly as entertainment.  But I can tell you he&#39;s learned more<br/>\nuseful things from all that entertainment than he has from being able to<br/>\ntell a bee assassin from a milkweed beetle.  That&#39;s cool and impresses<br/>\nbig people but what he really uses every day is his sense of drama, and<br/>\nhumor and compassion and  his quick thinking and dexterity and his<br/>\nobservation skills.  He has an astounding visual memory which helps him<br/>\nall the time.  <br/>\nDylan couldn&#39;t sit down and do the multiplication tables like a third<br/>\ngrader here could do but he can count the money in his wallet and<br/>\ndetermine if there is enough for the things he wants to buy.  He can<br/>\nfigure how much he&#39;ll have left, how much change he&#39;ll get back, how<br/>\nmuch<br/>\nhe needs to save for the next thing.  He plays cribbage with his dad and<br/>\ncan count by 15&#39;s like nobody business.  He can add his score in Yahtzee<br/>\nand that&#39;s because he likes to play.  He&#39;s awsome at SET.  So is he<br/>\nbehind?  Maybe according to the school but not according to his life. <br/>\nWhat he needs in his real life right now he knows or will know as the<br/>\nneed arises because he gets to live and use what he learns.  He has<br/>\nnever<br/>\nencountered a situation in ten years of life that required knowing the<br/>\nmultiplication tables.    <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy does Nate need to read right now Lisa?  He&#39;s not driving around in<br/>\nyour car, he&#39;s not going to work, he&#39;s not walking around town by<br/>\nhimself.   What does he absolutely NEED to read right now that you can&#39;t<br/>\nhelp him with?  <br/>\nThe only reason kids are forced into reading so early at school is for<br/>\nthe convenience of the teachers.   No little kid needs to read at six or<br/>\nseven or eight or even 10 or 12.   Maybe by the time he wants a job, or<br/>\nwants his drivers licence but how far away is that?  In between there is<br/>\nso much time to hear wonderful stories and see great movies and play. <br/>\n(And in fact, my husband works with a man who has his high school<br/>\ndiploma and never learned to read.  He makes an excellent living as an<br/>\nequipment operator, he&#39;s better paid than our Mayor,  has a nice home a<br/>\nlovely wife and a loyal dog.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you start to look at what Nate likes to play as meaningful to his<br/>\nlife<br/>\nright now you will begin to see a world of learning in it.  He doesn&#39;t<br/>\nneed to be measured or judged against someone else&#39;s standard, he just<br/>\nneeds to be a kid and play and have you involved with him.  Just read to<br/>\nhim when he wants, play with him, take him places he likes to go, tell<br/>\nhim what a cool kid he is and how much you like to be with him.  Tell<br/>\nhim<br/>\neverything will be ok.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou already do lots of cool things with your kids Lisa.  You&#39;re doing<br/>\nok.<br/>\nIt&#39;s probably so much easier for moms whose kids never went to school,<br/>\nbecause we don&#39;t have that idea in our minds about what school would<br/>\nexpect.   What if Nate just played and healed and found joy in his life<br/>\neveryday and knew you were proud of him no matter what?  Would you trade<br/>\nthat for reading right now?  Which is more important in his life at this<br/>\nmoment?  <br/>\n<br/>\nLove & Peace,<br/>\nDeb<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

Lately it&#39;s been insects and doesn&#39;t that<br/>\nsound academic?  Also lately he likes to color fuzzy velvet posters.  (No<br/>\nElvis so far) but fuzzy velvet posters don&#39;t sound nearly as academic as<br/>\ninsects.  And always it is cartoons and Godzilla and X-files, and<br/>\nM*A*S*H, and Playstation and Gameboy and Calvin and Hobbs and Peanuts.  <br/>\nMy point is that we tend to see certain things as learning and other<br/>\nthings strictly as entertainment.  But I can tell you he&#39;s learned more<br/>\nuseful things from all that entertainment than he has from being able to<br/>\ntell a bee assassin from a milkweed beetle.  That&#39;s cool and impresses<br/>\nbig people but what he really uses every day is his sense of drama, and<br/>\nhumor and compassion and  his quick thinking and dexterity and his<br/>\nobservation skills.  He has an astounding visual memory which helps him<br/>\nall the time.  <br/>\nDylan couldn&#39;t sit down and do the multiplication tables like a third<br/>\ngrader here could do but he can count the money in his wallet and<br/>\ndetermine if there is enough for the things he wants to buy.  He can<br/>\nfigure how much he&#39;ll have left, how much change he&#39;ll get back, how much<br/>\nhe needs to save for the next thing.  He plays cribbage with his dad and<br/>\ncan count by 15&#39;s like nobody business.  He can add his score in Yahtzee<br/>\nand that&#39;s because he likes to play.  He&#39;s awsome at SET.  So is he<br/>\nbehind?  Maybe according to the school but not according to his life. <br/>\nWhat he needs in his real life right now he knows or will know as the<br/>\nneed arises because he gets to live and use what he learns.  He has never<br/>\nencountered a situation in ten years of life that required knowing the<br/>\nmultiplication tables.    <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy does Nate need to read right now Lisa?  He&#39;s not driving around in<br/>\nyour car, he&#39;s not going to work, he&#39;s not walking around town by<br/>\nhimself.   What does he absolutely NEED to read right now that you can&#39;t<br/>\nhelp him with?  <br/>\nThe only reason kids are forced into reading so early at school is for<br/>\nthe convenience of the teachers.   No little kid needs to read at six or<br/>\nseven or eight or even 10 or 12.   Maybe by the time he wants a job, or<br/>\nwants his drivers licence but how far away is that?  In between there is<br/>\nso much time to hear wonderful stories and see great movies and play. <br/>\n (And in fact, my husband works with a man who has his high school<br/>\ndiploma and never learned to read.  He makes an excellent living as an<br/>\nequipment operator, he&#39;s better paid than our Mayor,  has a nice home a<br/>\nlovely wife and a loyal dog.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you start to look at what Nate likes to play as meaningful to his life<br/>\nright now you will begin to see a world of learning in it.  He doesn&#39;t<br/>\nneed to be measured or judged against someone else&#39;s standard, he just<br/>\nneeds to be a kid and play and have you involved with him.  Just read to<br/>\nhim when he wants, play with him, take him places he likes to go, tell<br/>\nhim what a cool kid he is and how much you like to be with him.  Tell him<br/>\neverything will be ok.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou already do lots of cool things with your kids Lisa.  You&#39;re doing ok.<br/>\n It&#39;s probably so much easier for moms whose kids never went to school,<br/>\nbecause we don&#39;t have that idea in our minds about what school would<br/>\nexpect.   What if Nate just played and healed and found joy in his life<br/>\neveryday and knew you were proud of him no matter what?  Would you trade<br/>\nthat for reading right now?

He&#39;d go with us to <br/>\nthe park or the zoo or the museums, but not always. We did send him (by <br/>\nhimself) to Australia for three weeks and Washington State for four weeks and <br/>\nwe went on family trips to St Louis, Chicago, New York (2x), MA, CT, PA (2x), <br/>\nand Pensacola & Jacksonville, FL. But mostly, he slept a lot and spent time <br/>\nin front of the TV or &#39;puter. The only things he read or wrote were IM&#39;s! <br/>\n(although I picked up many books I thought might interest him from the <br/>\nlibrary and tossed them in his room.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis past month, he wrote a screenplay (in school, he HATED to read or <br/>\nwrite). He and his friends will begin filming next weekend. He&#39;s learned all <br/>\nthis on his own. It&#39;s pretty amazing, too, how well-written it is. (He asked <br/>\nme to look it over and fix things. He had misused lie/lay, so I corrected <br/>\nthat.) He had tons of questions about plots and tension and character <br/>\ndevelopment. He now has tons of questions about lighting and camera <br/>\nwork/angles and editing (he&#39;s also directing the film).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe film deals with typical teen thoughts: boy/girl relationships, drugs & <br/>\nalcohol, differences, and skateboarding &lt;G&gt;---and is sprinkled with music <br/>\n(some of which he&#39;s writing, but mostly from bands he likes). Regular stuff: <br/>\nsex, drugs and rock & roll!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been an amazing few years watching him lose the school mentality. A lot <br/>\nof &quot;veging out&quot;, but he NEEDED that. He&#39;s now waking a bit earlier and <br/>\nwanting to go places with us more and more. As I work on this conference, <br/>\nhe&#39;s taken on almost all of the housework and a lot of the care for his <br/>\nlittle brother---just to help me out.

My then 8yo dd was totally demotivated especially about<br/>\nreading which she had previuosly enjoyed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter taking lots of advice from a lot of people who home educated -<br/>\nunschoolers through to school at homers - I let things be but read all sorts<br/>\nof great books to the childen.  I did not ask them to read I just gave them,<br/>\nthe opportunity to listen and enjoy.  It took a yearto 18mths but I now have<br/>\na daughter who can&#39;t find enough time to erad.  It is her choice and she<br/>\nloves it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my son we built on interests he had in computer games - not educational<br/>\nsoftware but games - he loves Age of Empires and he said he wanted to find<br/>\nout more about the Egyptians so I searched out some fun activities about<br/>\nAncient Egypt.  He mummified apples, made clothes and weapons, looked at<br/>\nlibrary books and this led to a full blown interest in history.  Right now I<br/>\nam reading him a book he found in the adults section of the library about<br/>\nVikings.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also started music lesson which was a non-school activity which they both<br/>\nreally enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found demonstrating the things I value - finding out new things,<br/>\nreading etc in my everyday activities has be a motivator to my children.<br/>\n<br/>\nGive things time - he will deschool but it may take a year or more to<br/>\nhappen.

I need to be pushed in the<br/>\n&gt; direction of good articles to read.  We are keeping our son, Nate,<br/>\n&gt; home<br/>\n&gt; after 1 * years of school.  He is 8 years old.  He had a very<br/>\n&gt; difficult<br/>\n&gt; 2nd grade and had to do some academic work he wasnt ready for.  All<br/>\n&gt; summer, he played and would do nothing of reading or writing, etc.  I<br/>\n&gt; just gave him plenty of space and occasionally offered a book to read.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am trying to deschool myself as well but feel that the 1 * years he<br/>\n&gt; spent in school destroyed his education.  He used to keep a journal<br/>\n&gt; which started with pictures and some written words; he used to try to<br/>\n&gt; add.  He used to play scrabble or chest or do an educational software.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now he is so sour on learning anything academic, and there are days he<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; really pushes my buttons.  Today is one.  I have backed off completely<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; anything academic and we have taken a few field trips.  I dont why he<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; is testing me so much.  Is this a message that he rather be in school?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would go along with that but he failed  according to the system.<br/>\n&gt; His teacher must have read How Children Fail  and applied it<br/>\n&gt; continually all year.  There was very little I could do for him.  We<br/>\n&gt; decided to finish that school year, and than we allowed Nate to<br/>\n&gt; envision<br/>\n&gt; his future in education.  He said that he could not handled having<br/>\n&gt; things crammed down his throat.  I have tried to back off.  I dont<br/>\n&gt; know<br/>\n&gt; what to do anymore.  I recall reading in a Home Education magazine<br/>\n&gt; that a mom pulled a 9th grader from class and didnt offer anything<br/>\n&gt; academic for a year.  He was a special needs kid in school and when he<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; graduated from home school he went on to go to law school.  Am I<br/>\n&gt; suppressing my fear of his not succeeding if he has no academic<br/>\n&gt; background.  I know I cant put him in school now.  He would be a<br/>\n&gt; light<br/>\n&gt; year behind his class and would be broken down.  Please I am open to<br/>\n&gt; all<br/>\n&gt; kinds of advise and reading.  Thank you.
