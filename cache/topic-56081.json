There was a recent photo, and an  <br/>\nolder one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/people/leifivarson\">http://sandradodd.com/people/leifivarson</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe second photo on this page has Karen, the one who needed to write  <br/>\nan essay in the late 1980&#39;s.  She&#39;s the third woman standing--the  <br/>\ntallest one, in white with a white veil.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dark-haired man with the chain mail is my friend Jeff.  I mention  <br/>\nhim sometimes.  Karen was his girlfriend in those days.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe man kneeling in steel and leather armor is Leif (Bill Hammond),  <br/>\nwho died yesterday in an accident at a power plant where he worked in  <br/>\nNevada.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was being knighted.  The night before, I had been at Leif&#39;s vigil.   <br/>\nI had known him for years, and the vigil was in a tent I had made.  In  <br/>\nthat discussion with him that evening, and in a story I&#39;ve told many  <br/>\ntimes in the SCA and to unschoolers, I came up with the &quot;make the  <br/>\nbetter choice&quot; idea that&#39;s helped me and others in those 23 years.    <br/>\nLeif was saying that he was worried about being a knight, but not  <br/>\nhaving a really medieval-looking camp.  The two of us were sitting by  <br/>\ncandlelight, in that tent I had made, which was well furnished.  I  <br/>\ntold him that our gear (mine and Keith&#39;s, and Steve&#39;s, and Marks--some  <br/>\nother friends he had specified as having nice camps) were always  <br/>\nevolving--that as we found better furniture or dishes or lanterns, we  <br/>\nreplaced the less impressive bits.  I said if he was going to buy a  <br/>\ntent and his only choices were canvas or nylon, to choose canvas.  If  <br/>\nhe had decided on canvas and his choices were orange or brown, choose  <br/>\nbrown.  And incrementally his camp would get better,  if he always  <br/>\nmade the more medieval choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby was eight months old at the time of that event.  I was going to  <br/>\nLa Leche League, and Adult Children of Alcoholics meetings, and  <br/>\nlearning to be a mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter years of using the &quot;better choice&quot; tool in the SCA and at home,  <br/>\nI mentioned that idea in a talk I gave in Sacramento in August 2002, I  <br/>\ntold that story and recommended that if a mom&#39;s two choices were to  <br/>\nhit or to yell, choose &quot;yell.&quot;  And the next time, yell or speak more  <br/>\nquietly.  And the *next* time...  Think of two choices, and make the  <br/>\nbetter choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the photo,  the man being touched on the head with a spear (I don&#39;t  <br/>\nremember why they didn&#39;t use the sword) was Leif.  That was within  <br/>\ntwelve hours of the &quot;make the better choice&quot; night.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes ideas can be documented.  But I didn&#39;t set out to document  <br/>\nit.  Leif died yesterday, and a photo brought forth by another friend  <br/>\nincludes Karen who wrote about the Women&#39;s Movement.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Kirby was a toddler, we were at a medieval event in Colorado.   <br/>\nKirby tripped over a twine divider, with stakes and with twine about  <br/>\nsix inches off the ground, marking where they were going to put a  <br/>\nlarger fence for the tourney field.  I helped Kirby up and knelt down  <br/>\nand showed him the string he had tripped on, and showed him where it  <br/>\nwas, and why it was there.  Leif was standing nearby and heard the  <br/>\nwhole thing.  He came and told me I was a really good mom and he was  <br/>\nimpressed at how I was with Kirby.  Then he got tears in his eyes and  <br/>\ntold me for the first time that he had gotten a girlfriend pregnant  <br/>\nwhen they were teens (I think he was 30 or so at the time he was  <br/>\ntelling it), and he had never met the baby.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s part of what gave me the deep knowledge that if one of my boys  <br/>\ngot a girl pregnant, he would still be a father but might not  <br/>\nnecessarily be able to be a good father, no matter how much he might  <br/>\nwant to be there.  That idea was discussed recently too, on this list  <br/>\nor in a chat, but I didn&#39;t mention Leif&#39;s tears and confession of  <br/>\nthinking of his unknown daughter when he saw others with their children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t expect all those things to tie in as they have with recent  <br/>\ndiscussions, and that photo.   I think it&#39;s evidence that that living  <br/>\na rich life with the expectation that sharing ideas will help people  <br/>\nin unpredictable ways will create and maintain a flow of benefit that  <br/>\ngoes beyond the person, and beyond the family, into the larger world.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n(here&#39;s an intermediate riff on the choice making:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/humility/formality4.html\">http://sandradodd.com/humility/formality4.html</a>  1998 )</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55956,"nextTopicId":56054}}
