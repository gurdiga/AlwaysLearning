You&#39;re like my friend.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe often will come up and hug me out of the blue, even in public.  She loves spending time with her Dad and I. There&#39;s no eye rolling, no &quot;I hate you!&quot;, no &quot;you&#39;re ruining my life!&quot;, no &quot;but everybody else&#39;s parents....&quot;  She&#39;s watching me admit and deal with my weakness and it&#39;s helping her recognize and deal with hers.  The growth and maturity that I&#39;ve watched in her, simply because I&#39;ve been willing to sit back and allow her to blossom, is amazing!<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you to all of you who are willing to share your insight and experiences to help us love our kids better!<br/>\n<br/>\nDebbie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":255388392,"authorName":"Kelly Halldorson","from":"&quot;Kelly Halldorson&quot; &lt;kelly@...&gt;","profile":"kellygrafx","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] sometimes I cannot comment at all, at all, at all","postDate":"1276919529","msgId":55071,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc4OUFEODM0NjY0MjRGRDRBMkMxNjE1MjQ0RUU2QTI2QFBIUFZpZGVvVkFJTz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJCRTkxRjY2LUNBRjktNDM3RC04MUE2LTQzMjdFOEZCNjZGOUBTYW5kcmFEb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEJCRTkxRjY2LUNBRjktNDM3RC04MUE2LTQzMjdFOEZCNjZGOUBTYW5kcmFEb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":55070,"nextInTopic":55088,"prevInTime":55070,"nextInTime":55072,"topicId":55070,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"++++I m grateful that my children have always been people I enjoyed spending time with, and still do.

And all three times were completely random. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 12 year old daughter hugged me as we were getting out of the car an hour ago and said, &quot;Thank-you for being my mother. I mean I didn&#39;t have any choice in the matter but if I did....I wouldn&#39;t have picked anyone else. So, thank-you.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last one is a variation on something I&#39;ve said *to* her since she was little, very little. I&#39;ve always randomly hugged them and said, &quot;thank-you so much for being my kid. I love you.&quot; My mother used to tell me, &quot;I should have given you up for adoption.&quot; I never wanted my kids to hear that...so I turned it around from the beginning. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt feels amazing to be loved so genuinely at the same time I&#39;m seeing kids I know my kids age joining facebook groups called &quot;I hate my parents&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\npeace,<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Switch to: Text-Only, Daily Digest .
