That pretty much describes our journey too.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIt reminds me of the movie Shrek  and his onion analogy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think someone else has made this comparison also, but can&#39;t remember if it was on this list or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n I feel like our layers are layers that have been heaped onto ourselves from years and years of nodding our heads and going along with what was &#39;good&#39;.     Making kids do things, eating certain things and behaving a certain way.    Alot of main stream thinking.      <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are now peeling away those layers!  Our unschooling life began in homeschooling (the first layer) and continuued its way into our lives. (the next layers)  It led me into reevaluating so many more avenues than I would have ever expected.    It goes to prove that you can&#39;t just say that unschooling is an education or such,  its a  way of life.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to go into this more but I am out of town right now and my computer usage is somewhat limited!   &lt;g&gt;     <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKelli <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
