It is so different in a stand<br/>\nalone, I&#39;m enjoying thinking about that!<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep thinking about the part of being unrelated to our own selves and<br/>\nhow that relates to service to others!  I do things for my kids all the<br/>\ntime.  It&#39;s totally related to myself though, very much so, because it<br/>\nis out of my love for my kids that I do things for them.  I feel good<br/>\nwhen I&#39;ve done something nice for them, especially if it wasn&#39;t<br/>\nexpected.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I was reading what Sandra wrote and it&#39;s a bit about doing laundry,<br/>\nwhich is funny because we just had our own laundry story happen and it&#39;s<br/>\ntotally related!  Yesterday I washed Chamille&#39;s bedding.  It&#39;s been a<br/>\nwhile because she didn&#39;t want me to wash them.  I thought it was making<br/>\nher room smell bad, and she has a stuffy nose so she couldn&#39;t smell and<br/>\nwhen her nose suddenly works again, it would be nice to smell pleasant<br/>\nsmells rather than stinky ones.  So, while she was out and about<br/>\nyesterday, I asked if I could please wash her bedding for her and she<br/>\nlet me.  I wasn&#39;t trying to be weird and bossy about it, or make her do<br/>\nsomething she didn&#39;t want to do, I really wanted her to have a pleasant<br/>\nexperience sleeping in clean bedding, since I know it&#39;s something she<br/>\nreally does enjoy!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt made me feel good to do that for my daughter, and she was really<br/>\nsweet and requested to make it herself after it was all clean, something<br/>\nwhich she has never done before.  She wants a nest, not a traditional<br/>\nbed, and she knew how she wanted it done, and doing it was easier than<br/>\nexplaining it to me.  Frankly, I was happy to oblige because her bed is<br/>\nhard to make, it&#39;s against 2 walls and it&#39;s a bottom bunk of a bunk bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that to say, that we were doing things for ourselves and each other.<br/>\nChamille didn&#39;t do something for me, even though it was mutually<br/>\nbeneficial.  I did something for her, that made me feel good about being<br/>\nher mother, and it was something that she appreciated but wasn&#39;t<br/>\npressing for her to have done.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of her friends have to wash their own clothes and bedding, as I did<br/>\nwhen I was her age.  It happened every week.  I HAD to strip my bed and<br/>\npile all my laundry and start the wash, even if I didn&#39;t think my<br/>\nbedding was dirty.  It wasn&#39;t something that I did for me, I did it<br/>\nbecause if I hadn&#39;t, I wouldn&#39;t have been able to leave the house to go<br/>\ndo stuff with my friends.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":229442577,"authorName":"Kris","from":"Kris &lt;kris1956@...&gt;","profile":"louisam1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Service and relationships","postDate":"1239855550","msgId":44066,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZkZWM0OGIwOTA0MTUyMTE5czNjOTA4NjI2bGQ0YmQwMWM3YjZlMDBjOThAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDY1MThhOTM2MDkwNDE1MTIxNmoxMmQ0YzM5Y2c3ZmE0NjNiMmJkNmEzNGJmQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PEE4RURBQUYxLUFCMTgtNDBDMi1BOTcyLTc0MzIwNURCNTY0RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JIDw2NTE4YTkzNjA5MDQxNTEyMTZqMTJkNGMzOWNnN2ZhNDYzYjJiZDZhMzRiZkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":44062,"nextInTopic":44072,"prevInTime":44065,"nextInTime":44067,"topicId":44061,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I, unfortunately, have those moments too and they serve us best as a comparison.

They don&#39;t give us anything good or valuable otherwise.  The<br/>\nkind choice, on the other hand, brings ME happiness from the get-go, it<br/>\nbrings happiness for all of us on a &quot;time release&quot; basis.  The peace is like<br/>\na snow ball, the first kind choice leads to another and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish it was like a pill, a sample for families to try.  If they could<br/>\nexperience just a moment of the reality these choices bring I think they<br/>\nwould be eager to find out how to make it happen.  For me, it takes slapping<br/>\nthe &quot;don&#39;t let them get away with anything&quot; voice instilled by my parents<br/>\nout of my head.  Without that I can see my kids for who they really are and<br/>\ntrust their intentions.

It heals the child for whom few grownups made the<br/>\nkinder choice. It prevents damage to the child whose grownups strive to make<br/>\nthe kinder choice.<br/>\nWhen I *do* make the less kind choice (oooh did I have a crabby, snappy<br/>\nweekend!), sincere remorse and sincere forgiveness are part of the process<br/>\n-- not forced, real and true. (I had a big ol snotty cryfest and felt MUCH<br/>\nrelieved) Because I create the same space for his less kind moments, too.<br/>\nFunny thing is, they dissapate in a big space ;) And then we&#39;re free to<br/>\nStart Over and pick kindness in the right now.<br/>\nMarty&#39;s why it&#39;s easy to keep Sandra&#39;s voice in my head; their relationship<br/>\n(and the relationships she has with all three kids) inspires me to follow<br/>\ntheir lead, fostering what keeps us together and weeding out what pulls us<br/>\napart (usually my own junk).
