Or if the control is difficult, at  <br/>\nleast the ability to have the desire and intention to behave and react  <br/>\nin ways that are good for the other people around us.

The idea of  <br/>\n&quot;philosophy&quot; has become too associated with being &quot;a doctor of  <br/>\nphilosophy&quot; and reading what people in 19th century Germany and France  <br/>\nthought, what medieval mystics and heretics thought, and what ancient  <br/>\nGreeks and Romans thought.  I think people can &quot;be philosophers&quot; (for  <br/>\nhaving a piece of paper) while hardly having any useful, practical  <br/>\nphilosophy of their own.  They&#39;re not being philosophers, they&#39;re  <br/>\nstudying the history of philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, back at the unschooling ranch, as it were, we&#39;re finding  <br/>\nthe basic questions of how to be and why, and of the meaning of choice  <br/>\nand freedom, and of perceptions and connections and ethics and  <br/>\nmorality to be a part of eating and drinking, of sleeping and breathing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":383312070,"authorName":"Cara Barlow","from":"Cara Barlow &lt;carabarlow@...&gt;","profile":"crbrlw","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: unschooling and spirituality","postDate":"1257081011","msgId":48228,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdhMDlmNDFmMDkxMTAxMDUxMHA0NTA1NTY1M3k1N2NkNjBmMjU2M2VkNjA0QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhjaTkydisxOTczQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDdhMDlmNDFmMDkxMDMwMTEyMnE3ZWM4YTVlNGg2ZTM3MTYyZGFmMDk2NTM5QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgkgPGhjaTkydisxOTczQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48222,"nextInTopic":48234,"prevInTime":48227,"nextInTime":48229,"topicId":48205,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" I need","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1070494047\">&lt;&lt;&lt;For me there absolutely is a connection.

You could draw the analogy that unschooling is to schooling what spirituality is to organised religion.  At one end of the spectrum there is individual, free-flowing, immediate daily experience, and at the other there is a top-down, codified institution.  Throwing out &#39;belief in God&#39; doesn&#39;t have to mean disconnecting from the idea of &#39;the numinous&#39; (ie. something beyond ourselves), any more than throwing out schooling doesn&#39;t mean the end of learning. It&#39;s in what we choose to do every day, how we treat ourselves, other people, the world around us, that we enact our principles.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the keys to unschooling that I&#39;ve learned about from this list is being able to see things from your child&#39;s point of view.  It&#39;s a jolt of realisation for me when I suddenly see that my 4 year old daughter Ashlin is *her own person*.  She does not have to conform to my timetables or agendas.  If I ask her to change out of her fairy dress into pyjamas, it doesn&#39;t mean she has to do it *right now*.  Many times I have seen a complete stonewalling of a child&#39;s intentions.  By trying to stay open, to see beyond myself, I am aiming for a meshing of our interests, rather that a clash.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sometimes think that my children are training me to be a better parent.  I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the best way to put it, but what I mean is that through interacting with them every day, I am learning to be more open, more patient, more loving.  Although I do occasionally slip back into old reactions, I can truly say that the anger inside me is fading.  I can (usually!) control it, it doesn&#39;t control me.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the concepts discussed here is wholeness. A child&#39;s &#39;wholeness&#39; to me is their sense of self-worth, their sense that they have a place in the world, and that they can express themselves freely.  It could also mean that my children are not my possessions. They are not things that I can manipulate at will.  In stepping beyond myself to see my child as a person in herself, this to me is the spiritual dimension of unschooling.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":383312070,"authorName":"Cara Barlow","from":"Cara Barlow &lt;carabarlow@...&gt;","profile":"crbrlw","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"unschooling and spirituality","postDate":"1256926922","msgId":48205,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdhMDlmNDFmMDkxMDMwMTEyMnE3ZWM4YTVlNGg2ZTM3MTYyZGFmMDk2NTM5QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":48222,"prevInTime":48204,"nextInTime":48206,"topicId":48205,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Everyone: A few days ago I was asked what my spiritual practices were.

I<br/>\nwas thrown off stride by the question - I think about spirituality often -<br/>\nit&#39;s a regular part of my world, but I don&#39;t have a practice, like setting<br/>\naside a certain amount of time each day for meditation, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I mumbled something about my spiritual practice being how I<br/>\ninteracted with my children. I&#39;m sure it didn&#39;t make any sense to the<br/>\nquestioners. It wasn&#39;t even very clear to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more I thought about what were my spiritual practices, the more<br/>\nsimilarities I saw between my spiritual practices (being kind, recognizing<br/>\nbeauty, wanting to know more) and unschooling- it&#39;s organically there, all<br/>\nthe time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave any of you thought about how unschooling has affected your<br/>\nspirituality?
