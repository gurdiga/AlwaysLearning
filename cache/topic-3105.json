I left them<br/>\nalone.  John (5) can use the remote so he can put on a<br/>\nshow he likes or his brother likes.  It was hard, for<br/>\nme, and at first they watched a lot of tv.  Then they<br/>\nstarted to turn it off.  They found their limit.  It<br/>\nis the same with sweets.  I limited food choices for a<br/>\nlong time.  They decide what they want for breakfast,<br/>\nlunch, snacks, and when to eat it.  I usually pick<br/>\ndinner, but they can choose something else if they<br/>\nwant.  We have had days where Alexander (4yo) will<br/>\nwant only sugary food.  But we have other days where<br/>\nhe wants only brocoli and carrots w/rice.  He is<br/>\nhealthy, that is what *really* matters.  <br/>\nWhat it comes down to, for me, is this, when I limit<br/>\nthem they cannot learn their own limit.  When I let<br/>\nthem choose, they learn how much they can handle.  Our<br/>\nbodies crave the food we need (of course not ALL<br/>\ncravings are needs) and how much time we need to do<br/>\ncertain activities.  Have you ever noticed that when<br/>\nyou deny yourself a craving, it only increases?  I<br/>\nneed to read for a while every day, that is my way to<br/>\nrelax.  My kids at this stage use the tv for that. <br/>\nThey have huge amounts of energy and need to run<br/>\naround a little every day.  I make sure they have a<br/>\nsafe place to do that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, my suggestion is, let them be.  They will be okay<br/>\nand you will feel better without fighting them.  Trust<br/>\nis hard, but that is one of the things kids need most<br/>\nfrom their parents.  It is important to remember that<br/>\nkids are people with feelings, ideas, and thoughts of<br/>\ntheir own.  Think about how you would feel in their<br/>\nposition.  Do you like to feel controlled by some one<br/>\nelse?  Have some one tell you to stop the activity you<br/>\nare enjoying?  I don&#39;t.  Neither do my kids.  That<br/>\ndoes not mean that I am not here for them if they want<br/>\nsuggestions though.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t read others responses, but I am sure you<br/>\nwill get plenty of good advice.  I hope you will<br/>\nconsider it.<br/>\nNamaste,<br/>\nKitrina<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGreat stuff seeking new owners in Yahoo!
