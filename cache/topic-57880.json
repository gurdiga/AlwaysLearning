If he wants to know why, you can talk about how the way schools teach interferes with learning ¡V not a lot, just say that they do. In order for him to learn without school, he needs a break from schoolish stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\nRay was nervous about unschooling when he came home at 13. He was nervous that if I didn¡¦t tell him what to learn, there must be some secret agenda (his bio mom has lots of secret agendas, so he had good reason to worry!). So it helped him to have a framework for why he wasn¡¦t expected to be doing school-like things ¡§independently¡¨ ¡V which was what he thought unschooling would be like at first. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I feel as if I would have to offer a lot here and there, drive them  <br/>\n&gt; around and do things that might interest them. But I don&#39;t want to  <br/>\n&gt; take that role; on the other hand I do<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Depending on what you mean, offering and taking kids places and doing things with them is a big, important part of unschooling. Its easy to fall into a rut where kids (like adults) do things more on auto-pilot than because its what they really want to be doing. They¡¦ll need your help keeping their world big and fresh and open¡K eventually. Right now though, they need time to deschool so the help they need is different. They need you to hang out with them and offer plenty of love and care. Make fun snacks, offer fun movies, offer to learn to play a video game so you can play two-player games¡K whatever sorts of fun they like. Think of fun out-of-the-house things, too ¡V what might you do on vacation? What would be fun?<br/>\n<br/>\nEventually that kind of thinking and planning will be part of your unschooling life, but more often it will be in response to what your kids enjoy already. Right now, their ability to enjoy life is a bit hampered, so it will be up to you to be gentle and kind and offer light-hearted fun that doesn¡¦t look anything like a ¡§learning experience¡¨.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Am I just acting egotistically, because this gives me also lots of  <br/>\n&gt; free time, or do I really do this for them?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That¡¦s a really important question to ask yourself! Unschooling isn¡¦t necessarily easier or more laid-back. Teens, especially, often want to get out and do things, so expecting unschooling to give you a lot of free time can set you up for a lot of frustration. <br/>\n<br/>\n«\tWhy is it so difficult to just trust<br/>\n<br/>\nHow much were you trusted as a child? How much do you trust yourself now? Some of that is going to come into play ¡V that¡¦s why parents need to deschool too, often More than kids, we have decades more baggage saying ¡§you can¡¦t, you¡¦re not (qualified, old enough, ready, smart enough, rich enough, whatever)¡¨.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And how is it possible, that two  <br/>\n&gt; boys can sit in front of a tv and pc for 12 hours straight? Cause it  <br/>\n&gt; was always restricted, okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And because they need time to relax and decompress. School puts a lot of pressure on kids! They need time to heal from all that pressure. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlus, you wrote that it has only been two months ¡V so they don¡¦t yet have any reason to trust that this will last. That¡¦s part of why people binge on something that has been limited ¡V you never know when you¡¦ll get it again, so get all you can Now. Heck, I do that with seasonal fruits and veggies to some extent! Once they have a sense that the tv will always be there (and they get caught up on all their favorite shows) the watching will grow less and they¡¦ll become more discriminating, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor now, sit with them at least part of the day. If any of your interests can be accomplished in the same room, find a way to do that. See what they find interesting and what they¡¦re watching just because they can ¡V you don¡¦t have to say anything about that, just notice, so you can start to get a sense of what they enjoy. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Ideas for a place where it&#39;s illegal","postDate":"1287982177","msgId":57890,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ2RjE2NDhFLUE4M0YtNDcxNS1CODhELUQ5MjE0ODY2MEVENkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDE3MjYyOC41NTM1Mi5xbUB3ZWI1MzkwNS5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PEUwRDIwODA2LTkyRkYtNDc5Ny1CNzdGLTE5RUI2REMzRTM0MkBTYW5kcmFEb2RkLmNvbT4gPDMxNzYxMS40MDExOC5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDYubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPiA8MTcyNjI4LjU1MzUyLnFtQHdlYjUzOTA1Lm1haWwucmUyLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":57888,"nextInTopic":57897,"prevInTime":57889,"nextInTime":57891,"topicId":57880,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-In our house, anything to break the rut of watching, even for a few minutes often leads to new ideas.-=- But you could be preventing the acquisition and the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1873338290\">-=-In our house, anything to break the rut of watching, even for a few  <br/>\nminutes<br/>\noften leads to new ideas.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you could be preventing the acquisition and the spark of new idea  <br/>\nby &quot;breaking the rut.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you refer to watching television as a rut that needs to be  <br/>\nbroken, you say more than you meant to.<br/>\nYou might have said more than you knew you were thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they were reading books, would you be relieved that something  <br/>\n(anything) broke the rut of reading?<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129999023,"authorName":"John and Amanda Slater","from":"John and Amanda Slater &lt;fourslaterz@...&gt;","profile":"fourslaterz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Ideas for a place where it&#39;s illegal","postDate":"1287973344","msgId":57888,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3MjYyOC41NTM1Mi5xbUB3ZWI1MzkwNS5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDMxNzYxMS40MDExOC5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDYubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PEUwRDIwODA2LTkyRkYtNDc5Ny1CNzdGLTE5RUI2REMzRTM0MkBTYW5kcmFEb2RkLmNvbT4gPDMxNzYxMS40MDExOC5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDYubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57887,"nextInTopic":57890,"prevInTime":57887,"nextInTime":57889,"topicId":57880,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We have a similar dynamic with the TV here.

But this is a rational thought and a plan and I don&#39;t <br/>\nfeel right telling him that and even with this I don&#39;t know exactly <br/>\nwhy. Just letting them seems so easy.***<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be better if the focus isn&#39;t on losing TV as a big interest.  Accept <br/>\nthat it is right now a big interest.  All kids have is right now.  It&#39;s possible <br/>\nthat TV will always be a big interest.  Some kids really like TV.  Some kids <br/>\ngrow up and become actors or producers or directors or animators or sound <br/>\ntechnicians or advertisers.  Those are interesting fields to get into.  But, <br/>\nthat shouldn&#39;t be the focus either.  The focus is on right now.  He likes TV <br/>\nright now and until that interest changes, engage him in what he likes right <br/>\nnow.  Offer more and different and better TV options, watch together, talk about <br/>\nthings, build things while you watch, find more games for the PC, offer more <br/>\noptions.  Eventually one thing leads to the next and in the ever expanding <br/>\nworld, he&#39;ll absorb more and learn more and connect more dots.  One day you&#39;ll <br/>\nbe out and about and he&#39;ll surprise you with something he knows that&#39;s really <br/>\ncool and when you ask where he learned it, he&#39;ll tell you the show from TV that <br/>\nhe learned it from.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Am I just acting egotistically, because this gives me also lots of <br/>\nfree time, or do I really do this for them?<br/>\nWhy is it so difficult to just trust? And how is it possible, that two <br/>\nboys can sit in front of a tv and pc for 12 hours straight?***<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy contented TV watching is great, but why they are watching is important <br/>\ntoo.  If it&#39;s because there aren&#39;t any other options, then that&#39;s not a good <br/>\nthing.  Watch with them.  Bring things into their space to do with them.  Go <br/>\nplaces if you can.  If homeschooling or unschooling is illegal then you should <br/>\nstep it up at home and get out after school hours.  It doesn&#39;t need to look like <br/>\nschool or curriculum, but you should be able to see learning happening and be <br/>\nable to describe it academically.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe parents tend to need way more deschooling than the kids!<br/>\n<br/>\n***What do I tell my boys? &quot;You know best what&#39;s good for you..&quot; doesn&#39;t <br/>\nsound right. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t say anything like that.  I&#39;d spend more time with them and talk more <br/>\nand be more engaged and through that find real talking points and real ideas to <br/>\nplay with.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Joyce&#39;s awesome analogies!!!","postDate":"1287961582","msgId":57885,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc4REM2QTNGLUMwQkEtNDYyQi05MDY4LUU3MTE4NDQ5RUVGMEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDRDQxRTQ1Qzg3MkRGMS0yMkZDLTE2RjQ0QHdlYm1haWwtZDA1Mi5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEUwRDIwODA2LTkyRkYtNDc5Ny1CNzdGLTE5RUI2REMzRTM0MkBTYW5kcmFEb2RkLmNvbT4gPDk1NUIwMDlDLUQ0MjgtNEQ5QS05ODY2LThGMjEyQUUzNkFCRkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4gPEEwRUVEMTIyLUZBODktNDBCNC1CN0Y5LUQyQjg2RUUxQkEyOUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDhDRDQxRTQ1Qzg3MkRGMS0yMkZDLTE2RjQ0QHdlYm1haWwtZDA1Mi5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":57884,"nextInTopic":57886,"prevInTime":57884,"nextInTime":57886,"topicId":57880,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-The bucket and the pool was awesome too!-=- You re right.

Adding a bucket each day would keep it  <br/>\nbalanced. If you don&#39;t add water to it each day, it will keep draining  <br/>\nuntil it&#39;s empty. If you then added just a bucket a day, it wouldn&#39;t  <br/>\nfill. If you only added 2 buckets a day, it would take months and  <br/>\nmonths to fill. But if you turned the hose on and just let it run  <br/>\nuntil the pool was filled, *then* you could add just a bucket a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now they&#39;re in the let the hose run stage.

Things you love that  <br/>\nwere very limited won&#39;t suddenly feel normal if there&#39;s a surplus. It  <br/>\ntakes a while to fill up, takes a while for the emotions to trust the  <br/>\nhead&#39;s knowledge. Just knowing that TV and computers are unlimited now  <br/>\nisn&#39;t enough for the emotions to trust it. They need to experience it  <br/>\nfor months before the newness wears off and unlimited feels normal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And the other thing is the<br/>\n&gt; question, how much do I lead and offer, and when is it beginning to be<br/>\n&gt; too much?

You need to get to know them and their needs and  <br/>\nlet go of any voices that are telling you what kids-in-general need.  <br/>\nYou need to learn to listen to what they need.<br/>\n<br/>\n*But* what&#39;s especially confusing right now is your kids don&#39;t  <br/>\nnecessarily know what they need right now. They know what they were  <br/>\ntold they need. They know what other kids are told they need. They  <br/>\nknow they were told their own needs weren&#39;t as important as what  <br/>\nadults wanted for them. So right now they&#39;re confused too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s normal. Uncomfortable! but normal. Reassure them that they&#39;ll  <br/>\nfeel a bit off balance as their pools fill up. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you can do is make sure the doors to other interesting  <br/>\nopportunities are kept open.

Wendy and her children Bob and John (my  <br/>\ncharacters in the slightly edited version).<br/>\n<br/>\n===========================================<br/>\n<br/>\n[It started out saying the mom has found a way to make this work even  <br/>\nthough homeschooling isn&#39;t legal, and they&#39;ve been unschooling for two  <br/>\nmonths.]<br/>\n<br/>\nI found a way to do it and I especially love what I read about the  <br/>\nunschooling. But I need your help with something. My sons are [about  <br/>\n9/10/11] and [three years older]  and they made very different school  <br/>\nexperiences. [Bob, the older one] made very bad ones and [John] I took  <br/>\nout before he would make them..now, Bob likes to watch TV all day,  <br/>\nJohn not really but he is not following his own way yet cause he  <br/>\nthinks if Bob watches so much tv he should do this too or play pc games.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am very new with unschooling and deschooling myself, as is Bob.   <br/>\nJohn asks for learning not to get stupid, as he says.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem at the moment is the difference in the kids&#39; needs.  <br/>\nProbably its a question of having the trust, that John will find his  <br/>\nown way, that I should just let him. And the other thing is the  <br/>\nquestion, how much do I lead and offer, and when is it beginning to be  <br/>\ntoo much? Me personally, I would love to just let them do what they  <br/>\nwant, and also just follow my own interests, but now my own interests  <br/>\nseem to me egotistic to follow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel as if I would have to offer a lot here and there, drive them  <br/>\naround and do things that might interest them. But I don&#39;t want to  <br/>\ntake that role; on the other hand I do, but I have no way yet.  It&#39;s  <br/>\nall very confusing and sometimes all so natural.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn today asked me, why I let them watch tv all day and play computer  <br/>\ngames and I couldn&#39;t really answer it. I said I want them to do what  <br/>\nthey like to do and then he asked me if they can do this everyday and  <br/>\nI didn&#39;t know what to answer. I felt silly and confusing to John. How  <br/>\nto explain something I just develop?<br/>\n<br/>\nI want them to see tv just as a normal option, so that it loses its  <br/>\nbig interest. But this is a rational thought and a plan and I don&#39;t  <br/>\nfeel right telling him that and even with this I don&#39;t know exactly  <br/>\nwhy.  Just letting them seems so easy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I just acting egotistically, because this gives me also lots of  <br/>\nfree time, or do I really do this for them?<br/>\nWhy is it so difficult to just trust? And how is it possible, that two  <br/>\nboys can sit in front of a tv and pc for 12 hours straight? Cause it  <br/>\nwas always restricted, okay. I want to change but I often don&#39;t know  <br/>\nhow to explain and how to combine all different interests, including  <br/>\nmine. Sorry for my insecurity..<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do I tell my boys? &quot;You know best what&#39;s good for you..&quot; doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nsound right.  I read so much but don&#39;t have the right words yet..I  <br/>\nhope you have the time to help me with your experience. Thanks for  <br/>\nyour great website.
