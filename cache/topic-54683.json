Snapping quick photos might be an alternative to taking notes -- use the date-stamp on your camera if it has that option, then use the pics to jog your memory when you have to put things on paper.

Sandra, you did not comment on why you agreed that homeschool to unschool was more difficult than a switch from public school to unschool. I thought about it since, and think it&#39;s because public school to homeschool you think you can do better than them. Homeschool to unschool feels like you won&#39;t be doing enough, or as well as the public schools. Does that make sense?***<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s because public school and home school are both school, follow a curriculum, lock step, linear path, to get from point A to point Z, don&#39;t veer off path and you get to your destination and call yourself done.  Unschooling isn&#39;t like that at all.  There&#39;s no curriculum, no lock step, linear path, no point A or even a point Z, and if there were, you could veer off the path at any time.  There isn&#39;t a final destination, except for the ones that you create for yourself along the way.<br/>\n<br/>\n***It is the younger two who I am worried about.

She&#39;s about to be 18, that magical age of being &quot;done&quot; and moving out and being an adult.  Would it help to think of it as just another birthday?  Maybe you could rethink the idea of &quot;being 18&quot; and insert another older age in there as the final age, say 22.  Does that make it seem better?  If you can accept the idea that all kids grow and learn and mature at different stages and ages, doesn&#39;t it make sense to continue on that way, even in young adulthood?  Give her more time to find her way.  Add more things into her life that you know she&#39;ll love.  Find a way to help her travel to encourage her love of geography.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Suggestions about unschoolers camps or retreats are not going to fly here. We are not financially able to send them away this year. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps you could sell all your curriculum on ebay and have enough money to send one or both kids somewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n***How can I make a transcript if they haven&#39;t spent enough time on it to be a credit?***<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you know they haven&#39;t and who gets to decide how much time is enough time?  Does the time inside ones own head daydreaming count?  How about sitting watching TV with the textbook open on their lap, does that count for hours?<br/>\n<br/>\n ***I think it&#39;s partly as parents, you want to give your child every opportunity to succeed in what they choose for their life, and I don&#39;t want to mess things up for her.***<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, that&#39;s really common!  Parents who put their kids in school are absolutely SURE that by doing so they aren&#39;t going to mess up their kids and if somehow they do get &quot;messed up&quot;, it&#39;s not their fault, it&#39;s the schools, and the schools would blame the kids or the parents.  That phrase, &quot;opportunity to succeed&quot; is such a catch phrase.  Schools use it all the time, yet what I see, is that they give equal opportunities to fail, because it&#39;s not really about giving someone opportunities.  Kids succeed when they have the freedom to do so and the knowledge that they can.  All the other circumstances can either help or hinder.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe way that unschooling works, is giving a kid freedom to explore opportunities, real ones, it&#39;s about fostering that deep inside knowledge within a person that they CAN succeed, it&#39;s a sense of really knowing oneself.  When I see grown and near to grown unschooled kids, what I find most striking is their sense of self, how they know themselves so well and are able to see the world very clearly because of it.  That clarity helps kids see opportunities and take them.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":187853867,"authorName":"aldq75","from":"&quot;aldq75&quot; &lt;aldq75@...&gt;","profile":"aldq75","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: intro and questions","postDate":"1276195192","msgId":54840,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGh1cmJobytxZWYwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDRDMTEwRDZFLjgwNDA1MDVAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":54836,"nextInTopic":54844,"prevInTime":54839,"nextInTime":54841,"topicId":54683,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you for sharing your thoughts, Pam.

(I&#39;ll just focus on the 17 yo)The 17 yo is not sure what she wants to do, and I think after all these years of using curriculum, she feels like she will be &quot;flailing&quot; without it.  She is interested in geography-not landforms and such...she likes to know the cultures and interesting facts about the people and places (I don&#39;t know how much she would delve into this, but has shown great interest in the past).  She would like to volunteer walking dogs.  She has been compiling a book for a friend that has quotes in it, categorized by subject (her friend can use that for card making and scrapbooking).  She is trying to arrange a teen soccer club for next year. She likes reading classic books, and spends time learning Spanish, although not as passionately as a few years ago. As for curriculum, she told me she would like to do consumer math next year...we have that on the shelf==<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds to me like she is doing a lot. I&#39;m not sure why she needs a consumer math curriculum. Wouldn&#39;t she learn that just by being a consumer?<br/>\n<br/>\n== I am stuck on credits, how to call a quote book &quot;English&quot; on a transcript, and getting into college, even though she hasn&#39;t expressed a need for college after grade 12. I feel like they have to count their hours to make up enough credits for geography or spanish.  How can I make a transcript if they haven&#39;t spent enough time on it to be a credit? ==<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you sure they need a transcript like that to go to college? It&#39;s been a long time since I applied to a 4-year college and things have changed a lot. I don&#39;t remember ever hearing about homeschooling and homeschoolers back then. Now there are lots of homeschoolers going to college and many colleges are accepting alternative application information. If they attend community college they may not need transcripts at all. My son took some community college classes this past year and all he had to do was take placement tests. I wonder if the transcripts are to show credit or just to show that the person has graduated from high school?

It helps to have some perspective.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI did locate Grace Llewelyn&#39;s book (more recent one) at the public library.  It never occurred to me that they would carry it, although I have looked for homeschooling books there often. I&#39;m looking forward to it.  I have read a bit of John Holt...Teach Your Own, and How Children Learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize I have a long way to go regarding the mental switch from homeschool to unschool.  Sandra, you did not comment on why you agreed that homeschool to unschool was more difficult than a switch from public school to unschool.  I thought about it since, and think it&#39;s because public school to homeschool you think you can do better than them.  Homeschool to unschool feels like you won&#39;t be doing enough, or as well as the public schools.  Does that make sense?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for my sign language daughter, she is the graduated one, and is working in a daycare full-time, and will be volunteering at a camp where deaf children will attend for one week this summer.  Another week she will be at sign language immersion camp.  I am not worried about her.  She arranged all this on her own, seeking out a camp that would be in need of a signing staff member, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is the younger two who I am worried about.  (I&#39;ll just focus on the 17 yo)The 17 yo is not sure what she wants to do, and I think after all these years of using curriculum, she feels like she will be &quot;flailing&quot; without it.  She is interested in geography-not landforms and such...she likes to know the cultures and interesting facts about the people and places (I don&#39;t know how much she would delve into this, but has shown great interest in the past).  She would like to volunteer walking dogs.  She has been compiling a book for a friend that has quotes in it, categorized by subject (her friend can use that for card making and scrapbooking).  She is trying to arrange a teen soccer club for next year. She likes reading classic books, and spends time learning Spanish, although not as passionately as a few years ago. As for curriculum, she told me she would like to do consumer math next year...we have that on the shelf<br/>\n<br/>\n I guess this comes out sounding pretty well-rounded, but I am stuck on credits, how to call a quote book &quot;English&quot; on a transcript, and getting into college, even though she hasn&#39;t expressed a need for college after grade 12. I feel like they have to count their hours to make up enough credits for geography or spanish.  How can I make a transcript if they haven&#39;t spent enough time on it to be a credit? I think it&#39;s partly as parents, you want to give your child every opportunity to succeed in what they choose for their life, and I don&#39;t want to mess things up for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuggestions about unschoolers camps or retreats are not going to fly here.  We are not financially able to send them away this year. I don&#39;t even know if there are any unschoolers in my city.  There ought to be.

If I let them pursue their own interests now, (17 yo doesn&#39;t know what she wants to do yet)  they could learn and read about all kinds of things, but not delve into anything in depth enough to call it a course.  I think I am focusing on the transcript and getting into college, and that is what is getting to me.  Anyone out there start unschooling that late in the game, and how did you approach things with your teens?<br/>\n<br/>\nPS it is a much easier jump going from public school to homeschool than homeschool to unschool - at least that&#39;s my perception.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for the long post.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54897,"nextTopicId":54958}}
