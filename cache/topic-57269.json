Biologically. With dogs and<br/>\ncats, you can see the interplay within the different shades of order<br/>\namong them. Which THEY maintain. No need to do that externally. I<br/>\nthink the same is true of children. There&#39;s no need to maintain an<br/>\norder among because they all have their own ideas which will probably<br/>\nalways conflict with one another&#39;s and change at least somewhat over<br/>\ntime. It&#39;s an issue that influences me and Brian and Karl too even<br/>\nthough Karl is an only child since we parents are both middle<br/>\nchildren.. the ones picked most often to play the role of being in the<br/>\n&quot;wrong.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a male cat and a female cat who are about the same age. I think<br/>\nthe female is a bit older. I make sure to give them each lots of<br/>\nattention and pet and talk with them together, apart and with the dog<br/>\ntoo who, being a dachshund, is also their same size (they are a little<br/>\ntaller than Katie is ;). They get along very well, mainly I think<br/>\nbecause I know cats like tons of space especially from each other and<br/>\nthe male cat cuddles with the dog with much less tension than hugging<br/>\non a female cat who doesn&#39;t want to be messed with.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren have different preferences for closeness, space and things,<br/>\nsome to do with gender sometimes but mostly to do with how they<br/>\ninteract with others and think of themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy three sisters and I are all very different in a number of ways. It<br/>\nwould be tempting to say there&#39;s no hierarchy but it would be more<br/>\naccurate, I think, to say that we operate in our own spheres and have<br/>\ndifferent lives now.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember that while the children are young and before they go off on<br/>\ntheir own. Things will change over time if parents avoid getting<br/>\ninvolved in what the pecking order is.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, parents can help each child before then and avoid<br/>\nmaintaining artificial ideas about the roles they play for however<br/>\nlong the kids think they have to (I&#39;ve seen that many times over and I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary). Allow each child the room to be who they<br/>\nare as fully as possible. It might help, in a way, to think of each as<br/>\n&quot;only&quot; children, sort of, since each child is unique with different<br/>\nneeds from others. Don&#39;t think of children as generic beings in need<br/>\nof maintaining some fabled equality.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: &quot;Can I be first?&quot;","postDate":"1284477892","msgId":57293,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg1RUNFMjAzLURBRkItNDBDNC04OTBELTRGM0ExRTcwQzlBM0BTYW5kcmFEb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGk2bW4wbCtjb2J1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGk2bW4wbCtjb2J1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57287,"nextInTopic":57305,"prevInTime":57292,"nextInTime":57294,"topicId":57269,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=---- It s not because she s younger and smaller.

My older daughter Ashlin also often wants to be first in the car etc, very similar to what you described. It is usually fine because she is more capable of going first. Often she has initiated the activity and so naturally wants to go first. If her younger sister Eden has initiated something, then I default to Eden going first.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think is is pretty natural for there to be a certain level of competition between siblings, but it sounds like you are catering well for both children&#39;s needs, so I don&#39;t think the older child wanting to go first is necessarily something to be concerned about.<br/>\n<br/>\nClaire<br/>\nMelbourne, Australia<br/>\nKids - Ashlin, 5 & Eden, 3</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;Can I be first?&quot;","postDate":"1284353399","msgId":57270,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNGM0U5ODFGLTI3ODAtNEE5Ri1BQ0VDLTY0MzY3MTJDMjEzMkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGk2anZqOStsaWpsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGk2anZqOStsaWpsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57269,"nextInTopic":57271,"prevInTime":57269,"nextInTime":57271,"topicId":57269,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- and as far as I know, isn t needing or wanting for anything.-=- He s needing to be first.

I can&#39;t figure out what is missing from his life that makes him feel the need to be first at everything.  He is greatly loved, gets a lot of attention, and as far as I know, isn&#39;t needing or wanting for anything.
