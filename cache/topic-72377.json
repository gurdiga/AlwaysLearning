When movies agreed, it meant that idea was *possibly* true. When they disagreed, it became an intriguing question of which idea, if either, was right. And because the movies were clearly not a reliable resource, it meant anything might be discovered to be wrong. That&#39;s fun and exciting :-)</div><div><br></div>A few years ago before Carl, Kat and I visited England, I revisited a lot of the old &quot;historical&quot; movies I&#39;d watched as kid. Obviously&nbsp;many of them were full of inaccuracies and anomalies. It was surprising how much Kathryn questioned as accurate even&nbsp;though she hadn&#39;t had nearly as much exposure to those periods as I had.<br><br>And even though my interest was high but casual it was surprisingly&nbsp;easy to figure out what parts of The Vikings (with Kirk Douglas) were accurate and what parts were off. The Viking village had&nbsp;a real feel to it, with the ponies and houses (and the director and Douglas had spent a year researching with help from&nbsp;Norwegian museums), but the English castle felt wrong (turns out if was a French fort from a century later) and the small&nbsp;stained glass window practically jumped out from the screen and said &quot;WRONG!&quot; ;-) But I was never told any of that&nbsp;information. I absorbed it, filtered it, questioned it and built up what is apparently a pretty decent foundation.<br><br><div>Could I pass the AP European History test? No. But that&#39;s not the purpose of learning through unschooling. The purpose is supplying a rich environment for the the child building a head full of ideas and connections she finds intriguing from. If a child discovers connections between a new idea and ideas she&#39;s already intrigued by, the new ideas get sucked in. The more interesting ideas someone has, the more ideas they&#39;ll pull in. The more ideas they have, the more connections they&#39;ll see between vastly different ideas.</div><div><br></div><div>And it doesn&#39;t matter whether the ideas are deemed important by experts or not.
