I could be wrong, but if your kid are thinking in ANY way that those classes are the reason they&#39;re learning, and those things couldn&#39;t have been gathered other ways, that could be a problem. ---<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat Sandra wrote above made me recall some stuff from the beginning of when I was learning about unschooling.  I think it might be helpful, for others, to write about it.  When I first came across Sandra&#39;s website, I was very engrossed with it.  I think I sent a private email to Sandra with some questions, and then she directed me to this list for the continued discussion about those questions.  In any case, I was very quickly drawn in, and the serious reading began.  I joined several unschooling yahoo lists... and between those and the various website resources, I could have spent hours reading each day.  And it became overwhelming to hold all of this new information in my head, and the result was that I lost sight of how to practice what I was reading, and lost sight of my own kid at times.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I didn&#39;t do the &#39;read a little&#39; part so well.  I read a lot (thats my nature).  After a while, I realized that my relationship with Temima, then 2 or 3, was suffering because of the time I was spending engrossed with the reading.  And I was getting fustrated because I couldn&#39;t do what I was reading... but also she was fustrated because I wouldn&#39;t be with her more of our time.  And after a short while, I realized I should read less.  So I decided which lists I thought were the most helpful (this one won out!!  Unschooling Basics was alright, but didn&#39;t work for me), and I stopped reading the others.  I unsigned from those a bit later.  And then I stopped even reading every thread on this list.  These days, I read something if it&#39;s title catches my eye.   <br/>\n<br/>\nFor a while after that, I didn&#39;t read much at all.  I just focused on my time with Temima.  I found myself creating answers in my head to my questions (right or wrong) based on what I thought the list might answer those questions.  That was helpful, when it was helpful.  Sometimes I didn&#39;t come up with great stuff... but it helped me to problem solve on my own for a while.   So this was the first &#39;try a little&#39; phase... and I saw big changes.  It was great.  I continued to NOT read this list or other resources after that, letting the nice changes in our relationship sink in and find patterns.  I guess that was the first &#39;wait a while.&#39;   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd while I was waiting a while, I slowed down (in my mind) a bit, and I think that was the first &#39;watch&#39; period.  Instead of just doing, and developing our relationship and my skills, I actively watched, sought out patterns and emotions and things I can&#39;t even describe.  I guess I&#39;d compare it to watching your husband or baby sleep, getting to know the little sounds and movements (or big snores).  I watched the nuances of our relationship, in our day-to-day lives, and tweaked what was already working pretty well.  While I was watching, I got to know my daughter better, and because of that, I could see where I wasn&#39;t doing my best...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so I&#39;d go back and read a little, post a question here, follow the links to Sandra&#39;s a Joy&#39;s pages, etc.  &#39;Read a little.&#39;  And then I&#39;d try out what I&#39;d read, &#39;try a little,&#39; &#39;wait a while&#39; and &#39;watch.&#39;   Repeat, repeat, repeat.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now its sort of something that just happens.  The waiting and watching have grown, the try a little has slowed down, the read a little has found its place (research into specific difficulties, rather than endless browsing of anything I can find). <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in case anyone is curious about how that process might look... that&#39;s how its gone for me so far.   <br/>\n<br/>\nShira Rocklin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59286,"nextTopicId":59330}}
