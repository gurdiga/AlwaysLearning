Wow talk about relevant...I just today, for the 1st time encouraged my 10 yr old dd, to ride her bike to get a sub she was craving. The store is only two blocks away, but she had never gone alone before. I had always just walked with her or we&#39;d ride up together...today she asked, more as a convenience to me,if she could go on her own( I&#39;m packing for us to head out on a trip tomorrow). She was back in a flash, with out insident, but she said some people where looking at her weird in the shop...and it got us talking about how we should handle it, if she was actually approached, or just questioned about being on her own!   I like the note card idea, she caries a state id in her wallet.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElisabeth mama to Liv(10) and Lex(7)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223130287,"authorName":"Krisula Moyer","from":"Krisula Moyer &lt;krisula@...&gt;","profile":"krisulaula","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re:Student ID cards","postDate":"1240539028","msgId":44258,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyRTBFMDI2LTQ3MTItNDQwOC04OEVELUM2MEQ1NEVERkUyNUBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":44256,"nextInTopic":44264,"prevInTime":44257,"nextInTime":44259,"topicId":44245,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We have them and I like that my teens have them when they are out and about without me but the only time they ve showed them to anyone was to get a student","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2015411786\">We have them and I like that my teens have them when they are out and  <br/>\nabout without me but the only time they&#39;ve showed them to anyone was  <br/>\nto get a student discount somewhere.
