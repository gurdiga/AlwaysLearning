She said &quot;I bet <br/>\nKeith misses having tongue.&quot;  I didn&#39;t say &quot;I bet he does NOT.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI said as neutrally and politely as I could that I wasn&#39;t going to eat any <br/>\nand she said with a kind of laugh in her voice (which she has at the very <br/>\nworst times) &quot;Yes you will.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne time she had a little raisin dessert in a very small bowl, a little like <br/>\nbread pudding, but mostly raisins.  Maybe oatmeal base.  And very small <br/>\nhelpings.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMarty, who was three or four, didn&#39;t like one of vegetables, or whatever.  <br/>\nShe told him if he didn&#39;t eat it he couldn&#39;t have dessert.  I looked at him <br/>\nand saw his face (we never do dessert, but she was depriving him as a <br/>\npunishment, he knew that much), and I said &quot;Marty, you can have mine!&quot;  all <br/>\nhappy.  Then Marty was happy.  I didn&#39;t even glance at the grandma, at my <br/>\nleft, who was probably not happy, but hey--I had earned MY dessert, and could <br/>\ndo with it as I wished with my OWN child, and the worst she could have done <br/>\nwould have been to tell us to go home.  That would have been better than <br/>\ndessert.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma *","from":"&quot;zenmomma *&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] the mil from hell?","postDate":"1009456970","msgId":1578,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxMzNHZExPRnhiUVJ4aWRXdkowMDAwZmY3NUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":1596,"prevInTime":1577,"nextInTime":1579,"topicId":1578,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
