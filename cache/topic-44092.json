Chats live within the space of those moments of real time <br/>\nthat they&#39;re taking place in.  The kinds of questions to clarify things <br/>\nand communicate on lists are extremely valuable and also very different <br/>\nfrom the kinds of things said to connect and converse during chats.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf at all possible even for just a few moments, for those who like to <br/>\ntalk that is, I think chats from unschooler to unschooler can be direct <br/>\nways to increase our ability to connect with our children, our <br/>\nfamilies, and other people as well as other unschoolers.  Unschooling <br/>\nchats are frequently interspersed with comments about how to connect <br/>\nmore deeply and authentically with our children, how to take up the <br/>\nopportunities we have to embrace the moments and not allow the moments <br/>\nwith others to slip away.  They have been very inspirational to me and <br/>\nenlarged my appreciation and heart of gratitude.  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/chat\">http://sandradodd.com/chat</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s very easy for me to feel deprived of time to myself, and really it <br/>\nhasn&#39;t been an epiphany for me but I&#39;ve discovered that it&#39;s a gradual <br/>\ngrowing, a living and breathing give and take and back and forth kind <br/>\nof thing, depending on how I behave and feel.  Time is made up of many <br/>\nmore opportunities to connect and to take breaks for ourselves than we <br/>\nrealize when we think in moments instead of those bigger chunks of time <br/>\n(hours, days).  If we store up both connection moments and (not <br/>\ndisconnection but) alone moments then we don&#39;t feel as deprived of <br/>\ntime.  Really it&#39;s very like not feeling deprived of food, love, or <br/>\nanything else.  When we ration time and separate things up and dole out <br/>\ntime with no feeling of the generosity of all the time of our lives <br/>\ntogether, time feels conflicted.  When we say yes to more time for our <br/>\nchildren and for ourselves, so that we and our children have all the <br/>\ntime we need, then we are less conflicted about time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were talking briefly elsewhere in other threads about instinct... <br/>\nthat humans haven&#39;t overcome or outgrown instinct.  And rather than <br/>\nignore or deny instinct, we could accommodate for instinctive behavior <br/>\nand thereby raise the level of peace in our lives.  If we need more <br/>\nconnection and more solitude than we feel we have, it&#39;s great to really <br/>\n*see* it more simply by looking at moments.  We might feel that just <br/>\nbecause humans can see time by the clock and look over the millions of <br/>\nyears of existence that have passed long ages ago, we could surely <br/>\novercome our instinctive need to live in the moment.  But I think it&#39;s <br/>\nbetter to realize that our bodies feel differently than logic might <br/>\nlead us to believe, and make changes for peace and happiness.  It&#39;s not <br/>\nstupid or illogical to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Connection and Anger","postDate":"1240150334","msgId":44158,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZFRTlDQzE0LTA5OTgtNEE4Ri05QTAyLUM5RTZFQjAwMDRBMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDg3MDg5Ljg2ODQucW1Ad2ViODYyMDYubWFpbC5pcmQueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdzOHJlMCtxb2xpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MDA1NTAxYzljMDk3JDY4YjUzMmYwJDNhMWY5OGQwJEBjb20+IDw4NzA4OS44Njg0LnFtQHdlYjg2MjA2Lm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":44157,"nextInTopic":44159,"prevInTime":44157,"nextInTime":44159,"topicId":44092,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- have a cup of tea in a favorite mug, make candy (I did that for the first time yesterday, I can now make traditional British candy so if there isn t a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-387350792\">-=- have a cup of tea in a favorite mug, make candy (I did that for  <br/>\nthe first time yesterday, I can now make traditional British candy so  <br/>\nif there isn&#39;t a penny candy place that I can find for you Sandra I  <br/>\ncan make you stuff and you can give me pence for it, or not. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOh huh!

Things like having a beautiful glass to drink from, or a song that I really like to dance to, or finding a dead mole while walking the dog and looking a the way it&#39;s front paws arc out, clearly being used for digging more than for walking, or discovering that there is a website on flotsam (www.flostametrics.com), or finding an Edith Blyton mystery puzzle at a charity shop in Diss (I scoped them out Sandra, there are quite a few with puzzles and one with a troll plate that I&#39;m going back for) for 1 pound. The little things, the little moments of pleasure refill my mood gauge. It takes looking for them. Moving with an eye for pleasure. If I&#39;m standing in the kitchen doing the dishes I enjoy the bubbles on the water or the plates that we got from Habitat or the one red glass that I got when it was marked down at Waitrose or the much cheaper on I got when I spotted it at Morrison&#39;s because it<br/>\n reminds me of Target&#39;s logo with its embossed bullseyes. And I listen to the other things going on in the house: Simon and Linnaea negotiating their way through a game or laughing at something they found on lol cats and calling me in to share it or David coming in and chatting with me about the costs of renting a cottage in Norway versus one in France with a pool or playing a song on Rock Band that I haven&#39;t heard in a long, long time. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of other ways that I can find of enjoying something. It is very much recognizing that it is this moment, not the whole day, not the whole hour, but this moment that is the important one. And once it&#39;s gone it&#39;s the next moment that counts. When I start feeling overwhelmed or grouchy or tired or lousy it&#39;s important to recognize that and do the things that change how I feel. Eat, or sit and watch a movie, or take a nap, or go to bed earlier or go for a walk when David gets home, pet the cats or play with the dog, have a cup of tea in a favorite mug, make candy (I did that for the first time yesterday, I can now make traditional British candy so if there isn&#39;t a penny candy place that I can find for you Sandra I can make you stuff and you can give me pence for it, or not.

I don&#39;t have a solution on this.  I just want to let  <br/>\nyou know I have been working on the same issue lately.  When someone  <br/>\nwas talking about benign neglect in this group it really touched me  <br/>\nbecause it feels like sometimes that is all I have to offer.  To  <br/>\nconnect deeply for an entire day is intense and tiring for me.  When I  <br/>\nwas a child teachers called me a &quot;daydreamer.&quot;  I was the kid in the  <br/>\nback twisting her hair and gazing out the window.  Always in trouble  <br/>\nfor not being mentally in the room with the other kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if I have what we would call today an auditory processing  <br/>\nissue.  When people speak to me I have learned to wait for the words  <br/>\nto crowd around in my head and then line up and make sense.  This  <br/>\nprocess is experienced by me as trying to decode the message.  Others  <br/>\nexperience it as a blank stare or stupidity or worst of all- me  <br/>\nignoring them.  I experience sadness when my daughter gets frustrated  <br/>\nwith this.  And she gets so frustrated.  She keeps elaborating on what  <br/>\nshe said- adding more words for my poor brain to process.  I get brain  <br/>\nlock and feel like I have to re-boot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve noticed that after a day of fully connecting I just want to veg.  <br/>\nI want to read or just lie with my eyes closed, or have my daughter  <br/>\nplay with someone else for awhile.  And I get cranky and tired.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeditation and mindfulness are helping so far in identifying what is  <br/>\nhappening.  I&#39;ll let you know when the solution begins to bubble up.   <br/>\nSo far, being mindful helps me to be more compassionate with my  <br/>\ndaughter and myself.  I want to be able to be close and to endure the  <br/>\nintensity of joy and love.  I want my daughter to feel every day just  <br/>\nhow much I love her.  So I need to patient with both of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus one of the reasons I took my daughter out of school is that her  <br/>\nkinder teacher placed her at the table with the other &quot;cadets&quot; as she  <br/>\nput it.  I didn&#39;t like that the kids were being divided up that way.   <br/>\nI saw all the &quot;smart&quot; kids at another table.  I saw the writing on the  <br/>\nwall.  I know my daughter is bright, but she does &quot;think different&quot;  <br/>\nand I wanted her to have the experience of having that embraced.  One  <br/>\nway I can help her love her self is to embrace the way I think and  <br/>\nfeel and make it work for me so that she has a model to follow.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Connection and Anger","postDate":"1239963077","msgId":44107,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExMUJGODMxLUIzNkEtNEEwMi1CNjJDLTkzRTJCMDYxNDgzQkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdzOHJlMCtxb2xpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdzOHJlMCtxb2xpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44104,"nextInTopic":44119,"prevInTime":44106,"nextInTime":44108,"topicId":44092,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
