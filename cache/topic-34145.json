We were always told that if we were honest<br/>\nwhen we screwed up, they could help us &quot;fix it&quot; rather than have to<br/>\nlie or hide the problem to make it worse.  I made pretty good<br/>\ndecisions (in my opinion &lt;BWG&gt;) as a teen.  Some bad fashion choices<br/>\nwere made and multiple ear piercings - but since none of it really got<br/>\na reaction from my parents, I felt no need to push any limits.  We had<br/>\nno curfews because my parents knew our friends - our friends had<br/>\ncurfews and we would be home at a reasonable hour as a result.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents have seen the tremendous grief we went through with the<br/>\npublic schools and the difficulties of parenting a child with Tourette<br/>\nSyndrome and OCD.  They have seen the &quot;miracles&quot; wrought by a<br/>\ntransition to homeschooling and then unschooling.  They have learned<br/>\nto accept their grandchildren exactly as they are and trusted us to<br/>\nparent them well.  I have learned to accept my parents for how they<br/>\n*do* love us rather than how I *expect* them to.  My father spent<br/>\nhours helping my husband rewire our barn and run an outlet to our<br/>\npool.  He comes to the rescue when our van breaks down or our pool<br/>\nfilter stops.  He may never sit and read a story to my kids or wrestle<br/>\nwith them on the floor.  But he did help my British husband (never<br/>\nplayed baseball in his life) coach little league baseball with his (my<br/>\ndad&#39;s) arm in a sling from shoulder surgery. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I could go on - life was not always perfect growing up.  My<br/>\nmom and I have not always been the best of friends - far from it at<br/>\ntimes.  BUT I do have some good examples to bring forward into<br/>\nparenting....<br/>\n<br/>\nJust wanted to share,<br/>\nDonna</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34134,"nextTopicId":34149}}
