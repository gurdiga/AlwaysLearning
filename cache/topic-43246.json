One thing that I learned on here and try to do whenever possible is think about how I would react in a similiar situation with another adult. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor example if i had bought concert tickets for dh and I and he wasn&#39;t feeling well and didnt want to go. I call a friend and offer last minute tickets and snuggle up in bed to watch netflix with him. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are having a hard time right now and looking at dh getting laid off soon so I understand the feeling of wasting but there are so many diff ways of looking at money. The money was spent out of love wether he went to the class or not.
