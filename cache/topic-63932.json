She&#39;s mainly into the Mario games, <br/>\nwhich  have a lot of different types of games.  She watches a lot of videos <br/>\nof people playing on utube and discovers games she&#39;d like to play that way. <br/>\nShe also likes games such as Sports Resort.  There are also Barbie games <br/>\nthat she really enjoys.  She is only just getting the hang of playing these <br/>\ngames by herself, and finds some of them quite hard past the beginning <br/>\nlevels, but I wouldn&#39;t necessarily say that all kids would, as so many seem <br/>\nto play them with no troubles.  Luckily, my husband and I are really <br/>\nenjoying playing them too, so we often all play together.  Many of them have <br/>\ncooperative mode, great for when you have more than one child or for a <br/>\nparent to help out.  She&#39;s also enjoyed watching my husband play through the <br/>\nlego games (Star Wars and Indiana Jones, though she doesn&#39;t want to watch <br/>\nthe movies, she enjoys the games).<br/>\n<br/>\nShe also has an iPad, and enjoys a lot of games on there.  She can play <br/>\nthese mostly by herself, and it has the big advantage of being portable! <br/>\nSome games she&#39;s enjoyed is the Angry Birds series, Dora games (these are <br/>\nmore simple, more interactive story books), and a lot of the building style <br/>\ngames.  Right now she&#39;s enjoying Pet Hotel.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also have a playstation.  The older one (ps2) has a lot of games she <br/>\nenjoys, such as Dora, and her favourite is Spyro.  This was where she <br/>\nstarted on playing on consoles.  You can get a lot of good kids games second <br/>\nhand, so if budget is tight, it&#39;s not a bad place to start.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Christmas, we&#39;ve asked the IL&#39;s to buy her a Nintendo 3DS (they asked <br/>\nwhat she would like), as it&#39;s a bit out of our budget right now.  From <br/>\nlooking around, there is a good range of kids games, and a lot of them are <br/>\ncheaper than games for the Wii.

I suggest getting one! They are marked down right now for the holidays. All Mario games are fun for both boys and girls. I also suggest the Kirby games! We also enjoy/enjoyed the Sims Pets, Wii Sports, Wipeout the game, Shrek, and all of the Nintendogs/Cats games. There are so many great games specifically tailored to girls. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I like to do is go to a Gamestop store and ask questions about games. Most of the people that work at the shops are very knowledgable about all games. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the computer, we have both PC and Mac (a lot of games are offered for both now!) and Xander loved the Kid Pix software.

Then recently I heard about Roblox which looks like 7 and over. G5 likes playing all the little games in Zoodles on my Mac, and G5 & G3 are consummate iPad users - they taught themselves how to do everything. G5 asks to purchase new iPad games all the time and lately I&#39;ve noted an up-tick in her ability to handle more complicated stuff. She had me purchase Cut The Rope and has worked through 4 boxes in 2 days. G3 tries to copy everything she does and does pretty well herself too on the creative/drawing games. G5 is also extremely social. Friends with everyone on block irregardless of age, and sends video emails to my parents daily.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause they don&#39;t read though, they can&#39;t find new games on the computer.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas for good games for her we can try together?
