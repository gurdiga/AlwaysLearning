I didn&#39;t see Karl roll over once. (I wasn&#39;t looking for<br/>\nit either but if I had, it might have worried me some.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think rolling over is a stage but something the majority of<br/>\nbabies do of their own accord. So much so that it&#39;s in baby books with<br/>\na date line for the mother to record the details if she wants to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying there ARE no stages. I&#39;m just saying that not<br/>\neverything is necessarily a stage just because many babies do<br/>\nsomething.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 6/28/10, Jenny Cyphers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jenstarc4@...\">jenstarc4@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; ***I am wondering what you mean by not putting an infant into a situation<br/>\n&gt; where they can be frustrated and fail.

Frustration is an<br/>\n&gt; inevitable part of life, it will happen at some point that a child is<br/>\n&gt; frustrated and there may be little a parent can do to change things, other<br/>\n&gt; than being there and being kind and sympathetic.  So, anytime a parent can<br/>\n&gt; avoid frustrating a kid, that seems like a positive good thing!  When my<br/>\n&gt; babies struggled to do things, I didn&#39;t sit there and watch them struggle, I<br/>\n&gt; helped them, either by handing them the thing they wanted, or sitting them<br/>\n&gt; up to see, or rolling them over, or picking them up to be held and loved up.<br/>\n&gt;  It&#39;s not as if infants need to be trained to roll over.
