We do know that stress, prolonged or short<br/>\nterm stimulates anxiety responses. We do know that<br/>\nthis creates acclerated wear and tear on the indocrin<br/>\nand nervous, and circulatory, and digestive, and skin,<br/>\nand spirit,and, well, one&#39;s entire self.  We do know<br/>\nthat prolonged physical and emotional pain uses up<br/>\nseratonin, too. And that pain is the result of<br/>\naccelerated wear and tear and the result of the world<br/>\nnot being the way we want it.  Too much of this pain<br/>\nand stress and too much seartonin get used up.  Then<br/>\nthere isn&#39;t enough of this chemical in our brains to<br/>\nget us through the daily business of living.  So a<br/>\nseratinin reuptake inhibitor is sometimes tried, to<br/>\nhelp out.  It is usually started at low doses.  It<br/>\nalso takes a while for the sesartonin to build back up<br/>\nin one&#39;s system. Weeks, with meds. Sometimes never,<br/>\nwithout meds. Sometimes the continued stresses are too<br/>\nmuch, and more med. is needed (usually). <br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t help everyone, and some folks have<br/>\nreactions to it. (That is why it is started with such<br/>\nlow doses). Some people do OK with other<br/>\nantidepressants. Some don&#39;t. Thank the Powers that Be<br/>\nthat there is help for some.<br/>\n<br/>\nDepression (seratonin deficiancy)is a serious problem<br/>\ncausing other serious problems and even death, not<br/>\nalways only of the depressed person. It should always<br/>\nbe taken seriously. No matter what the causes. If<br/>\nProzac helps or other medsgo for it! St John&#39;s wart<br/>\nmay be enough for some, chocolate, enough for others. <br/>\nA good joke, prayers and hugs may tide some<br/>\nover....but not everyone. Whatever helps should be<br/>\ndone.
