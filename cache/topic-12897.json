That might be<br/>\n&gt; Laura. Then twenty-five other family and friends. There are no survivors.<br/>\n&gt; Now imagine some other way to do it. Quadruple the inspectors, or put<br/>\n&gt; a thousand and one U.N. people in. Then call for peace activists to<br/>\n&gt; volunteer to go to Iraq for two weeks each. Flood that country with well<br/>\n&gt; meaning tourists, people curious about the land that produced the great<br/>\n&gt; saints, Gilani, Hallaj, and Rabia. Set up hostels near those tombs.<br/>\n&gt; Encourage peace people to spend a bunch of money in shops, to bring<br/>\n&gt; rugs home and samovars by the bushel. Send an Arabic translator with<br/>\n&gt; every four peace activists.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The U.S. government will pay for the translators and for building and<br/>\n&gt; staffing the hostels, one hostel for every twenty activists and five<br/>\n&gt; translators. The hostels are state of the art,  and they belong to the<br/>\n&gt; Iraqis at the end of this experiment.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jimmy Carter, Nelson Mandela, and my friend,  Jonathan Granoff at the<br/>\n&gt; U.N.,will be the core organization team. No one knows what might<br/>\n&gt; come of this. Maybe nothing, or maybe it would convince some Iraqis<br/>\n&gt; and some of the world that we really do not wish to kill anybody, and<br/>\n&gt; that we truly are not out to appropriate oil reserves. We&#39;re working on<br/>\n&gt; building a hydrogen vehicle as fast as we can, aren&#39;t we? Put no limit on<br/>\n&gt; the number of activists from all over who might want to hang out and<br/>\n&gt; explore Iraq for two weeks. And get college credit There could be<br/>\n&gt; informal courses for pick up soccer games every evening at five. Long<br/>\n&gt; leisurely suppers. The U. S. government furnishes air transportation,<br/>\n&gt; that is, hires airliners from the country of origin and back for each<br/>\n </span></blockquote>peace<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; tourist, who must carry and spend the equivalent of $1001 US inside<br/>\n&gt; Iraq. Keep part of the invasion force nearby as police, but let those who<br/>\n&gt; claim to deeply detest war try something else just this once, for one<br/>\n&gt; year. Call our bluff. If this mad man Saddam&#39;s WMD threat is not,<br/>\n&gt; somehow, eliminated by next February, you can go in with special ops,<br/>\n&gt; and do it that way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Medical services, transportation inside Iraq, lots of big colorful buses -<br/>\n&gt; let the pilgrims paint them! - along with many other ideas that will be<br/>\n&gt; thought of later during the course of this innocently, blatantly, foolish<br/>\n&gt; project will all also be funded by the U.S. government.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s a practice known as sama, a deep listening to poetry and<br/>\n&gt; music, with movement sometimes involved. We could experiment with<br/>\n&gt; whole nights of that, staying up until dawn, sleeping in tents during the<br/>\n&gt; day. So instead of war there&#39;s a peace period from March 2003 through<br/>\n&gt; February 2004. It could be as though war had already happened, as it<br/>\n&gt; has, and the healing and rebuilding.
