One has to do with food.  I used to <br/>\nstress out over the fact that my 4 year old woke up practically begging <br/>\nfor sweets.  I finally gave up the notion that he had to have a certain <br/>\nkind of food for breakfast ... and gave him the ice-cream he wanted, <br/>\nwith a side of candy corn.  Know what happened?  He ate much more <br/>\nhealthfully during the day than he normally does.  Seems he just likes <br/>\na burst of sugar in the AM ... so do I!  And regarding food, Sandra, I <br/>\nLOVE your Monkey Platter idea.  My kids think that is just the best <br/>\ntreat!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs we were in the car the other day, my 7 year old asked why the truck <br/>\nin front of us was carrying nitrogen.  When I asked how he know what <br/>\nwas in the tank, he said, &quot;because I read it.&quot;  Oh!  This same child, <br/>\nasked how long it would take to get to our destination.  When I told <br/>\nhim 10 minutes, he calculated the time of our arrival, taking into <br/>\nconsideration that our clock is 5 minutes fast.  I couldn&#39;t help <br/>\nflashing to my school days ... how annoying would that be as a word <br/>\nproblem?  I love that for my son, these are things he arrived at <br/>\nnaturally.  No one had to coach him how to figure things out - he just <br/>\ndid it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this moment of sharing is okay.
