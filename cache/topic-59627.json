Our children are 4 and 6 and we&#39;ve been playing for a couple of years already. We keep the mood light and playful and we laugh a lot by inventing crazy &#39;emergency&#39; stories that we have to escape from. One of us just starts the game when we feel like playing it and most often it&#39;s the children. Most of the time we play at home, but sometimes it&#39;s when we&#39;re waiting in line, walking in the woods, on a train trip, or on a bike ride.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome examples are we physically act out &#39;stop, drop and roll&#39;. We pretend to be doing something (dancing, cooking, reading a book) and then one of us yells, &quot;oh no, we&#39;re on fire!&quot;. And then we dramatically freeze, drop to the ground and start rolling around.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother one is one of us pretends to be a stranger in a car and says something like &#39;Excuse me little girl, I&#39;ve lost my bunny rabbit and I was wondering if you could help me find her. Then we can have some candy afterwards&#39;. Then we yell &#39;No Way!&#39; as loud as we can and run away and tell a trusted adult. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe reenact fairy tales such as Snow White and come up with different things that Snow White could have said to the old woman who offered her the apple. Or what could Spiderman have done differently to not have been captured by Kingpin.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe yell out, &#39;Oh no, there&#39;s a Grizzly bear and I&#39;m all alone in the woods&#39;. Or &#39;I&#39;m Scuba Diving and now there&#39;s a shark coming towards me&#39;. Or &#39;Our car is stuck in the snow and there&#39;s a blizzard outside!&#39;. Or &#39;There&#39;s a flying two headed dragon coming right for us and it looks hungry!&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey don&#39;t get scared or have bad dreams. We&#39;re all really relaxed and playful and it&#39;s done in the spirit of fun. They love being able to shout &#39;No!&#39; as loud as they can. They love creating interesting doomsday scenarios and waiting for us to come up with solutions. They are rarely without us in real life and feel safe. If one of our children were sensitive about it, we would stop playing these sorts of games. But on most days our children dress up as different superheros, draw superheros, watch them on television/youtube/movies/children&#39;s theater, write letters to them, etc.. The &#39;Emergency&#39; games are just an extended part of that fun stuff for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I have chosen not to &#39;drill&#39; anything into them, so sometimes we have funny answers to the emergency plans that are completely the wrong thing to do. We suggest a better solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nMe: The tidal wave is coming, what should we do? Daughter (4): Jump in the water!!! Son (6): No, No, No! Run for higher ground!<br/>\n<br/>\nor<br/>\n<br/>\nDaughter (4): The house is on fire, what should we do? Son (6): Stop, drop and roll! Me: Ummm, not exactly. We get out of the house as fast as possible. We only stop, drop and roll when something on our body is on fire. Son: Got it!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one time my son was there when I had to call the ambulance, he was 5 and he was great at following my instructions - he ran to get the telephone, he ran downstairs to let the ambulance know where our house was, and he alerted our neighbours so they could take care of him while I went with my daughter to the hospital (febrile seizure).

We also make sure he has a cell phone on him at<br/>\nall times that he&#39;s separate from us.  A prepaid cell phone is our best<br/>\nfriend around here.  His first one was a cheap throwaway and we just kept<br/>\nlike $10 worth of minutes on it at all times.  It allowed him to be more<br/>\nindependent as he got older.  Now he has a month to month no contract<br/>\nunlimited phone that he uses to contact his dad and all of his various<br/>\nfriends.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe move a lot, so the idea of memorizing our address kind of didn&#39;t work<br/>\nwith us.  Draven&#39;s cell phone has our address programed into it, and we also<br/>\nhave it posted on the fridge (with the list of numbers).  When he was<br/>\nyounger we would make a song out of our address and sing it on a regular<br/>\nbasis.  WeeSing and Play (I think it was that one) had a song in it, and<br/>\nwhere I can&#39;t remember the tune it was to it went like this.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy name is Johnathan Smith<br/>\nThis is my address.<br/>\n1234 Wee Sing Lane<br/>\nAny city USA<br/>\n<br/>\nI just looked it up and it&#39;s on this CD/Book set<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.weesing.com/single_product.cfm?product_id=7\">http://www.weesing.com/single_product.cfm?product_id=7</a><br/>\nIt&#39;s also in one of the movies.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also made jokes about dialing 911.  We would say &quot;What do you do in an<br/>\nemergency&quot; &quot;Dial 911&quot; &quot;But what&#39;s the number to 911&quot; &quot;911&quot; &quot;Yeah, but what<br/>\ndo I dial to get 911&quot; &quot;911&quot; etc.   Draven was the type of kid that<br/>\nunderstood that 911 wasn&#39;t a joke, but making jokes about it helped him<br/>\nremember what to dial.  From touring the fire station and police station<br/>\nwhen he was younger he knew quite a bit about the emergency system.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps!<br/>\n<br/>\nTina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: emergency preparedness","postDate":"1297363750","msgId":59639,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENEREJBRDMyLTE4OUYtNDEyMi1CMDhFLTU4RjFERDMyQ0QwOEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlqMHQ4bCtyY2VqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlqMHQ4bCtyY2VqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":59634,"nextInTopic":59640,"prevInTime":59638,"nextInTime":59640,"topicId":59627,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

And we&#39;ve also had fire safety talks and the &quot;stop-drop-and roll&quot; conversation, but that usually happens when we&#39;re camping.<br/>\n<br/>\nFire stations have open houses when you can go and check out the fire engines. The officers give tours and talk about fire safety.  You can call your local station and organize a tour too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we&#39;re out, my dd likes to know the names of streets, so learning our address was easy because we&#39;d talk about it. We&#39;re turning onto Ridge rd, soon we&#39;ll be on High St, then a left onto Our road.  There&#39;s Jen at # 5 and Frank at # 10.....<br/>\n<br/>\nShe learned phone numbers by dialing them.  Let your older child call dad from your phone or you from his. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve talked about 911 too. I just looked on YouTube, and there are a ton of 911 songs. Some look pretty silly.<br/>\n<br/>\n----Also, any suggestions on books/videos for learning about personal<br/>\nsafety/inappropriate touching, etc?

Way more information than was necessary for a five year old who is always with trusted adults.  Your being with them will keep them safe. And as they get older, and spend time away from you, these conversations have a place, but probably not the way you&#39;re thinking.  With us, they&#39;ve happened naturally.  &quot;No means no&quot; applies to lots of situations--just recently, we had to step in when my MIL was tickling Noor, who asked her to stop, but was laughing while she did it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBrie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":199652015,"authorName":"Joanna Horn","from":"Joanna Horn &lt;jjhorn@...&gt;","profile":"dazy_duke77","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"emergency preparedness","postDate":"1297315229","msgId":59627,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGltRHN6LXJId2lMSjhFQTE9dXZPdlBLVCs2X3V5T1ZORl9jaXJOT0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":59634,"prevInTime":59626,"nextInTime":59628,"topicId":59627,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"What is the best way for young kids to learn what to do in case of emergency, if they aren t in school?
