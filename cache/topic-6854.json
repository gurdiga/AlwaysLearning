Why are my kids so important to<br/>\nme?  I think these are things that I came to<br/>\nunconsciously as a child and I could never concieve of<br/>\nbeing any other way.  Certainly I could never be what<br/>\nmy parents were to me.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there is so much to be learned about people, genetics and why we<br/>\nare the way we are.  My father and his brother were severely beaten<br/>\nthroughout their childhood by an alcoholic father.  My uncle followed in<br/>\nhis dad&#39;s footsteps while my dad drank very little and swore off spanking<br/>\nafter doing it only once.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that nurture can have a huge impact on one&#39;s nature but the<br/>\nevidence on genetics seems pretty compelling.  Wouldn&#39;t it be great if we<br/>\ncould back up time and REraise a person in a loving unschool home to see<br/>\nwhat difference it made?<br/>\n<br/>\nKris<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
