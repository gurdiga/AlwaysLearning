If  he","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1873881622\">Storm is three and a half (end of October birthday) and I know there&#39;s the  <br/>\npossibility he&#39;s &quot;growing out of&quot; naps, but I&#39;m not sure how gradual that is. <br/>\nIf  he would skip a nap for a day when he was younger, it was *very* hard for <br/>\nhim to  get back into the routine of napping, now not so much. Often, he&#39;ll nap <br/>\nin the  car later than he would nap at home if we&#39;re out at nap time. At home <br/>\nI nap with  him 99% of the time, occasionally, I&#39;ll lay with him until he <br/>\nfalls asleep then  come downstairs. Very rarely, he isn&#39;t interested in napping <br/>\nand I&#39;m  exhausted, and I&#39;ll nap while he stays up. We don&#39;t even call it <br/>\nnapping, we  call it &quot;relax time&quot; or more often &quot;playing video games&quot;, since we <br/>\ntake our  handheld games (Gameboy DS) and play side by side lying down until one <br/>\nor both  of us is tired, then we usually leave one of them open and running <br/>\nfor Storm to  have light.<br/>\n <br/>\nToday, Storm took his Gameboy and went upstairs himself. In the 5 minutes  or <br/>\nso he was up there, while I was pondering this new development and gloating  <br/>\nto myself about how trust and freedom is the way to go, I was finishing up  <br/>\nsomething on the computer before I was going to head up with him. Well, just as  <br/>\nI was finishing, he came down and took my hand and asked me to come with him, <br/>\n took me upstairs and was showing me some of the things that were the same on <br/>\n2  Gameboy game boxes that were laid side-by-side on the bed. He started <br/>\nplaying  one of them and I ducked into the bathroom for a moment before I joined <br/>\nhim.  When I came back in, he was still standing beside the bed playing and <br/>\nafter  asking him to get up in the bed and he didn&#39;t respond, I figured he was <br/>\njust  concentrating, so I picked him up and laid him on the bed. (Okay, now I&#39;m <br/>\nseeing  that I shouldn&#39;t have done that.) He protested that he didn&#39;t want to <br/>\nsleep and  I said I had needed him out of the way to get into bed. He said he <br/>\nwanted to go  downstairs and I said that I loved playing video games with him <br/>\nand couldn&#39;t we  do that. He said no, he wanted to go downstairs. I said I was <br/>\ndisappointed and  that I had really wanted to play with him. He said he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to sleep. I  told him he didn&#39;t have to sleep, he could just play games <br/>\nnext to me. Storm is  often most adamant about avoiding lying down or getting <br/>\ncomfortable when he is  the most sleepy. He started to get off the bed and <br/>\nsaid he wanted to go  downstairs and I said firmly but gently, &quot;No, lay down <br/>\nhere with me for a while.  We&#39;ll go downstairs later.&quot; He reluctantly climbed <br/>\nback up beside me and lay  down, then whined a bit and I said he sounded kind of <br/>\nlike a doggy whining  and asked him if he&#39;d ever heard a dog whine. Then I <br/>\nplayed with him a bit,  pretending to be a dog snuffling at him and whining, then <br/>\na soft bark. After  about 5 minutes of him giggling and asking me to do it <br/>\nagain, he acted like a  doggy for a bit and then settled down to play his game. <br/>\nEventually, he fell  asleep and when he woke, he showed no signs of his <br/>\nearlier upset/disapointment  and even pretended to be a dog and curled up with me <br/>\nfor a while before he went  downstairs.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt seems like a happy ending, but I&#39;m unsure if rare occurrences like these  <br/>\nare going to affect how he feels about sleeping or his ability to listen to <br/>\nhis  body and know when he&#39;s tired. We&#39;ve tried repeatedly (at night, not  <br/>\nnaptime) to let him fall asleep wherever (downstairs), but he just doesn&#39;t  fall <br/>\nasleep. He&#39;s a very light sleeper and anything keeps him awake, so even all  the <br/>\nrest of the family being quiet around him and the t.v. so low it&#39;s barely  <br/>\nable to be heard keep him awake. Three to four hours past when he normally falls <br/>\n asleep, and at that point, he&#39;s been so horribly cranky and beside himself <br/>\nthat  we&#39;ve taken him up where he&#39;s fallen asleep within 5 minutes. So, I&#39;m <br/>\nfeeling  uncertain. I&#39;m not sure what else I could have done instead (besides not <br/>\npicking  him up and placing him on the bed-I&#39;ll remember that next time), and <br/>\nthis was  one of those days where it was clear he needed some rest. Truly, I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t care  if he fell asleep or just laid quietly for a while, but I was <br/>\npretty sure he  *would* fall asleep if he was quiet a bit.<br/>\n <br/>\nAm I still not trusting him enough and deciding what&#39;s best for him myself?  <br/>\nDo I just need some new techniques and ideas? Is an incident like this rare  <br/>\nenough that it doesn&#39;t matter? I&#39;m just not sure, but I&#39;d like some input.<br/>\n <br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nDe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************Get fantasy football with free live scoring.
