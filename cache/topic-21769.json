So thin ! <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m surprised at your anger.  Were you used to telling him when to eat and go <br/>\nto the bathroom, so it bothers you that he&#39;s not telling you when to tell him <br/>\nto, or not reporting to you so you can provide food or bathrooms?  <br/>\n************** No, not at all... It&#39;s because before we start unschooling, he knew without us asking him, when he was hungry or not, he was going to the bathroom alone, without saying anything. This is now we say &quot;yes&quot; for other things like tv, or pc or eating in front of tv, or all those little things that we were saying &quot;no&quot; before, he doesn&#39;t know anymore for his body. <br/>\nAnd I really think anger can&#39;t be control like this... And talking about it to all of you and to my friend at the phone helped me a lot. I feel a lot better with all the answers I had, and it helped me to stand back and see the topics with other eyes...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe he&#39;s getting old enough that he doesn&#39;t want your involvement so much <br/>\nanymore in whether he needs the toilet or not.  <br/>\n****************** I&#39;m not involved anymore... He knew before, and he doesn&#39;t know anymore...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if he&#39;s the only one who NEEDS to know, maybe it&#39;s none of your business.<br/>\n*************** Yes, it&#39;s what I try to say. I know for a long time it&#39;s not my business.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nLet him have more privacy, maybe.<br/>\n************** That&#39;s what we do now... The &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; came in the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you go to visit friends, maybe take some of the foods he likes best at <br/>\nhome<br/>\n************** The thing is for the moment, he almost doesn&#39;t like anything, even what he loved before... Honestly, if I want to take something he likes, I don&#39;t know what... He really doesn&#39;t eat by now... <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe he wants you to talk to him about what &quot;hungry&quot; feels like or what the <br/>\nvarious symptoms of needing the toilet might be before you get to the &quot;HAVE TO <br/>\nGO NOW!<br/>\n************************** Oh ! I didn&#39;t think about that... Because those topics were not problems for him before... He knew when he was hungry or need to go to the toilets without us need to ask him at all... This is what is disturbing me... He knew before, and now he doesn&#39;t anymore... Can he forget because of more freedom ? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo maybe Tom wants you to say &quot;If food doesn&#39;t look good, you&#39;re probably not <br/>\nhungry,&quot; or &quot;sometimes when people are really hungry their stomachs make <br/>\nlittle noises.&quot;<br/>\n********************** Yes..

So, I try to change how we live at home, with more freedom for Tom and Lilou. <br/>\nI was very happy, because here, things were going like some of you said, or like I read on articles. Tom can watch tv for long time, and going after, and doing other things. He&#39;s asking questions again, want to write things (normaly, he doesn&#39;t like it at all !). All those things he stopped one and a half year ago, because of pressure. He&#39;s enthusiastic again...<br/>\nHe&#39;s more &quot;zen&quot;, somewhere... <br/>\nBut, now, there&#39;s something really disturbing and worrying for me. Now, for everything, he says &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;. For everything ! He doesn&#39;t know if he&#39;s hungry, he doesn&#39;t know if he needs to go to the toilets, he doesn&#39;t know if he&#39;s thirsty, if he likes that or that. It&#39;s really worrying, because he doesn&#39;t eat anything, because he doesn&#39;t know... Now, it&#39;s since about two weeks he&#39;s like this. And he&#39;s not playing with us on this topic, because it&#39;s something which is really making us so, so angry ! Can&#39;t he feel what are his needs, for his own body ?? <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling about all the life is new for us, but it&#39;s something we can deeply feel, it&#39;s not just a new recipe, or something like this. We really feel it&#39;s something &quot;true&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n I feel so angry about that ! So angry... what happens ? Is it this new little more freedom which is disturbing him ? Does he test us and our new vison of life ?
