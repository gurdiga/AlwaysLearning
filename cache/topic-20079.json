They love their children dearly. They don&#39;t agree that <br/>\nthe pattern of coercion interferes with the child learning to love <br/>\nlife. And I really don&#39;t want my son to learn that the coercion that <br/>\nis being modelled is a way to interact with people, especially <br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n*******************************************************************************************************************************<br/>\nThanks for sharing Pat.  You reminded me of why I have had so much difficulty going to the park.  I have been fortunate in<br/>\nregard to the enrichment activities over all though.  Although, as my previous share mentioned the kids are getting to an age<br/>\nin which they are going to be in school full time and I suspect changes as well as time restrictions will develop.  I did choose<br/>\nquite consciously who I wanted to pursue friendships with and playdates with by the behavior of the children and the parents behavior.  I am fortunate the La Leche in my area was full of AP mom&#39;s.  I went to my first Attachment Parenting get together <br/>\ntonight.  Mark came with too.  I had such a wonderful time.  Much better time than I have had at any of the past three homeschooling park play dates.  The get together was a potluck too.  It just seemed to me that the parents were conscious, gentle involved, and intelligent and the children all got along together.  Probably because they were modeled a lifetime of respect and had<br/>\nno need to fight because they are coming from a place of security.  I found this group through yahoo groups and it was recommended to me from someone I met online through unschooling basics.  Anyway, I look forward to another park date and the group itself online seems to be very active.  Maybe there is an AP group in your nearby area.  Alex is at an age now where the enrichment classes usually do not involved parents within the enviroment so the choice of teacher for me is very important.  I becoe very stressed when I am near anyone who is threatening or screaming at a child.  Another thing I am very grateful for<br/>\nis Alex&#39;s sensei.  She is a wonderful person and he spends two 45 min. private sessions a week with her.  I think for me the priority<br/>\nis to have connections.  It&#39;s wonderful if they are peer group but if I can not find that I will find someone he can interact with through mentoring.  He chooses what he is interested in learning though.  Another idea is maybe setting up a playdate in an environment where a vocal/controlling parent may be less likely to act out.  Example being someplace like a science museum.  I think some people are at there absolute worse at the park and beach.  Sometimes there are once a month classes for the young at place like the Aquarium of the Paciific and the children can learn and interact and even if a lifetime bond is not made they still have some moments with peers.  Anyway, didn&#39;t mean to write a novel.  Sorry, for the length.<br/>\nKay<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163177263,"authorName":"denice","from":"&quot;denice&quot; &lt;denice@...&gt;","profile":"mrsjatz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Playmates for children","postDate":"1090892030","msgId":20185,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMmMwMWM0NzM3OSRjNWUwZDYyMCQ3OTA0MTBhY0B3aWZpN2Jlcmxpbj4=","referencesHeader":"PDFjNi4xYzRiMTQ4Ni4yZTM2ZDdlNUBhb2wuY29tPiA8NDEwNTk4OEEuNzAwMDEwNEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0PiA8MDAxODAxYzQ3MzZkJGFjMTdmZmUwJDc5MDQxMGFjQHdpZmk3YmVybGluPiA8NDEwNUIwQTIuNTAwMDkwOEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":20184,"nextInTopic":20186,"prevInTime":20184,"nextInTime":20186,"topicId":20079,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Elizabeth Hill wrote: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1430506201\">Elizabeth Hill wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;It gets pretty confusing, but pretty much no one thinks I&#39;m too thin or<br/>\ntoo conservative. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAh, yes!

I think it was a help for me to have attachment parenting friends to set an example for me.  Maybe in this group, you will have to BE the example, the &quot;exemplary&quot; parent?<br/>\n<br/>\nNursing my kid was my best tool for calming upsetting situations at that age.  Maybe if people in some areas feel more pressure to wean early they are going to fall back more on &quot;traditional&quot; parenting techniques?<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you hang in a little longer and see if you can spot the most patient moms in the bunch.  Then maybe cut them out of the herd and have one on one playdates with them?   Your parenting style can influence their&#39;s and maybe it will spread to the wider group.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt also occurs to me that (overall) parents who are on their second or third kid have more sense about what behavior to expect at what ages.  You *might* find some older and wiser mamas with trailing 3 year olds that would be pleasanter to be around.  (Sorry for the &quot;ageism&quot; but the parenting approached quoted above sound kind of ignorant to me.)   (Oh, if you are looking for more &quot;literate&quot; parents who are parenting &quot;by the book&quot; but using the newer books &lt;g&gt;, you might try story time at a bookstore or library, or hang out at parks in yuppie neighborhoods.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally hate the word &quot;disobedient&quot;.   I like &quot;cooperation&quot;, but my goal is never to extract &quot;obedience&quot; from the people around me.  You have my sympathy for having to be around people who are &quot;obedience training&quot; their kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy<br/>\n<br/>\nPS  I live in the leftist CA Bay Area.  Mostly we hate authoritarianism, so authoritarian parenting isn&#39;t widespread here.<br/>\n<br/>\n**<br/>\nThey don&#39;t agree that <br/>\nthe pattern of coercion interferes with the child learning to love **<br/>\n<br/>\nPPS   I am the least coercive parent of everyone that I know well.   And I don&#39;t agree that a tiny bit of coercion, like &quot;c&#39;mon get your shoes on&quot; or &quot;please come with me to the store I want an orange now&quot; are going to interfere with a child&#39;s love of learning or even his love of me.  So maybe I don&#39;t fit with the philosophy you are looking for.  BUT, I don&#39;t use any of the icky parenting techniques that you quoted above as negative examples.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Playmates for children","postDate":"1090854903","msgId":20159,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5OS4yYzVlNGQ4Yi4yZTM2NzlmN0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":20156,"nextInTopic":20164,"prevInTime":20158,"nextInTime":20160,"topicId":20079,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/26/04 8:50:06 AM, scubamama@earthlink.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1613698076\">In a message dated 7/26/04 8:50:06 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scubamama@...\">scubamama@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; My son is an only child, 3y/o.

I have been fortunate to <br/>\nhave several women friends with both of these same common <br/>\npreferences. We have been able to support each other on the phone, <br/>\nmostly. However, as our children have grown, it has become increasing <br/>\nmore difficult to coordinate our families&#39; schedules and play <br/>\npreferences: some like physical outdoor play at parks more than <br/>\nothers, some don&#39;t like the heat, visiting with a third or fourth <br/>\nchild is more difficult due to the &quot;luggage&quot; just to go anywhere for <br/>\nseveral hours, etc. So, we are able to see each of the families about <br/>\nonce a week or so. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is an only child, 3y/o. He loves to have children around. He <br/>\nwould like lots of children to play with every day for long periods. <br/>\nSo we go to the park and the pool. But here children are yelled at, <br/>\nscolded, directed, restricted, given time-outs, grabbed, ignored, <br/>\netc. You know, conventional parenting. Nothing &quot;abusive&quot; just the <br/>\nauthoritarian attitude of &quot;do it my way, or else&quot;. I have actually <br/>\nheard a mother tell a child &quot;stop right now, or else you won&#39;t get <br/>\ndinner, I am that serious&quot;. Apparently, the child wanted to play with <br/>\nsomething and wasn&#39;t even allowed to explore it, not breakable, just <br/>\nnoisy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we tried organized activities: Music Together, gym classes at the <br/>\nYMCA. Same thing, parents not treating the children with respect. Not <br/>\nlistened to. Not given a chance to voice their point of view. Told to <br/>\njust stop. Stop having an opinion. Do it my way, now.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we tried the La Leche park date. Same thing. Attachment parented <br/>\nbabies, but as soon as they are toddling around a bit, the children <br/>\nare discussed in front of them as: &quot;misbehaving&quot;, &quot;talking <br/>\nback&quot;, &quot;disobiedient&quot;, &quot;belligerent&quot;, told &quot;don&#39;t talk to me with <br/>\nthat tone&quot;, &quot;won&#39;t clean up their room&quot;, &quot;won&#39;t help with their <br/>\nyounger siblings&quot;, &quot;immature, old enough to know better&quot;, &quot;being <br/>\nstubborn, I told you to do it&quot;, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen the children are &quot;goin to be in trouble&quot;, &quot;going to have to <br/>\nleave, if they don&#39;t mind&quot;, told &quot;listen, I told you, do xyz&quot;, &quot;not <br/>\ngoing to be able to play later&quot;, &quot;won&#39;t get to watch videos&quot;, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, how do I meet my child&#39;s desire to have playmates and his need to <br/>\nlearn by watching others, when the environment and atmosphere with <br/>\nsome parents is domineering to the children? How do I create social <br/>\nopportunites for him to learn about life when the environment is so <br/>\nfull of judgement, threats and intimidation? I know that these women <br/>\nall mean well. They love their children dearly. They don&#39;t agree that <br/>\nthe pattern of coercion interferes with the child learning to love <br/>\nlife. And I really don&#39;t want my son to learn that the coercion that <br/>\nis being modelled is a way to interact with people, especially <br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow have you all handled similar situations over the years?<br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kay Alina&quot; &lt;angelsguard@s...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some years back, early 80&#39;s I think, I read an article that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>discussed <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; identification and belonging in the changing world, and it said <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that people will <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; identify with another person over common preference, like a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>favorite drink or <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; candy bar.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>**********************************************************************<br/>\n**<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have been thinking about the &quot;identity&quot; question and enjoying the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>responses.

I had an experience last week of having a blind date <br/>\nwith a mom and her kids at a local park.  We had conversed through a <br/>\nyahoo group and we had unschooling as a commonality.  They stopped by <br/>\nafter the park because I wanted to share some of the fish we caught <br/>\nin Alaska.  While<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; she was in the kitchen she saw a picture I had and asked a question <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and we <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; both realized we had something very personal in common.

We also had a great <br/>\n </span></blockquote>playdate.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I realized in the last month or so none of my friends were AP or <br/>\n </span></blockquote>unschooling.  We get together for playdates regularly but I realized <br/>\nit would be in my families best interest if I broaden our horizons <br/>\nand try to make some connections within our local community with <br/>\nothers of &quot;like mind.&quot;  I have never really thought of myself as <br/>\na &quot;group&quot; person although I was involved in the 12 step community for <br/>\nsome time.  We are not involved with a church and have very few <br/>\nfamily members.  I never clicked with the Mom&#39;s club in our area and <br/>\nthe friends we have now we met in Kindermusik a couple of years ago.  <br/>\nSo, thanks to the internet and yahoo groups we have recently joined <br/>\nboth unschooling, homeschooling the gifted, and attachment parenting <br/>\ngroups to find local get togethers.  I am really not a social <br/>\ncreature but I feel it is one of those consensual things I need to do <br/>\nfor Alex&#39;s needs as well as my own.  It is quite humbling to my ego <br/>\nto admit I want to &quot;belong&quot; somewhere.  That&#39;s where I am at the <br/>\nmoment.

Lots of people on the unschooling lists have <br/>\nscreennames about parenting or their children or homeschooling. <br/>\n <br/>\n=========================================================================<br/>\nI guess I see screen names differently than identifying myself with a group.<br/>\n(church, LLL, homeschool group, knitting group, book club, etc.) I think<br/>\nscreen names can identify something about you  (that I love games) without<br/>\naffiliating you with a group. <br/>\n <br/>\nWe recently got a new email server and I had to come up with a new email<br/>\nname. It was such a hard decision. (life&#39;s hard when you hardest decision is<br/>\nyour email address.  LOL!)  Over the last 4 plus years my email has been<br/>\nunschooling@------.  And I kept the unschooling part even when we changed<br/>\nproviders.  This last change I decided to step away from identifying myself<br/>\nto the world as &quot;unschooling&quot;. Sometimes there are times when I want to be<br/>\nmore discreet about who I am and what we do. (or don&#39;t do)  Everyone I know,<br/>\nit seems, comes up with such cute, creative email addresses.  I drew a total<br/>\nblank at first.  We were on a roll of playing Who-ville Opoly at the time<br/>\nand I almost picked Grinched or Whobilation.  I ended up picking something<br/>\nmore broad but on the same topic.  We just love games at our house and I did<br/>\nwant my email to say *something* about me while at the same time not causing<br/>\ntoo much controversy in any circle.  It doesn&#39;t however, affiliate me with a<br/>\ngroup of people.  I am sure there are other people who love games, but I am<br/>\nnot part of a group with that as their focus.  I don&#39;t really care if anyone<br/>\nelse loves games or not.  (except my family or I&#39;d have no one to play<br/>\nwith.) <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen someone asks how we homeschool I definitely say I&#39;m an unschooler.<br/>\nThere are words that I identify with....unschooler, attachment parent, etc,<br/>\nbut I am not affiliated with any groups that have these things as their<br/>\nfocus. <br/>\n  <br/>\n <br/>\n============================================================================<br/>\n==== <br/>\n Sandra wrote:<br/>\n I think sometimes there&#39;s an infatuation period with new things, and that<br/>\ncan <br/>\nbe really good for the cause, or the group. <br/>\n============================================================================<br/>\n=====<br/>\nAbsolutely!  I get the fever when I discover something wonderful and new.  I<br/>\njust want to share it with everyone!  <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n============================================================================<br/>\n===== <br/>\n Sandra wrote:<br/>\n But some people make a more long-term relationship with the thing they&#39;re <br/>\ninvolved in (church, LLL, environmentalism, whatever) and that&#39;s fine. <br/>\n <br/>\n============================================================================<br/>\n======<br/>\nThat&#39;s true, but so not me.  I tend to get into something and be really<br/>\nenthusiastic for a while. Then I move on to something else.  Although,<br/>\nloving games has never changed and I can&#39;t begin to imagine that wanting to<br/>\nunschool my kids would ever change.  But my enthusiasm for sharing it has<br/>\ndefinitely changed.  I don&#39;t want to change the world so much as I want to<br/>\nlive happily in my own little world.  Sounds selfish, doesn&#39;t it?  Although<br/>\nif someone were actually interested, I&#39;d happily share what works for us.<br/>\n <br/>\nPeople are definitely brought together by the things they share in common.<br/>\nI&#39;m glad we have ways to identify (label) ourselves so we can find like<br/>\nminded people to hang out with.

Maybe it&#39;s the theme of the week for me because I just finished<br/>\nreading an anthropological study on marriage and community yesterday too.<br/>\nI realized even three year olds bond over common preferences.  They will do<br/>\nit over underwear.  &quot;Look I have Power Rangers too!&quot;  It opens up a conversation.  I had an experience last week of having a blind date with a mom and her kids at a local park.  We had conversed through a yahoo group and we had unschooling as a commonality.  They stopped by after the park because I wanted to share some of the fish we caught in Alaska.  While<br/>\nshe was in the kitchen she saw a picture I had and asked a question and we <br/>\nboth realized we had something very personal in common.  I feel very linked<br/>\nto her because of the common preference.  We also had a great playdate.  <br/>\nI realized in the last month or so none of my friends were AP or unschooling.  We get together for playdates regularly but I realized it would be in my families best interest if I broaden our horizons and try to make some connections within our local community with others of &quot;like mind.&quot;  I have never really thought of myself as a &quot;group&quot; person although I was involved in the 12 step community for some time.  We are not involved with a church and have very few family members.  I never clicked with the Mom&#39;s club in our area and the friends we have now we met in Kindermusik a couple of years ago.  So, thanks to the internet and yahoo groups we have recently joined both unschooling, homeschooling the gifted, and attachment parenting groups to find local get togethers.  I am really not a social creature but I feel it is one of those consensual things I need to do for Alex&#39;s needs as well as my own.  It is quite humbling to my ego to admit I want to &quot;belong&quot; somewhere.  That&#39;s where I am at the moment.  Grateful that there is commonality in our large county and grateful to connect.<br/>\nKay<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":9543528,"authorName":"Dana Matt","from":"Dana Matt &lt;hoffmanwilson@...&gt;","profile":"hoffmanwilson","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] identity and wanting to &quot;belong&quot;","postDate":"1090767946","msgId":20110,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwNzI1MTUwNTQ2LjI5MDYxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwNDA1Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEyYS40NmYyMTQxMC4yZTM1MjFkMEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":20109,"nextInTopic":20113,"prevInTime":20109,"nextInTime":20111,"topicId":20079,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I am very interested to hear about/from people who belong to a lot of<br/>\ngroups or espouse many different philosophies or theories in contrast with<br/>\nthose people who just live life in the way they want/see fit, without any<br/>\nparticular books or theories leading them.  We are all on an unschooling<br/>\ndiscussion list so clearly we have all sought out this &quot;community,&quot; many of<br/>\nus have had past experience with La Leche League, in fact an extraordinary<br/>\nnumber of us are or were Leaders, there are people on this list who often<br/>\ntalk about their SCA participation or sports or a religious institution--we<br/>\nare already living our lives outside the &quot;norm&quot; in our country by<br/>\nunschooling.  I find it absolutely fascinating to learn about how others<br/>\ncreate identities for themselves and their families and find ways to<br/>\n&quot;belong&quot; while living this &quot;outside the box&quot; life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the point of my email is to ask people to think about, or write to<br/>\nthe list about what kind of affiliations they find helpful in their lives.<br/>\nI haven&#39;t heard of most of the organizations mentioned on this list.  I was<br/>\na LLL Leader so I know about things along that route.  I guess our family<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t really affiliate ourselves with any particular philosophy, we don&#39;t<br/>\neven call ourselves &quot;unschoolers.&quot;  That may change, at this point we are a<br/>\nfamily of three (2 adults and a 4 year old) who like each other and have way<br/>\nmore fun together than other families we know.<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw a bumper sticker I liked today it said &quot;You may all be laughing at ME<br/>\nbecause I&#39;m different, but I am laughing at YOU because you are all the<br/>\nsame.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a few thoughts,<br/>\n<br/>\nJen Lynch (who also has a bizarre interest in infomercials and their role in<br/>\ncreating and reflecting identity)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20117,"nextTopicId":20137}}
