","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-460929308\">It&#39;s Sunday  morning.  Later today I&#39;m going no-mail because we&#39;re going on a <br/>\nfamily vacation, driving.  I&#39;ll be back late the 8th, if all goes to schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrips like this scare me.  I&#39;m afraid of car trouble or accidents, or of a <br/>\nkid being sick or wounded far from home.  I like the feeling of being out and <br/>\nseeing new things and being with other unschoolers (that&#39;s most of my focus this <br/>\ntime, while Kirby and Marty have a gaming focus, going to GenCon, and Holly <br/>\nhas a roller coaster focus, and Keith is our heroic and patient protector).  I <br/>\nlike being with my family away from scattery schedules and distractions.  But <br/>\npacking and actually driving away is a stressful thing for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a housesitter one of the kids&#39; friends. I didn&#39;t tell him I always <br/>\ngive the dog a snack at night. Cheese, or meat.  I might forget.   I didn&#39;t tell <br/>\nhim I turn the cat food over if it&#39;s getting dry overnight.  It&#39;s not too <br/>\nlate to tell him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is one thing I don&#39;t want my kids to learn from me, this hesitation and <br/>\nworry and fear.  So I pretend courage, and I just ask them to help me <br/>\nchecklist the preparations.  They&#39;re pretty good at that.    It&#39;s one time I  keep my <br/>\nfears as secret as I can, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor people newish to this list, I thought I should make the reassurance that <br/>\nI don&#39;t mind it sitting quiet for long stretches of time and then being busy.  <br/>\nAnd if anyone wishes it weren&#39;t so quiet, there are other busier lists and <br/>\nsome of them are listed with links here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/lists/other\">http://sandradodd.com/lists/other</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAll my kids are teens now and two of them drive.  I remember family trips <br/>\nwhere I had to fasten two kids&#39; seatbelts every time we got back in the car.  Now <br/>\nI don&#39;t even have to pack for them.  But they&#39;re willing to go on a family <br/>\nvacation!  I think many families with would find it difficult to impossible to <br/>\nget happy agreement and cooperation from an 18 and 16 year old, so I do feel <br/>\ngood about that.  Every nuclear family experience could be the last, I&#39;ve been <br/>\nthinking for two years now.  There are no significant others or grandchildren <br/>\nyet.  I&#39;m trying to imprint these days on my happy-memory mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know some of you are still in the little-kids stage, and that&#39;s exhausting, <br/>\nso this might not be something you can identify with at all.  Someday, <br/>\nthough, you won&#39;t have to be the one to know where all the shoes and jackets are.  <br/>\nYou won&#39;t have to pack a diaper bag or sippie cups.  It seemed those days would <br/>\nnever end, but they did.   The days we have now, it seems likely they could <br/>\nend tomorrow.  Age and perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those of you braver than I am, wish me some of your calm, please. It will <br/>\nbe snowing in Gallup, they say, and all my eggs will be in one basket.  (It&#39;s <br/>\na Chevy conversion basket with a nice CD player and a bed in the back.  <br/>\nStill, I&#39;m afraid.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21280,"nextTopicId":21294}}
