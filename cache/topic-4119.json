We went hiking, which turned into snow shoeing, and snow ball<br/>\nfights and I think one frostbitten toe, but wow! <br/>\n<br/>\nWe haven&#39;t had much snow for the past few years and so haven&#39;t been snow<br/>\nshoeing.  But we all seemed to be suffering from cabin fever over the<br/>\nweekend and decided to head out.   We did find snow deep enough to<br/>\nwarrant the snow shoes.  <br/>\nDylan had a wonderful time, had more stamina than we did and wants to go<br/>\nagain next weekend.  Lots of time on the Playstation I think,  has made<br/>\nhim a dead aim with snow balls as well.   We left a snow man standing out<br/>\nthere  and felt bad when we got home that he was all alone.  If he&#39;s<br/>\nstill there next weekend we&#39;ll make him a friend.   My husband says a<br/>\nsnow dog lifting his leg on Mr. Snowman would be funny, but Dylan doesn&#39;t<br/>\nseem too impressed.<br/>\nSaw lots of deer and elk and one coyote.  <br/>\nIf my toe doesn&#39;t fall off everything will be perfect.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L,  sore but happy.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4071,"nextTopicId":4124}}
