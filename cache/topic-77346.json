But I let it through because I wanted to say that moving from one state to another is more extreme than unschooling, and the conditions in which bullying can thrive are present in all school situations.

Schools will claim and bluster “you need to wait until after the semester to move” or whatever, but schools have zero say in whether a family can move, withdraw, enroll, etc.  If you prove residence and age, I think that’s all that’s required.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":327852347,"authorName":"Tress Miles","from":"Tress Miles &lt;milesdt@...&gt;","profile":"abacaxi7476","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Progress Report Required for Daughter returning to school after unschooling","postDate":"1469450525","msgId":77352,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBRkxLeTMxMXIyNkNOOGEydzJHNlI3cWsyb1ZSaXhuUkF6VzlrRHNzMmpRUjZwLUdDQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDMxNTU0NjM0MS4xOTM4Mjg2LjE0NjgzNTExODYyNTYuSmF2YU1haWwueWFob29AbWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDMxNTU0NjM0MS4xOTM4Mjg2LjE0NjgzNTExODYyNTYuSmF2YU1haWwueWFob28ucmVmQG1haWwueWFob28uY29tPiA8MzE1NTQ2MzQxLjE5MzgyODYuMTQ2ODM1MTE4NjI1Ni5KYXZhTWFpbC55YWhvb0BtYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":77351,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":77351,"nextInTime":77353,"topicId":77346,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve been homeschooling/unschooling in GA for 9 years.

However, the school, I imagine, only want to know what she&#39;s been up to and are couching it in terms of &#39;progress&#39; because they&#39;re a school. Don&#39;t panic. I can&#39;t see that it&#39;s a test, simply to give them an idea of what she might know or not know already. So just send them a brief report of the kinds of things she&#39;s done over the last year and explain that you haven&#39;t been doing formal work with her due to needing to help her heal from her damaging time in school previously.<br><br>Clare</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-237420756gmail_extra\"><br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-237420756gmail_quote\">On 12 July 2016 at 20:19, Kate Crussie <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katecrussie@...\">katecrussie@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] <span dir=\"ltr\">&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-237420756gmail_quote\" style=\"margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;\">\n\n\n\n\n<u></u>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div style=\"background-color:#fff;\">\n<span> </span>\n\n\n\n\n<div>\n  <div>\n\n\n\n\n    <div>\n\n\n      <p></p><div style=\"color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;\"><div>Our 12 year old daughter is returning to school in a month after de-schooling for the past year.  She begged us to move so she could start over again and leave the neighborhood and the school district where she was bullied.  We moved from New Jersey to Georgia and are being asked for a HomeSchool progress report of her learning from last year.  Does anyone have any advice for us?  Any forms you know of that we could possibly use to satisfy the district requirements? </div><div>The school system is so vastly different than what she&#39;s used to that she&#39;s chosen to do the first year here using their on-line school and then plans to attend their physical school next year.  Either way we need a form documenting her progress.  </div><div><br></div><div>Kate</div></div><p></p>\n\n\n    </div>\n\n\n\n\n    <div style=\"color:#fff;min-height:0;\"></div>\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div></div></blockquote></div><br></span></blockquote></div>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":500655255,"authorName":"Kate Crussie","from":"Kate Crussie &lt;katecrussie@...&gt;","profile":"katecrussie","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Progress Report Required for Daughter returning to school after unschooling","postDate":"1468351186","msgId":77346,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMxNTU0NjM0MS4xOTM4Mjg2LjE0NjgzNTExODYyNTYuSmF2YU1haWwueWFob29AbWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDMxNTU0NjM0MS4xOTM4Mjg2LjE0NjgzNTExODYyNTYuSmF2YU1haWwueWFob28ucmVmQG1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":77348,"prevInTime":77345,"nextInTime":77347,"topicId":77346,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Our 12 year old daughter is returning to school in a month after de-schooling for the past year.  She begged us to move so she could start over again and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1239437874\"><html><head></head><div style=\"color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1239437874yui_3_16_0_1_1468349964740_6482\">Our 12 year old daughter is returning to school in a month after de-schooling for the past year. &nbsp;She begged us to move so she could start over again and leave the neighborhood and the school district where she was bullied. &nbsp;We moved from New Jersey to Georgia and are being asked for a HomeSchool progress report of her learning from last year. &nbsp;Does anyone have any advice for us? &nbsp;Any forms you know of that we could possibly use to satisfy the district requirements?&nbsp;</div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1239437874yui_3_16_0_1_1468349964740_6482\">The school system is so vastly different than what she&#39;s used to that she&#39;s chosen to do the first year here using their on-line school and then plans to attend their physical school next year. &nbsp;Either way we need a form documenting her progress. &nbsp;</div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1239437874yui_3_16_0_1_1468349964740_6482\"><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1239437874yui_3_16_0_1_1468349964740_6482\">Kate</div></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77316,"nextTopicId":77342}}
