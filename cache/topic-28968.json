(Marty has been on a big Prince jag lately, but I  <br/>\nhaven&#39;t shared that one with him because I don&#39;t think he knows the  <br/>\nJoni Mitchell version, and we&#39;ve been really busy.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the second amazing-coincidence accidental song find of the  <br/>\nday.  It&#39;s not like I was looking through a bunch of YouTube stuff.   <br/>\nI was looking for a specific thing unrelated to either of them and  <br/>\nfound them both.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other was a version of &quot;Take a Whiff,&quot; an old cocaine song I have  <br/>\non a Cisco Houston album (33 rpm antique), which Holly and I wrote  <br/>\nverses for for a friend of ours who said once &quot;Smell me--take a  <br/>\nwhiff&quot; because he had put cologne on.  Longer funnier story, but  <br/>\nanyway... today I found something called &quot;Take a Drink on Me&quot; with  <br/>\nphotos of pubs in Wales (and other mostly worthless stuff, and exotic  <br/>\nurinals at the end) and it was that very same song, which we first  <br/>\nsang for our friend last weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nWEIRD.<br/>\n<br/>\nOH!  And about &quot;A Case of You,&quot; I&#39;m very glad the guy made this.   <br/>\nIt&#39;s very much like Blackbird, by Paul McCartney, which is also  <br/>\nplayed almost exclusively on the G and B strings!  Guitarists will  <br/>\nappreciate this, and others might not mind it much.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[{"url":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/wfUHYzDxTkk?wmode=opaque","type":"VIDEO"}]}],"prevTopicId":28931,"nextTopicId":28981}}
