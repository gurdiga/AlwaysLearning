Manufactured nibs for a while after that.<br/>\nWhen I was in elementary school, there were still some old wooden desks in the oldest building that had a hole for holding an ink well, and a groove next to it, vertically on the desk top, not horizontally like a pencil slot.  From the basement, when I was a teacher, I liberated a teacher&#39;s classroom-sized bottle of ink, with a lid for pouring into little inkwells.  I guess they got the rest back in with a funnel; didn&#39;t see an ink-stained funnel there.<br/>\n<br/>\nMemorizing times tables and perfectly round penmanship have to do with clerks who might work in businesses keeping ledgers, adding and subtracting deposits, payments, debits and charges, by hand, in books that would be legal records, and entered and read by others for decades.  Artsy personalized writing was no good.  It wasn&#39;t personal.<br/>\n<br/>\nA good use of schools, in the 19th century, was for a place where kids could see maps and globes.  Those didn&#39;t exist outside of schools, libraries or rich houses.<br/>\nYesterday, easy as pie, I looked up the Harry Potter Adventure park in Orlando.  I just started entering that, and google filled in the rest, and I zoomed in and looked at a satellite image of the buildings.  Labelled image.<br/>\n<br/>\nEncyclopedias, at schools.  We had one at our house, but from like 1954, so I loved that the school library and sometimes a classroom had newer ones.  I would read them for fun.  When my kids were little I bought one, so it&#39;s 1989 or whatever.  :-)  I have them as curiosities, but they&#39;re not worth opening when there&#39;s google at hand.

I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-76306252\">Regarding the chanting of multiplication tables: if you are someone without a reliable memory, memorizing is absolutely the worst way to learn something. I wonder how many others have this &quot;problem&quot;.  I know it&#39;s not an ideal way for anyone to learn, but if you can&#39;t rely on your memory, it can be pretty scary if that&#39;s the only tool you are given. I was always able to manage well in other areas, because I always knew how to find information, and I was able to make sense of the subjects in other ways.  But to this day I struggle and laugh off my lack of ability with math.  I just can&#39;t think about it reasonably or logically - which is how I go about everything else - that logic as far as math is concerned was long ago programmed out, and frankly, I feel &quot;disabled&quot; (in math) because of it. Thankfully my kids don&#39;t/won&#39;t have that disability.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding how to hold a pen being based on the use of a quill pen 100 years ago: once you back away and look at what I like to call the &quot;school myth&quot; objectively, it makes it a little easier to look around and see what else might be a myth, or at least no longer applicable. Amazing how little we (as a society) question the &quot;whys&quot; of our practices. In my working life, if I questioned a practice, and the response I got was &quot;because that&#39;s the way we&#39;ve always done it&quot;, it was a red flag for me to examine and usually change that practice.  In society, examination or change in certain areas is scarier than the comfort of &quot;we&#39;ve always done it this way&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\n--Melissa C.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;luvkadcl@...&quot; &lt;luvkadcl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My children do it that way too :) As a child I was taught to memorize.
