My older son went to public school for some classes (band, art), and his girlfriend, sister, and all his friends were in school. The message is that you need to know THESE things to be successful, you need to study THIS subject. Learning happens because of teachers. It&#39;s a strong message, and one the public school (and the kids there) spout very confidently and don&#39;t often question. <br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-106552282yui_3_16_0_1_1424100497479_5247\" dir=\"ltr\"><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-106552282yui_3_16_0_1_1424100497479_5066\" dir=\"ltr\">If, on top of that, your son went in, having spent recent years unschooling, there may be LOTS of stuff he doesn&#39;t know that he&#39;s &quot;SUPPOSED TO&quot;, according to them. He may have felt afraid that he is hopelessly behind where he should be because he&#39;s &quot;wasted&quot; his time playing games.&nbsp;</div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-106552282yui_3_16_0_1_1424100497479_5478\" dir=\"ltr\"><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-106552282yui_3_16_0_1_1424100497479_5479\" dir=\"ltr\">For now, maybe just try to spend time with him, engage with him, watch him play video games, enjoy it with him. I used to bring a snack up for my son and then sit with him and watch him play for a bit. I also found he was more interested at chatting at about 1 in the morning, while he was playing or while he was fixing himself a bedtime snack. He wouldn&#39;t &quot;sit down&quot; for a discussion, but would make comments and chat a bit, without the pressure of &quot;let&#39;s talk&quot; or needing to make eye contact or anything. <br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-106552282yui_3_16_0_1_1424100497479_5333\" dir=\"ltr\"><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-106552282yui_3_16_0_1_1424100497479_5354\" dir=\"ltr\"> <br> </div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-106552282yui_3_16_0_1_1424100497479_4751\" dir=\"ltr\"><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-106552282yui_3_16_0_1_1424100497479_4752\" dir=\"ltr\"><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-106552282yui_3_16_0_1_1424100497479_4546\" style=\"font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\"> <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-106552282yui_3_16_0_1_1424100497479_4545\" style=\"font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;\"> <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-106552282yui_3_16_0_1_1424100497479_4544\" dir=\"ltr\"> <hr id=\"ygrps-yiv-106552282yui_3_16_0_1_1424100497479_4928\" size=\"1\">  <font id=\"ygrps-yiv-106552282yui_3_16_0_1_1424100497479_4543\" size=\"2\" face=\"Arial\"> <b><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">From:</span></b> &quot;justinmichellec@...

All of what you wrote is about what he&#39;s doing wrong and what he could do to fix it. How often do you drop in to chat? To ask him what he&#39;s discovered, what his favorite recent happenings are? How often do you listen just to find out more about him without using what he says as a way to assess whether he&#39;s thinking &quot;right&quot;? You say he played video games non stop. What do you know about the games? Have you asked him to show you his favorites? Asked why he likes them over other games? Perhaps ask him if there are games he thinks you might like?
