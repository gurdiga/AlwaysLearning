A striking proportion of rain forest dwellers <br/>\nare polytheistic, worshipping an array of spirits and gods. Polytheism is <br/>\nprevalent among tribes in the Amazon basin (the Sherenti, Mundurucu, and <br/>\nTapirape) and in the rain forests of Africa (the Ndorobo), New Guinea (the <br/>\nKeraki and Ulawans), and Southeast Asia (the Iban of Borneo and the Mnong <br/>\nGar and Lolo of Vietnam). But desert dwellers-the bedouin of Arabia, the <br/>\nBerbers of the western Sahara, the !Kung of the Kalahari Desert, the Nuer <br/>\nand Turkana of the Kenyan/Sudanese desert-are usually monotheistic. Of <br/>\ncourse, despite allegiances to a single deity, other supernatural beings may <br/>\nbe involved, like angels and djinns and Satan. But the hierarchy is notable, <br/>\nwith minor deities subservient to the Omnipotent One.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis division makes ecological sense. Deserts teach large, singular lessons, <br/>\nlike how tough, spare, and withholding the environment is; the world is <br/>\nreduced to simple, desiccated, furnace-blasted basics. Then picture rain <br/>\nforest people amid an abundance of edible plants and medicinal herbs, able <br/>\nto identify more species of ants on a single tree than one would find in all <br/>\nthe British Isles. Letting a thousand deities bloom in this sort of setting <br/>\nmust seem natural. Moreover, those rain forest dwellers that are <br/>\nmonotheistic are much less likely to believe that their god sticks his or <br/>\nher nose into other people&#39;s business by controlling the weather, prompting <br/>\nillness, or the like. In contrast, the desert seems to breed fatalism, a <br/>\nbelief in an interventionist god with its own capricious plans.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and wandering through The TED one day I found an excerpt of Julia <br/>\nSweeney&#39;s solo performance &quot;Letting Go of God&quot; which is an interesting look <br/>\nat her own faith: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/86\">http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/86</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Sandra Dodd&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, July 09, 2007 4:20 PM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Religion question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; This isn&#39;t about current religion, but about prehistoric and<br/>\n&gt; instinctive religion.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Holly asked me yesterday, and we were starting to discuss it, and<br/>\n&gt; then Keith and Marty wanted to show us a concrete job they had just<br/>\n&gt; finished, and invite Holly to put something in the wet concrete, so<br/>\n&gt; we got distracted.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; She asked if it&#39;s instinctive to think the sky is better than the<br/>\n&gt; fiery underground, what else have people worshipped, since not all<br/>\n&gt; religions are sun-based.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good question.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I said trees, and rocks...   then we took off for the concrete project.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What else?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bears (the Ainu, the indigenous people of Japan)<br/>\n&gt; Ancestors (Chinese and thereabout??)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are some lesser sacred-animal or sacred-object situations I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t think qualify as &quot;worship&quot;:  cows in Delhi, monkeys at some one<br/>\n&gt; temple in India, cats in ancient Egypt??
