I don&#39;t want to <br/>\nbe like the insurance salesman that everyone avoids!<br/>\n<br/>\nLuckily for us, we had a couple of really outgoing kids in the group last <br/>\nyear.  Their parents gave them a script to sell the candy and they were bold <br/>\nenough to execute it.  The script is simple:  &quot;Hi (or good afternoon), would <br/>\nyou like to buy some CF candy?&quot;  If the answer is no, then they say &quot;okay, <br/>\nthank you!&quot;.  If it&#39;s yes, then they bring the person to the table where the <br/>\nadults basically just make the transaction.  Most of the kids are good at <br/>\nsaying thank you when the folks are leaving with their candy, too.  My son <br/>\nlearned to sell this way, and their example was invaluable.  Now those two <br/>\nkids are gone and my son and others who learned from them is passing it down <br/>\nthis year.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a philosophy that we can&#39;t claim credit for, but has been very <br/>\nuseful.  We code it SW-SW-SW....it means, &quot;some will, some won&#39;t, so what?&quot;  <br/>\nThe kids have really grasped that and it gives them just the umph to keep on <br/>\nasking in the face of many rejections.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday a very nice thing happened.  First sale of the day.  My son asked the <br/>\nquestion of a woman coming out of the store, and she stopped and said, &quot;Of <br/>\ncourse I will!  But you have to do one thing for me.  I will buy the candy, <br/>\nbut you have to give it to someone who would like it, but can&#39;t really afford <br/>\nit.&quot;  Then she said, &quot;Do you know why I bought candy from you?  Because you <br/>\nASKED me to.  I&#39;m in sales, and that&#39;s the really only way to sell anything!  <br/>\nAsk for it!&quot;    :))))<br/>\n<br/>\nLater in the day Will gave that box to a mom with children who was really <br/>\nhaving a tough time.  He told her it was a gift that someone else had <br/>\npurchased for her.  I thought the whole thing was very sweet.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Advice - school donation request","postDate":"1038071772","msgId":10940,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMS4xLjUuMC4yMDAyMTEyMzA4NTgzOC4wMGE0MmVjMEBwb3AzLm5vcnRvbi5hbnRpdmlydXM+","inReplyToHeader":"PDZmLjMxNDMyMjhmLjJiMTBiMTE4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":10932,"nextInTopic":10962,"prevInTime":10939,"nextInTime":10941,"topicId":10533,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think fund-raising can be good for the kids too, depending on how it is done.

I don&#39;t think kids should be allowed to put <br/>\ntheir parents friends, relatives, and neighbors &quot;on the spot&quot; where they <br/>\nfeel like they have to give the kid money or look like a cheapskate and I <br/>\ndo NOT let my kids do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am totally absolutely FINE with the kids letting people know - &quot;We&#39;re <br/>\nselling magazine subscriptions - we have a HUGE selection of magazines, you <br/>\ncan renew your existing subscriptions with us, and our prices are very <br/>\ngood. So let me know if you&#39;d like a catalog or want to order <br/>\nsomething.&quot;  THEN walk away and let it go. Don&#39;t try to talk me into it. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think it is remotely cute for kids to be learning to beg other people <br/>\nto support their fun --- &quot;You should buy it because we really want to go on <br/>\nthis trip and we can&#39;t afford it without your help.&quot; So I should buy <br/>\nsomething overpriced that I don&#39;t even really want so that somebody else&#39;s <br/>\nkid can do something that their family can&#39;t afford? I really don&#39;t see <br/>\nthat as anything except begging. Again - offer goods or services - good <br/>\nquality, low price - if people want them let them buy them -- I&#39;m talking <br/>\nabout kids putting friends and relatives on the spot to buy things they do <br/>\nNOT want and don&#39;t value.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you expect me to buy something I don&#39;t even want, just to give your kids <br/>\na little money to do something -- I don&#39;t see that as any different AT ALL <br/>\nthen the little girl begging for a quarter to buy herself a candy.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids will learn good lessons from fund-raising where they offer people a <br/>\nreal product that they want or a real service -- but to expect all their <br/>\nfriends to buy something whether they want it or not - to put pressure on <br/>\nfriends like that- is teaching them a whole different lesson, imo.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 02:23 AM 11/23/2002, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;In a message dated 11/22/2002 8:34:56 PM Central Standard Time,<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think it is wrong to ask<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other people to support our own children, financially.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We had this discussion last night at the candy sale, regarding fundraisers<br/>\n&gt;for public schools.
