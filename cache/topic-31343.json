So what she said was she was <br/>\nsurprised the dog wasn&#39;t  overweight.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause there&#39;s food down, the dog eats when she&#39;s hungry.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a cat (around 15 years old) who&#39;s never had a serious lack of food,  <br/>\nnever starved, never had to compete for food. His mother was with us a few <br/>\nyears  before he was born in our dining room, and he&#39;s never been outside the  <br/>\nhouse except being carried to the car for vet trips or moving. We leave food  <br/>\ndown all the time for our cats, too. Sometimes, we get busy and the dish gets  <br/>\nemptied (rare)-not daily, maybe once a week-for an hour or a few hours. As soon <br/>\n as that food hits the empty dish (the sound draws all the cats), and the <br/>\nhumans  have vacated the room, he goes straight to the dish, eats until he&#39;s so <br/>\nfull  that he barfs it back out again, then proceeds to eat (fresh food from <br/>\nthe bowl)  until he&#39;s had enough and walks away.

It doesn&#39;t <br/>\n*seem* like  a serious amount of time to be &quot;lack&quot; or &quot;panic&quot; or some sort of <br/>\nmental state  that one would never have enough food again, but apparently, it <br/>\nseems that way  to him... Could easily be applied to one&#39;s kids-not <br/>\nnecessarily lack of food,  per se, but perception. <br/>\n <br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nDe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s new at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31291,"nextTopicId":31362}}
