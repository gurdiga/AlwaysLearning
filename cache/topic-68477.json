PLEASE, anyone who is even kind of sort of considering a separation, stop and think a long, long time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s below was posted today on Unschooling Basics, by Caren Knox-Hudley. It&#39;s big.   Alex Polikowsky asked her for permission to share it.  I&#39;ve added it to my divorce page.   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/divorce\">http://sandradodd.com/divorce</a>   .<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nFor years, I believed that my parents&#39; divorce was not harmful to me. When it happened, it felt like a reliefï¿½the house was so much LESS tense, there was more laughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI separated from my husband 9 years ago, still believing that I hadn&#39;t been harmed by divorce. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s only been in the past couple of years that I&#39;ve been able to acknowledge how deeply painful and damaging my parents&#39; divorce was. Because of my obliviousness, I caused similar pain for my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis hasn&#39;t been easy to feel.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot every child will be harmed in a car crash, but that doesn&#39;t mean if a crash is avoidable, it&#39;s OK to ram our car into someone else&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I failed to consider when I was in such denial/ignorance/oblivion was this: How much better would it have been if my parents had bucked up, done the work to get closer and happier, and stayed together? What would I have learned about relationships, and commitment?<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven a choice between a miserable marriage and unhappy family life or divorce, divorce seems the better choice. But there are other choices, choices that CAN and DO and HAVE made the difference in peoples&#39; relationships. There&#39;s the choice to grow your relationship and your marriage, and do what you can to make it as good as it can be.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t spend time mired in the past, wishing I had done things differently, but if I had known what I&#39;ve learned after being on these unschooling lists - things about being generous, taking responsibility, helping create a peaceful home life, appreciating my husband - we would never have separated.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is incredibly freakin&#39; difficult being a single unschooling parent - and this is WITH the support of the boys&#39; dads. <br/>\n<br/>\nCaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
