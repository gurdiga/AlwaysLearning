Musical Intelligence! How can unschooling parents nourish and expand their children&#39;s lives to include opportunities for them to explore and exercise that part of them?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is it like, this &quot;musical intelligence&quot;? What does it connect to?  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest of the series is:<br/>\n<br/>\nMay 5 Visual/spatial intelligence (transcript is still in the chatroom, or will be at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://chattranscripts.blogspot.com\">http://chattranscripts.blogspot.com</a> after May 10)<br/>\nMay 12 Musical intelligence<br/>\nMay 19 Verbal/linguistic intelligence<br/>\nMay 26 Logical/mathematical intelligence<br/>\nJune 2 Interpersonal intelligence<br/>\nJune 9 Intrapersonal intelligence<br/>\nJune 16 Bodily/kinesthetic intelligence<br/>\n<br/>\nJune 23 Naturalistic (added as #8)<br/>\n<br/>\nJune 30 Existential / spiritual (in consideration—not fully accepted) <br/>\n<br/>\nMore about the room, how to get in there, and how to use it, is here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://chatnotes-unschooling.blogspot.com\">http://chatnotes-unschooling.blogspot.com</a> (at the “When, where and how” tab).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso at that link, you can subscribe to chat reminders.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here is something to read (in the tabs up top) if you’re not sure whether a chat like this will be any fun for you.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTranscripts of older chats are scattered around my site and this transcripts blog (and some just still on my computer).  Many are linked, but not all.  Still working on gathering them up.  There have been years when there were two a week, and seasons when there were none.
