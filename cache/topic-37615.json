Her symptoms included severe hyperactivity<br/>\ndangerously combined with impulsivity (such as no thought or care<br/>\nbefore running into a busy street), inability to focus and related<br/>\nfrustration with herself, very oppositional behavior, poor eye<br/>\ncontact, difficulty listening, emotional hypersensitivity, social<br/>\nanxiety, overwhelmed by clean-up projects.  She would say very<br/>\nnegative things about herself and had chronic headaches.  Her ADHD<br/>\ncounterpart of autistic &quot;flapping&quot; was endless somersaulting on our<br/>\nottoman just to keep herself in motion.  Sometimes she would launch<br/>\nherself into belly-flops onto the ottoman or a bed just to keep<br/>\nherself in motion.  Another repetitive type of behavior would be<br/>\ncontinuous rewinding to listen to a tiny segment of music or a DVD<br/>\nover and over again.  It is with untold gratitude to posts on ADHD<br/>\nsupport lists and other research under &quot;ADHD&quot; that these symptoms are<br/>\na thing of the past for her--a nightmare for the whole family that has<br/>\nfinally ended.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe long, tedious journey through research eventually prompted me to<br/>\ntry the Feingold Diet and gluten-free casein free, as well as dietary<br/>\nsupplements.  These all helped tremendously.  Then finally, through<br/>\none of the ADHD lists, I discovered NAET (www.naet.org).  You sure<br/>\nwon&#39;t hear this in the mainstream, but it turns out that she, like<br/>\nmost with ADHD, autism, dyslexia, Tourette Syndrome, etc., had many<br/>\ntypes of hidden/internal allergies to various foods and chemicals.<br/>\nThese allergies result in central-nervous-system blockages as well as<br/>\nlack of proper absorption of nutrients from food.  The part of the<br/>\nbrain involved in ADHD was malnourished/starving.  (There are even<br/>\nbooks about this dietary aspect such as &quot;Children With Starving<br/>\nBrains&quot;, &quot;Is This Your Child?&quot;, &quot;The Gut-Brain Connection&quot;, &quot;Healing<br/>\nThe New Childhood Epidemics: Autism, ADHD, Asthma, and Allergies&quot;, and<br/>\n&quot;Say Good-bye To ADD and ADHD&quot;.)  Behavioral allergies to otherwise<br/>\nhealthy foods are often involved as well.  My DD had behavioral<br/>\nreactions to oranges that would last for a good two or three days.<br/>\nShe also reacted to perfumes, pesticides, food additives.  She was<br/>\nfound to be allergic to her own dopamine and neurotransmitters.  NAET<br/>\nis non-invasive energy medicine that works extremely well (in the<br/>\nhands of a quality, experienced practitioner) to eliminate all kinds<br/>\nof allergies (which in DD&#39;s case, manifested as behavioral reactions).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe many factors in acquiring such allergies include our Western diets<br/>\nand food additives.  As DD is able to understand, I will be teaching<br/>\nher about the importance of a healthy diet (which is not the food<br/>\npyramid and not low fat--www.westonaprice.org, www.mercola.com) to<br/>\nhelp prevent her from re-developing allergies, to be vigilant to the<br/>\nsigns of ADHD that could signal that she has redeveloped allergies, to<br/>\nthe dangers of allowing any ADHD relapse to go untreated.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, DD&#39;s ADHD was accompanied by the gifts of a fairly<br/>\nphotographic memory and exceptional creativity...both of which she<br/>\nstill has!!<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling for everyone, labels not needed","postDate":"1220153109","msgId":37698,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGc5ZDJ1bCszMHM3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ4QjlERTc5LjkwNjA5MDBAZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":37697,"nextInTopic":37701,"prevInTime":37697,"nextInTime":37699,"topicId":37615,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~I wanted to go back to when I thought he was incredible.~~ Yes.

I think what<br/>\n&gt; we as a society consider &quot;normal&quot; is what&#39;s screwed up. BUT, my<br/>\n&gt; youngest child would have definitely been labeled &quot;on the spectrum&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How would I know this? We chose to do some Neuro-feedback (like<br/>\n&gt; biofeedback but a lot more therapeutic) about a year ago. It was done<br/>\n&gt; by a close friend who supports our parenting style 100% and is very<br/>\n&gt; patient and gentle with my son when he&#39;s melting down or being intense<br/>\n&gt; in some manner.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The intake form she did was VERY thorough. It took me about two hours<br/>\n&gt; to go through it with her (without my child there). The psychologist<br/>\n&gt; mentoring her during this process confirmed my suspicions that he<br/>\n&gt; would have been labeled &quot;Aspergers&quot; or something &quot;on the spectrum&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I never sought that opinion. Mary knew I had done research and needed<br/>\n&gt; to understand my child to better support his needs. I had taken my<br/>\n&gt; personal research to her as a friend who understood how I NEVER, EVER<br/>\n&gt; wanted to seek out a &quot;fix&quot; or label him in any way. So in the end, I<br/>\n&gt; did get a professional opinion that he would be diagnosed with exactly<br/>\n&gt; what I suspected.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The only reason the research even happened was in an effort for ME to<br/>\n&gt; learn and grow and understand how to support my child. It was so<br/>\n&gt; important at one phase in our journey. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rather than trying to make him fit the environment, we try to create<br/>\n&gt; environments in which he can fully blossom. As he gets older, his<br/>\n&gt; intensities lessen, he finds more coping tools and things get better<br/>\n&gt; for him. Just like all of us. I have a feeling that most of what would<br/>\n&gt; have gotten labeled in him, will have disappeared by the time he&#39;s an<br/>\n&gt; adult. All that therapy and crap that gets shoved on these kids can do<br/>\n&gt; a lot of damage to their sense of self....which is HUGE.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The Neurofeedback lasted a few sessions, he decided he was done with<br/>\n&gt; it and we didn&#39;t pursue it again. He now asks Mary if he can play the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;brain games&quot; when he&#39;s at her house sometimes. They helped him feel<br/>\n&gt; really calm and soothed. I did it with him and I loved how soothing it<br/>\n&gt; was. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, the entire point of this is so that in a discussion like this<br/>\n&gt; people can&#39;t say &quot;oh, you just don&#39;t understand&quot;. I DO understand. I<br/>\n&gt; understand that there are very FEW places in the entire WORLD that<br/>\n&gt; will help you see your child as PERFECT exactly as they are and try to<br/>\n&gt; give you tools for being a more effective parent without trying to<br/>\n&gt; alter your child.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are very FEW places that will encourage you to drop labels and<br/>\n&gt; grow more as a human being. This is one such place. Why on earth<br/>\n&gt; create yet ANOTHER place that is &quot;ok with labels&quot;???<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The world has enough of that readily available EVERYWHERE you turn.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ren<br/>\n&gt; learninginfreedom.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think this helps point out what I see as the difference between a<br/>\nlabel and a diagnosis.  No, I do not want to label my child, but we<br/>\ndid need to better understand him.  We sought out a medical diagnosis.<br/>\n At the time that is what helped *us* help our child.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow that he has left public school and we have moved into unschooling,<br/>\nthe diagnosis is hardly needed.  I say hardly not never.... He enjoys<br/>\na camp with other Tourette Syndrome children in the summer and could<br/>\nnot continue to attend without his diagnosis.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I have found with unschoolers is that I need to do a lot less<br/>\nexplaining about why he does certain things.  We do not have to<br/>\nintroduce our child and a list of labels, diagnoses, or personality<br/>\ntraits - he just IS.  We, as a family, feel more authentic.  He has<br/>\nnot been cured of Tourette Syndrome or OCD but has found more peace in<br/>\nnot focusing on it.  If it helps another child or family to know that<br/>\nmy child has TS or OCD, we will share.  When he goes to TS camp and<br/>\nthe other kids are bringing in bags and bottles of medications to make<br/>\ntheir behaviour more socially acceptable, maybe he and unschooling can<br/>\nbe a bit of a testament to alternatives as he has been able to remain<br/>\nmed free.  Aidan does not mind in the least that people know he has TS<br/>\nor OCD and he LOVES unschooling.  Maybe by sharing a diagnosis, we can<br/>\nhelp others who come looking for help for their own children.  I<br/>\nunderstand that each family is different, but in our home, I do not<br/>\nthink that a child can be made to think less of themselves because of<br/>\na *diagnosis*.  A *label* can be damaging.  If I were to say this is<br/>\nmy goth daughter Jane, here is my Touretter Aidan, my jock Noel, and<br/>\nthe baby Gareth - yeah, that would be a problem.  But if for example,<br/>\nsomebody comes to an unschooling list saying will unschooling work for<br/>\nmy child with Tourette Syndrome who has accommodations x, y, and z at<br/>\nschool??  Yep, yes it will AND you can throw away the IEP AND you will<br/>\nnever have to go to another case conference meeting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think sometimes it easier for an always unschooling family to live<br/>\nwithout a diagnosis and a trust in unschooling.  Those of us who got<br/>\nthere later, may need more concrete examples of how it works.  If it<br/>\nhelps others, we will share.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDonna <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a funny coincidence - I checked my mail while composing and editing<br/>\nthis email.  We just received an invite to a TS family camp weekend in<br/>\nMay of 2009.

There&#39;s a higher level of mental and physical energy that time and <br/>\ntime again Unschoolers are willing to expend. It&#39;s inspiring.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I have come to just assume that all parents will do whatever it takes. <br/>\nIt takes a thumping great reminder that most won&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe short story is that Jayn and one of her friends had an altercation at <br/>\nher house, and it turned out that the mom was taking a nap in the other room <br/>\nso Jayn and two siblings had been left unsupervised. All the kids had pretty <br/>\ndifferent stories about what happened. The little girl is going through some <br/>\nemotional development stuff right now including a lot of big &quot;overreaction&quot; <br/>\nscreaming to other kids, running to &quot;tell&quot; even when no-one has hurt her, <br/>\nwhich all look like crying out for even more attention than the mom gives <br/>\n(who is by no means inattentive!).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did some email back and forth, and I suggested that the kids really <br/>\nneeded an adult presence when they play to be more proactive in snuffing out <br/>\nconflicts before they became huge, and so that someone observing would know <br/>\nwhat was really happened and be able to sort out the conflicting accounts. I <br/>\nexpressed my willingness to continue to be present in the room when they <br/>\nplay here, and always to watch them outside, even with how inconvenient that <br/>\ncould be for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other mother flat refused to change anything that she was doing, and <br/>\ntold me she intended to continue to wait to be called if they needed <br/>\nmediation - which to give credit where it is due, she is very good at. It <br/>\nwas up to me to set limits for Jayn at their house. Well the last is <br/>\ncertainly true, but difficult. In the past I have been guilty of using <br/>\nJayn&#39;s playtime with these kids as a bit of a break for me, when I could get <br/>\nsome writing or other work done. I suspect the other mom has the same <br/>\nfeeling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m trying to understand her point of view. It seems to me that she values <br/>\nindependence and self-sufficiency and wants to give her kids the <br/>\n&quot;opportunity&quot; to work stuff out. I guess from an Unschooling pov she is <br/>\npushing them to self-sufficiency. I&#39;m seeing the disparity of age/maturity <br/>\nbetween the three kids as a factor that works against her goals, as well as <br/>\nrecalling the history of dishonesty that has permeated so many of the <br/>\ninteractions between them. They need a witness to keep them honest! They <br/>\nneed even more of our energy.

And they were children of those  <br/>\nparents, having been adopted, but clearly they weren&#39;t quite as much  <br/>\nas those who were called by their names.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were in a playgroup and the kids visited back and forth when they  <br/>\nwere little, and we lost contact, but in the past few years &quot;the  <br/>\nlittle Russian girl&quot; (we use her name but I won&#39;t here) resurfaced in  <br/>\nmy boys&#39; lives.  She was working in one of the places Kirby worked.    <br/>\nShe still felt floatily displaced, and like a foster child ore than  <br/>\nan adoptee.  Or maybe it was that she figured as soon as she could be  <br/>\nout of that house she&#39;d be gone.  And she wasn&#39;t making the best  <br/>\ndecisions, when she was newly out.  She&#39;d been told what to do and  <br/>\nhow all those years AND reminded several times a day that she was  <br/>\nadopted.  She was constantly referred to and treated as a Russian  <br/>\nchild adopted by a noble American family.  Labelled like a monkey at  <br/>\nthe zoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby would have been labelled, if he had gone to school at five.  He  <br/>\njust wasn&#39;t ready for school yet, but there are names for that, so  <br/>\nthey can get funding for that, and so the teachers can say &quot;I would  <br/>\nhave taught him to read but he&#39;s XYZ,&quot; or &quot;We told him to sit down  <br/>\nand be quiet, but he&#39;s ABC.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty would have been labelled if he had gone to school.   He&#39;s left- <br/>\nhanded, that&#39;s obvious.  But there are attributes often associated  <br/>\nwith left-handedness in boys, and rather than just assume that  <br/>\nlefties might have those other traits, they name the other traits and  <br/>\ntreat them as a &quot;condition.&quot;  Well his &quot;condition&quot; is that he&#39;s just  <br/>\nlike hundreds of thousands of other lefty-boys his age.  Math will be  <br/>\neasier than reading for all of them.  Big deal.  It doesn&#39;t need &quot;the  <br/>\nD word.&quot;  (Duh.)  But schools are NOT set up to treat children as  <br/>\nindividuals, and increasingly they&#39;re set up to treat children as  <br/>\naberrations, as diseases, as pathologies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling works the same way for every child.  To sort your  <br/>\nchildren out into gifted and challenged and ADHD or ADD (carefully  <br/>\nnoting the differences) and dyslexic and intense and explosive and  <br/>\nsensitive and  introverted and spectrum, or if you want to lean  <br/>\ntoward indigo, old-soul, psychic or changeling... it&#39;s all counter- <br/>\nproductive to unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to think about your child&#39;s learning preferences and  <br/>\ntalents look here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/intelligences\">http://sandradodd.com/intelligences</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t use it to label them.

Just about EVERY list or discussion about kids dealing with any<br/>\nlabel, are really INTO those labels, finding labels for kids and<br/>\ntrying to &quot;fix&quot; the child rather than adapt the parenting style and<br/>\nenvironment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hate to even bring this up, because I&#39;m honestly tired of seeing<br/>\npeople through labels of any &quot;disability&quot; or &quot;disorder&quot;. I think what<br/>\nwe as a society consider &quot;normal&quot; is what&#39;s screwed up. BUT, my<br/>\nyoungest child would have definitely been labeled &quot;on the spectrum&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow would I know this? We chose to do some Neuro-feedback (like<br/>\nbiofeedback but a lot more therapeutic) about a year ago. It was done<br/>\nby a close friend who supports our parenting style 100% and is very<br/>\npatient and gentle with my son when he&#39;s melting down or being intense<br/>\nin some manner.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe intake form she did was VERY thorough. It took me about two hours<br/>\nto go through it with her (without my child there). The psychologist<br/>\nmentoring her during this process confirmed my suspicions that he<br/>\nwould have been labeled &quot;Aspergers&quot; or something &quot;on the spectrum&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never sought that opinion. Mary knew I had done research and needed<br/>\nto understand my child to better support his needs. I had taken my<br/>\npersonal research to her as a friend who understood how I NEVER, EVER<br/>\nwanted to seek out a &quot;fix&quot; or label him in any way. So in the end, I<br/>\ndid get a professional opinion that he would be diagnosed with exactly<br/>\nwhat I suspected.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only reason the research even happened was in an effort for ME to<br/>\nlearn and grow and understand how to support my child. It was so<br/>\nimportant at one phase in our journey. <br/>\n<br/>\nRather than trying to make him fit the environment, we try to create<br/>\nenvironments in which he can fully blossom. As he gets older, his<br/>\nintensities lessen, he finds more coping tools and things get better<br/>\nfor him. Just like all of us. I have a feeling that most of what would<br/>\nhave gotten labeled in him, will have disappeared by the time he&#39;s an<br/>\nadult. All that therapy and crap that gets shoved on these kids can do<br/>\na lot of damage to their sense of self....which is HUGE.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Neurofeedback lasted a few sessions, he decided he was done with<br/>\nit and we didn&#39;t pursue it again. He now asks Mary if he can play the<br/>\n&quot;brain games&quot; when he&#39;s at her house sometimes. They helped him feel<br/>\nreally calm and soothed. I did it with him and I loved how soothing it<br/>\nwas. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the entire point of this is so that in a discussion like this<br/>\npeople can&#39;t say &quot;oh, you just don&#39;t understand&quot;.

Yes, I found the label <br/>\nimmensely helpful because it gave me a focus for research to learn <br/>\nmore about how my son might think differently than my other two <br/>\nchildren.  But I rarely use that label anymore because I can describe <br/>\nJeffrey in other ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s say I&#39;m participating in a conversation about kids and video <br/>\ngames.  Using the label as a description, I might say that Jeffrey <br/>\ncan spend hours in front of the video game because his Aspergers <br/>\nmakes him an introvert and gives him a very narrow focus.  Without <br/>\nthe label, I would say that Jeffrey has a passion for playing his <br/>\nvideo games that brings him great joy.  He gets into his games so <br/>\nmuch that he likes to be alone when playing so he can give them all <br/>\nhis focus and energy.  The label tends to give a negative slant <br/>\ntoward the child, whether intended or not.  It&#39;s like saying, &#39;Oh I <br/>\nknow this isn&#39;t normal and good but my child has XYZ so we can&#39;t help <br/>\nit.&#39;  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for resources, I don&#39;t see why those couldn&#39;t be discussed here, <br/>\nunless it&#39;s a disguised way of saying that special needs kids need <br/>\nparticular curriculum.  I do understand that some people need <br/>\ndifferent ways of learning things but I still believe that should be <br/>\nlooked at in an individual way.  Perhaps someone is thinking their <br/>\nchild is frustrated because they are expressing a desire to learn to <br/>\nread but it&#39;s not coming as natural as they had hoped.  Maybe the <br/>\nparent could post that their child wants to learn to read without <br/>\nfollowing a phonics method, or without following a whole word method, <br/>\nor whatever.  Posed to the list in that specific way, people might <br/>\nhave some suggestions to help.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd lastly, personality differences will be and should be noticed in <br/>\nevery individual.  My son&#39;s personality does not need to be described <br/>\nor categorized by a label.  My daughters&#39; personalities aren&#39;t <br/>\ndefined that way.

This is<br/>\nthe moderator&#39;s right, as she is the list owner.  I believe that these<br/>\nposts would be of interest/value to many in the AlwaysLearningGroup.<br/>\nTherefore, I have created a group<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/RawAlwaysLearning/)\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/RawAlwaysLearning/)</a> where<br/>\nAlwaysLearning members may post and discuss posts/topics which have<br/>\nbeen rejected by this list.  Join us!<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the first post to the RawAlwaysLearning group, which seems to<br/>\nhave been rejected by the moderator of the AlwaysLearningGroup:<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************************************************ <br/>\n************<br/>\n<br/>\nThat list was started today and has four members.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral things about this are irritating, but chief among them is  <br/>\nnaming the list to match the name of this list.  It&#39;s like stalking.   <br/>\nIf you want to create a list, do it!  But to create a list based on  <br/>\nthis one is not healthy, good or right.   A few years back someone  <br/>\nwho was angry at the moderators of UnschoolingDiscussion created a  <br/>\nlist called UnschoolingDiscussions, and solicited members from that  <br/>\nlist (and certainly hoped to catch accidental traffic).  The list  <br/>\nlasted a while on badmouthing me and others specifically.  What kind  <br/>\nof basis is that for a list?  It&#39;s discourteous at best.  (And  <br/>\nthey&#39;ve had two posts in all of 2008 so far, so their thought they  <br/>\ncould do better seems not to have been true.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is quite overstated:<br/>\n&quot;As you know, this group is actively moderated, such that many posts<br/>\nare rejected by the moderator, and the group never sees them. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are not many posts rejected and there are several moderators.   <br/>\nMost of the posts rejected lately were purely nasty spam, and  <br/>\nphishing sales sites.  You WANT moderation; seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- I believe that these posts would be of interest/value to many in  <br/>\nthe AlwaysLearningGroup. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;These posts&quot;?  There are not &quot;many&quot; of them.   So far, that list is  <br/>\ndiscussing ONE post, which I don&#39;t think I rejected.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so I would like to ask that anyone who is unhappy with the list  <br/>\neither complain to me or just go happily to another list.  Don&#39;t send  <br/>\nside e-mails to list members stating untruths and inviting them away  <br/>\nfrom the list.  What a rude, tacky waste of time and energy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever topics ANYone wants to discuss, there are countless places  <br/>\non the web to discuss them.  This list is not and isn&#39;t trying to be  <br/>\nanyone&#39;s be-all and end-all. Be on as many different lists as you  <br/>\nwant to be on to discuss all the things you want, but I do NOT  <br/>\nappreciate someone creating a counter-list, a critical list, a list  <br/>\nabout my list.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith this, I am asking that the creator of RawAlwaysLearning delete  <br/>\nthat list from yahoogroups and stop contacting the members of this  <br/>\nlist.  Don&#39;t even whine or apologize.  Just stop.  People have gotten  <br/>\nenough unsolicited mail about it already.  If you want to have  <br/>\nanother list, don&#39;t name it anything like &quot;AlwaysLearning&quot; and if you  <br/>\nwant to solicit members from this list do it in a post to the list,  <br/>\nnot with side mail.
