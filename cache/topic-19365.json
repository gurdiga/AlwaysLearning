There are most likely those who use porn who do not behave <br/>\nthat way.<br/>\nWhat causes it then I wonder? -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it has to do with wholeness and self esteem.<br/>\nThose who are obsessed with attention-getting about a topic that seems itself <br/>\nthe ultimate in attention-getting are needy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nChildren who have no void inside them don&#39;t need to fill their void.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren with a void cram any old crap in there.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooled kids do not tend to be needy of attention or respect or positive <br/>\nregard.<br/>\n<br/>\nA kid whose parents and teachers think he&#39;s irritating and bad might be made <br/>\nto feel more soothed and good by porn, or being obnoxious, or cutting his desk <br/>\nor his arm.  Why not do what he wants?  People hate him already.<br/>\n<br/>\nA kid whose parents show him REAL, honest regard and a kid who knows the <br/>\ngoodness in him because he gets chances to use it in real ways and be recognized <br/>\nwhen he uses it won&#39;t feel that he&#39;ll be MORE real/honest/good if he sees porn <br/>\nthan if he doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking of real people as I&#39;m writing this, and the worst nasty-mouth <br/>\nboy we know has the greatest voids in his life.  His dad has been in prison <br/>\nnearly all or all his life; his mom had another baby by someone else, and he&#39;s had <br/>\nto take care of that boy more often than ANY brother should have to take care <br/>\nof a child not much younger than himself, and his mom has a string of loser <br/>\nboyfriends.  This is a friend of Marty&#39;s.  He&#39;s been in school and out, but he <br/>\nprefers in, because he needs an audience, and he needs the thrill of <br/>\nacceptance and rejection.  He needs bustle and input all the time.  They put him on <br/>\nritalin so his grades would be better.  He said it  makes his brain numb.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe has his dad&#39;s genetics and his mom&#39;s too.  He&#39;s been neglected.  Loved in <br/>\nsome real ways, but inconsistent ways.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe needs porn.  But the porn didn&#39;t come first.<br/>\nThe idea that someone would pay intimate total attention to him is really an <br/>\nimportant fantasy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve written two essays which don&#39;t touch on porn in any way whatsoever, but <br/>\nI&#39;m going to list them here for anyone who&#39;s thinking maybe that I&#39;m full of <br/>\nnonsense-beans.

A couple weeks later I noticed that<br/>\nwhen I would walk into the kitchen (where the computer was) latish at<br/>\nnight he would turn the computer off suddenly.  This happened a couple<br/>\ntimes.  I checked the history and he was doing searches for things like<br/>\nwoman sucking man&#39;s penis, boobs, woman having sex with man, etc.  I<br/>\nfelt like I had exposed him to something inappropriate.  I had a very<br/>\ncalm conversation about it with him where I said that it was normal and<br/>\nnatural to want to look at porn but that it was really meant for older<br/>\npeople.  Inside I was a little freaked though.  My husband talked to him<br/>\nand told him that if he wanted to look at it anymore, that he would look<br/>\nat it with him so that he could help him understand it.  The next couple<br/>\nweeks, I checked periodically and he was still doing the same searches.<br/>\nSo I put Cyber Sitter on all the computers.<br/>\nI guess I&#39;m afraid.  My mom is a sex addict who left my dad to have sex<br/>\nwith lots of people, and attended Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous.  My<br/>\nson&#39;s biological father is also a sex addict who is obsessed with porn.<br/>\nBoth these people were also drug addicts.  I know that porn can be<br/>\naddictive and can ruin relationships (had nothing to do with the ruin of<br/>\nours since we were together all of two weeks).  I know that some girls<br/>\ncan&#39;t handle being with men who enjoy porn because they feel competitive<br/>\nabout it.  I personally don&#39;t have issues with porn and have enjoyed it<br/>\nat different times in my life.  But it freaked me out to think of my 8<br/>\ny.o. looking at it.<br/>\nSo what do you think?  Was it stupid to put Cyber Sitter on?  Is it<br/>\nnormal for an 8 y.o. to want to keep looking at it?  If it was just a<br/>\nstumbled across it and then went on to something else it wouldn&#39;t be an<br/>\nissue, but he felt the need to keep looking and search for more and hide<br/>\nit from us.  It worries me.  Addiction runs rampant in my family.  Also<br/>\nI teach junior high and the boys who obviously spend time looking at<br/>\nporn are little perverts who think/talk about nothing else than female<br/>\nbody parts and the use of them and can&#39;t seem to think of the girls as<br/>\nactual people.

I have a daughter that refuses to watch &quot;tear-jerker&quot; type movies because she doesn&#39;t like that feeling.  My kids (11ds, 9dd) know what pornagraphy is and they know they don&#39;t want to look at it (this year, at least).  They figured out what spam looked like (all spam) and learned how to either avoid it or delete it without looking at it.   Partly because I know they don&#39;t want to see porn and warned them about it.   I think a lot of what was posted about violence in movies applies to the porn issue.
