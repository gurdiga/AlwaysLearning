I&#39;ve been avidly reading what you <br/>\nhave all written because I&#39;m already getting a lot of pressure from <br/>\nfamily about Aislinn and her inability and complete disinterest in <br/>\nreading and writing.  It&#39;s so comforting to hear about everyone else&#39;s <br/>\nchildren.  Aislinn&#39;s only 7 and busy living her life which doesn&#39;t, at <br/>\nthis point, involve writing or reading.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy dh understands what unschooling is, but doesn&#39;t wholeheartedly agree. <br/>\n Last week he told Aislinn (when I wasn&#39;t around) that he wanted to sit <br/>\nwith her at night and work on her reading.  Aislinn told me about it and <br/>\nI asked her how she felt about it and she said it was okay.  But Aislinn <br/>\nwould say that if she thought she should even if it wasn&#39;t true (a sad <br/>\nfact of the way our life used to be).  The thing is...my dh spends so <br/>\nlittle time with the girls that part of me feels maybe it wouldn&#39;t be a <br/>\nbad thing.  I asked him about it and he said he felt she needed to start <br/>\nworking harder on it.  I asked him if he was going to do this with both <br/>\nolder girls because Elysia not only wants to do EVERYTHING Aislinn does, <br/>\nElysia is actually more inclined to write stuff and can write more than <br/>\nAislinn can.  Elysia is 5.  Dh said he only wanted to work with Aislinn <br/>\nbecause she&#39;ll just feel bad if Elysia&#39;s quicker about it than her.  I <br/>\nagree with that, but he can&#39;t tell Elysia to just go away when it&#39;s <br/>\nsomething she&#39;s interested in.  I don&#39;t know what to do.  Probably I <br/>\nwon&#39;t have to do anything, because I doubt dh will do anything. <br/>\n Unfortunately it&#39;s these little episodes that, I think, make Aislinn <br/>\nless interested in writing (and reading) because she closes down when <br/>\npressured.  To keep commenting on her inability to read is like jabbing <br/>\nat her and then walking away.  Oh...if only everyone would just let it <br/>\ngo and try to understand more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all for your stories about your children.  I&#39;m printing them <br/>\nto make a little booklet.
