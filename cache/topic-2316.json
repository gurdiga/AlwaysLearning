I was looking<br/>\nfor the mysterious Santa Fe Staircase and I found it inside a tiny chapel in<br/>\nthe heart of Santa Fe.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe staircase is strange because of two reasons.  The first being the<br/>\nstrange man that built it.  The second reason being that according to many<br/>\nengineers and carpenters it is a marvel of engineering.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe story of the staircase is as follows.  Inside the tiny chapel there is a<br/>\nchoir loft in the back.  This loft is ten or twelve feet above the floor of<br/>\nthe chapel and when the place was new, the choir had to climb up a shaky<br/>\nladder to go up into the loft to sing.  It was getting to the point where<br/>\nmany of the members were refusing to climb up the rickety ladder into the<br/>\nloft to sing on sunday morning.  The women of the church were distraught and<br/>\ngathered one day to pray to God for a solution.  Some days later, a<br/>\nmysterious stranger came out of the desert.  A man no one knew, yet he said<br/>\nthat God had sent him to build them a staircase.  He set to work on it with<br/>\nonly a hammer and saw and nothing else, except for a giant tub of hot water.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s so very strange about this spiral staircase is the fact that it was<br/>\nbuilt with only a hammer and saw and that there are no nails in the entire<br/>\nwork.  I got as close as I could to this piece of craftsmanship to examine<br/>\nit thoroughly.  I can tell you first hand that I couldn&#39;t even find a single<br/>\npeg.  It looks as though it was carved out of one gigantic block of wood.<br/>\nAnother thing about the staircase is that it is absolutely beautiful.  I<br/>\nstood there in awe of the sheer aesthetic value of<br/>\nthis expertly crafted wonder.  I wish I had one just like it in my home.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome say the man who came out of the desert to build the spiral staircase<br/>\nwas none other than Jesus himself.  The carpenter of carpenters.  In fact<br/>\nthe descriptions that were written about the man say that he indeed looked<br/>\nlike Christ.  Who knows?  As soon as he had finished with it, he disappeared<br/>\nwithout a trace and no one ever heard from him again.  Some say that the man<br/>\nwas an angel sent from God.<br/>\n<br/>\nScientists, engineers and carpenters come from all over the world to examine<br/>\nthis spiral staircase.  Many of them say that by all rights the staircase<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t even be able to hold up it&#39;s own weight, much less hold the weight<br/>\nof thousands of people climbing up and down its steps for well over a<br/>\nhundred years.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re ever in Santa Fe, I urge you to visit the tiny chapel and witness<br/>\nfor yourself this beautiful and mysterious wonder and, while you there, go<br/>\nto a nearby restaurant and dine on the best southwestern cuisine you ever<br/>\ntasted!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;The Mowery Family&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jkkddmowery@...\">jkkddmowery@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, January 08, 2002 6:10 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] spiral staircase in Santa Fe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hey, that story was just a lifetime movie(I think).
