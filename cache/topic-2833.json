I don&#39;t know if Roman Catholic<br/>\nchurches still do this, or if Anglican or other &quot;traditional&quot; Christian<br/>\ncommunions do, maybe someone else can say, but Eastern Orthodox altars have<br/>\nrelics encased within.  Ideally, they will belong to the saint to whom the<br/>\nchurch is dedicated, although one imagines St. George has been distributed a<br/>\nfew more times than a normal skeleton would allow.  I used to attend a Greek<br/>\nmission parish dedicated to St. Gregory of Nyssa, who, though very important<br/>\nin eastern theology, does not have many churches named for him.  Our bishop<br/>\nused to joke that when it came time to consecrate our own church building,<br/>\nhe&#39;d go to Greece and bring back a whole arm.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Just Friday I was talking with someone I&#39;ve known a long time whose husband&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; family is from northern New Mexico, where I grew up.   The daughter who is 13<br/>\n&gt; now went to a Hispanic art musuem and was unable to get close to a couple of<br/>\n&gt; the colonial santos--the carved and painted figures of saints.   I told her<br/>\n&gt; mom that there were a couple in the old Catholic church in Santa Cruz that<br/>\n&gt; used to give me the physical creeps--not their appearance, which was fine,<br/>\n&gt; but the standing in the place right in front of them, getting creepy feelings<br/>\n&gt; of the people who had stood there before, and how much serious energy had<br/>\n&gt; been poured out in the directions of those figures over a couple of hundred<br/>\n&gt; of years--silent guilt and remorse and terror, and it felt like that.  Not<br/>\n&gt; all over the church, but in certain spots.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know about the creepy feelings people get, but statuary and icons<br/>\nare also sometimes used as reliquaries.  When I visited England in 1999, it<br/>\nwas a little disconcerting at first to realize the cathedral floor was a<br/>\ngraveyard, and that there really were people in those sarcophagi.<br/>\nChichester Cathedral was very thought-provoking; they had a section of floor<br/>\nremoved and covered with glass so you could see the ancient Roman mosaic<br/>\nbeneath, and in another section we stumbled across the tomb of composer<br/>\nGustav Holst, alongside medieval nobles.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There might be explanations for that in the flow of the air in the building.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are feelings and cross-miles communications that could have<br/>\n&gt; explanations someday without proving the existence of multiple lifetimes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My papaw, my mom&#39;s mom, who was NOT a superstitious or sentimental guy, who<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t have trouble sleeping, got up and sat in his kitchen looking out the<br/>\n&gt; window the night his mother died, and he sat looking out, he says, and other<br/>\n&gt; witnesses at the time, until he saw his relatives coming by wagon, the next<br/>\n&gt; morning, to tell him his mother had died just at the time he had suddenly<br/>\n&gt; awakened and started to sit.   He wasn&#39;t the kind of guy to get up, nor the<br/>\n&gt; kind of guy to worry, so ther&#39;s no alternative explanation like &quot;he probably<br/>\n&gt; had gotten up like that fifteen times and once his mom happened to die.&quot;  His<br/>\n&gt; mom wasn&#39;t sick and expected to die, I don&#39;t think.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>The day my childhood friend Kristin&#39;s dad died, I felt really odd and<br/>\npanicky, and I bought a houseplant and a cockatiel; I had this powerful urge<br/>\nto get living things into my room.  I knew he&#39;d been in the hospital, but<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know he&#39;d passed away until later that night.
