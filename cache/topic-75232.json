Julie, James and Adam Daniel came from England at their own expense, helped with unloading and setup, take-down and packing up.  Very generous.  Hema Bharadwaj was generous with time and knowledge and attention from beginning to end!<br/>\n<br/>\nJust before that, too late in the year, really, I asked for assistance.   I&#39;ve received about three dozen cards, and some exotic ones, too!  Lots of glitter, lots of photos of happy families with unschooled kids.  THANK YOU.  Over fifty families or individuals donated funds for my website, chat room, google search (without ads, just my site), and to help us get over 50 *other* people up to Sandia Crest by tram.  So it was a busy week, lots of correspondence, and me not being home and not sleeping enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still working on some of the thank-you notes, but thought others might want to see that thank-you art I ordered from fiverr.com.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone sorry to have missed this year&#39;s gathering up might want to put a note on the calendar for November 2015, when I plan to ask again (perhapsâ€”and if I don&#39;t, spend that money on your kids!!).<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/2014/request\">http://sandradodd.com/2014/request</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThis ties in to recent discussions of whether pink was a girlie color in India (it is not), and of Holly being in homes in India, and Indian cloth, and special effects, and videos on webpages...  <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for sharing links to my site out with others, and for sharing your lives with others, too, so they can see families being more patient and peaceful than most foiks expect families to be, with children.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHappy 2015!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75198,"nextTopicId":75216}}
