My<br/>\nfirst was an emergency c, as I was in a car accident and Haley had gripped<br/>\nher cord so tightly she had very little oxygen, they waited and hoped I<br/>\nwould go into labor because her due date was just 5 days away.  They did a<br/>\nvertical cut.  With my next child my blood pressure spiked up and down, I<br/>\nhad 2 weeks till the due date and this doctor went in a panic on one of my<br/>\nvisits and decided to do a c the next morning.  He said he was afraid my bp<br/>\nwould spike too high during labor and cause a stroke?.. I dont&#39; know if any<br/>\nof this would have happened.. My third child I had another new doctor who<br/>\ngave me a choice, but I was once again gullable and let my mom talk me into<br/>\nanother c-section because she was nervous, plus I already knew what to<br/>\nexpect :(.  With my 4th child, my doctor said the chance was too high that<br/>\nmy baby would drown in blood if my uterus ripped while in labor, so I never<br/>\ngot to experience even labor.  All I can do is share my experiences.  I had<br/>\nall c&#39;s, but if I could go back I would have tried vbacs with the last 3. <br/>\nBut I do have 4 very healthy children, so at this point it doesn&#39;t really<br/>\nmatter to me how they got here. :-) .  I couldn&#39;t tell you which way to go<br/>\nwith it as it is such a personal thing/feeling/instinct.  And ask around<br/>\nsome more?\r<br/>\ntammy\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n*************I wanted a vbac with my last two but doctors said no. I do<br/>\nwonder if I would \r<br/>\nhave done ok with one. My first was 7.5 almost c-section and the last two \r<br/>\nwhere c&#39;s. They where 10-12 and 9-4. We have been trying for another and I \r<br/>\nwould like to go vbac. Doctors keep telling me that if I go Vbac it could \r<br/>\nkill me or the baby.
