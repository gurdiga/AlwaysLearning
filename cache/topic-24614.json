Gee, you&#39;re a <br/>\nreeeeal pain in the ........  no, just kidding I wouldn&#39;t even say that <br/>\neither.<br/>\n<br/>\n I always enjoy everything you write. I do get many chuckles and I appreciate <br/>\nthat in a person. I sometimes will forward things to my dh so he can be <br/>\nenlightened also. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>\nThe &quot;Fallacies&quot; page is a funny one. We are sort of new to unschooling, heck, <br/>\nwe&#39;re new to hs&#39;ing too. I can&#39;t believe how far we have come though. I am <br/>\nsoooo happy to see our dd&#39;s start to relax and enjoy all that life has to offer <br/>\nthem. It&#39;s amazing how much happier our life has become. Not that it was real <br/>\nbad or anything, it&#39;s just better than ever! So much more peaceful! Our oldest <br/>\nused have acne all the time and she was only 11. We pulled them out of ps a <br/>\nlittle over a year ago, she&#39;s 12 now. A few months ago she said &quot;Hey Mom! I <br/>\ndon&#39;t really have acne any more! I&#39;ve been noticing it since I left school! Man I <br/>\nLOVE this unschooling stuff!&quot; Ahhhh..... no more forced learning, degrading <br/>\nteachers, bullies, grades, begging to get a drink of water or simply go to the <br/>\nbathroom etc.!<br/>\n<br/>\n From, another fan of &quot;The Holy Grail&quot; &lt;BG!&gt; My dh and I rented that on our <br/>\nfirst date 18 yrs ago:o) Our daughters are getting the accent down pretty good <br/>\nthese days, they take after their Dad sooo much. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy<br/>\ncheck out my art at!<br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.picturetrail.com/nancysart&quot;\">http://www.picturetrail.com/nancysart&quot;</a>&gt;PictureTrail&lt;/A&gt;  or <br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://carverscompanion.com/Ezine/Vol9Issue3/KMenendez/KMenendez2.html&quot;\">http://carverscompanion.com/Ezine/Vol9Issue3/KMenendez/KMenendez2.html&quot;</a>&gt;Woodcarver On-Line Magazine, Pyrography News, No. 34&lt;/A&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24611,"nextTopicId":24619}}
