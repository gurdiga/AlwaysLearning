But high school (public vs. the<br/>\nprivate I HAD BEEN attending) was a much more free environment for me,<br/>\nwith more people, different kinds of teachers, and more subjects that<br/>\nopened up interesting discussions for me.

Maybe that incident sowed the seeds of more than<br/>\njust idle curiosity, I don&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was very involved with all four of my daughter&#39;s schools (two in the<br/>\nUK, two in Australia), but I was seldom in the classroom getting a<br/>\nview of the teaching, and my daughter was always amongst the<br/>\n&#39;frontrunners&#39; in every class she was in, so there was no cause for<br/>\nconcern. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat all changed when her ten years younger brother started school.<br/>\nEspecially in his second year - 2002 - when he was becoming<br/>\nprogressively unhappier. By then, I was in the school every day, at<br/>\nthe very least for morning assembly, often helping out in some way in<br/>\nthe classroom. And by this time, the internet had become a part of my<br/>\ndaily life. A fantastic learning resource. Taken advantage of daily by<br/>\nme and by my son. So, whenever I got into my son&#39;s classroom, I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t help but notice the amount of fluff and padding in a typical<br/>\nschool day, more consciously than I&#39;d never noticed it before. I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t help but notice that it was taking an hour to teach my son<br/>\nwhat he could learn for himself in two minutes. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter my son had asked to be taken out of school, my wife and I were<br/>\npondering on that for quite a while. Then one day I was once again in<br/>\nhis classroom, helping out with some mathematics project or other. And<br/>\nI&#39;m sitting there and suddenly I realise, &quot;Gosh, this is like<br/>\noccupational therapy. It&#39;s basket weaving.&quot; (&quot;Gosh&quot; wasn&#39;t the actual<br/>\nword that sprang to mind). That was the end of my efforts to help my<br/>\nson adapt to school culture. It wasn&#39;t until about seven weeks later<br/>\nthat it happened for real, but he was out of there from that moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI prefer my son to learn at the speed of thought not wait around for<br/>\nsomebody to teach him at the speed of watching paint dry. That&#39;s how<br/>\nit was, and is, and will always be.<br/>\n<br/>\nBob<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Perhaps I should have added &quot;Amen&quot; to that. :-)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":327905838,"authorName":"hollywoodapi","from":"&quot;hollywoodapi&quot; &lt;anna@...&gt;","profile":"hollywoodapi","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Schooling: The Hidden Agenda - Daniel Quinn","postDate":"1223762778","msgId":39364,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdjcjgwcStqNGp0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":39396,"prevInTime":39363,"nextInTime":39365,"topicId":39364,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Dear All, I have been organizing by office for days and came across a handout.
