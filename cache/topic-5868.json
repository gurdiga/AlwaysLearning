I was all set to go in April when I realized that I had signed <br/>\nConor up for a class on designing web pages during that time. (Conor has <br/>\nbeen wanting to learn. He liked the class idea BTW)<br/>\n<br/>\nI sent a frantic email to Jon (my dh) to solicit his advice. Would Conor <br/>\nfreak out if he got behind in the class, should I postpone or maybe cancel a <br/>\nreally cool trip, should we talk to the reacher and find out what he will <br/>\nmiss....? Obviously I should talk to Conor, but what did he think???!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the wonderfully calming wise note I received back.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;He can always take another web design class. In fact it is assured that he <br/>\n&gt;&gt;will be taking another one if he has any interest anyway, because it&#39;s not <br/>\n&gt;&gt;like one little class is going to teach him anything beyond the barest <br/>\n&gt;&gt;basics.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t sweat it about missing one, even though we spent 8 million <br/>\ndollars on it...&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAhhh, my sweet and wonderful high-school drop-out hubby.
