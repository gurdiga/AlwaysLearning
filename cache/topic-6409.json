For those who don t know, a delimber sits on","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-712923430\">We were up at five AM.<br/>\nDylan&#39;s father is a heavy equipment operator.  Today he had a job running<br/>\na delimber.<br/>\nFor those who don&#39;t know, a delimber sits on tracks or a flat bed and has<br/>\na long boom with front and back grapple hooks, a swinging butt plate and<br/>\na front and rear saw.  It is designed to pick up trees, remove all the<br/>\nlimbs and cut the log to the proper length.   <br/>\nIt was an interesting job because it was a local private land owner who<br/>\nhas a select cut every year and it was located in Gold Creek, MT.  site<br/>\nof an 1862 gold dredging operation that left huge, vast mounds of river<br/>\nrock for miles and miles.   At the time of the gold discovery the<br/>\nlandscape was decimated by gold mining operations. <br/>\nDouglas fir and lodge pole have been growing there for about 102 years<br/>\nnow.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a low impact select cut which means, basically, not a clear cut. <br/>\nThe land owner is not a lumber corporation, but a fourth generation MT<br/>\nnative who uses the lumber sale to pay his property taxes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAll this said, you can&#39;t believe the mess.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDylan sat in and ran the delimber for about thirty minutes and he seems<br/>\nto have his dad&#39;s skill at operating.  He said it was just like<br/>\nPlaystation. ( for those of you wondering what video games will do for<br/>\nkids )   Then we watched his dad tear through this deck of trees ( the<br/>\ntrees were all hand felled and skidded into a pile )<br/>\nwhile we talked about why someone would cut trees.  His dad can de limb,<br/>\ncut and deck a log about every twelve seconds, for perspective.  While we<br/>\ntalked the truck driver showed up, in a self loader, to take the logs to<br/>\nthe mill.  He let Dylan climb into the loader seat, located above and<br/>\nbehind the cab, and swing the boom around.  He wouldn&#39;t let him load,<br/>\nmumbling something about not wanting a log shoved through his cab.  We<br/>\nwatched him load logs onto his truck, which he did in thirty minutes,<br/>\nstart to finish.  Dylan sang the Lumberjack song from Monty Python to his<br/>\ndad over the radio. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe counted rings on logs.  The oldest tree we found was seventy two, a<br/>\nDouglas fir, about twenty four inches in diameter. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe climbed the mounds of boulders from years of dredging.  We talked<br/>\nabout gold and greed and impact and reclamation.  We had a fir cone<br/>\nfight.  We saw a rattle snake, we saw white tail deer who are so nosey<br/>\nthey came right to the deck to check us out.  We saw bear scat, but no<br/>\nbear.   We hiked,  we rode in a log truck,  we had a memorial ceremony<br/>\nfor the dead trees.  We found a mouse head with no mouse.   We found a<br/>\nshady bank of snow and made angels.  We pulled wood ticks off our socks. <br/>\nWe climbed on the remains of an old sluice and part of the original<br/>\ndredge, now half submerged in a dredge pond.   We found a cow skull.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we came home we ate peanut butter and jelly and went to Karate where<br/>\nDylan sparred everyone in the class, and learned a new kata.  He talked<br/>\nwith his instructor about Ki and they tested each other&#39;s inner strength<br/>\nin a game where all the students line up one behind the other and try to<br/>\npush over one student who is focusing his Ki.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe came home and found a package from friends in Arkansas filled with<br/>\ndried mushrooms, okra, mud dauber nests, persimmon seeds, acorns, sweet<br/>\ngum seeds, organic popcorn  and pictures of salamanders.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe wrote an e-mail to the green party, which he joined two months ago,<br/>\nand volunteered to collect signatures for a ballot initiative to buy back<br/>\nMontana&#39;s hydro electric plants.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s eating popcorn and watching Spartacus.  He says he wants a chariot<br/>\nfor his tenth birthday, or a sling shot.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s almost 8:30 PM on a day that started with only a vague plan to be at<br/>\nthe dojo on time.   We have no plans for tomorrow  but it will be worlds<br/>\nbetter than a desk and math book, what ever it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6416,"nextTopicId":6418}}
