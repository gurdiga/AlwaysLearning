Someone has entirely too much time on their hands!!! Or too <br/>\ncreative maybe?<br/>\nOh, that&#39;s right. You&#39;re unschoolers...you have an abundance of BOTH!!! Cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome Cathy,<br/>\nI thought I was Christian too....beginning to think I will convert to being a <br/>\nHoltie.<br/>\nLOL!<br/>\nI&#39;m still chuckling...geez, you guys are so funny.<br/>\nSure, you can be an unschooler and Christian...in that order. Just kidding.<br/>\nI guess I&#39;m a little leery of a lot of people that say Christian/unschooling <br/>\nin the same breath because of many forms of control I see Christians using on <br/>\ntheir kids...all in the name of God/religion, which bothers me.<br/>\nI don&#39;t think that&#39;s what Christ was all about anyway.<br/>\nI love Jesus, I love what he taught, I love reading about him.<br/>\nSo I claim Christianity.<br/>\nYou aren&#39;t alone.  But I am not any one &quot;brand&quot; of Christian....so it&#39;s hard <br/>\nto fit in sometimes. Which obviously bothers me a lot (using sarcastic voice).<br/>\nI think there are some benefits to starting a Church of Holt here <br/>\nfolks..,....but first I want to see the robes. Being a makeup consultant, I <br/>\nhave to make sure it looks good on me!!! haha<br/>\nLove your quote Patricia!<br/>\nI gave my mom a little painting with a quote &quot;who walks the world with soul <br/>\nawake finds beauty everywhere&quot;<br/>\nI think it&#39;s a Frost quote? Can&#39;t remember now.<br/>\nAnyway, it&#39;s a great line you posted.<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1766,"nextTopicId":1691}}
