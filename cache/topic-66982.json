Or at least reassure you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy now 32 year old oldest (who it turns out actually does have some nerve<br/>\ndeafness issues) did not &quot;speak English&quot; until he was past three.    We<br/>\nworried about his hearing as an infant for several reasons (including<br/>\ngenetic) so at age 2 had him tested at a regional speech and hearing<br/>\ncenter.   Their diagnosis was that though he had some mild hearing lack of<br/>\nhigh frequencies it should not affect the conversational range.  30 years<br/>\nago both the technology as well as knowledge about conversational sounds<br/>\nwas different than today!.   His speech eval showed a passive language of<br/>\nwell past 4 years but an active language of 8 months.   They recommended<br/>\nextensive therapy but because we lived in a rural area nearly 3 hours away<br/>\nit was recognized that 3-5 days a week was an impossibility. I did make<br/>\nsome trips to a different regional center a little over an hour another<br/>\ndirection from us and they were going to come up with a home program for us<br/>\nto do.  But I did not agree at all with the first directives they suggested<br/>\nand by the time weeks later that they mailed out a home program he had<br/>\nstarted talking in sentences. (about age 2 years, 6 months)   No one could<br/>\nunderstand him except the family until he was about 5 and even at 7 and 8<br/>\nhis speech was a little &quot;funny&quot;.  I might not have even done the initial<br/>\nevaluations but he was very frustrated with not being able to communicate<br/>\nwith others.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can hear him speak now at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.datastax.com/2011/07/video-data-modeling-workshop-from-cassandra-sf-2011\">http://www.datastax.com/2011/07/video-data-modeling-workshop-from-cassandra-sf-2011</a><br/>\nor google Matt Dennis Oscon for various videos.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe talks way too fast for me but I don&#39;t think anyone would suggest that<br/>\nthe lack of extensive speech therapy prevented him from ever learning to<br/>\ncommunicate orally in English!.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis children would have been considered late talkers with enunciation<br/>\nproblems.  His daughter was very patient in trying to train adults to<br/>\nunderstand her.  Her speech started clearning about age 4 and now at 6  1/2<br/>\nyears she can wear you out with extensive conversation and very &quot;advanced&quot;<br/>\nvocabulary. My biased grandma view is that she speaks clearer than the<br/>\n&quot;baby&quot; talk of many 6 year olds.   I will add that strangers always think<br/>\nshe is older and express surprise at both her speech and vocabulary.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe say that his 4 year old son doesn&#39;t have many consonants yet.  He has a<br/>\nlot to say and does not feel damaged that many people don&#39;t understand him<br/>\nyet.   Also, he uses &quot;my&quot; consistently as a substitute for either &quot;me&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;I&quot;.   We figure he will get the grammar on that eventually but consider<br/>\nhis solution rather clever.   A few people have asked if  his parents  have<br/>\nconsidered speech therapy (even ones who were fine when he was 2 and 3 are<br/>\ngetting very impatient now) but, fortunately, at least in my opinion, my<br/>\ndaughter-in-law is comfortable with waiting much longer.  Especially since<br/>\nhe is usually able to eventually get his point across and is not constantly<br/>\nfrustrated.  I suppose if either of them were in daycare or school the<br/>\npressure would be much greater.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy brother and I both had speech therapy as children.  My brother at the<br/>\nCallier Center in Dallas where we lived, and me at public school starting<br/>\nin first grade. (No kindergarten back then!).   Speech therapy in the early<br/>\ngrades was not very useful for me......I had a lisp plus a total inability<br/>\nto enunciate the &quot;r&quot; sound at the end of a syllable.  At the beginning of<br/>\nsyllables I compensated with my lips instead of my tongue.   But the group<br/>\nspeech sessions I had did not provide me with any tools to change.  I<br/>\nstopped after about 3rd grade.   Around 6th grade,  the school officials<br/>\nset me back up with some sessions after I was to represent the school in<br/>\nSpelling Bee but they were afraid that judges unfamiliar with my speech<br/>\nwould not understand me.   Those sessions were more helpful since they<br/>\nprovided techniques and explained mechanics but I spent months being aware<br/>\nof how I placed my tongue in everyday conversation!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy brother and I both have some speech eccentricities.  Who knows whether<br/>\nthey would be better or worse depending on how much speech therapy.    If<br/>\nyou listen to Matt he also has some speech differences (particularly for a<br/>\nhomegrown Texas boy!) but I really don&#39;t think a lack of speech therapy<br/>\nharmed him!<br/>\n<br/>\nVicki<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sat, May 5, 2012 at 8:59 AM, keetry &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:keetry@...\">keetry@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ==His mouth may still be developing &lt;snip&gt; That&#39;s one of the reasons<br/>\n&gt; speech therapy is ineffective - it asks kids to do something they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; physically not ready to do.==<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is what I assume.

Everyone was quite alarmed and he was my first child so we began speech interventions when he was around 2.5.  His first word after months of this was &quot;mama&quot;.  He was a premie and had developmental delays and everyone told me that if we didn&#39;t get him help early he would always have issues.  So, we bowed to pressure and began what ended up being about 4 years of therapy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy second child, a now almost 12 year old girl, spoke early, often and clear enough for anyone to understand her.  I was relieved.  As a child I had had speech therapy, though we were told at the time that it was because my adoptive mother was Filipina and I had picked up her accent.  There had been some concern expressed with my son that perhaps my own speech issues were genetic and my children would be more likely to have issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I had my third child.  He was very much like his older brother but without the developmental delays.  We had trouble understanding him for a long time.  And everyone else couldn&#39;t understand almost anything he said for a few years.  But this time we didn&#39;t seek therapy.  We hoped this time that he would outgrow it.  We weren&#39;t convinced that our older son&#39;s speech had improved because of his years of therapy.  We handled things completely different with our youngest son.  We didn&#39;t point out or correct him every time he mispronounced anything and we quickly interpreted what he was saying so others could understand him in an effort to make it a non-issue. He was completely understood by strangers by the time he was 6 (pretty close to the same time our older son was).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, based on my own anecdotal evidence, I would agree that perhaps in some cases therapy may be necessary but in our experience (which is very similar to most of the speech delays I&#39;ve seen) time, support and understanding are just as helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Michelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Speech was Re: Deflecting others need to save my son.","postDate":"1336226340","msgId":67047,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpvM2JuNCszNzBwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGpvMTUwdCtwOHVtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":67044,"nextInTopic":67050,"prevInTime":67046,"nextInTime":67048,"topicId":66982,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"==His mouth may still be developing  That s one of the reasons speech therapy is ineffective - it asks kids to do something they re physically not ready","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-13860521\">==His mouth may still be developing &lt;snip&gt; That&#39;s one of the reasons speech therapy is ineffective - it asks kids to do something they&#39;re physically not ready to do.== <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what I assume.

By &quot;would be doing worse in school&quot; I was thinking of having a harder time being there and a harder time functioning, not having worse grades.  I was thinking of more involved kids where grades aren&#39;t even considered.  Kids in school with severe speech/language challenges (such as late-talking, nonverbal kids, like in the original post) can benefit from support for their communication differences in doing the things they need to do to be there, in the school building, without their parents.  If they can be helped to communicate a little more independently, (by helping them learn to point to what they want to eat or play with, for example, or learn a way to communicate &quot;get away from me&quot; that doesn&#39;t involve hitting or biting) they can navigate a little less stressfully in a pretty stressful situation that they don&#39;t have a choice but go to every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorking in schools with kids in special-ed really primed me to be drawn to unschooling.  I saw the way kids struggled to follow schedules and struggle to &#39;behave appropriately&#39; in a setting that was not designed with them in mind.  It was sad and frustrating, and later reading John Holt, etc., I felt even sadder thinking of many specific examples of kids who had had such a hard time at school, knowing there were alternatives.  But those kids do not have a choice.  Most parents are not willing or able to homeschool.  They Want experts to help them with their children.  Parents in the recent past have fought for their kids with disabilities to have the right to go to school, and get services, and many of them are really defensive of that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo if the kids have to be there, I do think it&#39;s helpful for them to get all the help and support they can get.  &quot;Speech therapy&quot; for them usually involves helping with functional communication, not the old-fashioned sitting at a desk with a lady saying &quot;Say cat&quot; over and over in a sing-song voice.  Maybe that still happens somewhere, but that is not the current standard.  &quot;Speech&quot; has evolved to include language and any form of communication, including social, especially since children with all severities of disabilities are now integrated into regular school buildings and regular classrooms as much as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, unschooling seems *ideal* for children with any sort of disability, IF (big if) their parents are interested, willing and available to do it. If not, they will be in school.  If they are far from &quot;typical&quot;, the one way that they might have an advantage over a typical student is they get to have their own individualized curriculum and a team of professionals who are paid specifically to look out for them and support them however needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, yes, it&#39;s not unschooling.  At all.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf parents are willing and able to unschool, kids can thrive, even those with severe language delays, even without any therapy.  I have seen this, and it is beautiful! :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling parents seek out resources for whatever their children are  interested in, want or need.  I think consulting with a speech/language pathologist can be included in those resources if it is what the children want and are interested in, when the time is right for the child.  It would NOT be a good unschooling resource if it were sought out just because it&#39;s what the neighbor or aunt thinks the child should be doing. <br/>\n<br/>\nmaryann<br/>\nformer speech therapist</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Deflecting others need to save my son.","postDate":"1336178115","msgId":67040,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM0OEY2QzYyLTg1NEMtNDlERS1CQkFFLUI3MjNGQkM4MERGMEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpvMWhrMis4cnFiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpvMWhrMis4cnFiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":67038,"nextInTopic":67042,"prevInTime":67039,"nextInTime":67041,"topicId":66982,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-And many kids who are getting speech/language services in school would be doing worse in school without that support.-=- Probably so.

But, I Adored being with the kids, and I worked hard to make sure they had fun too.  They don&#39;t always hate it or associate it with having things wrong with them, especially if it&#39;s play-based. As far as school goes, it can be like art or gym class, except it&#39;s individualized. :) Not always, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn schools, teachers want articulation therapy for kids in order to be understood and in order to keep the sound issues from interfering with their reading.  Many parents want free therapy, and want to help their kids avoid being teased. (Quite a few parents get upset when they ask for therapy and are told that their child doesn&#39;t qualify because schools want to give them a chance to grow out of it, as most kids do.) If they are special-ed, they are &quot;entitled&quot; to services, and most parents want all they can get.  If the kids need help learning alternative communication, a therapist can be a great resource for the child and the parent, to learn to use signs, pictures, etc. to communicate, to learn ways to play that help encourage language, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I see it, the difference with unschooling is that there isn&#39;t a push to get kids to communicate without parents interpreting, or to get kids to read, or worry as much about teasing.  So there is no need to seek out therapy *just* because there is a developmental &quot;delay&quot;.  Speech therapists can be a resource, like any other resource, though.  If a child is frustrated with not being able to communicate or old enough to notice differences in their speech and want to focus on articulation (being able to produce a certain sounds) then there are resources available.  Parents can seek out people and books and ideas for helping their child with their communication just as they would help them with learning any other skill they wanted to learn, like taking martial arts class or gymnastics, or painting.  Another adult with knowledge and experience is not a *given*, but not always against unschooling, either.<br/>\n <br/>\nmaryann</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Deflecting others need to save my son.","postDate":"1336165169","msgId":67027,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI4REVDQzc4LTVEQzAtNEE4MS04REFCLUYzNzMyOTZGRDQxOUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpvMGZycCtobzlkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpvMGZycCtobzlkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":67025,"nextInTopic":67028,"prevInTime":67026,"nextInTime":67028,"topicId":66982,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Ray s already dealing with issues which I recall my art-student friends talking about when they were in grad school --=- And without student loans to pay","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1207186078\">-=-Ray&#39;s already dealing with issues which I recall my art-student friends talking about when they were in grad school --=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd without student loans to pay off, I&#39;m guessing.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":454093105,"authorName":"lalow","from":"&quot;lalow&quot; &lt;lalougor@...&gt;","profile":"lalow66","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Deflecting others need to save my son.","postDate":"1336160284","msgId":67025,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpvMWI2cyszbXQwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGpvMTI0cCtrODNvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":67022,"nextInTopic":67027,"prevInTime":67024,"nextInTime":67026,"topicId":66982,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Im a speech therapist.

I can get people in contact with her.   She&#39;s not a mandatory reporter in any jurisdiction outside of India (and probably not there, as they don&#39;t have compulsory attendance laws--that&#39;s all taken care of by in-laws and grandparents in India.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Holly was the every-day, 40+ hours a week, Pushpa (the speech therapist mom in India) had offered to advise Holly because the girl had speech issues.  But Holly hadn&#39;t been able to pronounce &quot;r&quot; until she herself was 8 or 9, so she was in favor of not pressing.  But finally one day Pushpa and Holly spoke about the situation.  I was there with Holly.  By asking Holly questions about how the girl drew, and Holly told her about how she bowled (needed a ramp) and I told about when we cut gallon-sized plastic milk jugs with swords at a gathering here that she could only get the sword to the surface of the plastic and push the thing over, really, while others were slicing right through it...   those and some other stories and explanations, and Pushpa said it was a kind of autism that involves muscle tone, too.   And the more Pushpa explained, the more it sounded just exactly like the girl&#39;s dad, whose movements and abilities are also unusual.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut both of them are functioning and interesting and have friends and hobbies and places in them where they&#39;re competent and solid.  Partly that&#39;s because no one has told the girl there is anything wrong with her.  She long, long years of uninterrupted growing at her own speed, thanks to unschooling, so the dad wasn&#39;t stressed about problems with his only child, and she wasn&#39;t stressed either.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some photos of the water cutting.

Having said that, I work with a Speech Pathologist who used to homeschool her kids, and was in a homeschool group with another SLP that homeschooled her kids.  So there are some exceptions, but in general, the school special ed apparatus is built for a purpose.

So they can pass the tests, so the school won&#39;t lose funding. <br/>\nI&#39;d also point out I work with kids like the child in question. Guess what?

Five is not uncommon a age for classic late-talkers (especially boys) to start talking, from what I remember.

Now he&#39;s in musical theater - sings, dances, plays piano, is a real cut-up. At 4, people were saying &quot;he needs services&quot; and his parents... I won&#39;t say they ignored it but they were special ed teachers. They could point to tons of evidence that lots of kids grew out of being weird 4yos. They aren&#39;t unschoolers, but they were very influenced by the work of John Holt.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter was a weird 4yo. She wasn&#39;t so much non-verbal as had an aversion to language... oh, gosh that&#39;s tricky to explain. She didn&#39;t like words and sign language frustrated her because she couldn&#39;t make beautiful perfect hand shapes yet so it wasn&#39;t a good alternative. It helped, in terms of dealing with other people, that I&#39;d spent a lot of time studying Montessori theory and could wave that around like a flag - &quot;we&#39;re using a Montessori-based approach that&#39;s been proven effective with kids with special needs&quot;. There&#39;s enough overlap between the theory and unschooling philosophy it&#39;s even arguably true.  I also did a lot of reading about a bunch of different childhood issues - Sensory Integration Disorder is one I looked at pretty hard since Mo has a lot of odd sensory issues. I haven&#39;t been interested in diagnosing her so much as looking for stories of kids who have things in common with my kid and finding out what&#39;s helpful and what&#39;s not. Some of that, I&#39;ve been able to use to fend off other adults. Some of it I wish I&#39;d found when my stepson, Ray was younger. Now, Mo&#39;s a quirky 10yo, but she&#39;s fully capable of socializing and playing with adults and children. I have a lovely story of her very politely asking an adult friend to back down on the issue of what to wear to play laser tag. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs Schuyler pointed out, having information to back you up - even buzz words to throw around - is a good way to stave off well meaning parents who know the value of services in school but not much about unschooling. In school, getting services early is vital. One of my co-workers just moved to a new school district and his 4yo has been miserable and termed a behavior problem by the new school... right up until his parents realized that his special ed file hadn&#39;t transferred with him. Now, he&#39;s not a &quot;behavior problem&quot; any more, he has a &quot;speech delay&quot; and needs extra help. This is pre-K, not even kindergarten, and &quot;services&quot; are what makes the difference in this kids&#39; life. <br/>\n<br/>\nOutside of school, you get to create an environment which supports your kid. Stories of how other unschoolers do that can be really helpful (and more anecdotal evidence, too):<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/special/\">http://sandradodd.com/special/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt can also help to collect family stories - like my cousin story - to bandy about when people are expressing (well meaning but misplaced) concern.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Deflecting others need to save my son.","postDate":"1336041087","msgId":66983,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMzYwNDEwODcuMzEwNDguWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjg3MzA0Lm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpudGhmMStsazZuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpudGhmMStsazZuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":66982,"nextInTopic":66984,"prevInTime":66982,"nextInTime":66984,"topicId":66982,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Given that she let eff off be an option...

How does she have any greater degree of certainty that your methods are less effective at helping your son than her methods are with helping her child? Her&#39;s may simply be a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing.

I&#39;d research the hell out of it. Knowing things tends to make people trust that you aren&#39;t being whimsical about your child&#39;s well-being. I knew a lot about the benefits of breast-feeding, both to the child and to me. So my breast-feeding Simon and Linnaea until they were 5 and 6 was something that ended up being questioned far less than I anticipated by family. Also I&#39;m really good at telling people that it isn&#39;t their business. If someone threatened me with asking for government intervention, even lightly, I&#39;d be on them like white on rice. I&#39;d ask them exactly how they thought it would benefit my son. I&#39;d ask them exactly how much they felt the government cared about my son and which kind of intervention they thought would be an appropriate intervention for the government to take. If they felt that putting my child into care was a good way of helping him to grow into the kind of man they thought he ought to be. I<br/>\n would be livid.
