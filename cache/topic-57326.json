BUT. sometimes... they&#39;re not.  It&#39;s natural, and I explained to<br/>\nthem that I have those same moments and days, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday was an example of that.  We went to the park, and DS9 asked that I<br/>\ncall a couple of his friends to come, too.  They met us at the park,<br/>\neveryone was playing and having a great time.  Then, one of the boys who<br/>\ncame to meet us was delivered a new pair of shoes that he&#39;d been waiting for<br/>\n(they arrived at his house, and Dad brought them to the park as requested).<br/>\nDS11 immediately stopped playing with the child who got the new shoes and<br/>\ncame to me, insisting we leave *now*.  (he&#39;s been wanting a pair of these<br/>\nparticular shoes for some time, those toe shoe things)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe gathered our stuff and left the park, and for the 10 minute drive home, I<br/>\nheard how &quot;their mom gets them anything they want, even if they don&#39;t have<br/>\nthe money, and *she* doesn&#39;t care.  Every time we see them, they have<br/>\nsomething new, and it&#39;s just not fair, all we ever get are tiny little toys,<br/>\nwe don&#39;t get anything we want...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI sat and listened, and did not jump in with the list of things they they do<br/>\nhave.  I tried very hard to empathize with them, but at the same time, felt<br/>\nlike they were downright mean to me.  That&#39;s my own crap, I&#39;m sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in those moments, what do you say?  Do I just shut up and listen and<br/>\ndon&#39;t say anything?  Do I offer them a hug and keep my mouth closed?  Do I<br/>\napologise that I&#39;m unable to get them everything they desire?  Do I say,<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m sorry you feel like you don&#39;t get enough&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nA little background:  We&#39;re very honest about our money, I answer questions<br/>\nwhen they have them, provide information about our finances, and get them<br/>\nthings they want.  I do believe they are entitled to our money just as much<br/>\nas John and I are.  I go without in order to be able to provide more for<br/>\nthem.  Just wanting to clarify so people understood that I&#39;m not buying<br/>\nmyself everything I want and telling my kids &quot;no&quot;.  I don&#39;t do that.  We<br/>\nalways find a way to get what they want.  Which makes it even harder to hear<br/>\nthe things they were saying to me today.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy nature is to be immediately defensive (working on that, really, I am), so<br/>\nI try to be so careful about what I&#39;m saying and how I&#39;m saying it.  Like so<br/>\nmany, I wasn&#39;t raised in a way that taught me how to be empathetic.  My<br/>\ndefensiveness is likely the reason I survived my childhood.  It doesn&#39;t<br/>\nserve me anymore, so I&#39;m letting it go, but in moments like these, whoa,<br/>\nit&#39;s the first ugly, anger-filled voice that floods my mind.  And because I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to be that defensive person anymore, I just say nothing, for fear<br/>\nof saying the wrong thing, or in the wrong way/tone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m looking for some new tapes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone???  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n&quot;You cannot teach a person anything; you can only help him find it within<br/>\nhimself.&quot; -Galileo<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57315,"nextTopicId":57343}}
