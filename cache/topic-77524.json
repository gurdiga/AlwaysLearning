She also liked to have a choice of clothing - if I gave her 3 pairs of pants to choose from and 3 shirts, she would choose one of each to wear - if she had less choice she often wouldn&#39;t want to put any of them on.

What really helped was to make getting dressed as quick and smooth for him as possible. I would have any clothes ready by the front door and just slip them on as we were leaving, or take them in the car with us, and quickly slip them on him as he got out of the car. We got thinner onesies as the weather warmed up, and eventually he wanted to play in water during the summer, so started wearing swim shorts :-) </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He is 6 now and rarely wears anything other than pyjamas indoors, and although he gets dressed to go out it is still usually done as we are leaving, and he usually gets back into pyjamas or a onesie as soon as we are home.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Louise Mills</p></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":284087656,"authorName":"","from":"semajrak@...","profile":"semajrak","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: 3 year old goes naked","postDate":"1476205828","msgId":77526,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG50ajZlNCsxZGVpNGozQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG50aGNiOSsxbDZqdmZ1QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG50aGNiOSsxbDZqdmZ1QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":77525,"nextInTopic":77527,"prevInTime":77525,"nextInTime":77527,"topicId":77524,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Our son wore only cotton pjs until he was six or so.

Now that we live in California, I doubt he&#39;ll wear socks much all year. &nbsp;When we lived in New York State, he&#39;d wear them to go outside, then often take them off again once he was in. &nbsp; <br><br>Polyester makes him too hot. &nbsp;Socks (even cotton) do too. &nbsp;He doesn&#39;t like feeling hot. &nbsp;Wool is too itchy. &nbsp;He does like cotton knit, though not too bulky or heavy. &nbsp;For us, it has been a matter of finding what works and growing with what he&#39;d grow into. &nbsp;I never let him go in public undressed. &nbsp;That didn&#39;t feel safe to me for a few reasons. &nbsp;I never made him wear something he wasn&#39;t comfortable in either...well...minus the crazy-cute santa outfit his grandma sent him that first year. &nbsp;He was only a month old. &nbsp;The outfit was polyester, and, man, was he unhappy in it! &nbsp;That was my first indication that polyester wasn&#39;t going to work. &nbsp;I think my family thought I was being picky asking for cotton clothes only for Ethan, but that&#39;s okay. &nbsp;He was comfortable. &nbsp;:-)<div><div><br></div><div>Karen James</div></div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] 3 year old goes naked","postDate":"1476203084","msgId":77525,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZBN0Q0Mjc5LUMxMjAtNDEzQi04NjQ2LTYzNDFBM0Q1QTBGNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG50aGNiOSsxbDZqdmZ1QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG50aGNiOSsxbDZqdmZ1QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":77524,"nextInTopic":77526,"prevInTime":77524,"nextInTime":77526,"topicId":77524,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Keep him home until you find some clothes he will wear.

Try turning things inside out and see if that’s more comfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nAvoid polyester or wool—they’re VERY itchy to some people.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou cannot, with words, make it okay for him to be outside at his age without clothes.  It could lead to school-ordered school or loss of custody.  Don’t tell him that.<br/>\nTell him that the government wants all parents to be good parents, and so you can’t be outside without him being appropriately dressed.  You might be able to look up the phrases in your own jurisdiction’s statements about what could consitiute child neglect.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut first, find comfortable things.  And gradually persuade him that going out will need clothes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope others here will have ideas you can use, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":576697157,"authorName":"","from":"katja.bostock@...","profile":"katja.bostock","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"3 year old goes naked","postDate":"1476146345","msgId":77524,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG50aGNiOSsxbDZqdmZ1QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":77525,"prevInTime":77523,"nextInTime":77525,"topicId":77524,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My son just turned 3.

This past summer he chose not to wear any clothing other than his diaper. He wouldn&#39;t wear sun protective clothing by the pool or a live vest when we wanted to be on a boat. (This resulted in no boating for him and I, and taking a ferry instead of joining the family on their boat) No shoes either even when the roads were hot and the leaves were prickly. I assumed he&#39;d start wearing clothes when fall comes around and he will have a reason to do so. It has been cooler here in PA for a few weeks now and he has not worn anything. This weekend we went apple picking. He was shivering in the shade with just his diaper on. I kept holding him under my coat to warm him up and offered pants and a jacket, both with soft fleece inside for him to be comfortable. Once he let me put the pants on him only to struggle and pull them off one minute later.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>What do I do?</span></p><p><span><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-429289591yui-cursor\"></span></p></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77522,"nextTopicId":77537}}
