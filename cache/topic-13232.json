She has 3<br/>\nkids and has kept one of the bedrooms as a television/playroom in which the<br/>\nwhole family spends lots of time. She was thrilled to describe how she<br/>\ncould now keep her living room completely tidy with NO kids toys or clutter<br/>\nin it. This way when friends came over things were neat and no one had to<br/>\nbe bothered with the children as they would all be out of sight. Her kids<br/>\nalso got a cat recently but they only kept it for 2 weeks as she couldn&#39;t<br/>\nstand the mess it was probably making it. Now keep in mind this family also<br/>\nhas a fulltime live-in maid as do most people here so my colleague doesn&#39;t<br/>\nactually have to do any cleaning or cooking herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the conversation I didn&#39;t think much of it until this morning as I<br/>\nwas in the shower. I remembered when we moved in here being very excited as<br/>\nthe place has 5 bathrooms and so I was thrilled at the idea of having my<br/>\nown (our last place had 1 bathroom so I was coming off that:) But today I<br/>\nlooked around at all the extra &quot;stuff&quot; that seems to have gravitated in<br/>\nwith me. The rubber ducks and baby shampoo for the newest little one. The<br/>\nfoam letters with all the kids&#39; names that were plastered on the walls from<br/>\nmy 8-year-old. Bubbles, plastic ball, water balloon, funnel, teen face<br/>\nwash.... <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I hit the living room I saw the mini trampoline, the big Arabic<br/>\ncushions that the boys use for tumbling, baby playmat, dog and cat toys,<br/>\npictures all over the walls, book shelf full of kid and adult books and<br/>\nstuff. Boxes of legos and playmobile, and a skateboard in one corner.<br/>\nSomeone has placed a cowboy hat on my 5 foot Malaysian Goddess statue and<br/>\nthere seems to be a bouncy ball in the mouth of one of my African masks.<br/>\nThe Zen garden has small plastic animals in it as well as an umbrella from<br/>\na fancy drink. Along the window there are 2 statues of Buddhas as well as 6<br/>\norangina bottles with different colored water in them (they catch the light<br/>\nand look cool according to 3rd son). My computer desk is piled with cds of<br/>\nvarious things, rocks and shells to look at in the microscope, and two<br/>\npencil holders made out of clay (they don&#39;t actually hold pencils and are<br/>\nenormous but were made with love). This is in addition to various lego<br/>\nsculptures placed around the furniture.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you know I look at all this and I just think how beautiful. This to me<br/>\nis topnotch interior design. I couldn&#39;t imagine living my life without<br/>\nbeing surrounded by all these things that represent my family. I may<br/>\nsometimes snap a little when I stand barefoot on lego or can&#39;t find a free<br/>\nchair as they are all part of a huge tent. But I couldn&#39;t imagine living in<br/>\na house in which my children didn&#39;t feel welcome to be in every room. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt just seems to me that if you can&#39;t share the rooms of your home with<br/>\nyour children then how can you share their lives.
