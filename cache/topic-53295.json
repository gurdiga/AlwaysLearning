She&#39;s just lived her life in a rich environment  <br/>\nwith many people who regarded her as whole and real and who spoke to  <br/>\nher as a person.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe people named are Linnea, who is six and is Bea Mantovani&#39;s  <br/>\ndaughter, and  Adam Daniel, six and is Julie Daniel&#39;s daughter (Holly  <br/>\nstayed with them for six weeks last winter).<br/>\n<br/>\nThursday, April 22, 2010<br/>\nMaybe they should be called &quot;page markers&quot;<br/>\nI have a bookmark that I made of turquoise and purple paper and box  <br/>\ntape.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinnea asked me what it was, I said it&#39;s a bookmark. She asked where I  <br/>\ngot it, I said I made it. She asked where I made it, I said upstairs  <br/>\nin the kitchen. She asked if she could open it (double sided), I said  <br/>\nshe could not. She asked why she couldn&#39;t- There were too many answers  <br/>\nto give! I think I could have been in a &#39;put it back, please don&#39;t  <br/>\nmess with my things&#39; mood, but guess what, I&#39;m not! I said that it&#39;s  <br/>\njust what it is, it doesn&#39;t open up. I grabbed a book and opened to a  <br/>\nrandom page and showed Linnea what a bookmark is for. I tried finding  <br/>\na page again without the bookmark, and then with the bookmark. Both of  <br/>\nus smiling and giggly. We were sitting next to a box of tissue, I told  <br/>\nLinnea that my mom uses kleenex as bookmarks and grabbed another book  <br/>\nand marked it! Linnea was amused at how that made the book look and  <br/>\nthought it was funny... And understood that it worked the same as any  <br/>\nbookmark. And I&#39;m pretty sure she also understood why my bookmark  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t need any more parts or colors or layers to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got back to what I was doing, computer things (as Adam Daniel would  <br/>\nsay), while Linnea was still checking it all out and playing with her  <br/>\nstuffed toys. Then she stuck my bookmark in one of those books and  <br/>\nasked me to guess which page she wanted, of course I opened to some  <br/>\nunmarked pages first (since this game doesn&#39;t have rules against  <br/>\nthat), and we both laughed when I got the right page and we played  <br/>\nagain. We found a way to play with that bookmark! And a real way, with  <br/>\nreal books. That was really cool.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe books were &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; and &quot;Sixty Million Frenchmen  <br/>\nCan&#39;t Be Wrong&quot;-- Both books I have borrowed from Linnea&#39;s parents,  <br/>\nand both I have yet to even open... Except to show my friend why I  <br/>\nmade that bookmark.<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------<br/>\nHolly doesn&#39;t post much on her blog.
