She is a different build from her two sisters (who are small boned and petite) and she got this notion (helped by other school kids in the neighbourhood) that she was overweight.  I would tell her time and again that she certainly was not (as she truly wasn&#39;t!) and it just didn&#39;t seem to sink in!  However, over a period of time, some other people (not mum that is!) have said how slim she is and one time I said to her lets look up on the internet and see the height/weight tables and see if you are overweight, and so we did this and she was actually 1kg underweight for the lightest weight for her height!  Now, thankfully, that one made an impact!<br/>\n<br/>\nShe still has a bit of a problem now and then with it, but I just remind her about the height/weight tables!  The other thing I did was &#39;educate&#39; her about weight issues.  I told her the only thing she has to ever work on is eating only when she is hungry and avoid comfort eating (which her mum has had trouble with!) - and about how exercise is good and firms you up.  We did a notebook for a week or two, jotting down what she ate and whether she was hungry or not and this worked well.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s such a hard time for young girls these days - self image gets so confused with body image!<br/>\n<br/>\nWishing you well!<br/>\n    Teresa<br/>\nMumto5kidz  :D<br/>\nliving in New Zealand <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:maryfhickman@...\">maryfhickman@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, March 30, 2004 5:01 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] unhappy about herself<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi,<br/>\n<br/>\n  My nine year old daughter is having fits about her looks.

The fact that American<br/>\ngirls now make the body their central project is not an accident or a<br/>\ncuriosity,&quot; writes Brumberg, &quot;it is a symptom of historical changes that<br/>\nare only now beginning to be understood.&quot; The historical photos, thorough<br/>\nresearch, and political even-handedness make this a book of worth and<br/>\nsincerity. The Body Project is also comforting for women, adolescents,<br/>\nparents, lesbians, and male lovers of women--helping us sort out the roots<br/>\nof female insecurities, obsessions, and angst.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--bc--<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59432230,"authorName":"Joanna Wilkinson","from":"&quot;Joanna Wilkinson&quot; &lt;Wilkinson6@...&gt;","profile":"joanna514","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: unhappy about herself","postDate":"1080586738","msgId":19172,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM0OXJsaStvZzRsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDI0NTg4NzcwLjEwODA1Nzk2OTIzNTcuSmF2YU1haWwucm9vdEBmb3p6aWUucHNwLnBhcy5lYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":19170,"nextInTopic":19173,"prevInTime":19171,"nextInTime":19173,"topicId":19170,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... larger than most of her friends, unhappy with how clothes fit and all around down.

She&#39;s getting more and more <br/>\nself assured as she gets older.  At 9 and 10 she was very unhappy <br/>\nabout her height (short) and weight.  The height issue was easier <br/>\nfor me to deal with, because there is really nothing you can do <br/>\nabout it but learn to accept it as who you are.  Talking about that <br/>\nand finding the positives was what we did.  Now that she is 13 and <br/>\nhas a more womanly figure and doesn&#39;t get assumed to be 3 to 4 years <br/>\nyounger than what she is, she likes the uniqueness of her height.<br/>\nHer weight is a harder issue for me to deal with, because it is <br/>\nsomething I deal with and have dealt with since I was about 16.<br/>\nI haven&#39;t always had a healthy attitude about it, and trying to help <br/>\nher find her way to happiness with this issue is a learning <br/>\nexperience for me.<br/>\nWe talk about all of this together.  She has complete control of <br/>\nwhat she eats, and giving her that control has helped so much with <br/>\nher finding her self control/motivation with food and exercise.  She <br/>\nhad to decide what is important for her.  This society makes a huge <br/>\ndeal about weight with health issues to looking &quot;right&quot;.  There is a <br/>\nlot of good information out there and a lot of harmful, negative <br/>\nviews.  In discussing these issues we have both come to conclusions <br/>\nthat feel right for us.<br/>\nTalking about it and growing more mature has helped us both.<br/>\nSo my advice is time and communication.  Taking an unschooling <br/>\nattitude and delving into why we feel the way we feel about <br/>\nsomething and figuring out what we can do about it has been our <br/>\napproach with this.<br/>\nHope this helps.  <br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117956499,"authorName":"maryfhickman@jps.net","from":"maryfhickman@...","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"unhappy about herself","postDate":"1080579691","msgId":19170,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI0NTg4NzcwLjEwODA1Nzk2OTIzNTcuSmF2YU1haWwucm9vdEBmb3p6aWUucHNwLnBhcy5lYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":19172,"prevInTime":19169,"nextInTime":19171,"topicId":19170,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, My nine year old daughter is having fits about her looks.
