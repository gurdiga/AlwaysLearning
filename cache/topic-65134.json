See if help is available and while looking, take solid steps toward getting all of the things taken care of that need to be taken care of. One box at a time, one step at a time. Small incremental steps toward getting all that you need done is better than eddying about in a place where you can&#39;t seem to do what you need to do.

Her and I embarking on our own for the first time since she was a toddler...decorating a new place that she and I picked out, painting, fixing things up, even the apartment hunting was fun. She&#39;s excited to have her own room again which we havnt had in 4 years. She seems to feel free and excited. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow our big move is a week away. And I havnt even started packing. I didnt even get a new calendar til this week for 2012 and realized we havnt been out anywhere fun in 20 days like we used to. Now today I wake up to find snow on the ground and want to go sledding or DO something but i must be either stressed, overwhelmed or full of anxiety because ive had a headache all week that wont quit. Im scared if I&#39;m doing the right thing now at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe do HAVE to move...the full effects of my divorce have set in- not having the money to afford but half of where we currently live, and I realized now that we stopped spending our free time with my boyfriend and his son to accomplish this move, (the working on blending our families thing has to be shelved right now since the holidays). The only thing I&#39;ve gotten my daughter &quot;out&quot; to is Girl Scout meetings. We even had to let go of dance and other activities we couldnt afford, and spent alot of days this month at the DPW office, SS office, lawyers&#39; and realtors&#39; offices for all the transitioning thats occured. And of course we signed a lease. <br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to go somewhere far (like opposite coast) and really start over, but again, financial restrictions. I am feeling sad over the upcoming conferences we wont make and my daughter is begging to go now. I&#39;ve asked her before the new year which she would rather have- to put everything we own in storage and travel to conferences and other things, living out of a cheap hotel room, or to have her own enviroment for all her toys, experiments, books. dolls etc. It was extreme but there were no other options but a shelter, which i avoided. I dont know if it was wise to let her choose, and I&#39;m not currently seeing the point in staying in the area we are going to be living in again for another year, as we are still around the same school minded people, if thats even a proper term. <br/>\n<br/>\nPoint is, I&#39;m feeling so nervous about it and it was worse when I&#39;ve been attending the weekly womens support group against domestic violence (Women in Transition) thats mandatory for me to go to every week since they funded our move with a downpayment. Yet this has been the highpoint of my daughter&#39;s week. She enjoys going in the childcare room to make things on her own for 2 hours and I keep thinking- when we get moved in our new place she&#39;ll be able to do that again and have her toys out, and do arts and crafts without her father breaking them. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I&#39;m still feeling guilty, as much as the counselors there have told me i gave her the pricelsss gift of freedom against violence in the home, they think strongly that she should be in school. I feel concerned about these remarks. I dont even know where to go from here with this, but i am afraid perhaps of any consequences that could negatively affect her. I see school right now as something that would hinder us both further, but is our situation not prime for unschooling anymore and Im refusing to see it??? <br/>\n<br/>\nor could it be just the moving? I was reading a topic somewhere that the poster said, &quot;this is just a season of life&quot; over and over, about their own situation and it helped me feel better. but I&#39;m more concerned about my daughter feeling ok, as I do know at times, she&#39;s lonely, and the close friend of hers she was doing sleepovers with had to end due to the girl&#39;s house amongst many in the city where we live, is infested with bedbugs. apparently its a big problem in certain neighborhoods right in the center of our city, and i had no idea but was grateful enough that they told us to stay away for awhile and vice versa til they get it under control. Thats been the only thing my daughter&#39;s cried over, missing that friend. <br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise, she seems ok, but I&#39;m looking out for more opinions, anything to learn more from all of you.<br/>\nThank you.
