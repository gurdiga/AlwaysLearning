Is there anywhere you&#39;d draw the line and just say, &quot;Okay, I give, <br/>\nit&#39;s not worth THAT&quot;?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are already some really big choices that we have made in our family so <br/>\nthat I can stay home with the kids. We moved across the country to a more <br/>\naffordable area, for one thing. We&#39;re about to move again because Utah is so <br/>\nintolerable as a place for my soon to be teenage kids to socialize in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI plan on going underground in Oregon so that my kids don&#39;t have to test. <br/>\nWe&#39;re also going to get a smaller house and start a business to further the <br/>\nwhole familiy&#39;s unschooling adventures. (It&#39;ll be a real adventure if the <br/>\nbusiness goes under, huh?!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t hesitate to help them complete a test, but I&#39;d first go to great <br/>\nlengths to make sure they weren&#39;t required to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI made my former sil (my brother&#39;s ex-wife) the named guardian for my kids <br/>\nin my will even though she&#39;s no longer &quot;family&quot;. She&#39;s my best friend and <br/>\nshe&#39;ll raise my kids the way I have been. There was no better choice IMHO.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I haven&#39;t yet met the obstacle that will force me to go backwards in <br/>\nthis decision to keep my family together and happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nChat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.msn.com\">http://messenger.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6710,"nextTopicId":6746}}
