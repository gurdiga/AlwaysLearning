Years ago I worked for an adult literacy program and it wasn&#39;t all cuddles on the sofa ;) People did sit side-by-side, but then all the help was one-on-one and that&#39;s often easier, or sitting at adjacent sides of a table. It depended, too, on what a person wanted to learn to read. Adults may want to learn to read maps, street signs or job applications, or they may want to learn to recognize the names of food items to better shop for themselves and their families. Some few want to read the bible or bedtime stories to children.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Once the desire was there it took no prompting or reminding on the readers part<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nWith adults who have been in school, the biggest hurdle is not &quot;desire&quot; but self esteem: they&#39;ve been told for years they&#39;re stupid for not reading - which is pretty amazing once you learn all the machinations it requires to manage a highly print-oriented environment without reading! It takes a big, big step for an adult to admit to other adults - even complete strangers - that he or she cannot read. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Adults who cant read","postDate":"1324494084","msgId":64593,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4QkUzQTAwLTI4QjktNEU1Ri1BMjk1LTNEMzM1OTI1OTYwOUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMjQ0OTIzMDEuNTQwNjkuWWFob29NYWlsQ2xhc3NpY0B3ZWIxNjEwMDUubWFpbC5iZjEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDEzMjQ0OTIzMDEuNTQwNjkuWWFob29NYWlsQ2xhc3NpY0B3ZWIxNjEwMDUubWFpbC5iZjEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64592,"nextInTopic":64598,"prevInTime":64592,"nextInTime":64594,"topicId":64592,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-once the person/child had the desire to read ( it took maybe 11 weeks ) Once the desire was there it took no prompting or reminding on the readers part-=- ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-586960224\">-=-once the person/child had the desire to read ( it took maybe 11 weeks ) Once the desire was there it took no prompting or reminding on the readers part-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nFor an adult who hasn&#39;t learned to read, desire will be an important factor.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a child of any age, desire isn&#39;t enough.
