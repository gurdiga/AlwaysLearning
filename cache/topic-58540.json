Not in public schools, for the most part these days. And there have been college level &quot;physics for poets&quot; and &quot;math for artists&quot; classes that use similar strategies. Looking into those sorts of things can be helpful for parents looking at natural learning and thinking &quot;but there&#39;s No Math&quot; - not so good for natural learning if parents try to push &quot;The History of Zero&quot; (fascinating book, if you like that sort of thing) with an agenda of &quot;trying to promote math&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nReading (or watching or hearing) stories in general, fact or fiction, involves math if you think of &quot;math&quot; in terms of patterns and relationships rather than &quot;formulae and figures&quot;.

It&#39;s always amazing to me how many people are in any kind of market as much for the experience as anything else.

Wouldn&#39;t it be interesting to have<br/>\nmath lesson which read more  like a  story than simply boring formulae and<br/>\nfigures. Sometime back I had read about a math teacher who told his pupils<br/>\nstories of great discoveries, great architecture and exploring that used<br/>\nmath as a tool. Among them where the building of the pyramids, the mapping<br/>\nand scaling of the entire Himalayan range and  how the height of Everest was<br/>\ncalculated without actually climbing it with a tape and measure and the most<br/>\ninteresting one I found was the secret behind why one is one and two is two<br/>\nand three is three and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne is one because in the Arabic numerals one is written in such a way that<br/>\nit has one angle, two has two, three has three and guess what zero is zero<br/>\nsince it has no angles. I wish someone had taught me math that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nMath is probably one of the most creative area of the human mind but<br/>\nunfortunately for most it has been reduced to common market place......<br/>\n<br/>\nThe intermingling of art, culture, music, math and science is and surely<br/>\nmust be the future of education for holistic growth of the human heart and<br/>\nmind. Does any math teacher ever tell us how math plays a important role in<br/>\ndeciding the meter of a tune or how many beats each Indian classical Raga<br/>\nhas. I learn Kathak, a classical dance form, and the amount of math that<br/>\ngoes into each composition is intricate and amazing.
