(right, sandra?!) it is because i&#39;m in the midst of moving thru a huge erratic barrier, searching for a way to have a solid firm boundary between what my family is about and what my mother thinks it should be like. not as easy as it sounds...as you know. thank god for my art therapy group and these USing forums, my blog, my friends who US & for my children or i think i&#39;d go insane from the pressure to conform. i have lived long enough doing just that and i&#39;m so DONE. now how to break out gracefully and not go to extremes as i can do so easily, and just go w/ RUing despite my mothers&#39; fears and objections......................yikes.  my mother is not my self, right? please remind me now and then, will you, mamas?<br/>\n<br/>\nhugs.<br/>\n<br/>\nlis<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Marcy&quot; &lt;sweetpackages@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nso,I never thought my first post to this group here would be like this but here goes..<br/>\nIm 39 and mom to my two daughters 5 and 3 1/2. My oldest was in half day pre-k due to pressure from my parents to do the right thing and enroll her in school. I knew in my heart this wasnt right for her or for our family and on Mar 16 discussed this with her and we decided that she wouldnt be going back to school. Since then my parents and other family members have given me such grief you cant imagine,well you probably all can :-)<br/>\ntensions have gotten to such a point that I have no contact with my sister or her husband due to a confrontation they caused in front of my girls at my parents house saying what i was doing was wrong and sick and hurtful to my children,threw water in my face etc etc<br/>\nneedless to say we left my parents house and havent or spoken to my sister since.she thinks Im a failure because Im &quot;just a Mom&quot; as she put it and not a corporate worker like her and that Im lots of other things that I wont even post here.<br/>\nsince that day things were strained with my parents because I was always the one who kept the peace and said I was sorry to &quot;eep the peace&quot; within the family at my own expense.<br/>\n<br/>\nnow it is affecting my relationship with my parents ,mostly my mother because she feels Im changing,and Im isolating myself fromt he real world and not showing my kids who the boss is when they express their feelings and &quot;dont put them in line&quot; She is saying that Im all about my girls and husband and not showing feelings for anyone else and that I am not the same person. I said I guess thats right,I wasnt really me before. Now Im voicing my opinions and standing up for myself ,and my thoughts and my feelings and Iguess that is making everyone uncomfortable because Im not going along for the ride anymore.<br/>\nshe was over the house today and tried to interfere with a project my daughter was doing,my daughter got upset and said I want to do it,my mom continued to show her &quot;the right way&quot; and my daughter got upset and said I like my way better and then when she didnt let up, she said &quot;I want you to leave Grandma&quot;. well my mother didnt like that at all and my mother insists that I should have made my daughter apologize and Im not showing her right from wrong. I told her that is how she was feeling and Im not going to tell her not to express her feelings whether she is happy sad or mad,they are her feelings and she is entitled to feel that way. <br/>\n<br/>\nthat didnt go over well and she went into the rant,that this isnt like me and that I joined a cult or something,this isnt her daughter talking and something has changed and Im going to have a nervous breakdown if I let my kids say what they want and not be told how to talk to their grandma, I said she didnt curse at you,or even scream.she was upset and told you that.<br/>\nshe said Im not upset at her,Im upset at you for not demanding an apology for me. <br/>\nAm I missing something here?..is there something I truly did wrong here and how can I get my parents,to understand that this might not be how they raised me or how they were rais..ed but just because Im doing something different ,that Im not hurting or damaging my kids.<br/>\nI really feel this is the start of the end with some of my family relationships.<br/>\nthanks for any insight<br/>\nMarcy<br/>\n<br/>\n--- End forwarded message --- </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44628,"nextTopicId":44659}}
