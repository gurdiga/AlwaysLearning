I know a lot of parents worry that if their child spends hours and hours a day playing video games, they won&#39;t get any exercise. My kids love to play video games, and jump on the trampoline. Because they are confident that they are able to play their games as much as they want to, they aren&#39;t reluctant to move away from the games for a short while to do something else. Most days, whether they are on their own or playing together or with friends, they play their games for a while, then go outside and jump on the trampoline for 5 mins or half an hour, then happily come back in and play video games again, then they&#39;ll go back outside for a little while again. It can look like they are on the computer/ipad all day, but if I step back and look at what is really happening, they do have spurts of exercise and other activities in between the gaming. If I notice them getting upset with the game or seeming restless or uncomfortable, I will bring them food or a drink, or say &#39;do you want to jump on the trampoline for a bit&#39;. Sometimes they don&#39;t, sometimes they happily pop outside for a while and come back in refreshed and able to move on in their game.</div><div dir=\"ltr\"><br></div><div dir=\"ltr\">Find out what games he&#39;s liking on Roblox, chat to him about them, maybe find other resources (movies, games, puzzles books, whatever he likes) along the same topics of the games that he&#39;s playing, and leave them around for him to see, or watch/play/read them yourself and he may or may not join you. And help him find opportunities to climb trees - if you are all out together, find trees that are fun (and legal) to climb. Maybe if you&#39;re at the museum, your other son could go in with the group and you and this son could stay outside and climb the trees. Are there trees at your place that he can climb? Help him feel comfortable doing that as something he loves. When he&#39;s able to pursue his own interests, even if it seems that he doesn&#39;t have many, then he&#39;ll be happier and more confidently able to expand into other interests, if and when he&#39;s ready. Or he may always have a small set of interests that he delves into deeply, that&#39;s the case for some kids.<br></div><div dir=\"ltr\"><br></div><div dir=\"ltr\">Annie</div></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":52334861,"authorName":"Monifa","from":"Monifa &lt;mkr411@...&gt;","profile":"momof1ds","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: help inspire child","postDate":"1569725184","msgId":78611,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4NDE2ODc2NDcuNTQ0NDEwLjE1Njk3MjUxODQyNTFAbWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDE4NDE2ODc2NDcuNTQ0NDEwLjE1Njk3MjUxODQyNTEucmVmQG1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":78610,"nextInTopic":78612,"prevInTime":78610,"nextInTime":78612,"topicId":78605,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Please say more about how your son likes to climb trees.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1150107152\"><html><head><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml><o:OfficeDocumentSettings><o:AllowPNG/><o:PixelsPerInch>96</o:PixelsPerInch></o:OfficeDocumentSettings></xml><![endif]--></head>\n<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml><o:OfficeDocumentSettings><o:AllowPNG/><o:PixelsPerInch>96</o:PixelsPerInch></o:OfficeDocumentSettings></xml><![endif]-->\nPlease say more about how your son likes to climb trees.<br><br><br>\n\n</html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":403767111,"authorName":"Jo Isaac","from":"Jo Isaac &lt;joanneisaac@...&gt;","profile":"joanne.isaac","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] help inspire child","postDate":"1569720318","msgId":78610,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERCNlAxODlNQjA1MjAyNTAxMDY1Q0NDRkVDOTg5OUNBMEI3ODMwQERCNlAxODlNQjA1MjAuRVVSUDE4OS5QUk9ELk9VVExPT0suQ09NPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PHFtbTg1disxaTI3bHEwQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PHFtbTg1disxaTI3bHEwQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":78609,"nextInTopic":78611,"prevInTime":78609,"nextInTime":78611,"topicId":78605,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It sounds to me like your child is already inspired - to play Roblox..so it seems that it is you, the Mom, who needs more deschooling to see how awesome Roblox","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-625959053\"><html>\r\n<head>\r\n \r\n<style type=\"text/css\">#ygrps-yiv-625959053 P {margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;}</style>\r\n</head>\r\n \r\n<div style=\"font-family:Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);\">\r\n<span style=\"color:rgb(32, 31, 30);font-family:Georgia;font-size:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);display:inline;\">It sounds to me like your child is already inspired - to play Roblox..so it seems that it is you, the Mom, who needs\r\n more deschooling to see how awesome Roblox is.&nbsp;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==<span style=\"font-family:Georgia;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);display:inline;\">I take him and his twin brother to museum homeschool trips and he always wanders away and says it is boring.&nbsp; Sometimes he participates in the art classes\r\n we sign up for.==<br>\r\n</span><br>\r\nMuseum homeschool trips suck.

The 16-year-old likes playing competitive games with friends, things involving missions and tactics. The 13-year-old plays mostly roleplay games.<br><br>For the older, it&#39;s about playing with a group of friends he made through mostly Minecraft and other games. He&#39;s developed, over the last few years of gaming, into a good team player, a good team leader, and a good manager. He&#39;s recently started running an online D&amp;D game, and his art skills are suddenly blossoming as he creates his own maps, character drawings and animals. He&#39;s moving on to making his own games as well, learning to code. He&#39;s going to be a great person to work with, one day.<br><br>My 13-year-old plays with a group of friends she made through Roblox. They&#39;ve created their own club and have a Discord server where they chat and plan games and carry on different roleplays. A while ago, last year, she was elected President of their club, winning nearly everyone&#39;s vote. That seems to have dropped by the wayside, as the group has evolved, but she&#39;s still the person the others look to to mediate, solve problems, and help with personal issues. She&#39;s got really good at stepping back and letting other people shape the roleplay story, even when it means taking it is a direction she doesn&#39;t like, but she&#39;s also good at forward planning and coming up with new ideas. She keeps records sometimes of what they&#39;ve done, writing down the stories to help them plan, sometimes writing scripts for future use. And recently she&#39;s moved on to creating her own characters to draw, creating stories and relationships and making comics with them.<br><br>If I&#39;d been trying to &#39;figure them out&#39; instead of simply helping them do what they enjoyed, back when they were ten, I wouldn&#39;t have seen how spending hours on their computers would lead to such great skills in teamwork, collaboration, management, mediation. Those would NOT have been things I was looking for, in a ten-year-old&#39;s gaming. But that&#39;s the thing about learning - there&#39;s always so much more going on, so much more that people CAN learn from anything they do, than we expect there to be. And if we&#39;re constantly distracting them with new activities and new things, they don&#39;t have time to learn all those extra things.<br><br>There are years ahead.

That was in response to a comment I&#39;d made about a ballet my daughter had watched on PBS. Not long after that, they had real live ballerinas at the library&#39;s weekly storytime. Up close, you could see that their costumes were worn. The few steps they did in the little room at the library weren&#39;t that exciting, I&#39;m sure due to the lack of space and the logistics of spinning around in a room full of preschoolers. I know less than nothing about ballet, but I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s meant to be seen from the audience with an appropriate stage and lots of room for the dancers to move. What I do know is that my daughter was more excited about the televised performance than what she saw at storytime. (I&#39;m sure a child who&#39;d already been exposed to lots of ballet and wanted to be a dancer would be more excited by the chance to talk to a ballerina and see her costume and shoes up close.)&nbsp;</div><div dir=\"ltr\"><br></div><div dir=\"ltr\">Another wek, the library had firefighters who put on all of their gear and the breathing apparatus so that the kids could see and hear it all and ask questions and touch things.

Today I watched Shakespeare&#39;s Henry IV, parts 1 and 2. Then I watched a few episodes of the Food Network&#39;s Chopped. Do these get lumped into the same category even as each other—or the same category as writing my paper on Stalinist-era vs. post-Stalinist productions of Hamlet—or as working on the fantasy novel I started for NaNoWriMo—or as playing social games on Facebook or word puzzles with my mom several hours away from me—or Skyping with my best friend who is in the UK this year—or as reading Anna Karenina (and then skyping at the aforementioned friend to complain about it)?&nbsp;</p><p style=\"font-family:-webkit-standard;\"><br></p><p style=\"font-family:-webkit-standard;\">If I was watching a live production of Henry IV, that would be cultural, artistic, educational.

And it would lack the movie-specific elements like cinematography and a beautiful score that only screen-time movies/tv provide.) If I was reading a printed copy of Anna Karenina, Dracula, or The Scarlet Pimpernel, those are considered classics and worth my time—again, educational and cultured. (Although I could just as easily have been reading the Hunger Games, Harry Potter, and a Tad Williams fantasy novel this week.) If I was playing boggle in person with my mom, that&#39;s allowed to be fine, bonding time, and fun, but playing the phone app with each other means we can do it on our schedule, over the course of several days, and with half a state between us. And none of these fun and voluntary activities should be lumped in together with the hours I&#39;ve spent this week working on grad school papers, just because I prefer NOT to write 70+ pages by hand in this day and age (and, wait, I&#39;m not allowed to turn in handwritten papers anyway, cause what professor would possibly want to read that).&nbsp;</p><p style=\"font-family:-webkit-standard;\"><br></p><p style=\"font-family:-webkit-standard;\">Playing The Sims does not equal watching the newest episode of Scandal does not equal drafting my thesis proposal on the musicals of Sondheim &amp; Prince does not equal relaxing to Bejeweled does not equal reading the blog Feminist Frequency does not equal gleefully searching for news and fan theories on the next season of Sherlock does not equal reading a PDF version of Anna Karenina does not equal doing the social media marketing work I do for a friend&#39;s restaurant does not equal researching 18th century English joke books for a play I worked on recently does not equal writing this way, way too long comment. But I do all of those on a screen—even on the same screen, since I use my laptop for all of those things—so they all get called &quot;screen time&quot; and dismissed as a guilty pleasure and a waste of my time at best—at worst, as something actually rotting my brain and doing some kind of damage to me while taking away from time and energy that should be spent doing Real Stuff.
