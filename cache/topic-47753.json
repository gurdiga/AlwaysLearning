The university was only about 20 minutes drive away and she would drive off in the morning as if going to a job and come home in the evening for tea.

I&#39;m <br/>\nsurprised to hear that she wants to &quot;get away from them,&quot; which is how <br/>\nshe put it.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen that over and over again, even with &quot;nice&quot; parents.  My parents were nice, but I moved out as soon as I could so that I could finally live the way I wanted to live, and do what I wanted to do, without my parents rules and questions and opinions.<br/>\nThis mom that I met is like that.  She doesn&#39;t like her son&#39;s friends and is suspicious of all of his activities.  He made a comment today about the fact that his mother doesn&#39;t really like him very much.  I asked him why and he said that he isn&#39;t the person that she wishes he was.  I&#39;m sure she cares about him and cares for him.  Lots of parents are like that.  I don&#39;t meet a lot of parents that really truly like their teens, just for who they are as people.<br/>\nSometimes I&#39;m so incredibly struck with the idea that all these parents are out there raising people, real human beings and never bother to understand or accept that those people grow up into their own individual selves with their own individual ideas and likes and dislikes.  While they are young and small they can control them easier, but once they are teenagers, they get very little say in what goes on, even if they try very hard to.  It&#39;s really sad, that huge disconnect of parent/child relationship.<br/>\nWhat I see of unschooled teens, and some homeschooled teens, is soooo very different.  The older Chamille gets, the more I see the difference, even of what I remember of my own teen years, which really weren&#39;t bad.  It&#39;s just that Chamille&#39;s got it better!<br/>\nWe watched a movie after Chamille and Cyle came home.  It had a teen and her parents.  Her parents were nice and the daughter kept blowing them off, in that typical, &quot;leave me alone&quot; fashion.  Chamilles asks &quot;why is she doing that, her parents are really nice?&quot;.  Cyle and I both informed her that it was very typical, the parents were asking her to clean her room and do her homework, etc, they had an agenda and it wasn&#39;t a &quot;let&#39;s get to know our wonderful human being daughter agenda&quot;.  Cyle pointed out that at least they asked, he said his dad would never ask, he&#39;d demand and expect it done.  So there are nicer ways to make your child do things, but it&#39;s still an implied demand, with the assumption of control.<br/>\nMy own parents fell into the nicer camp of making their kids do things.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] relationships and gratitude","postDate":"1254613249","msgId":47756,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVBRDYzNzQyLTNEQzctNDc3Ni1BQjk3LUUxREQ0MTU0Mzk4QkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhhOGhyZSt0ZGgzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhhOGhyZSt0ZGgzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47755,"nextInTopic":47757,"prevInTime":47755,"nextInTime":47757,"topicId":47753,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-My kids are whole and full and so is my life BECAUSE of how we live it!-=- Beautiful.

They met up with a friend there, who&#39;s mother insisted on meeting me.  If I&#39;d known I was going to meet someone, I would&#39;ve put something else on.  I had only heard of this mom through various accounts from the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer son is really nice, but he really didn&#39;t want me to meet his mom, he doesn&#39;t want his mom anywhere near his life.  He has a dad, a step dad, a step mom, his mom, and his mom&#39;s boyfriend and 13 siblings.  They all have a lot of money and they drive nice cars, and the mom is a bit snobbish about money and people who don&#39;t have it.  It&#39;s more confusing than the Brady Bunch!  I knew all this while I was waiting to meet this woman in my scrunchy old sweater and jeans, glad I&#39;d taken a shower at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile we were waiting I said something to Chamille about how I wish I&#39;d known I was meeting her so that I could&#39;ve at least dressed a little nicer and put lip stuff on.  I told her how insecure I was feeling about that, and she looked at me without hesitation and said &quot;mom, at least your kids like you!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, just like that, she put everything into perspective for me!  I really do feel grateful that my kids like me and that I like them.  A person could have all the money in the world and their kids could absolutely hate them.  It&#39;s been on my mind because of the recent threads on feeling of lack and how it really can be avoided.  My kids are whole and full and so is my life BECAUSE of how we live it!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, while I don&#39;t deny that money can make an unschooling life easier, and that affording opportunities can contribute to a rich full unschooling life, it isn&#39;t everything.  It can be worked around.  Creating peace and optimism and comfort and trusting relationships are bigger and it shows through in times when things are less than ideal.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47752,"nextTopicId":47789}}
