I worked for a woman like this. Not only did she have a maid and TWO <br/>\npersonal secretaries, she had a full-time private chef (M-F), a gardener---and <br/>\nthe gardener&#39;s wife who did the flowers INSIDE the house. There was the <br/>\nforeman, who took care of everything outside (washed the 20 cars and fixed thing <br/>\naround the house, maintained the boats, ran errands, ---did whatever needed to <br/>\nbe done. The massage therapist and the cosmotologist---both of whom worked in <br/>\nthe &quot;salon&quot; attatched to the bedroom, but they weren&#39;t &quot;full-time&quot;. Who else? <br/>\nOH! The LAUNDRESS!!! who just did laundry---no joke! There was the dog <br/>\ntrainer---of five standard poodles (and there daughter had two mini and two toy <br/>\npoodles and a shih tzu)--and of course me, the personal dog groomer. Don&#39;t forget <br/>\nall the &quot;little&quot; people, who weren&#39;t &quot;on staff&quot;---the pool guy and such. And I&#39;m <br/>\nsure I&#39;m forgetting somebody!

Eighteen paychecks!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd she referred to herself as a retired homemaker.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey made a zillions bucks on the stock market. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd they lost it. I&#39;m no longer employed (bummer). They have only the two <br/>\nsecretaries, and the chef on staff now. There&#39;s a 7 million dollar contract on <br/>\nthe house now, because they need to downsize and move to AZ where they won&#39;t be <br/>\nembarrassed to be seen.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yes--retired homemaker. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":118406848,"authorName":"Joylyn","from":"Joylyn &lt;joylyn@...&gt;","profile":"joylynrsf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] what is","postDate":"1060405833","msgId":16037,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNGMzQ4MjQ5LjkwNzA0MDFAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PEJCNTlDRTFGLjM0NTVFJWlrb25zdGl0Y2hlckBjb3gubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":16036,"nextInTopic":16044,"prevInTime":16036,"nextInTime":16038,"topicId":16030,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"A person who won a car on wheel of fortune was introduced as a retired homemaker.
