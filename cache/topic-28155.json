At a very early age we started this metaphor as sunshine and  <br/>\nclouds.   We talked about how we could choose, for the most part, to  <br/>\nhave sunshine on our flower or clouds.  When the clouds came we could  <br/>\nmake the decision to blow them away.  They &quot;got it&quot; right away and  <br/>\nuntil they were 5 or so that&#39;s what we used.  With this metaphor they  <br/>\nwere able, at a very young age, to recognize what was happening and  <br/>\nthey would come to me and say &quot;i have clouds&quot; and together, all three  <br/>\nof us would put our hands up to our mouths, take a deep breath, and  <br/>\nblow the clouds away.  In doing this, they made the decision to be  <br/>\nhappier.  When I read the Native American story it really was just  <br/>\nanother way of saying the sunshine/cloud thing.  They &quot;got it&quot;  <br/>\nimmediately again and even try and show others how to use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see anything wrong with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think that analogies and metaphors are fine for people who can  <br/>\nunderstand them, big or small.  Penelope, at 3 once said to me while  <br/>\ncuddling down to sleep, that people&#39;s minds were like this room (it  <br/>\nwas dark except for the light shining through the open door and we  <br/>\nwere talking about people throwing garbage on the earth), that all  <br/>\nthey need to do (to learn to stop polluting) was open the door.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps metaphors and analogies can be handled just fine by little  <br/>\npeople BECAUSE of their clarity of mind.   Perhaps it is just another  <br/>\npart of the home in which you grow up in.  If metaphors work at 3,  <br/>\nlike walking may work at 7 months for some and reading at 12 for  <br/>\nothers, then why not?

I can&#39;t believe that i used to parent that <br/>\nway all the time! I guess i just lived with the icky feeling! So i <br/>\nimmediately apologized and told him i&#39;d go dig out another sheet in <br/>\nthe closet, and i remade the bed. No big deal. He apologized for not <br/>\nbeing clearer, he said he really thought i knew, esp since i had <br/>\nbeen in the room several times that evening. (He had a point there.)<br/>\nThe rest of our night was fine. Thats the extent of my yelling now, <br/>\nand happens rarely. <br/>\n<br/>\nUsually life is just one big lovefest. My son (who was so angry when <br/>\nhe was younger that he could be physically violent, hurt me, damage <br/>\nproperty)is such a peaceful, loving, empathetic,open kid. He must <br/>\nsay &quot;I love you!!!&quot; 20 times a day, at least. And i&#39;m not longer The <br/>\nMom that Yells. Indeed, he sometimes thanks me for being a great mom!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhats that line? &quot;You&#39;ve come a long way baby!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nKatherine</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28183,"nextTopicId":28195}}
