She looked at this list, but I don&#39;t know whether it helped or not.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/jobs\">http://sandradodd.com/jobs</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve added Robyn Coburn&#39;s list, and another few things I came across, and two things from a concurrent discussion on volunteering.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf people who missed the first discussion would like to look there and send other jobs, I&#39;ll add them.<br/>\n<br/>\nStories of unschoolers&#39; volunteering to help out that turned to a job are welcome, too.  Short stories, for this page, would be better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think maybe there was a list of hospital jobs, or someone mentioned making one, but I didn&#39;t find that.  If anyone knows where it is, I could add that, too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I had hoped for links to &quot;professional&quot; lists of jobs online somewhere, but if they came I might have been too busy or distracted to get the on that page. Help!  <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly spent one day helping a sound engineer who&#39;s starting a home studio, and is going back.  It&#39;s a trial situation to see if he wants to apprentice her.  He&#39;s working for free, at first, to create a body of work, and to practice with his new equipment.  He&#39;s a certified recording engineer, but hasn&#39;t worked independently before.  That&#39;s not &quot;a job,&quot; for Holly, but it&#39;s certainly a learning opportunity!<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s out today with resumes going to hotels.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen i was in the UK last summer talking about jobs my kids had as teens, I was told it&#39;s not legal there, for teens to work.   I think it must be possible for a home educated teen to do volunteer work, or to help out at a business somewhere.  If there are Brit parents here who know, please feel free to jump in here with stories or links.  Even if they can&#39;t be paid before 18, if that&#39;s the law (is it?) they could get experience, somehow, it seems.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":73342,"nextTopicId":73282}}
