I&#39;ve only been reading here for a few weeks<br/>\n&gt; but it has revolutionized the way I parent in a way that I know<br/>\n&gt; therapy could never do - at least not in time for my children to grow<br/>\n&gt; up feeling abundantly loved. I was in therapy when my older kids were<br/>\n&gt; little, mostly for help with parenting. In the one case I received and<br/>\n&gt; followed the worst advice possible re: sleep issues with my son (then<br/>\n&gt; 6) which has caused to him to be afflicted with deep-seated anxiety<br/>\n&gt; about sleeping away from home, even now at 15. The other therapist<br/>\n&gt; really helped me to put some of my own childhood traumas into<br/>\n&gt; perspective and that did help my parenting somewhat...but not in the<br/>\n&gt; all-encompassing way that this list - and Sandra&#39;s & Joyce&#39;s web site<br/>\n&gt; - have done. Unschooling is about a paradigm shift. It has taken me<br/>\n&gt; over a year (since first being exposed to the &quot;radical&quot; unschooling<br/>\n&gt; philosophy) to get to this point of really understanding and embracing<br/>\n&gt; that paradigm, but thanks to people like Sandra and Joyce, I&#39;m here.<br/>\n&gt; And I feel like I&#39;ve finally connected with my real self. Like I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; come home.

If those folks ever want to attend a conference and meet people who unschool and have been unschooling for a long time, spewing gossipy ugliness won&#39;t help.  The unschooling community may seem large and expansive, but it&#39;s not.  There are connections everywhere, in part because of the internet and email groups and online discussions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe truly wonderful long time unschoolers online that give out great advice aren&#39;t going to disappear simply because someone else has deemed them to be &quot;bitchy&quot;.  Lots of email groups have started out of reactionary nonsense like that, and they fizzle out.  I&#39;ve been reading and involved in unschooling discussions since my oldest was 5 and about to enter kindy, so almost 11 yrs.  I make it a point to stay where the good advice is, to keep up with what&#39;s out there in the unschooling world.  I can say, without a doubt, this is the best email group out there.  Unschooling basics is pretty good too, and always unschooled is ok, there is a lot of crossover of writers.  There are a few more out there that are decent.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that there is a lot of crossover, tells me, that nothing I write is secret.  What someone says on one list will eventually make the rounds to other lists.  People know people through strings of connections.  It&#39;s how small populations work.  It&#39;s just better all around to not be gossipy, especially in public.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Invitations to another list","postDate":"1271540626","msgId":52904,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU0NDg5MDhGLTNERTktNEQ5My05OUUwLUZERjQ2ODY4N0YyMEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":52908,"prevInTime":52903,"nextInTime":52905,"topicId":52904,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m sure several of you have been invited on the side to another unschooling list lately.

I  <br/>\nsometimes, but not always, copy them.<br/>\n<br/>\nGoing to another list and speculating isn&#39;t very honorable.  No one  <br/>\ncalled anyone any names here.  No one used any of that language here.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone who wants to go to a hootin&#39; hollerin&#39; complaint session will  <br/>\nprobably get an invitation to it.   I like to think most people would  <br/>\nrather spend time with their children, or in really looking at things  <br/>\nthat would make their children&#39;s lives better than investing time in  <br/>\nhelping others frolic in slanderous nonsense.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this post will be enjoyable to that list for a while, and that  <br/>\nthey&#39;ll leave Pam alone.  I hope Heather and some others will feel  <br/>\nashamed of their treatment of people who have spent many hours  <br/>\noffering them help in the past.  I hope some of the people on that  <br/>\nlist will see the damage they are doing to their own souls and psyches  <br/>\nand integrity by being any part of such a wankfest.  Their children&#39;s  <br/>\nlives are not enriched a single bit by their mothers spending time so  <br/>\nhorribly badmouthing other unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/negativity\">http://sandradodd.com/negativity</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here&#39;s some feedback on this allegedly abusive group:<br/>\n<br/>\n** This list (Always Learning) is better for helping people get to  <br/>\nunschooling than anything else available anywhere else in the world.**<br/>\nI absolutely believe this. I&#39;ve only been reading here for a few weeks  <br/>\nbut it has revolutionized the way I parent in a way that I know  <br/>\ntherapy could never do - at least not in time for my children to grow  <br/>\nup feeling abundantly loved. I was in therapy when my older kids were  <br/>\nlittle, mostly for help with parenting. In the one case I received and  <br/>\nfollowed the worst advice possible re: sleep issues with my son (then  <br/>\n6) which has caused to him to be afflicted with deep-seated anxiety  <br/>\nabout sleeping away from home, even now at 15. The other therapist  <br/>\nreally helped me to put some of my own childhood traumas into  <br/>\nperspective and that did help my parenting somewhat...but not in the  <br/>\nall-encompassing way that this list - and Sandra&#39;s & Joyce&#39;s web site  <br/>\n- have done. Unschooling is about a paradigm shift. It has taken me  <br/>\nover a year (since first being exposed to the &quot;radical&quot; unschooling  <br/>\nphilosophy) to get to this point of really understanding and embracing  <br/>\nthat paradigm, but thanks to people like Sandra and Joyce, I&#39;m here.  <br/>\nAnd I feel like I&#39;ve finally connected with my real self. Like I&#39;ve  <br/>\ncome home. And it is such a relief! :D<br/>\n<br/>\n~Leah<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/feedback\">http://sandradodd.com/feedback</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52978,"nextTopicId":52919}}
