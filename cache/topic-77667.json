Don’t balance it. Prevent it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could make it part of the condition of his sports activity that he NOT bring the school-style behaviors home.  Yes, school has a hierarchy and accepts low-level bullying because there is high-level bullying to contrast it with.  You don’t need to “balance” that in an unschooling home.  You can say “keep it at school.”<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Yes, maybe I am not involved enough throughout the day.  Will likes to spend a lot of time in his room, by himself, usually texting and snapchatting with friends or watching videos on youtube.  He talks to me about his conversations and which friends he talks to the most, but I am certainly not involved directly in the conversations.  There have been some very tough situations where he has had to completely block a friend because of bullying and during those situations, I do sit and read the text conversations with him.   Sometimes I think about his life-- sports for 3 hours every evening and most of the weekend days, up late on social media with friends at night, waking around noon, reading and watching sports replays for a couple hours, playing with brothers, getting ready to go back to sports again... and I wish we had more time to do other things.  He wants to do the sports.  But I could be bringing more in.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could arrange an overnight or weekend road trip with him.  That can be extremely therapeutic for a parent/child dyad.  Drive far, do something very cool (sports event, concert, play, or a museum related to his interests).  Stay in a hotel.  Eat in restaurants.  Vacation.  Drive back.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe event will creat a memory.  The drive will provide time to relax and talk without “sitting down to talk.”  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/truck\">http://sandradodd.com/truck</a><br/>\nPlease read that.

It’s biology too. Kids in the 11-14 year range can become very concerned about whether they’re up to speed with their peers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn social mammals, adolescence is when the juveniles join the adults in adult work, under supervision.

What can I do to be ready to contribute to the group?”<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course our society isn’t set up so that childhood flows into real contributing work with a child&#39;s tribe. But it doesn’t stop biology from starting the process! I would bet that his strong draw to sports teams coincides with a strong need to compare himself to them. He’s subconsciously asking if he’s ready to fit in. And he’s feeling he isn’t. He isn’t doing what they’re doing. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the more you can *reasonably* support him in exploring what he believes will help will help.

His older brother definitely was not at that age.  But Will certainly is!!  He has never been to school.  He is a highly driven kid.   He loves playing basketball and baseball.  He joined a higher level team for each sport about 2 years ago.  He is the only unschooler on either team, there is 1 school-at-home kid on one of the teams.  Since joining these teams, these issues have surfaced.  The coaches tell the kids they are preparing them for high school sports.  Will is playing because he loves playing with kids who love playing as much as he does.   He loves the challenge.  His favorite thing is to push his body further than he thought possible.   He does not have to attend high school to play sports on a high school team here in Colorado.  I have explained to him that we can continue to unschool and he can try out for local high school teams anyway.<br><br></div>Ever since joining these teams, he has become interested in what it would be like to be part of a school crowd.  A lot of the boys on his baseball team talk about having girlfriends, and for a little while, he decided to try out dating a girl who was a friend of a friend.  He went to movies and out to meals on dates.  Then he decided that he wasn&#39;t ready for that kind of thing and broke it off.  Kids ask him things like what is your favorite subject, where are you going to high school?  He has developed answers to these questions that make him feel comfortable socially, but he still questions these things himself, at home, with me.  <br><br></div>He has a group of friends who live locally and who are homeschoolers.  But none of them are unschoolers.  One has a private tutor to keep up with grade level.  Another follows an online curriculum.  Another does &quot;school&quot; everyday until noon and then has freedom in the afternoons.  He was never bothered to compare himself to other kids until recently.  He became acutely aware that his handwriting looked younger than his friends&#39;.  Since then, he has practiced writing almost daily for 2 years and now has beautiful handwriting that he is proud of.  He decided to learn cursive recently so that he could read cursive handwriting.  <br><br></div>I think he has conversations with his homeschooling friends, who lately have become competitive with each other, about grade levels and skills.  He asked to do the curriculum that 2 of these friends were doing so that he could also be ready for high school.  All of his homeschool friends plan to go to high school.  I think they text about how much fun it will be to go to school together when they are in high school.  I am definitely not pushing him to go to high school.  <br> <br><div><div><div><div><div><div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-190445628gmail_extra\"><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-190445628gmail_quote\"><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-190445628gmail_quote\" style=\"margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-left:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);padding-left:1ex;\"><div style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-190445628gmail-m_-3951896143787029606ygrp-mlmsg\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-190445628gmail-m_-3951896143787029606ygrp-msg\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-190445628gmail-m_-3951896143787029606ygrp-text\"><p>\nIs there someone doing to him what you say he is doing to his younger brothers?<br>\nDon’t let him do that.

In the absence of legal birth control (whether in time, or in locale), once people are married, they’re likely to have a baby, that means some opportunitites are shut down for a while.  If a family wanted to help a son, especially, to be able to be a responsible father and husband, he needed to have a career before he got married.   Many things are different now.  Lots of things have changed, and it gives us all, older parents, young adults, teens, many more options.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Career ideas","postDate":"1485659758","msgId":77788,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgwNDZCQUE2LTg5NzMtNDI0NC04RjI5LTc5RjQxQTgyNTAwMEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG82ajR1disxcDU4YnF0QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PERGMkNEQkFGLUE3NTUtNDA3OS04NkY5LTEyMkREMjQyNzE2MEBnbWFpbC5jb20+IDxDQVB6aExxeGNNU2dCMmo1Wkw3R01yRW5vbk5DWHA5SEFvOTN0QjVBSkRMRi1jU0VMY3dAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+IDwzRDBFNEE0QS02ODY5LTQ4MzctQkU4NS1FMzY1RjM5Njg2QUNAc2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDxDQVB6aExxeEpabThuR2lNMWd6Rk5waFI9S3c3eUhIQWJaNmt5ZTdKNTRKY3pZMURGR1FAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+IDxvNmo0dXYrMXA1OGJxdEBZYWhvb0dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":77786,"nextInTopic":77789,"prevInTime":77787,"nextInTime":77789,"topicId":77667,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Also, unschoolers who have stepped away from the conveyor belt and schedule of school years and ages could relax about *when* a child goes to college, if at","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-537825223\">Also, unschoolers who have stepped away from the conveyor belt and schedule of school years and ages could relax about *when* a child goes to college, if at all.

The interest gained on having had dthat money in savings (CDs, bonds) is probably better than student loan interest, too.

Sometimes, the opportunity cost can lead to buyer&#39;s remorse, when a person suddenly wishes they had reserved the resources allocated to the first choice to the second choice instead. I don&#39;t think anyone is immune to that, no matter how they spend their childhood. <br><br></div>I grew up in New England but I never learned to downhill ski. It was expensive and I didn&#39;t like sports and my parents didn&#39;t ski, so it just didn&#39;t happen. I went through a period in my teens where I was really mad at my mom for not &quot;making me&quot; go to skiing lessons. I hadn&#39;t wanted to take the time to learn to ski, but I was mad that I didn&#39;t magically know how to ski without doing the work. There have been a few times in my life when I have thought, gee, I wish I could ski, but I know that if I *really* wanted to ski, I could go take lessons. As an adult, I have been pleased to realize that it&#39;s never too late to learn something I want to learn. I can&#39;t remember whether it was here or on some other list where one of the contributors was talking about how the idea that we can&#39;t learn as well after a certain age is a really poisonous thought to hold onto, because it makes us feel a sense of urgency or helplessness that there is going to be a magic window that closes and we won&#39;t ever be able to learn something really new.<br><br></div>Sometimes my kids get frustrated that they don&#39;t already know how to do something. Most of the time, it is a passing thing - they experiment with it for a while and then move on. Once in a while, it really clicks and they dig in and get through the steep curve at the beginning. Maybe just helping a child get through the steep curve if they ask for help, or even taking on something new and hard yourself at the same time to be a partner in that particular phase of learning, can help them see that there&#39;s never a point that you have all the tools already - there are always more to gather. And maybe pointing out all the wonderful things they have in their lives because they weren&#39;t focused on basic math when tsunamis or Atlantis or Minecraft were more interesting, can help support them in the ongoing maturation process?<br><br></div>Sarah<br></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1115488410gmail_extra\"><br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1115488410gmail_quote\">On Sat, Jan 28, 2017 at 5:11 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:semajrak@...\">semajrak@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] <span dir=\"ltr\">&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-1115488410gmail_quote\" style=\"margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;\">\n\n\n<u></u>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n<div style=\"background-color:#fff;\">\n<span style=\"display:none;\"> </span>\n\n\n<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1115488410m_-1171714986887429592ygrp-mlmsg\">\n  <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1115488410m_-1171714986887429592ygrp-msg\">\n\n\n    <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1115488410m_-1171714986887429592ygrp-text\">\n      \n      \n      <p><span style=\"color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:georgia;\">***But if one child wants to earn a degree, but feels the task is just too big of a hurdle to cross because he has not taken all the baby steps to get him there, is that having served that child&#39;s best interests?***</span><br style=\"color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:georgia;\"></p><div style=\"color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia;font-size:13px;\"><br></span></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia;font-size:13px;\">What if, instead of earning a degree, your child wanted to spend four years exploring the world?  If the child had not taken a lifetime of baby steps to prepare for that, how would you help them?  What if the child wanted to spend four years at sea?  Four years planning and building their own house?  Four years researching for and making a documentary?  </span></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia;font-size:13px;\"><br></span></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia;font-size:13px;\">There are many things one can decide to do that takes preparation for getting started and involves making a lot mistakes and having some frustrating learning opportunities to start.  If a person really wants to pursue something, they will carry on past that to learn to be proficient and possibly excel beyond their own expectations.

It came up because of this experiment of trying community college.  Many other homeschoolers he knows are doing this program where the state pays for you to go to community college.  He decided to give it a try.  He has never been to school in his life.  So this is his first exposure to a text book and a teacher.   Last semester he tried a history class.  He is interested in history in general, but then after the course, he determined that while the history itself is interesting, he really does not enjoy reading textbooks about history, and especially really did not enjoy writing papers about it.  He enjoyed hearing what the professor had to say, but he did not want to read or write about it.  <br><br>He wanted to try a science this semester.  He wanted chemistry, but he didn&#39;t have the math level to take chemistry, so he decided on biology.  It is a pretty intense class.  He wants to do well but he is having a hard time with the reading and the lectures.  I&#39;ve been talking with him about his learning style and figuring out strategies that work best for him.  It isn&#39;t that I am pushing him to pick a career right now.  Instead, he is making the connection that when he is passionate about it, he learns minute details about the subject easily.  But when it isn&#39;t coming from within, he starts to get very tired and his brain shuts down.  I do think he is wondering how on earth he will get through 4 years of college to get a degree in something at this rate.  He has the expectation that he will get a college degree and I think that is why he is starting down this path.  He is interested in knowing how many courses he needs to take to get a degree.  But he is not loving all of it.  It does bring up lots of questions.<br><br></div><div style=\"background-color:#fff;\">I don&#39;t want to suggest to him to quit just because he doesn&#39;t enjoy it so far.  I am helping him immensely with the biology course, helping him read the text, showing him what I would write down as notes to study later, explaining concepts to him.  He has never mentioned quitting.  I have been telling him stories about people I know who have fulfilling and lucrative careers without degrees, so that he knows that is an option.  We talk to lots of people about how they ended up in the careers they are in.  It has led to many interesting conversations.  Everyone on both sides of his family has PhD, JD or masters degrees.  I don&#39;t want him to think that because he doesn&#39;t have experience with how to do school-type studying and didn&#39;t get used to the monotony of jumping through hoops to get a degree, that he&#39;s at a disadvantage.  He does not know how to be a diligent student.  He is, by nature, not an organized person.  He throws important papers in amidst the coin roll scraps in his room and forgets about them.  When I ask if he wants help organizing a notebook to keep track of the papers from class, he always says yes.  It is really difficult for him to do without significant help.  I have been looking at all the help that we are giving him as part of his process of learning how to be a student at school.  It is not much like the type of learning he is used to living (in the wild).  I&#39;m not even sure much of it is learning about the topics he is studying!  I&#39;m surprised that it seems very much like school as I remember it-- figuring out what you need to do or know to pass the class and doing just that.  I wonder how long he will continue to take these courses.<br><br><br></div><div
