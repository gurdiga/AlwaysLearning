But that&#39;s a <br/>\ntwo-car-garage-sized room and hasn&#39;t been cleaned (except vacuuming) for a long <br/>\ntime.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s boring. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty and Holly are a couple of miles away with eight or so friends, to play <br/>\norc ball.  Today they&#39;re being photographed for some local sports newspaper <br/>\nI&#39;ve never seen.  Marty thought he was going to be asked to write up the history <br/>\nand rules of the game, but they&#39;ve already interviewed him so he didn&#39;t need <br/>\nto write it himself.  He wasn&#39;t worried about it, though.  He was very matter <br/>\nof fact both ways.  So his first-ever report being for publication didn&#39;t <br/>\nscare him, and he seemed to show no disappointment or relief at finding he didn&#39;t <br/>\nneed to.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday he and Holly and I went to thrift stores looking for &quot;uniforms&quot; for <br/>\nthem.  He had hoped for short-sleeved button-up shirts, some green and some <br/>\nblue, and didn&#39;t find what he wanted.  But he DID find five black net loose <br/>\nover-shirt things specifically for team-marking.  Does anyone know what those are <br/>\ncalled?  He&#39;s interested in buying some more, but two big sporting goods <br/>\nstores didn&#39;t have any.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the teams are usually five people and that was perfect, and he decided the <br/>\ncheapest quickest other thing would be to get some white mens&#39; t-shirts and <br/>\ndye them gold or green.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen Holly said if he got white t-shirts for everyone, some could have black <br/>\nover and some not, but then they wouldn&#39;t have to switchback and forth if <br/>\neverybody had a white t-shirt on.  And lots of them already have white t-shirts.  <br/>\nSo he bought five extra just in case (used).<br/>\n<br/>\nI made them both lunch while they were waiting for the other players, but I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t eat. Then Keith came in and ate leftovers while I was doing carpet and <br/>\nso I haven&#39;t eaten.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey all went off in white a while ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby is at work at the gaming shop.  He drove himself, but I have to go to <br/>\nride next to him (learner&#39;s permit) and bring the van home.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith helped a friend in Belen (south of here half an hour) load a moving <br/>\nvan.  The friend&#39;s car is in our back yard for a few days.  He brought back a few <br/>\npieces of garage furniture and oddments.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI like these days where people are doing important things and are scattered <br/>\nout.  I like the all-together days, too, but as the kids are getting older I&#39;m <br/>\ncoming to really appreciate seeing them use the house as a base of interesting <br/>\noperations.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh.  I went to Cost Plus to buy some Japanese snack food.  Party mixes of <br/>\ncute various rice-cakey things, and one that said &quot;nuts&quot; but looks like nuts I <br/>\nnever saw before.  Some new teaspoons because we are low on teaspoons.   And ten <br/>\npacks of Pocky which we plan to put out in pretty goblets.  And he wants an <br/>\nice cream cake.  So that&#39;s Tuesday.   He&#39;ll have people from gaming, anime, <br/>\nkarate, homeschooling and SCA.  Some of those overlap two groups and a couple <br/>\noverlap three (other SCA homeschooler gamers).  I expect there&#39;ll be 20 or 25 <br/>\nextra people.  Some are coming from Los Alamos, some of the group he went to the <br/>\nprom with.  There will be at least two from Santa Fe, and maybe six.  Some are <br/>\ncoming from the east side of the mountains, Stanley and Edgewood.  Some might <br/>\nspend the night, probably the girls from Los Alamos.  I think it&#39;s slightly <br/>\nover half males, because the gaming shop and karate class have more male <br/>\nparticipants.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15762,"nextTopicId":14921}}
