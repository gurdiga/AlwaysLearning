Perhaps instead of <br/>\nthinking positive thoughts, in a general sense, think something positive about <br/>\neach of your kids.  Teen girls can be emotional and needy.  When I&#39;m feeling <br/>\noverwhelmed by that, it helps for me to re frame the way that I&#39;m seeing things. <br/>\n I take a huge deep breath and turn towards something different, something <br/>\npleasant, then I think as many positive things about my girl, so that when I <br/>\nturn to face her, I&#39;m seeing her as those things instead of the negative <br/>\nintensity that I&#39;d just felt.  I&#39;ll tell a joke or ask a question and then let <br/>\nher talk so that I can listen, and while that&#39;s happening, I&#39;ll do something for <br/>\nher like make her a snack or pick up her room or find something funny online to <br/>\nshow her.  About half an hour later, she&#39;s no longer feeling emotional and <br/>\nneedy, and I&#39;m no longer annoyed by it!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t take but a moment to change the whole atmosphere around me.  It only <br/>\ntakes a moment to reconnect and find something joyful.  In fact, it takes far <br/>\nmore time to walk away and be upset about it. <br/>\n<br/>\n***We are doing alot of movie watch to connect, but the guilt of TV watching<br/>\nduring the day is something fierce..not to mention the &quot;schoolwork&#39; we dont<br/>\nhave much of a social life as everybody is in school during the week and<br/>\nweekends is family, so we are a bit desprete for freinds.***<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is there guilt watching TV during the day?  Does it have to be TV, can it be <br/>\nmovies online or youtube videos?  What about music videos, or music sharing?  <br/>\n<br/>\nNot knowing the laws in South Africa, why are you doing schoolwork?  Is it <br/>\nsomething that needs to happen?  Is it open and flexible?  Can movies be a part <br/>\nof the schoolwork?  Does the weekend have to be family?  Can the girls find <br/>\nfriends to include in family?  That would make it really difficult to have a <br/>\nsocial life as a teen, if weekends were out.  My oldest has several friends that <br/>\nshe loves to spend time with.  The ONLY way that we were able to make it happen <br/>\nwas to be hugely flexible about when we were available.  Since her friends <br/>\nmostly go to school, and have homework and other obligations, it helped that we <br/>\ncould work around their schedules with our flexible one.  If weekends were out, <br/>\nshe wouldn&#39;t have many friends, honestly, and not because her friends didn&#39;t <br/>\nlike her or want to spend time with her, but because for school kids, weekends <br/>\nARE the time they can hang out and do things.<br/>\n<br/>\nDesperation isn&#39;t good for unschooling.  If the girls are desperate for friends, <br/>\nthen make it happen.  Open the weekend if you need to.  Once the girls are <br/>\nfeeling less desperate, you may find that you like them more, they&#39;ll be more <br/>\njoyful.  They&#39;ll come home and tell you fun stories and you&#39;ll get to meet <br/>\ninteresting kids and they&#39;ll be able to share different food ideas and different <br/>\nmusic and movies and all sorts of cool things like that.  That&#39;s what happens <br/>\nwhen you meet new people, they bring newness and ideas into your lives.  It&#39;s <br/>\nespecially important for teenagers to experience that if that is what they want. <br/>\n Some teens don&#39;t care too much about all that, but if you have ones that do, it <br/>\ncan make the difference between peace and joy in your house, or resentment and <br/>\nunhappiness with a potential of the kids going to school.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":405463163,"authorName":"Susan Steynberg","from":"Susan Steynberg &lt;suzisword@...&gt;","profile":"suzisword","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] forcing TO do vs forcing NOT TO do....evolved \tfrom unschooling -was gun play","postDate":"1279886248","msgId":56342,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlsSV9jNHJzRGNrLUpCOXlzdXhNdGY3cF9CMHdRVXEtMjlqNk55M0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDRBQTAyQkYyMUY5NjQzMTVCODJGM0NBN0MwMEYxQjM1QEx5bGFQQz4=","referencesHeader":"PEU4RjAyQjcwMDQyODRDMzdBNDAxOEQ1MDg4QUE1RUNFQFBIUFZpZGVvVkFJTz4JPDk1NDcyNS4yNzc3OC5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwMS5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+CTw0RDg3MDYyMS01Qzc4LTQ5Q0ItOURCNC04MEQxNkQzQzlBRDZAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+CTw0QzNBQTg2Ni4zMDEwODA5QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+CTxBQU5Ma1Rpa2tleW5faHltTEF5RXl0SG9LdVE5TGVTNGRvS1I1Nm9ZaFNubThAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+CTxBQU5Ma1Rpa0N6ZUVOMU90bzlabmNsVW9nTl93c19EMlpYRTZhdTh2eUxuUWlAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+CTw0QUEwMkJGMjFGOTY0MzE1QjgyRjNDQTdDMDBGMUIzNUBMeWxhUEM+"},"prevInTopic":55958,"nextInTopic":56347,"prevInTime":56341,"nextInTime":56343,"topicId":55837,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi All ive just found this post, i was searching for the replys to my questions. i found it in my sentbox.Thank you for the links and the answers. i feel like ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1335068952\">Hi All<br/>\n<br/>\nive just found this post, i was searching for the replys to my questions. i<br/>\nfound it in my sentbox.Thank you for the links and the answers. i feel like<br/>\nim getting a do over with my son, but it feels overwhelming with the girls.<br/>\ni have a really negative thought pattern when it gets to the girls and i<br/>\nhave alot of guilt cuz im surposed to love being with my girls but i dont. i<br/>\nwas away for a day and riding back i realised how i hated going home to<br/>\nthem. how do i love being with them???? do i have to fake it until i feel<br/>\nit??? is something seriously wrong with me or are we just going through a<br/>\nrough patch.

That&#39;s part of <br/>\ntrusting a person, knowing that they may do what you don&#39;t want them to do.  The <br/>\ndifference will be in what you do AFTER that happens.  If you accept it as a <br/>\nmistake to learn from, something to talk about and not something that vindicates <br/>\nyou, as the parent, or gives you cause to shame and control, you&#39;ll be one step <br/>\nin proving to your kids that they can be trusted and that YOU can be trusted.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband just got a birthday present.  We helped him get some very very cheap <br/>\nmusical equipment.  A parent put them up for sale to punish his kid for smoking <br/>\npot.  We went back and forth on whether we wanted any part in that, but the <br/>\nprice was something we could afford right now and so far from what something <br/>\nlike that would go for, even used.  The kid wasn&#39;t home and didn&#39;t know what he <br/>\nwas going home to.  I&#39;m sure it was yucky.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the thing, that kid isn&#39;t going to learn that smoking pot is bad and <br/>\nchange his behavior.  He&#39;s going to learn that his parents are mean and <br/>\nvindictive, that they have no understanding, that they are inflexible, not to be <br/>\ntrusted, and people that aren&#39;t to be relied on as a soft landing when things <br/>\nget hard.  Kids make mistakes.  People make mistakes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you make a mistake in your relationship, how do you want your husband to <br/>\nrespond to it?  Do you want him to take away your phone privilege, or tell you <br/>\nthat you can&#39;t go out for coffee with your best girl friend because you <br/>\nneglected to do the dishes and cook dinner?  I&#39;m not even saying that those <br/>\nthings are mistakes in a relationship, but if it&#39;s what you usually do and if <br/>\nit&#39;s expected and you don&#39;t do it, it could feel that way.  It would be <br/>\nmanipulative and controlling, the same thing that you are trying to do to your <br/>\nkids to get them to do what you want them to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I look into these kinds of relationships, where the parents are punitive <br/>\nand inflexible, and/or controlling and manipulative, the most immediate thing <br/>\nthat I notice that can change is for a parent to take the time to listen, even <br/>\nwhen the child is angry and disrespectful.  Listen.  Don&#39;t react, just listen, <br/>\nand hear the words that are being said behind the emotions.  Take that to heart. <br/>\n Those strong emotions are there because the child feels disrespected deeply and <br/>\nwounded from your actions and inactions.  THAT is really really hard to hear, <br/>\nbut hearing it could very well be the thing that changes everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next time one of your girls is angry or rebellious or disrespectful towards <br/>\nyou, take a deep breath and listen and then ask them for a remedy to the <br/>\nsituation.  Ask them how they want it to be different.  Then DO that.  Actions <br/>\nspeak so much louder than words, even apologies.  Apologies mean nothing without <br/>\naction.  Undoing damage will take time and continuous action on your part to do <br/>\nbetter.  The onus is on you. <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: forcing TO do vs forcing NOT TO do....evolved from unschooling -was gun play","postDate":"1278958837","msgId":55918,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGkxZm1kbCtqZ3FqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlra2V5bl9oeW1MQXlFeXRIb0t1UTlMZVM0ZG9LUjU2b1loU25tOEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":55906,"nextInTopic":55919,"prevInTime":55917,"nextInTime":55919,"topicId":55837,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I don&#39;t think my husband would be <br/>\nokay with them dating until their 18. We haven&#39;t really discussed it, since it <br/>\njust hasn&#39;t come up. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nWere you allowed to date and have sex?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a whole forest by my house full of used condoms and underwear of <br/>\nteenagers having sex, hiding it from those that think they shouldn&#39;t be.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they aren&#39;t allowed to date or have sex, and they find someone in which <br/>\nthey&#39;d like to do both, they WILL hide it.  It&#39;s such a huge and powerful thing, <br/>\nbiologically driven, that I don&#39;t think any parent can prevent it, even if they <br/>\nthink they are and have good reasons for doing so.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think one of the things our culture does to teens that is hugely damaging, is <br/>\nto not believe in their ability to be in healthy lasting relationships.  It <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t necessarily mean forever relationships, but teens can be in committed <br/>\nrelationships, they can communicate and work things out.  So many parents don&#39;t <br/>\nbelieve this and diminish this potential by thinking things like &quot;puppy love&quot; or <br/>\nother diminutive sorts of ideas about teens and relationships.  In many ways <br/>\nit&#39;s created teens that will only do short term non-committal relationships, <br/>\nlike fads of jeans, they trade it in for the next one.  Those kinds of <br/>\nrelationships, I think, are more painful and damaging.<br/>\n<br/>\nDating can be casual, get to know the other person kind of things.  That&#39;s not <br/>\nwhat I&#39;m talking about though.  If your girls aren&#39;t interested, then no big <br/>\ndeal.  Chamille wasn&#39;t interested at all, and it hit her hard when she or we <br/>\nweren&#39;t expecting it at all.  Chamille was never one of those girls swooning <br/>\nover all the cute boys.  She was never thinking about the day that she &quot;finally&quot; <br/>\nhad a boyfriend.  She just wanted friends and it didn&#39;t matter if they were boys <br/>\nor girls, she just wanted friends with common interests, what she found was a <br/>\nboy in which they were immediately drawn together, very powerfully.  Neither one <br/>\nof them expected that.  They&#39;ve been together for 1.25 yrs.  Chamille is 16 and <br/>\nher boyfriend is 14.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey aren&#39;t always mature, they get in arguments, they cry and sometimes are <br/>\noverly emotional with each other, BUT they work things out, sometimes more <br/>\nmaturely than some adults I know.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal belief is that, parents shouldn&#39;t enforce abstinence, but discuss <br/>\nsex in realistic ways.  Helping kids know how to say &quot;no&quot; or &quot;yes&quot; in a healthy <br/>\nway goes a lot farther than saying &quot;no, wrong, shouldn&#39;t do it, don&#39;t do it.&quot; <br/>\n That cuts off communication surrounding sex and relationships.  Most parents <br/>\nwould rather be in the &quot;know&quot; in that regard, for many reasons, one being <br/>\nmedical, and another being safety, and the biggest, to prevent pregnancies that <br/>\naren&#39;t wanted.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s *my* opinion.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of our neighbor&#39;s daughters got pregnant and didn&#39;t tell anyone until it was <br/>\nwell past the time she could have an abortion, didn&#39;t want to have a baby, but <br/>\nwas afraid to tell her dad that she&#39;d gotten pregnant because she wasn&#39;t <br/>\nsupposed to be having sex.  She was 16 and hid her pregnancy until it was no <br/>\nlonger possible to do so.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***The girls were horrified, lol. So, I kind of struggle with that as well. I <br/>\nwant them to have the information well ahead of when they&#39;ll actually need it. <br/>\nBut it&#39;s hard to know when the right time is to share things like that with <br/>\nthem.***<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they were horrified, find a better way!  We&#39;ve always talked about sex in a <br/>\nvery candid way at our house.  When the kids are small, give small simple <br/>\nanswers, as they get older give bigger and more complex answers, as long as they <br/>\nare receptive.  My kids have always been receptive, in part because we are <br/>\ncandid about it.  Chamille is the most private person about &quot;body&quot; anything, yet <br/>\nwe still find ways to talk about this sort of thing because it&#39;s valuable <br/>\ninformation, just like any other valuable life learning thing! <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":214171486,"authorName":"Heather","from":"Heather &lt;swingdancechick@...&gt;","profile":"heather_200115","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] teens and girl-boy stuff","postDate":"1278881334","msgId":55862,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlsV2RtVWRWTHZ3dUxPTmJhRW5iRmdLTUh3elJuaXl1WHE0cDFqa0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlsYldJeFY0bnhIYzJndjNTamY0ci1Yei1FYmdLMFk2d011eldiRUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGkxY2tqbyt2Zm9uQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8aTFkNDlsK2MxbzZAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+CTxBQU5Ma1RpbGJXSXhWNG54SGMyZ3YzU2pmNHItWHotRWJnSzBZNndNdXpXYkVAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":55861,"nextInTopic":55868,"prevInTime":55861,"nextInTime":55863,"topicId":55837,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oh, I meant to share this...

But after a while, eating so much yummy vegetarian food, the meat just become unappealing. So that wasn&#39;t really a big deal for us. I do, however, sometimes wonder how to deal with &quot;boys&quot;. We have 3 girls and our oldest is 14. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince the girls haven&#39;t been to public school in over 3 years, and we moved about 8 months ago, they just haven&#39;t had any opportunities to be seriously interested in any boys. That&#39;s a relief to me. But, I do wonder the best way to handle that as they get older. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m kind of torn in my thinking. On the one hand, I think it&#39;s probably better if they explore relationships while they&#39;re here with us, so that we can be there for them. On the other hand, I became pregnant with our oldest when I was 16, so &quot;boyfriends&quot; scare me a little. I don&#39;t think my husband would be okay with them dating until their 18. We haven&#39;t really discussed it, since it just hasn&#39;t come up. <br/>\n<br/>\nI talk to my girls sometimes about sex and relationships. The first time I had sex, I didn&#39;t really mean to. It progressed from making out to sex so quickly I was truly taken by surprise. So, when the topic comes up I&#39;ll talk to them about how to avoid situations like that so you don&#39;t have sex before you are ready. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe last time we talked about sex, I explained that sperm could leak out at any time during sex, not just &quot;at the end&quot;, and that sometimes it can be hard for a guy to stop, so that&#39;s why it&#39;s important for a guy to use a condom the entire time. The girls were horrified, lol. So, I kind of struggle with that as well. I want them to have the information well ahead of when they&#39;ll actually need it. But it&#39;s hard to know when the right time is to share things like that with them. <br/>\n<br/>\n~ Amanda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] forcing TO do vs forcing NOT TO do....evolved from unschooling -was gun play","postDate":"1278851075","msgId":55838,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc1NjlFRDM3LTM2NDMtNEU3Ny05OUY0LTI1QjYyQUY2ODZDNEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEU4RjAyQjcwMDQyODRDMzdBNDAxOEQ1MDg4QUE1RUNFQFBIUFZpZGVvVkFJTz4=","referencesHeader":"PEU4RjAyQjcwMDQyODRDMzdBNDAxOEQ1MDg4QUE1RUNFQFBIUFZpZGVvVkFJTz4="},"prevInTopic":55837,"nextInTopic":55841,"prevInTime":55837,"nextInTime":55839,"topicId":55837,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
