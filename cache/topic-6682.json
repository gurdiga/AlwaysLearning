Anyway, I wasn&#39;t there at the time, but I<br/>\nheard later (from my SIL who worked there) that a boy<br/>\ncame in to check it out, maybe 12 years old, and the<br/>\nlibrarian told him NO, he was not allowed to check<br/>\nthat out without his mother&#39;s permission, and why did<br/>\nhe want to know about that dirty stuff, anyway??

It was beautiful.  We went to one of the<br/>\ncemeteries there looking for good stones to rub, took two rubbings, very<br/>\nnice from Russian stones, from 1872.  Ate our lunch at the big park there<br/>\nand Dylan got in on a game of soccer.  They were all adults, and I was<br/>\nsure he&#39;d get creamed, but he survived, had fun and is talking about<br/>\njoining a team this fall.   <br/>\nThey are rebuilding the historic Columbia Gardens, in Butte.  The carved<br/>\ncarousel horses are on display at the mall there.  They&#39;re so beautiful,<br/>\nyou can even go watch the guy as he works on them.  It&#39;s amazing.  When<br/>\nyou come through Butte in June on your way to the sustainability fair,<br/>\nyou should check it out.  <br/>\n <br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6678,"nextTopicId":6638}}
