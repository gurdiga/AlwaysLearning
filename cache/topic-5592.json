I took both girls to Tampa (12-hour drive) without dh.  He&#39;s home <br/>\nsick now, poor guy.  I missed you all and it is sure nice to &quot;hear your <br/>\nvoices&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI need to get started on the spring cleaning stuff, too.  I have noticed that <br/>\nkitchen items are migrating to other cabinets and I am wondering if this is <br/>\nthe result of mating season for appliances or just my imagination.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI took the girls to the local kids museum yesterday...lo, and behold, it was <br/>\npacked with elemetary school kids as far as the eye could see.  Mira (4.5, <br/>\nwho let me know on Sunday that &quot;if you would just let me do everything I want <br/>\nto do, Mommy, we would be fine&quot;) said, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t want to go to school.  <br/>\nThose kids are loud and pushy.&quot;  Hurray for us!  I told her I would not be <br/>\nsending her to school.  She was so glad!  She just hugged me for  a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\nCongratulations Sandra and Mary!  You&#39;&#39;ve re-entered the vortex.  Maybe I <br/>\nwill get over there again now that the support is available.  (Hugs to you)<br/>\n<br/>\nReenie, thanks for all the cool sites.  I am going to be checking them out <br/>\nfor days!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again, all.  I feel like I am &quot;home&quot; when I read your messages.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiAnna</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5578,"nextTopicId":5583}}
