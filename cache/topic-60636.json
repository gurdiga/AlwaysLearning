Although he refused to specify the contents of  O.T. materials, on the <br/>\nground that it offended Scientologists, he said,  “If they’d sprung this stuff <br/>\non me when I first walked in the door, I  just would have laughed and left right <br/>\naway.” But by the time Haggis  approached the O.T. III material he’d already <br/>\nbeen through several years  of auditing. His wife was deeply involved in the <br/>\nchurch, as was his  sister Kathy. Moreover, his first writing jobs had come <br/>\nthrough  Scientology connections. He was now entrenched in the community. <br/>\nSuccess  stories in the Scientology magazine Advance! added an aura of  reality <br/>\nto the church’s claims. Haggis admits, “I was looking forward to  enhanced <br/>\nabilities.” Moreover, he had invested a lot of money in the  program. The <br/>\nincentive to believe was high.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRead more <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/02/14/110214fa_fact_wright#ixzz1Jlkbzakj\">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/02/14/110214fa_fact_wright#ixzz1Jlkbzakj</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe that&#39;s part of why Waldorf keeps media from children, to make them more <br/>\ncommitted to believing than they might otherwise be.

We choose that school because in the Netherlands homeschool is a very difficult option (only 330 children get it) and it was the school where there was the most outside play (my daughter loves to be outside). She loved to paint, draw etc , but within two months she stopped painting and drawing. I didn&#39;t notice it so much but when I asked her on a rainy sunday if we could paint together she said: I can&#39;t paint because I&#39;m not yet 5 years old. In the school they allowed children only to use paint when they were 5, starting with only yellow.

We lasted exactly one meeting before we became<br/>\nWaldorf-school dropouts :-)  We hadn&#39;t realized when we enrolled how<br/>\nvery restrictive some of their ideas and policies are  once we<br/>\nrealized, we knew it wasn&#39;t for us at ALL.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is an excerpt from their media policy (as set forth in their parent<br/>\nhandbook).  Thought folks might find it interesting <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The debilitating effects of media on children&#39;s developing<br/>\ncapacities are increasingly apparent to us, and are well documented by<br/>\nindependent researchers. By &quot;media&quot; we mean the full array of<br/>\nvisual and aural electronic devices, including, but not limited to<br/>\nvideos, DVDs, video games, CD walkman units, computers, computer games,<br/>\ntelevision and radio. Of equal concern are large-screen movies, whether<br/>\nin the theater or at home. We fully recognize the prevalence of media in<br/>\nour culture and the need that many adults have for this in their<br/>\nvocation and leisure time. We must also recognize, however, that the<br/>\nadult has the ability to absorb and consciously process these<br/>\nexperiences. This a child cannot yet do.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We find that Waldorf Education works best with children who experience<br/>\nlittle or no media at all. We strongly urge the elimination of all media<br/>\nin the kindergarten through fifth grade, and ideally through eighth<br/>\ngrade. The teachers of these grades will provide recommendations about<br/>\nhow to carry this out and develop alternate activities for the children.<br/>\nAs the children get older, it may be increasingly difficult to protect<br/>\nthem completely from media exposure: their experiences become more<br/>\nvaried and the influence of the peer culture strengthens. We will work<br/>\nwith parents to bring some of the forms of media to the older students<br/>\nin a healthy way, to educate them in being knowledgeable, productive,<br/>\nand discerning users of media in our world.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;When children are actively and imaginatively engaged with the natural<br/>\nworld, they experience the joy of their own energy. Their energy soon<br/>\nbecomes will power, self-discipline and ultimately, self-direction. With<br/>\na will, they apply themselves to all artistic endeavors-the music that<br/>\nsoothes the soul, the painting that nourishes it, or the drawing that<br/>\nenlivens it. They apply themselves equally to the precise observation so<br/>\nessential to middle school sciences and mathematics, and the habit of<br/>\nclear thinking in all academics. Children&#39;s thinking also becomes<br/>\nmobile and imaginative: their capacity for living vividly into the<br/>\nstories and biographies they hear becomes the capacity of empathy for<br/>\ntheir fellow humans in adulthood. As adults too, they become<br/>\nindependent, creative individuals, feeling at home in the world. Seen in<br/>\nthis light, it is not so much a matter of avoiding media, as it is one<br/>\nof simply allowing the natural capacities of children to unfold.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Some children are highly sensitive to media influence and cannot leave<br/>\nit at home, but bring it into the classroom in their play. This in turns<br/>\nchanges the nature of the play for many children in the class, rather<br/>\nthan out of their own inner needs they re-enact the disturbing or<br/>\nviolent images they have seen or heard about. Should this become a<br/>\nrecurring problem, the classroom teacher may call for a parent<br/>\nconference.

Ahrimanic powers prepare the evolution of mankind in such a way that it can fall a prey to Ahriman when he appears in human form within Western civilization - hardly then to be called &quot;civilization&quot; in our sense - as once Lucifer appeared in human form in China, as once Christ appeared in human form in Asia Minor.  It is of no avail to give oneself illusions today about these things.  Ahriman will appear in human form and the only question is, how will he find humanity prepared.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a link there but it doesn&#39;t work, but I found this other link (lucky you!)   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.doyletics.com/arj/tadrvw.htm\">http://www.doyletics.com/arj/tadrvw.htm</a>   which will put you on a collision course with wackiness.
