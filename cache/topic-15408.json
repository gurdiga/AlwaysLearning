I am responding to this <br/>\nbecause I accidentally opened it while trying to sort email.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo weeks ago, after another weekend of my DH power washing our street, he <br/>\nasked that I call the city and find out why we never see a street sweeper. Our <br/>\nhouse is a year old. I called and was told that our street had not been <br/>\n&quot;bonded&quot; yet, so I would have to contact the builder and find out when they would <br/>\nsweep the street. So I did. Builder states, &quot;No the street was bonded about a <br/>\nyear ago, the city is responsible, call the city.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I&#39;m getting frustrated. I start to wonder what is included in my $6K a <br/>\nyear property taxes. I was sure I saw public services on the bill. So I call the <br/>\ncity back. I&#39;m put on hold while the representative &quot;checks&quot; the street <br/>\nsweeping maps. She comes back to say, we are not on it, call the builder. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow DH is pissed. He says, &quot;Didn&#39;t you, Kass & Kree work on the mayors <br/>\ncampaign?&quot; Lightbulb moment...&quot;hey, yeah we did...&quot; DH says, email him. So I did. <br/>\nDuring election time the girls and I worked on his campaign, because he is a <br/>\nsupporter of homeschooling (or so he says) and although we have different <br/>\npolitical views, he was kind and my kids had a great time learning about elections. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I went there...email from an HS mom, who&#39;s children worked to have him <br/>\nelected and had been in his home on several occasions, and that being one of the <br/>\nhighest tax brackets for this city, without which all the new crap we are <br/>\ngetting would not be possible, yada, yada, yada. Then I hit the nail on the head <br/>\nwhen I brought up that at the end of our street is the new elementary school. <br/>\nSo for the health and well being of the city&#39;s children, some thing must be <br/>\ndone. (The streets were attracting mosquitoes and algae was building.) And that I <br/>\nno longer felt my DH and my water should be the ones mantaining the streets <br/>\nof our city.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat all started at about 9:30 am. 2:00 pm here comes a street sweeper. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know who sent it, I only know it came. I was happy and sad at the same <br/>\ntime. Glad I was heard, sad I had to bitch to be heard. But the girls learned that <br/>\nwhen you jump through the hoops people throw out, when you get tired of doing <br/>\nso, just go above them.
