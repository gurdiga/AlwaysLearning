In the emails I have read -  &quot;it&#39;s non<br/>\nnegotiable&quot; and &quot;that&#39;s not an option&quot;.   Those types of lay down the law<br/>\nstatements really set others up to feel and act defensively.  It shuts down<br/>\nany hope of finding solutions and having open communications.    <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat works for us is to share how we are feeling, be genuine and not<br/>\ndefensive and be open to hearing the same from others (spouse, children,<br/>\netc.)   I have found when I explain why something is so important to me, my<br/>\nchildren get it and respect it.  I believe that is because they know they<br/>\nwill get the same treatment from me.    I think this goes back to our<br/>\ndiscussion a month ago about choices.  There is *always* a choice, many in<br/>\nfact.   And I choose to be positive and happy and work with in that frame<br/>\nwork to find solutions.   My dds are amazing at finding alternatives that<br/>\nwork for all of us.  They are endlessly creative and very respectful of my<br/>\nneeds and each other&#39;s needs.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSo for me, it&#39;s not about TCS or anything like that, it is just about<br/>\nrespecting each other and trying to live together in harmony.
