She&#39;s not said a word for over <br/>\n  three years since Ben said, &quot;This is OUR decision.&quot; Here is his response! <br/>\n<br/>\n  ~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n  Mom-<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks for breakfast and the conversation on Friday morning. I&#39;d have enjoyed <br/>\n  extending our conversation, but our time was limited.  We can continue at any <br/>\n  time; my schedule is open.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thank you also for asking about the boys&#39; learning and for your concern for <br/>\n  Cameron.  Since our decision to unschool the boys, I think that was the first <br/>\n  time that I felt that someone in my family actually was curious without <br/>\n  interrogating me about why we&#39;d taken the boys out of school.  I certainly <br/>\n  will accept some of the responsibility of not helping where that was <br/>\n  concerned.  To help your curiosity, I&#39;m providing you with some suggested <br/>\n  books, websites, and other resources to have you read.  Taking the time to do <br/>\n  this will answer many of the questions that you have while giving you tons of <br/>\n  other questions which are certain to come up.  While I don&#39;t mind answering <br/>\n  the questions, these resources will help you to understand at least partly <br/>\n  where we&#39;re coming from; you can then ask questions which are more in-depth <br/>\n  and from a point of learning vs questioning the decision and whether or not <br/>\n  it is the right one.  The &quot;why&quot; is less important than the process that we <br/>\n  followed to get to the decision as well as the process of the boys&#39; learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n  One note from our conversation: I truly meant what I said about children and <br/>\n  decisions.  I think that adults spend way too much time trying to tell <br/>\n  children what&#39;s right and wrong vs listening to their children to find out <br/>\n  what&#39;s right for that child.  Children who have the freedom that Cameron and <br/>\n  Duncan have understand this, and, more often than not, make excellent choices <br/>\n  for what is right for them.  While direction is offered, we offer it only <br/>\n  when requested.  Does this mean that Duncan and Cameron don&#39;t understand our <br/>\n  principles and values?  Far from it.  They know that we&#39;ll freely provide <br/>\n  whatever direction that they need; we just don&#39;t believe in imposing our <br/>\n  respective wills, morals, rules, or any other restrictive bias onto them just <br/>\n  because we may have been brought up a certain way or because we&#39;re bigger or <br/>\n  because &quot;we said so&quot;.  In the end, we are also learning as we go with this, <br/>\n  too; the difference is that we know this is the best decision that we have <br/>\n  made to help them with their &quot;education&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Additionally, adults, for the most part, forget what it was like to be 4 or 7 <br/>\n  or 13 or 17.  Those of us who remember do not make it a habit of directing <br/>\n  our children&#39;s destiny or dictating what they should do and when.  Our <br/>\n  children are not drones, told to learn what the State (re: school system) <br/>\n  will have them learn, nor expected to be a success based upon what society or <br/>\n  friends or relatives or we define as a success.  We believe that our children <br/>\n  are free to define when, where, how, and why they learn something; that they <br/>\n  are free to determine their own meaning of what is successful or not.  Most <br/>\n  adults don&#39;t even know what success is.  They just believe what society tells <br/>\n  them, and they go along with that, never living up to the potential of where <br/>\n  their dreams truly lead.  Cameron and Duncan will know how to learn, know the <br/>\n  value of learning, know that there is more than one way to learn, and know <br/>\n  how to use their imagination and dream.  Equally important is that they&#39;ll be <br/>\n  able to determine for themselves what success is and how to truly define it, <br/>\n  and they&#39;ll be able to do this before the age of 18.<br/>\n<br/>\n  One final note along the lines of how we see children:  they are not flowers <br/>\n  waiting to bloom at some special age; they have bloomed already.  We must <br/>\n  treat them with respect for who they are at age 1 or 4 or 10 or whatever age <br/>\n  they are and trust them at those ages as well.  If we wait until they&#39;re 18 <br/>\n  and on their own, we&#39;ll have missed a 17+-year opportunity to provide them <br/>\n  with the most basic guiding principle of being human: treat others as you <br/>\n  would have them treat you.  I&#39;d worry that my kids would resent me more for <br/>\n  not allowing them to learn this (notice that I wrote &quot;learn&quot; and not &quot;teach&quot; <br/>\n  -- there is no such thing as a teacher if someone is not truly willing or <br/>\n  ready to learn) before I&#39;d worry about resentment for not having sent them to <br/>\n  school.  I can live with this because we&#39;ve given them the authority, tools, <br/>\n  resources, and freedom to define their own &quot;education&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I offered those three prior paragraphs as a small insight to me and, to a <br/>\n  large degree, Kelly and how we think.  It is not meant to be seen as right or <br/>\n  wrong or a &quot;that&#39;s the way it is, so f--- you&quot; attitude.  I offer no <br/>\n  apologies and expect no evaluation or criticism of our thought pattern.  I <br/>\n  merely offer it as information and, coupled with the resources below, as an <br/>\n  opportunity for you to understand what we know about unschooling and our <br/>\n  children.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I love you-<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ben<br/>\n<br/>\n  Books about Unschooling:<br/>\n<br/>\n  The man that coined the word &quot;unschooling&quot; was John Holt. The &quot;Father of <br/>\n  Unschooling&quot;, he died in 1985---but he was the instigator of modern home <br/>\n  learning and is still the &quot;authority&quot; on learning. You can find all his books <br/>\n  at the library. He began as a school reformer, but soon realized that schools <br/>\n  were unreformable. His first books are attempts to change the way schools and <br/>\n  teachers teach and respond to children; the later books show how learning <br/>\n  really occurs and that children are naturally curious, creative, and <br/>\n  intelligent---that they are natural learners: &quot;Fish swim, birds fly, humans <br/>\n  learn.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  How Children Fail,  How Children Learn, and Learning All the Time are three <br/>\n  good ones.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Grace Llewellyn wrote The Teenage Liberation Handbook: How to Quit School and <br/>\n  Get a REAL Education. The parable at the beginning alone is worth the price <br/>\n  of the book.<br/>\n<br/>\n  John Taylor Gatto, New York City and New York State Teacher of the Year, who <br/>\n  finally QUIT when he realized that school was not only not helping children, <br/>\n  but seriously harming them.
