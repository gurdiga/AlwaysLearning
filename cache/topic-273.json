Way to go, <br/>\nSandra! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe finally got the Jan/Feb issue off to the printer, and we&#39;re happy <br/>\nwith this one. Still not that full color glossy throughout that we <br/>\nwere hoping to produce by this time, but we&#39;re getting there. I think <br/>\nwe&#39;d have made it if not for my Dad&#39;s medical setbacks this fall - <br/>\nthose weeks and months took a lot away from the business that we&#39;re <br/>\njust now catching up with. Not complaining, mind you - not when I <br/>\nconsider how close we came to losing him this time. Dad&#39;s still <br/>\nparalyzed on his left side (stroke), but Mark and I are heading over <br/>\nto play pinochile with them this evening, for the first time in <br/>\nalmost three months.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got a chuckle out of Sandra&#39;s reply to Laura - and Samantha&#39;s <br/>\nresponse. &lt;g&gt; Interesting how many people fess up to having done <br/>\ndrugs 20-30 years ago...

Something about them <br/>\nsharing a kind of orderliness and predictability... makes sense. I&#39;ve <br/>\nnever been much good at either (orderliness or predictability), <br/>\npreferring to chase wild hairs more often than not, but it&#39;s somehow <br/>\nvaguely reassuring to know that many people do concern themselves <br/>\nwith such things.
