Put <br/>\n&gt; &gt;the phone down. Calling Child Protective will really not help<br/>\n&gt; anything.)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I talk back to the commercials - it really bugs me that kids are getting<br/>\n&gt; bombarded with one-sided, anti-drug messages. If/when these kids actually<br/>\n&gt; try drugs and experience the other side, I think they feel so betrayed by<br/>\n&gt; the system for shoving all the anti-drug propaganda at them for years,<br/>\n&gt; they no longer trust any of it. And it is a balance thing - drugs can<br/>\n&gt; create big problems or exacerbate small problems in some people. They can<br/>\n&gt; also be a lot of fun, and a nice way to mellow out, or alter your<br/>\n&gt; reality, or whatever. I&#39;ve done pretty much everything from heroin on<br/>\n&gt; down, and I did some stupid stuff that I regret (crack houses in South<br/>\n&gt; Phoenix are not pleasant places, and operating or riding in a motor<br/>\n&gt; vehicle while on acid is not a good plan) but I don&#39;t regret experiencing<br/>\n&gt; the drugs themselves. And the stupid commercials never mention that<br/>\n&gt; part...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Someone asked me, along with a long weird list of questions about <br/>\nhomeschooling, what kind of anti-drug program we were doing with Julian. <br/>\n<br/>\nI began laughing hysterically.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince Julian was pretty young, whenever one of those drug or cigarette <br/>\ncommercials went on, we&#39;d look over at Juls and say, &quot;Hey, Jul?&quot; &quot;Yeah,&quot; he&#39;d <br/>\nsay. &quot;Don&#39;t do drugs/smoke.&quot; &quot;&quot;Okay.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was just one of those weird ritualistic things our family got into the <br/>\nhabit of doing (along with our weird bedtime ritual) having little to do with <br/>\ndrugs.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when this person asked this it occurred to me that someday someone may <br/>\noffer Julian drugs or a cigarette, and he may dissolve into hysterical <br/>\nlaughter and say &quot;My mother told me not to.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat it comes down to is that he will have to make the decisions, and however <br/>\nwonderful they are, anti-drug programs DON&#39;T prevent drug use. (They&#39;ve <br/>\nactually documented that the DARE program has no effect whatsoever, but <br/>\nthey&#39;re still funded.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14268,"nextTopicId":14274}}
