We think she is at least 12 and is living out her last years with<br/>\nus.  From what the vets have figured, she was either hit by a car or kicked<br/>\nand her hips were broken, by the time someone left her on the vet office<br/>\ndoorstep, she was about 5 years post injury and everything had fused<br/>\ntogether.  She walks with a horrible limp, can&#39;t groom herself(when she<br/>\ntries she goes into horrific muscle spasms).  We think the reason Faith has<br/>\n(infrequent)accidents is because once she realizes she has to go, it is too<br/>\nlate.  Thankfully she stays in one of 2 places so it isn&#39;t hard to discover<br/>\nproblems.  Peaches and Tigger(both girls) have never sprayed(that I have<br/>\nseen - in the almost 2 years we have had them) and they use the box<br/>\nfrequently.  We have Bailey the mutt and Amber the epileptic retriever and<br/>\nthey potty outside.   Aside from scooping outdoor doggy doo and changing the<br/>\nlitter box twice a week, pet potty is not a problem.  Also, the cats and<br/>\ndogs get along so well.  We often find the dogs and Peaches and Tigger all<br/>\nsnuggled up with each other.  Faith likes to be left alone, and everyone<br/>\nrespects her decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Joe and I were first married he got me a cat who hated my guts and<br/>\nwould pee on me when I was sleeping, on my clothes if they were on the floor<br/>\nor wherever I was sitting.  Needless to say she found new parents after 3<br/>\nmonths.<br/>\n<br/>\nsistakammi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Susan Bundlie&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:strandbe@...\">strandbe@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, January 08, 2002 10:00 PM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Territorial pussycats<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;We love to have company, but allergy folks be prepared;  we have 3 cats,<br/>\n2<br/>\n&gt; dogs (all rescuees).&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With that many animals, do you have a (feline) pee problem?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Susan (who obviously has!) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77859720,"authorName":"Susan Bundlie","from":"Susan Bundlie &lt;strandbe@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Territorial pussycats","postDate":"1010545226","msgId":2330,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI4NjEwRTZBLjZCOCVzdHJhbmRiZUBtZWRpYW9uZS5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMTA1NDQ4MjkuMjgyMS42MzgyMS5tNUB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":2332,"prevInTime":2329,"nextInTime":2331,"topicId":2330,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" With that many animals, do you have a (feline) pee problem?","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1778858056\">&lt;&lt;We love to have company, but allergy folks be prepared;  we have 3 cats, 2<br/>\ndogs (all rescuees).&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWith that many animals, do you have a (feline) pee problem?<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan (who obviously has!)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2522,"nextTopicId":2529}}
