Two outings a week are usually more than enough, although there have been longer periods where Noor has enjoyed either staying home or going out more frequently. She&#39;s almost always game for a walk around the neighborhood every day regardless.  The walks have always been a, &quot;Lets go for a walk&quot; invitation rather than a question like,&quot;Do you want to go for a walk?&quot;. It is very rare for her to not want to go, although sometimes she&#39;ll suggest a later time, which is fine with me. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think sometimes parents of younger children pose too many things as questions that can have &quot;No&quot; for an answer.

My oldest and youngest dd&#39;s love getting out (14 and 8 respectively), but the middle one (11) loves to just keep working on her projects at home...I understand she is reluctant to give up time on something she is loving, but we are not living in an area where it is safe to leave her alone. The others get really tense if we don&#39;t get out every few days, and she is tense if we DO. I usually try to find some middle ground- giving her time to prepare to leave her activity, not demanding it but trying to explain it is hard for us to stay home this much. She usually ends up enjoying the time out once we get there- but I feel guilty about even asking her to put away what she has been doing in order to get out with us. Is this &#39;unschooly&#39; in that we are putting some needs ahead of hers at those times, and if so are there any suggestions for how to manage everyone&#39;s needs better?

I would welcome any suggestions and otherwise we are loving unschooling (we have been reading, trying, watching for about 8 months!)

A couple weeks? A month? Longer? A month seems long to me, but not a couple weeks. Mo goes through phases of not wanting to get out much - she&#39;s a strong introvert and if there have been people coming to our house she&#39;s not terribly interested in going other places.

If you&#39;re expecting them to be easy, then every rough transition is going to seem like a failure and you&#39;ll be tense and she&#39;ll feel that tension and that will make everything harder? What&#39;s she doing? Screaming and kicking? Pick her up gently and apologetically and commiserate that transitions are hard. It can help to have everything ready before then - car packed and started and all you need to do is get her in.

Right about<br/>\nthat time, she got sick and we stayed home for a whole week (maybe a<br/>\nbit more) and it seems as if she found out that she really liked it<br/>\n(up until then, we would go out often, to the groceries, to the park,<br/>\nto meet other moms and their little kids, etc.). At least, I think<br/>\nboth things are connected...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, we got a Wii for Christmas and she&#39;s been having a great time<br/>\nwith it. She loves to play! Needless to say, we really don&#39;t go out as<br/>\nmuch, but we do have a great time at home. We play with the Wii, we<br/>\nwatch videos on youtube, she paints drawings online, she writes<br/>\nletters (at her request) of different sizes and colours on a word<br/>\ndocument, sometimes we cook, she takes a bath and plays with her toys<br/>\nevery other day, we run around the house, jump on the bed, etc. --the<br/>\nlist is long but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the point here, so I won&#39;t go<br/>\non.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, she&#39;s never really been a people person, but I know she loves<br/>\nbeing with her grandmother and grandfather and my aunt, for instance.<br/>\nBut even then, just as we&#39;re about to leave to meet them, she doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwant to anymore. I usually tell her, in a few words, that people are<br/>\nalready expecting us (if it&#39;s too late to call it off) and she seems<br/>\nto understand and comes along. Then, when she&#39;s there, she loves being<br/>\nthere and has a good time. She usually only asks to go back home if<br/>\nwe&#39;re at a place she doesn&#39;t know, with people she doesn&#39;t know (but<br/>\nafter asking once or twice, and being there for a while, she&#39;s fine),<br/>\nor if she&#39;s really upset or tired or both.<br/>\n<br/>\nI try to suggest things for us to do outside, things I know she enjoys<br/>\n(eat ice creams. buy toys, go to the park), but, in the end, when<br/>\nwe&#39;re all ready to go, she says she wants to stay home instead, which<br/>\nis fine by me. Sometimes, I wonder if it&#39;s the transitioning part<br/>\nthat&#39;s hard on her --if so, any ideas on how to help her? I don&#39;t mind<br/>\nstaying at home with her, and my husband and I usually go to the<br/>\ngroceries or do other things we need to do on his days off (one of us<br/>\nstays at home with her, if she doesn&#39;t want to go out). When I need to<br/>\nsee people, I&#39;m the one that goes to the groceries (and so my husband<br/>\ncan also relax a bit at home) and my needs get met. I know that in a<br/>\nfew years, I&#39;ll be able to go out as much as I want and I&#39;ll probably<br/>\nmiss these times when she was little...<br/>\n<br/>\nShe got sick again, twice this year (runny nose, a bit feverish) and<br/>\nmy husband has been telling me that he&#39;s concerned that her immune<br/>\nsystem is too fragile and that maybe we should go out more (she got<br/>\nsick the day after we went out, on both occasions). Even though I&#39;m<br/>\nnot sure that what he&#39;s saying is completely accurate (can anyone<br/>\npoint me to any research about a link between being out and not<br/>\ngetting sick, please?), I don&#39;t want to overlook his concerns and I<br/>\nwant to reassure him that I&#39;ll do my best to help Constança be healthy<br/>\nand not get sick, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m afraid I&#39;m not suggesting as much as I could, or helping her<br/>\ntransition... Just looking back at what I wrote, I can see fear in my<br/>\nthoughts. I&#39;m afraid we should be getting out more, partly because of<br/>\nmy husband&#39;s concerns, which I respect, but also because of my parents<br/>\nand aunt, who are constantly asking me if we&#39;re going out (they call<br/>\nus on skype on a daily basis, I don&#39;t answer them everytime they call)<br/>\nand telling me that I should take her out more. I also remember, when<br/>\nfirst reading about the way primitive societies raised their kids<br/>\n(right after Constança was born) and how we should try to apply those<br/>\npractices to our lives, that there was a strong emphasis on everything<br/>\nnature-related --even though I now see those readings as less valuable<br/>\nto me, for my path towards being a better mom and person and radically<br/>\nunschooling my child the best I can, it feels as if those thoughts are<br/>\nstill in the back of my head...<br/>\n<br/>\nShe seems to be happy with our current arrangement, maybe I should<br/>\nvalue that instead of what people around me say...
