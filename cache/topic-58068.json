One of the theories about the ice age is that only 1/3 of the earth, the northern hemisphere, was covered.  There are other theories.  I started drawing pie charts to show her and reflected that I wouldn&#39;t have done that if she&#39;d asked the question a year ago, maybe not even six months ago.  She is really into pie charts right now, though.  She&#39;s seeing things in fractions, in slices of pizza pie.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHer initial question was: &quot;How much of the earth was covered by the ice age?  Was there any place dinosaurs may have found to hide (Dinotopia-style)?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are so many pieces to that question! My role is to offer the information, listen/look for what she attaches to, and filter (don&#39;t like that word choice, but can&#39;t think of a better one) the rest from there and from what I know about her *right now.* <br/>\n<br/>\nSix months ago, the question was more about what the ice age looked like.  How did it happen?  I had to look for ways to help her imagine the sun being blocked out, for years on end.  Now she wants cartography, numbers, geology.  Then she was open to images, repeated viewings of the sixth episode of &quot;Walking with the Dinosaurs,&quot; a towel-covered jar that was left over a house plant for a few weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s more, in terms of the Thanksgiving question...<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, it is also a matter of protection--that too much information can be overwhelming and cause shut-down.  And that a lot about our world is scary.  I have the power, while my daughter is still really young, to show her that the world is a messed up place or that people are generally good, although bad things happen.  You never know how a child&#39;s mind will spin information, what fears/anxieties they&#39;ll take away from something innocuous.  By showing them the loving, positive, bright-side of things when they&#39;re really young, you give them strength to feel powerful over facing (maybe even changing) the darker side of life/history. At least, this is what I believe.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome may shriek, &quot;Censorship&quot;!  I know that.....my husband used to.  He feels that he grew-up undereducated and unaware.  I grew up in a home that was very different; as a Jewish family, the &quot;never forget&quot; sentiment ran strong.  By close to my dd&#39;s age, I&#39;d already read Anne Frank&#39;s diary, Chaim Potok, Eli Wiesel.  When our library got a new librarian who spoke with a heavy German accent, I was terrified of her.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt seven, Noor knows some things about the holocaust and about the genocide of American Indians.  But I wouldn&#39;t have shared these things with her when she was 4.5.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I extend Sandra&#39;s metaphor of unschooling as horticulture, I see my act of filtering information as though I&#39;m protecting a new seedling from the weather, until her roots and stalk are strong enough to withstand the winds and rain and snow.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Historically Accurate Books About Thanksgiving for Young Kids?","postDate":"1289750773","msgId":58098,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM0N0YxNkI2LTUyNTEtNDk4Ri05NTJGLTYxQUVFMUVDODRBNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlib3ZmOStlaTYwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlib3ZmOStlaTYwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58097,"nextInTopic":58099,"prevInTime":58097,"nextInTime":58099,"topicId":58068,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-New facts will be discovered. -=- I think I would like to withdraw facts and replace it with evidence and reports. ...

For me, it also speaks to the joy of unschooling because there is the recognition that learning happens ALL the time--there&#39;s no need to list every detail *you* know in one sitting when you believe that your children will have the time/space to come to it when they&#39;re open and ready for the information. AND, there is no need to try and get history to sit still while you package it into a curriculum or learning objective!<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember a college class I took called &quot;Women in Ancient History.&quot;  We read Sarah Pomeroy&#39;s book &quot;Goddesses, Wives, Whores and Slaves: Women in Classical Antiquity&quot; (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Goddesses-Whores-Wives-Slaves-Classical/dp/080521030X/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top)\">http://www.amazon.com/Goddesses-Whores-Wives-Slaves-Classical/dp/080521030X/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top)</a>.  I was continually furious throughout the class. We encountered information I&#39;d never learned in my other Ancient History classes and I&#39;d feel a sense of betrayal, that I&#39;d been duped by not being exposed to the &quot;whole truth.&quot;  Probably because there wasn&#39;t enough time, more so than due to malice or a desire to marginalize women.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I was 20 years old and a product of years of schooling.  Even at 7, my daughter has a better sense of agency over her learning than I did as a college junior. Unlike me, at 20, learning isn&#39;t something done to her--where she has to wait for mealtime to be fed-- it is something she does naturally; she feeds herself and her hunger is strong! Her world is so big that it is difficult to imagine her Not asking: &quot;what about the women?&quot; or &quot;what did the Lenape do when the Europeans came?&quot; and then my role as reference librarian kicks in.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on that note, I&#39;m off to try and find out if there is a chance any part of the Earth was left untouched by the Ice Age.....<br/>\n<br/>\nBrie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":233098946,"authorName":"Lisa E Biesemeyer","from":"Lisa E Biesemeyer &lt;l.biesemeyer@...&gt;","profile":"l.biesemeyer@sbcglobal.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Historically Accurate Books About Thanksgiving for Young Kids?","postDate":"1289703706","msgId":58093,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ3ODg1NS4zNTI1NC5xbUB3ZWI4MzUwNi5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDE5MDA1NzlBLTFDNEMtNDkxRi05RERELTFBNzlGRjhGMDJEQ0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGlibmRpbitudWYzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MTkwMDU3OUEtMUM0Qy00OTFGLTlEREQtMUE3OUZGOEYwMkRDQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58092,"nextInTopic":58097,"prevInTime":58092,"nextInTime":58094,"topicId":58068,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"While at the library today, I came across a Scholastic/Weston Woods dvd called Stories of Thanksgiving that features two stories: Giving Thanks:A Native ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-442583246\">While at the library today, I came across a Scholastic/Weston Woods dvd called <br/>\n&quot;Stories of Thanksgiving&quot; that features two stories: &quot;Giving Thanks:A Native <br/>\nAmerican Good Morning Message&quot; (narrated in English and Mowhawk by Chief Jake <br/>\nSwamp) and &quot;The Pilgrims of Plimoth&quot;.
