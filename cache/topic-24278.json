There&#39;s something in between &quot;making&quot; kids go to bed at a time that&#39;s convenient for you and the whole family pulling your collective hair out because no-one&#39;s getting enough sleep. If the kids will go to bed when you do - even mostly - then make a nice, getting-ready-for-bed routine at least for yourself. Let going to bed be something warm and comfortable rather than something to fight and stress about. There&#39;s nothing whatsoever wrong with having a regular schedule! I work out of the home and have a &quot;bedtime&quot; of my own, and most nights my 9yo comes and snuggles with me for awhile before I fall asleep. Then she either goes to her own bed or gets up and does something else. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour kids are younger and will need more help if they&#39;re up, but if just one of them is up (other than the 1yo) how much help does that child need? Can you set up snacks and a movie and settle down with the rest? <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":468213406,"authorName":"Panda baby","from":"&quot;Panda baby&quot; &lt;annie@...&gt;","profile":"annie.powter","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Sleeping","postDate":"1289222376","msgId":58028,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGliOHRkOCtiaGRsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":24302,"nextInTopic":58031,"prevInTime":58027,"nextInTime":58029,"topicId":24278,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I haven t posted before, but have been reading on this group for about 5 months.  I started homeschooling with my daughter at the start of our school year in","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-331809903\">I haven&#39;t posted before, but have been reading on this group for about 5 months.  I started homeschooling with my daughter at the start of our school year in February.  After a couple of months started moving towards unschooling without knowing yet there was a name.  Found Sandra&#39;s sites and some unschooling books and was emboldened to continue.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I come from a very strict upbringing parenting-wise.  So it&#39;s the other half of the unschooling lifestyle that has been very different to anything we know or have seen in others around us.  For the last couple of months we have started to challenge our own ideas with regard to the big 3 - eating, tv, sleeping.  And we have been reading, thinking, talking, changing, watching and waiting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI need some advice or perhaps encouragement (but in a helpful informative way, not just pat on the back you&#39;re doing great way).  I am wrecked.  We have 4 children - 1.5 yrs (R), 3.5 yrs (E), 5 yrs (W) and 6.5 yrs (H).  When we decided to stop enforcing bed time at a particular time, things were going well for a while.  Before then, R, E, and W would go to bed at 7 -7.30 and H would stay up til 8.30-9 ish.  R still goes off to bed sleepy at around 7.30-8 (we went into daylight savings too).  W was the only one to say he was tired and could we take him up to bed on some nights (he likes to sleep in his own bed).  H will stay up until the last parent goes to bed because she enjoys that atmosphere I think, and though she wants to stay up later she doesn&#39;t want to be up alone (She doesn&#39;t want to stay up with just W and E, but I&#39;m sure this will change as she gets older).  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut E is this incredible night owl.  One night it was 2.30am before I was able to gently convince her to come lie down in bed with me for a bit when she finally went to sleep.  She probably could have happily stayed awake longer (she wanted to watch another movie) - but I couldn&#39;t. <br/>\n<br/>\nI understand we have done awful damage that we have to undo now and that we are still deschooling.  And we are still gaining their trust that this process of listening to your own body and recognising when you are tired will continue forever, but in the meantime they are kind of gorging on late nights.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the beginning I tried to stay up as late as I could every night so they could experience feeling tired and have experience choosing to go to sleep.  But it doesn&#39;t really seem to be working out that way. H, W, and E are still eager to be up when I want to go to bed somewhere between 10 and 11 - and it just kind of seems that they go to bed when we do rather than finding their own sleepy time. At times gently talking about how tired they look if it&#39;s obvious (tired eyes, yawning, etc) and then the next day maybe if they got cranky trying to piece it together doesn&#39;t make any difference.  And if there is something on in the morning to get to so everyone doesn&#39;t have the time to sleep in until they wake up naturally - it makes getting there on time hard when night owls want to be still sleeping.  And I am up from when the little one R wakes up, usually before everyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we have come so far along this road and have changed so much, but some of the benefits seem so far off when I am tired.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this all to be expected?  Will this only take a few more weeks before the kids relax into it more?  Are we going about this all wrong?</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":116488337,"authorName":"Gold Standard","from":"&quot;Gold Standard&quot; &lt;jacki@...&gt;","profile":"jackiknouse","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Sleeping","postDate":"1139093420","msgId":24302,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHRUVIS0JEQUIuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDY5QzRCQUI1LUExRjgtNDE5Ri1BRjFGLTA3NkE2NEFCMTZBRUBzYmNnbG9iYWwubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":24296,"nextInTopic":58028,"prevInTime":24301,"nextInTime":24303,"topicId":24278,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks Paula.

He has grown 8","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1090674973\">Hi all,<br/>\n <br/>\nMy 12 year old son, Riley, began to pull away from hugs within the last<br/>\nyear at the exact same time that he was going through puberty.  He has<br/>\ngrown 8 inches in one year and has literally changed before my eyes.<br/>\nBefore this change he liked to hug and be hugged but never as much as my<br/>\ntwo younger children.  My 10 year old son, Casey, loves to cuddle and so<br/>\ndoes my 5 year old daughter, Maggie.  I think that it is partly a<br/>\npersonality difference with my kids but it is hard to be sure.  Riley is<br/>\nmy oldest and we were not living an unschooled life for the first 8<br/>\nyears of his life.  Unfortunately, he was in school and had to live with<br/>\nrules.  My two younger children have had the advantage of living a much<br/>\nmore free life and it really does show at times.    <br/>\n <br/>\nHowever, I have noticed an interesting change in Riley lately.  He has<br/>\nhis first girlfriend.  He is very affectionate and cuddly with her and<br/>\nit seems to have made him a little more open to hugs from me.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAlso, Riley just experienced his first kiss and he shared that<br/>\ninformation with both my husband and me.  I thought that it was<br/>\nabsolutely wonderful that he could share something so private and life<br/>\nchanging with us.  I never told my mom and dad about my first kiss.  He<br/>\nalso told me jokingly that he only saw half of the movie the other night<br/>\nwhen he went out with some friends to see a movie.  At first I was a<br/>\nlittle confused and then I quickly realized what he was telling me.  He<br/>\nand his girlfriend were busy &quot;making out&quot;.  Again, he shared something<br/>\nwith me that I would have never told my parents and I am sure that most<br/>\nkids don&#39;t share with their parents.  I am very grateful that he can be<br/>\nso open with us.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThis open communication helps lessen my worries.  Yes, I have to admit<br/>\nthat I am a little worried.  Riley&#39;s girlfriend is 14 and is very<br/>\nserious about Riley.  I realize that it is not about age, it is more<br/>\nabout maturity, but every once in a while I become conflicted.  I think<br/>\nI am still accepting how much he has changed in the last year.  I am<br/>\nalso worried about how serious the relationship seems.  I guess I<br/>\nexpected all of this to happen a little later in life.  Has anyone had<br/>\nany similar experiences?  I would really like to hear some of your<br/>\nthoughts on this.<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks<br/>\nDeanne  <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSPONSORED LINKS <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Unschooling&w1=Unschooling&w2=Attac\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Unschooling&w1=Unschooling&w2=Attac</a><br/>\nhment+parenting&w3=John+holt&w4=Parenting+magazine&w5=Single+parenting&c<br/>\n=5&s=104&.sig=O82AQhD_DXKdsA55u0IORA&gt;  <br/>\nAttachment<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Attachment+parenting&w1=Unschooling\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Attachment+parenting&w1=Unschooling</a><br/>\n&w2=Attachment+parenting&w3=John+holt&w4=Parenting+magazine&w5=Single+pa<br/>\nrenting&c=5&s=104&.sig=mWlG37faHBsTH26WLfJbUw&gt;  parenting <br/>\nJohn<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=John+holt&w1=Unschooling&w2=Attachm\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=John+holt&w1=Unschooling&w2=Attachm</a><br/>\nent+parenting&w3=John+holt&w4=Parenting+magazine&w5=Single+parenting&c=5<br/>\n&s=104&.sig=aXLviSaeQBQ0Koa1fFBC0w&gt;  holt <br/>\n<br/>\nParenting<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Parenting+magazine&w1=Unschooling&w\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Parenting+magazine&w1=Unschooling&w</a><br/>\n2=Attachment+parenting&w3=John+holt&w4=Parenting+magazine&w5=Single+pare<br/>\nnting&c=5&s=104&.sig=1vVhu6yG9zKP6tD21Ys9qw&gt;  magazine <br/>\nSingle<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Single+parenting&w1=Unschooling&w2=\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Single+parenting&w1=Unschooling&w2=</a><br/>\nAttachment+parenting&w3=John+holt&w4=Parenting+magazine&w5=Single+parent<br/>\ning&c=5&s=104&.sig=86a8STGJlXAgNag9XEqGWA&gt;  parenting <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!

I thought I would just share our families arrangements, not that<br/>\nthey are working so wonderfully or anything. My dh couldn&#39;t stand sleeping<br/>\nin the same room as the kids, they were too noisy for him to sleep and so at<br/>\nabout 6 weeks old me and the twins got booted out of the room into the<br/>\nlivingroom/couch. I did not like that one bit but it made sense at the time,<br/>\nso I can sort of relate to husbands that have been booted out of their<br/>\nbedrooms. When we moved when the kids were 7 months old we set up 2<br/>\nbedrooms, 1 for me and the twins and 1 for my dh. He has tried to move into<br/>\nour room several times over the past 2 years but just cannot sleep thru the<br/>\nkids noises. Now, I find this hilarious b/c my dh is the LOUDEST snorer in<br/>\nthe known universe and I had slept thru his snoring for 5 years before the<br/>\nbirth of our children. Now he has a cpap machine and I simply cannot sleep<br/>\nthru the sound of that machine. Go figure. I miss being able to just snuggle<br/>\nwith him in our bed. Other than that, our sleeping arrangements have worked<br/>\nout fine up until now. My son was starting to move around so badly and sleep<br/>\nliterally on top of my head and so I have started to transition him into a<br/>\ntoddler bed smack up against the side of our king size bed and he usually<br/>\nsleeps thru the night in his little toddler bed. But, my dd is still very<br/>\nvery needy to sleep in the big bed with mommy and there would be no way I<br/>\ncould just kick her out. We have all had a bit of a stomach bug for the past<br/>\nweek and I guess my son didn&#39;t feel well in the middle of the night. I was<br/>\nworking in my office across the hall and he got out of bed to go looking for<br/>\nme and ended up stopping and falling asleep in our dog&#39;s bed at the foot of<br/>\nour big bed in the bedroom, which is also smack up against the kingsize<br/>\nfamily bed. When I went in to go to sleep and saw my baby boy sleeping 1/2<br/>\non the floor/1/2 on the dog&#39;s bed my heart just died a thousand deaths. OMG,<br/>\nI thought, I have kicked the poor child out of our bed and he needs a warm<br/>\nbody so badly that he went to sleep with the dog!! Now, we love our Penelope<br/>\n(our boxer) and she is definitely my first child, but, there is no way I<br/>\nwould make my kid sleep with the dog instead of in our big bed. So, I<br/>\nscooped up the child and held him all night long in our big bed like old<br/>\ntimes and it is just so sweet to breathe in the breath of a sleeping child.<br/>\nI cannot figure out for the life of me why so many husbands don&#39;t realize<br/>\nhow precious this time is. Soon enough they will be, like, don&#39;t kiss me<br/>\nmom, drop me off at the corner so no one sees me get out of the car mom,<br/>\nstuff like that. Now they want me to hold them and kiss them and snuggle all<br/>\nnight long and it is just so precious. Yeah, except when he kicks and rolls<br/>\nover his sister trying to land the coveted spot right on top of my head.<br/>\nWhat *is* it with him? I think he&#39;s practicing for world wrestling<br/>\nchampionships. His father was pretty good supposedly back in college. :-) We<br/>\nfigure at some point in the distant future we will have our marital bed back<br/>\nin the masterbedroom and the kids in their own rooms or on our floor but for<br/>\nnow I go visit dh in his room. -Arlynn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57990,"nextTopicId":58030}}
