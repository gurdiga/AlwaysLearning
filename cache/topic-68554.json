We have lent him money and given him things he has needed or wanted. At the moment his car is in for repairs so he is sharing cars with us. We happily share with him. It was simply that he was forgetting to ask, not telling us where he was or when he would be back, and when my husband would go outside to drive to work, the car would not be there. This was obviously a problem. My husband had asked him to check before taking the car but he wasn&#39;t doing it. This was the sort of issue we needed to talk with him about, because he does similar things with other issues, such as wearing his younger brothers clothes because he wants to, but without asking (clothes his brother has bought for himself). Once he even wore his brother&#39;s work clothes without checking, and his brother got in trouble at work for not wearing the right clothes (they&#39;re just cool black jeans and shirt - he&#39;s a barista). So this was an issue that was affecting other people in the family. For some reason, our son is taking longer than some other people to learn about respecting other people and their property. I understand that we all learn at different rates, and I speak with him calmly about it from time to time, pointing out the impact of his choices on other people.<br/>\n<br/>\n--I would tell my son to let me know when he needed the car as not only a polite but mindful thing to do.--<br/>\n <br/>\nYes, that&#39;s what we&#39;ve done.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Could you set up a shelf in the refrigerator for each person so people know if a special food is being saved by someone?--<br/>\n<br/>\nYep, done that too! We bought a second fridge, so that food designated for cooking is kept separate from food that is available for anyone to eat, so that everyone knew what they could eat without checking. He also has a bar fridge in his room that he shares with his brother (it was bought by his brother). And yet there are still times when he takes food that he knows belongs to someone else. As I said, he is still learning to show respect for other people and their property. I love him regardless, but I also feel sad for those whose toes are trodden on, and home needs to be a place where their needs are respected too. He is still learning to do that, and it upsets his siblings. They are learning ways of dealing with this, such as being honest about how they feel, and asking him to please ask rather than just take. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":345817076,"authorName":"Sylvia Woodman","from":"Sylvia Woodman &lt;sylvia057@...&gt;","profile":"sylviawoodman","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Older teens paying board?","postDate":"1344798056","msgId":68581,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBTUhKS0xfb282Q0xIZlF1Nys0X2kzMG9lLVU0R0J0M3VkMFNkSGtqNzMySFB3c3dEd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGswNzI5MCtoOW1kQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGswNzI5MCtoOW1kQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68580,"nextInTopic":68588,"prevInTime":68580,"nextInTime":68582,"topicId":68554,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I realize that I m not the person you are asking as my kids are still both under ten but I wanted to share how my family has dealt with this issue.

You have voiced so eloquently most of what was in my head. You articulated what was up until a few hours ago mostly just random swirling thoughts in my head. The tone and consistency of all the replies is in keeping with the way I have been viewing this situation and I was fortunately able to have some hard discussions with my husband this afternoon. I basically shared with him (again) my thoughts that were much along the lines of what you all have written. I knew that he had some deeper issues going on, and that his idea of our son &quot;paying board&quot; was a surface solution and not really going to address what really mattered. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband was eventually able to see that what he was really feeling was a sense of being busy and overwhelmed, and he was feeling frustrated when our son would do things like borrow the car without asking, or take food without checking if it was set aside for other people, or leave his wet washing in a basket for four days and then complain that a shirt went mouldy.... These were my husband&#39;s complaints, as were my words in my original post (about him &quot;breezing in and out&quot; etc). My husband is still moving towards a place of fully embracing radical unschooling; hence his difficulty with these issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was good today to be able to clarify the underlying issues, and I was able to talk to him about my desire for our home to be a warm and welcome place for all of our children, regardless of their age or work status.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, when my son mentioned the &quot;board&quot; idea (which my husband had already talked to him about, unbeknownst to me), he referred to it as &quot;paying to be part of the family&quot;. I am so glad that my husband was able to see that it wasn&#39;t really board that he was wanting, but more communication (about things like car borrowing etc) and more contribution and connection.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all for your time in replying.

Unless they&#39;re the enemy or you want to run them off, I woudln&#39;t charge them rent or any such thing.

We&#39;re letting them take their time to move out, because 18 and 21 are arbitrary legalities, and there&#39;s nothing biological about either age.  <br/>\n<br/>\nToo many kids are booted out into the world early.  There aren&#39;t enough jobs and houses for everyone, and there&#39;s no advantage to parents to having an emptier house.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving a working child home is WAY less expensive than having one living in a dorm at a university.  I can&#39;t see why charging an 18 year old to live in his own home is helpful to anyone at all.  It&#39;s more likely to drive a wedge of resentment both ways than it is to promote love and learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":494153974,"authorName":"freerangemum","from":"&quot;freerangemum&quot; &lt;freerangemum@...&gt;","profile":"freerangemum","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Older teens paying board?","postDate":"1344736352","msgId":68554,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGswNzI5MCtoOW1kQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":68555,"prevInTime":68553,"nextInTime":68555,"topicId":68554,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"To people who have or are parenting teens, what are your thoughts about charging board once they re working full time?
