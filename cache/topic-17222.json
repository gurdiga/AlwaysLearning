Retta<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;I always carry homeopathic Arnica Montana 30C with me to the ice <br/>\narena, and a bottle of Arnica spray, as well as Arnica gel for <br/>\ntopical application.  We apply the spray if the injury is too sore to <br/>\ntouch, and the gel if we can touch it, and she takes the Arnica 30C <br/>\ninternally, as often as one pellet every 15 minutes when the pain is <br/>\nsevere.  And we ice the injury with a bag of crushed ice.  As the <br/>\npain lessens we take the Arnica 30C pellets less and less frequently <br/>\nuntil she doesn&#39;t need them, or needs them only a couple of times a <br/>\nday as the healing progresses.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor sprains and strains we additionally use Ruta Graveolens 30C.  And <br/>\nfor injuries to areas rich in nerves, like finger, toes, elbows or <br/>\ntailbones, we use Hypericum 30C and Hypericum spray. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
