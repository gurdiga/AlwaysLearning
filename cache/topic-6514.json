If his beliefs were promoting an anti-gay or anti Iranian or anti<br/>\nnorthern European, rather than the generalized anybody-but-white, I might<br/>\nhave a different reaction.  I have very close friends that gay or Iranian or<br/>\nfrom northern Europe.  I know my son and I have daily interaction with<br/>\npeople who are homophobic.  But they don&#39;t promote these ideas publicly.  If<br/>\nthey do, and I have any kind of control of the situation, I will take them<br/>\nto task.

So is this a cop out?<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra, at these meetings the room is full of teachers, this guy is just one<br/>\nof them.  I do find myself going to the others if there&#39;s an option.
