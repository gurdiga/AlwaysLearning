A woman in my town used to leave her sons in the care of a family who lived on a farm. It seemed like a wholesome and idyllic arrangement until a tractor tire fell over on her 3 year old son on the farm one day. His little spine was crushed, and he died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. The mother of the toddler was shattered with grief and could never accept that the caregivers had not &quot;killed&quot; her son, even though they had not foreseen that the huge tire would fall and kill the boy, and even though they themselves were also clearly shattered by grief. Her bitterness and blaming did not bring her little boy back to life, of course. But they did make her toxic to herself and everyone around her. So..., be grateful that your little son is healthy and alive. Like the chick, he is very little and fragile. Cherish every day that the universe has given you to spend with your son. Believe that your son is as innocent as that chick (and chicks in pens do step on each other and break each other&#39;s necks all the time). And, although it is a platitude, remember that accidents do happen. If an adult had accidentally killed the chick (e.g., by tripping and falling when holding it), would you be able to forgive? Or would you choose to amplify everyone&#39;s suffering by blaming? Sometimes we blame others as adults because we were unfairly blamed or shamed as children. You can&#39;t change what has happened in the past, but you can reframe the situation and change your response now.

You don&#39;t need to hold a specific philosophy to find the death of a pet disturbing.  Or to consider it somewhat more alarming than a broken dish or a stained carpet.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not about making the mom feel good.  The responsibility for the whole situation,  the death of one pet, mistreatment of another, mishandling of the situation and the mistreatment of the child, is entirely on the mother and father.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe situation as the mother described was questioning, stern talking, and too rough handling of the child and placing him in time out.   None of that is good.   An adult who mistreats a child is committing a worse offense than a child who has no understanding and mistreats an animal.  Adults have the capacity to know better and a responsibility to do better.    Did the child feel the mother valued the chick or kitten more in those moments than she did him?   I can&#39;t know.  But a child who can&#39;t yet understand about the careful treatment of other living things was probably not considering his mother&#39;s long term affection.   He probably had no idea why she was going on about the chick, nor did he understand why he was being handled roughly and placed in time out.   He was probably confused and distressed but not scarred from these two experiences as described by the mother.     <br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is a pattern in the home that doesn&#39;t change, of the mom mistreating the child over pet issues, then that&#39;s a problem that could eventually result in a child feeling the mother values the pets above her child.     That doesn&#39;t seem to be the case here according to the poster.   Lots of people find ways to live with animals in their home without their children feeling the pets are more important.  People find ways to have multiple children and help them all feel loved.   There are ways to handle situations where a child is tormenting a sibling or repeatedly bothering a grandparent or sick person.    None of those situations should be trivialized out of fear of making the child feel less loved.   They can be resolved in thoughtful ways.  It is not necessary to treat animals (or anyone else) with less consideration in order to bolster our children&#39;s sense of love.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThis mom knew her little boy couldn&#39;t be gentle with animals and yet brought animals into the home and gave him opportunity to be alone with them.    She should have avoided bringing the animals into the home for now.    But there they are.    So another approach is to keep the animals safe from a child who isn&#39;t ready to be handling them.  How someone does that will depend on their situation, the size and layout of their home, their property, and on their resources and creativity.    Don&#39;t set the child up to fail by allowing him access to the pets.   He&#39;ll get older and they&#39;ll get bigger and the situation will change.     And the next thing is to find better ways to handle supervised child/pet interactions and deal with problems.  Talk to the child about what the pet likes or doesn&#39;t like.  Talk (but don&#39;t lecture) about what can hurt or frighten the pet.  If the child isn&#39;t gentle rescue the party at risk of injury.   Remove the child from the situation.   Not in a rough or punishing way.   Don&#39;t lecture or berate him.    If he cannot understand that rough handling causes pain and fear and distress to others he&#39;s not going to understand your scolding or punishment.   Engage the child so he is happily away from the pets.     Wait a good while before the next supervised child and pet interaction.    <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] re: mistreatment of pets","postDate":"1300719305","msgId":60329,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA0OERGNENGLTlCM0QtNDQzMi1CQTk1LTA0M0FGMUU1MTE3MkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDgyNTMxNS41MDk4NC5xbUB3ZWIxMTE0MTAubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDgyNTMxNS41MDk4NC5xbUB3ZWIxMTE0MTAubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":60324,"nextInTopic":60334,"prevInTime":60328,"nextInTime":60330,"topicId":60324,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- We do all love the chicks and the kitty and we were all sad.

Was it a $15 chick specially bred? <br/>\nOne session with a psychologist costs more than the most expensive chick, I think. &quot;-So this is why I explained that it was sad to us all so bad in that sense, I wasn&#39;t clear by what you wrote here what you were asking was so bad?  Then you mentioned a psychologist so that is why I wondered if that was the advice you were giving there.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t understand at all from re reading the posts how you could construe what I said as not valuing my sons life or comparing it to a chicks.  I was doing no such thing.  My email was just in concern for what I could do to help.  Admittedly I was feeling like maybe there was something more to it as my other 2 children did not mistreat animals so this is new to me.  All i was trying to answer was that it was bad and sad that the chick died.  I thought that was what you were asking me.  The wording of your above quote just wasn&#39;t clear.  Sorry for all the confusion.<br/>\nI have gotten great advice all.  Our doors are all open and animals roam free which normally works great.  But we will re work some things in the house and help him and our animals be safe.   I also loved the advice to help him see cues from the kitty or any animal that they need to have a break from us.  That was very helpful today.<br/>\n&quot;We&quot; do all love the chicks and the kitty and we were all sad.  I am not sure why there is a problem with me stating that in a we manner as our entire household has to be a part of this.  It effects all of us.<br/>\nAlso to be clear, I did not want to get mental help for my son, I was concerned after 1 person wrote me off list practically demanding that I should.  So when Sandra used that word in sort of a confusing manner I was curious about others opinions.<br/>\nThank you everyone for your thoughtful ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarymama to Dylan (11), Colin (7) and Theo (3)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60287,"nextTopicId":60375}}
