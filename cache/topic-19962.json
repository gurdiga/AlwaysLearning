My<br/>\neldest is 14.  Almost all of my friends whose children attend school<br/>\nmake constant reference getting their children to leave home -- and<br/>\nsome of them even talk about remodeling their kids&#39; rooms so they<br/>\ncan&#39;t move back home!  It makes me sad to hear people talk that way<br/>\nabout their children -- I wonder how safe their kids feel inside their<br/>\nhomes, or if they even feel at home in their homes with their parents<br/>\nall the time talking about getting them out the moment they turn 18 of<br/>\ngraduate from high school. Those parents have adversarial<br/>\nrelationships with their kids -- I always hear them arguing and<br/>\nshouting at each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just can&#39;t imagine my son leaving home in four or five years.  I<br/>\nthink he wants to go to college because when we&#39;ve visited college<br/>\ncampuses he&#39;s really expressed joy at the being surrounded by an<br/>\nacademic environment.  The two colleges that he&#39;s indicated interest<br/>\nin attending are in-state and one is right in our local community. <br/>\nAnother friend whose daughter has expressed interest in attending the<br/>\nsame school said that even though that school is right in our own<br/>\nbackyard, she&#39;s going to insist that her daughter live in the dorms<br/>\nbecause &quot;it&#39;s part of the college experience.&quot;  When I share my<br/>\nthoughts about not looking forward to the day when my child leaves the<br/>\nnest, they all tell me -- &quot;Just wait a couple of years -- then you<br/>\nwill!&quot;  Will I? Don&#39;t think so! This nuclear nest-shoving is an<br/>\nunnatural state of being for families.  How did we ever get to the<br/>\npoint where it became the expected &quot;norm&quot; to separate from the family<br/>\nat age 18 or 21?  Isn&#39;t that just another institutionalized<br/>\nschool-directed imposition on family life?  At what cost to society? <br/>\n What is the supposed benefit of having children leave home so early? <br/>\n       <br/>\n~ Alicia                         <br/>\n<br/>\nTia wrote: ---snip--- All his friends go to school, and some<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   graduated this year.

He kept bumping it and <br/>\nsleeping on it, etc. Then the doc put on a half cast, which helped until <br/>\nthe pain was less. The half cast was held on with a tensor bandage. Then he <br/>\ndiscovered an elbow brace, an elastic sleeve that goes around the elbow. <br/>\nThat&#39;s done the trick, and now he rarely needs it.

I know you don&#39;t expect Kirby to<br/>\n  be doing certain things by certain ages, like leaving home or going to<br/>\n  university next year, for instance. I&#39;m curious how you (and others) think<br/>\n  about kids being ready to move on from home. Lars would graduate next<br/>\n  spring if he&#39;d been in school. All his friends go to school, and some<br/>\n  graduated this year. From their parents I hear a constant pushing. &quot;Get a<br/>\n  job, etc.&quot; It feels like they&#39;re in such a hurry to push their kids out<br/>\n  into the world. Even dh has talked about how Lars might want to be on his<br/>\n  own soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t have a problem with him wanting to get out on his own, whenever<br/>\n  that happens. But I also don&#39;t want him to feel pushed. He still hasn&#39;t<br/>\n  figured out what he wants to do with his life. His major interests<br/>\n  (softball, soccer, mountain biking, and film editing) don&#39;t look like they<br/>\n  lead into careers, except the film editing, but his interest there is<br/>\nquite<br/>\n  narrow (mountain biking videos).<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve encouraged his involvement with all of those. We&#39;ve also talked about<br/>\n  blue collar trades, since he&#39;s such a hands-on guy. He doesn&#39;t like book<br/>\n  learning and really dislikes writing. I know for the trades he&#39;s going to<br/>\n  need a certain level of math and language arts, depending on the trade.<br/>\n  I&#39;ve told him we&#39;re glad to help when he wants to work on those things. He<br/>\n  says he does but doesn&#39;t do much about it. No problem. I&#39;m not in a hurry.<br/>\n  Any thoughts on this?<br/>\n  Tia<br/>\n  ps Even though he still isn&#39;t playing because of his broken arm, his team<br/>\n  won the right yesterday to represent Western Canada in the International<br/>\n  Softball Congress in Fargo, ND next month. It&#39;s fairly certain he&#39;ll be<br/>\n  playing again by then. Yippee!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

She has returned to college for a second degree in a different career.  She is having problems with them accepting some of her credits.  They want to give her a 2.0 for classes she is transferring, because Evergreen doesn&#39;t give grades.  They give detailed evaluations instead.  Because she is now pursuing a degree in a competitive field, her GPA could make a difference.  She is neither a teen nor an unschooler, so her experience may be irrelevant to an unschooled young person.

When I got my first position after<br/>\ncollege I was amazed at how much more I had to learn on the job.  It was<br/>\nmuch easier to learn how to prepare molar solutions because I had to for<br/>\nmy job than it was in the abstract in college.  I&#39;m sure the same is<br/>\ntrue for journeyman carpenters/electricians/plumbers/etc.  If he has any<br/>\ninterest in learning any job, see if you can find someone willing to let<br/>\nhim shadow them for a day (or a week, or whatever).  <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m sure he&#39;ll find something he loves to do (or something he can do to<br/>\npay bills so he can do the thing he loves) - it sounds like he&#39;s good at<br/>\nfollowing his interests :-)<br/>\n <br/>\nAlyson<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nTia wrote, in part.<br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t have a problem with him wanting to get out on his own, whenever <br/>\nthat happens.

It&#39;s especially hard on him  when a kid is asking <br/>\nwhile I&#39;m not nearby.

He&#39;s 10!&quot;  I don&#39;t particularly  like referring to him having a &quot;school&quot;, <br/>\nbut the point now, here, with new  people, is to help him avoid embarrassment <br/>\nor feeling &quot;different&quot; or &quot;odd&quot;,  which seems to be an issue with him lately. <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nHe really wants me to step in with adults, because their questions can be  <br/>\nmore pointed.  He hesitates to use the word &quot;homeschooled&quot; for some  reason. I <br/>\nhave heard him say he was &quot;unschooled&quot; to one kid, though, but  then he <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t explain it to the kid&#39;s satisfaction and asked me to explain  it.  The kid <br/>\nlost interest, but I doubt he&#39;ll be willing to use the word  again except in <br/>\nthe right circumstances and/or when he gets more confidence in  handling people.<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] what to say","postDate":"1089027168","msgId":19966,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5Zi4yNjk3ZDlmOS4yZTFhOTY2MEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":19965,"nextInTopic":19967,"prevInTime":19965,"nextInTime":19967,"topicId":19962,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/5/2004 2:27:26 AM Eastern Daylight Time, joylyn@earthlink.net writes: Is that  your mother?
