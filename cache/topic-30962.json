I work in a theatre, and often, if there is an<br/>\nissue,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am on the radio asking &quot;house right or stage right&quot;? &gt;&gt;&gt; me<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;In Australia this is dealt with by following the English system of Prompt<br/>\nand Opposite Prompt (OP). The visiting Americans from touring productions<br/>\nwere always confused and would always say &quot;OP right&quot; ( ie Stage Right).&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L. Coburn<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is probably a matter of me overthinking it.  A typical situation might<br/>\ninclude a patron messing with some part of the set, climbing on the stage,<br/>\nor being in possession  of a camera. (varies)  I work in operations.  The<br/>\nstage manager is usually the first to notice it.  The call will come from<br/>\nthe box, which in physical proximity, is facing the same direction as the<br/>\naudience.  But, I would assume that the stage manager would use the same<br/>\ndirections as the cast and crew, regardless of where the individual is<br/>\nphysically standing.  This is further complicated by the call coming to me<br/>\nthrough the house manager, who may or may not change it around to fit her<br/>\nperspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t know about the English terms.  That is interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\nCindy in SoCal<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30908,"nextTopicId":30933}}
