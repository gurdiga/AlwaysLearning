So<br/>\nanyhow, I have to get myself one of those weather<br/>\ndo-dads that tell the pressure changes, and be careful<br/>\nof what I eat, and not go in the car if I can help it,<br/>\nwhen it stormy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of falling Sandra, I fell out of a tree (6<br/>\nfeet or so) when I was trimming it up in preperation<br/>\nfor dropping it here in our woods.  We are building. <br/>\nDon&#39;t ask, it was really stupid.  Anyway, I was mostly<br/>\nalright, having caught myself by hugging the tree on<br/>\nthe way down, and the cuts from the saw when it hit my<br/>\narm on the way down, and my other scrapes and bruises,<br/>\nare almost all healed.  This was over a week ago now. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I have one injury that is pretty bad.  I landed on<br/>\na root burl with my shin, there is this huge knot of<br/>\ndamaged tissue just below my knee, and the whole shin,<br/>\nfrom ankle to knee is badly bruised.  I am gimping<br/>\naround and all delicate, low stamina, low mobility. <br/>\nThe kids bump into me and I scream, taking pain pills<br/>\na lot, that sort of thing.  So I am totally<br/>\nsympathetic to your plight.  Hang in there, remember<br/>\nto rest as much as possible to let your body use the<br/>\nenergy to heal.  I keep having to remind myself and<br/>\nthe boys of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9456,"nextTopicId":9452}}
