They love to make camp fires and play &#39;hobos&#39;. They ALWAYS check how windy it is, how dry it is, and have a hose ready.

If you live in the US I bet she will love sparklers around the 4th of July!  And I think most people would agree that the best part about camping is the campfire!  We love collecting fuel for the fire, starting it, adding more wood, watching it grow, watching the flames dance, feeling the heat, roasting leaves, acorns, pinecones, marshmallows, lighting the top of a small stick and pretending to smoke it, boiling water with herbs to see what happens...

It was one of her first words and whenever she sees it (in person or in media) she&#39;s mesmerized and/or makes sure we notice it, too. I&#39;m grateful for her awareness on so many levels, and yesterday I started thinking about it in terms of rules vs. principles.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was cooking her breakfast on a gas stove top and she was standing on a stool watching from a safe distance. When I turned on the flame beneath the pan, the conversation went like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nSparrow: &quot;Fire, very hot&quot;.<br/>\nMe: &quot;That&#39;s right. Do we play with fire?&quot;<br/>\nSparrow: &quot;No, no play with fire.&quot;<br/>\nMe, enthusiastically: &quot;That&#39;s right, we don&#39;t play with fire.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was enthusiastic because every time I&#39;ve asked her if we play with fire (or knives) she&#39;s said yes. And I just smile sweetly and say, &quot;No, we don&#39;t play with fire, it&#39;s very hot and could burn. Ouch.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I started thinking that lots of people do play with fire. When we go camping some older kids are allowed to safely, but actively participate in building and maintaining the fire. And roasting marshmallows probably looks like playing with fire. We occasionally see fire dancers, who are certainly playing with fire. And most recently was her 2nd birthday; leading up to it she loved practicing blowing out the candles, which, from her perspective probably is playing with fire.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe principle is to stay safe, but it seems to come out sounding like a rule (&quot;Don&#39;t play with fire&quot;) that is often broken. She doesn&#39;t seem confused, yet, but I can&#39;t see how this would make sense to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember from reading here that short and sweet explanations are best: using too many words isn&#39;t helpful for someone so young. So, how do I make this distinction for her in a way that keeps her safe but doesn&#39;t seem like I&#39;m just being arbitrary?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nlove, sarah<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71292,"nextTopicId":71299}}
