I fell in love with him in 1983, I <br/>\nknow, I know.....a little late for you &quot;old time&quot; fans. But he was sooooo <br/>\nsexy in &quot;Let&#39;s Dance&quot;. YK?<br/>\nI bought a bunch of his tapes after that and still adore his music. That and <br/>\nhis incredible talent for costuming. I loved him in &quot;Labrynth&quot; too.<br/>\nJulie, <br/>\nI have been doing a lot of searching myself lately. Questioning many, many <br/>\nthings I formerly took for granted as far as religion goes.<br/>\nI love Jesus and consider myself a Christian because of that.<br/>\nI do not see him in churches though. I do not see his spirit in most that <br/>\nclaim Christianity either.<br/>\nMost of this matters not a whit to how I choose to live my life, I know what <br/>\nhas been spoken to my own heart and I just try to follow that.<br/>\nI just understand the questioning and the not wanting to just go to church <br/>\nbecause you&#39;re &quot;supposed&quot; to.<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1468,"nextTopicId":1472}}
