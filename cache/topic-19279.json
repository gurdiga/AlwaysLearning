And I love what I <br/>\nhave seen--because as I begin to try these things out slowly on my dd <br/>\nwho is nearly 3 I am seeing wonderful improvements in her--especially <br/>\nin her confidence levels.  (Ok--so she&#39;s thrilled I let her scrub <br/>\nveggies and wash her own face!)  But did you know anyone can use the <br/>\nword Montessori and open a school under the Montessori name?  Not all <br/>\nschools are created equal.  As I am still setting up my homeschool <br/>\nplan (my ds is 7 months old), my friend, the Montessori teacher, is <br/>\ntaking me on  tours of local Montessori schools.  Maria Montessori <br/>\ndeveloped her system in the early 1900s--and didn&#39;t copyright a thing-<br/>\n-so there are a great many out there not teaching the Montessori <br/>\nmethods and still raking in the Montessori bucks.  I do not claim to <br/>\nknow everything about Montessori--or even much at all--and I <br/>\nrecognise that to do things the way Maria Montessori teaches requires <br/>\nat least 20 children in order to do it properly (as my friend <br/>\nconstantly points out to me).  But from what I do see and from what I <br/>\ndo understand--there is absolutely not one thing wrong with using the <br/>\nMontessori training methods at home.  And for my friend teaching <br/>\nMontessori to homeschoolers has worked so well that she is now <br/>\nteaching the children of her former students--at home.<br/>\nI am not trying to advocate Montessori over any other method--for me <br/>\nit was a place to begin for my children because of my friend.  I have <br/>\nunschooled myself ever since about 5th-6th grade--when public schools <br/>\nbegan and continued to let me down.  Imagine my surprise when <br/>\nvocational schools and college classes also let me down when I fell <br/>\nunder pressure to conform and &#39;earn&#39; a &#39;proper education&#39;.  I am an <br/>\neclectic learner--and I&#39;ve never tried to teach anyone other than <br/>\nmyself--which is why I have been reaching out to every resource I <br/>\nknow in order to find something that will work for us--until the kids <br/>\nlook at me and say I want to do this--otherwise every moment with <br/>\nthem has been and always shall be a learning experience on both sides-<br/>\n-but now I have a model upon which to structure things--in case I <br/>\never need to explain to the state here&#39;s what we do and why.<br/>\nThat&#39;s just my 2 cents worth--thank you for listening.<br/>\nNamaste--<br/>\nTabitha</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":157714996,"authorName":"sharonjrt","from":"&quot;sharonjrt&quot; &lt;sharonjrt@...&gt;","profile":"sharonjrt","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: reply to mom&#39;s letter","postDate":"1082114454","msgId":19302,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM1b2ZpbStldTA2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQwN0NDMEQwLjUwMDA3MDZAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":19290,"nextInTopic":19331,"prevInTime":19301,"nextInTime":19303,"topicId":19279,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
