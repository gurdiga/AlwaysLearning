Mom and son sitting on couch watching TV.  All you can  hear is <br/>\nthe sountrack of the movie, and there&#39;s dialog between a man and a woman  and <br/>\nthen a bad guy comes in.  Then you hear all this violence and hitting  and a gun <br/>\nfiring.  When that&#39;s all over, the woman on TV says something  like, &quot;My <br/>\nhero...give me a kiss&quot; then there&#39;s sound of kissing, etc.  At  this point the mom <br/>\non the couch reaches over with her hand and covers the boy&#39;s  eyes.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThen the line, &quot;Watch and Learn&quot; appears and it&#39;s over.<br/>\n <br/>\nI thought it was cool.  <br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20887,"nextTopicId":20890}}
