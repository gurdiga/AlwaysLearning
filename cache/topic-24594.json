I  recognize <br/>\nseveral posters on this list from a previous list I was on, and am  thrilled that <br/>\nI have found my way back to the people who have contributed much  to my <br/>\nparental style and our overall lifestyle changes!  We are in Georgia,  and have <br/>\nfound our way to unschooling after much reading, soul searching,  deschooling and <br/>\nrethinking.  We have a ways to go on our journey, but we  are enjoying the <br/>\ntrip now!<br/>\n <br/>\nI have a comment and a question.  The comment is about the mopping  posts <br/>\nI&#39;ve been seeing - they made me laugh out loud!  I do very little  mopping, <br/>\nbecause I hate it.  Lucky for me, after my 5 year  old daughter and her friend next <br/>\ndoor watched Little Orphan Annie, the activity  of choice has been getting <br/>\nthese huge sponges wet and singing &quot;It&#39;s a Hard Knock  Life&quot; or whatever that <br/>\nsong is, and zooming across the floor.  They have  been doing it for a couple of <br/>\nmonths now whenever her friend is over and I have  to say my floors haven&#39;t <br/>\nbeen this clean in ages :)<br/>\n <br/>\nMy question is this:  my two youngest are a 4yo boy and a 5yo  girl.  Next up <br/>\nthe line is my 7yo son.  These three seem to fight with  each other almost <br/>\nnonstop, and go to great lengths to annoy the heck out of each  other.  They <br/>\nargue over everything, it seems - and my daughter especially  gets very upset and <br/>\nloud when they argue.  My 7yo is more of the quietly  annoy and look innocent <br/>\ntype :)  My 4yo seems to have some violent  tendencies - he doesn&#39;t hit or <br/>\nkick people or anything, but he constantly says  things like &quot;and then, I cut <br/>\nyour head off,&quot; or &quot;you&#39;re dead now,&quot; or &quot;I chop  off your arms and legs,&quot; <br/>\nsometimes calling people stupid, grabbing items out of  other&#39;s hands and things of <br/>\nthat nature.  Some of his behavior is rude, and  some of it just makes other <br/>\nkids that don&#39;t know him well uncomfortable.   He has been crazy for Lord of <br/>\nthe Rings ever since it came out, so most of his  life.  He adores anything <br/>\nthat deals with swords, guns, martial arts,  etc.  I worry because he seems so <br/>\nyoung and he is a real sweetie, very  loving and adores his older siblings, but <br/>\nhe plays rough and acts mean  sometimes.  He constantly repeats lines he hears <br/>\nin movies and acts out  scenes he found particularly interesting (I wish I <br/>\nhad a dollar for every time  he yelled &quot;You..shall not...pass!&quot; like Gandalf!).  <br/>\nSo far we do a lot of  talking about respecting other people&#39;s personal space <br/>\nand property, and  reminding that we should ask before using someone else&#39;s  <br/>\ntoy/scooter/whatever.  Most of the items in our house are community  property, <br/>\nbut there are a few things that my 7yo has bought that he doesn&#39;t  want the <br/>\n&quot;little kids&quot; to mess with.  I have asked them to tell  each other what they <br/>\nwant, etc.  It just doesn&#39;t seem to be working.   I&#39;m kind of at a loss as my <br/>\noldest (twins) are pretty laid back and there are 5  years between them and my <br/>\n7yo, so there wasn&#39;t any sort of &quot;sibling rivalry&quot; or  anything like that when <br/>\nmy oldest were little.  I keep thinking that maybe  Daniel (the 4yo) feels <br/>\npowerless somehow, or is just trying to be older, or  something, but frankly I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know what else to do.  Any  suggestions/thoughts would be appreciated!<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\nStephanie S. in Georgia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24593,"nextTopicId":24553}}
