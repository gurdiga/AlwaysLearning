The anticipation, the colors, the sounds, ordering what you want, and getting a frozen treat from a truck on a hot day.  It is magic!  <br/>\n<br/>\nAbout two years ago an ice cream truck drove down our street.  By the time Dennis found shoes and some cash he had to chase the ice cream truck down.  He was running, yelling, and waving his hand in the air (he was carrying Megan too).  The truck finally stopped and Megan got her ice cream.  She might have eaten it all, but maybe not.  I don&#39;t remember and she probably doesn&#39;t either.  But she remembers her the time her dad chased down an ice cream truck just for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf an ice cream truck stops anywhere near us, I know Megan is going to want ice cream.  As someone else said, it is sort of the cost of being there.  Just like I know that if Megan and I go to the mall we will be stopping at the play area, looking at Webkinz and buying a pretzel.  And if I go to the mall with Dennis add Radio Shack & Sharper Image to the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nMegan&#39;s birthday is coming up in a few weeks.  Balloons and decorations are a must.  But birthdays only come once a year.  I love finding opportunities to make her smile every day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGwen<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Thu, 7/17/08, Crystal Miller &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:willowsfortress@...\">willowsfortress@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Last summer, the ice cream man KNEW our Tribe was at the park every Monday.
