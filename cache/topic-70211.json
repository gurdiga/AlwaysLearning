He&#39;s clearly interested in what he&#39;s doing, he can&#39;t help learning, help him to find more ways to play with the ideas he&#39;s playing with. He&#39;s exploring something that you don&#39;t know about, so maybe it would be learning for you to figure out what is fascinating him. <br/>\n<br/>\nHave you seen this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_viuM_sEOOU?\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_viuM_sEOOU?</a> What about Stomp: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu15Ou-jKM0?\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu15Ou-jKM0?</a> or <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU25GCqE6RM.%c2%a0\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU25GCqE6RM.%c2%a0</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI would look for things varying things that make a good noise. Noises are cool. Maybe you could go to parks with a stick and walk by fences and make that fabulous noise. Or turn a bike upside down and put cards in the spokes and then move the wheels so that you get that clicking noise. Or you could make a rubber band guitar <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFB8f60PjIo.\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFB8f60PjIo.</a> Oh, water in bottles and you blow over the top, or glasses with varying amounts of water that you hit with a spoon. <br/>\n<br/>\nWashing machines are pretty cool, too. Maybe you could see if a local museum has a mangle. Or a washboard. Maybe you could combine music and laundry by getting him a washboard to play with. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexBL5eToE\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexBL5eToE</a> has a wonderful washboard. Or look on Craig&#39;s List for a dead washing machine to take apart so that he could see the parts of it, if that was a bit of his interest. What about going to a laundromat? A room full of washing machines and driers. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I imagined that by the time he was 5 we would spend our days doing all sorts of things like drawing, building, dressing up, visiting museums,playing video games, having long conversations etc&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Someone once wrote about going to an alternative school where the children were playing outside all day long and not sitting in a room with a computer and that she envied what her children were not. It is a costly thing that envy. It can end with you resenting your child for being something other than who you wanted them to be and end with your child having both dissatisfaction with who they are and a deep resentment toward you. It is better to let go of an image of who your child ought to be and to learn to embrace who they are. Let go of that imagined 5 year old boy and hang out with the real one in front of you. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: cathsarwood &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cswoodward@...\">cswoodward@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nCc: <br/>\nSent: Monday, 7 January 2013, 7:51<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Limited interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore I get to my question, here is some background: I have a son aged 5 and a daughter aged 1.  My son has never been in school (the legal &quot;school age&quot; here is 5 and most children start school at 4) and I&#39;ve been learning about unschooling for about three years.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is rather quirky.  He doesn&#39;t play like other children his age (that I know) and tends to focus on one or two interests for weeks or months at a time.  I don&#39;t mean being fascinated with a topic he could dive into, like dinosaurs.
