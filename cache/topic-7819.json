When he was a baby he had<br/>\nthese big Gerberesque ringlets in the back.  I got a<br/>\nlot of flak from people like my mother, who nagged<br/>\nabout getting his hair cut, and I worried that my love<br/>\nof his ringlets was going to cause him embarrasing or<br/>\nhumiliating moments.  When he was 2, my husband (who<br/>\nkeeps his hair very short but has nothing against long<br/>\nhair) took him to get his first haircut and almost<br/>\nbuzz cut him.  I cried.  Who was this little boy, and<br/>\nwhere was my baby with the plump cheeks and the soft<br/>\nringlets?<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout 10 months ago I was trimming his older brother&#39;s<br/>\nhair, who likes it in sort of a dutch boy, but up and<br/>\nover the ears and above the collar in back, and when<br/>\nit was Alex&#39;s turn he clapped his hands over his head<br/>\nand said &quot;NO!  NO HAIRCUT!&quot;  I blinked at him. <br/>\n&quot;What?&quot;  I said.  &quot;No HAIRCUT!&quot; he asserted, while<br/>\nguarding his precious locks.  I was amused, but<br/>\nfigured he just didn&#39;t want a haircut right then,<br/>\nmaybe later.  Wrong.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou have to understand about this kid.  He has ever<br/>\nbeen subject to the whims and machinations of his<br/>\noverbearing elder brother who has a passionate,<br/>\nartistic temperment and thinks he is King of the<br/>\nHouse.  Alex, by nature is a very sweet, gregarious,<br/>\nfriendly kid.  EVERYONE likes him, no, loves him.  He<br/>\ngets along easily with anyone, and at 4 is not shy<br/>\nabout striking up a conversation with anyone,<br/>\nanywhere.  He&#39;ll also take a walk with anyone or go in<br/>\nanyone&#39;s car, which scares me.  But since he is never<br/>\naway from me, the fear is generally a passing thought.<br/>\n Alex has a great sense of humor, an easy laugh, and a<br/>\nquiet self assurance.  He is easily affectionate, with<br/>\na hug for anyone who needs one and a hand for anyone<br/>\nto hold.  He still likes to be &quot;hold like a baby&quot;<br/>\ndespite the fact that he is bigger than his older<br/>\nbrother in height and weight.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat he has never been is assertive, until now.  His<br/>\nhair was the first thing he ever really put his foot<br/>\ndown about.  I didn&#39;t really understand at first that<br/>\nhe was saying NO HAIRCUTS ANYMORE.  He will allow that<br/>\nI occassionally trim his bangs, but he is vigalent to<br/>\nprevent any overtrimming.  He gets comments from<br/>\npeople, but not too many negative ones, living on the<br/>\nOlympic Peninsula like we do.  I have a friend who<br/>\nsays it&#39;s &quot;takes her right back&quot; because he looks like<br/>\nDavid Cassidy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think his hair issue was his first attempt at real<br/>\nautonomy, after being under the thumb of his brother<br/>\nall his young life.  It met with such success that he<br/>\nis asserting himself in other areas, and has started<br/>\nfighting back against his brother&#39;s pushiness.  His<br/>\nlatest crusade is a naked one.  He prefers not to wear<br/>\nclothes, even underwear.  He goes naked much of every<br/>\nday, putting on maybe a sweatshirt when he gets cold,<br/>\nand getting dressed if we go out.  We don&#39;t let him<br/>\nrun around outside naked, because we have weird<br/>\nneighbors, but we are moving in a week to our new 16<br/>\nacres and he will be free from the prying eyes of<br/>\nstrange neighbors.  I am sure he will like that, since<br/>\njust yesterday I had to pull him from his spot on the<br/>\nporch in a very nice sunbeam outside.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSign up for SBC Yahoo!
