My name<br/>\n&gt; is Sheila and I <br/>\n&gt; have homeschooled my dd 11 1/2 and ds 9 1/2 since<br/>\n&gt; birth.  I asked my <br/>\n&gt; dd and ds recently if they were excited to start<br/>\n&gt; school in <br/>\n&gt; September.  He was and she said she wasn&#39;t.  That<br/>\n&gt; was it.  I knew <br/>\n&gt; after much experience with trying every curriculum<br/>\n&gt; out there that I <br/>\n&gt; better start to deschool myself and allow both of<br/>\n&gt; them to unschool.  <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been afraid because of the &quot;what should be<br/>\n&gt; done&quot; in my head <br/>\n&gt; routine.  I&#39;m not anymore.  I read the Unschooling<br/>\n&gt; Handbook and found <br/>\n&gt; it my favorite homeschooling book ever.  I&#39;ve just<br/>\n&gt; finished reading <br/>\n&gt; Real-Life Homeschooling which consists of 21<br/>\n&gt; different families.  <br/>\n&gt; This book allowed me to find what my thoughts and<br/>\n&gt; philosophies always <br/>\n&gt; were deep deep down.  Any story I read about the<br/>\n&gt; child unschooling I <br/>\n&gt; loved.  When I would read about the families that<br/>\n&gt; used a boxed <br/>\n&gt; curriculum I myself would break out in a cold sweat<br/>\n&gt; knowing how it <br/>\n&gt; has not worked here. (Could only imagine what my<br/>\n&gt; daughter thinks.) I <br/>\n&gt; said to my husband a couple of weeks ago, &quot;If I<br/>\n&gt; allowed her to <br/>\n&gt; unschool - she would soar!&quot;  My husband and I<br/>\n&gt; discussed it further <br/>\n&gt; and knew this is what we need to do.  I did not<br/>\n&gt; commit to this for my <br/>\n&gt; children (1) to hate learning and (2) butting heads<br/>\n&gt; with my dd on a <br/>\n&gt; day to day basis.  It seems to be that way lately<br/>\n&gt; and I feel down and <br/>\n&gt; out about it.  SO, HERE WE ARE!  I look forward to<br/>\n&gt; hearing how you <br/>\n&gt; Let Go and let them learn in freedom.  I intend to<br/>\n&gt; read, read read <br/>\n&gt; and keep my mouth shut in order to learn myself and<br/>\n&gt; let my kids learn <br/>\n&gt; in freedom.  Thanks for listening.  I plan on<br/>\n&gt; putting this on another <br/>\n&gt; loop I joined, so if you read it twice, I apologize<br/>\n&gt; - just looking to <br/>\n&gt; get good advice wherever I can!  Toodles.
