It&#39;s a show we&#39;ve enjoyed, and we were both excited at the thought of watching all the seasons, in order, from the 1st episode. The very first episode is all about how, even though JD is now a doctor, he still needs his friends, and they still need each other. The theme song of the show echoes this concept; its lyrics are &quot;I can&#39;t do it all on my own, no, I&#39;m no Superman.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter we watched the first episode, I was getting ready for bed. Seth asked if I would watch something in his room with him for a few minutes, and I said Sure, as soon as I shut down the computer. Well... before I shut down the computer, I decided to &quot;just quickly check&quot; my email, and an email led to a link, and I had to fill out a form for work...<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I was doing that, I got a notice that Seth had posted on facebook. His status read, &quot;I&#39;m no Superman.&quot; AH! Right!! He *needs* me!<br/>\n<br/>\nI immediately got off the computer and went to his room, to watch Conan with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe just recently had a growth spurt - at 12, he is nearly 6 feet tall, much taller than me, and taller than his older brother. That doesn&#39;t negate his need for connection and mommying and sharing, though it does make it harder for me to think of that first thing!<br/>\n<br/>\nI had the same thought as Pam when I read your post.

Revel in the gorilla play. He&#39;s having fun, being a kid and wants to share this with you. Wow, that&#39;s fantastic! Be there if he wants you to be there and fill his cup. Your relationship will flourish and you both will feel happy and rewarded. My personal rule is that when Xander asks to spend time with me I never decline. He&#39;s 11 and the cuddle days are waning. I make sure to cherish every moment. <br/>\n<br/>\nRE: Video games: Video games helped Xander learn how to read. He learns reasoning, problem solving and even social interaction through his video games.
