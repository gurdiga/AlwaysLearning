I hope my<br/>\nson in a similar situation would handle it as well as<br/>\nyour son did, ie  next day apologize on his own, day<br/>\nof incident acknowledge wrongdoing.  Wow!  What a<br/>\nresponsible son.  He really deseves to hear that<br/>\nalthough he made a mistake he handled it really well.<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds to me like your friend, the other mom, is<br/>\nangry.  Instead of being upfront about her feelings<br/>\nshe wants you to punish your son, rather than address<br/>\nher feelings.  She probably thinks that if you would<br/>\nonly punish him, then she wouldn&#39;t feel angry anymore.<br/>\n Well, maybe it would help to acknowledge her unspoken<br/>\nfeelings too.  Something like, &quot;I really hear that you<br/>\nare upset about this, and I can understand that you<br/>\nmight be angry that your son was bitten, I would be<br/>\ntoo if i where in your shoes.  It must feel hard to<br/>\nplace your son in our care, and then not be there to<br/>\nprotect him when something like this happens.  I am<br/>\nsorry too that this happened.&quot;  Perhaps if she can<br/>\nfeel acknowledged in this way some of her own anger<br/>\nwill disipate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t change your parenting style because she is<br/>\nuncomfortable with it.  She can learn or not, but you<br/>\ndid a beautiful job.  If she is uncomfortable leaving<br/>\nher son in your care, so be it, but given your<br/>\ndescription I would love for my son to be treated so<br/>\nwell if i ever left him with someone.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this is so hard.  I hope it resolves soon. Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
