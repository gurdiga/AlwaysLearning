Looking at the past, for example to say &quot;I was spanked, but I will not spank my child&quot; or &quot;I was forced to sit at the dining room table and clean my plate, but I will not force my child to eat&quot; can be useful on occasion, if that helps  encourage you to be kind and good to your children.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking at the past to say &quot;I wish there had been more love, peace, kindness, acceptance of who I was, etc. in my life - so I will give that to my child&quot; can be useful, as those principles are key in helping unschooling flourish.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut *dwelling* in the past and trying to provide a child with what a parent wishes s/he had (when you get down to the specific experiences, as opposed to the general principles) runs into danger when you focus more on yourself, and less on the child currently in front of you.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might have wished your parents made you do housework.  But making your child do housework won&#39;t fix that for you.  Your child isn&#39;t you.  See who they are, and support that.

What if there are things that you think you would have found helpful as a child, but that don&#39;t fit in particularly well with unschooling principles?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think the first thing that I do is think about WHY I want to change those things. Something else that is important is to figure out what YOUR principles are. People talk about unschooling principles as though they are the be all end all. Yes, this is a radical unschooling list and that is the focus of all discussions but at the same time one needs to be able to figure out if unschooling is something that he/she can realistically do. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;For instance, I was never made or even asked to do any housework when I was younger (parents wanted me to concentrate on schoolwork) and while I probably wasn&#39;t complaining at the time, I&#39;ve since felt like that was actually a disadvantage - a) I had to teach myself everything about household management, cooking etc from books and websites after I&#39;d moved out, and b) I wonder if I had developed good habits earlier, things wouldn&#39;t be such a struggle for me now?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It helps to break things down a bit and look at them within the context of which they occurred. It seems that you are saying, “My parents didn’t make me do housework, therefore I don’t know how to do housework.” Is it possible that there are other reasons that housework is a struggle for you? A lot of times, people will blame things on their parents or how they were raised so that they don’t have to think about things more deeply. You can use stuff like this to figure out what your core beliefs are. If you think that the only way that you would have learned these skills is to be forcefully taught them, then that might be a hindrance to peaceful unschooling. How else could you have learned those skills? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is it a struggle? Do you lack motivation to do housework? Do you not know how to do it? Could it be that other things are more important to you than housework? I suck at housework and I was made to do it as a child. All that nagging that my mom did about housework didn’t make me develop good habits. It is actually quite the contrary. I was taught how to cook and clean but that doesn’t mean that I actually like those things. Teaching a child something or making them do something is not going to guarantee “good” habits related to those things. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a lot of cases, it will lead to decisions that are reactionary. It really helped me to realize that. When I started unschooling, I was very much in reactionary mode. I was reacting to things, good and bad, and was not stopping to think about things logically or within a larger context. I went through a period where I could tell you every single negative thing that my parents ever did and I was trying NOT to do those things. I was focusing on the negative about my parents and everything else. My relationship with my parents and in-laws became less than wonderful and my relationship with my kids was suffering too. Things didn’t really improve until I stopped focusing on the negative and started focusing on the positive. What did my parents and in-laws do right? I wasn’t seeing any of the good things because I was so focused on the bad. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I had always resolved that when I had children I would encourage them to be more involved in running the home and teach them these skills earlier on. I appreciate that coercion in this area is a big unschooling no-no, but how would I view it, or readjust my own thinking, in light of it being something I wish my parents had been more strict on?! &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It helped me to look at stories where people had families that were strict about those things but had a similar outcome. It doesn’t take much to find stories about adults that say, “My parents made me do (fill in the blank) and now I hate (fill in the blank). For me it isn’t about being strict or not strict. It is about giving my kids information about how the world works. I can show my kids how to do housework and cook without setting up a situation that requires me to be strict. I can share information with my kids without it being part of that either/or dichotomy. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There are things about my childhood that I want to do differently that do fit in with what I&#39;m reading here. Any time there had been an argument or disagreement, or I had behaved &quot;badly&quot;, my mum would sit in my room and talk to me about it for what felt like hours. I don&#39;t remember a single thing she said or a single specific thing that I&#39;d done, just being in tears curled up in a ball because she wouldn&#39;t go away and I couldn&#39;t make it stop. It is not uncommon for me to haves dreams/nightmares now about a lack of privacy or personal space (bedrooms with no doors, showers with no curtains, bathrooms with no locks etc). So now if my children ask me to go away, I am gone, no question.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This line of thinking can be helpful but it can also be hurtful. I used to love sitting and talking for hours, even if it was after I had screwed up. I would much prefer that to the complete withdrawal of attention that my mom would sometimes do. It helped me to realize what I liked and didn’t like but I shouldn’t generalize those things and apply them to my children. I am not my children and my children are not me. I have four girls and each of them are very different and very unique. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But then what do you do with realising in what ways you were controlled or coerced, and how potentially damaging it was? (I love my mum, but find it difficult to talk to her, and sometimes feel physically very stressed in her presence.) And then when you see grandparents treating your children in a similar way? I love what I&#39;m reading about unschooling, but I&#39;m not enjoying some of the effects of reassessing my own experiences in light of it!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am not sure how to explain this but it seems that focusing on being controlled and coerced is giving away your personal power. Yes, I was controlled and coerced as a child but I do not have to focus on that as I move forward. I sometimes think that people get so caught up in the past that they let their pasts control them. There is a good chance that the grandparents are doing the only thing that they know. Grandparents have been around for a really long time. It helps to look at the historical context of when they were living.  A lot of the control and coercion that my parents (and other adults) used were done because they felt it was necessary. Both of my parents worked when I was younger. They didn’t have the time or freedom to let us stay up late or have a lot of freedom in some things. That’s not to say we didn’t have any freedom. My parents tried to give us a lot of freedom but what they gave to us was always limited by what they had access to and they did not have access to a lot of free time. A lot of times kids are controlled and coerced because parents and grandparents don’t realize that there is any other way. That thinking is a product of the way they were raised. My parents and grandparents are human beings and they have a life time of experiences that are going to influence their thinking and behavior. Very few of them did anything different because they did not have access to the information that is available today. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":343381924,"authorName":"Lucy&#39;s web","from":"Lucy&#39;s web &lt;lucy.web@...&gt;","profile":"lucylists","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] The effects of how you were raised","postDate":"1341153812","msgId":68058,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQ4RkNBNDlBLUMyMzYtNDMyRi05QUMxLTlCNDYwRDY1NUE5NEBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEFFQzc5OUE0LTQ3NjAtNDNGQi1CQTgyLThEMkM5Q0Y2Qzc2NUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGpzcGQwOSs4ZjRiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NEU2RDJEQTctQTUwRC00MzM0LTk5NkQtNTNGMzVENzlFMkZCQG1hYy5jb20+IDwyMDEyMDcwMTEyNTIzMC5HUTIwNjgyQHRoZS5lYXJ0aC5saT4gPDdERkE3NzU1LTUwNkYtNEIwNC04ODRFLThGODJCRTA5OEQxOUBtYWMuY29tPiA8QUVDNzk5QTQtNDc2MC00M0ZCLUJBODItOEQyQzlDRjZDNzY1QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68057,"nextInTopic":68059,"prevInTime":68057,"nextInTime":68059,"topicId":68047,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Once my parents had ascertained that there was solid research behind my parenting choices and it wasn&#39;t just one of &quot;Lucy&#39;s weird ideas&quot; they seemed happy to stand back and see what happened.   8 years on they are both supporters of the unschooling life, so we are lucky in that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne explicit example that sticks in my mind was that whenever I had any kind of &#39;tantrum&#39; as a child, my mother would laugh at me to distract me and joke me out of it.   I hadn&#39;t even realised that this was what she&#39;d been doing until I read how disempowering that is in a parenting book.   I had even caught myself doing it a bit when my oldest child was a toddler.   (She remembers this clearly and also remembers how it felt and we have had a lot of talks about it since).   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I went to collect my girls from Grandma&#39;s house one day, my youngest, Molly, was in a huff on the sofa and Grandma related to me how Molly had been upset over something (I can&#39;t remember what) and Grandma had tried to cheer her up by teasing her out of it, but it hadn&#39;t worked and Molly was still in a grump.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sat next to Molly and gave her a hug and said things along the lines of: &quot;Did it make you feel that Grandma was laughing at you?&quot; � nod � &quot;Did it make you feel like Grandma didn&#39;t care about your feelings?&quot; � nod � etc etc.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI should point out that in my opinion asking direct and suggestive questions like these is not necessarily the best way to empathise with a young child, but I was more focused on making sure that Grandma knew how the situation had felt from Molly&#39;s point of view, and that Molly heard that I was not &quot;taking Grandma&#39;s side&quot;.   Molly and I had our own debrief in the car journey home ;)   Also Molly and I have a particular &#39;rapport&#39; and we usually feel pretty much the same about things � she is as aware of this as I am.   One of the many wonderful things about this is that I get to see how I would have reacted as a child if I had not been so inhibited.  Molly&#39;s refusal to be &#39;coerced&#39; is one of the many things I admire about her!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next time I saw my Mum she commented that she had always tried to joke me out of my tantrums, I replied that I know and appreciate that now, but it didn&#39;t feel like that at the time.  I felt a definite sense of &#39;release&#39; to be able to say it to her.   We&#39;ve never mentioned it since but Grandma doesn&#39;t do that anymore.   Result.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of things that Grandma does that I don&#39;t � yes, she praises, she cajoles, she insists, she even (gasp) sometimes *teaches* � but to my mind as long as my daughters are aware of what&#39;s going on, and don&#39;t overtly mind it, then it&#39;s O.K.   There are lots more &quot;good&quot; things that come from the interaction with my Mum than these slight negatives.   It gives us lots of opportunities for discussing coping strategies (after all they will probably experience this kind of treatment in other places sooner or later).   And, most importantly, my girls know that they can stop visiting her if they want to, and know that I will support them in that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am aware that after an afternoon at Grandma&#39;s, there is a definite &quot;detox&quot; kind of process, where the girls usually play more raucously than usual, or are grumpy for a few hours.   I see this as an important pressure valve and try not to take it personally, while staying available to discuss things if required.   I don&#39;t really question them about it, because I know it&#39;s usually an accumulation of lots of little things rather than any one big thing that they can put their finger on.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor relatives generally I just make it very clear to my children that I am on their side.   I explain &quot;why we do things&quot; to the relative if that seems necessary, but usually as long as my girls know I am not conspiring against them I don&#39;t care that much what  the more distant relatives think.   If my daughters are asked a direct question that I can sense is making them uncomfortable, then I might answer for them, while giving the child in question a wink or a little hug or something, and also leaving plenty of space and opportunity for that child to chime in with something too, if they want to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d definitely say that &#39;debriefing&#39; and discussing it with the children, and brainstorming coping strategies together, is more powerful than anything I can do to specifically try and stop those kinds of thing happening.<br/>\n<br/>\nLucy<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: The effects of how you were raised","postDate":"1341152774","msgId":68053,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpzcG1tNitlNHQ3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGpzcGQwOSs4ZjRiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68052,"nextInTopic":68054,"prevInTime":68052,"nextInTime":68054,"topicId":68047,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It feels different and creates a different set of choices. I&#39;ve seen moms actively prevent kids and spouses from helping around the house - I think it helps them (the moms) feel in control, but it tends to leave others with a sense of helplessness. That&#39;s very, very different from a home where mom graciously does a lot of household work, inviting people to join her or keep her company, offering to show people how things work when and if they&#39;re interested. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I wonder if I had developed good habits earlier, things wouldn&#39;t be such a struggle for me now?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*************<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Develop good habits&quot; is a gigantic myth. Look around at adults you know with messy homes, cars, offices and workshops. Most - the vast majority - were made to participate in housekeeping as kids. The results don&#39;t support the theory. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut it&#39;s a frequent experience of unschoolers for kids to eventually begin helping voluntarily around the house. It starts with small things that you might need to remind yourself to notice - feeding the pets Some of the time. Putting away groceries. My daughter is very good at reminding me and my partner when we run out of things or something needs to get done - that could be irritating if I wasn&#39;t conscious of the fact that She sees herself as being helpful. Then it&#39;s sweet. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s almost eleven and has started bringing dishes to the sink from other rooms, sometimes washing them. That&#39;s sweet and helpful of her. Recently I gave her room a really big cleaning and she liked that and is trying to keep it cleaner - in the past she hasn&#39;t minded clutter and mess, but now she&#39;s finding that she likes to be able to find things without searching. That&#39;s new - in the past searching for things has been part of the process, now she wants to skip ahead to using whatever it is she&#39;s looking for.

My children are 6, 4 and 2, but I could certainly have &quot;behind the scenes&quot; as a mindset, even if they&#39;re not ready for long explanations. I definitely don&#39;t want to &quot;change grandma&quot; and I guess I have to be careful not to come across like that (to her especially!). I think what I meant was I don&#39;t like the way that finding out about a new way of doing things is making me more judgemental/critical of what I see other people doing with my children, and I need to find ways of dealing with that in myself, becoming more tolerant/accepting/forgiving?<br/>\n<br/>\n***May I ask if you&#39;d be prepared to share some explicit examples?***<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this is an example without a solution, but I am now noticing how mum speaks to the children. Lots of telling them what to think, what they&#39;ll like, what they do and don&#39;t want to do, how to behave... Kind of like a running commentary, and I guess quite controlling. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s completely unconscious (she&#39;s a *very* verbal person anyway) but I&#39;d never really thought about it before, and now it&#39;s driving me crazy! I would love to hear more examples from Lucy (and others) that are more constructive!<br/>\n<br/>\n***my girls see housework and cooking going on around them all the time, they already join in a lot with cooking, and sometimes with housework - if they want to.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the encouragement. My girls (never my son, lol) often ask to help me in the kitchen, and I try really hard to say yes. I guess it&#39;s about trusting that doing it this way will be &quot;enough&quot; - I&#39;m so excited about life and learning being more natural and focused on what they really need and want from it, as opposed to what anyone else thinks. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\n<br/>\nClare<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://smoothandeasydays.wordpress.com\">http://smoothandeasydays.wordpress.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] The effects of how you were raised","postDate":"1341148073","msgId":68051,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM0MDZBMTk1LTlCNzYtNERDRi04NEU4LUIzOEQwNEY1Rjk5NUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMTIwNzAxMTI1MjMwLkdRMjA2ODJAdGhlLmVhcnRoLmxpPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpzcGQwOSs4ZjRiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NEU2RDJEQTctQTUwRC00MzM0LTk5NkQtNTNGMzVENzlFMkZCQG1hYy5jb20+IDwyMDEyMDcwMTEyNTIzMC5HUTIwNjgyQHRoZS5lYXJ0aC5saT4="},"prevInTopic":68050,"nextInTopic":68052,"prevInTime":68050,"nextInTime":68052,"topicId":68047,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- but I think as he gets bigger it s likely that they ll start using language (e.g. good boy , other limits/restrictions/pushing) that we re not using.-=- I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-147080018\">-=- but I think as he gets bigger it&#39;s likely that<br/>\nthey&#39;ll start using language (e.g. &quot;good boy&quot;, other<br/>\nlimits/restrictions/pushing) that we&#39;re not using.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think a child hearing &quot;good boy&quot; from a grandparent occasionally is going to hurt him.<br/>\nAsking a grandparent to change all behavior and expectation because the grandchild has parents who&#39;ve decided to be unschoolers would probably do more damage than a hundred &quot;good boy&quot; moments.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] The effects of how you were raised","postDate":"1341147662","msgId":68050,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYyMTFFMEI0LTY4OUQtNERFRi05M0E0LTFERjlGNDM4NUI3OUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDRFNkQyREE3LUE1MEQtNDMzNC05OTZELTUzRjM1RDc5RTJGQkBtYWMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpzcGQwOSs4ZjRiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NEU2RDJEQTctQTUwRC00MzM0LTk5NkQtNTNGMzVENzlFMkZCQG1hYy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":68049,"nextInTopic":68051,"prevInTime":68049,"nextInTime":68051,"topicId":68047,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- I also do a lot of behind the scenes discussions with my children, explaining why Grandma does this, that, or the other, and also explaining why we don t","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1079545140\">-=- I also do a lot of &#39;behind the scenes&#39; discussions with my children, explaining why Grandma does this, that, or the other, and also explaining why we don&#39;t do that in our immediate family.

I have loads of questions, but am not sure how easy it will be to get my thoughts down, so I hope they make sense!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you do with all the things that you want to do differently with your children, as a result of how you were raised? What if there are things that you think you would have found helpful as a child, but that don&#39;t fit in particularly well with unschooling principles?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, I was never made or even asked to do any housework when I was younger (parents wanted me to concentrate on schoolwork) and while I probably wasn&#39;t complaining at the time, I&#39;ve since felt like that was actually a disadvantage - a) I had to teach myself everything about household management, cooking etc from books and websites after I&#39;d moved out, and b) I wonder if I had developed good habits earlier, things wouldn&#39;t be such a struggle for me now?<br/>\n<br/>\nI had always resolved that when I had children I would encourage them to be more involved in running the home and teach them these skills earlier on. I appreciate that coercion in this area is a big unschooling no-no, but how would I view it, or readjust my own thinking, in light of it being something I wish my parents had been more strict on?! <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are things about my childhood that I want to do differently that do fit in with what I&#39;m reading here. Any time there had been an argument or disagreement, or I had behaved &quot;badly&quot;, my mum would sit in my room and talk to me about it for what felt like hours. I don&#39;t remember a single thing she said or a single specific thing that I&#39;d done, just being in tears curled up in a ball because she wouldn&#39;t go away and I couldn&#39;t make it stop. It is not uncommon for me to haves dreams/nightmares now about a lack of privacy or personal space (bedrooms with no doors, showers with no curtains, bathrooms with no locks etc). So now if my children ask me to go away, I am gone, no question.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then what do you do with realising in what ways you were controlled or coerced, and how potentially damaging it was? (I love my mum, but find it difficult to talk to her, and sometimes feel physically very stressed in her presence.) And then when you see grandparents treating your children in a similar way? I love what I&#39;m reading about unschooling, but I&#39;m not enjoying some of the effects of reassessing my own experiences in light of it!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reading, <br/>\n<br/>\nClare<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://smoothandeasydays.wordpress.com\">http://smoothandeasydays.wordpress.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68012,"nextTopicId":67778}}
