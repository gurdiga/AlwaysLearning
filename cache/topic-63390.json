Cindi if you<br/>\nare still reading I&#39;m sorry it hasn&#39;t worked out so far.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAbout 9 months ago my daughter started a minecraft server.   First one she<br/>\never did, yeah, but also the last one possibly.   After a few local<br/>\nhomeschool friends were playing on the server for a few weeks it was decided<br/>\nto invite even more local home educators.  People we didn&#39;t know all that<br/>\nwell.   This started some discussions with other local HE parents.  As a<br/>\nhome educating family running a server one of the many issues we&#39;d not<br/>\nthought about at all but quickly became aware of via emails was the<br/>\ndifferent expectations some people were going to have because this server<br/>\nwas by a HE child (& so family).   We very quickly learned being the host<br/>\nwasn&#39;t going to be nearly so simple to just open the server to &#39;home<br/>\neducators&#39;.   Dd server never was opened up to all the local home educators<br/>\nas she just wanted to play the game and thought she was being nice to open<br/>\nit to others.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the time it felt a little crushing as her mum to see the original<br/>\nexcitement in dd leave her about this.   She was fine pretty quickly about<br/>\nit all though but she did seem to lose all interest in minecraft all<br/>\ntogether after that.   The idea of hosting a place for all these other<br/>\nchildren was a lovely idea but the reality was quite different and not what<br/>\nshe&#39;d been hoping or looking for.   When her computer crashed a month or two<br/>\nlater she didn&#39;t start the server up again.   <br/>\n<br/>\nJoy<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63368,"nextTopicId":63388}}
