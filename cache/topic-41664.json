I&#39;m not sure why I started sounding like someone specifically said<br/>\nreading wasn&#39;t valuable.  Somehow as I was writing my response my<br/>\nthoughts started drifting to defending reading.  Maybe that came out<br/>\nbecause I&#39;m a weekly political columnist for a daily newspaper and find<br/>\nmyself defending things like freedom and letting people live their lives<br/>\nas they see fit a lot. As you all certainly know there are a lot of<br/>\npeople who have trouble with the idea of freedom.  So just dump whatever<br/>\nI said along those lines.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I think everyone was right to point out that the research was done on<br/>\npeople who were all &#39;schooled.&#39; And that&#39;s partly what has kept me<br/>\nwondering all these years, the thought that if we could only do some<br/>\nresearch on unschooled people if the results would be different and<br/>\neveryone could learn how to help people learn, which may be just leaving<br/>\nthem alone of course. :)  Plus just my basic curiosity I guess.  <br/>\n<br/>\n3. If a well-defined scientific study could be done and I&#39;m not even<br/>\nsure it can, that just would be cool. We&#39;ve certainly changed our<br/>\nassumptions about many other things over the centuries as we learn more<br/>\nthrough scientific study. The problem I see in our day and age is that a<br/>\nlot of science is out to defend assumptions rather than coming from the<br/>\nbasic idea of proving what&#39;s true.  Whole industries come out of<br/>\nassumptions, and the remedial reading industry is probably one of them,<br/>\nso you have to be so skeptical and vigilant of any research.  And that&#39;s<br/>\ndifficult and time-consuming.  But I still hold that eventually true<br/>\nscience wins, even if it takes centuries.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. One of the things that has come out of this research is there is<br/>\nsupposedly a way to screen young kids to see if they may have trouble<br/>\nreading.  I&#39;ve watched this play out at the center I worked at and do<br/>\nnot draw any positive conclusions that it&#39;s as predictable as anyone<br/>\nwould like.  When I contacted some of these families a few years later,<br/>\nsome kids were doing fine and others were having trouble, so I saw no<br/>\nevidence that a screening actually did anything. Except to worry parents<br/>\nof course, which may be the inherent idea even if the people think they<br/>\nare well-intentioned and helping the families.  Also, if it does prove<br/>\nto be predictive, it would really only show us it is predictive with<br/>\n&#39;schooled&#39; kids because we are trying so hard to fit everyone in that<br/>\nbox and they must do certain things at certain ages.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. I don&#39;t think I ever said this here yet, but I guess one reason I&#39;ve<br/>\nthought about this so much was due to my personal experience unschooling<br/>\nmy two kids.  My daughter learned to read easily and is as voracious a<br/>\nreader and my father and I. My son wasn&#39;t so interested but I just left<br/>\nhim alone because I believed in my heart that it was natural and he<br/>\nwould learn to read and enjoy it if he could go at his own pace and<br/>\ninterest.  And he did because by the time he was in his mid-teens he<br/>\nstarted reading lots more and he never had any trouble with the reading<br/>\nhe had to do in college.  He&#39;s a great speller too and we did that<br/>\nnaturally as well, interestingly enough he spells better than my<br/>\ndaughter.  Of course we had no trouble finding ways for him to learn<br/>\nwithout reading while he was growing up.  So when I started to learn<br/>\nmore through this job and learn about the research and all, I wondered<br/>\nif we may have just been &#39;lucky&#39; in that they did not have some of these<br/>\nissues.  But right now, I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s probably true that it&#39;s more<br/>\nabout the schooled vs the unschooled rather than any specific brain<br/>\nscience.  I still think we may discover interesting things eventually<br/>\nthrough brain science, it&#39;s certainly an untapped field, a whole new<br/>\nfrontier, a, a,... okay getting a bit weird now, huh? :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDebbie<br/>\nwww.homeschoolingisfreedom.blogspot.com<br/>\nwww.debbieharbeson.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re:Fwd: Unschooling and reading","postDate":"1233788308","msgId":41779,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDkwMjA0MTQ1OHM2OTYxYjAxM2liZTFjZmRjYWYyYzkxMjIzQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDM0MkE4MDkyLTk5NzMtNEQzRC05MkEzLUI0MUU5MTk5RURCQ0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwMDYwMWM5ODZmMCQ5ZTQ5MzI4MCRkMzAxYThjMEBkZWxsbGFwPgkgPDM0MkE4MDkyLTk5NzMtNEQzRC05MkEzLUI0MUU5MTk5RURCQ0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":41777,"nextInTopic":41792,"prevInTime":41778,"nextInTime":41780,"topicId":41664,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... you ll get what we re saying.

I am fascinated by scientific<br/>\nresearch on the brain and since the introduction &gt;of fMRI (functional<br/>\nmagnetic resonance imaging), we are gaining more and more knowledge<br/>\nabout how the brain works every day.  Blood flows to the parts of the<br/>\nbrain that are &gt;working when someone performs a task and fMRI is a way<br/>\nto see and measure the blood flow to various parts of the brain. This<br/>\nfMRI has been used in reading research and it&#39;s &gt;fascinating.  They used<br/>\nfMRI and measured the parts of the brain that were working on good<br/>\nreaders and then on those who were struggling and saw clearly that one<br/>\npart of the &gt;brain was not working on the ones who struggled.  Then the<br/>\ngroup, the ones who were struggling were given lessons specifically<br/>\ngeared to improve phonemic awareness (this is not &gt;the same as phonics<br/>\nby the way), and when they measured them again, that part of the brain<br/>\nthat &#39;lit up&#39; with the good readers also &#39;lit up&#39; with these people. <br/>\nThis was big news in &gt;the reading research field because it clearly<br/>\nshowed that there is a brain-based way of helping people who struggle<br/>\nwith reading.  It&#39;s not that they couldn&#39;t use that part of the brain,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;but that for some reason it wasn&#39;t wired and making the connections it<br/>\n </span></blockquote>was with the people who learn to read easily.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Now<br/>\n </span></blockquote>some of you may be thinking, well who knows if they would not have<br/>\npicked this up naturally.  I can tell you this, that they have done<br/>\nresearch on some who were young and &gt;struggled but had no help and when<br/>\ntested as adults they had the same part of the brain not making the<br/>\nconnections.  And again with those adults, once they were helped with<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;phonemic awareness, their brains behaved the same way and made new<br/>\n </span></blockquote>connections. This is probably where my statements about &#39;ahead&#39; and<br/>\n&#39;behind&#39; came into play because &gt;when those adults were finally taught<br/>\nto read, it didn&#39;t necessarily help them because they had missed so<br/>\nmany years of &#39;practicing&#39; reading that it is very difficult to get<br/>\nthem to read &gt;fluently.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found a the study that uses fMRI and reading. This paper was done in 2003 and only with children 8-12 and not with adults.  It&#39;s a study of children with dyslexia, it&#39;s a study of children in school. If anyone wants to read the study its at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/100/5/2860.full.pdf.\">http://www.pnas.org/content/100/5/2860.full.pdf.</a> The study I found makes no mention of adult students. It does however state that the remedial program that they used (remedial comes with such baggage, doesn&#39;t it?) is in common use which would suggest that any adult who was tested had gone through the programs that should have changed their neural wiring. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been recent papers out about the plasticity of the adult human mind. These adults who you argue are demonstrating a rigid mind, an inability to read as well as a younger reader who has practiced more, are getting the rigidness from somewhere outside of their minds ability to adapt to change. I would imagine that the rigidity comes from years of feeling like they were stupid by being told that reading was the only way to knowledge. Reading is probably not something that gives them a warm feeling inside. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny C","from":"&quot;Jenny C&quot; &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re:Fwd: Unschooling and reading","postDate":"1233786463","msgId":41775,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdtZDRvditvaW5xQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMDYwMWM5ODZmMCQ5ZTQ5MzI4MCRkMzAxYThjMEBkZWxsbGFwPg=="},"prevInTopic":41774,"nextInTopic":41776,"prevInTime":41774,"nextInTime":41776,"topicId":41664,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... plain old life experience too, because I do think that reading is a great way to gain information in an easy and fast manner.

Seen from a distance it&#39;s all by itself and  <br/>\nit&#39;s enormous. What we&#39;re discussing isn&#39;t knocking that tree down.  <br/>\nWe&#39;re saying the other trees -- the other ways of learning -- have  <br/>\nbeen trimmed down so far they&#39;re not even noticed. If the others are  <br/>\nnurtured and seen for their own value, the 50&#39; reading tree is still  <br/>\nthere, but it&#39;s just not all by itself anymore. It&#39;s surrounded by  <br/>\nother valuable ways of learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Yet somehow books still seem to trump that for me because for one  <br/>\n&gt; thing, you don&#39;t need any electricity.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But you&#39;re still thinking in terms of book style information.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you see and value what *can&#39;t* be learned through reading, then  <br/>\nyou&#39;ll get what we&#39;re saying. It&#39;s not that others are more important  <br/>\nthan reading, it&#39;s that others have their own value. Reading is good  <br/>\nfor some things, but not good for other things. Hands on is good for  <br/>\nlearning some things, not as good for other things. Same for all ways  <br/>\nof learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; even after the kids could read, we read aloud and I could read  <br/>\n&gt; books above their reading level and they gained a lot of fun and  <br/>\n&gt; information that way along with their own reading.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They could listen to books on CD if hearing books read was just to  <br/>\ntake in books above their reading level.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven more valuable is shared experience.

Do paste the quote if you  <br/>\ncan.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe situation with book worship is like those black and white photos  <br/>\nwhere one thing is in color to emphasize it. Reading for this society  <br/>\nis in color, all other ways of learning are in black and white. We&#39;re  <br/>\ntrying to help people see that&#39;s just a trick of the photo created by  <br/>\nsociety. All learning is in color. We&#39;re not taking away the color  <br/>\nfrom reading. It&#39;s still just as colorful. But doing, talking,  <br/>\nwatching people and videos, listening and so on are all just as  <br/>\ncolorful if people could finally see how valuable those contributions  <br/>\nare in their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd individuals will find some ways more colorful than others. Some  <br/>\nwill find reading the most colorful. Some will find videos the most  <br/>\ncolorful. Some will find working with their hands the most colorful.  <br/>\nAnd so on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But as to reading in general, I just think it just makes life easier.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Has anyone said reading doesn&#39;t make life easier? Again, if you could  <br/>\nquote that it would be helpful. (Because maybe the words are coming  <br/>\nacross in ways people don&#39;t intend! Maybe it was mine and I need to  <br/>\nknow! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say, yes, in general adults who can&#39;t read will have a  <br/>\ntougher time in life. There&#39;s a lot of information (like filling out  <br/>\nforms, extracting information from schedules) that reading makes lots  <br/>\neasier. There may be things they want to know that aren&#39;t as easily  <br/>\nfound other ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut how many adult illiterates are there who didn&#39;t spend years in  <br/>\nschool with forced reading instruction? Or who grew up in  <br/>\nimpoverished areas where reading wasn&#39;t available. Unfortunately we  <br/>\ncan&#39;t really separate an adult who can&#39;t read from the damage of  <br/>\nbeing demoralized and embarrassed in school because they never  <br/>\nlearned and had to hide it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the subject isn&#39;t adult illiteracy. It&#39;s about teaching children  <br/>\nto read. So, the question relevant to unschooling is does being able  <br/>\nto read at 6 or 8 make life easier for every child?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s another one of those brain traps. School people are used to  <br/>\nthinking in terms of generalizations: what&#39;s good for all 8 yos and  <br/>\n10 yos. They have to treat them as a single unit because schools are  <br/>\nset up to treat them that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut unschoolers don&#39;t. We talk about what does a particular child  <br/>\nneed. A 6 yo who has pleasant experiences with reading but can&#39;t yet  <br/>\nread herself is absorbing from life in other ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when we say all 6, 8 and 10 yos don&#39;t need to read, we *don&#39;t*  <br/>\nmean unschoolers in any way discourage kids from reading! If a child  <br/>\nis ready to read at 6, an unschooled child will be reading then. If  <br/>\nthe child won&#39;t be ready until 12, they&#39;re supported in who they are  <br/>\nwhile they&#39;re learning other ways, and then they read at 12. The  <br/>\nchild hasn&#39;t missed anything. They&#39;ve been doing *other* things that  <br/>\nthey found just as valuable with the time they would have spent reading.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Now some of you may be thinking, well who knows if they would not  <br/>\n&gt; have picked this up naturally.

As I read them all, I tried to jot down some further thoughts and comments and answers to questions posed and I’m sharing them all here in one post.  Hope it makes sense. ☺<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  Several people picked up on my comment about there being ‘no doubt in my mind that someone who can read at a younger age, and enjoys it, can gain so much more information and knowledge and be far ahead of a counterpart who is not gaining that knowledge.&#39;  I appreciate the pointing out of what was really a pretty judgmental point on my part. I was speaking from the experience of that job mostly, yet from my plain old life experience too, because I do think that reading is a great way to gain information in an easy and fast manner. I guess I think of it as an extremely valuable tool for going through life.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Sandra said maybe the importance of books was more true for the 19th century and I think that is a good point.  Now we have lots of ways to get the exact same info that is in books through various audio and video means.  Yet somehow books still seem to trump that for me because for one thing, you don&#39;t need any electricity.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. I agree with whoever made the point about continuing to read aloud even after a child can read.  For years I&#39;ve been pointing this out, that in our family, even after the kids could read, we read aloud and I could read books above their reading level and they gained a lot of fun and information that way along with their own reading.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  I&#39;ve never thought of books as closing one to the real world. I always thought of them as opening many, many new worlds very easily.  Of course I understand that there is a lot of learning that happens outside of books (remember I basically unschooled my own two kids) but I still think reading is such an important and valuable tool.<br/>\n<br/>\n5.  Someone asked why this is even important to me. Well of course it was important to me when I had the job and wondered about it all and I knew part of the problem was that the kids were stuck in school.  But as to reading in general, I just think it just makes life easier.  I mean back to the 19th century comment, while that makes some sense, I can&#39;t help but point out that here we all are, discussing this by reading each other&#39;s points.<br/>\n<br/>\n6.  On being ahead and behind.  Another good catch to point out that my comments were being affected by the situation I was in and yet, I guess I do consider reading and books just, well, an efficient way to gain information. And that&#39;s important for me because I use the information to stop and think.  I&#39;ve realized over the year though that a lot of people don&#39;t stop and think and ponder and consider, so the point made about how a lot of people who can read don&#39;t necessarily think is very true.  So perhaps the most important piece here is not reading per se, but the ability and desire to really think things through in depth.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. On the rewiring of the brain.  This is the one thing that probably kept me going in the job for so long. I am fascinated by scientific research on the brain and since the introduction of fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging), we are gaining more and more knowledge about how the brain works every day.  Blood flows to the parts of the brain that are working when someone performs a task and fMRI is a way to see and measure the blood flow to various parts of the brain. This fMRI has been used in reading research and it&#39;s fascinating.  They used fMRI and measured the parts of the brain that were working on good readers and then on those who were struggling and saw clearly that one part of the brain was not working on the ones who struggled.  Then the group, the ones who were struggling were given lessons specifically geared to improve phonemic awareness (this is not the same as phonics by the way), and when they measured them again, that part of the brain that &#39;lit up&#39; with the good readers also &#39;lit up&#39; with these people.  This was big news in the reading research field because it clearly showed that there is a brain-based way of helping people who struggle with reading.  It&#39;s not that they couldn&#39;t use that part of the brain, but that for some reason it wasn&#39;t wired and making the connections it was with the people who learn to read easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow some of you may be thinking, well who knows if they would not have picked this up naturally.  I can tell you this, that they have done research on some who were young and struggled but had no help and when tested as adults they had the same part of the brain not making the connections.  And again with those adults, once they were helped with phonemic awareness, their brains behaved the same way and made new connections. This is probably where my statements about &#39;ahead&#39; and &#39;behind&#39; came into play because when those adults were finally taught to read, it didn&#39;t necessarily help them because they had missed so many years of &#39;practicing&#39; reading that it is very difficult to get them to read fluently.<br/>\n<br/>\n8.

He is 6 and last year just started to read.  <br/>\nSome days he reads everything he sees, from serial boxes, to direction <br/>\non an expirement kits.  Other days he reads nothing. (or atleast not <br/>\noutloud).  He wasnt taught to read, I can claim no credit, he just <br/>\nasked a few questions like, &quot;ing&quot; says ing right.  Or is that a b or a <br/>\nd, it says &quot;b&quot;, right?  Or can you read this sentence then I will read <br/>\nthat one.  <br/>\nMy 7 year old has made a few comments about his brothers reading.  He <br/>\nbelieves he should have learned to read before him since he is older.  <br/>\nI explain that isnt how it works. And he will learn when he is ready. <br/>\nHe doesnt have the same interest in words.  Everyonce in a while he <br/>\nwill see something and read it.  But I in absolutely no way feel he <br/>\nlearns less because he doesnt read yet.  Matter of fact, during that <br/>\ntime schooled kids are being force fed phonics, my son is discovering <br/>\nthings, playing, looking at pictures, listening to books on tape, <br/>\nexpirementing, creating.  He just has better things to do right now.  <br/>\nIts like putting a kid to bed before they are tired enough to go to <br/>\nsleep... just a waste of time and a power struggle.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Fwd: Unschooling and reading","postDate":"1233635865","msgId":41701,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQ2RDJFQkFELUY4RDQtNDgwMy05MDEzLTE4NjNFREIxREE0NUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDlmNzJkNzYyMDkwMjAyMTQwMms1NjYzZGYxaGVmN2IyMWEzMzA5NmE0NTZAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGdtN2Y5cithcTRlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NzRCMjJBMzgtMjdDRS00Njk4LTk3RUEtQTE0RTA4Q0JDMDBBQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8OWY3MmQ3NjIwOTAyMDIxNDAyazU2NjNkZjFoZWY3YjIxYTMzMDk2YTQ1NkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":41692,"nextInTopic":41719,"prevInTime":41700,"nextInTime":41702,"topicId":41664,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-My mom was expressing a polite level of skepticism about what the woman had said and the other woman s very earnest reply was, But Mariana, it must be","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1410694209\">-=-My mom was expressing a polite level of skepticism about what<br/>\nthe woman had said and the other woman&#39;s very earnest reply was, &quot;But<br/>\nMariana, it must be true.

I yelled &quot;Let&#39;s go!&quot; and we ran up the  <br/>\nroad, and ran, and ran. About seven houses up we got tired, and I said  <br/>\n&quot;Look&quot; and pointed back toward our house, which was gone in the fog.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did NOT say &quot;See?

Is  <br/>\nit possible the kids who don&#39;t have a full set of skills are given up  <br/>\non and put in school or special programs to be taught to read? Of  <br/>\ncourse that&#39;s possible.

We&#39;re familiar with the  <br/>\nprocess of absorbing massive amounts of information through books. We  <br/>\ncan easily imagine information that would be very difficult to absorb  <br/>\nany other way.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if society tomorrow dropped reading and turned to hands on  <br/>\nlearning or visual learning, we&#39;d be much better at seeing the ways  <br/>\nreading is limited. That doesn&#39;t mean that books aren&#39;t best in some  <br/>\nsituations. But we&#39;ve put reading on such a pedestal that we elevate  <br/>\nthe skills we can learn through reading and look down on the skills  <br/>\nwe learn other ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the biggest limitation of information gathered through  <br/>\nreading is that the reader experiences the connections made by and  <br/>\npassed on by the writer. While we&#39;ll absorb some of those connections  <br/>\nand we&#39;ll make some connections the writer may have missed, it&#39;s not  <br/>\nhow we&#39;re naturally hardwired to learn. We&#39;re hardwired to learn by  <br/>\npulling our own order from chaos, refining our understanding, testing  <br/>\nit out, using it, refining it further. (How babies pull a mastery of  <br/>\nlanguage out of the chaos of noise interacting with and swirling  <br/>\naround them.) We don&#39;t *naturally* learn by taking in chunks of other  <br/>\npeople&#39;s information. While some people seem to be able to learn that  <br/>\nway, it isn&#39;t what&#39;s natural and it&#39;s very difficult for many people.<br/>\n<br/>\n From the lowest organism that can learn from experience to the  <br/>\nhighest order organisms, we all learn by pulling order from chaos.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s how we evolved to learn. We can watch others and learn, but we  <br/>\ndon&#39;t truly learn until we&#39;re doing something for our own personally  <br/>\nmeaningful reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning Spanish from a book and an instructor will fail miserably  <br/>\nfor most people. And yet kids pick a language up effortlessly when  <br/>\nimmersed in it. (As do adults who trust the process.) Hair dressing.  <br/>\nSwimming. Auto repair. Sewing. Skiing. Painting. Brain surgery.  <br/>\nRocket science. Pool playing. Horse racing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile reading could add to the knowledge, we&#39;re doing a disservice to  <br/>\nother more natural ways of learning when we barely notice their  <br/>\ncontribution. Watching a video will also add knowledge. As does  <br/>\ntalking to people. Each has their strengths and can all enhance the  <br/>\nlearning. But where we build the foundation, though, is in hands on  <br/>\ndoing and trying and thinking and talking and redoing and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a big problem is that testing is easiest to do on knowledge  <br/>\ngained through reading. It&#39;s hard to test how effectively people are  <br/>\nbuilding their own connections. But with reading, we can more easily  <br/>\ndesign tests to show how much someone has absorbed of the (basically)  <br/>\npredigested material.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that make learning from reading superior? No, it makes learning  <br/>\nfrom reading easily testable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don�t know if reading is inevitable, I�ve seen families where  <br/>\n&gt; everyone loves to read and learned to read easily and then one  <br/>\n&gt; child desperately wants to read to but doesn�t seem to be able to  <br/>\n&gt; do so. Then we do work with them, primarily in the area of phonemic  <br/>\n&gt; awareness and literally rewire their brain and they take off.  It�s  <br/>\n&gt; amazing and if I had not been a part of it myself I would still  <br/>\n&gt; think as you do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>At what age is it decided -- by the children or others -- that these  <br/>\nchildren you work with can&#39;t read? What pressures do the children  <br/>\nfeel about reading? No matter how gentle the school program, once a  <br/>\nchild is getting close to 4th grade they can&#39;t miss the messages that  <br/>\nthey aren&#39;t doing what *seemingly* everyone else can.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Yes, an occasional unschooled child can have a passion to read  <br/>\nbefore they&#39;re ready. It&#39;s not all school created. But some kids have  <br/>\na passion to ride a bike before they&#39;re ready. As far as I know, the  <br/>\nkids whose mothers spoke up and asked about how to help their  <br/>\nchildren, have all had their kids read when the kids were ready. It  <br/>\nwas frustratingly not when the kids wanted to be ready, but they did  <br/>\nread.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband at 49 is learning to swim. While he had lessons as a  <br/>\nchild, things that other kids were picking up from play and  <br/>\ninstruction and trying things out and watching others, didn&#39;t make  <br/>\nthe right kind of connections for him. He didn&#39;t learn how to stroke  <br/>\nand breath. He picked up a bad set of skills. Now he&#39;s rewiring his  <br/>\nbrain. (I on the other hand, had no lessons and can stroke and breath  <br/>\njust fine from natural learning.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, are the kids you&#39;re working with naturally wired poorly for  <br/>\nreading, or was the unnatural process of learning to read in school  <br/>\nforcing their brains to make wrong connections in order to perform in  <br/>\nways they couldn&#39;t yet do because their brains weren&#39;t ready?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I�m not real sure why I�m writing except that I think it could be  <br/>\n&gt; interesting to have a �conversation� about all of this.

But what we do know --  <br/>\nthat later onset of reading is perfectly natural in humans --  <br/>\n*suggests* that reading is natural for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Fwd: Unschooling and reading","postDate":"1233566281","msgId":41664,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY4MTk0Mzg2LTRGMEItNEQwQS1CM0Q2LUZGMEU1MTVBNzkxNkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwMjYwMWM5ODRhNSRiMGUzMzNjMCRkMzAxYThjMEBkZWxsbGFwPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":41665,"prevInTime":41663,"nextInTime":41665,"topicId":41664,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I recieved this off list and got permission to post it.

They are now college graduates and  <br/>\n&gt; on their own doing very well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just recently quit a job (I�m doing freelance writing now) where  <br/>\n&gt; I worked for 8 years teaching reading, spelling, comprehension and  <br/>\n&gt; math in a private center. During this time, I had constant doubts  <br/>\n&gt; and issues about reading and how one learns to read and if it  <br/>\n&gt; really is natural, etc.  I always thought reading was a natural  <br/>\n&gt; process but I learned a lot at this job that made me wonder whether  <br/>\n&gt; or not I was right about that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just read some of your articles on your site, http:// <br/>\n&gt; joyfullyrejoycing.com/ on reading and found them very interesting  <br/>\n&gt; and hit upon a lot of things I have wondered about for the last 8  <br/>\n&gt; years, taking into consideration my personal experience with my two  <br/>\n&gt; kids and then with the many, many kids I taught at the center.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In the back of my mind, I thought some of those kids I worked with  <br/>\n&gt; might be fine and their only problem was that they were dealing  <br/>\n&gt; with schools and their artificial guidelines about what needs to be  <br/>\n&gt; taught when, etc.  Yet, I also became aware of some very  <br/>\n&gt; interesting research into the brain and learned through teaching  <br/>\n&gt; that there are indeed some differences with reading and it may not  <br/>\n&gt; always be so natural for some kids.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Those in reading research point out that speech and language have  <br/>\n&gt; been hard wired into us for extremely long evolutionary time but  <br/>\n&gt; reading and spelling are quite young skills and so it�s not so easy  <br/>\n&gt; to compare them with each other.  There are real man-made  <br/>\n&gt; situations involved in decoding our language into symbols on a page  <br/>\n&gt; and there do appear to be some people whose brains are not wired to  <br/>\n&gt; make this an easy task.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For years, I have wished there could be some research done on  <br/>\n&gt; unschoolers and their reading progress. I�d love to see if they  <br/>\n&gt; start out with the same areas of the brain not quite wired up well  <br/>\n&gt; and whether or not they connect naturally as they age.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What I think most unschoolers have as an advantage is families who  <br/>\n&gt; make sure they learn whether or not they are reading, but there is  <br/>\n&gt; also no doubt in my mind that someone who can read at a younger  <br/>\n&gt; age, and enjoys it, can gain so much more information and knowledge  <br/>\n&gt; and be far ahead of a counterpart who is not gaining that knowledge.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don�t know if reading is inevitable, I�ve seen families where  <br/>\n&gt; everyone loves to read and learned to read easily and then one  <br/>\n&gt; child desperately wants to read to but doesn�t seem to be able to  <br/>\n&gt; do so. Then we do work with them, primarily in the area of phonemic  <br/>\n&gt; awareness and literally rewire their brain and they take off.  It�s  <br/>\n&gt; amazing and if I had not been a part of it myself I would still  <br/>\n&gt; think as you do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I�m not real sure why I�m writing except that I think it could be  <br/>\n&gt; interesting to have a �conversation� about all of this. Do you have  <br/>\n&gt; any research you can lead me to that would be helpful to me?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for listening.
