I&#39;m hoping TG will <br/>\ngive me a little scare.  However, Jonathan had the same reaction to the <br/>\ncommercials.  He hid his face and covered his ears.

A family sat in front of us in the theatre, a young man<br/>\nand woman and a 2 1/2, maybe 3 yo boy. It completely spoiled the movie for<br/>\nus because the child was so incredibly freaked out and the parents laughed.<br/>\nI told them their child was really struggling, and I thought he needed to<br/>\nget some relief and would they please take him out. They told me to mind my<br/>\nown business.  What to do in a situation like that? I asked the management<br/>\nabout it and they said parents can do whatever they want, even if the child<br/>\nis that young and in distress.

They have seen  all <br/>\nkinds of stuff, and still as teens will choose Alladin or Follow That Bird  as <br/>\nfreely as Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back or Fight Club.  Holly&#39;s  favorite <br/>\nmovie is still Stand By Me, but she&#39;ll watch Between the Lions and  Dragontales <br/>\nand then listen to Stephen Lynch.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe other night Kirby, Marty and I went to the dollar theater to see  <br/>\nAlexander.  A family in front of us was hesitant about some ticket, and I  think it <br/>\nwas Alexander.  They had a three year old girl with them but it  was already <br/>\n7:45.  I think they had a time consideration.  So we  waited, thinking they <br/>\nwould go to A Shark Tale or something.  They asked  about The Grudge, then.<br/>\n <br/>\nMarty and I turned and looked at each other with such big eyes we didn&#39;t  <br/>\nreally hear what they bought after all, but they did to in, with this little  <br/>\ngirl, whom I hope was going to have a nice nap in dad&#39;s lap in a dark  place.<br/>\n <br/>\nThough I didn&#39;t mind my kids watching R rated stuff, I would never ever  have <br/>\ntaken them to a theater where they couldn&#39;t escape it.  Watching a few  <br/>\nminutes of something in one&#39;s own home is NOT like stuck in the dark with  speakers <br/>\nall around you and overwhelming giant images in the company of  frightened <br/>\nadults.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd so, kind of, with Halo II.  They&#39;re just at home, not on some  foreign <br/>\nbattle field.  No one is shooting at them.  Any second that  they&#39;d rather be <br/>\ndoing something else, they can switch the whole shebang off and  play it later <br/>\nor never again.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21725,"nextTopicId":21748}}
