He&#39;s now in Tasmania and planning to stay a couple weeks in <br/>\nHobart, which is down south. He called last night, in fact, and said <br/>\nthat he had been driving in a brutal rain storm the night before and the <br/>\ncar had gone out of control, spinning one-and-a-half times around and <br/>\nlanding in a ditch! One of the those I want to know about AFTER it&#39;s <br/>\nhappened and I know he&#39;s safe!<br/>\n<br/>\nUnder that heading, we came home a couple nights ago to find the kitchen <br/>\nceiling raining! Water was just POURING out of the recessed lights--all <br/>\nover the kitchen island, the (hardwood) floors, the counters, etc., <br/>\netc., etc. My daughter&#39;s boyfriend (manfriend) leaped onto the island <br/>\nand pulled out the recessed lights, dumping the stored-up water <br/>\nout--something I wouldn&#39;t have thought to do, bless his heart. An <br/>\noverflowing toilet upstairs caused the problem. My other daughter was in <br/>\nthe basement and didn&#39;t do anything &#39;cause she thought it was raining <br/>\noutside!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I&#39;m dealing with insurance estimators and contractors and what-all. <br/>\nI&#39;m not telling Eric about this until it&#39;s all been taken care of, since <br/>\nhe can&#39;t do anything from 10,000 miles away. He&#39;ll come home to a <br/>\nstronger, more independent wife, that&#39;s for sure!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, one other thing--we turned onto our street last night and saw a <br/>\npolice car at the neighbor&#39;s house. I pulled up in front of our house <br/>\nand realized that our neighbor and a policeman were heading toward us <br/>\nwith really concerned looks on their faces. I assumed we had been <br/>\nburgled (spell check didn&#39;t have anything to say about that!) or <br/>\nsomething, but what they told us was that our dog had been outside <br/>\n(about 20 degrees and snowing here last night) for hours and wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nlet anyone come near her! Poor little baby cockapoo. Apparently my <br/>\ndaughter had let her out and forgotten to let her in. It&#39;s illegal to <br/>\nhave dogs loose here--a policy I totally agree with--but we let ours out <br/>\nin back and she pees (spellcheck did get that one-?!) and comes right <br/>\nback in with use watching the whole time. The poor thing was cold and <br/>\nthirsty and terrified and just yelped and yelped when she saw us. After <br/>\ndetermining that we aren&#39;t deadbeats, the police guy left, but I thought <br/>\nour neighbors acted a little strange (after all, they had been cajoling <br/>\nour dog for hours before calling for help). I&#39;m going to make soup and <br/>\nbake cookies for them today.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess all&#39;s well that end&#39;s well! And NO one will EVER forget about <br/>\nthe dog again!<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5673,"nextTopicId":5680}}
