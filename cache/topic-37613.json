I know!  I have great difficulty balancing the needs of <br/>\neveryone in my family.  My son has a best friend who lives almost an <br/>\nhour away.  It&#39;s not really the distance that makes the difference, <br/>\nbut rather how I can fit that activity in the family schedule.  And <br/>\nyes, I know realize I wasn&#39;t opening myself to new activities that I <br/>\nsaw happening more than an hour away from my home.  And of course now <br/>\nmy job hours are going to interfere with the freedom of having the <br/>\nwhole day open.

Not only working <br/>\noutside the home, I am still the transportation provider for most of <br/>\nthe kids activities.  My dd16 isn&#39;t a driver yet because she doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to be and I don&#39;t want to rush her.  My working hours have me <br/>\ngetting home after 6:30pm and it&#39;s not been easy.  But I&#39;m changing <br/>\nthose hours to be more flexible.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started working because I wanted to pursue something that is really <br/>\ndear to my heart.  I don&#39;t have alot of interests as I tend to have a <br/>\nmore narrow focus for my energies.  My son Jeffrey takes after me in <br/>\nthat respect.  I&#39;ve been very bored at home, just laying on the sofa <br/>\nwatching tv and playing on my laptop or reading books.  I absolutely <br/>\nlove little children.  I love singing kid songs and playing kid <br/>\ngames.  I love Dora the Explorer and Barney.  I love the alphabet and <br/>\nsimple counting, building block towers, playing with kitchen toys, <br/>\ncrawling on my hands and knees as pretend animals, and just generally <br/>\nbeing immersed in a young child&#39;s world.  I got a job in a one-year <br/>\nold room at a childcare center and I&#39;ve loved it!  But I&#39;ve also felt <br/>\nguilty because I felt like I was putting my needs above my family&#39;s <br/>\nneeds.  My family has been supportive and thankfully the center is <br/>\nalso helpful in finding a work schedule that will be a happy <br/>\ncompromise for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sometimes kids need us to help them over some kind of &quot;hump&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; that is looking insurmountable to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s exactly what I&#39;ve been trying to do.  I believe she sees <br/>\nschool as her only possibility right now.  By yesterday afternoon, <br/>\nshe reached a point where she was no longer listening to my <br/>\nsuggestions and told me I wasn&#39;t being supportive of her desire to go <br/>\nback into school.  So I made an appt. for Wed. morning to complete <br/>\nthe paperwork to get her back into school.  She&#39;ll start Thursday <br/>\nmorning.  My DH and I have talked and have a clear understanding that <br/>\nshe will stay as long as she wants to stay and knows she can come <br/>\nhome at any time.  My DH is the kind of person who feels that once a <br/>\ndecision like this is made, the person ought to stick it out.  So I <br/>\nfelt like I better be very clear that I wasn&#39;t going to go into this <br/>\nwith that attitude.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Allie is very excited about school.  She went through her closet <br/>\nyesterday to see what clothes she can wear and has made a list of <br/>\nthings she&#39;d like to purchase this weekend.  She&#39;s set her alarm <br/>\nclock for this morning so she can begin waking up earlier each day.  <br/>\nI guess there&#39;s still a part of me that is hoping she&#39;ll change her <br/>\nmind by Thursday.  But I will be positive and supportive of her <br/>\nchoice and help her as she needs me, like I do with anything else she <br/>\nshows an interest in doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: dd10 extremely lonely and bored.","postDate":"1220055077","msgId":37651,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFERDAyQjU0LTNDNTEtNERDOC1CMENELUM2Mzk4NUIxMzJFRkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEExQzc3RjlDLUYwQjEtNDBGRS1BNEYxLTMzRjY3RDg4ODdGRUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGc5OWszcStydWx0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8QTFDNzdGOUMtRjBCMS00MEZFLUE0RjEtMzNGNjdEODg4N0ZFQHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":37649,"nextInTopic":37659,"prevInTime":37650,"nextInTime":37652,"topicId":37613,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-My point is that it isn t a game.
