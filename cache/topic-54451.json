Whether or not he has one, won&#39;t help him learn to read.  Acknowledging that all kids learn differently and at different rates for different reasons can put it in a different light.  For whatever reason &quot;his&quot; brain isn&#39;t yet able to fully read yet.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***He has not picked up much in terms of letters and words and is not making any progress with reading***<br/>\n<br/>\nI always wonder how a parent could possibly know that.  So much of what kids learn and do, is internal.  Leaps and bounds could be happening without a parent or anyone else even realizing it&#39;s happening.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were a couple of things that helped my later reader.  We listened to LOTS of books on tape and CD.  We watched a lot of movies.  She played online role playing games and other video games, and became interested in anime and manga.  All of those things had to do with &quot;reading&quot;.  Stories, plots, comprehension, communicating, following directions, and the final desire of sitting down with a book and reading it.  Manga was a beautiful way to start, lots of pictures, reading from right to left, and fewer words, and it piggy backed onto my daughter&#39;s love of anime.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reading happened when she was ready to read.  It was really that simple.  Her world was full of things she loved and many of those things required some kind of reading.  Until she could read, we helped her.  We played online games together, read together, watched movies together, watched anime together, and played video games together.  We talked about things, I spelled things out for her when she asked.  I gave her free access to the internet to explore whatever she wanted to explore.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s not a huge book reader, she mostly reads online.  She loves books though and does read when the fancy strikes her.  She mostly reads horror or other scary or strange things, and manga which tends toward horror and strange too.  Since part of her process was the collection of words into her memory bank, she also spells almost always perfectly and uses correct grammar and punctuation.  That was part of her visual process of remembering.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat kinds of things does your son like?  What does he do throughout the day?  If you can see where the reading is in those things, you can help it along more.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Learning to read....","postDate":"1274806242","msgId":54454,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRCRkJGRkUyLjEwNzA2MDBAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDUzNjI2OS45NDcxOC5xbUB3ZWI1MjYwOC5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGh0ZmlyZCs0azJkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NTM2MjY5Ljk0NzE4LnFtQHdlYjUyNjA4Lm1haWwucmUyLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":54453,"nextInTopic":54456,"prevInTime":54453,"nextInTime":54455,"topicId":54451,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Ask him what words he wants to be able to read, write them on <br/>\ncards, and keep them in an envelope. Pull them out for him to &quot;practice&quot; <br/>\non and add more. Let them be super weird olr ong words - dinosaur, <br/>\ncroccodile, hydroelectric, or whatever he wants.  Then he can feel like <br/>\nhe can read some super &quot;hard&quot; words.

Because if he likes that, it&#39;s a starting point to do together. But maybe it&#39;s something you already do. <br/>\nMy daughter, who takes a much longer time than my son to learn how to read (despite a great wish to be able to read, a frustrating great wish for her, because most things come much easier), loves comics. I have read mountains of comics to her, sometimes 10 times, as long as she wants and she can read them herself now. She can read small notes I write her, short chapters in books, but she tires quickly. And if she wants I&#39;ll still read to her. <br/>\nIf it&#39;s his clear wish to learn how to read it&#39;s a starting point.<br/>\nJosh <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thuisschool.wordpress.com/\">http://thuisschool.wordpress.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Learning to read....","postDate":"1274790234","msgId":54452,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUzQUY1M0E1LTc5MjYtNDU5Mi05MjVELTA4Qzg2OEJERUJFN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGh0ZmlyZCs0azJkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGh0ZmlyZCs0azJkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54451,"nextInTopic":54453,"prevInTime":54451,"nextInTime":54453,"topicId":54451,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- My younger son is 8 years old and recently taught himself how to read and is making rapid progress-=- I think it will help if you replace taught","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2080225414\">-=- My younger son is 8 years old and recently taught himself how to  <br/>\nread and is making rapid progress-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it will help if you replace &quot;taught himself...&quot; anything with  <br/>\n&quot;learned...&quot; or &quot;figured out how to...&quot;<br/>\nFor unschooling, it will change the angle just a bit, and help you see  <br/>\nnatural learning (rather than any kind of teaching).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-the fact that the little one is starting to read is making the  <br/>\nolder one really upset-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat would have happened even if they were in school.
