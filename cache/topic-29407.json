Because after years of her being SURE<br/>\n&gt;that the other grandkids would turn out better, they did not.  They<br/>\n&gt;got surly and awful and their go-to-church parents separated and<br/>\n&gt;those kids never came to visit them when they weren&#39;t forced to, but<br/>\n&gt;mine go voluntarily and sweetly.  Kirby went when he was 18, and he<br/>\n&gt;had been pretty much excused-for-all-time when he was 15 and she said<br/>\n&gt;none of her boys ever went on family trips once they turned 15.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;She wrote that because she saw the results of what we were doing.<br/>\n&gt;When she told Marty, who was a little guy maybe five or six, that he<br/>\n&gt;couldn&#39;t have any dessert because he didn&#39;t finish his (canned)<br/>\n&gt;vegetables, I pushed my little raisin compote bowl over and said he<br/>\n&gt;could have mine, without a glance at my mother in law.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;She changed her mind and admitted it, which people do here too, if<br/>\n&gt;they stick around long enough.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I cared more about Marty than I did about her.<br/>\n&gt;I care more about the children of those who come to this list than I<br/>\n&gt;care about the moms.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If a mom&#39;s priority is her own feelings and the work it will take for<br/>\n&gt;her to clean up after a visit, that will be an ongoing problem for<br/>\n&gt;her children.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I put my kids&#39; happiness and peace and learning above my own.

They&#39;re healthy,<br/>\n&gt;happy, respected and respectful.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kirby has worked since he was 14 and was offered a job.  He still<br/>\n&gt;lives at home, though others have asked him to move into apartments<br/>\n&gt;with them because they LIKE him.  He&#39;s considering moving to Austin<br/>\n&gt;in August because his job is moving there.  He might or might not,<br/>\n&gt;but we&#39;ve assured him he can try it, learn what it&#39;s like to live<br/>\n&gt;somewhere else, and come home whenever he wants to.  (Other families<br/>\n&gt;we know threw their kids out when they were 18, or started charging<br/>\n&gt;them serious rent, or gave them a choice of military or college,<br/>\n&gt;period.--THAT sounds evil to me.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Marty has worked since he was 14 and was offered a job, but this<br/>\n&gt;summer he&#39;s living on his savings (many thousands of dollars he<br/>\n&gt;didn&#39;t spend while he was working) so he can travel a little, take<br/>\n&gt;his sister to a music festival in another city overnight, do some<br/>\n&gt;camping, and goof around.    Yesterday he went to a movie with<br/>\n&gt;friends, even though he said he would go with me to do something that<br/>\n&gt;evening--a presentation on medieval costume.  He assured me they<br/>\n&gt;would be there, in costume, on time.  They were there, they were<br/>\n&gt;early, they helped arrange the tables and cleaned up afterwards.  Not<br/>\n&gt;many fifteen year olds and their 21 and 22 year old friends will do<br/>\n&gt;that for a mom.  They did it for themselves, though.  They were<br/>\n&gt;interested in the topic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Holly is in Rhode Island visiting another unschooling family.  She<br/>\n&gt;saved her own money from babysitting, bought the ticket and took<br/>\n&gt;spending money.  I was sad to take her to the airport.  She was glad<br/>\n&gt;to go, but was already looking forward to coming back to hang out<br/>\n&gt;with her friend Sierra, and with London and his brother Romeo and<br/>\n&gt;their friend Buddy.  She has plans for 4th of July, and that music<br/>\n&gt;festival, and a medieval campout.  She and Marty are going to Florida<br/>\n&gt;and North Carolina in August.

And getting back to the OP&#39;s request for ideas about<br/>\nkids visiting her house, a shift in perspective can be huge.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was having a similar challenge with a certain friend of my son&#39;s.  My<br/>\nson loves this friend and loves spending time with him, but I was having<br/>\nquite a challenge being with him.  He was rude and could be quite mean.<br/>\nSo I did some pretty extensive personal work on changing my perspective<br/>\nof him and it&#39;s amazing how HE has changed. &lt;g&gt; I really want to<br/>\nappreciate my son&#39;s choices in friends and respect those choices as much<br/>\nas I would respect any other choice or preference.  I also want to be a<br/>\nplace where kids feel comfortable and want to hang.  Recently my mom was<br/>\nwatching my boys and another unschooling friend.  My mom made them pizza<br/>\nfor lunch and this friend said that she didn&#39;t like that pizza.  Being<br/>\nof the old school, my mom said that she was sorry but that&#39;s what she<br/>\nhad made and J could eat it or not, but she wasn&#39;t fixing anything else.<br/>\n(My mom was telling me this story later.)  So J said, &quot;Well, I&#39;m going<br/>\nto see what else is in the kitchen&quot; and proceeded to look through all<br/>\nthe cabinets and fridge.  My mom was taken aback by this bold tactic.<br/>\nShe said to me that she would never have allowed her kids to rummage<br/>\nthrough another person&#39;s cabinets.  I laughed and said that J was<br/>\nwelcome to look through all my cabinets in order to find something to<br/>\neat and that I was glad that she felt that comfortable in my house.  I<br/>\nalso told my mom that there were many times when I was a kid that I<br/>\nhelped myself at friends&#39; houses.  But only in houses where I felt<br/>\nwelcomed and loved.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo maybe if those kids who are being such a challenge had somewhere they<br/>\ncould go where they felt loved and wanted, they&#39;d want to be more<br/>\nrespectful and helpful.  Maybe all they need is a safe haven and your<br/>\nhouse can be it.  It&#39;s amazing what can happen when we just look at<br/>\nkid&#39;s with a different perspective, take them seriously and help them<br/>\nget their needs met.  And in being kind to these kids, your kids get to<br/>\nspend time with friends they enjoy.

Why does everything she  <br/>\ntypes sound so holyier than thou Martha Stewart evil mother in<br/>\nlaw-ish??-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I read comments like these I image that the poster is feeling very<br/>\nover-whelmed with life or with their kids.  I image that the poster<br/>\ncan&#39;t even comprehend that there might be a way to accommodate her kids&#39;<br/>\ndesires and not completely loose herself in the process.  I guess it&#39;s<br/>\nbecause I was once that mom who read these posts and thought how harsh<br/>\n(and unrealistic) they sounded.  The first time I posted (not to this<br/>\nlist, but one with many of the same members) I was pretty overwhelmed<br/>\nand believed that I really needed time to myself (to work) and my son<br/>\nhad decided that he didn&#39;t want to go wherever it was I had arranged for<br/>\nhim to go.  My reason for posting was really about wanting ways to<br/>\nmanipulate him to go without it really looking like I was manipulating<br/>\nhim.  I was very hurt by the responses that questioned that motive and<br/>\nasked how I could work with his needs and keep him with me.  I suspect<br/>\nif I went back and read those posts today I would think there was some<br/>\nreally good advice there.  I think I would see how the posters really<br/>\ncared about my kids and how they knew if I could be generous with them,<br/>\nthat life would indeed get better for all of us.  Being able to read<br/>\nthose posts differently took a shift in consciousness for me.  It was<br/>\nslow and gradual and real.  I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t leave in a huff.  I&#39;m glad<br/>\nI decided that it was more important to try and figure out what these<br/>\nmoms knew.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust recently, my younger son decided that he never wanted to be away<br/>\nfrom me.  This was new for him because he had always been pretty<br/>\nindependent.  However, he suddenly didn&#39;t want to be any place without<br/>\nme.  I never forced him to stay anywhere although this meant rearranging<br/>\nmy schedule many times.  Some of my more conventional friends thought I<br/>\nshould just peel him off of me and drive away.  But I didn&#39;t and I just<br/>\nremembered that this was a season in our life and that at this moment my<br/>\nson had a deep need to be with me.  I knew that he was my first priority<br/>\nand whatever else I had going on could be rescheduled but his immediate<br/>\nneeds could not. It was fascinating watching how he worked it all out<br/>\nfor himself.  First, he&#39;d say that he wanted to go to so and so&#39;s house<br/>\nbut only if I stayed.  Then he&#39;d say that I could leave, but only when<br/>\nhe said I could.  Then he said I could leave, but we needed to hug and<br/>\nkiss and I had to continue waving to him until I was out of sight.  Now<br/>\nmonths later, it&#39;s just a kiss and a hug.  Yesterday, I picked him up<br/>\nfrom a friend&#39;s house where he had spent the past 24 hours.  As we were<br/>\ngetting ready for bed, we were talking about his sleep-over.  I asked<br/>\nhim if he missed me while he was there.  He said, &quot;No, I was having fun<br/>\nand I didn&#39;t think of you at all.&quot;  How sweet it that.  Because he knows<br/>\nthat he gets to choose when he&#39;s away from me and that I&#39;d be there in a<br/>\nsplit second if he needed me, he is able to have such a confident and<br/>\nsecure attitude and completely enjoy being right where he is, with or<br/>\nwithout me.  What a gift and a great way to be in this life!<br/>\n<br/>\nFor this I give much credit to all you Martha Stewart Evil<br/>\nMother-In-Law-ish posters!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nSunday</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Neighbourhood kid problem","postDate":"1182526731","msgId":29431,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFFNDEzMTMyLTExQUEtNDYxQS1BMEFCLUE1MEY5RkY5QUUzOEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNDgwMWM3YjRlMCRlMTAwMGY2MCQ3OTBhMWU0MUB1c2VyZTM4NWNiM2FkMD4=","referencesHeader":"PEJBWTEyOS1GMzdGM0JDMzc4OTM3MjFBOUU3MzUzM0NFMTcwQHBoeC5nYmw+IDwwMDQ4MDFjN2I0ZTAkZTEwMDBmNjAkNzkwYTFlNDFAdXNlcmUzODVjYjNhZDA+"},"prevInTopic":29430,"nextInTopic":29432,"prevInTime":29430,"nextInTime":29432,"topicId":29407,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-But what was wrong with Sandra s responses ? - I thought they were very practical - not way out there in thinking - just bring the dog in and let the kids","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-758151291\">-=-But what was wrong with Sandra&#39;s responses ? - I thought they were  <br/>\nvery practical - not way out there in thinking - just bring the dog  <br/>\nin and let the kids play outside is very simple IMO - not evil at  <br/>\nall.

I do love her dearly - she&#39;s my mom, not perfect (no one is), but my mom anyway !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Then I found out that her new hubby has a cat that they are leaving with one of his son&#39;s because my dear hubby has severe cat allergies.  She said they decided that the cat would be better off with the son because if they took the new cat to her house (which is where they will live) then we could not stay with them when we visit.  They will live in AL and we live in MO. - 16 hours away.    How very kind and considerate.<br/>\n<br/>\nAND my mom and I just got through exchanging emails about school and education - she is admitting for the first time that she thinks our son is getting the best there is - that if she had it to do over she would not send her children to school.

I have found that if I say yes to my children <br/>\nall the time and forget to say yes to what I want or need then I am <br/>\ntoo drained to be a happy mom. I believe the problem lies within <br/>\nsociety. In an ideal society the mom would have much much nore help. <br/>\nShe wouldn&#39;t have to do it all herself. Last night my 18 month old <br/>\nwas up from 1-5am. She was teething. Then my four year old got up at <br/>\n6.30am. We all sleep together. My four year old still nurses once a <br/>\nday in the morning. I just couldn&#39;t do it this morning. My husband <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t help with night time parenting because he has a hard day of <br/>\nwork. I have piles of dishes and I even have a mothers helper this <br/>\nmorning. I still just need to relax. I only have two kids. I can&#39;t <br/>\nimagine what it is like to have more right now. When I can&#39;t nurse my <br/>\nfour year old because I am too wiped out I tell her why and offer her <br/>\na bottle of rice milk and hold her when she cries. When I just can&#39;t <br/>\nsay yes because it is too draining for me physically(I don&#39;t want to <br/>\nexample to them that I give and give and give and never nourish <br/>\nmyself) I offer as many alternatives as I can. If you can afford it a <br/>\nmothers helper can really be a blessing.  I practice getting my <br/>\nchildren involved in finding a solution. They are so smart. You <br/>\nalready told them that you don&#39;t like cleaning up after the neighbors <br/>\nkids. You are exausted and caring for a baby. Maybe ask them what <br/>\nthey think could be a solution. If you don&#39;t like having the <br/>\nneighbors children around and you still want to honor your childrens <br/>\ndesires then maybe a compromise would work. Maybe allow the visitors <br/>\nfor 45 min only?  Or see if you could find other friends with <br/>\nchildren to come over for a visit. Maybe your kids would like to play <br/>\nwith thier kids as well and then there would be another parent around <br/>\nto clean up after their own children.<br/>\nI wish I could send you a mothers helper. Maybe lots of them. I <br/>\nreally think us moms don&#39;t have enough support in this society. <br/>\nDonanne<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jen mobley&quot; &lt;jenpmobley@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; God, does Sandra Dodd even HAVE kids?

Since we moved to this house we have had a  <br/>\n&gt; problem<br/>\n&gt; with the neighbourhood boys (around 5, 7 and 11) that have no  <br/>\n&gt; boundaries and<br/>\n&gt; play out on the street constantly. Our neighbourhood recently had a  <br/>\n&gt; child<br/>\n&gt; abductor around, so it is not safe enough for this. They also  <br/>\n&gt; tormented one<br/>\n&gt; of our dogs (over the fence) to the point that he now tries to bite  <br/>\n&gt; children<br/>\n&gt; he doesn&#39;t know out of fear.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So every day when they finish school they turn up on my doorstep  <br/>\n&gt; (their<br/>\n&gt; mother really has little to do with them) and want to come inside  <br/>\n&gt; and play.<br/>\n&gt; While they are here, things are misused and broken and the house is<br/>\n&gt; completely trashed. I can&#39;t redirect them outside because the dog  <br/>\n&gt; will bite<br/>\n&gt; one of them. I honestly don&#39;t have the energy to clean up after 3  <br/>\n&gt; extra<br/>\n&gt; children, while carrying my baby and tending to the household, kids  <br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; pets. I have even asked the boys to help tidy up before they go but  <br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; just run off. They will stay for hours at a time with no  <br/>\n&gt; consideration for<br/>\n&gt; meal times (sorry, turning into a rant now!).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The problem is that my kids want to play with them. I don&#39;t want to  <br/>\n&gt; say no,<br/>\n&gt; but have because I just can&#39;t face having them over again. I have  <br/>\n&gt; tried to<br/>\n&gt; explain that they create a lot of extra work for me and it&#39;s just  <br/>\n&gt; too much,<br/>\n&gt; but my kids just want to play (I can&#39;t blame them for that).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So what would you do?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Melissa Baker<br/>\n&gt; www.melissabaker.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":288824710,"authorName":"jen mobley","from":"&quot;jen mobley&quot; &lt;jenpmobley@...&gt;","profile":"atomickiss2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Neighbourhood kid problem","postDate":"1182518125","msgId":29420,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTEyOS1GMzdGM0JDMzc4OTM3MjFBOUU3MzUzM0NFMTcwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PDU4QURGM0E4LTU0QzktNDkyMS04MEUxLUIwRjA2QjQzODU3N0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":29410,"nextInTopic":29421,"prevInTime":29419,"nextInTime":29421,"topicId":29407,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"God, does Sandra Dodd even HAVE kids?

I have a question that I would like to hear a radical<br/>\nunschooler&#39;s (or really any) approach on.<br/>\n<br/>\nA little background: I have 3 kids (almost 6, 3 and 10 weeks) and a husband<br/>\nthat travels regularly.  Since we moved to this house we have had a problem<br/>\nwith the neighbourhood boys (around 5, 7 and 11) that have no boundaries and<br/>\nplay out on the street constantly.  Our neighbourhood recently had a child<br/>\nabductor around, so it is not safe enough for this.  They also tormented one<br/>\nof our dogs (over the fence) to the point that he now tries to bite children<br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t know out of fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo every day when they finish school they turn up on my doorstep (their<br/>\nmother really has little to do with them) and want to come inside and play.<br/>\nWhile they are here, things are misused and broken and the house is<br/>\ncompletely trashed.  I can&#39;t redirect them outside because the dog will bite<br/>\none of them.  I honestly don&#39;t have the energy to clean up after 3 extra<br/>\nchildren, while carrying my baby and tending to the household, kids and<br/>\npets.  I have even asked the boys to help tidy up before they go but they<br/>\njust run off.  They will stay for hours at a time with no consideration for<br/>\nmeal times (sorry, turning into a rant now!).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that my kids want to play with them.  I don&#39;t want to say no,<br/>\nbut have because I just can&#39;t face having them over again.  I have tried to<br/>\nexplain that they create a lot of extra work for me and it&#39;s just too much,<br/>\nbut my kids just want to play (I can&#39;t blame them for that).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what would you do?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa Baker<br/>\nwww.melissabaker.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29554,"nextTopicId":29497}}
