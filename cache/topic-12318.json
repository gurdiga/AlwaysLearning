I wonder if you could get your<br/>\nlibrarians to create a policy loophole like that? <br/>\n<br/>\nI want to kick myself for suggesting that some people should get more<br/>\nprivileges at the library than others, but it seems to me that you need<br/>\na higher limit.  (Or need to get more cards for the youngest kids.  But<br/>\nthen you&#39;d probably need a shopping cart to get all the books home.)  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":60629766,"authorName":"heather mclean","from":"heather mclean &lt;heather_200115@...&gt;","profile":"heather_200115","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"[AlwaysLearning] library books","postDate":"1045499869","msgId":12318,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwMjE3MTYzNzQ5LjIwMzQ3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwNzA3Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNDU0NzE2NjAuODMxLjQ5ODkzLm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":12321,"prevInTime":12317,"nextInTime":12319,"topicId":12318,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1708382685\">&lt;&lt; I hear that a lot when I&#39;m in the library.
