There s","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-447055807\">There&#39;s a site called lilaguide.com, &quot;real parents, local advice.&quot;<br/>\nThey&#39;re starting new lists and forums, and I figured I might as well  <br/>\nget in on it.  There&#39;s money involved, because they draw advertising  <br/>\nand have sponsors.  I&#39;ve tried to avoid money (and done too well for  <br/>\nKeith&#39;s preferences, definitely), but this site is worth having a  <br/>\npresence on because it will be lots of people&#39;s first exposure to  <br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone here wants to go and help me introduce unschooling gently  <br/>\nto new people, I&#39;d appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do NOT want it to take away from this list.  This list is my online  <br/>\nhouseparty.  This is the good one.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn lilaguide, if you review products and places (in the select  <br/>\ncities?  Maybe you can add your city?) you earn Target gift cards.   <br/>\nNow this might be absolutely worthless to some of you.  I don&#39;t know  <br/>\nif Target stores even go into Canada.  And the first some (I forget  <br/>\nif it was ten or twenty) who join get a $5 gift certificate to Target  <br/>\n(so if you don&#39;t live near Target, maybe hang back  until tomorrow).   <br/>\nOnce in a while, I get money (probably Target gift cards &lt;bwg&gt;) for  <br/>\nactivity on the list or member count or something.  So I&#39;m selling  <br/>\nout, but for a good cause.  New audience for unschooling, and maybe  <br/>\nthat list will support my (slight but steady) site expenses.  They  <br/>\ndon&#39;t mind us putting links to Joyce&#39;s site or mine; I already asked.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could think of it as missionary work.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the blurb and link from that site, and I&#39;m still learning how  <br/>\nto use their set-up.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling and Parenting Peacefully<br/>\n<br/>\nGroup Owner<br/>\nSandraDodd<br/>\nHow can the joyful learning babies and toddlers do be carried through  <br/>\nto adulthood? It&#39;s possible! This list is for discussing  <br/>\nunschooling&#39;s potential to transform the whole family in wonderful ways.<br/>\nFind our group at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lilaguide.com/groups/unschoolingparents\">http://www.lilaguide.com/groups/unschoolingparents</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35113,"nextTopicId":35188}}
