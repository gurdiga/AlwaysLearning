It seems to be an imaginative and <br/>\ncreative selection of toys. But sorta expensive. They have a web <br/>\nsite: www.museumtour.com. The magazine appears more attractive than <br/>\nthe web site even. They have make your own kites, weaving looms, <br/>\npottery wheels, many electronic toys that you design and build, fun <br/>\nnature kits, etc. Lots of hands on discovery elements to play with.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20921,"nextTopicId":20969}}
