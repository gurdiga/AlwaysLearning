The first couple of times I read at kidsinmind.com I was looking up Disney animated movies.  Reading objective descriptions of scenes that are written in a way so as to avoid too many spoilers can be a bit deceiving.  The scenes sound way worse than they actually are.

We all watched the movie together, pausing it once because he wanted to confirm that it really was based on a true story and he wanted to know how Queen Victoria was related to the king in the movie, and when it was over he said it was &quot;a good movie but it could have used more action.&quot;  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband would also like to watch Die Hard again sometime soon - and it too is rated R.  Just as we did with The King&#39;s Speech, my son and I read through the Content Advisory together - and this time he decided he doesn&#39;t want to watch the movie, as it has too much violence and gore for his taste.

Again, rules are needed for some things but not with others for certain kids.  Violence, would not allow that for some kids I know but swearing is ok with others who know how to keep it separate.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd keep an eye to make sure there are no &quot;hidden&quot; harm going on.  My son is actually the one who set boundaries with Cartoon Network and tells me when someone I don&#39;t allow is on and explain why channels are changed.<br/>\n======= <br/>\n<br/>\nHmm. Well I don&#39;t think this advice is very helpful for moving towards unschooling, even if it does seem to be working for an individual mom in her home. In this case I guess &quot;working&quot; means, Mom feels comfortable and secure. Not that feeling that way is a bad thing, but moving towards unschooling generally means self-questioning and often means a period of inner discomfort, the squirminess of change as it happens. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the fundamental practices in unschooling is living a life that is founded on principles rather than bringing rules, especially arbitrary ones, into the home. The last thing we have ever cared about over here is whether something is rated PG-13.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean that we aren&#39;t aware of the rules and laws that exist in the world - but telling a child that there are rules that he has to follow in the home, that you are defining and choosing, is a step away from unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoundaries are around yourself, your own comfort, not walls to put around someone else. Rather than lay down rules, combined with critical remarks that could be felt as put downs, it is better to help the kids understand where your boundaries are, and how to work with those.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, giving the child information about the principle of Courtesy - that repeating some of these words and phrases in company could offend or alarm people is helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with the headphones idea - Jayn uses them, but it is mostly because she wants a sense of privacy. However the advantage for me is that I don&#39;t have to hear what is actually very repetitive stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn and I used to watch a lot more Family Guy than we do now. In fact I think we have seen almost all episodes. There is generally something to offend someone in every one. Much of it is kinky-sexual, especially in reference to the character Quagmire. Before Jayn understood the mechanisms of sex and intercourse (a conversation she initiated when she was ready) a lot of it went right by her. Sometimes she would ask what something meant, and I would say &quot;that&#39;s a sexual reference&quot; and she would just say &quot;OK&quot; and not want any more information.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of that big talk, she said in a kind of light dawning way, &quot;Is that what Quagmire is always going on about?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nExplaining *why* something is offensive to you (triggers your boundaries), or might likely be offensive to others, is much more helpful than any kind of blanket rule, or age related permission. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is also a lot more difficult, requires a lot more self-examination in preparation for that conversation, and a lot more emotional vulnerability. <br/>\n<br/>\nTalking about PG-13 could set up a situation where the child can hardly wait to be 13 to go hog wild and explore all this forbidden fruit. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a general rule ;) elucidating the problem, and asking the child for ideas of their solution, is far more likely to generate solutions everyone can live with happily, than any kind of top-down dictate.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Our favorite is Paul Soares Jr. (If you haven&#39;t seen his yet, I highly recommend him!) He is very family friendly and even has some videos of him playing with his wife and kids. There are some people that he plays on a server (Minecrack) with that Jake wanted to watch videos from too. They used a lot of cursing on their own videos. Jake will ask me &quot;Momma, what does ______ mean?&quot; and I always explain it. I&#39;ve told him that other people use that language, but his father and I chose not to for ourselves (never actually telling him he can&#39;t). He watches them and learns a LOT from them (especially GenericB who does a lot of redstone work on his videos). <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, my point is this: the less of a deal it is to us, the less of a deal it is to them. The more emphasis we put on it, the more they will. In our house, words are just words. Some we chose to use, some we don&#39;t.

Some have more swearing in than others but that hasn&#39;t really been an issue as he&#39;s aware that swearing is offensive to most people especially from a child. More adult references have tended to just pass him by, or sometimes he&#39;s asked me what they mean and I&#39;ve explained.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At the moment he&#39;s mostly watching a guy called Pewdiepie whose swearing is a lot more frequent and extreme, and there&#39;s also a fair bit of sexual reference and violence.

He says he watches Pewdiepie because he finds him funny and he likes him because he found out how to &#39;favourite&#39; videos from one of his videos. My overriding feeling is that he just ignores/isn&#39;t really aware of the elements that I&#39;m uncomfortable with. Â My husband doesn&#39;t like watching Finn watching this guy at all. We talked about it last night and were thinking that we&#39;d rather Finn continued to be comfortable making that kind of choice with us there, than feeling that a) we were disregarding his interest and b) Â that the only way to watch was behind our backs somehow. I&#39;ve chatted with Finn this morning and explained to him that when Ben gets home from work he&#39;s finding it stressful for Finn to have Pewdiepie on, and Finn&#39;s said he&#39;ll watch in the day and watch/do other things in the evening so Ben&#39;s happier.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m a bit stuck and can&#39;t quite think through this. I obviously want to support him watching something that he&#39;s finding interesting and enjoyable, but the extremity of the things the guy says has thrown me a bit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tam<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":250343173,"authorName":"Tam","from":"Tam &lt;wifejuliefish@...&gt;","profile":"wifejuliefish","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Swearing/sexual content in gaming videos","postDate":"1367258829","msgId":71329,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNjcyNTg4MjkuNDYxOTIuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE3MjEwMy5tYWlsLmlyMi55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PENBS1g5OGZoT3BVcGJrcjF6cE5GVDRuWU5pcjl3aTRWeEw1TWdubUZtZWg1Z1BfXzJ3QUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGtsbDlhbitoa3NkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8MTM2NzI0MDM3My44OTMzNy5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViMTgyMjAyLm1haWwuYmYxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4JPEFGN0U0OTY4LTlCQjgtNEJDMy1CM0EyLUUwQkY1QjYwRUUwOUB5YWhvby5jby51az4gPENBS1g5OGZoT3BVcGJrcjF6cE5GVDRuWU5pcjl3aTRWeEw1TWdubUZtZWg1Z1BfXzJ3QUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":71328,"nextInTopic":71331,"prevInTime":71328,"nextInTime":71330,"topicId":71321,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"==We love Pewdiepie!

I am very interested in responses.  I have the exact same thing in my house.  Except it sounds like your son doesn t swear","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2123140695\">Thank you for posting this!  I am very interested in responses.  I have the exact same thing in my house.  Except it sounds like your son doesn&#39;t swear himself.   I have four kids and all four love to watch YouTube minecraft videos, even my two year old!  <br/>\n<br/>\nSwearing is a very interesting topic for me.  My children have gone through phases where they are fascinated with swear words.  This is a hard one for me because I tend to not give those words power to offend me, though I know that many adults in society do.  I have explained this to all my children so that they understand that if they use swear words, there is a good chance it will upset other parents and even other children.  They all understand it at different levels.  But they all LOVE to use these words at home, and often with friends.  The words DO feel powerful, and certain words are SO offensive to people, especially when used as insults- so I think it feels powerful to mimic phrases they are learning from MC videos.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore YouTube minecraft videos, the kids mainly used &quot;damn!&quot; or &quot;shit&quot; which they picked up from me I think.  The occasional F-word or A-word.  But since Minecraft videos, the language now includes every swear word on earth.  Minecrafters often use the vulgar words for vagina.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy four year old responds similarly to your son.  My husband is also extremely uncomfortable with him watching the videos with swearing.  He (my husband) has asked him to please change the video because the swearing is upsetting him, and G says, Dad, I&#39;ll turn down the volume when he swears, I really need to see this mod, or I can&#39;t turn it off, he&#39;s about to explain how to do something!  Can you go in a different room?   He seems to be unaffected by the swearing, as he is focusing on the content.  Yet he is definitely learning the swear words and how to use them because when he is playing multiplayer, he has sworn at the screen, calling a player a &quot;dick&quot; for being a f****ing hacker, terminology that comes directly from videos.  I do explain to him that when people hear those words coming from a young child they are likely to get very upset.  I have given him a list of okay words to use publicly when expressing shock or frustration, etc.  We love the words used by Captain Haddock in Tintin comic books- billions of blue barnacles!  He often chooses to say oh Fudge!  But he still sometimes does choose to swear.  And it doesn&#39;t bother me because I am just not offended by it.  I do wish he didn&#39;t know the more vulgar words like pus*y because the depth of offensiveness could be worse.  I see my job as to keep him aware when he uses the words and suggest alternatives.  Swearing can become an embarrassing habit.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy older two kids (13,9) actually find the swearing of interest in the videos.  They sometimes laugh out loud at the extreme swearing or creative swearing.  They both understand that using those words offends people.  But they love to use the words among themselves and within certain groups of friends.  I feel an unease about it, and I talk to them about my concerns.  A main concern is that using these words a lot becomes habitual and even though they aim to be private about it, they are sometimes overheard.  Then they need to deal with the consequences- which are that they have offended someone, or that they are creating an image of themselves as &quot;kids who swear&quot; in the neighborhood.  Some children are not allowed to play with certain kids we know who use F-words at the park a lot.  My kids love to gather neighborhood kids for kickball games.  Do they want parents to see them as offensive swearing kids when they come to ask to play ball?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose the main issue with young children hearing older Minecrafters swearing is that it comes out so naturally and starts to seem normal.  Young kids with limited life experience may not have heard enough to even notice that it is different from &quot;acceptable&quot; conversation.  Some kids may be ignoring audio and just soaking in the visual, but if your kid, like mine, is soaking in and mimicking the audio as well- then it is an opportunity for learning about language and choice of words, and being mindful about the words you choose and mindful of your audience.  It has been a big learning experience for my four year old.  He knows which Youtubers swear and which do not.  He also knows that swearing is often against the rules on many servers, including our own server.  He recognizes the spelling of many swear words and moderates others&#39; use by kicking or banning.  He also sometimes types swear words into chats and gets kicked or banned himself.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t what I envisioned when choosing to unschool- that we would spend months on end focused on swear words.  But it is language, playing with language, learning the power of words and power of choice.  A very important and useful topic!<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nAli</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":250343173,"authorName":"Tam","from":"Tam &lt;wifejuliefish@...&gt;","profile":"wifejuliefish","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Swearing/sexual content in gaming videos","postDate":"1367241765","msgId":71326,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFGN0U0OTY4LTlCQjgtNEJDMy1CM0EyLUUwQkY1QjYwRUUwOUB5YWhvby5jby51az4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNjcyNDAzNzMuODkzMzcuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE4MjIwMi5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGtsbDlhbitoa3NkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MTM2NzI0MDM3My44OTMzNy5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViMTgyMjAyLm1haWwuYmYxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":71325,"nextInTopic":71327,"prevInTime":71325,"nextInTime":71327,"topicId":71321,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ah yes he does normally have headphones but they broke, I d forgotten actually, I ll get him some more.

I would cringe or show in some natural way that it seemed nastier or ruder than I was comfortable with, but they knew that it was rude for rude&#39;s sake.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly hangs out with punk rock musucians, and lots of them write comically rude songs.  Really rude, and kind of stupid.  It&#39;s an art unto itself, but none of those guys are the least bit tacky or rude when they&#39;re over for a games night at our house, or when they&#39;re in public places and not performing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think asking him to use headphones, or not to watch it when his dad&#39;s around, isn&#39;t at all a bad thing.  You&#39;re not asking him to be sneaky.  You&#39;re asking him to be courteous.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":250343173,"authorName":"Tam","from":"&quot;Tam&quot; &lt;wifejuliefish@...&gt;","profile":"wifejuliefish","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Swearing/sexual content in gaming videos","postDate":"1367222423","msgId":71321,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtsbDlhbitoa3NkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":71324,"prevInTime":71320,"nextInTime":71324,"topicId":71321,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I m hoping for some perspective on how to handle a situation with some videos my seven year old is watching.

He tends to have a favourite youtuber who he&#39;ll watch almost exclusively for a couple of months and then move on. Some have more swearing in than others but that hasn&#39;t really been an issue as he&#39;s aware that swearing is offensive to most people especially from a child. More adult references have tended to just pass him by, or sometimes he&#39;s asked me what they mean and I&#39;ve explained.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the moment he&#39;s mostly watching a guy called Pewdiepie whose swearing is a lot more frequent and extreme, and there&#39;s also a fair bit of sexual reference and violence. There was some gameplay the other day where the guy was shouting, &quot;I&#39;m hitting her in the vagina!&quot; and then, &quot;I&#39;m f----- her up the a----&quot;. I commented that I thought this was really horrible and could we put something else on, he said to me it&#39;s ok that bit&#39;s gone now.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe watch with him and/or are in the same room when he watches, and he&#39;s always been active in turning something off or coming to us if he&#39;s uncomfortable with it (usually if there&#39;s something he finds too scary like Amnesia), but this doesn&#39;t seem to bother him. He says he watches Pewdiepie because he finds him funny and he likes him because he found out how to &#39;favourite&#39; videos from one of his videos. My overriding feeling is that he just ignores/isn&#39;t really aware of the elements that I&#39;m uncomfortable with. Â My husband doesn&#39;t like watching Finn watching this guy at all. We talked about it last night and were thinking that we&#39;d rather Finn continued to be comfortable making that kind of choice with us there, than feeling that a) we were disregarding his interest and b) Â that the only way to watch was behind our backs somehow. I&#39;ve chatted with Finn this morning and explained to him that when Ben gets home from work he&#39;s finding it stressful for Finn to have Pewdiepie on, and Finn&#39;s said he&#39;ll watch in the day and watch/do other things in the evening so Ben&#39;s happier.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a bit stuck and can&#39;t quite think through this. I obviously want to support him watching something that he&#39;s finding interesting and enjoyable, but the extremity of the things the guy says has thrown me a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nTam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71317,"nextTopicId":71345}}
