It&#39;s very hard to match <br/>\nimages in your brain with reality sometimes.<br/>\nI pictured Mary as this long, dark haired person....kind of asian <br/>\nlooking. She looks a lot like ME!! LOL<br/>\nAnd Joyce I had an older image with dark hair...why do I always <br/>\npicture people with dark hair?<br/>\nIt&#39;s so neat to see the happy smiling faces irl that I chat with here.<br/>\nAnd all those free and joyful kids!!<br/>\nI actually had a similar image of Sharon (of the swamp) in my <br/>\nhead....amazing!
