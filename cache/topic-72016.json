It didn&#39;t seem interesting, I figured it was motivated by a desire to tar and feather an already tarred and feathered medium, but it seemed like it was fine. Also a need to publish. Publishing is so important in academia. And Plos One is an interesting journal. David&#39;s just submitted a paper there. They don&#39;t look at the theory, they don&#39;t examine the ideas, the editors are only interested in the analysis. It is an interesting editorial decision. <br/>\n<br/>\nI noted, as Deb notes, the questions about loneliness and state of mind might lead someone to feel lonely, to say yes it hurts there, if they hadn&#39;t already thought about it. David looked at it and said they are all 19, or so. They are all mostly using Facebook to meet up with friends. That might be what is the really telling thing. That 19 year olds who are looking for stuff to do and people to do it with may be looking for more things to do and more people to do it with when they&#39;ve upped their time on facebook. That their purpose for facebook is really what being examined and not the using of facebook.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is the finding? It&#39;s a vague association between more facebook use and depression. They tried to pin down directionality, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as easy to do as they suggest. In the end what can one say when asked about this study, among social 19 year olds, using facebook to connect with other people, there seems to be an association between increased time on facebook and depression, whether the facebook use is a symptom or a cause is very clearly not demonstrated. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n From: Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: Always Learning &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; <br/>\nSent: Sunday, 25 August 2013, 22:12<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Studies, and reading studies, and &quot;research&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a short piece of writing to discuss,<br/>\n but it&#39;s a sample to illustrate other, recent, similar things.   I&#39;m hoping Pam Sorooshian (when she&#39;s back from Massachusetts) and Schuyler Waynforth (who is good at these things), and Joyce and Deb and anyone else who&#39;s logical and interested in logic and design, could comment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPartly this is a problem of internet blogs and sites that want traffic to come to them because they have advertisements.  That&#39;s been true of newpapers, TV, radio, magazines....   But that&#39;s a minor part.<br/>\n<br/>\nPartly this is a problem of headlines/titles, which are traditionally (in newspaper and magazine tradition) created by editors who might or might not have read the article carefully; who might or might not intend to be honest (rather than sensational) even if they have.<br/>\n<br/>\nPartly I bring this because sometimes unschooling parents are tired from having young chidlren around all day and night, and pressured by friends and relatives to<br/>\n explain, produce, impress, justify.  It makes them jittery, sometimes.  Nervous.  Reactionary.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuick, short &quot;reports&quot; on &quot;research&quot; sometimes say things that seen Definite and Important, when looking at the &quot;study&quot; itself shows something very small and flimsy.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/08/19/213568763/researchers-facebook-makes-us-sadder-and-less-satisfied\">http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/08/19/213568763/researchers-facebook-makes-us-sadder-and-less-satisfied</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t want to read it there, here&#39;s the text (easier for cutting and pasting, too).  I&#39;ll comment in a response post.<br/>\n<br/>\n___________________<br/>\n<br/>\nFacebook Makes Us Sadder And Less Satisfied, Study Finds<br/>\n<br/>\nby ELISE HU<br/>\nAugust 20, 201310:35 AM<br/>\n<br/>\nFacebook&#39;s mission &quot;to make the world more open and connected&quot; is a familiar refrain among company leaders. But the<br/>\n latest research shows connecting 1.1 billion users around the world may come at a psychological cost.<br/>\n<br/>\nA new University of Michigan study on college-aged adults finds that the more they used Facebook, the worse they felt. The study, published in the journal PLOS One, found Facebook use led to declines in moment-to-moment happiness and overall life satisfaction.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;There&#39;s a huge amount of interest ... because Facebook is so widespread,&quot; says research co-author John Jonides, a University of Michigan cognitive neuroscientist. &quot;With something like half a billion people who use Facebook every day, understanding the consequences of that use on our well being is of critical importance.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nResearchers tested the variables of happiness and satisfaction in real time on 82 participants. The researchers text-messaged them five times a day for two weeks to examine how Facebook use influenced how they felt. Participants responded to questions about<br/>\n loneliness, anxiety and general emotional well-being.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe study authors did not get at the reasons Facebook made their test subjects feel glum. But Jonides suspects it may have to do with social comparison.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;When you&#39;re on a site like Facebook, you get lots of posts about what people are doing. That sets up social comparison — you maybe feel your life is not as full and rich as those people you see on Facebook,&quot; he says.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, Jonides notes, the study found the effects of Facebook are most pronounced for those who socialize the most &quot;in real life.&quot; He says the folks who did the most direct, face-to-face socializing and used social media were the ones who reported the most Facebook-related mood decline.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It suggests that when you are engaging in social interactions a lot, you&#39;re more aware of what others are doing and, consequently, you might be more sensitized about what&#39;s happening on Facebook and comparing that<br/>\n to your own life,&quot; Jonides says.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe researchers also tested and discounted other reasons for our unhappiness. The University of Michigan notes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;[Researchers] also found no evidence for two alternative possible explanations for the finding that Facebook undermines happiness. People were not more likely to use Facebook when they felt bad. In addition, although people were more likely to use Facebook when they were lonely, loneliness and Facebook use both independently predicted how happy participants subsequently felt. &#39;Thus, it was not the case that Facebook use served as a proxy for feeling bad or lonely,&#39; says [lead author Ethan] Kross.&quot;<br/>\nWe reached out to Facebook for a response, but got an automatic reply. These findings, however, add data points in our quest to understand Facebook and other social media&#39;s effect on our emotional well-being, whether it&#39;s the behemoth social network&#39;s role after relationships end or our feelings of<br/>\n regret after pressing &quot;share.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re feeling bummed, researchers did test for and find a solution. The prescription for Facebook despair is less Facebook. Researchers found that face-to-face or phone interaction — those outmoded, analog ways of communication — had the opposite effect.

But the latest research shows connecting 1.1 billion users around the world may come at a psychological cost.<br/>\n<br/>\nA new University of Michigan study on college-aged adults finds that the more they used Facebook, the worse they felt. The study, published in the journal PLOS One, found Facebook use led to declines in moment-to-moment happiness and overall life satisfaction.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;There&#39;s a huge amount of interest ... because Facebook is so widespread,&quot; says research co-author John Jonides, a University of Michigan cognitive neuroscientist. &quot;With something like half a billion people who use Facebook every day, understanding the consequences of that use on our well being is of critical importance.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nResearchers tested the variables of happiness and satisfaction in real time on 82 participants. The researchers text-messaged them five times a day for two weeks to examine how Facebook use influenced how they felt. Participants responded to questions about loneliness, anxiety and general emotional well-being.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe study authors did not get at the reasons Facebook made their test subjects feel glum. But Jonides suspects it may have to do with social comparison.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;When you&#39;re on a site like Facebook, you get lots of posts about what people are doing. That sets up social comparison — you maybe feel your life is not as full and rich as those people you see on Facebook,&quot; he says.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, Jonides notes, the study found the effects of Facebook are most pronounced for those who socialize the most &quot;in real life.&quot; He says the folks who did the most direct, face-to-face socializing and used social media were the ones who reported the most Facebook-related mood decline.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It suggests that when you are engaging in social interactions a lot, you&#39;re more aware of what others are doing and, consequently, you might be more sensitized about what&#39;s happening on Facebook and comparing that to your own life,&quot; Jonides says.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe researchers also tested and discounted other reasons for our unhappiness. The University of Michigan notes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;[Researchers] also found no evidence for two alternative possible explanations for the finding that Facebook undermines happiness. People were not more likely to use Facebook when they felt bad. In addition, although people were more likely to use Facebook when they were lonely, loneliness and Facebook use both independently predicted how happy participants subsequently felt. &#39;Thus, it was not the case that Facebook use served as a proxy for feeling bad or lonely,&#39; says [lead author Ethan] Kross.&quot;<br/>\nWe reached out to Facebook for a response, but got an automatic reply. These findings, however, add data points in our quest to understand Facebook and other social media&#39;s effect on our emotional well-being, whether it&#39;s the behemoth social network&#39;s role after relationships end or our feelings of regret after pressing &quot;share.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re feeling bummed, researchers did test for and find a solution. The prescription for Facebook despair is less Facebook. Researchers found that face-to-face or phone interaction — those outmoded, analog ways of communication — had the opposite effect. Direct interactions with other human beings led people to feel better.<br/>\n<br/>\nRead the full study at PLOS One.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0069841#s2\">http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0069841#s2</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/08/19/213568763/researchers-facebook-makes-us-sadder-and-less-satisfied\">http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/08/19/213568763/researchers-facebook-makes-us-sadder-and-less-satisfied</a><br/>\nAt that link, you can read more about the professor, John Jonides.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly that one person was named.
