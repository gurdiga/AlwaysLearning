Anyway, &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird is a good book&quot; is a complete matter of opinion.  Forcing kids to read it and teaching them what they should abstractly think about it because they are not able to think abstractly yet 1)takes away their opportunity to think and form their own opinions (which is what really can help build brain connections) and 2)really doesn&#39;t sound possible or logical....<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s all I&#39;m going to take time to write, but look forward to your analysis of the article, Sandra.

I was captivated. It was a couple years before I read the book - not for school, but for my own pleasure, and I remember being very aware that I had a whole different perspective after reading it. Generally speaking, I have a much better appreciation for books I read on my own than those I read for school. I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t read that book for school until I&#39;d already enjoyed it elsewhere or I might never really have a grasp of what makes it Such a good book. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been watching some old Dr Who episodes recently at home, with Morgan, and yesterday she came up to me with a book of hers - a graphic novel - and pointed out that there was a character who shared a name with one of the planets Dr Who had just visited. She&#39;s good at pulling out references like that (and cheesy sci-fi like Dr Who is Full of lierary references). She doesn&#39;t need someone to tell her why a book or show or movie is good. She knows what she likes And she knows when things are well written, well plotted, have good characters and interesting themes. It&#39;s not something that needs to be taught. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Outsiders&#39; views of unschooling","postDate":"1312387403","msgId":62181,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBCQUU1NjM2LUVEOTYtNDdGNi1CQ0Y4LTZGM0ZBM0FEMTE0QUBTYW5kcmFEb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":62184,"prevInTime":62180,"nextInTime":62182,"topicId":62181,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is a quote from a child psychologist and Harvard medical professor, in response to a reporter s questions about unschooling.
