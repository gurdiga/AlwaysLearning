She&#39;s 10 and ahalf. No budding, no body odour.<br/>\n&gt;Nothing. <br/>\n&gt;She&#39;s been like this since birth any way.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;No idea why vampires either, and not say, werewolves<br/>\n&gt;or bogey-men.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think you are on to something there Shyrley.  You<br/>\nsaid she had sex obsessiveness before, she is<br/>\nincredibly precocious, is not yet having her cycles<br/>\nand is terrified of vampires.  Vampires are very SEXY<br/>\n&quot;monsters.&quot;  Just look at all the erotic vampire<br/>\nfiction, the movies, the sensual qualities.  There is<br/>\nsomething so intimate and dangerous and seductive<br/>\nabout the whole vampire mythos.  Even the drinking of<br/>\nblood is this intimate exchange that is often equated<br/>\nwith an orgasmic experience by those who make the<br/>\nmovies and write the stories.  Male vampires bite<br/>\nwomen, female vampires bite men.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps her fears are stemming from secret desires or<br/>\nlongings to be sought out in that manner, to be found<br/>\ndesirable by a vampire, which fascinates, and<br/>\nterrifies her at the same time?  Perhaps all of this<br/>\nhas to do with feeling that her body SHOULD be more<br/>\nmature to match her mind, and she is anxious about<br/>\nthat.  Perhaps there are also hormones in play here,<br/>\nalthough there are no physical signs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t start my cycle until I was 13, so I<br/>\nsympathise with her.  Maybe she needs some fiction<br/>\nwith a little romance in it to occupy her mind? <br/>\nPerhaps some books designed for teens or young adults?<br/>\n How far you want the fiction to go in terms of sexual<br/>\nexplicitness is a parental decision of course.  But at<br/>\nher age I was reading things like &quot;Friday&quot; and the<br/>\nEarth&#39;s Children series by Jean M. Auel, which are<br/>\nheavily sexually explicit.  It didn&#39;t confuse, twist<br/>\nor damage me.  On the contrary, it answered the<br/>\nquestions my parents wouldn&#39;t and gave me a knowledge<br/>\nbase that made me confident in my own sexual identity<br/>\nas an adult.  I knew what was what, so I was not<br/>\nafraid or defenseless.  Both books have rape in them,<br/>\nso you might want to find something a bit more<br/>\nromantic and happy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne that doesn&#39;t have sex in it, but is a love story<br/>\nwhich I enjoyed reading recently, is &quot;The Hob&#39;s<br/>\nBargain&quot; by Patricia Briggs.  It&#39;s a fantasy story<br/>\nwith magic and a female heroine.  Another fantasy love<br/>\nstory with a female heroine  is &quot;Once Upon a Winter&#39;s<br/>\nNight&quot; by Dennis L. McKiernan.  It&#39;s a retelling of a<br/>\nclassic Frog Prince style fairy tale which is really<br/>\ngood.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, just a thought I had based on the information<br/>\ngiven.  Good luck with your daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n(By the way, I will be posting a note today about how<br/>\nmy hubby is doing.)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10616,"nextTopicId":10624}}
