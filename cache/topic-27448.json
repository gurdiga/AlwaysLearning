I had picked something for having a  <br/>\nsmall range and being in 4/4 time.  What I didn&#39;t notice was that it  <br/>\nwas in the key of G (so there were F sharps).<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was fine.  I drew a diagonal pencil line through each F and he  <br/>\nwent for it.

And  <br/>\nthen it was one he got doubly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t matter that he did that when he was 20 instead of when he  <br/>\nwas five or ten years old.

Its author is, like many others, a member of the public school community (the publication is national, but based here in MD).  The fact that she showed a real interest and a want to understand what u/s&#39;ing is touched me.  She said that she began to reflect on her own educational experiences and how she wants her children to learn, etc. as she did her research and as she spoke with me (hers are small as well).  She also said that unschooling made sense to her.  Maybe the kind path here is to see that this article may have set one person along the path to question a life with greater freedom for their children.  The photographer who came to our home was also moved by what she saw here.  She doesn&#39;t have small people, but you could tell what she saw got her<br/>\n thinking.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Imo, the taped interview with me is a much better reflection of unschooling (or so I hope).  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I was **floored** by Mr. Smith&#39;s remarks.

It was also her addition to mention that &quot;the tribe&quot; calculates tips at restaurants.  We frequent joints that ask if you&#39;d like a combo or fries with that.  Restaurants don&#39;t fit us.

I&#39;m not sure who, but you are down <br/>\nto 2 now. Kirby is still there, taking his math class at TVI, but either <br/>\nHolly or Marty have disappeared. I&#39;m really sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlfie Kohn concludes by saying: &quot;there&#39;s no question that unschooling leaves <br/>\nbehind most of the bad stuff in a lot of schools. The question is whether <br/>\nsome good stuff or potential good stuff is missing.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of course the answer is yes, potential good stuff is missing. But that&#39;s <br/>\nokay, potential good stuff is missing from everybody&#39;s life. It is a funny <br/>\nnotion that any educational philosophy, or any life approach, should lead to <br/>\na life inclusive of everything. But, I suppose, if that is the worst thing <br/>\nin the article, that and the horrible disappearance of one of your <br/>\nchildren...<br/>\n<br/>\nActually it starts off in the way all of these articles tend to start off, <br/>\nwith a normal school morning being described and a family not rising for the <br/>\nbus. And moving into a day without teachers and students but one described <br/>\nas following the &quot;philosophy of letting the child decide each day what <br/>\nactivities to pursue-or avoid.&quot; Even if it is apt, it isn&#39;t how I would <br/>\ndescribe our lives or my philosophical approach to life. It hasn&#39;t any of <br/>\nthe beauty or the wonder that I associate with unschooling. Maybe that is <br/>\nthe problem with all of these articles and the Dr. Phil show there is an <br/>\naspect of oddity watching that is going on. And they never really talk up <br/>\nthe wonderfulness that this freak show incorporates.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a section with the heading Risks Involved that begins with Nel <br/>\nNoddings (I love that name!), education prof. emeritus at Stanford (&#39;cause <br/>\nthat is important!) saying that learning deficits can result from letting <br/>\nchildren learn what they want. As if children who are forced to learn what <br/>\nthey don&#39;t want are the acme of knowledge and have no gaps in their <br/>\nunderstanding of whatever it is one must understand to be declared <br/>\nedumacated. Linnaea knows that she likes eating reeces peanut butter cups <br/>\nupside down at 6! I have no idea where she can go from there, but it can&#39;t <br/>\nbe anything but good. And Pat Farenga chimes in with his line &quot;I define <br/>\nunschooling as allowing children as much freedom to explore the world as you <br/>\ncan comfortably bear.&quot; Which is great in that it increases the number of <br/>\nunschoolers by so many times that it becomes hard to distinguish unschoolers <br/>\nfrom anyone else. I mean many parents of schooled children, I imagine, could <br/>\nnot comfortably bear allowing their children the freedom to stay home from <br/>\nschool, and so become unschoolers within the framework Mr. Farenga sets out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know, the article is all over the board. I don&#39;t think the author <br/>\nhad a clear sense of what she wanted it to be. And it comes across as many <br/>\nof the other articles do, a sort of look at the difference, but don&#39;t go <br/>\nthere &#39;cause it could be too dangerous. Nel Noddings (of Stanford) does say <br/>\nthat unschoolers may be our saviors: &quot;Perhaps these kids may help the world <br/>\nbe a less miserable and less structured place,&quot; she said. &quot;Perhaps they&#39;ll <br/>\nhave something to say against the overly bureaucratic system we have now.&quot; <br/>\nSo there is that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Sandra Dodd&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, December 21, 2006 5:59 AM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] I was interviewed, and...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; ...and I can&#39;t get in the mood to read it.
