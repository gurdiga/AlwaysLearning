There are toddlers<br/>\nwho thwart all attempts at discretion but who cannot tolerate delays<br/>\nuntil they get to a more private place.  However, I think mothers should<br/>\ndo the best they can to breastfeed discretely.

Not sure what the right answer is, but I do<br/>\nbelieve that what ever it is, it is certainly worth bringing it up for<br/>\ndiscussion at the Conference meeting tomorrow.  Thank you all for your<br/>\nwisdom.  And if you get this note tonight or first thing in the am, and<br/>\nwant ot write more, please do.  The meeting isn&#39;t until 10:00 am<br/>\nCalifornia time, and also the program book doesn&#39;t go to print until<br/>\nMarch, so there is still plenty of time to hash this issue out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI knew I&#39;d get good and varied opinions here.

OTOH, sometimes the toddler is wiggly, and some midruff shows.<br/>\nSometimes the preschooler pops off to say hi to a friend, and for a few<br/>\nsecond your nipple is out in plain view. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s being<br/>\n&quot;blatant&quot; so much as not being &quot;discreet&quot;. I&#39;m discreet when I pull my<br/>\nunderwear up in public, or tell someone she has broccoli between her<br/>\nteeth. Those things are kind of embarrassing. Nursing my kid is  not. <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with Joylyn, too, that it&#39;s kind of insulting to be told<br/>\nsomething like this - sort of feeds right into the stereotype that LLLers<br/>\nare lacto-maniacs who love to expose their boobs everywhere. I&#39;m sure<br/>\nthey exist, although I&#39;ve never met one and I&#39;ve hung with a LLL crowd<br/>\nsince the seventies, on and off...
