It was exhilarating.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would write many posts and just delete them, because I had answered my own questions in the process.

Or at least reading and guessing what others will say. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Phoenix last weekend, Jennifer Anderson spoke, and said she reads at Radical Unschooling Info when she feels she needs help—just reads ANYthing, any topic that has lots of responses.
