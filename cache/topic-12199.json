We have a new influx of families in our homeschool group, so I&#39;ll be meeting some of these moms face to face for the first time.  Previously, our park days have been all kids playing together and also moving in and out of groups of 2 or more according to who was doing what, not age or sex.  They aren&#39;t all unschoolers, but plenty are &quot;relaxed&quot; homeschoolers, which is much easier to find common ground with than the school-at-homers.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- We walked up and first a mom showed us where the big girls were playing, and <br/>\n  where the little girls were, and then where the bigger boys were and where <br/>\n  the little boys were.
