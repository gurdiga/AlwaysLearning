The game requires the player to use different objects for solving problems. In order to obtain the object, the player has to type its name into the game. My step-daughter is now 7, but she liked playing this game even before she could read. The way she played it then was to ask me to write for her a list of names of things she wants to use on a paper and then she would type them in. These things were usually something like unicorn, princess, spaceship, mermaid, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince your daughter is more independent and likes to do things on her own, I&#39;d suggest getting her a picture dictionary which would give her easy access to spellings of things she wants to use in the game. Even without solving he puzzles, the main menu screen is also interactive and she can free play with the things she types in. It&#39;s lots of fun even for adults. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Linda&quot; &lt;healingsoulstice@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks so much for all of the suggestions.

Any Mario or Pokemon games will retain their value, even the old gameboy <br/>\ncolor ones still have value as long as the memory still works.  The gameboy <br/>\ncolor games had internal memory on the individual games and once the battery <br/>\ndies, it&#39;s toast.  That was corrected with the gameboy advance games where the <br/>\nmemory was charged through the game.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":331885657,"authorName":"Jennifer Schuelein","from":"&quot;Jennifer Schuelein&quot; &lt;fairiedust66@...&gt;","profile":"jenfromtx6","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Want recs for Nintendo DS games for younger child","postDate":"1282850648","msgId":57041,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGk1NmYwbyt1MjIyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGk9VmZadlgwR0hDY2stWEdTdjFEeFdIZ3U5bis1d19jMmZhMHpNN0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":57040,"nextInTopic":57042,"prevInTime":57040,"nextInTime":57042,"topicId":57030,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"One of the ways my son learned to read was through using his DS.

Also, it helped his hand/eye coordination, as he had issues with that due to his Asperger&#39;s Syndrome. Anyway, we bought the Dora games as well as the Winnie the Pooh games for him. Nintendogs was a big hit, as well. Anything animal oriented is fun. Also, there are cooking games that are very interesting and fun as well as educational. I would definitely get her Nintendogs! <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, k &lt;katherand@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Karl sticks close to me in a game that has a lot of reading.
