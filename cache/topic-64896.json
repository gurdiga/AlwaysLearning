Husband, I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Keith and I were in our 20&#39;s, we had a neighbor with a big cartoonish sheepdog, and I only saw that dog when we went to their door for some reason.  Their grown son hung out with us, so we would go there to pick him up sometimes.   That dog really wanted me to pet it, and I really wanted to know that dog.  They never took it for a walk, I never saw it out at all.  But the dog would jump toward me, or come toward me all tail-wagging, and if I reached out to pet it they would yell &quot;No, don&#39;t pet him!&quot; and he would pee.  He was SO EXCITED that someone new wanted to touch him that he would wet himself right there.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they had taken the dog out, let him see other people and other dogs, let him visit the neighbors, let me pet him, he would have stopped doing that.  He was needy of touch and attention and knowledge.  He wanted to smell me, he wanted to see how I was.  He didn&#39;t want to pee on me, or himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren want input.  They want to learn.  They want to explore, and make choices.  They want to feel loved and safe and protected and provided for.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould a person leave an attractive book in a child&#39;s room and say &quot;you cannot open that except once a week,&quot; would that make sense?  Kind or cruel?   <br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone left a toy out by a baby and slapped his hand every time he reached for it except one night a week, would that be generous to let him touch it one night a week, or just an act of lunacy on the part of the parent?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone left food near a hungry person and told him NO arbitrarily, would ANYONE think it was not mean or harsh?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone puts a television in the room of a young child and it sits there night after night and she can&#39;t use it, and then one night a week she can, that is sadistic and no one should be surprised if the child pees like a sheepdog who has never been touched by a kind stranger.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Sorry Sandra, I did think I was clear that she does not watch TV every night, but after re-reading my posts today I realise I was not.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a difference between the technicality of having said so and the honest report of WHY that is.<br/>\nMy kids don&#39;t watch TV every night and never did, but it when they didn&#39;t watch TV it was because they wanted to do something else more than that.

It&#39;s about her, not about you, not about the carpet. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, something that is as helpful to me today as it was when we were new to unschooling is to stop and pay attention when I find myself saying (or typing, or thinking) &quot;yeah, but...&quot;. For me, it&#39;s a pretty good indicator that I&#39;m not being open to other ideas and other perspectives on a situation. You&#39;ve received a lot of replies and a lot of good ideas -- re-read them and mull them over for a couple days. Every time you start thinking, &quot;yeah, but...&quot;, about the suggestions that&#39;ve been made, stop and ask yourself &quot;why not?&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re not encouraging you to encourage her to pee on the carpet; we&#39;re encouraging you to not let this be about the carpet or about what you want her to do. Peeing on the carpet is the indicator that something needs to be changed up, that how things are right now are not working for her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":504505579,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: not using the toilet and how to handle it","postDate":"1326311744","msgId":64936,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBT09UYVhPeTM4cG5ZNlQrSGc3QXFWS29odEhOY05ocytOd1laU0VFSjU4eVQxUXl1d0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBT09UYVhPTHlOTEVQVGhRczZacD09akdjQlZnMXFfUj1xVXo3dmdFR1dHb2hBcHJ0Z0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDEzMjYyODkyMDcuOTUyODUuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjg3MzExLm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4JPGplazRibCtxYjhnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8Q0FPT1RhWE9MeU5MRVBUaFFzNlpwPT1qR2NCVmcxcV9SPXFVejd2Z0VHV0dvaEFwcnRnQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64934,"nextInTopic":64939,"prevInTime":64935,"nextInTime":64937,"topicId":64896,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

(Some parents do. And some parents have lousy relationships with their kids.) Or did you do it at her pace when she was ready? And was it an all at once transition? With no retreats?

If so, that would encourage her to hide it even better. You could calmly ask her to get it. You could casually ask her to empty it.

But if she&#39;s hiding it so thoroughly it&#39;s more likely she was trying to avoid your reaction. Parents want kids to avoid the parents&#39; reaction by stopping what they&#39;re doing. Sometimes it works. Sometimes, when the need is strong and a child doesn&#39;t see another acceptable solution, the reaction drives the behavior into hiding.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really a good to involve kids in decisions like this instead of deciding for them. I know it&#39;s hard to switch gears since moms have to guess what kids need from the moment their kids are born, but the sooner you draw her into the decision making process, the more connected you&#39;ll be and the better you&#39;ll get at being where she is rather than thinking from where you want her to be.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So, are you saying it would be best to let her have the TV again,<br/>\n&gt; and offer her a solution to the weeing, rather than trying to stop<br/>\n&gt; the weeing by taking away the television?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d can&#39;t&#39; tell you that.

The problem started about a year ago when we took the potty out of her bedroom, as she kept hiding it, then it would end up getting spilt as no one knew it was there. I don&#39;t know why she started hiding it, but she was as school at the time so that may have something to do with it.

If it&#39;s happening at night it might be that she&#39;s afraid to go into the bathroom on her own at night. It may be that she needs you more than you think she does. If it is only happening when she&#39;s alone, don&#39;t let her be alone so much. Look at the situation when it is occuring and change that situation. She&#39;s little. She&#39;s 5.5 years old. She can totally agree with you when she isn&#39;t alone in her bedroom watching a video and needs to pee. Theoretically she&#39;s on board, but practically, in that moment, she&#39;s not old enough or mentally ready to make that kind of commitment. She isn&#39;t lying, and punishing isn&#39;t going to change why she&#39;s doing it. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;At this point I am usually downstairs working.

Let&#39;s try this instead.&quot; :-). <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t make threats, you&#39;re not left feeling you have to follow through on them. But if you do make one, there&#39;s no requirement that you have to follow through on it.

I have Googled for answers as to why she may do it and how to handle it, but all I&#39;ve come up with is people spanking their children for doing it.
