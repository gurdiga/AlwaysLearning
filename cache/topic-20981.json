Then I&#39;d also let my kids know to tell him to knock it off if he starts talking in inappropriate ways that make them uncomfortable.  Some kids may be too shy to do that, but mine have never been too shy to tell someone to stop doing something they didn&#39;t like.  Chamille was always good at changing things around, the diversion tactic if you will, and Margaux is VERY good at being extremely blunt.  I&#39;ve heard her tell the neighbor kids to stop doing whatever they are doing that is rude, or they need to go home right now.  She responds well to that sort of direct communication too.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy experience with kids that use swearing and inappropriate language in this way, are kids that are trying to get attention.  Somewhere, this kid is needing that.  If you end up needing to talk with the mom, perhaps go about it with that in mind, that maybe she needs to be interacting more with her son when they are at home so that when they go to park days she can let him romp around without having to monitor his behavior.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":326782993,"authorName":"Vidyut Kale","from":"Vidyut Kale &lt;wide.aware@...&gt;","profile":"vidyutgore","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Swearing","postDate":"1271958211","msgId":53253,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGwydDc5YzFkMWI0MTAwNDIyMTA0M3QzZTgzMWMyNXUxYWY5MjFmOTkxOGYzNTYwQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhxb3AzZyticm0zQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhxb3AzZyticm0zQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":53251,"nextInTopic":53254,"prevInTime":53252,"nextInTime":53254,"topicId":20981,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I try not to swear around kids.

Don&#39;t be shy and  <br/>\nembarrassed.  Don&#39;t say &quot;bad words&quot; and blush, because that would just  <br/>\namuse him and make him feel powerful, I think.  Tell him flat out what  <br/>\nit is you know he said and that you want it not to happen that day.   <br/>\nAnd I&#39;d smile and say &quot;okay?&quot;  Get his agreement.

Five or  <br/>\nsix wouldn&#39;t be (in my experience, not with most kids).  Another thing  <br/>\nI did was to charge the older kids in the group (whether my kids or  <br/>\nnot) to make things better, not worse, for younger kids.  &quot;You&#39;re the  <br/>\noldest&quot; can have power, among kids.  Even if the oldest is being  <br/>\nshamed a little bit, if it&#39;s that or continued damage, don&#39;t feel bad  <br/>\nthat you&#39;ve embarrassed him a little bit.  And I don&#39;t think it would  <br/>\nbe so embarrassing, especially if you and he have had a talk and he  <br/>\nknows what you&#39;re reminding him about, in that case.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso if you decide he can&#39;t behave well enough for you, maybe you  <br/>\ncould say aloud in front of the group that you&#39;re uncomfortable about  <br/>\nthe bad language and might not want to meet so often until [name of  <br/>\nthat boy] is a little older, maybe, or your boys are old enough to  <br/>\nspeak up.  If you wait and talk to the mom alone, you risk the  <br/>\nfriendship more, maybe, than if you&#39;re matter-of-fact and treat it  <br/>\nlike a condition of the park, as you would it being too windy, or too  <br/>\nsunny.

Both of these moms are good friends of mine.  I had also brought along 2 children who weren&#39;t mine.  So, there were 9 children in total...ages ranging from 6 - 12.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the 3 hours that we were there everything (I thought) was going fine.  The moms and I visited, and the kids played close by...but not close enough that we heard everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we drove home and the conversation began.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the children that I brought (the 12 yr old) told me that my friend&#39;s son (11) was talking inappropriately.  What concerned him the most was that it was in front of the 6 yr old.  There was a particular word used over and over and also used in a challenge to the boy I brought asking if he knew what it meant.  (&#39;P&#39; word for women&#39;s genitalia)  Later they were playing the &quot;telephone&quot; game and it and other rude comments were passed down the line by this one child in particular.  Apparently, this boy has also been telling a crude joke with several swear word to mine and other children.<br/>\n <br/>\nSwearing is not all.  This boy, also encouraged by another boy, was being rude and exclusive to the boy I brought.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow.  I swore when I was a kid.  I think some of it is just trying it on.  I&#39;m more concerned with the bullying type behaviour.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I&#39;m stuck!  The boy&#39;s mother is a VERY good friend.  We love spending time with her family - once or twice per week.  She struggles with comments about her boy (she&#39;s had many in the past) and I feel terrible that I am now going to be yet another person to complain to her about her son.  I don&#39;t know how to do with alienating her.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this a no brainer?  My instinct is to call her and tell her what&#39;s going on in a matter of fact way. It&#39;s also, unfortunately, to lessen contact with her son.  :(<br/>\n<br/>\nAny opinions?<br/>\n<br/>\nDebbie<br/>\n<br/>\nPS  I&#39;ve tried my best to tell a complete story while omitting what I think are unimportant details.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Swearing","postDate":"1248438475","msgId":46493,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM1N0Y0QUM4LTM5MEUtNDM3RS1CQzA2LTJDNERDRkVCMTE2N0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":20981,"nextInTopic":53221,"prevInTime":46492,"nextInTime":46494,"topicId":20981,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Apparently researchers were trying to show that swearing makes coping worse in bad situations but actually found it s the opposite.
