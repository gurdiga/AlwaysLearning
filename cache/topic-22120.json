The categories on the<br/>\nshow are very specific and mostly very real.  Yeah, sometimes they make no<br/>\nsense, but Life is like that!  So, contestants aren�t faced with the<br/>\ncategory �Math� and thus have no reason to think, �Oh geez�I suck at Math!�<br/>\nInstead, they get something like �Easy as ��  Then they get an answer like<br/>\n�2.14��  and they find that they know �pi� but they still think they suck at<br/>\nmath.  So, I agree.  Don�t name the �subjects��they�re too subjective<br/>\nanyway.  Kids are taught US history in grade X, but don�t know who Susan B.<br/>\nAnthony is.  Calling numbers and patterns and concepts and such �Math� is<br/>\ncreating a box for the HUGE thing that �math� really is.  And, just like<br/>\nShoeless Joe in �Field of Dreams�, �if you build it, they will come.�  If<br/>\nyou construct the box, the need to fit stuff in to it may be way too close<br/>\nfor anyone�s comfort.  (Yeah, I know Jeopardy categories are literally in<br/>\nboxes, and I�m in effect mixing my metaphors, but I have nursing brain and<br/>\nam lucky I remember how to spell �box�, let alone what pi equals.  Give me a<br/>\nbreak :-))<br/>\n<br/>\nTami (who was a �math Olympian� through 8th grade, but was thought to have<br/>\n�no head for numbers�  by the middle of 9th grade algebra.
