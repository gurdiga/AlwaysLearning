It was just in the <br/>\npaper today.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGuest Opinion: Let&#39;s work to stop snuffing out joys of learning<br/>\n<br/>\nANDREW HANSON<br/>\nTucson Citizen<br/>\nMay 30, 2002<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;A child said, &#39;What is the grass?&#39;<br/>\nfetching it to me with full hands;<br/>\nHow could I answer the child?<br/>\nI do not know what it is any more than he.&quot;<br/>\n- Walt Whitman<br/>\nI recently checked out from the school library a PBS video on the emergence <br/>\nof democracy in Athens in the sixth century B.C.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was rich and beautifully done. But as I savored the beauty of the Greek <br/>\nart, the wonder of those times, I couldn&#39;t help but reflect on how the <br/>\naverage high school student would react to this video.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can imagine, the kids would be somewhat attentive. After all, it&#39;s <br/>\non TV, a central icon in their world. But few would engage the material in <br/>\nany meaningful way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf encouraged by the promise of a quiz, or if given a worksheet of <br/>\nquestions, a large number would dutifully watch for the required elements. <br/>\nMany would complain, openly or in private, depending on the temper of the <br/>\nclass, that the video was boring or irrelevant. And that would be an honest <br/>\nassessment.<br/>\nFor them it is boring.<br/>\n<br/>\nHerein lies the central paradox of modern education. Never before have so <br/>\nmany images, so much information, such diverse perspectives, been <br/>\naccessible for study. Yet for millions of young people, this wealth may as <br/>\nwell not exist.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey have no passion for learning through study. They do not feel the <br/>\ncuriosity, the fascination and wonder that fuel the genuine search for <br/>\nunderstanding. Their motivation to learn has been severely damaged.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at the young people around you. Talk with them. Do they care about <br/>\nhistory, science or literature? What percentage of our youth can talk <br/>\nintelligently about anything academic? How many read for pleasure?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe answers do not paint a portrait of a youth with a thirst for knowledge. <br/>\nBut if we assume that this child entered the school system many years ago <br/>\nwith what Plutarch called &quot;that love of inquiry and observation which <br/>\nnature has implanted in our souls,&quot; we must ask, what has happened?How did <br/>\nthat bubbly, enthusiastic 5-year-old turn into a teen-ager who would rather <br/>\ndo anything but study?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe deepest, most critical fault in our formal schooling has been the <br/>\nsystematic creation of the passive learner. By controlling virtually all of <br/>\nthe important decisions in the student&#39;s life - what, when, why and how to <br/>\nlearn - the well-intentioned adults working in education have unwittingly <br/>\ndesigned a disaster.It&#39;s easy to see why educators would want to control <br/>\nthese decisions. One might argue that the professionals know best, that <br/>\nsuch matters are too important to leave to the judgment of children, and so <br/>\non. But the fatal flaw is that the essential questions of what and how to <br/>\nlearn are intrinsic to the learning process.<br/>\n<br/>\nForcing children to learn works no better than leading the proverbial horse <br/>\nto water, as our current difficulties so amply illustrate. In contrast, <br/>\npassionate learners pose their own questions, set their own goals and <br/>\nquench their own thirst. By denying children the opportunity to follow <br/>\ntheir hearts, replacing that model with one in which everything is decided <br/>\nfor them, we create passive, if not resisting, students whose only <br/>\nauthentic problem becomes how best to please the teacher and get the <br/>\nhighest grade for the least amount of effort.<br/>\n<br/>\nLarge amounts of research and commentary are directed at the formidable <br/>\nchallenge of better controlling the children and the curriculum. But no <br/>\nmatter how much we sugarcoat the work - or bully, cajole and manage the <br/>\nkids, or the teachers, for that matter - into &quot;covering&quot; the curriculum and <br/>\nbeing &quot;on task,&quot; we are not treating the root cause of the disease.<br/>\nWe only address the symptoms.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe drive to improve control over the children misses the whole point. We <br/>\ndon&#39;t need better control. We need less control. We&#39;re talking more power <br/>\nand freedom for the children to take charge of their very destinies and <br/>\nsouls. The scariest thing is to let go and trust the students, but that is <br/>\nexactly what we must do from the earliest years of schooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe social and economic costs of persisting in the educational status quo <br/>\nare immense. Alienation, aimlessness, acting out, dropping out, these <br/>\nproblems and many more are intimately connected to the systematic snuffing <br/>\nout of the joy of learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nActive learners don&#39;t need to be kept busy. They are impatiently searching, <br/>\nexperimenting, testing and questioning. They are healthy humans engaged in <br/>\nthe most marvelous of pursuits.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe passive learners are not responsible for this sadly dysfunctional <br/>\nsituation. They are the victims. To rob a child of his natural urge to <br/>\nstudy through the imposition of mindless busywork is simply criminal.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs citizens, parents and educators, we need to carefully examine and own <br/>\nour roles in this tragedy. Change is possible, but we must develop a <br/>\ncollective will to revolutionize schooling.<br/>\nCan we afford not to?<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrew Hanson is a public school teacher in Tucson.
