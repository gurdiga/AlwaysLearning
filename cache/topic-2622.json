My brother&#39;s parting words to him threatened<br/>\nhis life.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy older sister, on the other hand, maintained an almost life long wish<br/>\nthat our parents would be reunited (and after three &quot;I do&#39;s&quot; I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink she&#39;s found a happy marriage for herself, yet).  I think the<br/>\ndifference stems from the child&#39;s relationship to the soon-to-be-missing<br/>\nparent.  My sister may well have had a better life if my parents had<br/>\nstayed married.  I might not have survived it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think some kids are fine after divorce, or AT LEAST better off and I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think it&#39;s just the abused ones (though that word certainly gets<br/>\nused to cover an amazing array of behavior).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think almost all kids are still hurt by divorce.  Your view of the<br/>\nworld changes, of marriage, of family, of love, etc.  But, to be<br/>\nmeaningful, it has to be measured against the hurt of staying.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes the marriage hurts even more.  Certainly that would be true<br/>\nfor adults, why not kids?   Sometimes divorce is the better alternative,<br/>\nmaybe not a good one, but a better one.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn contemplating my own divorce, knowing I wanted out was the easier<br/>\npart.  It was much more difficult to choose between my daughter&#39;s<br/>\nunhappiness if I stayed with him and her unhappiness if I didn&#39;t.  Which<br/>\nwould hurt her more?  To not choose, was to choose.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t tell myself that she&#39;d be okay because I wanted to leave the<br/>\nmarriage.  I made two choices.  One for what was best for me and one for<br/>\nwhat was best for her.
