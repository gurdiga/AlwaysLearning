If we&#39;d restricted those shows because some of the values were at odds with our own, we would have taken away the opportunity for our son to come to that realization himself. And we also would&#39;ve missed some entertaining tv along the way :).<br/>\n<br/>\nHe knows that in real families sibling rivalry exists but also that those same siblings will have each other&#39;s backs and do kind things for each other -- many of the sitcoms we watch together depict that as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nWatching Pokemon turned him on to the Pokemon action figures and card game and video games -- he spent a lot of money over the years on Pokemon things, BUT it was a huge passion of his during those years. He wasn&#39;t too interested in too much other tv show-related stuff, and he had no interest at all in which clothes are cool, which shoes are cool, which cellphone is cool, etc. His main passions now are not at all related to tv shows or commercials.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe will tell you he dislikes that parents, especially dads, are often portrayed as idiots, but on some of the shows we watched we really liked the parents (Phil of the Future comes to mind). We wouldn&#39;t have discovered that if we&#39;d not watched the shows. Ironically, our most recent experience with parent/child conflict being seen as cool happened while we watched fireworks over the weekend -- a group of older teens behind us were being pretty tacky about their parents (who were not with them). <br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, you can totally avoid tv yet still walk into the nearest Walmart or take your child to the local park and experience plenty of values at odds with your own!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, don&#39;t automatically assume your kids are picking up on the same things you&#39;re picking up on in tv shows.

Dick Sutphen seems convinced that subliminal programming works but I&#39;m not. His tapes that I used in the 1990s have a hypnosis session on side 1 and subliminal suggestions embedded into music on side 2 and they&#39;re supposed to be used in conjunction with each other - side 1 once a day, side 2 as often as you like. Listening to side 2 as often as I liked reminded me of the time in the early 80s when my first step to quitting smoking was buying &quot;extra mild&quot; cigarettes that I had to suck on like a vacuum cleaner on steroids, as the saying goes, to get any sensation at all that I was actually smoking a cigarette; it was such an unsatisfying experience I was smoking more cigarettes to compensate, which in fact was the worst possible outcome, so I dropped that idea. With Dick Sutphen&#39;s tapes, I was sometimes listening to side 2 over and over for hours on end and that was wearing and very unsatisfying. If there was any effect at all I think it would have come from knowing already what the &quot;subliminal&quot; messages were and being reminded of them when I heard the music. That would be &quot;programming&quot; by association if anything (&quot;anchoring&quot; as they call it in NLP), not subliminal programming. But I don&#39;t think there was any effect. Side 2 always seemed like it was just music.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout five years ago, maybe four, I trialled something called Think Right Now For Windows on my computer. That was something more like the &quot;eat popcorn and drink coke&quot; idea - messages flashed onto the screen for a fraction of a second that supposedly bypassed my critical faculties and went directly into my subconscious mind. So, I could sit at my computer all day happily doing whatever I was doing while subliminally reprogramming myself. No sweat, no hours in the gym, etc. There was another version of this being heavily promoted at the time as technology the government tried to ban (alluding to the eat popcorn thing) - buy it now while you still can and that kind of line. After 30 days of using the Think Right Now software it had produced no noticeable effect and I wrote it off as a waste of $25. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think there&#39;s a major problem with claims about subliminal programming, certainly in the world of &quot;personal development&quot; in my own experience, in that nobody who uses it uses it on its own. So it&#39;s often the case that somebody will claim &quot;subliminal programming works&quot; but when they&#39;re questioned it turns out they&#39;re doing other things as well, maybe listening to hypnosis audios, practising &quot;creative visualization&quot;, attending workshops, hanging out at online forums, reading the &#39;right&#39; books, or whatever, and they&#39;re actually in circumstances where their life is improving because of their &quot;personal development regime&quot;, which includes subliminal programming therefore subliminal programming must be a contributing factor, therefore subliminal programming must work.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s an awful lot of &quot;mind control&quot; tosh doing the rounds these days, in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nBob</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"gruvystarchild","from":"&quot;gruvystarchild&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: some really lame tv commentary","postDate":"1278387655","msgId":55667,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGkwdThrNytja2VvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGkwdGljaStzNTdqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":55666,"nextInTopic":55668,"prevInTime":55666,"nextInTime":55668,"topicId":55628,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m trying to figure out just HOW tv places you into your reptilian brain functions....so far I ve been able to talk (as have my children) when watching tv.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-723693439\">I&#39;m trying to figure out just HOW tv places you into your &quot;reptilian&quot; brain functions....so far I&#39;ve been able to talk (as have my children) when watching tv.

The &quot;induction&quot; to each hypnosis session - the process of going from the beta brain waves of being wide awake and externally focussed to the alpha brain waves of being in a daydreamy state and internally focussed - takes about ten minutes. That&#39;s before getting to the purpose of the session. As I know from my own experience, any interruption of the induction brings the subject out of the process, so you need, to begin with, to be on your own somewhere quiet where you won&#39;t be disturbed for at least 30 minutes (a major reason why self-hypnosis audios were problematic for me in the 1990s). The hypnosis session itself lasts about 10-15 minutes and then there&#39;s the shorter process of returning to a wide awake state. Dick Sutphen told me (because I eventually wrote to him and asked) that, usually, before a change of belief or behaviour is likely to occur, a hypnosis session would need to be experienced daily for at least 90 days. That&#39;s 90 consecutive days.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I&#39;ve been on the internet, the idea of &quot;subliminal programming&quot; has been hugely popularised for commercial reasons.

Alpha waves are the major rhythm  <br/>\nseen in normal relaxed adults - it is present during most of life  <br/>\nespecially beyond the thirteenth year when it dominates the resting  <br/>\ntracing.

There is also research into Controlling Computers With  <br/>\nNeural Signals (in Scientific American) which uses Alpha and Mu waves.  <br/>\nIf alpha waves stop when thought happens, how could those waves be  <br/>\nused to perform a computer action if we have to stop thinking in order  <br/>\nto generate them?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat it really means is that people enjoy dabbling in pseudo-science.  <br/>\nThey are using faulty logic -- hypnosis may generate alpha but that  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean alpha indicates hypnosis, thinking may generate beta but  <br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t mean that beta indicates thinking (or that lack of beta  <br/>\nmeans lack of thinking) -- to draw a conclusion to fit their theory.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo get a more complete picture we need to know what the waves look  <br/>\nlike when we&#39;re deeply involved in a novel. Or watching a play. Or  <br/>\nplaying a video game. Or watching a sporting event. Or painting. Or  <br/>\ngazing down at a sleeping or nursing infant. (Not that it would  <br/>\nindicate anything. It would just be more data on how the brain  <br/>\noperates.) If alpha waves increased during those times, should we stop  <br/>\nthose things? Or does it merely mean that &quot;thinking stops alpha waves&quot;  <br/>\nand &quot;beta is present during mental activity&quot; are too simplistic and  <br/>\ndon&#39;t adequately describe what&#39;s going on?<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] some really lame tv commentary","postDate":"1278131721","msgId":55634,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlsUXlPUFl6TDUya2V0aVUtN0UwbVFnRU5Hd3dkZGJSSk1rbmVhYUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDRDMkU2MjdBLjcwODAxMDRAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDRDMkU2MjdBLjcwODAxMDRAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":55629,"nextInTopic":55636,"prevInTime":55633,"nextInTime":55635,"topicId":55628,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ken Wilber has been pretty interesting to follow.
