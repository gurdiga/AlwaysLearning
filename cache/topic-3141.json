You become ADDICTED to it when you finally get <br/>\ncontrol of your own life. It was after I got married that I had to <br/>\n&quot;deprogram&quot;. Went through a phase of not being able to turn it off for quite <br/>\na long time (years) before I gained self control.<br/>\nWhy not give your kids the ability to gain control from day one? Your kids <br/>\nWILL have control of all their own choices one day whether you like it or not.<br/>\nWhy not let them learn self control in their own home, a safe environment, <br/>\nbefore being on their own and not knowing what to do with the freedom?<br/>\nSame with food.<br/>\nOnly the things that are limited and controlled become objects of obsession.<br/>\nI am a health freak. My kids will hear my opinion on certain additives and <br/>\nsugars.<br/>\nAnd then they will decide for themselves what to do with that information.<br/>\nI keep a wide variety of foods available to them and they choose a lot of the <br/>\ngroceries.<br/>\nThey just asked me to do another &quot;food as art&quot; day with them and the first <br/>\nfood they requested was broccoli. Yes, broccoli. <br/>\nThey sometimes eat a sweet muffin or other &quot;unhealthy food&quot; before a meal and <br/>\nyou know what? It&#39;s never affected their appetite. They still eat vegetables, <br/>\npasta or whatever else is available.<br/>\nThe went through a huge binge of ice cream when I finally started relaxing. I <br/>\nstill have to buy them their OWN foods (still fearful that someone else will <br/>\neat it and they won&#39;t get more of the cherished item) but they are starting <br/>\nto relax too. Because they know it is available and not controlled by me...if <br/>\nthey want a food they ask me to pick it up at the store. No big deal.<br/>\nI have a nephew that hardly EVER brushes his teeth. I was horrified when I <br/>\nsaw the scum on them last summer. Once a week his Mom can&#39;t stand it anymore <br/>\nand brushes them for him. He is Nine and just saw the dentist last week. Not <br/>\na single cavity in his little head! Seems he has inherited the ability to <br/>\nkeep healthy teeth through sugar and not brushing.<br/>\nIf you are going to live in a society that uses sugar, tv etc... you better <br/>\nprepare your kids for that society. Not some society in which those things <br/>\nare not an option. If you don&#39;t want them to have access to tv or sugar, you <br/>\nbest not live in this country.<br/>\nHow long will you control access to those items? Until they are teens and <br/>\nhating the control you try to exert? At which point it won&#39;t matter, because <br/>\nyou will no longer have control anyway.<br/>\nBetter that they don&#39;t obsess with those things to start with. That they <br/>\nbecome just another option. They won&#39;t be acting like addicts when they visit <br/>\na friend or when your control is no longer an option.<br/>\nYou can&#39;t control your children, they are not objects to be owned. The <br/>\ncontrol will only last a short time, teach them to sneak behind your back and <br/>\neventually cause them to not confide in you. The feeling that we can control <br/>\nthem is false. We can only open or shut doors in the relationship. They will <br/>\nchoose their own path, with or without your approval.<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3361,"nextTopicId":3402}}
