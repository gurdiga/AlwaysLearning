My point was that even though this is an &#39;unschooling&#39; list, the way it is defined and discussed on this list seems to stretch to all corners of parenting, not just around alternatives to school or how to trust that your child will be okay without school. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis list is quite radical in my opinion, and as another poster wrote, attachment and mindful parenting groups are quite straight/mainstream/conventional next to this group. The subjects on this list are not comfortable, like in the attachment parenting discussions. The subjects on this list make me squirm and moan because I know Sandra and the other true unschooling mothers on this list are right but it takes a lot of work from me to let go of fear and what I think my daughter should be eating, watching, learning, etc. This list challenges me in all directions. It challenges me to really look at my relationship with her and how she is affected by my behavior. On this list I am learning how to raise a happy healthy human. On the other hand I hardly worry about whether she&#39;ll be &#39;educated&#39; without school. This seems easy compared to the relationship part. And this is what seems to me to start before any country-imposed &#39;school-age.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nErika<br/>\nMother of Momo (12)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBlissland1234 &lt;blissland1234@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;It seems to me that radical unschooling, as defined in these discussions, really is a mindset that can start kicking in at birth.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s disturbing to me that ideas about education have become so pernicious with regard to childhood that people find no contradiction at all when they say they want to &quot;unschool&quot; a baby - and I&#39;ve seen that, people show up on lists and groups saying &quot;I have a 10mo old and I want to start unschooling, what learning resources are best for this age?&quot; Blaaaaaahhhhh!

Most of the parents I know who were &quot;unschooling&quot; toddlers when Mo was a toddler are either homeschooling now or have kids in school.

We are active in the only local homeschool group that is even remotely acceptable for us. All the others are religious based and I am an atheist so we would not fit in any of them. Anyway, the other parents in our group consider themselves AP but none of them are also unschooling. I find myself getting bothered by the way they speak to and treat their children in front of mine. Sometimes they  can be downright mean, telling them to go away when they try to sit with the adults without bothering to listen to the child at all, refusing to let them eat when they are obviously very hungry because they didn&#39;t finish all their food before they left the house.

The fact that our children don&#39;t go school seems to be a side affect of this way of thinking.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAttachment parenting, maybe.  Mindful parenting.  But why &quot;unschooling&quot; if a child isn&#39;t of school age?  <br/>\nAnd what of a parent who claims to be unschooling, but then when the child is five or six, she goes into school? <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":469007280,"authorName":"Jen Beeman","from":"Jen Beeman &lt;taxicrab@...&gt;","profile":"taxicrab87","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling since pregnancy, was family decisions","postDate":"1356826098","msgId":70035,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBUHVtWGE3YzJCX3dBUE5kRTZCZ2E9YUtwUGIraTZMRDJBa2FLVV9ZczFMay1wa3BFZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":70032,"nextInTopic":70039,"prevInTime":70034,"nextInTime":70036,"topicId":70017,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"==I think that before any children are school aged, whatever you do would just be considered your parenting style. == I agree with this but I find that even","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-741359071\">==I think that before any children are school aged, whatever you do would<br/>\njust be considered your parenting style. ==<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with this but I find that even among people who consider themselves<br/>\nto be attachment parenting (or peaceful parenting, gentle parenting, or<br/>\nwhatever label you would like to use) there is a very often a lack of<br/>\npartnership with children and a lack of trusting children. My oldest is 2.5<br/>\nand among my friends with kids her age and younger there is  a lot of<br/>\nconversation about how to get kids to eat vegetables, how terrible sweets<br/>\nare and how kids will eat in excess if you don&#39;t stop them, how their kids<br/>\nwould never sleep unless forced to, how bad &quot;screen time&quot; and other &quot;tech<br/>\ntime&quot; is and that it must be limited, which toys to let their kids have for<br/>\nthe most educational value, referring to children as brats, and other<br/>\nsimilarly disrespectful things that I choose to avoid.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t refer to myself as an unschooling parent, because I&#39;m not one yet,<br/>\nbut I do  think there are a lot of aspects of my parenting that are very<br/>\ninfluenced by unschooling ideas and by my own deschooling process. For<br/>\ninstance, I am much more relaxed about academic and pre-academic learning<br/>\nthan I would be if I had never encountered unschooling ideas - we sing the<br/>\nABCs and count things and play with a few flash cards and letter and number<br/>\npuzzles that my daughter likes, but I don&#39;t spend my energy trying to teach<br/>\nher things or worrying that she doesn&#39;t know this or that particular thing<br/>\nthat some kids her age know. When I pick out a toy for my kids, I choose it<br/>\nbecause I think they will enjoy it not because I think it&#39;s &quot;good for&quot;<br/>\nthem. I also feel like I am able to see the learning in every day<br/>\nactivities much more so than I would be able to without the tools and ideas<br/>\nI have picked up here.<br/>\n<br/>\n==It seems to me that radical unschooling, as defined in these discussions,<br/>\nreally is a mindset that can start kicking in at birth.

I don&#39;t consider us to be<br/>\nunschooling but I do think there are aspects of my parenting that are (for<br/>\nthe most part) only shared by parents who are or are intending to unschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nJen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling since pregnancy, was family decisions","postDate":"1356819102","msgId":70032,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtibnBxdStvcDU0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDc2Mjc4OUQ1LUZDNzktNDIwMy04MjA0LTlEQjVEODE0ODk3NUB5YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":70017,"nextInTopic":70035,"prevInTime":70031,"nextInTime":70033,"topicId":70017,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"==  You have been *learning* about unschooling since pregnancy, but you have not yet started unschooling.
