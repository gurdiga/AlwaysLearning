I&#39;ve been in England and Indiana and going through <br/>\nremodel, ugh.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was having a homebirth with Tamzin, was in labour for 16 <br/>\nhours, had gone into 2nd stage and the midwives realized that <br/>\nTamzin was in posterier position.  I couldn&#39;t push her out, so an <br/>\nambulance came and took me to the hospital where they gave <br/>\nme an epidural (in case I had to have an emergency C-section) <br/>\nand tried to turn her around using the vacuum thingy.  I was in <br/>\n2nd stage for 5 hours and was so torn up when they finally got <br/>\nher turned and out that they had to do some pretty extensive <br/>\nrepair work on me.  In hindsight, I wish that they had done a <br/>\nC-section on me!  I was so out of it by then that I couldn&#39;t <br/>\nadvocate for myself and Chris didn&#39;t have the knowledge or <br/>\ngumption to step in and advocate for me.  I never thought I&#39;d ever <br/>\nwant a C-section over vaginal birth, but in certain circumstances <br/>\nit&#39;s definitely a good option to have.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeghan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":96795689,"authorName":"Tuckervill@aol.com","from":"Tuckervill@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Government papers","postDate":"1051986392","msgId":14059,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJhLjNkYmE3OTM3LjJiZTU2M2Q4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":14058,"nextInTopic":14060,"prevInTime":14058,"nextInTime":14060,"topicId":14053,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/3/2003 12:01:11 PM Central Daylight Time, ...
