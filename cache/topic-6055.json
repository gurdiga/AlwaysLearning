I won&#39;t tell you that the<br/>\nauthor was in the bin when he wrote this.<br/>\nDeb L<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom<br/>\nPoetry Daily<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.poems.com/\">http://www.poems.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Of Jeoffry, His Cat&quot;<br/>\nby Christopher Smart (1763)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor I will consider my Cat Jeoffry.<br/>\nFor he is the servant of the Living God, duly and daily serving him.<br/>\nFor at the first glance of the glory of God in the East he worships<br/>\n   in his way.<br/>\nFor this is done by wreathing his body seven times round with<br/>\n   elegant quickness.<br/>\nFor then he leaps up to catch the musk, which is the blessing of<br/>\n   God upon his prayer.<br/>\nFor he rolls upon prank to work it in.<br/>\nFor having done duty and received blessing he begins to consider<br/>\n    himself.<br/>\nFor this he performs in ten degrees.<br/>\nFor first he looks upon his fore-paws to see if they are clean.<br/>\nFor secondly he kicks up behind to clear away there.<br/>\nFor thirdly he works it upon stretch with the fore-paws extended.<br/>\nFor fourthly he sharpens his paws by wood.<br/>\nFor fifthly he washes himself.<br/>\nFor sixthly he rolls upon wash.<br/>\nFor seventhly he fleas himself, that he may not be interrupted upon<br/>\n   the beat.<br/>\nFor eighthly he rubs himself against a post.<br/>\nFor ninthly he looks up for his instructions.<br/>\nFor tenthly he goes in quest of food.<br/>\nFor having consider&#39;d God and himself he will consider his neighbor...<br/>\nFor he can catch the cork and toss it again.<br/>\nFor he is hated by the hypocrite and miser.<br/>\nFor the former is afraid of detection.<br/>\nFor the latter refuses the charge.<br/>\nFor he camels his back to bear the first notion of business.<br/>\nFor he is good to think on, if a man would express himself neatly.<br/>\nFor he made a great figure in Egypt for his signal services.<br/>\nFor he killed the Icneumon-rat very pernicious by land.<br/>\nFor his ears are so acute that they sting again.<br/>\nFor from this proceeds the passing quickness of his attention.<br/>\nFor by stroaking of him I have found out electricity.<br/>\nFor I preceived God&#39;s light about him both wax and fire.<br/>\nFor the Electrical fire is the spiritual substance, which God sends<br/>\n   from heaven to sustain the bodies both of man and beast.<br/>\nFor God has blessed him in the variety of his movements.<br/>\nFor, tho&#39; he cannot fly, he is an excellent clamberer.<br/>\nFor his motions upon the face of the earth are more than any other<br/>\n   quadrepede.<br/>\nFor he can tread to all the measures upon the musick.<br/>\nFor he can swim for life.<br/>\nFor he can creep.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6032,"nextTopicId":6027}}
