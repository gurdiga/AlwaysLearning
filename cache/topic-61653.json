I have been &quot;studying&quot; unschooling extensively starting when my oldest was 3, in order to really get it, and to apply my understanding to my parenting.  And I will continue to work on getting it more fully, for years and years.  I haven&#39;t yet unschooled a school-aged child, so I don&#39;t *really* know what that&#39;s like.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I really don&#39;t expect others to &quot;get it&quot; at all.  I expect them to not understand and to think we are weird and maybe even crazy.  Or that we&#39;re limiting, sheltering, school-at-homers.  Mostly that!  So I don&#39;t even want to discuss it.  It&#39;s similar to the feeling I had about people knowing we were &quot;still nursing&quot; when my son was way, way past his first birthday.  Except I can&#39;t expect to just keep this private.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nParenting continues to get me to stretch and grow beyond comfortable limits.  I don&#39;t need pat answers, I need to work on being confident and comfortable even with subtle disapproval of friends and neighbors and acquaintances.  Happily, the grandparents trust our judgement, and most other close family has responded well when I&#39;ve pointed out that I could go back to work and teach (speech and language) other people&#39;s children while someone else teaches mine, but we enjoy being together so we&#39;ll do it as long as we all want to and are able.  (Actually, I think that&#39;s my pat answer!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list is such a huge help to me.  I really appreciate the wisdom and experience here.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, <br/>\n<br/>\nmaryann<br/>\nDS 5<br/>\nDD 1</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Your favorite replies about why/what/how","postDate":"1308588043","msgId":61666,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk2RTREMTBCLUFFNzMtNDQzQi04RjVELTczNjkxOTYwMUZFN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGl0bmNlcCtuNzFqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGl0bmNlcCtuNzFqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61663,"nextInTopic":61683,"prevInTime":61665,"nextInTime":61667,"topicId":61653,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- Even though we have yet to get connected with unschooling or homeschooling communities I talk about the many groups out there and the kinds of things they","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1603737001\">-=-<br/>\nEven though we have yet to get connected with unschooling or homeschooling communities I talk about the many groups out there and the kinds of things they are doing without saying explicitly whether or not I will be doing those things.
