Oh gosh, just the thought of it <br/>\nis enough to evoke my migraine LOL!! On our trips back to Malaysia, <br/>\nwe only stopover for 2 hours or so in Dubai airport, even that is <br/>\ntoo long for DS LOL!! In moments like this, I do think certain <br/>\nluxury is a must-for my sanity.

But would like to suggest pacing your day out. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe airport&#39;s are busy with lots of strangers walking by. And to be <br/>\nin such environment, you&#39;ll be on guard, watching your kids all the <br/>\ntime, so I can imagine, being stuck in the same airport, you are <br/>\nright about the 3pm moment when you&#39;re tired and out of ideas and <br/>\nthe kid&#39;s getting cranky. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo perhaps, consider taking that hourly hotel option to start off <br/>\nwith, for an hour or 2, before commencing what you have already <br/>\nplanned? This way, you might be lucky enough to start winding down <br/>\nat the departure lounge closer to 6pm.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWith the hourly hotel option to start the day off first, you can let <br/>\nyour defense down and probably catch some much needed rest before <br/>\nfacing the rest of the day - nothing worse than a cranky mum.  The <br/>\nkids can spread out in the room and rest abit or do whatever they <br/>\nwant, chill before venturing out into the airport. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith meal times in between, you stand less chance of them being <br/>\nbored and restless. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll the best. <br/>\n<br/>\nSharonBugs. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Helen Cain &lt;hfcain@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We are off on a trip to Ghana (from Australia), where DH comes <br/>\nfrom, <br/>\n&gt; leaving on Boxing Day.
