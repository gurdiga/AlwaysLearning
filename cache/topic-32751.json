At some point I&#39;ll go buy a couple of cameras for the other computers so that we can be visible in every possible state of life. I&#39;ve been talking to a Alex in Minnesota lately and I get to see her and her children living their lives and I feel so much more connected to them.

My immediate <br/>\nresponse, which I kept to myself, was that she should just email her <br/>\ngrandchild or write legibly for her.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, I find cursive hard to read and I know how to write it.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve tried to read the cursive handwriting of very very old people, <br/>\nsometimes long dead people, and I find myself figuring words by <br/>\ncontext because I can&#39;t read all of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother isn&#39;t afraid of computers, uses them all the time, yet her <br/>\nthought process is still in the realm of handwriting and mail post <br/>\nrather than electronic email and typing to her granddaughter.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThought processes change with the newness of things available.  I was <br/>\nthinking email was a middle ground, since, my daughter really only <br/>\nsends and receives messages through things such as myspace and IMing <br/>\nothers.  She rarely even checks her email inbox, has an email addy <br/>\nonly for opening other accounts for access to other things cool on <br/>\nthe internet, yet I know she would keep her eye out for ecards and <br/>\nmail from her grandma.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never played Halo, but I have played toontown with lots of other <br/>\nfolks.  To reject an idea so outright seems really old fashioned and <br/>\nstuck in yesterday thought.
