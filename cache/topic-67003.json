You push her away, even subconciously, even out of her hearing, and she will feel it and feel that she&#39;s right in her fear that you&#39;ll not come back one day or take too long and she&#39;ll cling tighter and longer.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, just an aside, my oldest daughter was *very* attached, my second daughter was not as &#39;clingy&#39;, and my third child, now 4 years old, didn&#39;t want to be touched at all from when he was 4 months old (right after he got out of intensive care at the hospital) until almost right at his 3rd birthday. It&#39;s a lot more painful to have a child not want to be touched at all, ever, in any way, even crying out in his sleep if you kiss him, than it is annoying to have a child that wants to touch you all of the time. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I noticed at five Ethan&#39;s general fears became strong at times, and &gt;he began to express emotions in a very big way.

On a child&#39;s fifth birthday they go to sleep in the family bed where they&#39;ve always slept and in the morning they wake up in a different family&#39;s bed in the same tribe. They may pass their mother in the street but she won&#39;t acknowledge them until they&#39;ve accepted that the *tribe* is their family, and the child will never live with their birth family again.

We sometimes get weird looks and comments, but it is who he is.  In our case, though, he went to preschool and hated every minute (well, almost) of it.  And I hated leaving him.  But that&#39;s just &quot;what you did&quot; so I did it.  His temperament may play a part, but &quot;leaving him&quot; over and over again broke a bond of trust that I still work very hard to get back. <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember being at a beach gathering a year or so ago and the moms were sitting on chairs farther up from the water and the kids had all gone down to the water.  My son wanted me to go down to the water with him.  The moms were all giving reasons why he should be able to go by himself, and to be honest I was torn for a moment - lounging around with a cocktail in hand was inviting.  But I chose to bring comfort and confidence to my son, and walked to the water with him.  There I witnessed the kids happily playing in the water, where they found all sorts of neat sea creatures, and I was able to be by myself with no &lt;adult&gt; distractions.  Once he was settled in with the other kids, I stood there on the beach and looked out at the vast Gulf of Mexico with the sun setting slowly and had such a profound sense of peace it still brings tears to my eyes when I think back on it. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh what I would have missed if I had said &quot;just go, you&#39;re being silly&quot;.  Not only would I have missed my own profound moment of peace, but I would have eroded the trust that I work so hard to gain.  I&#39;m not saying every time you join your daughter where she needs you to be will be like this, but it COULD be.  And you don&#39;t want to miss it. <br/>\n<br/>\n5 is so young in the big picture.  It won&#39;t last forever.  I still remember vividly the day my son DIDN&#39;T interrupt me or ask me to play with him several times a day. I felt a little crack in my heart - I thought ah, he saw I didn&#39;t want to be with him, and now he doesn&#39;t want to be with me (though I&#39;m pretty sure this is not literally true, he was older and better equipped to do things on his own, it&#39;s absolutely what I felt at the time).  I&#39;m betting you will not like that day either, and you will wish for the days when your daughter longed to be with you all the time. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy choices are usually made by asking myself (and I have to pay homage to Sandra for this) &quot;will this strengthen my relationship with my child?&quot;  Within that framework, most choices are pretty easy. <br/>\n<br/>\n--Melissa <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Rather than seeing this as a problem, shift your view to see it as a gift - your little girl adores you sooooooo much she doesn&#39;t want to be without you.

Let her know that you will be stepping away for a moment, and invite her to join you if she wants.  Think of it as an act of kindness and love and consideration.  It really is.  The bonus too is that she will grow to trust you more and more every time you consider her emotional well being.  Gradually she won&#39;t need to hold on so tightly, but she will also know, without a doubt, that you will do your best to be there if and when she does need you.  I don&#39;t know because I haven&#39;t gotten there yet, but that, to me, seems like it could be a big plus for the teenage years.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It is stressful for me to never be able to have a moment away.

I had to learn how to do that in the presence of my son.  If he was immersed in building with blocks or doing some other activity, I would take an inner moment for myself while I sat there with him.  It wasn&#39;t long and it wasn&#39;t easy at first, but it became easier.  I think Thich Nhat Hanh has some suggestions for doing meditation in busy places.  I remember being in a meditation class a few years ago, and the teacher talked about meditating at a retreat where there was a lot of construction happening very close by.  He said the act of meditating in such a noisy environment was one of his most challenging and yet rewarding meditation exercises.  I have a card on my fridge that says, &quot;Peace.  It does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work.  It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart.&quot;  Similar thing, I believe.    <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I wanted to go to lunch with my husband today, we don&#39;t do this very often at all, and she refused to stay with my Mom, kept following me to the car, crying.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>During this time (which really won&#39;t last long) maybe you and your husband could pack a picnic lunch, throw a blanket down on the living room floor, put on one of your daughter&#39;s favourite movies or get together some of her favourite activities on a special blanket of her own, and share a nice moment with you husband while you daughter is close by.  Invite your daughter to join you.  She might come and go.  She might just stay.  Either way, you and your husband can witness her joy while sharing a special moment together.  That, to me, would be infinitely more relaxing than going out to lunch after you have just left your daughter crying in a car.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;She says she is afraid I will not come back. That I take too long when I go out, I am usually gone 1 1/2 hours, and she gets scared.  Offered to call her while gone but that didn&#39;t help. I try and reasure her that I will come home (I suppose there is always the possibilty that I will not) but she is not being comforted.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think that the harder you push, the more resistance you will meet.  My son, Ethan, liked constant contact until around the age of five or six.  He liked to sit right next to me so that our bodies were always touching.  If we sat across from each other at the table, he would hook feet with me.  We slept together every night and, even then, he was always reaching a leg or an arm out for me in his sleep.  He is nine now.  He sleeps most nights on his own.  He is reasonably confident in his relationships with the people in his life.  I remember feeling kind of self conscious for how much time he and I spent together because it was not seen as normal in my family, but he seemed to need it, and, in hindsight, I wouldn&#39;t change a moment of it.  I passes faster than it ever feels like it could when you are in the moment.  There are some nights I really miss that closeness with him.  I just want to roll back the clock.  But, I can&#39;t, and all is as it should be. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My husband is frustrated and though I am holding my patience, inwardly I am feeling not so good about this.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My husband grew more okay with my time with Ethan as *I* grew more okay with my time with Ethan.  Some of my husband&#39;s frustration came from seeing me frustrated.  As I learned to love my time with my son, my husband relaxed, loved being with us, and felt more secure being away from us.  I made sure that I did lots of little things for my husband too, so that he felt equally loved and not left out.  Seeing the positive impact my loving efforts were having on my family kept me moving forward and feeling better about my choices every day.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I know she will not be little for ever but tomorrow I did agree to work for a friend because my husband is not working and I am not sure how I should handle leaving.

If not, can she come with you?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have been a stay at home unschooling mom for her whole life.

Don&#39;t go to the garage, the front gate, to meditate without her. She&#39;s five and she&#39;s feeling your absence very pointedly. She won&#39;t be five forever. Give her the time she needs to have you with her. It helps if you can see what a sweet thing it is to be able to make the world a better place for her just by being near. That&#39;s an amazing gift to be able to give. The world is brighter and safer and better and more full of love and happiness for her when you are near. Cherish that. The more you can make it true, the more you can enjoy being with her, the more that can make your world brighter and safer and better and more full of love and happiness by being near her, well, that&#39;s a good thing. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n From: joanne.lopers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wilmalv@...\">wilmalv@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Thursday, 3 May 2012, 21:51<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Separation Anxiety in 5 year old Daughter<br/>\n <br/>\nMy daughter will not let me go anywhere without her.  I currently cannot walk the dogs around the block when my husband is home and her neighbor friends are over without her needing to come with me.  We do a coop once a week and if I leave the room for a minute without telling her, she crys.  I try my hardest to tell her every time I go somewhere, out the front gate, to the garage, but I do forget sometimes if she is busy doing something.
