This book is written<br/>\nmonth by month.  The author talks almost poetically about the rhythms of<br/>\nnature, noticing them, very intimate moments in her life with nature and<br/>\nsharing her love of the earth with children.  She also mentions how several<br/>\nreligions interpret the changes of nature, from Paganism to Judaism.  In<br/>\neach month/chapter, she talks about a particular herb and gives recipes for<br/>\nvarious herbal mixtures.  I thought it was a wonderful book and gave me a<br/>\nrenewed way to look at our earth and how to share that with my kids.  We<br/>\nmade several of the herbal mixtures and continue to use them.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie--who is so very glad to be here</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":314,"nextTopicId":318}}
