That this kind of learning is the best kind of learning<br/>\nfor our human types of organisms. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince it isn&#39;t provable at this point beyond personal experience, why should<br/>\nthe teaching theory that advocates using the carrot and a stick method hold<br/>\nmore weight than the personal experience of individual families who have found<br/>\nthat the carrot and the stick approach distorts and limits the potential of<br/>\nthe human mind to learn? <br/>\n<br/>\nIsn&#39;t taking a position inherently arrogant?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Maybe I just have genetic matches for me and a man I would choose to<br/>\n&gt; spend <br/>\n&gt;most of my life with.

Teaching and learning separate from our emotions, our<br/>\nhistory, our hopes for the future, or our economic and political realities.<br/>\nBut this isn&#39;t possible. How we view our children affects them and us from the<br/>\nvery first contact. How we ourselves were treated as children continues to<br/>\ncolor and shape our views all through our adulthood. I believe passionately<br/>\nthat all children are born innocent, and baring organic disease, if treated<br/>\nwith loving kindness and generosity will become kind and generous and loving.<br/>\nThere are those who just as passionately believe that children are born in sin<br/>\nand only through strict training and diligence on the part of their caretakers<br/>\nwill that sin be kept at bay. Both of us have a fertile ground to sow our<br/>\ntheories because the early pre-verbal years of a child&#39;s life are shape able<br/>\nin ways that we used to know only instinctively and now know medically. We now<br/>\nknow that early mental and physical experience literally forms children and<br/>\ntheir emotions and brain patterns.

It fell on the floor and rolled away when I read <br/>\nthis last night. Today I thought I would browse around this site, maybe to <br/>\nsee if there was anything better? Maybe some masochistic feeling I had to <br/>\nplacate in myself? I found a horrific article on how to *train* a three month <br/>\nold! And another that discussed the finer points of spanking, and what <br/>\nimplement of plumbing fixtures was best fit for bequeathing a beating upon <br/>\nchildren. (Remember to always swat yourself on the leg first to remind how <br/>\nhard to hit.) Another discussed breastfeeding, and how to properly train new <br/>\nbabies to only nurse when it is convenient for mom. No nursing on demand, you <br/>\nwill soon have a spoiled child on your hands! Then I found an article that I <br/>\nthought might be the one redeeming factor, a ray of light perhaps? It started <br/>\nwith, what I thought sounded like some good Unschooling thoughts. I was <br/>\nbeginning to think that maybe this might be one article I could recommend to <br/>\nChristian homeschoolers wondering how to fit Unschooling and Christianity <br/>\ntogether. But the article, which started out so promising, had this to say <br/>\nabout the roles girls and boys play in life. If only the author had been able <br/>\nto omit the three sentences at the end! <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could follow this rule: If a workbook can be enjoyed by the <br/>\nchildren, if they desire to do it just for fun, then it cannot be harmful <br/>\nunless they become so absorbed in books that they neglect the important <br/>\nsocial and work aspects of family. Except on rare occasions, book studies <br/>\nshould never consume a large part of the day. Children should be engaged in <br/>\nwork and play with their families. A young daughter needs to begin early <br/>\nlearning and practicing to be a wife, mother, and home-keeper. A boy should <br/>\nbegin early, two years old, practicing to be the man of the house and the <br/>\nPresident of the United States. He should be given responsibility and an <br/>\nimportant role in sustaining the family. Our first concern should be the <br/>\ndevelopment of character, work ethic, and personal confidence. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can read the whole article here. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nogreaterjoy.org/ngjw1/037%20Curriculum.htm\">http://nogreaterjoy.org/ngjw1/037%20Curriculum.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":112038769,"authorName":"Shyrley","from":"&quot;Shyrley&quot; &lt;shyrley.williams@...&gt;","profile":"bobalinga","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Re: I&#39;ll try again","postDate":"1036869210","msgId":10499,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIxMTA5MTkwOTA2LlZLWFQzNTUzLm91dDAxOC52ZXJpem9uLm5ldEBtYXJrc2NvbXB1dGVyPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDJkLjI2NGY1MDYzLjJhZmViNmVhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":10498,"nextInTopic":10501,"prevInTime":10498,"nextInTime":10500,"topicId":10480,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
