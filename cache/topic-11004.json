For many years he&#39;d ALWAYS be mistaken for a girl, but <br/>\nI was terribly impressed that he never seemed to care. Sometimes he&#39;d <br/>\ncasually say, &quot;Actually, I&#39;m a boy,&quot; which would send the person into fits of <br/>\nembarassment. Julian never considered it an insult though.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce he hit puberty, even with the hair, he was never mistaken for a girl. He <br/>\njust the opther day got his haior cut, and for the first time said I could <br/>\nwait in the waiting area rather than come over with him. He usually doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwant his hair cut too short, because he likes his curls. Well, the <br/>\nhairdresser talked him into this short cut which looks lovely, but it wasn&#39;t <br/>\nHIM. His hair has NEVER been this short. He was quite uncomfortable with it <br/>\nat first, but he&#39;s okay. He&#39;s going to let it grow again though.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10976,"nextTopicId":11006}}
