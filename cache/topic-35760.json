I think kids will figure out a lot  <br/>\nof math on their own from dance, because if it&#39;s in four, you&#39;re  <br/>\ngoing to come up with 16s and 32s, and if in 3, you&#39;re not getting to  <br/>\nany 16s.  And it will take two measures or four to get back to  <br/>\nstarting on the foot you started on (if you&#39;re in three).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I see the musical side of dancing (and the math side of music).   <br/>\nI don&#39;t see the spelling side at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have overtly educational games--tons of them.  We didn&#39;t  <br/>\nnecessarily play them &quot;right.&quot;  We rarely felt obligated to play ANY  <br/>\ngame &quot;right.&quot;  We play encore without the game board, always team on  <br/>\nteam.  We&#39;ve made up house rules to lots of things.  A friend gave us  <br/>\na set of Cuisenaire (sp?) rods, and some laminated papers to go with  <br/>\nthem.  The papers were ***STUPID*** and I don&#39;t use that word  <br/>\nlightly; I don&#39;t use that word much at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI woke up this morning thinking I really should&#39;ve put on the &quot;how to  <br/>\nscrew up unschooling&quot; list &quot;Call things &#39;stupid.&#39;&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I don&#39;t take this back.  With these very nice-to-feel  <br/>\nproportional &quot;math manipulatives,&quot; they were forming letters by  <br/>\nputting different rods on different outlined places on a laminated  <br/>\nmat.  And the numbers were there.  On the P, there were some long  <br/>\npieces for the vertical line, and then on the round part there were  <br/>\nsome twos, and two threes and a four I think.  UNDOUBTEDLY some  poor  <br/>\nkid (or a few hundred thousand) kept in mind that a P is made up of  <br/>\nsome threes and a four and... and it has nothing whatsoever on earth  <br/>\nor in heaven (or hel) to do with it.  Nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we didn&#39;t use those.  I showed them to my kids who said, &quot;WHAT!?&quot;  <br/>\nand then went on doing something maybe as equally unrelated to the  <br/>\ndesigner&#39;s intent, but of their own choosing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe things they learn with cuisenaire rods, they can learn with Lego,  <br/>\nbut still those rods are pretty and they sound good when they clink  <br/>\ntogether, and we still have them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Still I can&#39;t help feeling that feeling of dishonesty when  <br/>\nsomething is overtly &quot;teacherly&quot;. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think unschooled kids have the same responses to &quot;teacherly&quot;  <br/>\nas those of us who were teachered nearly to death, though.

A few years ago, my mom bought<br/>\nan online subscription to a reading game thing.  We checked it out and<br/>\ndecided that we probably wouldn&#39;t use it and told her to get her money<br/>\nback because it was really expensive.  I had to finally convince my dad<br/>\nto return it since I knew his frugality would win out over my mom&#39;s<br/>\nstubborn insistence on the value of learning how to read through an<br/>\nonline education game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe games were fun and the graphics were cool, but at the time my<br/>\ndaughter was more into playing toontown and would hands down choose to<br/>\nplay toontown over the reading games.  My mother had purchased it<br/>\nbecause I had been telling her about how much Chamille was learning how<br/>\nto read by playing toontown.  In her mind, she made the connection of<br/>\nlearning how to read through online game play and thought it would be a<br/>\ngood way to help Chamille along in her reading acquisition.  So while it<br/>\nwas a generous offer, it was meant to replace toontown with something<br/>\ngeared specifically towards learning how to read.  Toontown was a fun<br/>\ngame that we all enjoyed with the side effect of learning how to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Chamille had been totally into the reading games, we surely would&#39;ve<br/>\naccepted the generous gift and played the fun games.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -=-I&#39;ve been guilty of doing the creative teaching thing.

Good thing it wasn&#39;t on<br/>\nlearn nothing day!  I think, for me, it goes back to when I was teaching<br/>\ndance classes at preschools.  They wanted me to  include adding and<br/>\nsubtracting and the alphabet and all that.  I wanted to teach dance.  I<br/>\nwas able to do what they asked, but it felt deceptive to dance about the<br/>\nalphabet and jump 3 + 3.  As if there is something inherintly not<br/>\nvaluable about dance in and of itself, and that somehow because dance<br/>\nwas fun and enjoyable, &quot;hey why not teach something at the same time&quot;,<br/>\nbecause kids learn better when they are having fun.  My own thinking<br/>\nwas, &quot;why can&#39;t the kids learn about how their body moves, why can&#39;t<br/>\nthat be as valuable as learning the alphabet?&quot;.  That isn&#39;t the way our<br/>\nculture thinks.  The arts are marginalized, not valuable in and of<br/>\nthemselves, but somehow we can use the arts to teach math and reading<br/>\nand and and .... whatever else might be on the benchmark tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact the local arts charter school uses that very logic to get<br/>\nparents to send their kids to the arts school.  See, they can learn how<br/>\nto dance which is something they want to do, but the parents can rest<br/>\nassured knowing that their kids will be learning about math through the<br/>\nangles of the bodies and the trajectory of the jump, etc.  GAG!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think about all those poor kids that I helped to corrupt in how they<br/>\nviewed dance.  Okay, I do feel guilty of that!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -=-I don&#39;t want all those fun learning moments to be contrived<br/>\n&gt; teachable moments. I could easily go there, I&#39;ve done it, and I avoid<br/>\n&gt; it because I know I go there.-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maybe you should go there with a new confidence and let it turn<br/>\n&gt; heavily educational or not. Moments when kids really want to know<br/>\n&gt; something WILL start coming very naturally when the mom stops<br/>\n&gt; counting, sorting, agonizing and second guessing. Learn to be the<br/>\n&gt; same calm way whether you&#39;re watching poop jokes or a presidential<br/>\n&gt; funeral. That&#39;s progress. &lt;g&gt; (And then if your kid&#39;s depressed,<br/>\n&gt; avoid watching the funeral, but I think that topic is on another<br/>\n&gt; list...)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe.  Knowing the difference helps, knowing that distinction helps. <br/>\nKnowing that its all opportunity for learning helps.  Still I can&#39;t help<br/>\nfeeling that feeling of dishonesty when something is overtly<br/>\n&quot;teacherly&quot;.  It gives me a feeling of being dishonest and perhaps that<br/>\nis where I should dig deeper.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took a lot of thought to let go of learning objectives and to stop<br/>\nviewing the world in that manner that school holds in such high regard. <br/>\nI see my kids for who they are, not what they know, however what they<br/>\nknow is cool and ever expanding, largely because we don&#39;t squash it or<br/>\nplace values on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Kelly Lovejoy described this pretty well. But when someone hasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; really started unschooling yet because there&#39;s no agreement, then<br/>\n&gt; doing educational things that are also fun is just fine. If someone<br/>\n&gt; really wants to move toward unschooling fully, they might want to<br/>\n&gt; change the way they see things and move away from the known-to-be-<br/>\n&gt; educational materials.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, this is something that I used to do, mostly to quell the doubts of<br/>\nothers, including my husband.

At some point<br/>\nvery early on, I decided that there were better ways.  It felt deceptive<br/>\nto me.  My kids like all kinds of games, especially my youngest, and<br/>\nshe&#39;d probably play educational games disguised as &quot;just another fun<br/>\ngame&quot;.  Playing with sticky notes are fun, playing jumping challenges<br/>\nare fun.  All of those things can be really fun.  My objection, in<br/>\ngeneral, is that kids like all these fun things, and adults take these<br/>\nfun things and turn them into &quot;teaching&quot; moments.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree about bringing things in, and showing things to kids, and giving<br/>\nkids ideas and opportunities that they otherwise wouldn&#39;t know existed. <br/>\nThat is largely what we do at our house.  If the whole wide world is for<br/>\nlearning from and exploring, then I&#39;ll try my very best to bring as much<br/>\nof that to them, or them to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see homeschool moms spend loads of time making all that teaching<br/>\nmaterial &quot;fun&quot;, when really the kids just want to play.

My son just loves games and is always trying to get people to play with him. He is also a fencer and is going to be fencing at Nationals in another week. He is so excited. He loves board games, computer games, sports, logic puzzles, etc. I said he loves sports, but only ones that are games. Is isn&#39;t the competition that he likes but the rules. I hate playing board games and would rather hike than do a sports game any day. Watching sports is torture for me. Any time that I can find games that are fun for he and I to do together, it is a big plus. It is not that I am trying to disguise learning as games but that all he wants to do is &quot;play games&quot;. Except reading. He loves to read now and it gives me a break when there aren&#39;t others around for him to play games with. <br/>\n<br/>\nSummer is bliss for him since he can do baseball, soccer, fencing, flag football and all his favorites. During the school year, he can only do sports after school or some rare homeschool sports activities during the day. Rather than homeschooling, he would much rather be at a school that had sports and games all day. Groups of kids with sports and games to choose from going from one activity to another. That is his idea of unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the logic puzzles and paper and pencil games that we do together in the winter are our compromise for the fact that he can&#39;t play flag football in our living room with 5-13 other kids. He has learned to make games out of going to stores, riding in the car, hiking, even brushing his teeth. <br/>\n<br/>\nPreventing him from turning everything that he wants to do or learn into a game would be on my list of &quot;how not to unschool&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nJae<br/>\nRedmond, WA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Jenny C <br/>\nSent: Wednesday, June 25, 2008 11:39 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Teaching how to read<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We started off playing fun games like labeling items in the house with<br/>\n </span></blockquote>their names on sticky notes and then matching the names to cards.<br/>\n<br/>\nGames are fun for sure and I&#39;m sure your kids liked them, but I&#39;m just<br/>\ngoing to put this out there...<br/>\n<br/>\nIf games are being played with the idea that you are secretly inserting<br/>\nknowledge into them, then you are doing nothing more than being a<br/>\ncreative teacher.

He quickly took over <br/>\nfiguring out how they were spelled.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the course of months he noticed that he could figure out a lot <br/>\nof words on signs and such and then an occasional frame in a comic <br/>\nstrip.

Phonics is but one<br/>\nmethod of teaching reading to kids, and it&#39;s relatively new in the whole<br/>\nscheme of things.  Personally, I think phonics does a lot of damage to<br/>\nholistic reading.  When a kid learns how to read naturally, in their own<br/>\nway and their own time, they are also learning how to spell, how to put<br/>\nsentences together, how to use puncutation, how to put words together. <br/>\nPhonics takes one little aspect of reading, called sounding out words,<br/>\nand calls it reading.  Kids that I&#39;ve known that learned how to read<br/>\nusing phonics, have terrible spelling, and their spelling instinct is to<br/>\nspell phonetically, which,within the english language, doesn&#39;t work most<br/>\nof the time.  I think phonics does a terrible disservice to kids in many<br/>\nmany ways!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;...so I decided to leave it alone at least until this year when she<br/>\nwill be in kindergartner, but a few months ago she started to read 3<br/>\nletter words all by herself, it seem to be that some kids learn certain<br/>\nthings when they feel like at least that is the way my daughter learn so<br/>\nI will just follow her clues and let her thrive at her own pace.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy leave it along until this year, why not leave it alone for good?! <br/>\nIf your child is reading three letter words, then she&#39;s reading three<br/>\nletter words.  Let it go, breathe, stop worrying about the big hairy<br/>\nsubject of READING.  So, yes, follow her clues and let her thrive at her<br/>\nown pace.

Over the course of years she would<br/>\nperiodically want me to teach her how to read.  All of the books and<br/>\nworkbooks geared toward teaching reading are soooooo boring that my<br/>\ndaughter would toss the idea after a few minutes of some odd lesson or<br/>\nother.  We found that it was simply better to read to her, listen to<br/>\nbooks on tape/cd and play video games and such.<br/>\n<br/>\nI explained to her at the time that just because you sit down with<br/>\nlessons and workbooks like they do in school, doesn&#39;t mean you will<br/>\nmagically figure it out.  It takes time and kids who do it with lessons<br/>\nand workbooks are just memorizing and repeating things until they know<br/>\nthem, and they do it everyday for long periods of time.  I think because<br/>\nshe saw that to be true, she decided that other things were more<br/>\nimportant to do with her time.  It really seems a waste of time when a<br/>\nkid will figure it out anyway, eventually on their own terms in their<br/>\nown time, in their own way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are games you could play in the meantime that have a lot of words,<br/>\nor you could write notes to him.  Something we did, was put the name of<br/>\nthings all over the house on little pieces of paper.  There were labels<br/>\nfor everything in our bathroom for a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest daughter attributes learning to read with playing toontown. <br/>\nShe says that it was the single most important thing she did that helped<br/>\nher really learn to read and remember words.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":327905838,"authorName":"hollywoodapi","from":"&quot;hollywoodapi&quot; &lt;anna@...&gt;","profile":"hollywoodapi","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Teaching how to read","postDate":"1214405662","msgId":35775,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGczdG02dStlcDN0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTEyNC1EUzRCQURCQjlGOUQ0MTlCNzNEQTNCQ0Q4QTAwQHBoeC5nYmw+"},"prevInTopic":35773,"nextInTopic":35796,"prevInTime":35774,"nextInTime":35776,"topicId":35760,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Jae, These ideas sound great!
