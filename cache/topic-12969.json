Quentin is 7<br/>\nand Sierra is 4.  We&#39;ve been unschooling since May<br/>\n2000 when we &quot;discovered&quot; it at an unschooling<br/>\nconference in TX.  It changed our life.<br/>\n<br/>\nour weekend in tucson:<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was actually HOT here last week.  I even packed up<br/>\nour winter sweaters.  Felt a little foolish<br/>\nremembering that we were complaining about the cold<br/>\njust the week before at the park.   So we are glad for<br/>\nsome more rain today.  It is supposed to be COLD again<br/>\nstarting tomorrow [for those of you who live where it<br/>\nactually GETS cold, I should clarify that this means<br/>\nbelow 65F LOL] & lasting all week.  I think we&#39;ll<br/>\nappreciate it a little more this time around.  Maybe<br/>\nwe&#39;ll get another chance to drive up the mountain and<br/>\nplay in the snow.  Chris & Sierra are both sick, so<br/>\nwe&#39;d have to get them well first.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday, I took the kids to the Buenos Aires<br/>\nNational Wildlife Refuge, which we had never been to<br/>\nbefore.  It was about an hour drive south, to almost<br/>\nMexico (really!).  They were celebrating the 100th<br/>\nbirthday of the National Wildlife Refuge system & it<br/>\nwas so much fun.  Lot of stuff for the kids - they got<br/>\nto pet snakes & a skink & see a legless lizard from<br/>\nthe phoenix zoo & color bat masks & make butterfly<br/>\nrings & clay tablet etchings.  I imagined us taking<br/>\nlittle hikes around the preserve to see birds &<br/>\ncreatures (we all had our binoculars), but we never<br/>\ngot around to doing any actual hiking.  We did manage<br/>\nto get 3 helium balloons, one which made it all the<br/>\nway back to our home in Tucson intact!  On the way<br/>\nhome, Quentin asked if we could go again next year.  I<br/>\nsaid sure! (maybe they&#39;ll have a 101 celebration?)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we got home Quentin&#39;s friend, Stephanie, came<br/>\nover to play.  Actually she got there before we did,<br/>\nbecause it took me 2 hours to get home from the<br/>\nrefuge, although it only took 1 hr to get there.  The<br/>\npolice had roads closed so I kept trying different<br/>\nroutes, which were also closed.  It was very<br/>\nirritating.  Chris finally found the news - a guy was<br/>\nbarricaded in his apt (apparently with a gun?) and<br/>\npolice had evacuated the entire area.  Which wasn&#39;t<br/>\nnear our home, but I needed to drive by the apts to<br/>\nget home.  So we did finally make it home (big sigh of<br/>\nrelief) & the kids played.  Stephanie&#39;s parents &<br/>\nlittle sister rode their bike (singular) by later &<br/>\nChris & I tried out their tandem bike.  It was cool,<br/>\nexcept Chris was in front so all I could see was his<br/>\nback which was weird.  Later we drove over to see<br/>\ntheir new home which they are moving into next<br/>\nweekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nI helped teach &quot;Moses & the Burning Bush&quot; to the kids<br/>\nat church (UU) this morning & then I took Quentin &<br/>\nSierra to the Tucson Art Museum for Family art day. <br/>\nIt was the 1st time we&#39;d been & it was fun too<br/>\n(mostly).   There was a little tour with the guide<br/>\ntelling us & the other families a little about the<br/>\nfeatured artist & she got the kids to participate by<br/>\nasking what things they saw in his abstract paintings,<br/>\netc.  Sierra liked to jump up & contribute something<br/>\neach time LOL  She pointed out a person&#39;s body and a<br/>\nsquare shape.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, Sierra was mostly interested in running down<br/>\nhe loooooooong ramps that go down the center of the<br/>\nmuseum, so I&#39;d have to hike down the loooong ramps &<br/>\nwalk her back up (several times). Then we did family<br/>\npoems based on paintings, which turned out better than<br/>\nyou might have expected.  Then we had to run through<br/>\nthe rain to the next building for snack time.  Which<br/>\nwas a big hit with my kids - running in the rain<br/>\nfollowed by cookies & soda & pretzels.  Then each<br/>\nfamily did a family art project based on the art we<br/>\nhad seen.  We had a giant board onto which we glued<br/>\nplastic bags, sign vinyl, popsicle sticks, cloth,<br/>\ncardboard, etc.  Then we got to carry our creations<br/>\ninto the next room & paint the whole thing.  Quentin<br/>\nwants to know where we are going to hang ours up LOL. <br/>\nIt is covering about half of our kitchen table at the<br/>\nmoment.<br/>\n<br/>\nLets see, after the museum event, we went to Luby&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had bribed Sierra after one of our long ramp<br/>\nexcursions that if she would behave I would let her<br/>\npick a place for lunch afterwards.  She&#39;s her father&#39;s<br/>\ndaughter.  She picked Luby&#39;s.  Quentin & I tried to<br/>\ntalk her out of it because it is on the other side of<br/>\ntown, but to no avail.  We did bring Chris a roast<br/>\nbeef dinner to his great delight.<br/>\n<br/>\nTonight Quentin & I went to a local peace vigil and<br/>\nheld candles in the dark from 7 - 8 p.m. with a lot of<br/>\nother folks, many from our church.  He loved it. I was<br/>\nactually thinking about skipping it, because I was<br/>\ntired, but then he came in & asked if kids were<br/>\nallowed to go.  I was surprised, because when I had<br/>\ndiscussed it earlier in the day, he pronounced it<br/>\nwould be &quot;BORING&quot;.  [He had participated once last<br/>\nfall at a vigil at the local mosque which was getting<br/>\nlots of hate press & mail after 9-11.]  Quentin  was<br/>\nfascinated with watching the candles burn.  He liked<br/>\nblowing it out & re-lighting it.  We had little paper<br/>\ncups around the flame to prevent the wind from blowing<br/>\nthem out.  At one point, he was trying to get the<br/>\nsmoke to &quot;go the other way&quot; and his cup caught fire &<br/>\nit started a huge blaze.   So I had him drop it on the<br/>\nbricks & he sat down & was mesmerized with the burning<br/>\ncup & the melting candle and it took quite awhile for<br/>\nthe whole thing to disappear.<br/>\n <br/>\nNow we are home.  Chris & Sierra are sleeping in the<br/>\nmaster bedroom.  Quentin is building K&#39;nex creations -<br/>\n6-shooter spaceships & things.  While I&#39;m getting to<br/>\nwrite a few emails :)<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n Happy st. patricks&#39;s day,<br/>\n heather in tucson az<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
