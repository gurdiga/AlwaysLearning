I have four children - 11,10,3 and 18 months.  My youngest very much needs me 24/7 as you would expect - I can&#39;t leave a room without her and she is pretty much physically attached to me 90% of the time.

If he doesn&#39;t get it then I believe he expresses his sadness about that by displaying destructive and unpleasant behaviour.   What he wants is for me to watch his shows with him, play his video games, card games and wrestle with him.  I do all these things regularly as much as I can throughout the day and I absolutely love these moments and wish I could do them more, but they are just &#39;moments&#39; and never long enough for him as my two younger children tend to &#39;get in the way&#39;. It is frustrating for him and I totally understand but what can I do?
