Something about it &#39;tricks&#39; the <br/>\ncomputer into thinking there&#39;s more space for saving stuff, etc.  At least, <br/>\nthat&#39;s what my husband (computer geek) told me when I inherited one of his <br/>\nold partitioned hard drives.  Our new one has so much room, he doesn&#39;t do <br/>\nit anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\n(think of it as folding a paper in half so you can make 4 paper-length <br/>\nlists instead of only two.  The paper is useable space on the hard drive <br/>\nand the lists are the stuff you&#39;re storing.)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust use it as if it really has two hard drives instead of only one.  It <br/>\nacts just the same.  Or is yours telling you that it&#39;s partitioned, but not <br/>\nthat it&#39;s two hard drives?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no idea where online you&#39;d get info on computer geekiness.  I&#39;ve <br/>\nfound it&#39;s best to just hang around the geeks themselves and stuff sort of <br/>\nrubs off (once they stop talking about things like BUSes and RAM...)<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidiWD</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16274,"nextTopicId":16286}}
