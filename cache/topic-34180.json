There isn&#39;t any actual study referenced here that shows in <br/>\nany way shape or form that co-sleeping causes children to sleep less <br/>\nor that co-sleeping leads to any sleep-related issues.  The article, <br/>\nthrough it&#39;s poor construction, tries to leave readers with that <br/>\nimpression, but nothing here justifies that notion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would have to dig up some of the research I did when my son was <br/>\nborn (proud co-sleepers until my son was 5 and my daughter was 3, and <br/>\nthen they asked for their own rooms).  But some of the research I <br/>\nremember showed that infants who co-sleep and breast feed (the <br/>\nnatural human manner of being with infants) had much higher levels of <br/>\nbrain activity while they slept.  They slept lighter, true, but while <br/>\nsleeping they were in fact learning!  They react to the sounds and <br/>\nsmells of the mother, and even in sleep interact with her body all <br/>\nnight.  Infants sleeping alone in fact go into such deep brain <br/>\nshutdown that they are nearly in a coma, with very little brain wave <br/>\nactivity.  Which makes sense - infants left alone go into a kind of <br/>\nhibernation, shutting down all but essential bodily functions in <br/>\norder to conserve energy.  Infants sleeping skin to skin with their <br/>\nmothers is the natural way for infants to live in the world, and I <br/>\nthink the scienfitic literature, if looked at in total and <br/>\nobjectively, makes a strong case that this is the optimal arrangement <br/>\nfor infants.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the studies can&#39;t distinguish between quality of sleep and only <br/>\nmeasure it in terms of hours.  An infant is built by nature to sleep <br/>\nlightly, to wake frequently to nurse, and to interact with the mother <br/>\ncontinually (even their temperature regulates through contact with <br/>\nthe mother&#39;s skin).  It&#39;s probably why several studies have showed a <br/>\n10 point IQ improvement for co-sleeping infants.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe insistence that infants and toddlers and children sleep alone is <br/>\ncompletely cultural, not grounded in science (regardless of how many <br/>\nstudies they toss out) and, to my mind, one more horrible thing done <br/>\nto children.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe still sleep very flexibly.  I never know who will end up sleeping <br/>\nwhere, or waking where despite where they fell asleep.  Now that my <br/>\nson and daughter are older and spend most nights in their own beds, I <br/>\nfind that I miss them terribly.  I wouldn&#39;t trade the way we slept <br/>\nfor anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, ENSEMBLE S-WAYNFORTH <br/>\n&lt;s.waynforth@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dr. James McKenna at Northwestern University has a great website <br/>\n </span></blockquote>for his sleep labs: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nd.edu/~jmckenn1/lab/.\">http://www.nd.edu/~jmckenn1/lab/.</a> Dr. Helen Ball <br/>\nat the University Durham as a sleep-lab as well and a website: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dur.ac.uk/sleep.lab/projects/.\">http://www.dur.ac.uk/sleep.lab/projects/.</a> Dr. Carol Wortham at Emory <br/>\nUniversity has a great paper on sleep at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/6yyvdc.\">http://tinyurl.com/6yyvdc.</a> <br/>\nIt talks about the contexts in which humans sleep.

Safety concerns not<br/>\nonly macropredators such as lions or human enemies, but also buffering<br/>\nelements, protection from micropredators such as mosquitoes, and general<br/>\nreduction of external disturbance and predation risk. Safety also inheres<br/>\nin membership in a well-functioning social group that frames and<br/>\npopulates the context for sleep. Shelter for and accoutrements of sleep<br/>\ndefine its physical microenvironment. Moreover, the diurnal patterning<br/>\nof sleep is influenced by a set of structural and cultural features operating<br/>\nvariably across the life course, including labor demands, schedules<br/>\nof social and ritual activity, status and role differentiation, and beliefs<br/>\nabout the nature and functions of sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nI liked the line &quot;A solitary, unprotected, and unequipped sleeper is an aberration; for humans, sleep is embedded in behaviourally, socially, and culturally constituted environments enabling safe sleep. <br/>\n<br/>\nI found that article hard to read. And the term self-soothe disturbs at a level I can&#39;t even begin to not vent about it. David, my husband, has a paper on co-sleeping and stress in children.

Here is the link:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1728755,00.html\">http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1728755,00.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSince my daughter is only 21 months this is definitely one of the most<br/>\nrelevant examples that I could add to this discussion. This article is<br/>\nabout a study and how children should not sleep with their parents --<br/>\nthat they should learn to sleep on their own. Well, my SIL knows that<br/>\nour daughter sleeps with us (and still nurses). So I&#39;m not sure if she<br/>\nthinks that sending this article will make us want to change how we do<br/>\nthings or what. I&#39;m sure that if we brought it up to her she would<br/>\ntell us she was trying to help us because the article says that doing<br/>\nthese things (sleeping with your child) can cause health problems<br/>\nlater on. Whether it is true that she wants to help us, and/or how<br/>\nmuch she wants proof that their ways of doing things with their son<br/>\n(our nephew)are better, only she can know. What I do know is that<br/>\nsince my daughter has been born we have been working on finding the<br/>\npath that is right for our family. Part of that for me is to stop<br/>\nworrying about what other people think - including family. I find that<br/>\nI often feel I&#39;m doing better about this (especially when we don&#39;t see<br/>\nthem!) but that I take steps backwards when I do have contact with<br/>\npeople that I perceive as questioning me (even if they aren&#39;t openly).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, I also wondered what is my best way of doing more research<br/>\nabout studies like this one? It makes me sad to think that more people<br/>\nwho might consider and enjoy sleeping with their children will be<br/>\ndiscouraged by another &quot;expert&quot; opinion. Even after reading the<br/>\narticle I could start to think of some ways that the study might not<br/>\nbe credible. But I thought I would throw it out to some of you who<br/>\nmight have more insight and experience dissecting studies.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34169,"nextTopicId":34184}}
