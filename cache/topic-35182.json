They might have some  <br/>\n&gt; additional subcategories like &quot;demanding&quot; and &quot;responsive.&#39; So you  <br/>\n&gt; have each parent identified this way -  they might be indulgent and  <br/>\n&gt; responsive or authoritative and responsive, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>All subjective concepts to begin with and impossible to quantify in<br/>\nany truly meaningful way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then they do the same with the kids. They come up with a bunch of  <br/>\n&gt; categories (i.e., school outcomes, social interaction competence,  <br/>\n&gt; happiness/depression) - they give each kid a score in each category.  <br/>\n&gt; They CHOOSE the categories, they define them and decide what gets a  <br/>\n&gt; kid a high score and what gives a low score.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then they use snazzy statistical techniques to find correlations  <br/>\n&gt; between the parental categories and the kid categories.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Perceived patterns, like inkblot butterflies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please notice that it ALL depends on how they set up the studies in  <br/>\n&gt; the first place. The way they are typically set up, the vast majority  <br/>\n&gt; of parents are authoritative - and within that very large group, they  <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t find parenting matters much. That&#39;s because they&#39;re lumping  <br/>\n&gt; together way too many different kinds of parenting -  because the  <br/>\n&gt; differences are in hard-to-nail-down, hard-to-observe, hard-to-ask-the- <br/>\n&gt; right-question-about, aspects of parenting. Do they (are they even  <br/>\n&gt; able to) look at how supportive a parent is, how in-tune with a child,  <br/>\n&gt; how thoughtful of children&#39;s needs, how good a parent is in helping a  <br/>\n&gt; child learn to navigate the world, and on and on. And, the categories  <br/>\n&gt; for the kids are likely to be completely ignoring things that are very  <br/>\n&gt; important to some of us. They ask, for example, kids and parents (and  <br/>\n&gt; sometimes teachers) to rate kids on their &quot;competency&quot; levels - how  <br/>\n&gt; well do they follow instructions, how well do they behave in class,  <br/>\n&gt; how well do they get along with peers. And &quot;problems in school?&quot; Well,  <br/>\n&gt; yeah, reading later is a big problem. Do we care? Not if they don&#39;t GO  <br/>\n&gt; to school!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Turns out, within that big authoritative group, there isn&#39;t much  <br/>\n&gt; correlation found between parenting behaviors and child-outcomes. Not  <br/>\n&gt; actually surprising at all. It is a statistical muddle, not a real- <br/>\n&gt; life parenting muddle.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -pam<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>IMNSHO, much of what&#39;s generally referred to as Social Science (an<br/>\noxymoron if ever there was one) is a form of self-fulfilling prophecy.<br/>\nResearchers into human behaviour see what they want to see based on<br/>\ntheir personal experiences in the world and, though they may use the<br/>\nscientific method as a template, they create the details of their<br/>\nresearch criteria according to what they set out to find. Not<br/>\nnecessarily at a conscious level or deliberately (although that does<br/>\nhappen), but because they&#39;re humans too and objectivity is an<br/>\nimpossibility when humans study the behaviour of other humans.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d be interested to know how many parents were involved in the<br/>\nresearch that produced the observation made by the author of the book.<br/>\nI remember having a pop at a social &#39;scientist&#39; one time for<br/>\npublishing a sweeping pronouncement on human behaviour generally that<br/>\nwas totally at odds with my real life experience and turned out to be<br/>\nbased on her study of the behaviour of just 19 people. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat kind of nonsense isn&#39;t rare. Another time, I had a social<br/>\nscientist tell me that her research had shown mothers who have a full<br/>\ntime job outside the home spend as much time with their children over<br/>\nthe course of a week as mothers who stay at home full time. That was<br/>\nbased on a study of just a few hundred mothers with no indication<br/>\ngiven as to what the selection process was or what the research<br/>\ncriteria were. I told her her results seemed to me like something that<br/>\nhad come out of the back end of a certain farm animal. Naughty me. So<br/>\npetulant and rude at times.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, the fact is, I&#39;m totally cynical about social &#39;science&#39; (which it<br/>\nisn&#39;t) and statistics generally. They can be used to &#39;prove&#39; anything<br/>\nyou want to prove. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen there was that classic headline in a national newspaper here a<br/>\nfew years ago, &quot;75% of Australians don&#39;t want Charles as the next King<br/>\nof Australia&quot; (the Queen of England is still, on paper, the Head of<br/>\nState of Australia, and the belief is that Charles should be bypassed<br/>\nwhen the time comes in favour of Prince William because he&#39;s more in<br/>\ntouch with &#39;the people&#39; in today&#39;s world). So, &quot;75% of Australians&quot; is<br/>\nabout 15 million people, right? Hmm... I didn&#39;t see any notification<br/>\nof a referendum in the media. No. It&#39;s 75% of the little more than 300<br/>\nAustralians living in the same part of the country as the research<br/>\ncompany who were asked a predesignated question and were deemed, we<br/>\nknow not how, to be &quot;statistically representative&quot; of the entire<br/>\npopulation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Ebeneezer Scrooge would say, &quot;Humbug&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nBob</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: no impact?","postDate":"1212619728","msgId":35237,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGcyNzY0ZytpdjR0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDA2MDQyMDA4MTE0Mi4xOTA5OC40ODQ2N0ZBNDAwMDlFN0FFMDAwMDRBOUEyMjIxODY3NTE2OUIwQTAyRDIwODlCOUEwMTlDMDQwNDBBMERCRjk3MDg5QjBFMDU5NzBBMDIwQjAxOURAYXR0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":35236,"nextInTopic":35263,"prevInTime":35236,"nextInTime":35238,"topicId":35182,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... helpful and clearly written.

I thought a lot about that when I first read it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe surprising to her? First of all, &quot;little impact&quot; doesn&#39;t mean  <br/>\n&quot;no impact&quot; For example, just a little more likely for children to be  <br/>\ndepressed? Is that okay?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I think she&#39;s wrong. I think her conclusion is based on  <br/>\nstatistical research and what the research REALLY shows is that it is  <br/>\nvery difficult to nail down differences in parenting other than the  <br/>\nextremes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way the studies work is that they take a large group of parents  <br/>\nand kids and they either observe them directly (in natural settings or  <br/>\nin labs) and/or they &quot;survey&quot; them - ask them lots of questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey come up with parenting style categories - usually authoritarian,  <br/>\nauthoritative, indulgent, and neglectful. They might have some  <br/>\nadditional subcategories like &quot;demanding&quot; and &quot;responsive.&#39; So you  <br/>\nhave each parent identified this way -  they might be indulgent and  <br/>\nresponsive or authoritative and responsive, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen they do the same with the kids. They come up with a bunch of  <br/>\ncategories (i.e., school outcomes, social interaction competence,  <br/>\nhappiness/depression) - they give each kid a score in each category.  <br/>\nThey CHOOSE the categories, they define them and decide what gets a  <br/>\nkid a high score and what gives a low score.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen they use snazzy statistical techniques to find correlations  <br/>\nbetween the parental categories and the kid categories.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease notice that it ALL depends on how they set up the studies in  <br/>\nthe first place. The way they are typically set up, the vast majority  <br/>\nof parents are authoritative - and within that very large group, they  <br/>\ndon&#39;t find parenting matters much. That&#39;s because they&#39;re lumping  <br/>\ntogether way too many different kinds of parenting -  because the  <br/>\ndifferences are in hard-to-nail-down, hard-to-observe, hard-to-ask-the- <br/>\nright-question-about, aspects of parenting. Do they (are they even  <br/>\nable to) look at how supportive a parent is, how in-tune with a child,  <br/>\nhow thoughtful of children&#39;s needs, how good a parent is in helping a  <br/>\nchild learn to navigate the world, and on and on. And, the categories  <br/>\nfor the kids are likely to be completely ignoring things that are very  <br/>\nimportant to some of us. They ask, for example, kids and parents (and  <br/>\nsometimes teachers) to rate kids on their &quot;competency&quot; levels - how  <br/>\nwell do they follow instructions, how well do they behave in class,  <br/>\nhow well do they get along with peers. And &quot;problems in school?&quot; Well,  <br/>\nyeah, reading later is a big problem. Do we care? Not if they don&#39;t GO  <br/>\nto school!<br/>\n<br/>\nTurns out, within that big authoritative group, there isn&#39;t much  <br/>\ncorrelation found between parenting behaviors and child-outcomes. Not  <br/>\nactually surprising at all. It is a statistical muddle, not a real- <br/>\nlife parenting muddle.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":211613982,"authorName":"Margaret","from":"Margaret &lt;margaretz@...&gt;","profile":"margaretzat","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] no impact?","postDate":"1212601589","msgId":35230,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlmNzJkNzYyMDgwNjA0MTA0Nm4xOWJkMzlhM2kxZmQ1OGEzODExOGYwMWQ2QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDA2MDQyMDA4MTE0Mi4xOTA5OC40ODQ2N0ZBNDAwMDlFN0FFMDAwMDRBOUEyMjIxODY3NTE2OUIwQTAyRDIwODlCOUEwMTlDMDQwNDBBMERCRjk3MDg5QjBFMDU5NzBBMDIwQjAxOURAYXR0Lm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDA2MDMyMDA4MjI1OS42Nzc2LjQ4NDVDQ0VEMDAwMTBEMzAwMDAwMUE3ODIyMjE4Njc1MTY5QjBBMDJEMjA4OUI5QTAxOUMwNDA0MEEwREJGOTcwODlCMEUwNTk3MEEwMjBCMDE5REBhdHQubmV0PgkgPGcyNHN1NytrcWlyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgkgPDA2MDQyMDA4MTE0Mi4xOTA5OC40ODQ2N0ZBNDAwMDlFN0FFMDAwMDRBOUEyMjIxODY3NTE2OUIwQTAyRDIwODlCOUEwMTlDMDQwNDBBMERCRjk3MDg5QjBFMDU5NzBBMDIwQjAxOURAYXR0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":35225,"nextInTopic":35231,"prevInTime":35229,"nextInTime":35231,"topicId":35182,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m guessing that means: It s not your fault.

I was comparing the  <br/>\nbehavior to that of toddlers, that the more supported they feel, the  <br/>\nmore brave they can be, but not saying the mom should talk about  <br/>\nmissing his toddlerhood. Not at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as far as sentimentality goes - that might depend on the kid. Some  <br/>\nmight actually appreciate a mom expressing out loud the kind of  <br/>\nambivalent, sweet/sad sentiments that a kid might be feeling a bit of,  <br/>\ntoo. Maybe not most guys, but maybe some. A little would go a long way  <br/>\n- and for some kids it might be awful. I only have girls, myself, but  <br/>\nwatched closely as my sister&#39;s boys (now 29 and 26) left home. One of  <br/>\nthem is a very &quot;mushy&quot; kind of guy - cuddly, still. The other a bit  <br/>\nmore macho-like, I guess. But I remember my sister noting back then  <br/>\nthat she felt it was important for her not to stop hugging them,  <br/>\ntouching them on the arm when speaking, looking directly into their  <br/>\neyes, speaking opening about how much she liked them. Since then, I&#39;ve  <br/>\nnoticed that lots of moms seem to withdraw from closeness - physical  <br/>\nand emotional - with their sons when they get big and manly. I&#39;m  <br/>\nthinking maybe they might do it too abruptly - too much withdrawal,  <br/>\ntoo soon. So - for this particular case - a 15 yo with a 9 yo brother  <br/>\n- maybe the jealousy is about the younger brother still getting all  <br/>\nkinds of loving attention, while the older one is feeling mom is, if  <br/>\nnot pushing him away, going along a bit too eagerly with his pushing  <br/>\naway himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nA 15 yo probably doesn&#39;t want the kind of loving attention a 9 yo  <br/>\nwants.

I know that my 17 yo daughter still  <br/>\nLOVES to get all mushy and cuddly with me - she&#39;ll hug me and kiss me  <br/>\nand say, &quot;You&#39;re my favorite mommy - I LOOOOVE you.&quot; And I do the same  <br/>\nkind of stuff back. She does seem to be wanting more and more of that  <br/>\nkind of gushy stuff - and I do most definitely have the sense that it  <br/>\nis because she&#39;s having those urges toward independence at the same  <br/>\ntime. She&#39;s doing things like taking the bus places instead of asking  <br/>\nme for rides. And she&#39;s been studying for the drivers license test -  <br/>\nso she&#39;s making those kinds of moves.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":132859234,"authorName":"Paula Sjogerman","from":"Paula Sjogerman &lt;sjogy@...&gt;","profile":"psjogy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] sibling jealousy, caring","postDate":"1212525683","msgId":35203,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRCNkFFRjlCLTUyRjUtNDgyRC05QjE1LTQ5NEE3RjY1RjdDRUBzYmNnbG9iYWwubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDdENDc3QzQxLThDM0ItNDVBRS1CQzAxLTAwQzlBOTg2MTU1OUBtYWMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"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"},"prevInTopic":35201,"nextInTopic":35205,"prevInTime":35202,"nextInTime":35204,"topicId":35182,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It sort of comes and goes, though, during those  <br/>\nyears before the child becomes really ready to go. I&#39;m thinking that  <br/>\nsome parents feel that urge and then that&#39;s it - they start giving off  <br/>\nthe &quot;its time for you to get out and be independent&quot; vibes and that  <br/>\noverrides the &quot;I love the young person you are right now&quot; vibes. And,  <br/>\nthe kid might be feeling the beginning of those &quot;time for me to be  <br/>\nindependent vibes&quot; while, at the same time, that is pretty scary and  <br/>\nhe might need extra amounts of the &quot;I love you and am here for you,&quot;  <br/>\nvibes from his mother.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, that paradox HAS been true for both of my older daughters.  <br/>\nOne is moved out and very independent, and we did occasionally have  <br/>\nmore conflict for a while before she really got moved out on her own.  <br/>\nBut, still, at that exact same time that we were both sensing those  <br/>\npush away feelings, there was a lot of clinginess and holding-on  <br/>\nfeelings, too. Now I&#39;m feeling the same with Roxana, although I a lot  <br/>\nless intensely, much much more calmly, and that&#39;s really a personality  <br/>\ndifference in the kids AND the fact that it is the second time through  <br/>\nit for me. And, Rox isn&#39;t one to act quickly on a feeling so there  <br/>\nisn&#39;t any hurry. When Roya started having those &quot;time to be on my own&quot;  <br/>\nurges - her every nerve ending cried out to totally satisfy that urge  <br/>\nright now! Roxana is happier to satisfy it by being here with us and  <br/>\nmoving gradually toward more independence. Well, and it is helping  <br/>\nthat she just spent 3 months in France, living on her own, so she got  <br/>\na LOT of that urge satisfied in a big way and can relax happily at  <br/>\nhome, now, even though we all know it won&#39;t last forever.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - I&#39;m not saying to try to deny or belittle the &quot;time to be  <br/>\nindependent&quot; feelings.
