I feel as if I will loose my mind if I don&#39;t get one soon. I suffer from emotional abuse from my husband and tho he is a good man in his own way we have grown severally apart. I need to prepare myself in the case that we separate and I do see it coming. He is not involved with my unschooling our two kids at all and has never been. He does his own thing and I am use to that where unschooling is concerned. I have a hard time emotionaly in my relationship with him and that is not where advice is needed. If you do have any tho I would be thankful. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem is that I need a job and ideally it would be from home. I don&#39;t have anyone to care  for my girls while I am away at work. I would love it if they could work on their projects and interest while I worked. If any of you have any ideas for me or any contacts I would very much appreciate it. I am a licensed wedding planner but there isn&#39;t any business in my area for that. I also am an aspiring florist and artist. I am a fast learner and a hard worker.I have already been all over Rat Race Rebellion and WAHM. I dont need anything fancy because I dont have many bills. I have been preparing myself for being on my own with the kids. If you can help me I would appreciate. thank you so much.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47182,"nextTopicId":47175}}
