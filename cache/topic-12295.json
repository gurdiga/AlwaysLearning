It&#39;s <br/>\ncalled &quot;90 years without slumbering,&quot; and is based on the song &quot;My <br/>\nGrandfather&#39;s Clock.&quot;  She likes that song, and she likes Twilight Zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...<br/>\nThe old guy, who&#39;s played by Ed Wynn, known by Holly from Mary Poppins, goes <br/>\nto a psychiatrist.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt some point he says &quot;Do you think I&#39;m crazy?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe doctor hesitated and said &quot;&#39;Crazy&#39; is a big word.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s funny.  <br/>\nIn the 60&#39;s people were really afraid of psychiatry.  Very skeptical.  But <br/>\nthe &quot;right&quot; phrase would have been &quot;schizophrenic is a big word&quot; or some <br/>\nsuch.   &quot;Crazy&quot; isn&#39;t a big word.  Lots of good jokes on Twilight Zone just <br/>\ngo by, since there&#39;s no laugh track, and it&#39;s not usually intended to be <br/>\nfunny anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook what I found!! This kinda follows (in an overkill kind of way &lt;bwg&gt;) a <br/>\nconversation at unschooling-dotcom, but it will be more interesting here.  On <br/>\nsome website someone has annotated this twilight zone episode MUSICALLY.  <br/>\nCheck it out:<br/>\n<br/>\n     R2 M1521 Cue IV[&quot;You Really Believe That?&quot;]Lento in C. 26 bars, 1 <br/>\nminute. <br/>\n                 Scene:At Carol&#39;s suggestion, Sam visits a psychiatrist who <br/>\nasks &quot;You really <br/>\n                 believe that?&quot; when Sam states that if the clock stops, <br/>\nhe&#39;ll die. <br/>\n                 The harp sff is again acciaccatura Bb up to Bb whole note, <br/>\nthen tacet till <br/>\n                 Bar 5. <br/>\n                 The divisi clarinets play ff half note dotted dyad notes <br/>\nD/Ab, repeated <br/>\n                 next bar. The bass clarinet plays E half note dotted, ff &gt; <br/>\nfollowed by a <br/>\n                 quarter rest. After a quartervrest, the vibe plays rising <br/>\nquarter notes Ab, <br/>\n                 Bb, Cb, sounding pp. Repeated next bar. <br/>\n                 In Bar 2, the bass clarinet plays F half note dotted. <br/>\n                 In Bar 3, the clarinets play unison half notes Bb to Ab <br/>\nto(Bar 4)F whole <br/>\n                 note. The bass cl plays half notes D down to C to(Bar 4)Ab. <br/>\nIn Bar 4, after <br/>\n                 a quarter rest, the vibe sounds rising quarter notes Ab, Bb, <br/>\nCb. Etc etc. <br/>\n                 In Bar 10, the cue changes to &quot;Allegretto&quot; in 6/8 time as <br/>\nthe flute and <br/>\n                 oboe are soli playing a cheerful melody. The flute plays <br/>\ndescending <br/>\n                 quasi-triplet notes(D/C/Ab to ascending quasi-triplet <br/>\nF/Ab/C. Repeated <br/>\n                 next bar. Then, in Bar 12, the flute plays quarter note D to <br/>\nEb 8th note, C <br/>\n                 down to Ab 8th note up to(Bar 13)D half note dotted. <br/>\n                 In bar 10, meanwhile, the oboe plays descending <br/>\nquasi-triplet Bb/Ab/F, <br/>\n                 and rising D/F/Ab. Repeated next bar. In Bar 12, the oboe <br/>\nplays Bb quarter <br/>\n                 rinforzando up to C 8th, then Ab quarter down to F 8th up <br/>\nyo(Bar 13)Bb <br/>\n                 half note dotted. <br/>\n                 In Bar 13, the clarinets take over that melody pattern. Etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s just one scene.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.comcen.com.au/~agfam/rundowns/cuetz4.html\">http://www.comcen.com.au/~agfam/rundowns/cuetz4.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12307,"nextTopicId":12305}}
