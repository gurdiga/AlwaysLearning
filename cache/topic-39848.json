Some days I have to tell them &quot;listen, I really need<br/>\nto work, you will have to look after yourselves for a while.&quot; (Today<br/>\nwas one of those days, by the way.) I&#39;d like to say I&#39;m always patient<br/>\nwith them on days like this, but the fact is I&#39;m often feeling grumpy<br/>\nand resentful, and I&#39;m sure it shows. Sometimes I feel like I&#39;m just<br/>\nbeing selfish and neglectful by keeping them at home when I can&#39;t<br/>\ndedicate enough time to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHell, I&#39;ve wanted to post questions or ask for support to unschooling<br/>\nlists at least thirty times in the past two years and haven&#39;t had time<br/>\nto properly formulate them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI should say that I/we do many, many different things with the girls<br/>\n(parks, museums, playing games, gardening, rollerblading/biking,<br/>\nbeach, walks in the woods, looking for creepy crawlies, etc.) so it&#39;s<br/>\nnot a case of my being slothful and uninterested like Harmony&#39;s<br/>\nfriend, but rather the sheer pressure of time and the feeling of not<br/>\nhaving enough to spend with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis September, my partner wanted S to try the small local school in<br/>\nthe village near where we&#39;re building the house (previously she went<br/>\nto preschool in the city). S was very reluctant to go but my partner<br/>\ninsisted, and I felt that, especially as this was an exceptionally<br/>\nbusy time for us, it wouldn&#39;t be such a terrible idea for her to<br/>\nexperience school for a while, mornings only. After struggling for a<br/>\nweek, she turned out to like it, and is actually keen to go most days.<br/>\nThis is very different from our experience with the city school, where<br/>\nshe had to be dragged out of the door. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact Nora, who has to do _everything_ her big sister does (anyone<br/>\nelse have a toddler like that?), is upset because she&#39;s too little to<br/>\ngo to school. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;m now in the position of a passionate advocate of unschooling<br/>\nwith two daughters who actually (in one case, desperately) _want_ to<br/>\ngo to school. <br/>\n<br/>\nI tell myself it&#39;s temporary, this is the best year for her to try<br/>\nschool, next year they start getting heavy with curricula and<br/>\nhomework, by then the house should be nearing completion and I can<br/>\ndevote more time to the girls. But realistically, I know I have other<br/>\nthings that I want to do in life (writing and ecological design are my<br/>\npassions), not all of which can be done with the girls, so I question<br/>\nwhether, even in the hypothetical absence of the need to earn a<br/>\nliving, I would be happy as a full-time unschooling dad.

It&#39;s homeschooling.   <br/>\nFor someone to choose to unschool instead of using a curriculum, she  <br/>\nneeds to REALLY get it.  She needs to understand, herself, what it is  <br/>\nand why and how it works, and then she needs to create an environment  <br/>\nin which is IS working, for sure, for real, right in her house.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s no signing up and then slacking off and then having &quot;the  <br/>\ncompany&quot; or &quot;the tribe&quot; (I don&#39;t like that term at all, but for those  <br/>\nwho use and understand it, this will make sense) or &quot;unschooling  <br/>\nexperts&quot; come and save her or say &quot;Yes, she&#39;s really unschooling and  <br/>\nunschooling works.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it&#39;s more like AA.

There&#39;s  <br/>\ndrinking (with or without AA attendance) and there&#39;s not drinking  <br/>\n(with or without AA).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so someone can be on a list for two years or ten years and still  <br/>\nbe a crappy unschooler (if an unschooler at all).<br/>\nThere  have been cases of people being on this list or others like it  <br/>\nfor years, literally.
