That&#39;s my saying to counter<br/>\nsayings like &quot;don&#39;t offer-don&#39;t refuse&quot; and other ideas we wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nwant leveled at ourselves but that children are often at the mercy of.<br/>\nBe generous. Treat children as special guests and revered friends not<br/>\nadjuncts to or extensions of parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny time this list is about what&#39;s healthy or how much or exactly what<br/>\nto feed children, it&#39;s easy to mix food ideas into the unschooling and<br/>\nmake decisions about eating apply to the unschooling itself. Sometimes<br/>\nthat confuses issues and has readers thinking that decisions about<br/>\neating are decisions about unschooling-- which they are on an<br/>\nindividual level.
