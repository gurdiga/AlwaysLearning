I don&#39;t want to share the e-mail because it has links to stories I&#39;m sure are depressing and unrelated, about video games players dying after playing games for a long time.  For all I know the author is someone&#39;s ex husbandï¿½.   But the subject line was:<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSubject: \tHi, what is your opinion on this matter as a well-known &quot;unschooling&quot; parent? Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd most of the text is quoted:<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Cases like these will instill more fear and paranoia to people who don&#39;t understand the principle of &quot;unschooling&quot; so what is your opinion on the matter and how would you defend your lifestyle from people who would judge you based on news like these?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;m not going to read those articles.<br/>\n<br/>\nI doubt either of them was an unschooler in a home with a loving family where someone was taking him food and drinks, looking over his shoulder and cheering him on.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy volunteer energy is put into helping parents create lives of peaceful learning for their families.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;...a well-known &quot;unschooling&quot; parent?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI AM an unschooling parent, without quotation marks.  I can talk about unschooling and about loving relationships between parents and children.  I have no obligation to address any other topics.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Cases like these will instill more fear and paranoia --=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people like fear and paranoia, and I&#39;m very sorry that it hampers the potential of peaceful realationships between them and their children (between them and anyone, really).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want something to show detractors, here are stories of families (not one child in isolation) enjoying and learning from Minecraft:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/videogames/minecraft\">http://sandradodd.com/videogames/minecraft</a><br/>\nThere are two new links to accounts of other families, and one I&#39;ve had there for a while.  All have this theme, pretty much:  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Long story short, I realized that everytime I rejected his interests I was missing an opportunity to connect with him. And connection became my priority. Even before I understood anything about video games besides my shallow observations and judgements. As soon as I shifted to respect, a whole new world opened for me. I also learned some amazing things about my son.&quot; (Kristiva Stack, from that page)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n===================================<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he writes back, maybe I should point out that I&#39;m sure more people have died immediatly after strenuous exercise than after sitting still, and that there would be a lot more people alive in northern Colorado it that bad guy had spent his time, money and energy on video games than on weapons and a bullet-proof vest.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68254,"nextTopicId":68269}}
