It was about attachment parenting and breastfeeding toddlers. There is a mother from the U.S. who practices elimination communication and two other families (the one from Northumberland, and another family from Washington (or Oregon)) who were both nursing toddlers and who both (I believe) professed to be unschooling. It was a window into the lives of, with narration sort of thing. Not a docudrama. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister-in-law is an editor for television shows. She worked on the first U.S. wife swap series. Her opinion, never do it. At the end of the day the editing is what makes the show and they are editing for trauma not for joy. So, if you were to do it, don&#39;t expect anything but misery and conflict to be portrayed when it airs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Sandra Dodd <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, September 01, 2006 7:56 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] tv programme that mentions unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-Hidden Lives: Honey I Suckle the Kids.
