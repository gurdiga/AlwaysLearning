That was before homeschool.

Soooo I started paying <br/>\nattention to cartoons and watching them.  There are even web sites you <br/>\ncan go on for cartoons that you can all learn from.  That might spark <br/>\nher interest in research. He (our son)just turned 13 and we&#39;ve gone <br/>\nfrom cartoons to monster creepy movies, to history and war movies.  <br/>\nYeah, don&#39;t get all wiggy about cartoons.  That&#39;ll pass.  But DO watch <br/>\nsome with her and try not to compare her w/ brother.  They all need to <br/>\nbe listened too.  Well,  that&#39;s my two bits worth!
