Her theme was Mother Goose stories, <br/>\nwith everyone dressing up as characters from mother goose.  Lexie helped <br/>\nme find books, etc. to help her but was mad that Rita would ask us to <br/>\nhelp and not invite us.  I explained the party was late evening hours, <br/>\nand Lexie reminded me she stays up late constantly.  I reminded Lexie <br/>\nthat it was an adult only party and lexie said that was not fair and <br/>\nthat she was good with adults and could just come for a bit.  I finally <br/>\nsaid &quot;Lexie, it&#39;s for lesbians only.  She does this every year.&quot;  Lexie <br/>\nsaid something about how she might be a lesbian when she grew up and she <br/>\nneeded to have this experience!  LOL.  She didn&#39;t get to go, but let me <br/>\ntell you, Rita and I were sure thinking that if she could argue her <br/>\npoint that well, she should be allowed to go!  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard on kids but you don&#39;t get to go to every party, even to every <br/>\nparty you are invited to.<br/>\n<br/>\njoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In a message dated 12/8/02 5:44:45 AM Central Standard Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; So far<br/>\n&gt; it appears all the kids are getting their needs met.
