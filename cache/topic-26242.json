On the Egyptian chart at the  <br/>\nend, all the multiples of 9 always have the same symbol next to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlgebraically it goes like this ...<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a number looks like ab, it would be represented algebracially as:<br/>\n<br/>\n10*a + b.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for:<br/>\n<br/>\n12 then a=1 and b=2 so 12=10*1 + 2<br/>\n37 then a=3 and b=7 so 37=10*3 + 7<br/>\n82 then a=8 and b=2 so 82=10*8 +2<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the first step of the game they ask you to add a and b together.  <br/>\nAnd then they tell you to subtract that number from the original  <br/>\nnumber. That&#39;s just a way of eliminating the last digit so all  <br/>\nproblems turn into:<br/>\n<br/>\n10*a + b - (a+b)<br/>\n<br/>\nrearranging, you can see that the b part of every 2 digit number gets  <br/>\neliminated:<br/>\n<br/>\n10*a - a + b - b<br/>\n<br/>\nSo all problems turn into either 10-1, 20-2, 30-3, 40-4 ...<br/>\n<br/>\n10*a - a = 9a<br/>\n<br/>\n10*1 - 1 = 9*1 = 9<br/>\n10*2 - 2 = 9*2 = 18<br/>\n10*3 - 3 = 9*3 = 27<br/>\n<br/>\nand so on. So all two digit numbers are turned into 9 times the first  <br/>\ndigit of the number.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":139092405,"authorName":"wenrom31@aol.com","from":"wenrom31@...","profile":"wldr104","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Two fun sites","postDate":"1152472135","msgId":26257,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM3NS42YWQxNmIzLjMxZTJhZTQ3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":26242,"nextInTopic":26258,"prevInTime":26256,"nextInTime":26258,"topicId":26242,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My son (14) asked how this works.
