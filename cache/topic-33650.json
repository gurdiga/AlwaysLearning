I do that a lot. I did it today when David was telling me a good route to walk the dog. I spaced out and started thinking about what to feed Linnaea and her friend and completely didn&#39;t hear the last things he was saying. I apologized and asked him to repeat himself, and he did. I try not to drift away, but when I do, because I really do want to hear what was said, I ask to get the information, or the story, or the request again. <br/>\n<br/>\n================<br/>\nSomething else:<br/>\nOften times when she is playing video games (which she does a lot and that<br/>\nis fine) I will ask her if she wants to do something with her sister and I.<br/>\nShe is of course free to say no and I only ask because Lil and I are already<br/>\ndoing said thing. However, when she wants to do something with me, she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get that I need time to finish up what I am doing to be with her.<br/>\nJust now she said &quot;Let&#39;s go downstairs.&quot; I told her that she could go<br/>\ndownstairs if she wanted to, but I was sewing.<br/>\n<br/>\n=====================<br/>\nWas she alright with your answer. Often if I&#39;m invited to do something with Simon or Linnaea I try and make that a priority over whatever it is I&#39;m doing. If it is something that will only take me a few minutes to complete and I know I&#39;d feel better I&#39;ll ask if they want me now or if I can finish what I&#39;m doing. I figure in not too many years they aren&#39;t going to be inviting me to so many things. It seems like such a gift to be asked to do something now, whatever else can wait. <br/>\n<br/>\n==================<br/>\nApparently she wanted me to go downstairs and play Candy Land with her, but<br/>\nit took me a minute to figure that out. She was on her way downstairs (by<br/>\nherself) when she said &quot;you just get to into your sewing&quot;. Which made me<br/>\nthink of her video games. If I would have known she wanted to go down and<br/>\nplay Candy Land I would have just said &quot;Just a minute, let me finish this<br/>\nup&quot;, but I tried to explain to her that she doesn&#39;t want to do things with<br/>\nme when she is into her video games. I don&#39;t think she completely saw the<br/>\nconnection that I was trying to make and it was probably a bad example<br/>\nanyway because it may have suggested that I didn&#39;t want to go play Candy<br/>\nLand, which wasn&#39;t the case.<br/>\n==================<br/>\n<br/>\nNext time say dang, I want to play Candy Land way more than I want to finish this curtain or skirt or shirt or whatever else it is. Thank you for inviting me. There is no real gain by trying to show her that sometimes she doesn&#39;t do what you invite her to do with you. You don&#39;t really want parity, do you? <br/>\n<br/>\n=========================<br/>\nAlso, another issue we have is when we try to problem solve.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will be talking to her trying to figure out how I can make something<br/>\nbetter (like today with the Candy Land/communication thing, or the other day<br/>\nwhen I was trying to see if there was a way to make baths more appealing to<br/>\nher) and she will come up with reasons (sometimes crazy, imo, but I don&#39;t<br/>\ntell her that) why my said idea won&#39;t work. But then, when I ask her what<br/>\nshe thinks, she just says &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;<br/>\n====================<br/>\n<br/>\nBaths are easy, go swimming more often. At 8 it isn&#39;t that big a deal. Simon, my 10 year old son, doesn&#39;t bathe that often. But we go swimming at least once a week and we have a hot tub. He doesn&#39;t stink, nor does he complain of any discomfort based on personal hygiene issues. About problem solving, often making sure it is a problem, really, is a good thing. The Candy Land thing seems like you were the problem, not your daughter. If you&#39;d asked why, instead of dismissed her, you wouldn&#39;t have had the problem. <br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, I want to say more, but Linnaea wants the computer to play WoW with her brother.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":307938888,"authorName":"Amanda Horein","from":"&quot;Amanda Horein&quot; &lt;horein@...&gt;","profile":"michmdmama","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Communication Problems","postDate":"1206556892","msgId":33650,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIzMzJkZjUwMDgwMzI2MTE0MWcxZmQ5ZDMwYWhhOGEwYTBlNDM2Y2YxYzc5QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":33651,"prevInTime":33649,"nextInTime":33651,"topicId":33650,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My oldest and I seem to struggle with communication.
