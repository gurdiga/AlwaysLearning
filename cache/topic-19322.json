When I finally met someone I could trust (unfortunately, no one from my family of origin can be really trusted) I began to let him in.  What I learned about myself  was amazing.<br/>\n <br/>\nI learned that it was all about trust, not about being so strong I didn&#39;t need others.  I couldn&#39;t trust others, because those who had professed love for me, or who should have loved me, really didn&#39;t love me for myself.  They loved me for the person they thought I was -- the image I had projected to protect myself from their rejection.  My secrecy didn&#39;t prevent their rejection, it only delayed it.  It also cost me many good years with myself.  Keeping it all in was an exhausting venture, leaving me with no time or energy to know who I really was.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI also learned that it sounded noble to say I was doing it to spare others worry about me.  Sadly, they wouldn&#39;t have worried about me, only about how they could get me back into their box. Not because they don&#39;t love me the best they can, but because they truly believe it&#39;s necessary to be in the box to find happiness.  I&#39;ve learned I just can&#39;t be happy in that box.  You&#39;ll find that many people can be happy there, tho.  That&#39;s because long ago they accepted a limited happiness and believed it was enough -- they got dumbed down to accept less than the very most they could have. <br/>\n <br/>\nIf you can&#39;t tell your parents how you are feeling, find someone you can tell.  Someone else you can trust with your doubts and flaws.  Likely, you&#39;ll find you go thru more than one trusted friend before you finish your journey to meet yourself.  Listen to your own voice, follow your own lead and you&#39;ll meet other people like yourself.  Trust a few people with your feelings.  They may surprise you -- some will be helpful, some won&#39;t.  Don&#39;t take it personally.  People who aren&#39;t helpful aren&#39;t important to your journey; just move on.  It&#39;s okay to outgrow someone and to feel like you need new ideas and new support.  It&#39;s not disloyal to disagree with your parents, even when they believe they have your best interests at heart.   <br/>\n <br/>\nMaybe it is time to quit school and just explore your thoughts and feelings.  Or maybe it&#39;s just time to figure out which goals are yours and which ones have been imposed on you by parents.  A lot of that pressure you mentioned probably comes from trying to meet goals that aren&#39;t your own, and really aren&#39;t part of your life path.  Often, parents look at their child and wistfully hope their child will do all the things they wish they&#39;d done -- or even worse, all the things someone else told them they should have wished to do.  <br/>\n <br/>\nTry to figure out where you want to be, what you want to do, who you want to become.  Then give yourself permission to leave behind all the stuff that doesn&#39;t fit into that ideal.  It&#39;s okay to want different things for yourself than your parents want for you.  It&#39;s your life, not theirs. <br/>\n <br/>\nNot a complete answer, but it&#39;s a hectic morning around here.  Your post really cried out to me and I wanted to say something -- I hope it helps!<br/>\n <br/>\nSylvia <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

To me being a parent <br/>\nis kinda scary!  It&#39;s so much responsibility!  Reminds me of an <br/>\nincident a few weeks back.  My husband had the flu and there was a <br/>\nleak in the roof on our unoccupied rental house.  I had to get up on <br/>\nthat roof and fix it!  The slope of the roof wasn&#39;t too bad, but <br/>\nrunning a circular saw while standing on a roof was difficult.  At <br/>\none point the next door neighbor came out and asked, &quot;Aren&#39;t you <br/>\nscared you&#39;ll fall?&quot;  I told him of course I was scared!  I&#39;m not <br/>\nstupid!  What I was doing was difficult and dangerous.  <br/>\nHomeschooling and parenting in general is the same way--it&#39;s <br/>\ndifficult.  I guess I can&#39;t say that parenting is dangerous, but I <br/>\ndo look for reassurance that I&#39;m doing okay for my kids.
