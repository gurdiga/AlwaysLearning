I was a so-called","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-146672124\">I have a couple of things I want to say about the label, &quot;gifted,&quot; and then<br/>\nsomething about Aspergers and the idea of labeling in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was a so-called gifted student, myself, growing up in the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s,<br/>\npulled out for special classes and activities, and then I was very involved<br/>\nin gifted education in the 80&#39;s and early 90&#39;s with my own children. I<br/>\nattended conferences, was a member of the California Association for the<br/>\nGifted, parent rep on our district&#39;s council for the gifted, and so on. I<br/>\nlobbied Sacramento for more resources for the gifted. My older daughters<br/>\nwere in school for a while and both were in gifted programs. I know a whole<br/>\nlot about the reasons for having gifted programs in school and how it has<br/>\ndeveloped and been carried out over the past decades.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe official definition of &quot;gifted&quot; in the federal Elementary and Secondary<br/>\nSchool Act is:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Students, children, or youth who give evidence of high achievement<br/>\ncapability in areas such as intellectual, creative, artistic, or leadership<br/>\ncapacity, or in specific academic fields, and who need services and<br/>\nactivities not ordinarily provided by the school in order to fully develop<br/>\nthose capabilities.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, the very definition of &quot;gifted&quot; is that regular school is<br/>\nnot enough to support a child in developing to his/her full (exceptionally<br/>\nhigh) individual potential. Outside of school, this definition really has<br/>\nlittle practical meaning since every homeschooled child can supported to<br/>\nwork up to his/her own individual potential. As stated by the National<br/>\nAssociation for Gifted Children:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;*Educating each person at a certain age in the same way is like giving<br/>\neveryone the same size shoe: While a size 7 shoe may be wearable for a<br/>\nshort time by people who need a size 6 or 8, at some point the shoe just<br/>\ndoesn�t fit. Similarly, at some point, a standard education just doesn�t<br/>\nfit certain children. In those cases, a label is often required so that<br/>\nthese students can receive an appropriate education.*&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLip-service is paid to the idea that &quot;giftedness&quot; may be in areas other<br/>\nthan just intellectual (creative, artistic, leadership, or specific<br/>\nacademic fields). But, in my extensive experience, there is very very<br/>\nseldom any identification method that goes beyond some sort of<br/>\ntesting/teacher recommendation based on intellect alone. Typically, schools<br/>\ntest about 10 percent of their students (based on teacher recommendations)<br/>\nand from 2 to 8 percent (the actual percentage varies depending on the<br/>\navailable budget) are &quot;identified&quot; as gifted.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor children who are especially poor fits in school, a &quot;gifted&quot; program of<br/>\nsome sort might make a huge difference in their experience. In the cases of<br/>\nboth of my older daughters, however, the gifted programs were actually MORE<br/>\nboring and made them much more miserable than their regular classroom<br/>\nexperience.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we pulled them out. And, we quickly realized that the &quot;gifted&quot; label was<br/>\nnot only unhelpful, but potentially harmful, once we were no longer using<br/>\nit to fight for a greater share of school resources.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs homeschoolers/unschoolers, it no longer made any sense at all to compare<br/>\none child to another. And that is ALL that the label is - a comparison.<br/>\nAgain, from the National Association for the Gifted:<br/>\n<br/>\n*&quot;When we say that someone is gifted it compares their capacity to learn<br/>\nand apply what they learn to that of their same-aged-peers.&quot;*<br/>\n<br/>\nAs unschoolers, our children are not constrained to learn from a curriculum<br/>\nthat has been prepared to supposedly meet the needs of a typical child. So<br/>\nthis idea of children having differing &quot;capacities&quot; is irrelevant.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lists of characteristics of &quot;gifted&quot; children are lists of all kinds of<br/>\ncharacteristics that humans may exhibit. Intense, inquisitive, emotional,<br/>\nsensitive, empathetic, eclectic, focused..... Most parents reading those<br/>\nlists will manage to find their own child described in some of the items in<br/>\nthe same ways people find themselves in the descriptions of their<br/>\nastrological signs. Those with particularly intense kids will be especially<br/>\nconvinced.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it can be comforting for those with what my grandmother (a teacher)<br/>\nwould have called &quot;high-strung&quot; kids, to read the descriptions and think of<br/>\nthem as the characteristics of being gifted. There is pride and a<br/>\n&quot;not-my-fault&quot; relief.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there are risks - real ones - of labeling a child as gifted. The label<br/>\ncan often be used as an excuse for poor behavior. Parents can have a &quot;well,<br/>\nshe&#39;s gifted, what can we do,&quot; attitude. Very often, it means parents don&#39;t<br/>\nlook at the specifics of a problem, they just chalk it up to a child&#39;s<br/>\ngiftedness. That label can be a veil through which the parent sees the<br/>\nchild rather than seeing the child more directly and clearly. A parent<br/>\nthinks, &quot;Oh look, intense emotional reaction - a symptom of her<br/>\ngiftedness,&quot; rather than really looking at why the child is having that<br/>\nreaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe label reduces the child...it discounts the real complex and totally<br/>\nindividual person he/she is.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, it can mislead - it says, &quot;Your child is gifted and gifted children<br/>\nneed......&quot; and you might be just sure that, being gifted, that must be<br/>\nexactly what your child needs. But you could be wrong. Your child is so<br/>\nmuch more than that list of characteristics - so much more an individual.<br/>\nAgain, the label can be a veil that comes between a parent and their fully<br/>\nreal individual child.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is so much difference between gifted children that lumping them<br/>\ntogether does each a disservice.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich brings me to a quote from a very interesting article about Aspergers<br/>\nSyndrome: *&quot;If you&#39;ve seen one Aspie, you&#39;ve seen one Aspie.&quot;  *<br/>\n<br/>\nThe article is called: &quot;Aspergers theory does about-face,&quot; and says: &quot;People<br/>\nwith Asperger&#39;s syndrome, a high functioning form of autism, are often<br/>\nstereotyped as distant loners or robotic geeks. But what if what looks like<br/>\ncoldness to the outside world is a response to being overwhelmed by emotion<br/>\n� an excess of empathy, not a lack of it?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, the characteristic most indelibly associated with the<br/>\nlabel, Apsergers, (lack of empathy) might be flat-out wrong. Wrong. And the<br/>\nassumption may have led to all KINDS of inappropriate treatments of<br/>\nchildren by teachers and parents who believed/assumed their child lacked<br/>\nempathy because that&#39;s what the experts said.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe article is here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.healthzone.ca/health/article/633688.\">http://www.healthzone.ca/health/article/633688.</a><br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers can afford to ignore the labels and look directly at their own<br/>\nindividual real child. We can think for ourselves about what our child<br/>\nneeds from us. Letting go of labels is a really important part of the<br/>\nprocess of learning to think for ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe those who still see value in the labels could try an experiment - try<br/>\nto think, talk, respond, and interact with your child for a month without<br/>\nusing the label. Don&#39;t let it enter your head at all. If it does, your<br/>\nmonth starts over! &lt;G&gt;  I think you might be surprised at how difficult it<br/>\nis (if you&#39;ve been invested in the label for a while). Every time you think<br/>\n&quot;gifted,&quot; stop and substitute a more specific term that describes your own<br/>\nparticular child. I think you&#39;ll find it a valuable exercise that will help<br/>\nyou understand your own child even better than you do and it will probably<br/>\nbring you closer. I bet your child will notice it - even though he/she may<br/>\nnot know what is different.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64550,"nextTopicId":64671}}
