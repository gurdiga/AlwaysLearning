It was for a  <br/>\nhandwriting profiling company.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-First, all writers are asked to provide a full-page handwriting  <br/>\nsample on the Handwriting Sample Form  with the writer&#39;s signature  <br/>\nand date at the bottom using an ink pen (no felt tip pens, markers or  <br/>\npencils) in the custom they are most comfortable with (print or  <br/>\ncursive).  If the writer generally prints, have them include at least  <br/>\none paragraph of cursive writing.    All reports are confidential.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n====================================<br/>\n<br/>\nI question their definition of &quot;ink pen.&quot;<br/>\nI&#39;m guessing they mean ballpoint pen.   But ballpoints don&#39;t really  <br/>\nhave good ink, in a history-of-ink kind of way.  If someone said &quot;ink  <br/>\npen&quot; to me out of that context, I would guess they meant a dip pen,  <br/>\nlike a Speedball, to dip in ink—or a fountain pen, with real liquid  <br/>\nink out of a bottle.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe stuff that&#39;s in a ballpoint pen, if you squirt it out in a  <br/>\npuddle, is just a colored grease spot.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo as to handwriting analysis, if someone usually (as I do) uses a  <br/>\nfelt tip pen, the writing with a ballpoint won&#39;t be their &quot;real  <br/>\nwriting.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJust interesting to me that some professional handwriting analysis  <br/>\noutfit considers there&#39;s a right kind of pen, and that a paragraph of  <br/>\ncursive from a writer who generally prints, would tell them something  <br/>\nworth charging money about.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t remember if this has been mentioned on this list (and no  <br/>\ndoubt when the question is asked again in a year or two it might come  <br/>\nback around), but &quot;signature&quot; has to do with the sign of the cross,  <br/>\nwith swearing in the name of the father and the son and the holy  <br/>\nspirit to an agreement.  the X was at one time a more vertical X—a  <br/>\ncross.  But sometimes the document had a red cross already painted on  <br/>\nand the &quot;signer&quot; swore to the agreement while his finger was on the  <br/>\nalready-written cross.<br/>\n<br/>\nFound something, but this and everything else I&#39;ve read in the past  <br/>\nhalf hour or so supports printed signatures being fine:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Legal definitions and validity of &quot;Signature&quot;<br/>\nThere is no general statutory definition of &quot;signature&quot; in Australian  <br/>\nand New Zealand statute law. Through many court cases over hundreds  <br/>\nof years, judges have defined &quot;signature&quot; as containing these elements:<br/>\n<br/>\n.        Writing, drawing or affixing;[11]<br/>\n<br/>\n.        With your own hand;[12]<br/>\n<br/>\n.

With the intention of authenticating a document as being  <br/>\nwritten by you, or legally binding on you.[14]<br/>\n<br/>\nRubber stamps with the name of a company or person are also legally  <br/>\nvalid to serve as a signature.[15] A person may also authorise  <br/>\nanother to sign documents on his or her behalf.[16] Long before the  <br/>\nadvent of electronic signatures, the law recognised the legal  <br/>\nvalidity of facsimile signatures - an early victory for electronic  <br/>\ncommerce!

I mean isn&#39;t that what a signature is?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nA signature is supposed to be unique to the signer.   Lots of folks do not<br/>\nuse cursive or even the full name. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow if he goes into the military he will have to sign lots of forms and<br/>\npapers using his full &quot;legal&quot;  name with the same spelling as on the birth<br/>\ncertificate or social security card.......a bit of a pain for those who<br/>\nspent their whole life being known by their &quot;middle&quot;  name.   One of our<br/>\nfamily stories is a cousin whose first name was &quot;Buddy&quot;.   When getting a<br/>\nsecurity clearance he had to go back and re-sign everything because it<br/>\nturned out that his birth certificate had spelled it &quot;Buddye&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBut back to  Seth.   Encourage him to develop his own unique signature which<br/>\ncould be in cursive, in manuscript,  in a combo of the two, or a series of<br/>\nsymbols.  The idea is that it should be reproducible (by him),  and<br/>\neventually......NOT  so easily reproducible by a forger!   THAT is the whole<br/>\npoint of having the &quot;printed&quot;  name below a signature on legal documents.<br/>\nA signature does not need to be &quot;legible&quot;  and certainly does not need to be<br/>\nin schoolboy cursive. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nvicki <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Cursive/Signatures","postDate":"1149889222","msgId":26079,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY5RDgyOUNDLTg1NjItNEM2Mi1CNkNFLUVEMzBGMjlFNTA4MkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwODYwMWM2OGMwYyQyOTcwNzU5MCQ2NDAxYThjMEB0aWJlcml1bT4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwODYwMWM2OGMwYyQyOTcwNzU5MCQ2NDAxYThjMEB0aWJlcml1bT4="},"prevInTopic":26076,"nextInTopic":26080,"prevInTime":26078,"nextInTime":26080,"topicId":26076,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I don t know or care to know how to write in cursive but I CAN sign my name.
