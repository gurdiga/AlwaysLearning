as something negative. It&#39;s NOT. We&#39;re <br/>\nALL  judgemental---every day. We&#39;ve all here &quot;judged&quot; the school sysem to be <br/>\nlacking---and harmful, so we won&#39;t send our children there. We&#39;ve all <br/>\n&quot;judged&quot; unschooling to be an exceptional way to rear our children. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a &quot;judge&quot; my job is to look at things objectively and form an educated <br/>\nopinion based on facts and hands-on experience. It&#39;s a GOOD thing!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all gain knowledge with age (well, MOST of us ;-) . Pam&#39;s daughter knows <br/>\nmore about dogs than most of us, and Ren knows more about living in <br/>\nsnow---and though I could probably give Pam&#39;s daughter a pointer or two on <br/>\ndogs (bad pun), I would have to defer to Ren on all snow subjects. I could <br/>\ncertainly have questions for both, but I might have to object with Pam&#39;s <br/>\ndaughter based on more experience. Many here would be put to shame by Pam&#39;s <br/>\ndaughter with reference to dogs, but would challenge things Ren has to say <br/>\nabout driving in snow (because they live in St Paul or Toronto or whereever).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe really cool thing about the younger posters and lurkers is that they&#39;ve <br/>\nalready got a clue! And not just a clue---they have a handle on it. And they <br/>\ncertainly have it over 98% of the country. Some of us would give our right <br/>\nhands to have known this stuff earlier before we exposed our children to <br/>\nschool!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat older posters are questioning is why a newbie---no matter how <br/>\n&quot;unschooling-aware&quot; she is---would be posting that tv is <br/>\n&quot;bad/wrong/ugly/inappropriate&quot; for a 3 yr old. Making &quot;judgements&quot; based on <br/>\nyears of watching our kids view and not view tv is using facts and hands-on <br/>\nexperience. Yes, the experts have watched children and tv too---school <br/>\nchildren who must also do homework and get to bed early and read 100 pages a <br/>\nnight. School children who are also taught to do what any authority figure <br/>\nsays (this could make them pretty good targets for commercials, too). <br/>\n<br/>\nChildren whose tv isn&#39;t regulated (or denied) won&#39;t watch EVERYTHING---they <br/>\nbecome more discriminating-------------judges!

They make them<br/>\nmemorize the abc song, drill them on how to tie a<br/>\nshoe, &#39;teach&#39; them to write, only play games with the<br/>\nhidden agenda of teaching something, buy and force<br/>\ncurriculum on them....and on and on.  Would you<br/>\nconsider that &#39;unschooling&#39; (I mean the philosophy of<br/>\nchild-led, natural learning)?  I don&#39;t.  That is why I<br/>\nconsider it a lifestyle.  With exception to hsers,<br/>\nevery child I know above the age of 3 is in preschool.<br/>\n  Many hsers feel the need to teach their children at<br/>\nyoung ages also.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;&lt;Sure.

I agree completely that I<br/>\nwill do all of those things, but the point is that it<br/>\nhas to do with who I am, not my age, and that even as<br/>\na young, newer parent I may have something useful to<br/>\noffer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; And our experiences when we were under thirty, no<br/>\n&gt; matter how similar or <br/>\n&gt; different, were the experiences of twenty-year-olds.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But, again, it can be very different experiences.  I<br/>\nknow many twenty somethings who do not have children,<br/>\nwho think the purpose of life is to go to a bar and<br/>\nhave every new thing that money can buy.  Is there<br/>\nexperience the same as mine, a 24 year old mother of<br/>\ntwo, with a husband, and a desire to grow and learn?<br/>\nNot even close.  Their judgment of the twenties will<br/>\nbe very different from mine.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;&lt;Maybe that is why I feel different.

I assume EVERYONE does.  And if they do, why<br/>\ndiscard something based on a persons age or<br/>\nexperience?  That was my thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve met many of the women on this list in person. <br/>\n&gt; They know a HECK of a <br/>\n&gt; lot, in depth, not just about their own children,<br/>\n&gt; but other unschooling <br/>\n&gt; families they&#39;ve been in contact with for years. <br/>\n&gt; This is long range <br/>\n&gt; information with depth, not snapshot-of-the-moment<br/>\n&gt; statistics .<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good.

One can have<br/>\nyouth, idealism, and experience.  The experience may<br/>\nnot be as a parent, but as the child, or aunt, etc. <br/>\nIt is not the same experience, but valuable experience<br/>\nnone the less.

I find lots on this list valuable.  But it is<br/>\nnot always going to be valuable to those people<br/>\nbecause they may have a different ideal of what<br/>\nunschooling is and they experience things differently.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Because you know what?  Until the day your child is<br/>\n&gt; of an age to be required <br/>\n&gt; to attend school and the bus passes by and he stays<br/>\n&gt; home, you&#39;re not <br/>\n&gt; unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I disagree because of how I see unschooling.  I see it<br/>\nas a way of life that can start from birth.  It does<br/>\nnot really have to do with school, but with how we<br/>\nlive.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;&lt;Age....I have a huge problem with people<br/>\n&gt; classifying<br/>\n&gt; others intelligence, wisdom, or understanding by<br/>\n&gt; their<br/>\n&gt; age. ...

I do not think<br/>\n&gt; so. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can you seal this in an envelope, date it for ten<br/>\n&gt; years from now, and report <br/>\n&gt; back to us please?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sure.  I am not claiming that I won&#39;t change, grow,<br/>\ngain wisdom, etc.  But that it has little to nothing<br/>\nto do with age and has to do with who I am, my<br/>\npersonality, and my goals.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;&lt; I think that is<br/>\n&gt; such a unrealistic pre-judgement of people. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; PRE judgement?  How about the experience of people<br/>\n&gt; who used to be under 30 <br/>\n&gt; and knew hundreds of people who were too, who grew<br/>\n&gt; through that, who have <br/>\n&gt; known hundreds or thousands of people grow from<br/>\n&gt; teens, through twenties,  to <br/>\n&gt; thirties and they&#39;ve seen a pattern?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But a pattern does not define EVERY person of those<br/>\nages.  There are always people who do not fit in the<br/>\npatterns.  And your experience of being under thirty<br/>\ncould be VERY different from mine.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; WE have been under and over thirty.<br/>\n&gt; Those who have not can&#39;t tell us we&#39;re unrealistic<br/>\n&gt; and &quot;pre-judging.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you are judging me strictly by my age, then I<br/>\nwould, and feel right in saying so, that you were<br/>\npre-judging me, regardless of your experience.  Your<br/>\nexperience is not mine, your personality is not mine,<br/>\nso you really could not judge me rightly just from<br/>\nknowing my age.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is it pre-judgment if I don&#39;t expect a ten month old<br/>\n&gt; baby to walk?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would say any expectation is a pre-judgment.  My son<br/>\nwalked at 10 months, I did not expect it, I judged<br/>\nwrongly that he would not walk until around 12 months.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Does it prove anything about babies as a class of<br/>\n&gt; people if one walks at nine <br/>\n&gt; months?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It proves that the standard, the usual, is not always.<br/>\n That expectations based on experience are not always<br/>\ncorrect in judging another.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  And my <br/>\n&gt; request that people read a while first was<br/>\n&gt; reasonable.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree.<br/>\nI think it would be a reasonable request to anyone<br/>\nfirst joining a list, whether experienced or not<br/>\nbecause the dynamics of the list may not fit them and<br/>\ntheir definitions for unschooling, or whatever the<br/>\nlist is for, may not be the same.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;&lt;I<br/>\n&gt; actually assumed that experienced unschoolers would<br/>\n&gt; not judge others by age, experience, or other<br/>\n&gt; arbitrary means....I assumed they would have a<br/>\n&gt; better<br/>\n&gt; grasp of the diverse ways in which people grow and<br/>\n&gt; learn and come to wisdom.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Insults won&#39;t make us think more of your wisdom and<br/>\n&gt; judgment.  If you thought <br/>\n&gt; they would, you need to get more experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It was not intended as an insult.  I was pointing out<br/>\nan assumption of mine that classified people as the<br/>\nsame just because of a title they choose to wear.  I<br/>\nwas pointing out my fault of assuming before I knew<br/>\npeople.  Not everyone will have the same understanding<br/>\nof how one learns and grows, that is what I meant. <br/>\nThe word &#39;better&#39; should have been replaced by<br/>\nsomething like &quot;a grasp of it similar to mine, since<br/>\nwe are classifying ourselves similarly&quot;.  Sorry if it<br/>\ninsulted anyone, that was not my intent.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;While I think it is a good suggestion that people<br/>\n&gt; read<br/>\n&gt; and listen more on here, I think it is a good<br/>\n&gt; suggestion for everyone, not just new unschoolers or<br/>\n&gt; people with young children.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Experienced unschoolers would not have made the<br/>\n&gt; arguments being made on <br/>\n&gt; Monday.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Mostly not, but that would depend somewhat on how they<br/>\ndefined unschooling.<br/>\nAnd some inexperienced ones would not have made the<br/>\narguments either.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;&lt;Perhaps we could all learn more from one another<br/>\n&gt; if<br/>\n&gt; our pre-judgements were put aside. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It happens all the time.  And invariably, after a<br/>\n&gt; few years, unschoolers say <br/>\n&gt; &quot;I thought I knew so much when I started, but now<br/>\n&gt; that I&#39;ve really lived it <br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s so natural.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe that is why I feel different. It feels natural<br/>\nto me now, and has for a long time, but yet I don&#39;t<br/>\nfeel like I know so much.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I WAS discounting things that were being said on<br/>\n&gt; Monday, not because the <br/>\n&gt; people were new, but because what they were saying<br/>\n&gt; was not going to work in <br/>\n&gt; the context of unschooling, and they weren&#39;t backing<br/>\n&gt; off from saying it, <br/>\n&gt; insultingly, in the presence of my well-behaved<br/>\n&gt; guests who were already at <br/>\n&gt; the party.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Okay.  That is not how I understood it because age and<br/>\nexperience were brought into it, and for me that<br/>\nconfused the original point.<br/>\n<br/>\nKitrina <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGreat stuff seeking new owners in Yahoo!

Experience does not necessarily mean knowledge,<br/>\nunderstanding, or &quot;good&quot; advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been called, more than once, young and<br/>\nidealistic.  It was meant as an insult, but I took it<br/>\nas a compliment.  Idealism can cause wonderful things<br/>\nto happen.  Idealism can be just as valuable as<br/>\nexperience, it is what gets people on this path in the<br/>\nfirst place.  Those of us who are &#39;new&#39; to unschooling<br/>\nare idealistic.  We see this theory, this way of life,<br/>\nthat for some reason fits us and our beliefs.  One can<br/>\nfully understand the ideas without the experience from<br/>\nthe parent perspective.  I may not have the experience<br/>\nof unschooling for x amount of years, but I have an<br/>\nunderstanding of it from my experiences with learning.<br/>\n I can watch children and see how they learn without<br/>\ndirectly &#39;raising&#39; them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAge....I have a huge problem with people classifying<br/>\nothers intelligence, wisdom, or understanding by their<br/>\nage.  I know some people who are pretty old, 90, that<br/>\ndo not know half of what I do.  Yes, she has the<br/>\nexperience of living every age up to that one, but the<br/>\nWAY she lived it does not provide her with knowledge<br/>\nor wisdom.   Does age really matter?  I do not think<br/>\nso.  I have heard on here, as well as from some<br/>\nrelatives, that people change at 30.  I think that is<br/>\nsuch a unrealistic pre-judgement of people.  Some<br/>\npeople never grow up, some do at young ages.  Some<br/>\nchildren have more wisdom to offer than some 80 year<br/>\nolds.  <br/>\n<br/>\nUntil one really knows another person, it is IMO,<br/>\nsomewhat foolish to discount their opinions simply<br/>\nbecause they are young and inexperienced.  It would<br/>\nalso be foolish to assume just because some one is<br/>\nolder and has children that are grown, that they know<br/>\neverything about parenting or nothing about it.  I<br/>\nactually assumed that experienced unschoolers would<br/>\nnot judge others by age, experience, or other<br/>\narbitrary means....I assumed they would have a better<br/>\ngrasp of the diverse ways in which people grow and<br/>\nlearn and come to wisdom. I was foolish to assume<br/>\nthat.  <br/>\nWhile I think it is a good suggestion that people read<br/>\nand listen more on here, I think it is a good<br/>\nsuggestion for everyone, not just new unschoolers or<br/>\npeople with young children.<br/>\nPerhaps we could all learn more from one another if<br/>\nour pre-judgements were put aside.  The new<br/>\nunschoolers may say something that an experienced one<br/>\ncan learn from, but if you discount it because they<br/>\nare new you may miss out.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace.<br/>\n<br/>\nNamaste,<br/>\nKitrina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGreat stuff seeking new owners in Yahoo!
