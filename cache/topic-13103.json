So when I look at those pictures I think the same thing.   When you see me in August my hair will probably be long again.   I tend to go short, long, short, long.   I like what&#39;s maintenance free, so,  the short hair usually tends to be short lived!               <br/>\n <br/>\nIts fun seeing what people look like when you&#39;ve read their thoughts or writings,  isn&#39;t it?<br/>\n <br/>\nI called Shyrley before I went to Mexico.  I felt bad because I was going to go out and see her, but then at the last minute our family went on this Mexico trip instead.  And she got ditched for warm weather,  sorry Shyrley, again.              <br/>\nAnyway,  when she was talking,  I sat there listening to her voice.   She has the sweetest voice,   I didn&#39;t tell you that Shyrley.     I hate my voice when I hear it in recordings.  Maybe its just odd to hear one&#39;s own voice?
