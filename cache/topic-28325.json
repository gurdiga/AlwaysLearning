(I won&#39; t copy it here since Yahoo made<br/>\nsure everyone got it a dozen times or so yesterday.)  It is very inspiring<br/>\nto see how differently you&#39;ve gone about your troop.  I think if we are<br/>\ngoing to keep our troop we will explore a more relaxed model like yours with<br/>\nlots of play and focusing on respect and the individual needs of the girls.<br/>\nNow that I write it here it seems obvious but just two weeks ago I had no<br/>\nidea what to do to change things.  I am inspired also by your free play park<br/>\ndays.  Anika would *love* that and I bet the other girls would too.  And<br/>\nthank you, also for sharing about Roots and Shoots.  I was really glad to<br/>\ntake a look at that.<br/>\n <br/>\nYou asked &quot;what do you do&quot; when Anika acts out.  I guess most of the time I<br/>\ndon&#39;t let her get that far.  I stand next to her, hold her hand, focus on<br/>\nher for a bit.  But this still just keeps the explosion at bay.  Her<br/>\ndiscontent is still bubbling beneath the surface. There *are* times she is<br/>\nengaged and likes being there.   I haven&#39;t tried to utilized the group as<br/>\nyou suggest.  That is a very good idea.  Last week when she did get to the<br/>\npoint of no return I left my co leader to do an activity with the group and<br/>\ntook Ani outside to let her calm down.  She very much wanted to go back<br/>\ninside and didn&#39;t want to miss time with her friends so she was still<br/>\nanxious, not quite calm, when we returned but that was the very end of the<br/>\ntime and she was able to do a closer with us before everyone left.  After<br/>\nthey all went she sat on my lap for a long time (we meet at a school so I<br/>\nstill had to gather my stuff and go)  She talked about all the things that<br/>\nhappened that bothered her and cried because the kids hadn&#39;t wanted  her to<br/>\nplay with them at the end.  (This happened after the meeting when they were<br/>\nall getting ready to leave)  I told her that some of the girls were upset<br/>\nbecause she had been talking loudly or rudely to them.  She said &quot;but I<br/>\nstopped.  They still wouldn&#39;t let me play.&quot;  So I see she is thinking about<br/>\nit.  She was disappointed that her decision to try to get along wasn&#39;t met<br/>\nwith immediate reversal.  I actually think the girls would have let her play<br/>\nwith them if I had pointed out that she heard their complaint and wanted to<br/>\ntry again to be nice.   If this had happened earlier in the meeting we<br/>\ncould&#39;ve talked about it and helped them all but it happened as everyone was<br/>\ngathering their things and leaving and the moms were trying to get everyone<br/>\nout.  <br/>\n <br/>\nTomorrow is the next meeting and I have asked someone else to lead so I can<br/>\nhang back with my daughter.  I shared your post with my co leader and we&#39;re<br/>\ngoing to try to put lots more play time into our gatherings.  In the end I<br/>\nstill might drop the group but I want to try first to see if it can be<br/>\nsomething much better than it is right now.  Anika, despite her many<br/>\nfrustrations still wants to give it a go.  <br/>\n <br/>\nKrisula<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Help with dd and Daisy scouts","postDate":"1175138088","msgId":28352,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkzOTc1OTI2LTlDMzEtNDZDMi05QjQwLTk1MzQ0NDE0QTk1RkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGV1ZjRubSs0OTdpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGV1ZjRubSs0OTdpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":28351,"nextInTopic":28353,"prevInTime":28351,"nextInTime":28353,"topicId":28325,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-So, if one child is really uncomfortable, the other girls can use their creative problem solving skills to help their friend in need.

I have been a daisy leader and a <br/>\nbrownie leader both at the same time even, with a mixed age group.  <br/>\nWhenever we&#39;ve had problems in our group with any of the kids, mine <br/>\nor my co-leader&#39;s or anyone else, we do stop and regroup and work it <br/>\nout.  We go back to the GS laws and work on those things that <br/>\nsurface.  No girl is going to be happy 100% of the time in every <br/>\nmeeting.  The key with our troop is to work together as a team and <br/>\nhelp each girl feel comfortable and accepted and as happy as <br/>\npossible.  So, if one child is really uncomfortable, the other girls <br/>\ncan use their creative problem solving skills to help their friend in <br/>\nneed.  &quot;Be a sister to every girl scout&quot;  Those laws are set in place <br/>\nfor a reason.  Use them when you need to, talk about it.  Scouts is <br/>\nnot about doing crafts and projects as much as it is about personal <br/>\ngrowth and teamwork, especially at the daisy/early brownie age.  The <br/>\nparents should know that too, if they are expecting something <br/>\ndifferent.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also build in free play for our meetings.  Daisy girls really <br/>\ncan&#39;t handle more than 30 min of sit down focus type work, some can&#39;t <br/>\neven handle that, and there should be built in options for those that <br/>\ncan&#39;t.  We have play time EVERY week when we meet, sometimes it&#39;s <br/>\nstuff like freeze dance or other active GS games (and there are lots <br/>\nof them in the GS handbooks) and sometimes we have the girls bring <br/>\ndress up clothes or sometimes we bring cardboard boxes or things to <br/>\nbuild forts and do pretend play.  Sometimes we set actual meeting <br/>\ntime to do nothing but play at a park, for a break from doing <br/>\nstructured GS work, we all meet somewhere with a picnic lunch and let <br/>\nthe kids play.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe let the girls have loud times and quiet times.  I don&#39;t know what <br/>\nyour parents are expecting, but you are a volunteer guiding the kids <br/>\nthrough a scouting experience.  When girls signed up for our troop, <br/>\nwe made it absolutely clear that we were not structured and that our <br/>\nfocus was on fun, play, and getting along, with a bonus of doing some <br/>\nGS stuff.  Within our GS stuff, we also work on Roots and Shoots, so <br/>\ngoing to parks and stuff is totally part of the deal.  We also <br/>\ninvolve the parents as much as possible, we delegate stuff for them <br/>\nto bring or do for meetings.  We make is as mandatory as possible for <br/>\nthe parents to be there and present with the child.  I know other <br/>\ntroops aren&#39;t like that, but we made ours like that, because we <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to be a drop off babysitting service like some troops are.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if anything I&#39;m saying will help your troop or not.  I <br/>\ndo know that we&#39;ve had people leave our troop because it wasn&#39;t <br/>\nstructured enough, and good riddance as far as I&#39;m concerned.  All <br/>\nyou need is 4 girls to have a troop.  I&#39;d rather have 4 really nice <br/>\ngirls that all get along than a large troop that clashes or causes my <br/>\nchild to feel insecure.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Help with dd and Daisy scouts","postDate":"1174843563","msgId":28327,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGV1NmJiYitkN2hnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDcwMzI1MTYyNC5sMlBHT2RWdDAyMTkzOEBtcy1zbXRwLTAzLnNvY2FsLnJyLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":28326,"nextInTopic":28342,"prevInTime":28326,"nextInTime":28328,"topicId":28325,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... mostly very ... impliment ... consequence of not ... because no ...

It seems unfair to your dd that you are <br/>\nfocussing so much energy on these other kids when she is - quite <br/>\nliterally - screaming for your attention. If you were free to <br/>\nfacilitate her needs you could take her outside or help her play in <br/>\nother ways that allow her to be with the group but not necessarily <br/>\ndoing the same things as everyone else. <br/>\n<br/>\nBoth my dd and my stepson have always needed a bit of help dealing <br/>\nwith group activities and events. When my stepson was small (we, <br/>\nsadly, didn&#39;t know about unschooling, then) we would get very <br/>\nfrustrated when other people weren&#39;t tolerant of his boisterousness -<br/>\n I understand that feeling! It took us far too long to figure out <br/>\nthat a whole lot of his disruptive behavior was due to the fact that <br/>\nwe were shoving his needs aside. Once we started to prioritize his <br/>\nneeds we found social situations went a lot more smoothly for <br/>\neveryone. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Some of the other girls&#39; mothers have told me that<br/>\n&gt; this frightens their daughters.  and although I could see this <br/>\n </span></blockquote>when they had<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; just met, My take is that they are annoyed with her and frustrated <br/>\n </span></blockquote>rather<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; than frightened. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t be so quick to discount the idea that the other kids are <br/>\nfrightened, especially if your dd is very loud. Loud noises can be <br/>\nscary. Loud people-noises may be associated with angry adults for <br/>\nsome of these girls, too - that&#39;s a pretty scary association. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut even if they are &quot;just&quot; annoyed and frustrated, as the troop <br/>\nleader you have a responsibility to create a peaceful environment <br/>\nfor these girls. Its unkind to allow one girl in the group to be so <br/>\ndistraught as to &quot;bring the meetings to a screaming halt.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTalk to the other moms and see if one or more would be interested in <br/>\nfacilitating the group activities so that you can help your dd.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 5, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":177721839,"authorName":"Angela Shaw","from":"&quot;Angela Shaw&quot; &lt;game-enthusiast@...&gt;","profile":"autonomousangela","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Help with dd and Daisy scouts","postDate":"1174842767","msgId":28326,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDYwMWM3NmYwMCRjZjhlNmY5MCQ2NjAwYThjMEBFYm9ueT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDcwMzI1MTYyNC5sMlBHT2RWdDAyMTkzOEBtcy1zbXRwLTAzLnNvY2FsLnJyLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":28325,"nextInTopic":28327,"prevInTime":28325,"nextInTime":28327,"topicId":28325,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If it is your troop, can you not allow for more free play?
