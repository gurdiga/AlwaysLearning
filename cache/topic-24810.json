Teaching doesn&#39;t make someone learn.  Learning is a totally <br/>\nindependent function from teaching.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the model of the third law of motion were true in this case, then I <br/>\nthink the reaction to teaching is definitely not learning, but <br/>\n*resistance*.  That would be the first law of motion, involving <br/>\ninertia.  Students stop trying to learn on their own because they have been <br/>\nconditioned to believe they can&#39;t.  (Man, Newton was really smart! LOL!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that resistance will definitely grow stronger with the application of <br/>\nmore teaching.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning is an individual, internal process that takes place in a person&#39;s <br/>\nbrain as information is sought and applied and connections made.  That is <br/>\nwhy no state has compulsory education laws, but rather compulsory <br/>\n*attendance*.  No one can force another to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your daughter wants to learn to knit, she will seek out <br/>\ninformation.  She will ask questions, ask you to show her.  She will watch <br/>\nand listen, and take it with her and apply it in her own fashion.  She <br/>\nmight use you as a resource, she might not.  She might just look it up on <br/>\nthe internet or in a book.  Did the internet or the book teach her to <br/>\nknit?  No, she learned it on her own.  If you try to be more than the <br/>\ninternet in the process, you will remove the responsibility of learning <br/>\nfrom her and take on the responsibility of &quot;teaching her how&quot;.  Even the <br/>\nprocess of learning something is showing her how to learn other future things.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan M (VA)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://radicalchristianunschool.homestead.com/index.html\">http://radicalchristianunschool.homestead.com/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Real, natural learning is in the living.
