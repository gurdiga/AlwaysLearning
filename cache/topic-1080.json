It is known, however, that in the<br/>\nearly Christian Church the Birth of Christ, Adoration of the Magi and<br/>\nTheophany [western Epiphany] were celebrated on the same day, January 6. The<br/>\ndate of introduction of the Nativity Feast into the Church calendar was<br/>\ndifferent in all 5 Patriarchates (Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria,<br/>\nConstantinople and Rome). The Church of Jerusalem was the last one to adopt<br/>\nthis feast in the 6th century.<br/>\n<br/>\nDecember the 25th, was the date of a pagan festival in Rome, originated in<br/>\n274 by the emperor Aurelian, as the birthday of the &quot;unconquered sun&quot;<br/>\n(natalis solis invicti). Sometime before 336, the Church of Rome established<br/>\na commemorative festival of the birth of Christ, the Son of Righteousness.<br/>\nThe first evidence of the Nativity celebration in the East, as a separate<br/>\nfeast, comes from Constantinople.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 381, Gregory the Theologian delivered his 39th sermon on the feast of<br/>\nTheophany and called it the festival of lights, commemorating the Baptism of<br/>\nChrist, the true light. He speaks of the Nativity as recently past and<br/>\nreminds his audience that in the Nativity Feast they followed the star,<br/>\nworshipped with the Magi, were bathed in light with shepherds, glorified God<br/>\nwith angels, took Christ in their arms with Simeon and confessed Him with<br/>\nAnna. He continues: &quot;Now, however, at Theophany, this is another event and<br/>\nanother mystery, the Baptism.¹<br/>\n<br/>\nOn December 20, 386, in his sermon on the martyr Philogonius, St. John<br/>\nChrysostom looks forward to the Nativity Feast as the Birthday of Christ and<br/>\nthe festival from which all the other come. He also mentions the visit of<br/>\nthe Magi as commemorated on the Nativity day. And then, five days later, in<br/>\nhis sermon delivered on the Feast of the Nativity, Chrysostom says that this<br/>\nfeast has been known to Antiochenes for less than 10 years, although it has<br/>\nbeen known longer in the West.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is also known that the separation of the Nativity and the Baptism into<br/>\ntwo different holy days occurred in Egypt (Patriarchate of Alexandria) in<br/>\nthe second half of the 5th century, shortly before the false teacher Arius<br/>\ndied.<br/>\n***<br/>\n[me again]<br/>\n<br/>\nThe early church didn&#39;t consider the whens and wheres of Christ&#39;s birth<br/>\nimportant, although the New Testament church included the Virgin Mary among<br/>\nits members; she knew when and where she gave birth, and probably passed on<br/>\nthe information.  That&#39;s why there&#39;s a church in a cave near Bethlehem.<br/>\nTradition holds that Luke, who records the event Linus recites in &quot;A Charlie<br/>\nBrown Christmas,&quot; spent time with Mary, essentially interviewing her for his<br/>\ngospel.  (Not being a disciple, he got his info. second hand.)  Caesar<br/>\nAugustus would have had anarchy on his hands if he&#39;d demanded the entire<br/>\npopulace travel to their home towns in *December*; it had to have been<br/>\nspring.  The lambs wouldn&#39;t have been born yet, and no sheep would have been<br/>\nout on the hills at night.  (I think, though, that if you&#39;re going to<br/>\nbelieve in a virgin birth, you might as well believe in angels, too.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe date for the feast WAS chosen to coincide with winter solstice, and yes,<br/>\nthere was a Roman holiday for the sun on that day.  If you&#39;ve seen<br/>\n&quot;Gladiator,&quot; which takes place around 192, you&#39;ll get a good idea of what<br/>\nRoman pagan festivals were like - it was Constantine who outlawed the<br/>\ngladiatorial contests as barbaric, inhuman rituals.   The church did choose<br/>\nthe same day, since the newly Christian populace needed something more<br/>\ncivilized to do,  and created a feast to replace it.
