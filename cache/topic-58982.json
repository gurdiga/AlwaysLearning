The world has been all a-swirl for me, online and off this week.  Many of the incidents involve language and choice of words.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d appreciate it if others on the list would keep this thread alive for a few days so it won&#39;t be swept away in the flow of language and words. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s something Lori Odhner wrote and published today on her blog Marriage Moats:<br/>\n----------------------------------------------<br/>\nDog Biscuits<br/>\n <br/>\nOnce upon a time there were two sisters, Molly and Polly, chatting about what to give their daughters for Christmas. The notion of puppies came up, and they both agreed it would be a wonderful way to foster responsibility.<br/>\n <br/>\nChristmas arrived, and the two cousins, Sarah and Tara were thrilled to find yelping little dogs under their trees.<br/>\n <br/>\nSarah began training her puppy with patience. She filled her pockets with dog treats each morning, intending to find every trace of good behavior to reward. One day she was trying to teach her spaniel, Priscilla, to wait at the door while she walked up the sidewalk, and when she whistled, to come running to her side. They began with copious hugs and slobbery licks. Then Sarah gently told Priscilla to stay as she walked away, and quickly rewarded her for any brief success. Being young, Priscilla did get distracted easily, and Sarah had to smile and clap to get her attention back. Gradually, as she wanted so much to please Sarah, and enjoyed the dog biscuits she offered, Priscilla learned the behaviors Sarah wanted. Within a few weeks they mastered more tricks, with very little attention given to her mistakes. They both enjoyed their time together, often taking a break from training to simply romp and roll.<br/>\n <br/>\nTara began training her collie with an emphasis on discipline. Lucy, she determined, was going to obey her at all times. She began with trying to teach her to stay, but she expected her to sit still for a full minute before rewarding her. Lucy would eagerly look at Tara for a few seconds, but then she would leap off to chase a bird, or sniff an invisible trail. Tara was resolute in her expectations, and refused to reward her for anything less. She scolded Lucy repeatedly, shouting and waving a stick over her head. Eventually Lucy grew tired, put her head on her paws and sat for sixty seconds, mostly to avoid the threatening branch. Tara was surprised at this semi obedience, and shouted praises over her shoulder as she ran back into the house to climb up and find the dog treats in the cupboard.<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;Good dog!&quot; she called from the kitchen. By the time she returned Lucy had trotted off to the back yard. Tara was unsure of whether to still reward her, as she was now digging in the garden, so she broke the biscuit in half and gave her a small piece. She was not sure whether to keep working on sitting, or to focus on not digging up her mother&#39;s rose bushes. She screamed at Lucy when she started chewing on the gardening gloves left on a wicker chair. Her temper started to flare up, especially since her next door neighbor was watching.<br/>\n <br/>\nTara did not enjoy owning a dog as much as she expected she would.<br/>\n <br/>\nMolly and Polly were shopping together when they talked about how the puppy adventure was going. Molly reached up for two boxes of dog treats to put in her cart.<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;Sarah goes through a box every few days. She calls her dog Precious and she really is! They are so cute together. Priscilla follows her everywhere, and looks really sad when Sarah is gone. I am so glad we got her! Need some dog biscuits too?&quot; Molly asked her sister.<br/>\n <br/>\nPolly sighed. &quot;I think we are still on the first box of treats. Tara is not having much luck. She hardly spends time with Lucy at all anymore. I guess collies are harder to train than spaniels. Lucy still chews all of our shoes, and barks at every car that drives by. Tara calls her Loser, and I guess she is. She breaks things, races through the house and scares little kids.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;Sorry to hear that!&quot; Molly sympathized.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe end.<br/>\n <br/>\nI have never trained an animal to do anything. But I have managed to modify my family&#39;s behavior on occasion. I notice that the scolding was less effective than the encouragement. There is a book called What Shamu Taught Me about Marriage, in which the author looks at the techniques trainers use to get parrots to ride motorcycles and dolphins to clear thirty foot hoops.<br/>\n <br/>\nI would tell you about it but I see my husband holding a frying pan and smiling at me in a way that makes me want to both salivate and go start supper. <br/>\n ----------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nLori is one of the best writers I&#39;ve known in my life, but she writes to help families get along better and not to make money.  She was one of my first La Leche League Leaders.  She and Carol Rice were the leaders when I went to my first meeting in the fall of 1986.  I didn&#39;t know them apart at first, but that night one of them said &quot;Be your child&#39;s partner, not his adversary.&quot;  I think it was Carol, but I always credit them both because they were a great team as leaders, and they became friends and I&#39;m still in contact with them today.  Carol&#39;s youngest daughter is over here quite often, still.  My trip to the Northeast U.S. next month is based around Lori&#39;s invitation to me to speak at a marriage conference she organizes each year on the weekend nearest Valentine&#39;s Day.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you read it fast, please read the story above again, more slowly, when you get a chance. <br/>\nIt&#39;s not really a recommendation of operant conditioning.  It&#39;s a spotlight shone on what seeing the worst and withholding love will reap.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere it is with the photo that came with it.  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://archive.aweber.com/marriagemoats/1XZAZ/h/Marriage_Moats_Dog_Biscuits.htm\">http://archive.aweber.com/marriagemoats/1XZAZ/h/Marriage_Moats_Dog_Biscuits.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLori&#39;s writings and advice helped me have the solid, peaceful family I have today.  There were other influences and helpers too, but today I&#39;m praising Lori again, and I&#39;m glad I&#39;ll get to see her in a few weeks.  Lori started off unschooling, but is a minister&#39;s wife, and twice they&#39;ve moved to work at a church with an onsite school, and so Lori&#39;s duty was there, but her knowledge of love and learning are huge.  She is sweet and gentle.  For her it has to do with her religion, but others can make those choices of action and language and word choice even if they&#39;re atheists. Schuyler Waynforth does.   Deb Lewis does and I don&#39;t know what she believes about religion.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the harshest, sharpest, meanest people I&#39;ve known used words as cutting tools, and for them it had to do with their religion.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me the most important word in the phrase &quot;Language and choice of words&quot; is &quot;choice.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Language and choice of words","postDate":"1295506082","msgId":59006,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU2MTQyLjM2OTc2LnFtQHdlYjExMDQxNi5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIyNzU0MC4xMzY3MC5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNi5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDQ5MDg1OS45NTU1Ny5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwMS5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+IDxBQU5Ma1RpbkczMHY2MEJUdS1ENHNhR1VUZU1VTVc4PVdYRnN4RzZhaTcrNzNAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+IDwyMjc1NDAuMTM2NzAucW1Ad2ViODE1MDYubWFpbC5tdWQueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58999,"nextInTopic":59037,"prevInTime":59005,"nextInTime":59007,"topicId":58982,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***I was wondering if people who talk meanly about others and their kids can create a positive environment for their family?*** What I ve noticed in my own","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1023707221\">***I was wondering if people who talk meanly about others and their kids can <br/>\ncreate <br/>\na positive environment for their family?***<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve noticed in my own thinking, is that I CAN phrase things in negative <br/>\nways or positive ways.  How I frame a thought or idea is very much about my own <br/>\npersonal interpretation or perception.  That&#39;s true for seeing learning <br/>\nhappening.  If I only choose to see learning in the same way school does, I <br/>\nwon&#39;t be able to unschool well.  If I choose to see my child in a negative view, <br/>\nit feels the same to me as only seeing learning the same way school does.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t need to ignore the fact that a child hitting another child is something <br/>\nto discourage.  It doesn&#39;t mean the child is bad or terrible, but that she needs <br/>\nhelp communicating in another way.  If my immediate perception is that the child <br/>\nis bad or terrible, it colors my feelings and thoughts and words toward that <br/>\nchild.  If my immediate perception is that the child needs to find another way <br/>\nto communicate and is doing something damaging, it helps me see that child in a <br/>\nway that can be helpful rather than hurtful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat attitude can be applied to any distasteful child hood behavior.  Rather <br/>\nthan say hurtful things about that child or feel hurtful thoughts and put those <br/>\nout there, it has been incredibly helpful to see my children as wonderful people <br/>\nthat need help with something.<br/>\n<br/>\nI choose to see the good in my kids and most people.  I choose to see the good <br/>\nin the world.

For me, changing the words was pivotal to changing the actions (or &quot;REactions&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the beginning, I needed that space, that pause, to re-form &quot;teach&quot; to &quot;learn&quot; in my mind, for example.  It really was like a pause button on a tape player. I&#39;d stop, shift, and start again coming from a place more inline with where I wanted to be. Taking the time to examine my words helped solidify the vision of where I wanted to go. Did I want to work towards partnership and trust or did I want to reinforce the same old shit? A lot of it was action, but most of that action started with thoughts, which for me, are formed with words.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my favorite theorists is Jacques Lacan. I had this quote on my refrigerator for years: &quot;the world of words . . . creates the world of things.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know exactly which board you&#39;re referring to Alex, but I know I&#39;ve seen some descriptions of children lately that make me wince too.  I feel like a nag sometimes for pointing it out, like the woman who keeps telling people to stop calling her &quot;babe.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t necessarily related to how we talk about children, but it is related to the power of words on reality: A number of years ago I ran a few creative writing workshops for a peace organization that brought Palestinian and Israeli children together. I worked with the adults, not the kids.  One of the first things I learned was that in the group, for everyone to feel okay about talking to each other, it had long ago been decided that the countries we know as Israel, the West Bank and Gaza would be called &quot;The Region.&quot;  I&#39;m a very left-leaning non-zionist  Jew, yet the thought that calling/naming Israel Israel created, for some people, the reality of their oppression, had never occurred to me. Intellectually, I&#39;d explored many facets of the Israel/Palestine issue, but even with that Lacan quote on my fridge, I failed to see how borders are drawn with language.
