We share custody with a pretty flexible visitation<br/>\nschedule that floats around depending on finances and what works for Draven<br/>\n(the 11 y/o) and everyone else at the time.  When he&#39;s here we are radical<br/>\nunschoolers, up there he has more rules and rigidity in his life but this<br/>\nlast visit his father didn&#39;t require any school work (and he possibly won&#39;t<br/>\nfrom here on out).<br/>\n<br/>\nDraven got back from a 4 month visit with his dad a few days ago and it<br/>\ndawned on me tonight that while he&#39;s happily continuing to unschool here in<br/>\nour home, I&#39;m in serious need of deschooling again.  Today I asked if he<br/>\nwanted to do madlibs with me, not because I thought it would be fun, but<br/>\nbecause I wanted to cover grammar, and while he was helping with dinner I<br/>\nwanted him to use the analog clock to time the french fries even after he<br/>\npointed out that setting his cell phone alarm would be much easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been unschooling for going on 3 years now and most of the time it just<br/>\nis . . . . I don&#39;t have to think about it.  Today while I wasn&#39;t thinking I<br/>\nwas doing many things I wasn&#39;t supposed to be doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m finding myself trying to quantify the time I&#39;ve missed with him while he<br/>\nwas gone I think.  His feet are this much bigger, he&#39;s this much taller, and<br/>\nperhaps I&#39;m trying to find out if he&#39;s learned this or that or forgotten<br/>\nthis or that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see the difference in him though.  I bought the Mad Libs book 5 years ago<br/>\nor so and I think we&#39;ve done 2 of the stories in all that time.  Today we<br/>\nsat and did quite a few of them together.  Even though I brought it up for<br/>\nthe wrong reasons, he was able to see it as fun and not something to make<br/>\nhim read or something to make him write.
