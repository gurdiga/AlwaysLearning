That seems to be the most<br/>\nimportant thing to establish before any moves are made. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, but they don&#39;t see it going well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dad&#39;s main tactic is &quot;We&#39;ll talk about this later,&quot; or &quot;I need to think <br/>\nabout that&quot; (if she asks a direct question like &quot;What are your priorities?&quot;)  <br/>\nBut he never gets back to her on any of it.  Later doesn&#39;t come.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; If it is clear to<br/>\nhim that what ever ill-conceived power struggle he is having with the kids<br/>\nwill cost him the family he will either change because he values them (wife<br/>\nand kids) or he won&#39;t and she will know what little value she and the kids<br/>\nare to him and hopefully move on to doing whatever is necessary to protect<br/>\nthem. It has to come to this or it will only get worse.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey talked last night.  She called me to say they were done and she was fine <br/>\nand she&#39;d tell me how it went later.  It was 12:30.  I&#39;d told her I would be <br/>\nup late, but by that point I was asleep, so I&#39;ll learn more today.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel really sorry for the stress.  Her plan was to start off talking about <br/>\nhis health and saying she was worried, and depending how that went decide <br/>\nwhich route to go.  So she had no good clear plan, because she doesn&#39;t know <br/>\nwhether to take the &quot;for better or worse&quot; route if he IS having physical or <br/>\nmental or emotional problems, or whether to do the &quot;I will protect my <br/>\nchildren&quot; route if he&#39;s hostile.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure makes me appreciate Keith!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nOur project today is making orc balls for Marty, for his birthday.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis birthday party is from noon on on Tuesday, his 14-on-the-14th birthday.  <br/>\nHis plan is to play orc ball, with boffers, and he asked for an orc ball.  <br/>\nWhat he wanted was a fake-fur covered ball.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI got four playground balls at Toys&#39;R Us and we are decorating them all.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne will be &quot;Wilson goes Hawaiian&quot; (even though it&#39;s not really a &quot;Wilson&quot; <br/>\nball, but a yellow foursquare ball) with a Wilson face and a green wig and a <br/>\nplastic little-kid hula skirt.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor one I bought a full-head angry golf-ball mask.  Keith&#39;s gluing that to a <br/>\nball, and we&#39;re going to glue on Holly&#39;s long black witch wig.  That will get <br/>\nmessed up in no time from dirt and sticks and parts of tumbleweed, but the <br/>\nimportant thing is it will look marvelous when he first pulls it out of the <br/>\nbox.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne has a curly rainbow clown wig which fit exactly on half, on a green ball, <br/>\nand we put it so the red logo was like a clown nose.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fourth will have the fake fur he had hoped for.  That will be the &quot;real&quot; <br/>\none, but they&#39;ll all have grabbable parts.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe game involves some hitting the ball (along the ground) and some grabbing <br/>\nit and taking off rugby-style until you&#39;re hit with padded swords until <br/>\nyou&#39;re &quot;dead&quot; and have to drop it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty made two new boffer swords yesterday and might make two more this <br/>\nweekend.  He&#39;ll lend all the kids boffers, and three SCA guys (adults, <br/>\nknights) have also been invited, one of whom is his godfather (and grew up <br/>\nCatholic, so he actually cares), one of whom has been to at least half of <br/>\nMarty&#39;s birthdays and was Keith&#39;s squire years ago, and another who was one <br/>\nof my students and knows Marty really well.  He&#39;ll need enough boffers to <br/>\nlend them if they&#39;re here for the orc ball games too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were using contact cement in the bedroom.  BAD PLAN.  I opened the one <br/>\nwindow we have and put a fan in it, turned off the heater, and went away.  <br/>\nI&#39;m going to get a low-temp glue gun to finish my Wilson ball, because I was <br/>\ngetting sick and felt the brain damage happening.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith seems impervious to old meat or brain damage by killer glue.  If food <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t smell exactly wonderful, I can&#39;t eat it at all.    And after that <br/>\nglue today all our food smelled horrible.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo anyway summary:  <br/>\nKeith&#39;s  nice, it&#39;s fun to dress balls up as people&#39;s cartoonish severed <br/>\nheads with him, and I hope my friend&#39;s marital emergency doesn&#39;t go too <br/>\nhorribly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11545,"nextTopicId":11599}}
