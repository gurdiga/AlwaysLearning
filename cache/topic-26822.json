There<br/>\nare new laws re home education coming into force next year (07) in our state<br/>\nand so the new government body - sorry I can&#39;t think of the name  but<br/>\nsomething official sounding like HomeSchooling Support Board - is<br/>\nencouraging people to register and making it quite easy from the sounds of<br/>\nit.  Victoria is going through changes at the moment. NSW sounds fairly easy<br/>\nto register (or not!).  South Australia sounds okay as well - Beverly Paines<br/>\nsite is a good place to look for SA information.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving said that there are a large number of unregistered home educators in<br/>\nmy state and a fair few of them are unschoolers or natural learners.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some links for you:-<br/>\n<br/>\nHEA Australia - a good starting point - links to people around Australia<br/>\nwww.hea.asn.au<br/>\n<br/>\nEducation Choices - this is a magazine site but has a link to a blog by<br/>\nEleanor Sparkes - Eleanor is very active in keeping up to date on the legal<br/>\nside of home ed in Queensland.
