My mother-in-law&#39;s name was still carved into a picnic table at the shelter.  There is even a Silver Crags punch they made up that we all drink to this day.  We have a huge picture of the place hanging over our couch.   Framed along with a picture of his great grandparents, a post card they sent out at Christmas with the same picture on it, and a current picture of the gate post with Silver Crags on it.
