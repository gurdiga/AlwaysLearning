If the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-178447522\">We have visitors who have food restrictions and often seem to be hungry when <br/>\nthey arrive, although I know they have lots of good food at their meals. If <br/>\nthe kids start asking for foods that seem iffy, I am lucky enough that <br/>\ngenerally I can ask them to check in with their mother across the courtyard <br/>\nwhether it is ok. Again I have been lucky because usually it has been fine, <br/>\nand I think it gives the other mom reassurance - especially since her son <br/>\nhas said in the past that he isn&#39;t supposed to eat some sweet thing or other <br/>\nbut intended to sneak it at our house and lie about it at home. I told him I <br/>\nwasn&#39;t comfortable with that, and that I wanted his mom to be comfortable <br/>\ntoo. On the other hand Jayn has her basket of candy and chocolates from <br/>\nHalloween and seems to be frequently distributing them to the kids, and I <br/>\nhave a feeling that the mom might disapprove if she saw the volume - but it <br/>\nis kinda under my radar and in passing, while not being a covert operation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been times when I have called a mom to check about a range of <br/>\nfoods just to be sure, but that was mostly when both Jayn and her friends <br/>\nwere younger. The older they all get, the more I adopt the policy of asking <br/>\nvisitors what they would like. It is amazing to me that adults are trying to <br/>\ncontrol the food intake of a 12 year old who is out and about in the world. <br/>\nWhat a way to make exercise despised by the kid!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other idea I had if the cache of protein bars practice ends up failing <br/>\nmight be to discuss the food issue for your own daughter from the point of <br/>\nview of low blood sugar as a medical condition. I don&#39;t know if your own <br/>\ndoctor has made any recommendations about the frequency or caloric level for <br/>\nyour daughter that you could then pass on with the authority of medical <br/>\nexperts behind it. Or perhaps slightly vaguer &quot;We&#39;ve learnt that it&#39;s very <br/>\nimportant for dd to avoid hypoglycemia so I&#39;m sending her over with a snack <br/>\nbag of approved foods for her to eat when she feels her blood sugar level <br/>\nslipping.&quot; You don&#39;t necessarily need to say that you have learned it from <br/>\nobservation or that you are the food approver.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn comes home with stories of the practices in other homes that she <br/>\nclearly thinks are head shakingly odd. For example one mom only puts about <br/>\nan inch of liquid in her kid&#39;s glasses and according to Jayn they can&#39;t ask <br/>\nfor more. I think it is because the kids are clumsy (I know this from <br/>\nobservation at our house) and she is trying to avoid endless spillage clean <br/>\nup. But to Jayn it has translated into not being allowed to ask for more <br/>\n(shades of Oliver). To me the whole thing could be avoided by using a lidded <br/>\ncup with a straw, which is what I do.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the help of people here I am learning to trust that Jayn will be ok <br/>\neven if she occasionally goes into a poor environment, and from my own <br/>\nexperience I know I absolutely can&#39;t control another mom and it is futile to <br/>\ntry, regardless of how much sense I might be making. If Jayn is willing to <br/>\nput up with nonsense for the sake of spending time with friends, then she <br/>\nwill be alright, and perhaps eventually she will decide that it&#39;s too much <br/>\ntrouble to be worth it. I know that it is hard when crankiness and bad mood <br/>\nand unpleasant stress releasing behaviors are then brought home, but I like <br/>\nthe suggestion of having food in the car.

My kids usually ask me <br/>\nto make them stuff. It&#39;s funny because I buy mostly organic and whole <br/>\nfoods and do a fair amount of cooking, but nothing especially fancy <br/>\nor rich. I make simple stuff without many processed ingredients. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t believe artificial sweetners and low fat/no fat stuff are <br/>\nhealthy, so I don&#39;t buy it. They don&#39;t seem to feed their dd all day <br/>\nand then have a &quot;normal&quot; dinner.  They have never asked me to not <br/>\nfeed their dd, but they always interrogate her as to what she ate and <br/>\nhow much (by phone) at regualr intervals.  There have been several <br/>\nnotable incidents where the Mom tried to control what dd would eat - <br/>\nonce at a party I had at my home. She brought juice for A to drink <br/>\ndespite the fact that I had juice on hand. The goal, I concluded, was <br/>\nto prevent her from drinking soda, something A loves. Didn&#39;t work. <br/>\nAnd almost escalated into a scene. Another incident involved A eating <br/>\na few pieces of hard candy at my house and the Mom freaked out (yes, <br/>\nyelling and screaming and out of control) in my home in front of me <br/>\nand the girls. At the time, I was too shocked to respond. And after, <br/>\nI had no clue what to say. That was the last straw for me and the <br/>\npoint where I started distancing myself from her.

The encouragement is <br/>\ncomforting! I liked they way you said that - &quot;the act of helping, <br/>\nhelped.&quot; I&#39;m trying hard to expand my dd&#39;s opportinities for social <br/>\nconnections through her interests and I think, down the road, it will <br/>\nhelp her feel more independent of this best friend.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I wouldn&#39;t.

Can you give an <br/>\nexample as to how they deal with each other? My dd feels she can&#39;t <br/>\ntalk to A about the food and control stuff (maybe they are still too <br/>\nyoung to identify/verbalize stuff like that?).  I see A starting a <br/>\nlot of attention-seeking behaviors and worry about her future. A has <br/>\nnot made any close friends besides my dd.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Your daughter is right, don&#39;t say anything more to this mom.  Your<br/>\n&gt; daughter is 12 and I assume her friend is too.  That is an age,<br/>\n&gt; especially if they are in school, where they change friends a lot <br/>\n&gt;and find social niches that are comfortable.  They may grow apart <br/>\n&gt;simply because of that aspect alone.  It may not seem as if they <br/>\n&gt;will, but in a year, at that age, kids change a lot and really fast.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My daughter usually is right! Yes, they are both 12 and will turn 13 <br/>\nin March/May next year.  I&#39;ll try to remind myself of this when I get <br/>\nbogged down in the Mom&#39;s controlling behaviours.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; When I was trying to find answers for us, people suggested doing <br/>\n&gt;things, getting out, changing the focus.  The focus was really <br/>\n&gt;wanting to be with that friend and nothing else would do, so it was <br/>\n&gt;hard and my daughter was uncooperative about it, pining for her <br/>\n&gt;friend.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve considered Sandra&#39;s suggestion to get the girls out doing things <br/>\nnot at home, however, the Mom is reluctant to allow this.  That is, <br/>\nshe&#39;s fine taking my dd places, but doesn&#39;t like me taking her dd <br/>\nanywhere. My dd likes to be at their house because they have lots of <br/>\ncool stuff.  The reason A doesn&#39;t spend the night with us anymore is <br/>\nbecause of her &quot;allergies.&quot; I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s real or something <br/>\nher Mom made up. My dd really misses A because she&#39;s so unavailable <br/>\nwith school and homework.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hindsight, though, I really believe that getting out with a little <br/>\n&gt;force helped a lot.  It was hard to push her, but it can be done in <br/>\n&gt;little ways and lots of encouragement. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Dd is enjoying our unschooling group and the co-op, which hasn&#39;t <br/>\nproduced any new best friends, but does give her lots of social <br/>\ninteraction and things to talk about. It&#39;s helping. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It will pass.  Be patient and gentle and kind to your daughter and <br/>\n&gt;your daughter&#39;s friend.  You do have the advantage that you guys can <br/>\n&gt;still see this friend, don&#39;t do anything to change that.  If you <br/>\n&gt;lose contact,all of you guys lose, especially the other girl who <br/>\n&gt;won&#39;t have anywhere to escape from the yucky controlling existence <br/>\n&gt;at her own home.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks, I need the reminder. I&#39;m doing okay ... mostly I struggle <br/>\nwith the damage the mom is doing to her dd.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Chamille also decided that she wasn&#39;t ok with going over to her <br/>\n&gt;friend&#39;s house.  For a while she put up with the yucky atmosphere to <br/>\n&gt;be with her friend.  It got to the point where she couldn&#39;t and <br/>\n&gt;wouldn&#39;t tolerate being around a complete jerk, even if it was to <br/>\n&gt;see her friend.  That worked in her favor too.  It also helps that <br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m willing to do ALL the driving and pay for things, it took away <br/>\n&gt;the first front of excuses for saying &quot;no&quot; to invites. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad you shared this ... it&#39;s interesting what kids choose over <br/>\ntime.  I suspect A will want to get away from her parents more and <br/>\nmore and if she spends more time with us, it will work to the girls <br/>\nadvantage.

I<br/>\nthink I would just try to find a way to support their friendship and<br/>\nyour daughter as well as you can in less than ideal circumstances.<br/>\nLimiting food at home during visits might be the best way to do<br/>\nthat... and at least then they are with you, not the controlling mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had something sort of like this come up with a friend of my<br/>\ndaughter&#39;s who has very limited TV access and it just seems to work<br/>\nbest to stay within her mom&#39;s limits.  My daughter would rather have<br/>\nher friend over with the TV off most of the time than not see her<br/>\nfriend.<br/>\n<br/>\nMargaret<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sun, Nov 30, 2008 at 9:02 AM, Keti Carazo &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:keti@...\">keti@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi, my name is Keti and I&#39;ve been reading on this list for several<br/>\n&gt; months now at the suggestion of a good friend who has unschooled for<br/>\n&gt; many years. I enjoy reading and learning and hearing the multiple<br/>\n&gt; perspectives shared here. I have two kids: ds is 17 and dd is 12.<br/>\n&gt; We have attended two L&L conferences. The kids have been home for<br/>\n&gt; three plus years and we have been walking the path of unschooling for<br/>\n&gt; about a year and a half, enjoying life and watching everyone thrive.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I really need some perspective on a difficult long-standing<br/>\n&gt; situation. It relates to my dd&#39;s best friend, A, a girl she met in<br/>\n&gt; third grade. A is a cool kid and dd enjoys the relationship. She&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; in school and her family is very entrenched in the &quot;culture of<br/>\n&gt; school&quot; to the point where they view it as the one and ONLY way. The<br/>\n&gt; mom has never overtly said she disapproves of how my kids are getting<br/>\n&gt; an education, nor has she ever asked what we do, however, there is a<br/>\n&gt; clear feeling of judgment and disapproval coming from her.<br/>\n&gt; Consequently, we have distanced ourselves from the family socially<br/>\n&gt; while allowing my dd and A to continue their friendship. A is<br/>\n&gt; completely controlled by her Mom. She&#39;s overweight and they control<br/>\n&gt; her food and drink. Couple of years ago the Mom and I had a<br/>\n&gt; conversation around the &quot;weight problem&quot; and she acknowledged that<br/>\n&gt; she herself has major food issues. I suggested then that perhaps<br/>\n&gt; some counseling for the Mom would be an option. She seemed open to<br/>\n&gt; that idea, said she had already considered it, etc. But, then the<br/>\n&gt; wall of denial came up and nothing ever happened … the simply<br/>\n&gt; continued controlling A. Time passed. I could see that they were<br/>\n&gt; not committed to doing anything different and began to distance<br/>\n&gt; myself from them. A has a lot of health problems … earlier this year<br/>\n&gt; they thought it was asthma, but instead it seems to have been anxiety<br/>\n&gt; attacks at … school. No surprise there. All that said, here&#39;s my<br/>\n&gt; problem.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When A spends time at our house, we let her eat and drink what she<br/>\n&gt; wants. Consequently, they don&#39;t want A to be at our house. So, the<br/>\n&gt; only way my daughter can spend time with A is at their house. I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; uncomfortable with the arrangement … they require the kids to jump on<br/>\n&gt; the trampoline after eating and other ridiculous things. They also<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t feed my daughter enough food (and apple or a cereal bar is<br/>\n&gt; considered lunch). She comes home with low blood sugar and extremely<br/>\n&gt; irritated. My daughter doesn&#39;t mind the forced &quot;exercise&quot; but she<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t like what they are willing to feed her. If she sleeps over,<br/>\n&gt; I usually give her a few protein bars so she has SOMETHING to eat,<br/>\n&gt; which helps. As an inside joke, my dd and I call their<br/>\n&gt; home &quot;starvation house.&quot; She&#39;s willing to tolerate this behavior so<br/>\n&gt; she can see her friend. It&#39;s so incredibly sad and heartbreaking.<br/>\n&gt; In the past, I&#39;ve discussed with the mom that my daughter is a<br/>\n&gt; growing girl and she eats a LOT of food and needs it while her body<br/>\n&gt; is developing and that she&#39;s been hungry at their house. Still,<br/>\n&gt; nothing changes. Sometimes they &quot;forget&quot; to feed the girls. The<br/>\n&gt; girls get together much less frequently and the sleepovers are even<br/>\n&gt; more rare, namely because A always has homework to do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have been actively seeking outlets for my daughter to meet new<br/>\n&gt; friends for the last two years. I started a local unschooling group<br/>\n&gt; and we joined a local co-op. Both of these are new ventures and<br/>\n&gt; she&#39;s not met any girls around her age. We talk about the situation<br/>\n&gt; quite a bit and my daughter struggles with A and her limitations. We<br/>\n&gt; both very much want for her to develop friends with other unschooled<br/>\n&gt; or relaxed homeschooled kids. Just hasn&#39;t happened yet. My dd has<br/>\n&gt; talked about getting back into dance classes and I&#39;m optimistic that<br/>\n&gt; will give her some exposure to new girls to befriend. We&#39;ll probably<br/>\n&gt; start this in January.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Given this background, is it worth it for me to, either verbally or<br/>\n&gt; in writing, broach the subject of controls again (e.g., where is<br/>\n&gt; affects me and my daughter, like the trampoline or going hungry) with<br/>\n&gt; the Mom?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d like to tell her how disrespectful it is to constantly call A<br/>\n&gt; when she&#39;s out with us and ask her what she ate, where she is, what<br/>\n&gt; she&#39;s doing, etc. This happened twice last night in a three hour<br/>\n&gt; period – it was a very rare occasion when A came to dinner with us.<br/>\n&gt; I think the girls are good enough friends that they won&#39;t grow apart<br/>\n&gt; anytime soon, so these situations will continue to come up. I&#39;m very<br/>\n&gt; tired of saying or doing nothing … it&#39;s a constant source of<br/>\n&gt; frustration and bad feelings for both me and my daughter. My<br/>\n&gt; daughter is afraid that if I say something, the mom won&#39;t be able to<br/>\n&gt; handle it and will not allow A to spend time with her at all. I<br/>\n&gt; seriously need suggestions on either how to speak up to the mom (and<br/>\n&gt; not care about the outcome) and/or how to deal with my overwhelming<br/>\n&gt; feelings and find workarounds to specific situations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kindly,<br/>\n&gt; Keti<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Intro & dealing with controlling mom of dd&#39;s friend","postDate":"1228173675","msgId":40679,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM4OTI1NzI1LTQ2REEtNDlFQi1CMDk3LURBMURDNTgxMTdBOUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdoMWo1aStkaWplQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdoMWo1aStkaWplQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40678,"nextInTopic":40680,"prevInTime":40678,"nextInTime":40680,"topicId":40648,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I wouldn t answer the phone.

I was forced into a situation that I couldn&#39;t avoid with<br/>\nthe parent of the best friend of my daughter, otherwise, I would&#39;ve let<br/>\nit go.

Your<br/>\ndaughter is 12 and I assume her friend is too.  That is an age,<br/>\nespecially if they are in school, where they change friends a lot and<br/>\nfind social niches that are comfortable.  They may grow apart simply<br/>\nbecause of that aspect alone.  It may not seem as if they will, but in a<br/>\nyear, at that age, kids change a lot and really fast.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know exactly how you are feeling.  I took a while to respond to this<br/>\nemail, simply because I really can feel your pain, we&#39;ve been there! <br/>\nWhen I was trying to find answers for us, people suggested doing things,<br/>\ngetting out, changing the focus.  The focus was really wanting to be<br/>\nwith that friend and nothing else would do, so it was hard and my<br/>\ndaughter was uncooperative about it, pining for her friend.<br/>\n<br/>\nHindsight, though, I really believe that getting out with a little force<br/>\nhelped a lot.  It was hard to push her, but it can be done in little<br/>\nways and lots of encouragement.  Letting my daughter react how she<br/>\nwanted, be who she wanted to be, encouraging her other intersts, all<br/>\nhelped in small ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will pass.  Be patient and gentle and kind to your daughter and your<br/>\ndaughter&#39;s friend.  You do have the advantage that you guys can still<br/>\nsee this friend, don&#39;t do anything to change that.  If you lose contact,<br/>\nall of you guys lose, especially the other girl who won&#39;t have anywhere<br/>\nto escape from the yucky controlling existence at her own home.  That<br/>\nwas the worst part for us, the dad routinely grounded his daughter from<br/>\nmy daughter, still does, but the initial really bad grounding lasted<br/>\nmonths.  When we were finally able to circumvent that by getting in<br/>\ncontact with the mom who has visits on the weekends, things changed a<br/>\nlittle because the dad realized he couldn&#39;t control everything.  He<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t keep his daughter from seeing her friend, and the grounding<br/>\ndidn&#39;t count as much or last as long.<br/>\n<br/>\nChamille also decided that she wasn&#39;t ok with going over to her friend&#39;s<br/>\nhouse.  For a while she put up with the yucky atmosphere to be with her<br/>\nfriend.  It got to the point where she couldn&#39;t and wouldn&#39;t tolerate<br/>\nbeing around a complete jerk, even if it was to see her friend.  That<br/>\nworked in her favor too.  It also helps that I&#39;m willing to do ALL the<br/>\ndriving and pay for things, it took away the first front of excuses for<br/>\nsaying &quot;no&quot; to invites.  And, last, but not least, since the dad and I<br/>\naren&#39;t on speaking terms, my husband will call and negotiate for the<br/>\ngirls.  Since my husband wasn&#39;t involved in the confrontation, and he&#39;s<br/>\na man, he carries more weight in that dynamic.

I enjoy","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2135581896\">Hi, my name is Keti and I&#39;ve been reading on this list for several <br/>\nmonths now at the suggestion of a good friend who has unschooled for <br/>\nmany years.  I enjoy reading and learning and hearing the multiple <br/>\nperspectives shared here.  I have two kids: ds is 17 and dd is 12.  <br/>\nWe have attended two L&L conferences. The kids have been home for <br/>\nthree plus years and we have been walking the path of unschooling for <br/>\nabout a year and a half, enjoying life and watching everyone thrive. <br/>\n<br/>\nI really need some perspective on a difficult long-standing <br/>\nsituation.  It relates to my dd&#39;s best friend, A, a girl she met in <br/>\nthird grade.  A is a cool kid and dd enjoys the relationship.  She&#39;s <br/>\nin school and her family is very entrenched in the &quot;culture of <br/>\nschool&quot; to the point where they view it as the one and ONLY way.  The <br/>\nmom has never overtly said she disapproves of how my kids are getting <br/>\nan education, nor has she ever asked what we do, however, there is a <br/>\nclear feeling of judgment and  disapproval coming from her. <br/>\nConsequently, we have distanced ourselves from the family socially <br/>\nwhile allowing my dd and A to continue their friendship.  A is <br/>\ncompletely controlled by her Mom.  She&#39;s overweight and they control <br/>\nher food and drink. Couple of years ago the Mom and I had a <br/>\nconversation around the &quot;weight problem&quot; and she acknowledged that <br/>\nshe herself has major food issues.  I suggested then that perhaps <br/>\nsome counseling for the Mom would be an option.  She seemed open to <br/>\nthat idea, said she had already considered it, etc.  But, then the <br/>\nwall of denial came up and nothing ever happened  the simply <br/>\ncontinued controlling A.  Time passed.  I could see that they were <br/>\nnot committed to doing anything different and began to distance <br/>\nmyself from them.  A has a lot of health problems  earlier this year <br/>\nthey thought it was asthma, but instead it seems to have been anxiety <br/>\nattacks at  school.  No surprise there.  All that said, here&#39;s my <br/>\nproblem. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen A spends time at our house, we let her eat and drink what she <br/>\nwants.  Consequently, they don&#39;t want A to be at our house.  So,  the <br/>\nonly way my daughter can spend time with A is at their house.  I&#39;m  <br/>\nuncomfortable with the arrangement  they require the kids to jump on <br/>\nthe trampoline after eating and other ridiculous things.  They also <br/>\ndon&#39;t feed my daughter enough food (and apple or a cereal bar is <br/>\nconsidered lunch).  She comes home with low blood sugar and extremely <br/>\nirritated. My daughter doesn&#39;t mind the forced &quot;exercise&quot; but she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like what they are willing to feed her.  If she sleeps over, <br/>\nI usually give her a few protein bars so she has SOMETHING to eat, <br/>\nwhich helps. As an inside joke, my dd and I call their <br/>\nhome &quot;starvation house.&quot;  She&#39;s willing to tolerate this behavior so <br/>\nshe can see her friend.  It&#39;s so incredibly sad and heartbreaking.  <br/>\nIn the past, I&#39;ve discussed with the mom that my daughter is a <br/>\ngrowing girl and she eats a LOT of food and needs it while her body <br/>\nis developing and that she&#39;s been hungry at their house.  Still, <br/>\nnothing changes.  Sometimes they &quot;forget&quot; to feed the girls.  The <br/>\ngirls get together much less frequently and the sleepovers are even <br/>\nmore rare, namely because A always has homework to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been actively seeking outlets for my daughter to meet new <br/>\nfriends for the last two years.  I started a local unschooling group <br/>\nand we joined a local co-op.  Both of these are new ventures and <br/>\nshe&#39;s not met any girls around her age.  We talk about the situation <br/>\nquite a bit and my daughter struggles with A and her limitations. We <br/>\nboth very much want for her to develop friends with other unschooled <br/>\nor relaxed homeschooled kids.  Just hasn&#39;t happened yet.  My dd has <br/>\ntalked about getting back into dance classes and I&#39;m optimistic that <br/>\nwill give her some exposure to new girls to befriend.  We&#39;ll probably <br/>\nstart this in January.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven this background, is it worth it for me to, either verbally or <br/>\nin writing, broach the subject of controls again (e.g., where is <br/>\naffects me and my daughter, like the trampoline or going hungry) with <br/>\nthe Mom?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to tell her how disrespectful it is to constantly call A <br/>\nwhen she&#39;s out with us and ask her what she ate, where she is, what <br/>\nshe&#39;s doing, etc.  This happened twice last night in a three hour <br/>\nperiod  it was a very rare occasion when A came to dinner with us.  <br/>\nI think the girls are good enough friends that they won&#39;t grow apart <br/>\nanytime soon, so these situations will continue to come up.  I&#39;m very <br/>\ntired of saying or doing nothing  it&#39;s a constant source of <br/>\nfrustration and bad feelings for both me and my daughter.  My <br/>\ndaughter is afraid that if I say something, the mom won&#39;t be able to <br/>\nhandle it and will not allow A to spend time with her at all.  I <br/>\nseriously need suggestions on either how to speak up to the mom (and <br/>\nnot care about the outcome) and/or how to deal with my overwhelming <br/>\nfeelings and  find workarounds to specific situations.   <br/>\n<br/>\nKindly,<br/>\nKeti</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40666,"nextTopicId":40726}}
