(Don Marquis)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a great deal of school-surround that involves creating the  <br/>\nimpression that parents, teachers and students are being thoughtful  <br/>\nand making decisions.  They are given options and they weigh them with  <br/>\ngravity, and feel good about their choices.  The choices are something  <br/>\nlike military or college, or which college, or what major.   If  <br/>\nmilitary, then what branch of the service, or will one go to college  <br/>\nand join an officers&#39; training program and THEN go to the military?    <br/>\nIt seems like a world of choices if you nose is on the recruiting  <br/>\nposters and if your choice that day had been to stay in class or go to  <br/>\nthe recruiting session in the gym.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to unschooling and the quote though,   &quot;If you make people think  <br/>\nthey&#39;re thinking, they&#39;ll love you&quot; reminds me of a sales room at a  <br/>\nlarge homeschooling conference, with all the vendors and different  <br/>\ncurriculae.

His parents, according to this article, came back from Mongolia and set up an equine therapy ranch and &quot;homeschool&quot; for children with disabilities.  I love that the title of this article includes &quot;encourage exploration.&quot;  Am not sure what a homeschool for a group of children means exactly.  But at least  we know the parents have taken a step away from traditional school for their son and are offering support to others who want to do the same.  Perhaps it is even more like unschooling that schooling at home.  Might be interesting to find out...am not sure how one totally unschools a child with lower functioning autism, though, and grapple myself with this idea because the child is not motivated to learn in the same way that a typical child is and  sometimes is quite content  NOT to explore his/her surroundings.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, parents of children with autism, because their lives can be so &quot;abnormal,&quot; want, even more than the average parent, their child to experience the &quot;normalcy&quot; of going to school.  Maybe it is less about the quality of education and more about simply wanting the choice to do what everyone else is doing. It&#39;s one thing to have a typically functioning child and choose to educate him/her differently, and quite another to have your choices limited because your child is not welcome.  Also, the unfounded fear that taking a child out of school might limit him socially is doubly hard for a parent of a child with autism to come to terms with because the child is already suffering socially.  This is perhaps why the Isaacson&#39;s have invited other homeschoolers to join them at their home--to be sure Rowan has other children with whom to interact.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re so right in that there is no proof that anything these people have done has helped their son mature.  But at least they&#39;re adventurously experimenting by offering him the chance to have fun in the real world with real (potentially scary) animals rather than locking him in an office with a therapist. It sounds like they&#39;ve also questioned the effects of &quot;regular&quot; school on their son.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Isaacson&#39;s are likely doing their best they can with what they know/have in some very difficult circumstances. <br/>\n<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny C","from":"&quot;Jenny C&quot; &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Scientific revolutions, was Physical appearance","postDate":"1246218122","msgId":46092,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGgyOGgyYSthaGFzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJEMzE5ODUxLUVCQjgtNDkxOC05RjFBLTk4NUYzNTJCQTFBN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":46091,"nextInTopic":46093,"prevInTime":46091,"nextInTime":46093,"topicId":46084,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

You won&#39;t feel like you&#39;re on vacation if you  <br/>\nhave to do laundry and wash dirty dishes, so book a room somewhere.<br/>\nAvoid your usual places.  Get your coffee at a different cafe, eat at  <br/>\na new ethnic joint, go for a walk in an unfamiliar park.  The goal is  <br/>\nto &quot;discover hidden gems.&quot;<br/>\nCheck tourist sites for festivals, poetry readings, music performances  <br/>\nand outdoor movie screenings--stuff you might otherwise be oblivious to.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor years haven&#39;t I and others on this list been saying &quot;go to a  <br/>\ndifferent store; eat where you&#39;ve never eaten&quot;?  Drive different ways  <br/>\nwhen you travel.  When people have needed to reconnect with a child,  <br/>\nI&#39;ve said do an overnight trip to another town, stay in a motel, do  <br/>\nsomething just the two of you.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now it&#39;s more mainstream advice, even for people without kids. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo articles talked about school, in passing, in ways that assumed no  <br/>\noptions.  A kid who used to be on TV shows and movies disappeared at  <br/>\nthe age of 18, two years ago.  The family had lived in southern  <br/>\nCalifornia, but the parents had taken him back to Washington State to  <br/>\nfinish high school, and the mom said he was &quot;...heartbroken.  But he  <br/>\nunderstood that we needed to go home.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow he&#39;s dead or gone or run away, but the family &quot;NEEDED&quot; to take him  <br/>\naway from Burbank because Burbank high school wouldn&#39;t let him  <br/>\ntransfer credits from wherever-in-Washington unless he enrolled full  <br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nHOW did high school become more important than well-paying full time  <br/>\nemployment?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn an article about Chris Pine who played Captain Kirk in the new star  <br/>\ntrek movie, it says<br/>\n&quot;Pine graduated from U.C. Berkeley with an English degree in 2002 and  <br/>\nthen worked as a restaurant server before landing his breakout role in  <br/>\n2004&#39;s The Princess Diaries 2.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat paragraph was headed &quot;He&#39;s got brains too.&quot;<br/>\nWere brains proven by graduating with an English degree?<br/>\nWas an English degree helpul in working as a restaurant server?<br/>\nHe&#39;s an actor.  Neither the English degree nor the working in a  <br/>\nrestaurant was the point of the article, but that was offered as proof  <br/>\nhe was smart.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there was one I didn&#39;t save, about an autistic boy whose parents  <br/>\ndiscovered he loved horses and started talking after he was around  <br/>\nhorses.<br/>\nThe mom mentioned school MANY times in the article, and he&#39;s just  <br/>\nlittle, like six maybe.  But at some point they took him to Mongolia  <br/>\nor somewhere to live around horses and Shamans.  So the parents could  <br/>\nafford to move to China?

Now he&#39;s back in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s no proof that just getting older helped him and the horses and  <br/>\nshamanistic healings were incidental.  Maybe it was just being with  <br/>\nhis mom, doing something SO PROFOUNDLY INTERESTING as riding horses  <br/>\nthat triggered him to speak.

He had one of those birds that dips over and  <br/>\ncomes back up, like they sell little ones of, but his was about four  <br/>\nfeet high.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I went to my friend&#39;s physics class at the university, and I was  <br/>\nplanning to go for a semester, but after two weeks I couldn&#39;t stand  <br/>\nanymore.  He enjoyed physics, himself, but for us he was reciting what  <br/>\nother people had recited to him.  We had to agree to these &quot;simple  <br/>\nexamples&quot; or proof of physical &quot;laws,&quot; and I was arguing from the  <br/>\nbeginning (not in class, but on the side with him by e-mail).   A  <br/>\nbullet fired straight up will hit the ground going as fast as when it  <br/>\nwas fired from the gun?<br/>\nThat didn&#39;t make sense to me.  A row of numbers as &quot;proof&quot; didn&#39;t make  <br/>\nit make any more sense.  A rocket returning to earth doesn&#39;t hit the  <br/>\nocean with the same force that it left the atmosphere.<br/>\nHe figured I was hopeless.  I figured physics was beyond me lame  <br/>\neveryday logic.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen the mythbusters TV show came along and took my side and said the  <br/>\nphysics number<br/>\nproof was wrong.  So what people have been paying other people to  <br/>\nteach them and give them physics degrees about was a myth?  And they  <br/>\nclaimed to believe it and consider the &quot;proof&quot; as proof, like the  <br/>\nemperor&#39;s new clothes?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother question in that physics class had to do with something  <br/>\n(water, probably) in a container, under certain conditions, and what  <br/>\nwould happen if it was cooled or heated or something, and I said  <br/>\n&quot;What&#39;s the container made of?&quot;  And he just looked at me.  That one  <br/>\nwas in class.  What the container was made of wasn&#39;t part of the  <br/>\n&quot;equation.&quot;   What!?  In what universe?  Is it steel?   Glass?   <br/>\nPlastic?  Ceramic?  So he wasn&#39;t undertanding that I thought it  <br/>\nmattered what the container was.  He said &quot;I don&#39;t see why it matters.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was stunned, but figured, still, it was my misunderstanding and not  <br/>\nhis.  I said &quot;Is it God&#39;s perfect container?&quot;  Yes, he said.  God&#39;s  <br/>\nperfect container.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo this was THEORETICAL.
