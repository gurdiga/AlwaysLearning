I<br/>\nam laughing about the &quot;granny&quot; discussion (and the crap circles, too, Deb!).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here we are:  my parents are Mimi and Bumpa (which is what I, being the<br/>\noldest grandchild, called my father&#39;s father), my in-laws are Nana and<br/>\nGrandpa, my father used to live with these folks when he was in the army who<br/>\nwere &quot;grandparent-ish&quot; and he called them Nanny and Po.  The funny thing is<br/>\nthat both my grandmothers were called Grandma (insert last name), so my<br/>\nsister called them &quot;Grandma with the teeth like mine&quot; (because my mom&#39;s mom<br/>\nhad a large gap between her front teeth...like my sister) and &quot;The Grandma<br/>\nwho eats the cores&quot;  (because my dad&#39;s mom ate her apples all the way down<br/>\nto the seeds).  I have not laughed about that in so long, thanks for the<br/>\ngiggle!!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and Betsy, I love to go to the library alone, too.  It is so nice to<br/>\njust go in, sit down, read, and walk out with stuff I can carry by myself<br/>\nwithout my imaginary personal chiropractor counting the money she&#39;ll make<br/>\noff me the next day!!<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessed be,<br/>\nDiAnna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":106031689,"authorName":"Jon and Rue Kream","from":"&quot;Jon and Rue Kream&quot; &lt;skreams@...&gt;","profile":"jonkream","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] granny and libraries","postDate":"1045682687","msgId":12413,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PCF+IVVFTkVSa1ZDTURrQUFRQUNBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUJnQUFBQUFBQUFBb3RjOXlYdVBJRXV3MzdFd2ZJRzhMTUtBQUFBUUFBQUFieGFxTmxSYkVrMnpDVmJtbng2VzJ3RUFBQUFBQGF0dGJpLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMDcwMWMyZDg0YyRkMGQ3OWE2MCQ4MTU4OTRjZUBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4="},"prevInTopic":12398,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":12412,"nextInTime":12414,"topicId":12398,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We had a Bumpa too!
