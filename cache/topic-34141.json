It wasn&#39;t rebellion.   <br/>\nShe had all the tools to  make a decision like that, and she doesn&#39;t  <br/>\ndo crazy things.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of things in life take the agreement of two or three people.

Is the potential struggle between you over this tattoo worth damaging your relationship (if that&#39;s a possibility)? Do Bob&#39;s tattoos bother you?

The main ear ones are like a spiral, and the holes are quite big.  I think the spiral is to slowly make the holes bigger and bigger.  She also has three or maybe more nose piercings, and they are not little tiny studs, but a hoop, a pointy thing, and something else...  she has one facial tattoo, and then both arms look like arm warmers, the tattoos are so colorful and cover from her wrists to  under her clothing.  She also has tattoos on her legs and I&#39;m sure elsewhere.  She is quite openly out, although I&#39;m not sure if the kids know.  She has very short spiked hair.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is changing and body art is becoming more and more acceptable.  Alexx wants a lip piercing.  I&#39;m thinking of letting her, as soon as the divorce is final.  Although I don&#39;t like how that was stated.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEarlier this year, and young girl started in my class, new student.  On day two, she has this LONG (like 8 inches) spike coming out of her lip.  It was not something that would be safe for a young person to wear in a school full of young people.  After talking to her, I discovered that she and her older sister hand pierced the lip the night before and she had to wear this for however long (months)... I was appalled that this 6th grade 11 year old had pierced her own lip.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I realize that Alexx could do this on her own.  Not that she would, I don&#39;t see her doing that.  I see us talking about, waiting for the divorce to be final so I have custody completely, and them doing research to see how and where and how to make it happen in the safest possible way, and then us going together and getting it done. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think she is thinking of a tattoo too.  I&#39;m not opposed.  As long as she breastfeeds and is not a republican, I&#39;m cool with her choices....

She knew exactly what she wanted, drew it herself.  My next is going to get one this summer; she&#39;ll be a couple months shy of 17.  In our state you can get a tattoo at 16 with parental consent.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have no concerns with either of my daughters getting tattoos.  They researched it thoroughly, are fully aware that they are considered permanent, and it was important to them.  It wasn&#39;t a spur of the moment decision - although those aren&#39;t always wrong either.  I think your daughter wanting to honor her brother in this way is beautiful; considering that it is for her brother, it&#39;s not likely that she would ever regret that.  Also, I think it&#39;s much easier to have a tattoo removed than it used to be.  I truly don&#39;t think 18 and almost 18 makes any difference.  It&#39;s only a matter of a few months.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Do you know what your main concern is with the tattoo.  Is that you are afraid she&#39;ll change her mind later on about having it?  Afraid that it&#39;ll lead to more tattoos?  Or is it that you don&#39;t care for tattoos?  I know how that can feel.  My 16 yr old dd has numerous piercings.  I don&#39;t like piercings.  It&#39;s been hard for me to support her in this, and I&#39;ve bit my tongue more times than she knows.

I&#39;m sure it <br/>\nwill be a tasteful one, too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTattoos seem to be very popular here in New Mexico -- everything from <br/>\ngang logos to a lover&#39;s name on your neck (ick) or kids&#39; <br/>\nnames/birthdates in very visible and elaborate detail.  Many are over <br/>\nthe top, and the lower back seems very popular with girls, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have friends with one or more tattoos, and my oldest son got his <br/>\nfirst tattoo at 17, with my permission and blessing (and I didn&#39;t even <br/>\nknow then what he&#39;d get). His first tat is a HUGE dragon that occupies <br/>\nvirtually all of his lower right leg. He&#39;s added a second one now, a <br/>\nNew Mexico zia (sun) sign, and is contemplating several more (he&#39;s 23, <br/>\nbtw).  <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, my feeling was I could &#39;let&#39; him get one at a quality, <br/>\nclean tattoo parlor with my oversight, and know it was safe and he&#39;d <br/>\nhave a good experience, or I could draw my line in the sand and risk <br/>\nthat he&#39;d make an unsafe choice in getting a tattoo. And if he had to <br/>\nhide it from me, what kind of aftercare would he be able to get?<br/>\n<br/>\nI had to remember, too, that my hallmark reason for unschooling my kids <br/>\nis a fervent dedication to their personal autonomy and sovereignty over <br/>\ntheir own bodies and lives. So, I said yes, told him he could spend his <br/>\ntravel money on it (he used my sister&#39;s tattoo artist during a visit to <br/>\nher home in Texas) and told my sister he had total freedom in what he <br/>\nwanted.  Hence, the very big, elaborate -- and beautiful -- gold dragon <br/>\non his leg.  He even negotiated a discount by allowing the tattoo <br/>\nartist to use the finished product in some ad layouts for his business!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll admit, too, that tattoos fascinate me. I&#39;ve thought about getting <br/>\none over the years, but I&#39;m not crazy about pain, and I have so many <br/>\nallergies I&#39;m afraid I&#39;d end up with a huge reaction under my skin!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d say let her get the tattoo. <br/>\n<br/>\nSylvia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: teens/tattoos","postDate":"1207873267","msgId":34205,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc1OTAyNi44MTg1Mi5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNi5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGZ0bWE3ZCt0NHBqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":34204,"nextInTopic":34208,"prevInTime":34204,"nextInTime":34206,"topicId":34141,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t have a tattoo or kids with tattoos but as a sister who also lost a brother I find it beautiful that she wants to have it done .

I have seen the anger, disrespect (talking very rudely, screaming,<br/>\nslamming doors etc) escalate daily. I really think a lot of it is DUE to<br/>\nall that screen time. But I do not know that is the only reason...of<br/>\ncourse there is never only 1 reason for anything, but I do feel it is<br/>\nplaying a great part in this excessive anger and rudeness. What can you<br/>\ndo about this type of thing while still allowing your teen the control<br/>\nthey want, but at the same time, keeping your home a place of respect<br/>\nand peace and keeping younger children from being emotionally upset (<br/>\nand abused!) by the whole thing??&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf unschooling and freedom are new to the family, let it go.  It will<br/>\ntake a while for people to find their comfort in the newness.  If a<br/>\nchild is used to control, it is sort of a stability of sorts to rely on.<br/>\nIf you take it away a kid might feel a little like they are floundering<br/>\nabout not knowing what to do or how to behave.  Screen time is NOT the<br/>\nissue, it could very well be the solution.  Don&#39;t interupt it, don&#39;t<br/>\nbelittle it, let it happen.  Offer things, and accept &quot;no&quot; as an answer.<br/>\nAnger and rudeness are reactionary behaviors, don&#39;t give any reason to<br/>\nreact in that way.  Do it enough times that a child can calm down and<br/>\nstop reacting.  Keep doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one has ultimate control.  Perhaps instead of seeing it as taking the<br/>\nparental control and handing it over to the child, see it as learning<br/>\nhow to navigate together, no one is in control or everyone is.  Really<br/>\nthe ONLY thing a person can control is their own behavior, pretty much<br/>\neverything else is circumstantial.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to keeping younger children safe, refer to above about directing them<br/>\nelsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Right now, counseling looks like a good one, as I feel he does not have<br/>\nthe normal filter mechanisms most of us use to control anger and<br/>\nreactions to things.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOr maybe he is reacting perfectly normal to a control based environment<br/>\nand he feels very intensly about being controlled.  I wouldn&#39;t recommend<br/>\ncounseling.  If you work for a year at happy relationship building<br/>\nwithout control and he is still having problems, then maybe counseling<br/>\ncould help.  Counseling could just be another cause of resentment over<br/>\ncontrol though.  How are you going to get him there if he doesn&#39;t want<br/>\nto go?  Really!  A counselor isn&#39;t necessarily going to help him with<br/>\nanger and stuff either.  Counselors are mostly there to listen and<br/>\ninterpret and offer advice here and there.

What can you do  about this type <br/>\nof thing while still allowing your teen the control they want,  b<br/>\nLooking for ideas. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n******I have a child who *can* be volatile, and yes some people could think  <br/>\nit&#39;s from screen time (or whatever they feel like blaming at the moment ) but <br/>\nI  think it&#39;s his makeup, his personality and probably hormones too. He&#39;s of <br/>\nthe  *perfectionist* type .<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen he gets frustrated or angry or annoyed, he *can* be loud and sometimes  <br/>\ndisrespectful. And the other child is almost always calm and sweet even in  <br/>\nanger. So there&#39;s that very obvious comparison that people do make, which  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t help. <br/>\n <br/>\nI try to help him through it. We talk about different ways to  channel his <br/>\nanger and frustration. And look for times that might make him easily  <br/>\nfrustrated, like making sure his body has nutrition.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut in the heat of the moment , one is not always rational , and I look at  <br/>\nit as *you feel what you feel*  and some kids are more volatile than  others, <br/>\nyet they still need to express themselves. They need to let their  feelings out <br/>\nand not keep them bottled up inside. And of all places their home  needs to <br/>\none of safety and a place where they can be heard, whether it&#39;s good or  bad.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe had an incident the other day. he was playing video games and on the  <br/>\ncomputer and taking his time getting ready for baseball ( which he LOVES!) and  <br/>\nhis father was getting very impatient and annoyed. <br/>\n <br/>\nHe was definitely going to be late and then the coach would flip out  and my <br/>\nson would feel awful ,etc.<br/>\n So there were words and loudness and stomping off and then a  quivering, yet <br/>\nangry face that stormed off to the car. <br/>\n <br/>\nIn the meantime I reiterated my belief on the home being a safe haven and a  <br/>\nplace to be able to verbalize anything , to the rest of the family who was  <br/>\nthere. And answered the question of &quot;How is he going to be on time when he&#39;s out <br/>\n in the world and has a job? &quot; with &quot;he&#39;s 11 1/2 ! If he lives in a loving,  <br/>\nrespectful and safe home making his own choices he WILL be a  responsible <br/>\nperson, etc.<br/>\n <br/>\nI asked  him to come back into the house for a  minute. You could tell he <br/>\nwanted to come but didn&#39;t.  He came up the walk  very slowly.  I gave him a hug <br/>\nand told him to have a good practice. He  hugged tight and went off.<br/>\n <br/>\nLater that night he came to me and said he was sorry he flipped out in the  <br/>\nafternoon. We talked a long time about feelings and how we can help ourselves  <br/>\ndeal with things.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think a child needs to know they are loved no matter  <br/>\nwhat...unconditionally. People can say but my child knows I love him. But does  he really?????  How <br/>\ndo you know that??? You have to *show* him<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n~marcia<br/>\nHarmonyWoodsFarm <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.xanga.com/livefreeinharmony_\">http://www.xanga.com/livefreeinharmony_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.xanga.com/livefreeinharmony)\">http://www.xanga.com/livefreeinharmony)</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************Planning your summer road trip?

Yes, I know hormones are involved--I have tried very calmly discussing my childhood and how my father was very angry and how it affected all those around him, and how really, he just needed some tools to help him reroute his anger when his brain went on overload.  I have said that i think sometimes we have to help our brains channel things....like count to 2, snap 2x, think of a strange word....anything that breaks the volcanic eruption and allows the steam to escape without killing everything down-mountain.  I support him and have said that I will go with him to talk to someone, or not.  That I really was very angry when I was his age too, as that was what I was taught thru my father&#39;s modeling of his behavior, and that it took many years...a decade+ to figure out new ways to deal with things.

Her<br/>\nfather is extremely controlling, not in the traditional parenting type<br/>\nway, but the abusive and manipulative type way.  I asked her why she<br/>\ndidn&#39;t just do something that she wanted to do and she said she didn&#39;t<br/>\nhave a choice.  I told her that she did have a choice to do whatever she<br/>\nwanted to and that she would have to deal with her dad if she made other<br/>\nchoices than what he told her she had to do.  I told her that one day,<br/>\nwether it be tomorrow, or next year or the year after, she will have to<br/>\ndefy her father to do what she wants.  He&#39;s made it an inevitable thing<br/>\nand his reasoning for being so controling is to keep her from doing all<br/>\nthose things and to make her respect him.  What he is ensuring is that<br/>\nshe will have to go against him to get what she wants in life.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink that she&#39;d ever thought of it that way, that her father has set<br/>\nher up to defy him, but that she has the choice to do so or not sooner<br/>\nor later.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no way around it.  I think that is really sad.  The only way<br/>\nshe can win is if her dad loses, but is that really winning?  They both<br/>\nlose, she will lose her dad as a parent, not because he won&#39;t be there,<br/>\nbut if she defies him, it will drive a bigger wedge between them than<br/>\nthere already is.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is really hard to sit back and watch that all play out.  I know<br/>\nChamille feels that pain too.  Our house used to be a safe place for<br/>\nthose kids, but the dad won&#39;t let them be here anymore.  It&#39;s an<br/>\ninteresting guiding compass of how to NOT be.  It provides a lot of<br/>\nconversations about how and why people behave the way they do and better<br/>\nways they could behave.  I ran across a letter that Chamille had written<br/>\nto the dad about 6 months ago.  She didn&#39;t send it because I asked her<br/>\nnot to.  I wish now that she would&#39;ve sent it.  It was very to the point<br/>\nand she was so succinct in how she wrote about his controlling behavior<br/>\nand how it affected her and his daughter.

One was at 4:30 and one was ten  <br/>\nminutes ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first, I was at Boston Market (a food place) with Holly (16) and  <br/>\nBrett, her boyfriend.  Holly&#39;s shy about ordering.  She fears menus  <br/>\nand choices sometimes.  I was going to order for her (it&#39;s a walk-up  <br/>\ncounter like a cafeteria, like Subway).  Brett apologized to me for  <br/>\nmaking the problem worse by ordering for Holly all the time.  It was  <br/>\nsweet, though, and I said it was okay.  Holly said to Brett and me  <br/>\nboth (and I wrote it down on my debit-card envelope):<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s a very complicated issue.  Why do you always have to simplify  <br/>\nthings?&quot;<br/>\nIt was a self-deprecating joke, and a good one.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty (19) was in here a minute ago.  I told him I don&#39;t feel good  <br/>\nand I&#39;m about to go to bed.  He said he&#39;s about to walk up to the  <br/>\npark to play basketball.  It&#39;s not the nearest park to us btw, or the  <br/>\nsecond nearest.  It&#39;s half a mile or more.  Two cars are sitting in  <br/>\nthe driveway, but he chooses to walk.   I asked if he would do me a  <br/>\nbig favor before he left.  I told him where there was a box of  <br/>\nkleenex three rooms away, and asked him if he would please bring it  <br/>\nto  me.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe looked at me and said in a kind of indignant tone that confused me  <br/>\nat first.  I thought he wasn&#39;t going to do it.  He said &quot;Mom, that is  <br/>\nnot a big favor.  That is MINISCULE.&quot; and he went and got the kleenex.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith used to worry, years ago, that I was letting them &quot;talk back,&quot;  <br/>\nand argue with me.  I told  him if they could win arguments with me  <br/>\nthey could win arguments with anyone, so it was good practice for  <br/>\nboth of us.  He quit worrying about it a long time ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday&#39;s examples show what can happen if conversations are  <br/>\nstraightforward and kind and honest.  It takes a few years to get to  <br/>\nthat good point, but it&#39;s possible that teens who have very few  <br/>\nrestrictions of any kind past expectations that they&#39;ll let us know  <br/>\nwhere they are and who they&#39;re with will want to be home, happily  <br/>\ntelling us what they did when they were gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday I had breakfast with a friend who also has three kids.

I said that so far I was LOVING Alexx&#39;s teen years...She laughed and said, what Alexx has been a teen for three weeks. AHHH. I stuck up for Alexx and our relationship, I even told her that when I dropped Alexx off with friends, Alexx kissed me goodbye, and she thought that was amazing, while I thought it was just a normal part of our relationship. It&#39;s so sad, how my mom thinks that it&#39;s going to get &quot;bad&quot; with Alexx. Sad.----<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I think is sad is that parents take no responsibility for how teens act. That if their children have any problems, that the problems might be them or how they treat them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read a book called &quot;Reviving Ophelia&quot; when my dd was little. What I got out of it was that, wow, you *could* have a good relationship with your child if you didnt treat them like second class citizens. I made the mistake of trying to talk to my mom about it. Of course, I was one of those bad teens. She says now, what could she do? Her stance is that I was just a hellcat and all she could do was try to corral me the best she could. Tough Love she called it. My mom thinks that it was just her between me and the abyss of total destruction.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe doesnt think that she had anything to do with driving me to the abyss. She doesnt think she had anything to do with me wanting to destruct. Life, for me, was really painful and awful, and yes, I was a &quot;bad teen&quot;. I dont want to sit here and blame my parents for my actions. But I really didnt know there were other choices. I didnt know there were other ways to live. I guess I was locked into my  vision of how teens were supposed to act, too. And my parents had their ideas of how parents act and how teens act, and we all did what we thought we had to do, I guess. That is really sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is good is that I know there is another way. And so do you. Maybe your mom will allow herself to see it, maybe not.<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://happychildhood.homeschooljournal.net\">http://happychildhood.homeschooljournal.net</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39929,"nextTopicId":39993}}
