Sometimes this is enough to diffuse any bad feelings <br/>\n&gt;on my part or his, and we can continue on with the day. Sometimes we talk <br/>\n&gt;about what might really be bothering him.

I&#39;ve been busy with illness and broken<br/>\n&gt;   computers and holiday etc. Glad to be back. My son is 5 today, hurray.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;m writing to get a little feedback. My 7 year old treats us family <br/>\n&gt; members<br/>\n&gt;   like doo doo. She talks back, pretends to kick us, slams doors, yells,<br/>\n&gt;   resists help many times each day... She is great out and about, makes<br/>\n&gt;   friends easily. As for her home behavior, I&#39;ve had enough of letting her<br/>\n&gt;   express her feelings. She actually loves to joke too, the silly stuff, <br/>\n&gt; which<br/>\n&gt;   I find sooooo iritating when I&#39;m in need of a simple ok, lets do it, like<br/>\n&gt;   brush teeth. To me, she is stuck in a mode and needs some alternatives. <br/>\n&gt; I am<br/>\n&gt;   now finding myself threatning her with if you treat me and your brother<br/>\n&gt;   poorly, no afternoon friends, (just a fancy go to your room, I can&#39;t take<br/>\n&gt;   it). She would love to play with friends all day everyday. I find she <br/>\n&gt; treats<br/>\n&gt;   us worse the more she is away by herself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Here is a simple example of her mode. Both kids have new cool electronic<br/>\n&gt;   toys. Brother asks to play with her toy. NO she barks. I help pull him off<br/>\n&gt;   her, respecting her no. Later he asks again. No she barks. Same scene. It<br/>\n&gt;   happens again. Then she asks brother for a turn with his cool toy. Sure <br/>\n&gt; Ash.<br/>\n&gt;   After she takes her very long turn, Riley asks for a turn with her toy. No<br/>\n&gt;   she barks. I did insist she give him a turn this time.<br/>\n&gt;   I do&#39;t get it. Then later, she let&#39;s all the neighborhood kids take as <br/>\n&gt; many<br/>\n&gt;   and as long of turns as they want.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Seems she has been festering this type of behavior since she was about 5.<br/>\n&gt;   Did I mention we have a 2 year old too. Hubby and I wonder if this isn&#39;t a<br/>\n&gt;   case of I want to be an only child. Or give me more attention. Seems <br/>\n&gt; that we<br/>\n&gt;   do spend a ton of our time in Ashley&#39;s world. I&#39;m looking for <br/>\n&gt; suggestions on<br/>\n&gt;   how to help her see what she is doing hurts our feeling. Also ways to <br/>\n&gt; guide<br/>\n&gt;   her towards better choices, yet I know she has to be the one to want to be<br/>\n&gt;   kind.

My Casey *needs* to get <br/>\nenough people time or she gets whiny and disagreeable. Like someone else <br/>\ncommented, it&#39;s how she recharges her battery.

It shows that she knows <br/>\nher family will always love her, even if she acts as cranky as she feels. <br/>\nIt&#39;s safe. That&#39;s a good thing in its&#39; own way. With friends and neighbors, <br/>\nshe might not be so sure they won&#39;t turn on her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Seems she has been festering this type of behavior since she was about 5. <br/>\n&gt;&gt;Did I mention we have a 2 year old too.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I remember reading that when an only child is really young when the second <br/>\nis born, they don&#39;t get a chance to express their true feelings about it. <br/>\nThey&#39;re too little to tell you how they feel. Then when number three comes <br/>\nalong they act out all the bad feelings they may have had as a toddler about <br/>\ngetting a new sibling and going from being an only to an older sister. Does <br/>\nthat make sense?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Hubby and I wonder if this isn&#39;t a case of I want to be an only child. Or <br/>\n&gt;&gt;give me more attention.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Could be. She might just need &quot;more&quot; of everything. I know my Casey does. I <br/>\ntry to love her up as much as I can and give her what I think she&#39;s needing. <br/>\nUsually it&#39;s more attention or something new to stimulate her mind. Lots of <br/>\ntimes it&#39;s NOT hugs or kisses or tickles. She has a big personal space, even <br/>\nwith me sometimes. She wants me to allow her in, but not to force my <br/>\naffection on her. Respecting that need helps a lot too. People have a hard <br/>\ntime understanding that she doesn&#39;t want a hug when she falls down. But she <br/>\ndoes want attention.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Seems that we do spend a ton of our time in Ashley&#39;s world.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s great to give her as much of yourself as you can without <br/>\nignoring everyone else&#39;s needs, including your own. It can be a balancing <br/>\nact, but well worth it. I think 7 is a tough year. Casey didn&#39;t get &quot;mean&quot; <br/>\nbut she became almost phobic about her attachment to me. I think a lot of <br/>\ndevelopment goes on at 7 and it comes out in different ways for different <br/>\nkids.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet us know how you&#39;re doing with it all.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":818735,"authorName":"Joylyn","from":"Joylyn &lt;joylyn@...&gt;","profile":"joylynrsf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Respecting people","postDate":"1010785907","msgId":2481,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDM0Y1RTcyLkJBOUEyQTc3QGd0ZS5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDk0LjFmYTczODY0LjI5NzA5NzhhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":2480,"nextInTopic":2482,"prevInTime":2480,"nextInTime":2482,"topicId":2471,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"hmm, that s interesting.

I spend about 20 mins every<br/>\nevening doing yoga with each of my kids separately. <br/>\nThen I read to them or play a game with them, still<br/>\nseparate.  It has given them each time to have mommy&#39;s<br/>\nfull attention for about an hour and their attitudes<br/>\nhave really become more positive.<br/>\nMaybe you can find something both you and your<br/>\ndaughter enjoy doing, and schedule time to do those<br/>\nthings alone together.  Also, sometimes older siblings<br/>\ndo not want to share toys because the younger ones<br/>\nhave broken or damaged things in the past.  She may<br/>\nhave a very reasonable explanation for some of her<br/>\nbehavior and may see you stepping in as &#39;taking<br/>\nsides&#39;.<br/>\nAbove all, show her she is loved, even if she is<br/>\nfeeling unlovable.

My daughter resists help<br/>\npretty much all the time, unless it&#39;s something she&#39;s specifically asked<br/>\nfor help with, and even then she wants only the help she&#39;s asked for and<br/>\nno more. If I don&#39;t respect her boundaries here, she does get cranky with<br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like your daughter maybe needs more social interaction than you<br/>\nand your son, too - is she an extravert in a family of introverts? I know<br/>\na family like this, and when the daughter&#39;s needs for social interaction<br/>\naren&#39;t met, she can get pretty nasty to her family... and it took a while<br/>\nfor them to see it, because the mom and son cane quite happily stay home<br/>\nand putter 5 days out of 6, but a day without friends is torture for the<br/>\nsister. It&#39;s been hard for them to come to a balance, but the girl really<br/>\nneeds to recharge her batteries by being with people.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, with the not sharing with her brother stuff - I wonder if some of<br/>\nthis is behavior she&#39;s picked up from other kids. I&#39;ve noticed that the<br/>\nhomeschooled kids we know, almost without exception, are generally<br/>\nprotective of siblings, but the schooled kids we know are generally at<br/>\nodds with them. Not all the time, of course, but enough that I notice it.<br/>\nI also wonder if this is a pattern that you&#39;ve all fallen into and your<br/>\nson is equally aware of it and working it - it&#39;s easy sometimes to blame<br/>\nthe kid who looks &quot;mean&quot;, but perhaps your son also has found a role he&#39;s<br/>\ncomfortable with, and he knows that you&#39;ll eventually step in and make<br/>\nhis sister give him what he wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some random thought,<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!

Then later, she let&#39;s all the neighborhood kids take as many <br/>\nand as long of turns as they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeems she has been festering this type of behavior since she was about 5. <br/>\nDid I mention we have a 2 year old too. Hubby and I wonder if this isn&#39;t a <br/>\ncase of I want to be an only child. Or give me more attention. Seems that we <br/>\ndo spend a ton of our time in Ashley&#39;s world. I&#39;m looking for suggestions on <br/>\nhow to help her see what she is doing hurts our feeling. Also ways to guide <br/>\nher towards better choices, yet I know she has to be the one to want to be <br/>\nkind. Talk to you all soon,<br/>\n<br/>\nMary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nChat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.msn.com\">http://messenger.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2598,"nextTopicId":2662}}
