Your responses have been very helpful and made me think pretty hard.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first reaction really is to put my arm around my daughter and comfort her when something like this happens.  In fact she woke me up to tell me what had happened and how angry her father was and the first thing I did was to sit next to her and hug and kiss her.  I did tell her &quot;better a broken vacuum than a broken heart.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThen I got confused about what I&#39;m &quot;supposed&quot; to do in order to help her be responsible.  She asked me &quot;am I going to have to pay for this?&quot; I&#39;ve never made her pay for things before so it was a weird question to begin with but for some reason it made me think I should be more &quot;parental&quot; and set up a payment plan.  Plus my husband was so angry.  I guess I thought I was supposed to be angry too-  Or like I was supposed to help her learn from her mistake rather than relying on my instinctive knowledge that when she messes up she is only too acutely aware of it and doesn&#39;t need me to insure her understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps me to hear you all saying things that take me back to the inclination to just be respectful and loving and trusting and work things out from there.  I am very aware of how hard it is to make human mistakes and how bad it feels.  I do it all the time.  I did it today.  But I know that this is one day and tomorrow is another day and things will be different then.  Hopefully we will grow from this and move on to other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI talked with her about your responses and my thoughts.  She talked with me about her thoughts.  She and I had a pretty good day sitting by the fire.  We watched her TV shows and she played her computer game while I pondered your thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m crying now because of how much it means to me that you all would take the time to answer me and help me with this.  Sometimes I feel very alone (but that is another story for another day).

I bought it because my son has allergies, and I was hoping it would help with our home environment.  I have to say, initially, I was really upset.  But, I fixed it.

Last year when he was 10, he clogged the toilet in his part of the house (he has a hallway with 3 rooms and a bath) and flooded the entire area. We had to call carpet cleaners to fix the damage to his play room and his bedroom. This cost about $600. Not once did I even think to have Xander help pay for the damage. After all, it was an accident. Xander felt horrible (so horrible that he was sad for days). I didn&#39;t have to scold him for him to feel responsible for his actions. He knew right away that he had messed up and saw the consequences first hand. I realized it was an accident and that he IS trying his best. He didn&#39;t overflow the toilet on purpose. Your Brenda didn&#39;t leave the vacuum outside on purpose. It was an accident. Accidents happen to all of us. She&#39;s in the process of learning about life. She&#39;s growing every minute and she will grow from this experience.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe mere fact that your daughter feels very strong remorse should be enough. She gets it. She feels very bad and realizes her mistake. I think that is enough &quot;punishment&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing to remember when unschooling is that anger really doesn&#39;t play a big role in the scheme of things. When I feel anger about something in relation to Xander, I check myself right away. I can&#39;t give him the proper love and support when I&#39;m angry or if I get angry easily. Over the years, I have released myself from anger. When Xander was little, I would get so worked up over small things or even big things. This didn&#39;t help the situations. When I stay calm and have a positive attitude even in light of dark situations, things go more smoothly. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Patti&quot; &lt;patti.dengler@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My husband, myself and my 12 year old daughter are currently deschooling.

My husband found it this morning.  It cost $500.  We are hoping that it will work when it dries.  She feels bad about it.  I&#39;m unclear how to address it.

I just want to do the best thing for her that will be healthy.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Background on this:  I had a house cleaner one time only.  I paid $90. My daughter told me she could be the house cleaner and earn money.  I&#39;ve never seen her more motivated.  I told her she could have $45 a week to do what the housecleaner did.  We made a plan.  She&#39;s been doing a very good job and has had more &quot;sparkle&quot; than I have seen in awhile.  She&#39;s making decisions about how to spend her earnings and what to save.  She negotiates what she will purchase and what she thinks is my responsibility.  It&#39;s very encouraging to see her so excited.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wasn&#39;t going to bring the housecleaner back because we can&#39;t afford it but I decided I could find the money if it was part of unschooling/deschooling.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think Brenda should help pay for the vacuum.  But I don&#39;t want to ruin the sparkle since it&#39;s been a rare thing for the last few months as is a hard won victory.  She&#39;s saving for a computer.  I thought about making her pay 10 dollars a week since she&#39;s working and earning $45.  Is that too little, too much?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sometimes my husband says I let her off too easy.  He thinks she should not be a irresponsible as she is.  I&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;s kind of normal for her age and I&#39;m not sure riding her about stuff and punishing her is going to help.  But I do hope she is going to grow to be a healthy, happy person and a valued community member and feel it&#39;s my responsibility to help with that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As a community member myself I know I need to pay my debts, offer help to others, ask for help when I need it etc...  I also insure myself heavily because I screw up and make mistakes too.  Insurance has replaced two laptops for me.  So maybe I&#39;m not a good role model?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Or maybe my husband needs to loosen up?  Instead of having a homeshooling room in our house as some might, we have a special lair for my husband so he can go and be in a spot that is clean and neat and unfettered with things of children and hobbies and dogs.  I did that for him after Brenda started crawling and things started to get cluttered.  He doesn&#39;t do well with clutter.  He doesn&#39;t break things.  When he reads books he won&#39;t crack the spine.  They still look new when he&#39;s done.  His room is pristine.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I treat books as consumables and take them everywhere.  They are damp from the bath and the pages bent from being slept on.  But they still line up ok in the bookshelf.  He says my daughter and I are hoarders though I&#39;m pretty sure you would laugh at that if you saw our house.  It&#39;s pretty freaking neat.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My husband thinks we should just fire my daughter from housecleaning and he wants to sell the computer she uses to pay for the vacuum.  That just feels drastic to me.  I think it&#39;s angry talk and he needs to calm down.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m really lost.  I want to help my daughter be responsible but I don&#39;t want her to shoulder more than a 12 year old should.  I told my husband to just lay low for a few days until his temper cools and I told my daughter who is freaking and saying she&#39;s sorry but she can&#39;t pay for it because she&#39;s too young and she needs her money that I need time to figure out what my stand is going to be.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m feeling like a pretty crappy parent these last six or so months so it&#39;s pretty hard for me to post this.

One thing she&#39;ll learn is to be less careless (but<br/>\nkids really don&#39;t have the same ability to foresee consequences and she<br/>\ncan&#39;t make her brain develop that until it does).<br/>\n<br/>\nBY FAR the most important thing she can learn from her own mistakes is how<br/>\nto behave when things go wrong - how to be forgiving when someone screws up<br/>\nand, especially, how to be solution oriented! This is HUGE.

We&#39;ve been actively in process with this since the Good Vibrations conference a couple months ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night my 12 year old left the vacuum outside in the rain.  My husband found it this morning.  It cost $500.  We are hoping that it will work when it dries.  She feels bad about it.  I&#39;m unclear how to address it.  We don&#39;t really have the money to replace it.  I&#39;m not angry though my husband is.  I just want to do the best thing for her that will be healthy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBackground on this:  I had a house cleaner one time only.  I paid $90. My daughter told me she could be the house cleaner and earn money.  I&#39;ve never seen her more motivated.  I told her she could have $45 a week to do what the housecleaner did.  We made a plan.  She&#39;s been doing a very good job and has had more &quot;sparkle&quot; than I have seen in awhile.  She&#39;s making decisions about how to spend her earnings and what to save.  She negotiates what she will purchase and what she thinks is my responsibility.  It&#39;s very encouraging to see her so excited.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t going to bring the housecleaner back because we can&#39;t afford it but I decided I could find the money if it was part of unschooling/deschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Brenda should help pay for the vacuum.  But I don&#39;t want to ruin the sparkle since it&#39;s been a rare thing for the last few months as is a hard won victory.  She&#39;s saving for a computer.  I thought about making her pay 10 dollars a week since she&#39;s working and earning $45.  Is that too little, too much?<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes my husband says I let her off too easy.  He thinks she should not be a irresponsible as she is.  I&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;s kind of normal for her age and I&#39;m not sure riding her about stuff and punishing her is going to help.  But I do hope she is going to grow to be a healthy, happy person and a valued community member and feel it&#39;s my responsibility to help with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a community member myself I know I need to pay my debts, offer help to others, ask for help when I need it etc...  I also insure myself heavily because I screw up and make mistakes too.  Insurance has replaced two laptops for me.  So maybe I&#39;m not a good role model?  <br/>\n<br/>\nOr maybe my husband needs to loosen up?  Instead of having a homeshooling room in our house as some might, we have a special lair for my husband so he can go and be in a spot that is clean and neat and unfettered with things of children and hobbies and dogs.  I did that for him after Brenda started crawling and things started to get cluttered.  He doesn&#39;t do well with clutter.  He doesn&#39;t break things.  When he reads books he won&#39;t crack the spine.  They still look new when he&#39;s done.  His room is pristine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI treat books as consumables and take them everywhere.  They are damp from the bath and the pages bent from being slept on.  But they still line up ok in the bookshelf.  He says my daughter and I are hoarders though I&#39;m pretty sure you would laugh at that if you saw our house.  It&#39;s pretty freaking neat.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband thinks we should just fire my daughter from housecleaning and he wants to sell the computer she uses to pay for the vacuum.  That just feels drastic to me.  I think it&#39;s angry talk and he needs to calm down.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really lost.  I want to help my daughter be responsible but I don&#39;t want her to shoulder more than a 12 year old should.  I told my husband to just lay low for a few days until his temper cools and I told my daughter who is freaking and saying she&#39;s sorry but she can&#39;t pay for it because she&#39;s too young and she needs her money that I need time to figure out what my stand is going to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m feeling like a pretty crappy parent these last six or so months so it&#39;s pretty hard for me to post this.  But my daughter is more important than my ego and I know I&#39;m really missing something in my thinking right now.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63774,"nextTopicId":63817}}
