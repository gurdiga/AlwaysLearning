That&#39;s why writing clearly and really thinking about it first helps lots, and assuming good intent.  This is a very different and special kind of list, largely because of the way the moderators keep it.  Something that I learned a long time ago, was that when I felt defensive, that was a big clue that there was area that I needed to work on within my self and my thoughts.  I would walk away and not respond and just think about stuff.  Meanwhile the list would go on peacefully without my defensiveness adding negativity to other people&#39;s thoughts and writings! <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":402609764,"authorName":"Anamaria","from":"Anamaria &lt;bittersweetanamaria@...&gt;","profile":"bittersweetanamaria","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"An apology from AnaMaria","postDate":"1268291009","msgId":51891,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4ODAuNDA1NTAucW1Ad2ViMTExODEwLm1haWwuZ3ExLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":51923,"prevInTime":51890,"nextInTime":51892,"topicId":51891,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My words were misunderstood...when I commented on some posts a while back.....I take responsibility for my careless communication....I think this list is great","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-207999766\">My words were misunderstood...when I commented on some posts a while back.....I take responsibility for my careless communication....I think this list is great sorry for trying to change it and offending Sandra in the process. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am going forward and learning from my mistakes.
