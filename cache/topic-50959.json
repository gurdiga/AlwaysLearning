I remember that post because I was very aware at that time (still am) of the problems of sibling rivalry and asking too much of my older daughter ( I have 2 girls).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds to me like your kids need more of your presence, energy and ideas in their daily activities.  Very often my loving attention and participation in an activity will diffuse conflict before the kids come to blows. If for example they both want the same toy, I can ask the child who has the toy if her sister can have a turn when she&#39;s finished with it. 9 times out of 10 the toy is willingly handed over within a very reasonable period of time. If the toy is a particular favourite, I try to find another toy or activity for the other child. I do not expect my older daughter to simply acquiesce to her sister&#39;s demands. No way. That would be totally unfair and a sure-fire way to breed resentment.<br/>\nClaire<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, John and Amanda Slater &lt;fourslaterz@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ________________________________<br/>\n&gt; From: Su Penn &lt;su@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know if it applies to your kids, really, but I found the book The Explosive Child very helpful--possibly the most useful tool I found--for creating a more harmonious home with Eric.

About a year ago, my two oldest--7 and 4 at the time--were getting caught up in a lot of conflicts over small things. One day in the car, I asked them, &quot;Do you want to fight?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey both said no, that they like it better when they didn&#39;t fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nI said that I also preferred it if we didn&#39;t fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometime not long after that, they were starting to get into a fight, and I was having that &quot;oh, here we go again&quot; reaction that makes it so hard to respond lovingly and gracefully. But I remembered that conversation in the car, and I said loudly, &quot;Raise your hand if you don&#39;t want to fight!&quot; and put my hand up. Eric, who is older, put his hand up right away. Carl did, too, after I repeated it a couple of times.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there we all were, with our hands in the air, agreeing that we didn&#39;t want to to fight. That is a powerful starting point for problem-solving! Getting our hands in the air also broke the momentum of the two of them yelling or kicking at each other or whatever they were doing, and we were able to talk.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe continued to use this for some months; we haven&#39;t done it in awhile, I guess that rough patch passed. I had forgotten about it until I heard your question.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also talked to the boys, _not_ in the heat of the moment, about how very much I do not want to be reduced, as a parent, to making the decisions for them and being bossy (like you telling Mia to get out of the hammock). They also really like it when I don&#39;t tell them what to do, so sometimes I can say, &quot;Guys! Listen! Right now I&#39;m feeling so frustrated that the only thing I can think of to do is say, You go to this room and You go to that room if you can&#39;t get along! But I don&#39;t want to do that! What can we do instead?&quot; They are very glad to help me not be bossy, because nobody&#39;s happy when the Mama gets bossy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    Jude certainly has a short fuse and is the first to explode, however, Mia&#39;s fuse is starting to shorten in frustration to all the conflict they are experiencing.  I have explained to Mia that it is of Great help to me if she could &#39;give in&#39; to Jude&#39;s demands; show him kindness and (hopefully) in return, he will reciprocate.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is tricky. I keep a close eye on it for Carl, because although he is younger than Eric, it is easier for him to switch gears, easier to accept an alternative. A lot of conflicts end up resolved by Carl saying, &quot;OK, Eric, you can go first,&quot; or something similar. I don&#39;t want Carl to feel like it&#39;s his job to placate Eric (who can be explosive) or to help me avoid the explosions; at the same time, Carl&#39;s flexibility is a gift and a tool for avoiding explosions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thank Carl for his flexibility, but I also check in with him: &quot;Is this what you really want to do?&quot; I don&#39;t want him to give away so much that he feels deprived or unheard. My partner and I talk to both boys about the importance of expressing their wishes fully (we call this saying &quot;what is your 100%&quot;--if you could have 100% of what you want, what would it be?) I talked about the 100% on a website once in answer to a question about relationships; it&#39;s a tool we use all the time even among us grownups. Here is the link: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ask.metafilter.com/137148/What-clever-relationship-hacks-have-you-come-up-with#1960336\">http://ask.metafilter.com/137148/What-clever-relationship-hacks-have-you-come-up-with#1960336</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf you made a decision on Mia&#39;s behalf that it is her job to be more flexible, no wonder she&#39;s feeling burdened by that! That&#39;s a lot to expect of a child. A friend of mine was just talking to me about how hard it was for her growing up to have her parents always putting the burden on her, as the oldest, to take responsibility for being a role model, and even to be responsible for her younger sisters&#39; behavior (&quot;you knew she&#39;d do X if you did that...&quot;). It sounds like you&#39;re putting Mia in that position.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like maybe you could benefit from some pro-active problem-solving with the kids when you&#39;re not in the middle of things. Making a plan in advance for how you&#39;ll handle things when they come up is _huge_. Especially if the kids know that they can also remind you of the agreement if you start to violate it (my kids sometimes will say to me, &quot;Mom, I think you need to turn your patience knob up!&quot;).
