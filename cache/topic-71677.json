His older brother came up with a game they played each time he took the medicine. And then we gave him a quarter. We completely bribed him to take it. I would say he was not given a choice. How would you advise a family in this situation. I do not force my kids to take medicine unless I feel it is necessary for them to recover.

It helped him so much that I could relax and smile at him and laugh with him and recite the poems that calm him and comfort him. &nbsp;I could not have done that for him if I hadn&#39;t let the fear go.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><br></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\">In the ambulance he had refused to have a mask on so at the hospital they gave us a syringe of medicine to give him. &nbsp;That&#39;s where I lost my balance and my calm and made the wrong decisions. &nbsp;X&#39;s granny, his other mummy and I tried to give X the medicine. &nbsp;He refused. &nbsp;Repeatedly. &nbsp;I could see he was overwhelmed, scared and feeling like decisions were being made for him (which they were) and he quite rightly dug his heels in. &nbsp;X&#39;s other mummy and I have had many conversations about X&#39;s right to make his own decisions about what happens to his body, though usually those conversations have been about teeth brushing not giving medication.</p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><br></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\">The more we told him he had to take the medicine, the more we told him he did not have a choice, the more he fought for his right to make that decision for himself. &nbsp;I advocated for him to have time to adjust and understand what was happening but not strongly enough. &nbsp;I should have been advocating for his right to refuse the medicine all together. &nbsp;We didn&#39;t give him the time and help he needed to make a decision of his own. &nbsp;We backed him into a corner where he could only react by rejecting the fear and coercion that were being put onto him. &nbsp;Trying to force him to take medicine against his will felt wrong to all of us, and it was wrong. &nbsp;We let fear and stress play a part in our decision and we made the wrong decision because of it. &nbsp;His condition was serious but not life threatening. &nbsp;The steroids would have helped if he had managed to take them, if we had not tried to force him which only resulted in him being sick and not getting any benefit from them anyway. &nbsp;In the end we all came to our senses and calmed down. We collectively stepped back and took a deep breath and found a bit of perspective. &nbsp;I could wish we had done that at the start of that pointless battle of wills instead of at the end. &nbsp;Once we were calm we stopped making the situation worse and realised that helping him to be calm and feel safe was more important and would help him more and faster than getting medicine into him. &nbsp;</p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><br></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\">Once he was calm and being treated with respect he cooperated with everything else the doctors needed from him. &nbsp;He just really needed us to recognise his right to say no to treatment and his right to have an explanation of what was happening to him and why. &nbsp;</p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><br></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\">I have learned so much from what I got wrong. &nbsp;Our ideals were put to the test and although we fell down we have been given a powerful insight into why those ideals are important and how they would have helped if we had been true to them. &nbsp;</p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><br></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><br></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\">Allergies are scary. &nbsp;But lots of things in life are scary. &nbsp;Fear does not make my family safer and it takes away from my ability to see clearly and make good choices. &nbsp;Once we got past the first fear driven mistakes our stay at the hospital was not unhappy or unpleasant at all. &nbsp;It was full of love and humour, playing and connecting with each other. &nbsp;</p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><br></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\">It was a joyful night.</p> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-805244121ygroups-quoted\"><br><br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In alwayslearning@yahoogroups.com, &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt; wrote:<br><br><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-805244121ygrps-yiv-2085479463\">&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt; wrote:<br>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Something you might find helpful is to seek out stories By adults on the autism spectrum describing how they view the world.<br>\n </span></blockquote>**********<br>\n<br>\nUpcoming PBS documentary which looks at autism from the perspective of autistic kids as well as adults!

So we&#39;re working on ways to help them through that feeling and helping them make choices which don&#39;t impact negatively on others around them. If I know they are feeling out of control I will do what I can to lessen the impact of others on them, and make sure they aren&#39;t put in a situation which will be too hard to manage at that time.

Emotional control is not a good description of what I mean at all.  For me it has come to mean a way of thinking that helps me avoid rule bound and knee jerk emotional decisions and repression and shame about strong emotions.  And you are right that &#39;emotional control&#39; is a poor choice of words for that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy childhood was traumatic and because of that my 20s were filled with acute mental distress.  I spent a long time struggling with emotions I could not &#39;control&#39;.  Eventually I learned that what I was trying to do was to stop my emotions and keep them in a box.  Well, that didn&#39;t work very well.  Even with a box made of very strong psychiatric medication the lid wouldn&#39;t stay on.  Eventually I realized that all of this mental pain was no different to physical pain and that pain is just a message that something is amiss and needs healing.  emotional stability only happened when I let go and allowed myself to process and understand the causes of those painful emotions.  I also needed to learn a lot of skills to maintain my emotional balance.  Those skills are all about listening to my self and not ignoring my needs and knowing how to process and respond to emotions in a healthy way. I see in my son that he instinctively &#39;hears&#39; his internal signals and I see how children have to be taught to stop listening.  Helping him learn to meet his needs and understand his emotions is about working with him to find what works for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose what I think of as emotional control is is really emotional intelligence and good mental hygiene.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I said that chocolate trashes his emotional control I meant that after he eats chocolate he becomes overwhelmed by strong emotions which he struggles to understand and cope with.  At other times I see him retreat from the depth of his emotions and I suspect he finds strong emotions frightening.  I see him dealing with that in a variety of ways and I wonder if that is part of his reason for choosing to eat chocolate (and yes, I do think the effect is hormonal). He needs to experience those strong emotions in a safe way so that he can learn to manage them and stop being afraid of them. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo it is not &#39;emotional control&#39; that he is trying to learn at all.  We model and suggest various ways of handling strong emotions, like breathing deeply, using language to name his emotions and finding a physical outlet like running fast or hitting or breaking things.  And we try to see the communicative value. None of that is about control. <br/>\n<br/>\nOur asinine attempt to restrict chocolate was a bad idea.  Our boy knew it and he was making it plain that he strongly disagreed with us.  I hope that next time he is the only person who needs to tell me that I am wrong.  <br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, egg based restrictions are not an issue at all.  He totally accepts that he needs to avoid egg and he had been trying to do so for quite a long time before we realized what was making him ill.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: managing allergies and intolerance.","postDate":"1372751097","msgId":71697,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI3REE0QUE4LTY5QkMtNDlFQS1CQkM1LTUwMDkxNTQ2MDkxMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGtxdDVzYStkNW9oQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtxdDVzYStkNW9oQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71696,"nextInTopic":71698,"prevInTime":71696,"nextInTime":71698,"topicId":71677,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I learned to communicate in ways that worked for Mo... and found that I hadn t really understood communication before.

She could tolerate a few at a time and then would shush whoever was trying to talk to her. If you went too many words past her shush point, she would start to shut down - curl up on herself like a turtle going into a shell, and go very, very still. I learned not to go past the shush point.

So it&#39;s possible he could be getting an upset stomach or a headache and not know how to express that - from his perspective, he feels bad and wrong and &quot;off&quot; and is using behavior to express that.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlan ahead a bit for when you know he&#39;s going to have chocolate - that&#39;s tricky, because on the one hand as you said, you don&#39;t want to create a self-fulfilling prophecy, but on the other you don&#39;t want to set him up for an ugly situation if you can avoid it. You could also experiment a bit with buffering the effects - if you know dark chocolate is the worst, offer other things along with it, other food and drinks and see what happens. In fact, unless he absolutely adores dark chocolate over other kinds, it should be relatively easy to avoid - easy to offer milk chocolate and the really, really cheap stuff that has hardly any chocolate in it at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut it&#39;s also possible you&#39;ve been seeing a chocolate problem when there&#39;s something else going on, especially if there&#39;s been stress over food in other areas - you&#39;re &quot;primed&quot; to see food as a culprit, and it&#39;s possible that by backing off and looking at a bigger picture you&#39;ll start to see a different set of patterns. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; If chocolate does always make him unhappy and volatile I suppose we just have to work on strategies to support him and help him through that experience.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>************<br/>\n<br/>\nAs he gets older things will change. He&#39;ll be older, for one ;) and better able to talk about what&#39;s going on. And if he doesn&#39;t feel backed into a corner, he&#39;s much, much more likely to say &quot;you know, I want to have a good time and I won&#39;t if I eat this.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nMy stepson gets intermittent pressure from his bio mom to eat/not eat certain things and ways... usually whatever is the latest food fad, and that was true during the years we were unschooling (he&#39;s 19 now). Over the years I&#39;ve gotten to see how that pressure affects his ability to make decisions, and it&#39;s really striking. When he&#39;s getting a lot of pressure, he&#39;s more likely to make decisions defiantly, or passive-aggressively. When the pressure is low, he&#39;s much more thoughtful about what he eats. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"4"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] managing allergies and intolerance.","postDate":"1372710381","msgId":71693,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg1ODMwODUyLUIyNTktNDdBNi04QzBFLTIzMjlCRUQ1QTUwOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEQ1ODEwNDg4LTJDNTQtNEVGQy05Njg0LTEwNzI1NjM0MzQwQkBsZW50aW5lZmFtaWx5LmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGtxcmllcitvaXRzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8RUIyRTBDOUEtRENBQS00RkEyLUE4M0EtMzVFQjlBRTUxNTlGQGxlbnRpbmVmYW1pbHkuY29tPiA8QURGRTZERTMtNUI1My00OUM2LTkxMDItNkJEOUVDMUQ0Q0E5QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8RDU4MTA0ODgtMkM1NC00RUZDLTk2ODQtMTA3MjU2MzQzNDBCQGxlbnRpbmVmYW1pbHkuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71692,"nextInTopic":71694,"prevInTime":71692,"nextInTime":71694,"topicId":71677,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-But isn t there such a thing as real problems?

My daughter (10) has suffered from asthma symptoms & a stuffy nose since she was 2.  I was very anxiety filled because of that and other factors in my life.  I cast about for answers and cures.  Our lives were filled with appointments and strict limits on food.  But the asthma & stuffy nose persisted, even worsened.  I&#39;m not saying that I didn&#39;t learn anything useful during that time or that we didn&#39;t benefit at all from the other things we tried but the most dramatic changes came when we started radical unschooling (we started in early September).  There were lots of changes that we made, one of them being releasing control of food, which was scary for me as I was fearful that her symptoms would worsen.  In February she told me that she was breathing out of her nose more and more.  In March she told me she is a nose breather now.  I cried silent tears of joy as I had been seeking that goal for many years.  She had been &quot;getting tight&quot; with increasing regularity to the point where she was getting tight every night, despite our use of inhaled steriods.  She hasn&#39;t been tight in about 5 months now & is medication free.  One day a few months ago I had PMS and was weak and I snapped at her a few times, being impatient and irritable.  She snored that night for the first time in awhile.  It took 3 days for it to clear up.  I have never spoken to her like that since.  I am stunned, amazed and very grateful for the wisdom I have learned and continue to learn on this list.  It is amazing the impact it has had on all of our lives.  And it has been surprising to experience how much our emotions impact our health.  Even her skin, previously dry and bumpy, has improved.  Radical unschooling has helped us be smooth and soft, inside and out.  :D  Thanks to all who write with questions and with insight.<br/>\n-Cass<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":409467702,"authorName":"Sheryl Lentine","from":"Sheryl Lentine &lt;sheryl@...&gt;","profile":"sheryl_lentine","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: managing allergies and intolerance.","postDate":"1372693915","msgId":71692,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQ1ODEwNDg4LTJDNTQtNEVGQy05Njg0LTEwNzI1NjM0MzQwQkBsZW50aW5lZmFtaWx5LmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEFERkU2REUzLTVCNTMtNDlDNi05MTAyLTZCRDlFQzFENENBOUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGtxcmllcitvaXRzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8RUIyRTBDOUEtRENBQS00RkEyLUE4M0EtMzVFQjlBRTUxNTlGQGxlbnRpbmVmYW1pbHkuY29tPiA8QURGRTZERTMtNUI1My00OUM2LTkxMDItNkJEOUVDMUQ0Q0E5QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71691,"nextInTopic":71693,"prevInTime":71691,"nextInTime":71693,"topicId":71677,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sandra, I read your reply and at first it angered me.

Of course, I don&#39;t &quot;prefer&quot; to think of him as just a child with autism.  I think of him as my sweet and wonderfully talented little boy.

It was a good call :) I do think I understand the viewpoint, but practically, how can it play out? When a child is 3, not making any efforts to communicate, and not seeming to be aware of others, you would not try to see if there is a way to help him?<br/>\n<br/>\nI also understand that there is a mad rush to &quot;diagnose&quot; every difference there is among kids and that in many cases, the diagnosis should be &quot;children weren&#39;t designed to sit in a classroom all day.&quot;  But isn&#39;t there such a thing as real problems? How are social, behavioral, or emotional problems any different than physical ones?  If a child has asthma, that is not something that people would argue with.  It&#39;s not likely that they would suggest you not medicate them and think its all in the mothers head.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just trying to understand.  I want to do what&#39;s best for my children (there are 6 of them).  Providence is the youngest.

I sell my excess eggs and several people have told me that they can eat my eggs whereas they cannot tolerate any egg from the store - be it organic, &quot;free range&quot;, etc.  Also, duck eggs, if you can find them, are easily digested by many people who can&#39;t eat chicken eggs.  They taste the same as a chicken egg and can be used in all the same ways you&#39;d use a chicken egg.

Does he have the same reactions to organic cocoa or chocolate. Look for the real stuff. If the reaction is not the same then keep some of it stashed away, maybe in your purse if on the road, for when he has the craving hit. As for the eggs, I read somewhere that the intolerance can go away. Do some research. Go organic/free range. I also have heard/read somewhere that although it&#39;s not supposed to make a difference, it may depend on brown or white shell.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] managing allergies and intolerance.","postDate":"1372532935","msgId":71678,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc1NUIxQTlELUFFRDAtNEE3RC1CQTZELTBCMzU1MjM5RTk2RUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGtxaWd2ditqbm42QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtxaWd2ditqbm42QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71677,"nextInTopic":71679,"prevInTime":71677,"nextInTime":71679,"topicId":71677,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I cannot give him any choice about eating egg, it makes him very I&#39;ll.  Chocolate is not so clear cut and given how much we are going to have to restrict his diet to avoid egg I am reluctant to put further restrictions on him.  But, chocolate makes him angry, upset and volatile and affects his digestion.  It is not fun for any of us so we are, reluctantly, excluding it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone got any advice on managing food issues?  I feel horrible for trampling on his autonomy but the effects are so negative I don&#39;t feel we have a choice.  Food is otherwise unrestricted. I want him to have a choice about chocolate at least, but I am just not confident that he can make an informed decision when he is so young.  Am I just plain wrong?  And if not what sort of age can I expect to be able to give that control back to him?  I am fine with him choosing to eat chocolate once in a while, if he understands the consequences. I just don&#39;t think we can live with the upset and distress if he chooses it regularly and I am not sure that at three he can understand the link between eating chocolate and feeling bad well enough to make an informed decision.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":72299,"nextTopicId":72279}}
