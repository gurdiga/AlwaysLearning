We structured our entire <br/>\n&gt; meeting<br/>\n&gt; this weekend around the concept of trustworthiness, honesty and <br/>\n&gt; stealing.  I<br/>\n&gt; mean, we really did it up.  And the girl responded with all the right<br/>\n&gt; answers, etc.  She *got it*.  I know because I was paying attention.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, after the meeting my co-leader and I sat down with the girl.  I <br/>\n&gt; was very<br/>\n&gt; gentle with her, reminded her about the incident and how I would know <br/>\n&gt; that a<br/>\n&gt; dollar was missing, and that it was.  She denied that she took it.  We <br/>\n&gt; talked<br/>\n&gt; some more, told her we weren&#39;t upset, etc., and after a while, she <br/>\n&gt; admitted<br/>\n&gt; she took it.  No tears, no remorse, no nothing, though.  She looked at <br/>\n&gt; me,<br/>\n&gt; right in the eye, the whole time.  We brought the grandmother in and <br/>\n&gt; the girl<br/>\n&gt; and she worked out some chores she could do around the house. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We thought we did a good job, even though my co-leader and I disagreed <br/>\n&gt; on the<br/>\n&gt; girl&#39;s reaction.  She thought the girl was fighting back tears, and I <br/>\n&gt; never<br/>\n&gt; once thought that.  In fact, I thought she was tuning us out, and only<br/>\n&gt; nodding when necessary.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Fast forward to Saturday afternoon&#39;s candy sale.  I took her straight <br/>\n&gt; away<br/>\n&gt; with me from the meeting to the sale.  All the kids were hungry, and <br/>\n&gt; she was<br/>\n&gt; the only one without money, so I bought her a meal on the way, which I <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; mind in the least.  In the Burger King she found a dime that someone had<br/>\n&gt; dropped (I saw it first).  I said, &quot;Oh, a reward for being honest!&quot; <br/>\n&gt; and said<br/>\n&gt; she could put it in her pocket.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; About an hour into the candy sale, she comes up with a quarter and the <br/>\n&gt; dime<br/>\n&gt; and asks if she can buy some of the mints we are selling.  I told her she<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t have enough, but asked her where she got the quarter.  She <br/>\n&gt; said, &quot;From<br/>\n&gt; that man.&quot;  It&#39;s not unusual for people to offer the kids money, and so I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t think much about it...but I did ask her if he gave any of the <br/>\n&gt; other<br/>\n&gt; kids money.  She said no.  The rest of the day went on without incident.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; However, when I get home with the money from the sale, the drawer was $10<br/>\n&gt; short.  Now, I KNOW that there are a hundred other explanations to why <br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; could be.  I could have given someone change for a $20 instead of a <br/>\n&gt; $10, it<br/>\n&gt; could have blown away, etc.  Our candy is $4/box, so it&#39;s probably not an<br/>\n&gt; accounting error.  Besides all our inventory is correct, etc.  But <br/>\n&gt; this is<br/>\n&gt; very suspicious.  I have no evidence that says she could have taken <br/>\n&gt; it, other<br/>\n&gt; than her bad reputation.  I did find the lid of the money box kind of <br/>\n&gt; ajar a<br/>\n&gt; couple of times, and I know at least once I had left it that way, and the<br/>\n&gt; other time I was surprised and thought I&#39;d locked it back. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Her reputation gets worse, however.  Another parent, who didn&#39;t know <br/>\n&gt; about<br/>\n&gt; the missing dollar or 10, told my co-leader that he heard the girl ask<br/>\n&gt; someone for a quarter at a candy sale 2 weekends ago.  He said he was too<br/>\n&gt; shocked to say anything at the time, and just remembered today.  We can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have our kids asking for people&#39;s money to put in their pocket.  <br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s no<br/>\n&gt; excuse for that.  But now we know how she got the quarter yesterday, <br/>\n&gt; too. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve decided that since she&#39;s been at enough sales to meet her fair <br/>\n&gt; share,<br/>\n&gt; that she&#39;s not invited back to any more.  I think I will notify the<br/>\n&gt; grandmother that if the girl turns up with a lot of money or something <br/>\n&gt; she<br/>\n&gt; bought worth $10, then we know where she probably got it.  I&#39;m not <br/>\n&gt; going to<br/>\n&gt; accuse her outright, because I have no evidence.  Luckily for us, we also<br/>\n&gt; received $20 in donations that day, so I made up the $10 out of that. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for reading this far.

What does that say about latent expectations for the child?  What <br/>\nsort of expectations should we have for the kids who have not yet been <br/>\ncaught in teh act?  Do those latent expectations (if any) influence how she <br/>\nor the other kids are treated?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat she did end up doing was ask a total stranger for money - odd maybe, <br/>\nbut there it is.  She&#39;s a telemarketer without a phone, a street musician <br/>\nwithout a guitar, a kid without a paying job.  Did she ask for the money in <br/>\nthe name of the group or for herself and does she know what &#39;accepting <br/>\ndonations under false pretences&#39; is?  Did the man give the money in the <br/>\nexpectation that it would go into the group kitty?  Was he just being kind <br/>\nto a child?<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked complete strangers for money once during a Ren Fair maybe 20 years <br/>\nago.  Made a good 8 or 10 bucks by offering to write their names for a <br/>\nquarter.  I was a most learned individual, you see.  They&#39;d pay up, I&#39;d <br/>\nwrite a big florid &quot;X&quot;, make an exclamation on how wonderous it was and <br/>\nthey&#39;d laugh and wander off.  My friend and I got dinner.  Is what we did, <br/>\ndifferent from what she did?  I suppose it rests on how she represented <br/>\nherself, and to whom exactly the man thought he was donating money (the <br/>\ntroop or the individual child.)  I don&#39;t suppose you could find and ask the <br/>\nman?<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I think maybe the child needs a way to make some money of her <br/>\nown.  Some that she can keep for herself and use for her own little <br/>\nwants... but what kind of safe jobs would be out there for an 8 year old, I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t begin to say.<br/>\nMaybe she could work a Ren Fair...<br/>\nHeidi</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":96795689,"authorName":"Tuckervill@aol.com","from":"Tuckervill@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Sticky fingers update--long","postDate":"1037634898","msgId":10750,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExZS4xOWVmNTIxNS4yYjBhNjc1MkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":10746,"nextInTopic":10767,"prevInTime":10749,"nextInTime":10751,"topicId":10740,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/18/2002 8:22:06 AM Central Standard Time, ...

We structured our entire meeting <br/>\nthis weekend around the concept of trustworthiness, honesty and stealing.  I <br/>\nmean, we really did it up.  And the girl responded with all the right <br/>\nanswers, etc.  She *got it*.  I know because I was paying attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, after the meeting my co-leader and I sat down with the girl.  I was very <br/>\ngentle with her, reminded her about the incident and how I would know that a <br/>\ndollar was missing, and that it was.  She denied that she took it.  We talked <br/>\nsome more, told her we weren&#39;t upset, etc., and after a while, she admitted <br/>\nshe took it.  No tears, no remorse, no nothing, though.  She looked at me, <br/>\nright in the eye, the whole time.  We brought the grandmother in and the girl <br/>\nand she worked out some chores she could do around the house.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe thought we did a good job, even though my co-leader and I disagreed on the <br/>\ngirl&#39;s reaction.  She thought the girl was fighting back tears, and I never <br/>\nonce thought that.  In fact, I thought she was tuning us out, and only <br/>\nnodding when necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nFast forward to Saturday afternoon&#39;s candy sale.  I took her straight away <br/>\nwith me from the meeting to the sale.  All the kids were hungry, and she was <br/>\nthe only one without money, so I bought her a meal on the way, which I didn&#39;t <br/>\nmind in the least.  In the Burger King she found a dime that someone had <br/>\ndropped (I saw it first).  I said, &quot;Oh, a reward for being honest!&quot; and said <br/>\nshe could put it in her pocket.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout an hour into the candy sale, she comes up with a quarter and the dime <br/>\nand asks if she can buy some of the mints we are selling.  I told her she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have enough, but asked her where she got the quarter.  She said, &quot;From <br/>\nthat man.&quot;  It&#39;s not unusual for people to offer the kids money, and so I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t think much about it...but I did ask her if he gave any of the other <br/>\nkids money.  She said no.  The rest of the day went on without incident.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, when I get home with the money from the sale, the drawer was $10 <br/>\nshort.  Now, I KNOW that there are a hundred other explanations to why that <br/>\ncould be.  I could have given someone change for a $20 instead of a $10, it <br/>\ncould have blown away, etc.  Our candy is $4/box, so it&#39;s probably not an <br/>\naccounting error.  Besides all our inventory is correct, etc.  But this is <br/>\nvery suspicious.  I have no evidence that says she could have taken it, other <br/>\nthan her bad reputation.  I did find the lid of the money box kind of ajar a <br/>\ncouple of times, and I know at least once I had left it that way, and the <br/>\nother time I was surprised and thought I&#39;d locked it back.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHer reputation gets worse, however.  Another parent, who didn&#39;t know about <br/>\nthe missing dollar or 10, told my co-leader that he heard the girl ask <br/>\nsomeone for a quarter at a candy sale 2 weekends ago.  He said he was too <br/>\nshocked to say anything at the time, and just remembered today.  We can&#39;t <br/>\nhave our kids asking for people&#39;s money to put in their pocket.  There&#39;s no <br/>\nexcuse for that.  But now we know how she got the quarter yesterday, too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve decided that since she&#39;s been at enough sales to meet her fair share, <br/>\nthat she&#39;s not invited back to any more.  I think I will notify the <br/>\ngrandmother that if the girl turns up with a lot of money or something she <br/>\nbought worth $10, then we know where she probably got it.  I&#39;m not going to <br/>\naccuse her outright, because I have no evidence.  Luckily for us, we also <br/>\nreceived $20 in donations that day, so I made up the $10 out of that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reading this far.
