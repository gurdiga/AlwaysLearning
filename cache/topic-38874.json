In a practical sense it has benefited me  1000 times<br/>\nover during my life and I believe it is an important skill to  develop<br/>\nand practice beyond the basics of letter and list writing. If they  don&#39;t<br/>\ngive it a go they may never discover the joy of it and if the do give  it<br/>\na shot they may well find a whole new world open up to them.  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nI love to write, myself. I have 2 blogs with seemingly-endless entries. I  <br/>\nkept a diary and journals from when I was a teen until I started blogging. I  <br/>\noften think I have an affinity with the written word-it goes from my brain to my <br/>\n fingers without effort. I didn&#39;t gain this from someone making me write. My <br/>\njoy  of writing would have been snuffed out if it was required of me-it was <br/>\nsomething  I picked up and expanded and grew with the joy and time I put into it.<br/>\n <br/>\nSometimes, Wyl (9) wants to communicate with someone. At this point,  working <br/>\non it on his own (either typing or handwriting) is slow and difficult.  If he <br/>\ndoes want to do something small, he wants help with spelling-I do so,  <br/>\ngladly. (Incidentally, Storm [3 1/2] has picked this up and will often ask how  to <br/>\nspell entire sentences while he is doodling, drawing and &quot;writing&quot;) If he  <br/>\nwants to write a letter to someone, I will offer for him to dictate to me while  I <br/>\nwrite for him. I type very fast, so I can keep up with his though process and <br/>\n it goes more quickly and thus smoother. If I made him do it himself, I&#39;m <br/>\ncertain  he would lose almost all interest in communicating by <br/>\nwritten/typewritten word.  Very occasionally, he&#39;ll come to me and ask if I can write something <br/>\nfor him  (actually, today he asked me to help him finish writing a recipe he <br/>\nhad  started and it was getting long and tiring). The more I support his <br/>\ninterest in  communication in ways that I can, in ways that make it easy and <br/>\ninteresting, the  more he will continue with it. If I make it hard and boring, why <br/>\nwould he want  to continue?<br/>\n <br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nDe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************Looking for simple solutions to your real-life financial <br/>\nchallenges?

They have never been in daycare (Marty and Kirby, once, stayed  <br/>\nat a mother&#39;s-day-out at a church near us for two hours while I went  <br/>\nChristmas shopping, and Marty mentioned every time we passed that  <br/>\nbuilding for years--never in a good way).  They have never been to  <br/>\nschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we have something scheduled, we go there.  If people are coming  <br/>\nover, we stay home.  We check on each others&#39;s needs for help, food,  <br/>\nclean clothes, rides, need to talk... this way of being has evolved  <br/>\nover the 22  years I&#39;ve been a mom.  It evolved into unschooling  <br/>\npretty smoothly, and now is evolving out into their adult lives and  <br/>\nrelationship with me and their dad seamlessly.  There was not  <br/>\ndifference between their pre-school lives and their unschooling  <br/>\nyears, and no difference between their pre-18-year-old and 18, 19,  <br/>\n21, 22 year old selves, except at some point they can&#39;t be on our  <br/>\ninsurance anymore.  Kirby, the oldest, has his own job and medical,  <br/>\ndental, automotive insurance now.  He lives in another state, because  <br/>\na job transferred him there.  Before that he was living at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey do whatever they like whenever they want to do it, but &quot;without  <br/>\nmy permission&quot; isn&#39;t an issue.  They let me know, and if there are  <br/>\nany real objections, it wouldn&#39;t have to be me to state them--it  <br/>\ncould be their dad or a sibling or a friend.

The master offered  <br/>\ntea, and he held out his cup. While the student recited his knowledge  <br/>\nand cataloged his accomplishments to date, the master poured slowly.  <br/>\nThe bragging continued, and the pouring continued, until the student  <br/>\nwas getting a lapful of tea, and said, �My cup is full!� The master  <br/>\nsmiled and said, �Yes, it is. And until you empty yourself of what  <br/>\nyou think you know, you won�t be able to learn.�<br/>\n<br/>\nWeird Al says it a different way in �Everything You Know is Wrong,�  <br/>\nand Christians say �You must surrender yourself.� Before that Jesus  <br/>\nsaid, �Unless you become as a little child��<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat it means in homeschooling terms is that as long as you think you  <br/>\ncan control and add to what you already know, it will be hard to come  <br/>\nto unschooling. The more quickly you empty your cup and open yourself  <br/>\nto new ideas uncritically, the sooner you will see natural learning  <br/>\nblossom.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo much for philosophy and buildup. How can this be done? Can it work  <br/>\nfor former teachers? What about engineers who are sure their children  <br/>\nneed lots of math in an organized fashion? What about moms who love  <br/>\nschedules and organization?<br/>\n<br/>\nDeschooling is needed much more by parents than by  <br/>\nchildren.********************<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest is here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/deschooling\">http://sandradodd.com/deschooling</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":113611854,"authorName":"Nina","from":"&quot;Nina&quot; &lt;kiorakiwi@...&gt;","profile":"kiorakiwi","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Still learning bare with me...","postDate":"1222717272","msgId":38881,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdicmIwbythMW9wQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE3RDlBMzIwMDU0RTQyNjM5RjI4RUFGN0M2MjkzQTAzQFJvYnluUEM+"},"prevInTopic":38879,"nextInTopic":38882,"prevInTime":38880,"nextInTime":38882,"topicId":38874,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... your ... not, ...
