We traveled the country one summer and had a blast.  Then we bought land and horses and now we only take little getaway&#39;s to see snow.  My spouse has talked about living on a sailboat, but the kids said only if it comes with acreage and horses.  RVing is a fun way to travel, though, we have good memories.  I recommend everyone try it at least for a few weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Lesa &lt;lesajm@...&gt;<br/>\nTo: Always Learning &lt;AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com&gt;; Crunchy Springfield &lt;Crunchy_Springfield@yahoogroups.com&gt;; RCU Yahoo Group &lt;RadChristianUnschoolers@yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, October 16, 2006 1:05:46 PM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Barenaked Family...
