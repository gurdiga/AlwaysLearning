I&#39;m new to this group and new to unschooling. I just began about two weeks ago, and I&#39;m struggling with the deschooling process, so I&#39;m just looking for some insight about what I can do to create a better unschooling environment for myself and to rid myself of all of the schooly notions. I should probably give a little bit of background information first. I&#39;m 16, and I began looking into unschooling back in October. My Mom was hesitant at first, but decided in early December that unschooling would in fact be good for me. My father, on the other hand, is very unsupportive. My parents are divorced and my mother has custody of me. We signed up to attend the UWWG and my dad at first agreed to go, but later emailed by mom saying he didn&#39;t want to because he didn&#39;t want me to get the idea that he supported me unschooling in any way.

I guess I&#39;m just looking for ideas to relieve some of the pressure and to feel more comfortable about what I&#39;m doing. Also, and I probably should have mentioned this earlier, going back to school is not a possibility. I have a lot of emotional and stress issues and school really just exacerbated the problems, to the point that I was becoming incapable of going about daily things and I became physically ill. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated! <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I had a thought this morning about the recent criticism of the advice  <br/>\n&gt; to do more.  The past week on this list has seen several mothers of  <br/>\n&gt; babies assuring us they could tell us how to help unschoolers, and  <br/>\n&gt; that our advice was lacking.    (Some of them have apologized, or come  <br/>\n&gt; near it, in side e-mail, so I&#39;m not trying to stir that up again.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I do believe that it must be nearly impossible to begin to deschool in  <br/>\n&gt; the absence of school-age concerns, so it&#39;s possible that the mother  <br/>\n&gt; of a baby who reads all the deschooling articles she can find will nod  <br/>\n&gt; and say &quot;Yep, got it; done.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In school, reading and being able to answer ten questions at the end  <br/>\n&gt; equals perfect learning.  There&#39;s nothing better than 100%, unless  <br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s getting a bonus question too.   And in school, once you&#39;ve  <br/>\n&gt; &quot;passed&quot; a course (such as &quot;Deschooling for Parents&quot;), you never have  <br/>\n&gt; to take it again.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And so a lack of deschooling will make deschooling impossible.<br/>\n&gt; And the lack of a school-aged child might make deschooling nonsensical.<br/>\n&gt; And someone who thinks she&#39;s been unschooling for four years might  <br/>\n&gt; discover that on that day when her child doesn&#39;t go to school, she  <br/>\n&gt; needs to begin deschooling.  Not the child, who hasn&#39;t been to school,  <br/>\n&gt; perhaps.  But the mom, who spent ten or thirteen years in government  <br/>\n&gt; or private school, and then maybe two to ten years in universities or  <br/>\n&gt; something, and maybe taught a while, and then spent four or five years  <br/>\n&gt; thinking she was a graduate of the online deschooling course.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Reciting back what the deschooling articles say isn&#39;t being deschooled.<br/>\n&gt; If that were true, then reading the Bill W book and being able to  <br/>\n&gt; recite it back and pass a test would be as good as actually going to  <br/>\n&gt; meetings and not drinking anymore.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Because unschooling is action, choices and doing, then reading and  <br/>\n&gt; writing about it isn&#39;t unschooling.  It&#39;s helping people prepare  <br/>\n&gt; themselves to make better choices.   Unschooling is a way of being.   <br/>\n&gt; Reading can help people change, but reading doesn&#39;t change your next  <br/>\n&gt; decision.

The past week on this list has seen several mothers of  <br/>\nbabies assuring us they could tell us how to help unschoolers, and  <br/>\nthat our advice was lacking.    (Some of them have apologized, or come  <br/>\nnear it, in side e-mail, so I&#39;m not trying to stir that up again.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI do believe that it must be nearly impossible to begin to deschool in  <br/>\nthe absence of school-age concerns, so it&#39;s possible that the mother  <br/>\nof a baby who reads all the deschooling articles she can find will nod  <br/>\nand say &quot;Yep, got it; done.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn school, reading and being able to answer ten questions at the end  <br/>\nequals perfect learning.  There&#39;s nothing better than 100%, unless  <br/>\nit&#39;s getting a bonus question too.   And in school, once you&#39;ve  <br/>\n&quot;passed&quot; a course (such as &quot;Deschooling for Parents&quot;), you never have  <br/>\nto take it again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so a lack of deschooling will make deschooling impossible.<br/>\nAnd the lack of a school-aged child might make deschooling nonsensical.<br/>\nAnd someone who thinks she&#39;s been unschooling for four years might  <br/>\ndiscover that on that day when her child doesn&#39;t go to school, she  <br/>\nneeds to begin deschooling.  Not the child, who hasn&#39;t been to school,  <br/>\nperhaps.  But the mom, who spent ten or thirteen years in government  <br/>\nor private school, and then maybe two to ten years in universities or  <br/>\nsomething, and maybe taught a while, and then spent four or five years  <br/>\nthinking she was a graduate of the online deschooling course.<br/>\n<br/>\nReciting back what the deschooling articles say isn&#39;t being deschooled.<br/>\nIf that were true, then reading the Bill W book and being able to  <br/>\nrecite it back and pass a test would be as good as actually going to  <br/>\nmeetings and not drinking anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause unschooling is action, choices and doing, then reading and  <br/>\nwriting about it isn&#39;t unschooling.  It&#39;s helping people prepare  <br/>\nthemselves to make better choices.   Unschooling is a way of being.   <br/>\nReading can help people change, but reading doesn&#39;t change your next  <br/>\ndecision.  Your own thoughts and understanding and awareness change  <br/>\nyour next decision.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/doit\">http://sandradodd.com/doit</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/deschooling\">http://sandradodd.com/deschooling</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThose are not single pages.<br/>\nSomeone just wrote and said she had read most of my site.
