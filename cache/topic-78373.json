This group IS too quiet! :-)  (And I have pneumonia and am slow to think, this week.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the response about conversations and being increasingly able to read one’s children.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere’s the post Lori’s asking about:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/2018/05/moonrise.html\">http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/2018/05/moonrise.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nShe quoted the text, but I’m happier when the image and text can stay together.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote it, and it serves me right to be called to explain it.  It’s not as parallel as I imagined it to be.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sometimes it&#39;s good to see cause and effect, connections, relationships.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Other times, it might be best to gaze without speaking.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sometimes it’s fun to say “Oh wow, the reflection of the moon is so cool, and that reminds me of a photo Ashlee sent of Ivan and a mirror, and…”<br/>\n<br/>\nConnections are the best part of learning, in unschooling, in life, for fun.  But if it’s too noisy too often, a quiet moonrise over a lake will get all sound-polluted.  And one person’s thoughts of beauty might be overrun by someone else’s free associations.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just had a thought that will probably end up in Just Add Light, too. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I’ve said that conversations, friendships, relationships, are like a chess game.  You don’t get to plan out all the moves in advance and decide the end.  You get to make ONE move.  Then you wait.  It’s a pretty good analogy, and has helped my kids sometimes when they were frustrated with lack of control or influence in a difficult situation.  But here’s where the chess analogy is NOT good:<br/>\n<br/>\nMoon is rising.  The night is cool,  You’re sitting quietly in a place that was dark and now is lighting up.  You say…<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Look at the clouds.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt’s like moving a pawn out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other person might just say “hmmmm.” and indicate by that “I heard you, and I have nothing to add to that.  I’m looking.”<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it’s chess, it should be played out to the end. :-)  But no one has a right to have the whole game/conversation played out.  (Unless it’s a tournament, or you’ve paid for 50 minutes of talk therapy…  none of my analogies are holding still!!)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo make a move.<br/>\nWait.<br/>\nMaybe the other person really wants to talk about clouds and weather and mystery and fairy tale, airliners and contrails and paranoid theories and North Korea.  Maybe really truly NOT.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- I have moments of such ease and flow, sharing something relevant with my child and then pausing to see if my child is interested or engaged before I share any more of my own observations or follow my child&#39;s lead of further inquiry (or not).-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat sounds perfect.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo human in all the history of the world has, or could have guessed right every time, about what to say, how much to say, how quickly, in what tone…  <br/>\nMost humans can get a bit better at it, as time goes one. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI still say too much or too little with/to my husband, ofter knowing him for 40 years.

Natural learning doesn’t happen in a vacuum or in isolation.  Those things aren’t so natural. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience, unschooling parents are more likely to say too much than not enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best link I think I have about natural discussions with children is “Leaning on a Truck and other parallel play”<br/>\nThe URL is easy to remember.   /truck<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/truck\">http://sandradodd.com/truck</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOh.
