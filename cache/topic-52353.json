Just wanted to let you all know that we(dh & I)took your advice, altered our budget and he has been having one flying lesson a week (considered it a cost of unschooling) since then... yesterday he flew solo for the first time - we all went to see it.. I have never seen such a wide smile on his face, and we have never been happier or prouder:) So thank you all very much for helping us to let go of the if he wants it he should pay for it view and just give him something he needs. His instructor said flying is 10% ability and 90% confidence.. something he was really short on before.
