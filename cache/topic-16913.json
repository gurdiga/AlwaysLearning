I think you cleared up a lot of points about your situation.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt certainly complicates things for you that he isn&#39;t very verbal and <br/>\ncannot really tell you what is going on. One thing, if I might ask - - <br/>\nwhy is it that there is no way to keep him inside if he is inclined to <br/>\ngo out?  Is there anything you can do to change that?  I can keep my 7 <br/>\nyear old in the house.  I don&#39;t mean just by telling him not to go out, <br/>\nwhich does work most of the time, but it might not sometime, when I <br/>\nleast expect it.  I mean, I can physically make it so he cannot go <br/>\noutside.  I have high hook and eye locks on my screen doors, so even it <br/>\nhe gets the inside doors open, he cannot get the screen open.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nuse them all the time, lest you all think my kids are going to die in a <br/>\nfire because they cannot get out of the house, but when I cannot be in <br/>\nimmediately control of what they are doing for a period of time, I will <br/>\nput them on just in case.  I guess it also assures that if my son&#39;s <br/>\nreason lapses and he opens the inside door to someone when I&#39;m out of <br/>\nthe room, the person cannot get in the house.  Perhaps one would hope <br/>\nthat a 7 year old would not become suddenly disobedient, but if he does, <br/>\nI guess physically blocking his exit might be your only hope for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it is any consolation that this might just be a 7 year old thing, my <br/>\n7 year old son is being particularly difficult lately as well.  He is <br/>\nmore argumentative, more whiney, and more difficult with his brother <br/>\nlately than he has ever been in his life.  I too am searching for the <br/>\nroot of the problem, but am having a hard time figuring this one out <br/>\ntoo.  He&#39;s always been my respectful and relatively obedient one. <br/>\n Lately, not so much.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n<br/>\nlescather wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For some reason, my email is acting up and yahoo is not sending me<br/>\n&gt; everything, so I can&#39;t respond properly to all the points made.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I will clear these things up, though.

If we spend more time talking calmly and <br/>\nvery specifically about the problems we are encountering and how he is <br/>\ndisrespecting realistic rules for his safety, it seems to work much <br/>\nbetter.  His friend across the street loses his Nintendo, his bike, and <br/>\nother things when he misbehaves.  I heard him tell my son the other day <br/>\nthat he couldn&#39;t wait until he was old enough to move out so his mom <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t take away his stuff anymore.  He&#39;s 5.  I would be horrified if <br/>\nmy son felt that way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I wouldn&#39;t just let him go outside in the front of the house <br/>\nunsupervised either.  Many is the time I have laid down bills that had <br/>\nto be paid, left laundry unfolded or made quicker food for dinner <br/>\nbecause the boys really wanted to do something outside that absolutely <br/>\nrequired my supervision.  Perhaps that is why my house is never exactly <br/>\ntidy and I&#39;m up until all hours of the night paying the bills sometimes. <br/>\n But if being out there with him isn&#39;t an option, perhaps he needs to be <br/>\nkept in the house until he can be supervised.  He doesn&#39;t have to be <br/>\npunished, just kept in. When I had pneumonia this summer and could not <br/>\nchase them all over the neighborhood, they just had to be inside, like <br/>\nit or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I&#39;m hearing most of all is that it is apparent he is <br/>\nabsolutely not getting the reason for this rule.  He is also not getting <br/>\nthat the rules of the other kids in the neighborhood do not necessarily <br/>\napply to him.  I&#39;m just critical enough about the parenting of others as <br/>\nto tell my sons directly that I don&#39;t think the mother down the street <br/>\ndoes a very good job, and if her children are wandering around the <br/>\nneighborhood unattended, that isn&#39;t something to be envied but rather to <br/>\nbe pitied as clearly their parents do not give enough of a darn about <br/>\ntheir children and their behavior to watch over them well and protect <br/>\nthem from themselves and others.  I try not to be too snipey, but I do <br/>\nwant them to know that sometimes good parents make difficult choices for <br/>\ntheir kids when they are too young to be making absolutely every call <br/>\nfor themselves.  I explain to them that while I like them to be free to <br/>\nroam and enjoy the outdoors, kids their age need an adult around for <br/>\nprotection.  I think your boy needs to understand very clearly why you <br/>\ndon&#39;t want him in front of the house with the scooter, if at all.  It <br/>\nmight take lots of discussion, but it seems that is the core of the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nWas that disjointed enough for you?
