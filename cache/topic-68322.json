Five years ago, Learn Nothing Day was discussed at Unschooling.info, and so there was a forum standing open for ideas and stories.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis year, Learn Nothing Day was mostly discussed on Facebook.  Anyone reading here who isn&#39;t on facebook is probably living a quieter and more peaceful life, and that&#39;s good.  But there are sometimes quick and fun things that happen there (and sometimes unsavory nonsense).   Sometimes I&#39;ve brought a link to some of the best parts.  I&#39;m not recommending anyone join facebook who isn&#39;t already there.  If you are there, though, you might want to join this page, Radical Unschooling Info.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/groups/303347574750/\">http://www.facebook.com/groups/303347574750/</a><br/>\nI created it as a place for announcements, but it&#39;s turned into a discussion, as such things tend to do. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s something I wrote about Learn Nothing Day at my blog: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.blogspot.com/\">http://sandradodd.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n----------------------------------------<br/>\nSomeone (whose name I didn&#39;t save and who should remain anonymous) wrote<br/>\nIs that like smoke-a-cigar day or cut-yourself-on-purpose day? Why chose to damage yourself? Thanks alot Google, we have one more evidence that you are NOT looking out for our interests, rather herding us like sheep being stolen from the shepherd.<br/>\nIn order to blame Google, she would have to NOT READ that I made it up and Holly did the art.<br/>\n----------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect that was written just by a friend of someone else&#39;s friend who saw a graphic that Kelly Halldorson had made that was being passed around.  So clicking it and going back to the original image, someone wrote something very bizarre, about Google, and being a sheep.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s nothing better I can think of to say about all of this than<br/>\nread a little, try a little, wait a while, watch.  <br/>\nAnd maybe start thinking about next summer&#39;s Learn Nothing Day.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68311,"nextTopicId":68323}}
