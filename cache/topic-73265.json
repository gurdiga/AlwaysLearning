Also, not to use them too casually himself either.<br/>\n<br/>\nA friend of Ethan&#39;s used to say that he was going to kill himself when he failed in games they were playing together.  It really bothered Ethan.  I spoke with the friend&#39;s mom, so that she was aware of what he was saying, and I spoke with our friend myself.  I told him that Doug, Ethan and I really cared about him, and when he talks about hurting himself we feel concerned.  He cried.  I wasn&#39;t harsh (I don&#39;t think).  I told him that he can feel free to talk with us any time he needed to.  I told his mom about our exchange.  I don&#39;t think he was really thinking of hurting himself.  He was only nine at the time, but it did bother me to hear him talk that way.  I think he was very sad and overwhelmed with things that were going on in his life.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was a young girl, not too much older than Ethan, I had a friend who talked regularly about killing herself.  On several occasions she went so far as to fake hurting herself to get the attention she was looking for.  People began to not take her seriously.  She really attempted suicide in our last year of high school.  Thankfully she survived, and finally got the help she was needing all along.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like it&#39;s risky to not address it when someone talks about suicide, even when it&#39;s out of simple frustration.
