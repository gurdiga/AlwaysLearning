What might you like?&quot; That&#39;s just playing fair - I just don&#39;t see it <br/>\nas manipulating or bribing. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat Alfie Kohn opposes is positive or negative reinforcement as a way of <br/>\ntrying to &quot;shape&quot; behavior -- it isn&#39;t treating children respectfully, it is <br/>\n&quot;training&quot; them - like an an animal. It works to an extent, of course, and <br/>\nAlfie Kohn admits that it might be useful if ALL you care about is the <br/>\nimmediate results and not the long run consequences. He points out that there <br/>\nare not-so-obvious messages that kids get when parents use behaviorist <br/>\ntechniques on them. When they get told they&#39;ll get a sticker for reading <br/>\nevery few pages of a book, they might think that means that the parent <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t think reading is inherently worthwhile or fun, for example. But I <br/>\nreally think that the greatest harm of such systems is that it dehumanizes <br/>\nthe child; it is disrespectful. This doesn&#39;t, to me, contradict telling other <br/>\npeople when they&#39;ve done things you appreciate. I mean, Sandra telling her <br/>\nhusband that she&#39;s grateful for his genetic stock isn&#39;t her trying to &quot;shape&quot; <br/>\nhim into providing even more good genetic stock &lt;G&gt;. It is just niceness. It <br/>\nis lubricant for ongoing good relationship. I don&#39;t think Alfie Kohn ever <br/>\nmeant that people should not comment on kids behavior - &quot;Wow, that was a long <br/>\nand pretty boring trip. You handled it really well. Thank you.&quot; Say it <br/>\nbecause it is true and because it gives the child pleasure to hear it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":89240901,"authorName":"groundhoggirl","from":"groundhoggirl &lt;groundhoggirl@...&gt;","profile":"groundhoggirl2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] struggling","postDate":"1007882867","msgId":344,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNFNjQ5NTUyLUVDNzYtMTFENS05MzlDLTAwMDM5MzQ5RDRBRUBob3VzdG9uLnJyLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDNDMTJGOEQ1LjE3Q0E5NzRAY3liZXJ0cmFpbHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":343,"nextInTopic":346,"prevInTime":343,"nextInTime":345,"topicId":320,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

They usually understand.  But, there&#39;s still that 10% <br/>\nof the time, however, where they are really disappointed I won&#39;t get <br/>\nthem something and they&#39;ll get upset.  It&#39;s usually Leroy.  He&#39;ll get <br/>\nreally mad and start crying.  I hate to see it and it upsets me, but I <br/>\nhonestly don&#39;t know what to do about it except try and give him a hug <br/>\nand comfort him (if he lets me).   Why isn&#39;t it all right for my son to <br/>\nshow his feelings in this way?    What am I to do about it in this <br/>\nparticular situation?  Yes, modelling absolutely works, but there are <br/>\nstill times when Leroy&#39;s feelings overtake him and I don&#39;t see anything <br/>\nwrong with him showing them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; =================================================================<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The best trick I know is to give yourself two choices, for starters.  If<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;ve been thinking &quot;All I can do is X,&quot; next time give yourself X <br/>\n&gt; and Y<br/>\n&gt; (another, better choice).  If Y works for you, afterward think of <br/>\n&gt; something<br/>\n&gt; that might have worked even better.  Next time, don&#39;t make old, <br/>\n&gt; inferior X a<br/>\n&gt; choice--choose between Y and Z.  Soon you&#39;ll have more than two tried <br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; true choices.<br/>\n&gt; =================================================================<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thank you for this suggestion.

We love to make them happy and I think that is a <br/>\ngood thing.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ================================================================= <br/>\n&gt; Why let a tantrum come and bloom and continue and die when it can be <br/>\n&gt; averted<br/>\n&gt; by sweet and honest communication between people?<br/>\n&gt; =================================================================<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please don&#39;t think that all I say is &quot;NO&quot; and I walk away with my backs <br/>\nto them.  I always explain in a very calm and &quot;sweet&quot; way why I can&#39;t <br/>\nand I tell them that we&#39;ll probably be able to get it another time.  <br/>\nAnd, we usually do.  This usually works almost all of the time, but, <br/>\nlike I said before, once in a great while, it just doesn&#39;t work and <br/>\nLeroy gets upset.

Do you think <br/>\nthat a 6 or 7 year-old can control his feelings as well as an adult?  <br/>\nMine don&#39;t always do and, on the whole, they behave quite well.  I think <br/>\nadults should give children some slack.<br/>\n====================================================================<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  I have read baffling advice from homeschooling moms (and<br/>\n&gt; some others) who are  basically saying &quot;to hell with other people; live <br/>\n&gt; your<br/>\n&gt; life with your child as though other people don&#39;t exist.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; ==================================================================<br/>\n </span></blockquote>On the whole, Leroy is very sweet and pleasant to be around - he&#39;s had <br/>\ngood modeling.  Part of the reason for this modeling is so that he will <br/>\nbe accepted in society.  But, what you quoted above is exactly how I <br/>\nfeel on those rare occasions when he is upset.  I feel I must have this <br/>\nattitude or else I may feel like I must punish Leroy for showing his <br/>\nfeelings.<br/>\n==================================================================<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I try to be considerate of everyone--strangers, waiters, store <br/>\n&gt; personnel, my<br/>\n&gt; children--and the kids pick it up.  If in the course of being cold to <br/>\n&gt; your<br/>\n&gt; children you are also cold and cruel to strangers, who learns what??<br/>\n&gt; ================================================================<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you think I am cold to my children?<br/>\n=================================================================<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;&lt;I don&#39;t believe in giving rewards for good behavior.  Good behavior<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; should be expected.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When my husband does something really sweet I tell him so.  I smile and <br/>\n&gt; hug<br/>\n&gt; him and brag him up to my friends and tell him a few hours later or the <br/>\n&gt; next<br/>\n&gt; day or week or years later what a cool thing it was that he did <br/>\n&gt; whatever it<br/>\n&gt; was for me.  I thanked him the other day for the fine genetic <br/>\n&gt; contribution to<br/>\n&gt; the kids.  He said he never expected to be thanked for that so long <br/>\n&gt; after the<br/>\n&gt; fact.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is that rewarding good behavior?  I hope so.  I would hate to just <br/>\n&gt; expect<br/>\n&gt; good behavior from my husband and for him to have to learn not to expect<br/>\n&gt; positive feedback or reward of any sort, just a flat &quot;no&quot; when I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; want<br/>\n&gt; to do something with or for him.<br/>\n&gt; ================================================================<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You are talking about something totally different.

I would like my <br/>\nboys to behave in the manner they wish to behave, not for a reward or <br/>\njust to please me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do compliment them on their behavior quite often, but certainly not <br/>\nevery single time we go to the store.  I don&#39;t happen to believe that <br/>\nchildren need a compliment for every single thing they do.  Once in a <br/>\nwhile for ordinary things is great and always when there is something <br/>\nexceptional.  My compliments are always very sincere and they mean <br/>\nsomething.  They know I appreciate and love them.  I tell and show them <br/>\nthis all the time.  We are very close and they know I respect them.<br/>\n====================================================================<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Except in the few obvious ways, I don&#39;t treat my children in a lesser <br/>\n&gt; way<br/>\n&gt; than I treat my husband.  It has been crucial to our interactions as an<br/>\n&gt; unschooling family that the kids were people first, and kids only <br/>\n&gt; incidently<br/>\n&gt; and temporarily.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt; ================================================================<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I totally agree.  I treat my children and my husband equally.

Once things calm down and you&#39;re able to do so, you can say to your kids, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I lost my temper like that. I felt really stressed about what was going on, but that&#39;s not the way I want to react. I&#39;m going to work on it. Maybe we can work on our temper tantrums together.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere aren&#39;t many of us who haven&#39;t been there, but if you met most of us in real life, you&#39;d think we were good moms. You are too.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol Narigon, Editor<br/>\nHome Education Magazine&#39;s Online News<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/wlcm_hemnewsltr.html\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/wlcm_hemnewsltr.html</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] struggling","postDate":"1007873200","msgId":333,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3Zi42YzYxMmQuMjk0NDQ2YjBAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":332,"nextInTopic":334,"prevInTime":332,"nextInTime":334,"topicId":320,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Comments on comments...

They can only express their <br/>\n<br/>\nfeelings in certain ways.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf better ways are modelled for them, they have more and better choices, <br/>\nthough.  To say &quot;They&#39;re just kids&quot; is true, but kids are bright, and they <br/>\naren&#39;t acting in a vacuum.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolding one&#39;s temper is great, but it helps to change your beliefs, your <br/>\nattitude, your oxygen level/heart rate and to increase your own range of <br/>\nchoices.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best trick I know is to give yourself two choices, for starters.  If <br/>\nyou&#39;ve been thinking &quot;All I can do is X,&quot; next time give yourself X and Y <br/>\n(another, better choice).  If Y works for you, afterward think of something <br/>\nthat might have worked even better.  Next time, don&#39;t make old, inferior X a <br/>\nchoice--choose between Y and Z.  Soon you&#39;ll have more than two tried and <br/>\ntrue choices.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Even if you&#39;re not calm, you can act calm, and eventually by acting<br/>\ncalm a lot you&#39;ll actually start to feel that way.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGood point.  This is a version of &quot;fake it &#39;til you make it&quot; and also related <br/>\nto my changing your attitude and beliefs.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople make decisions based on their philosophies, their prioirities, their <br/>\nbelief systems.  Even people who don&#39;t think they have belief systems have <br/>\nthings they consider good and bad, acceptable and unacceptable.  Many, <br/>\nunfortunately, give children a slim range of &quot;acceptable&quot; and themselves a <br/>\nHUGE range.  If you change your belief system to say that it&#39;s not far for <br/>\nchildren to take the dregs of life and the adults to enjoy all the fruits and <br/>\nprivilege, then it will affect not only the way your treat your children but <br/>\nthe way you interpret what they say and do.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;The relationship you&#39;re building now is all<br/>\nyou have with your kids, it&#39;s worth really pulling it apart and making it<br/>\ntick better.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes; pam said a wise thing for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Or perhaps he could have a special dinner/movie on the weekend if he&#39;s <br/>\ncontrolled himself all week.  I&#39;d try to find a bonus that he gains by not <br/>\nallowing himself to beg.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nA week is like a lifetime to a little kid.<br/>\nMaybe remembering to thank him when he&#39;s helpful, to say &quot;I&#39;m really glad we <br/>\nhad fun in the store today&quot; if he wasn&#39;t whiney, instead of commenting on the <br/>\nnegative behavior and taking positive behavior for granted.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if kids learn to perform for incentives, it can become a lifetime habit.  <br/>\nShould his wife reward him with food or movies (or whatever wives have) if <br/>\nhe&#39;s good all week?  Meeting his needs first could avert the negative <br/>\nconsequences of neediness.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike...  If I promised Kirby if he was sweet and cooperative all day I&#39;d give <br/>\nhim a high-protein dinner, it would be hard for him.  He&#39;s fairly well <br/>\nhypo-glycemic, and gets a headache if he goes several hours without eating <br/>\nsomething good.  If I give him a protein breakfast and a protein lunch (at <br/>\nleast one or the other), he WILL be sweet.  If I withhold what he needs <br/>\ncontingent on behavior, I&#39;m setting me, him, the family and the neighbors up <br/>\nfor frustration.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;In my opinion, I think it would be best, at this point, to absolutely <br/>\n<br/>\nrefuse to buy the toy, or whatever it is, and stand your ground.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think that&#39;s better than &quot;maybe later.&quot;<br/>\nWhy insult a child and destroy hope?  <br/>\nWhy let a tantrum come and bloom and continue and die when it can be averted <br/>\nby sweet and honest communication between people?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Let the tantrum take it&#39;s course and try and ignore the stares from <br/>\n<br/>\nstrangers as much as possible. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think, when I&#39;m in a store, that the other people have the particular right <br/>\nto shop in peace.  I have read baffling advice from homeschooling moms (and <br/>\nsome others) who are  basically saying &quot;to hell with other people; live your <br/>\nlife with your child as though other people don&#39;t exist.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI try to be considerate of everyone--strangers, waiters, store personnel, my <br/>\nchildren--and the kids pick it up.  If in the course of being cold to your <br/>\nchildren you are also cold and cruel to strangers, who learns what??<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t believe in giving rewards for good behavior.  Good behavior <br/>\n<br/>\nshould be expected.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my husband does something really sweet I tell him so.  I smile and hug <br/>\nhim and brag him up to my friends and tell him a few hours later or the next <br/>\nday or week or years later what a cool thing it was that he did whatever it <br/>\nwas for me.  I thanked him the other day for the fine genetic contribution to <br/>\nthe kids.  He said he never expected to be thanked for that so long after the <br/>\nfact.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that rewarding good behavior?  I hope so.  I would hate to just expect <br/>\ngood behavior from my husband and for him to have to learn not to expect <br/>\npositive feedback or reward of any sort, just a flat &quot;no&quot; when I don&#39;t want <br/>\nto do something with or for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nExcept in the few obvious ways, I don&#39;t treat my children in a lesser way <br/>\nthan I treat my husband.  It has been crucial to our interactions as an <br/>\nunschooling family that the kids were people first, and kids only incidently <br/>\nand temporarily.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":89240901,"authorName":"groundhoggirl","from":"groundhoggirl &lt;groundhoggirl@...&gt;","profile":"groundhoggirl2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] struggling","postDate":"1007873138","msgId":332,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk3QUIzNkUwLUVDNUYtMTFENS05MzlDLTAwMDM5MzQ5RDRBRUBob3VzdG9uLnJyLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDE0NS41ZmMyMTVlLjI5NDQyNTcwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":331,"nextInTopic":333,"prevInTime":331,"nextInTime":333,"topicId":320,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Let <br/>\nthe tantrum take it&#39;s course and try and ignore the stares from <br/>\nstrangers as much as possible.  After your child goes through this <br/>\nexperience a few times s/he will eventually learn that his behavior is <br/>\nnot working.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this doesn&#39;t sound cruel.  But, that is what I would do.  <br/>\nLuckily, I only suffered tantrums in situations like that a few times.  <br/>\nAt this point, my boys (age 7) know that when I say NO it is NO.  I <br/>\nusually give them an honest explanation why it is no and they usually <br/>\nunderstand.  Of course, my boys are older than most of your kids.  But, <br/>\nthis is how I have handled it from the very beginning.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes they are allowed to get a toy and sometimes they are not.  It <br/>\nall depends on the condition of my finances.  So, sometimes they are <br/>\nallowed to choose a toy within a certain price range and sometimes I <br/>\njust can&#39;t afford it.  They seem to understand that very well by now.  I <br/>\nhave found that it is always best to be truthful with my children and <br/>\nlet them know exactly how things are.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t believe in giving rewards for good behavior.  Good behavior <br/>\nshould be expected.  But, at the same time, if they&#39;re having a bad day, <br/>\nor they really have their heart set on something you can&#39;t give them, <br/>\nthen allow them to be upset and ignore the strangers.  This is how my <br/>\nboys and I go shopping.<br/>\n<br/>\nMimi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Saturday, December 8, 2001, at 08:26 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kpgrew96@...\">kpgrew96@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 12/8/2001 8:34:12 PM Eastern Standard Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdeets@...\">jdeets@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; By the time I got the checkout counter I was a wreck inside.

We have curbed a lot of the irritant here by just issuing allowances to<br/>\neveryone (adults and children). My four year old is not a computational<br/>\ngenius, but she trusts me, so if we&#39;re in a store and she wants something, I<br/>\neither tell her how much it is and how much she can afford, or tell her that<br/>\nshe&#39;s out of money until the first of the month. The allowances were agreed<br/>\non as a family, are eligible for review at any time, and seem to work well<br/>\nfor us.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I am also very likely to offer bribes in exchange for accompanying me on<br/>\nboring errands. I try not to drag anyone on boring errands to begin with<br/>\n(bad enough that I have to go!) but when I do, I usually tell the girls to<br/>\npick something under whatever amount we can comfortably afford at the time<br/>\n(some weeks, a buck. &lt;g&gt;) or offer a good activity in exchange for the bad<br/>\n(a trip to the park for a trip to the bank).<br/>\n<br/>\n3. For big wants, I keep all-year Christmas and birthday lists going, and we<br/>\nreview the lists before the major holidays, pare them down, and then send<br/>\nthem to doting grandparents (yes, the grandparents want the lists &lt;g&gt;, and<br/>\nwe parents buy some of the biggies, too. Later, I think they&#39;ll start<br/>\nactually saving money or working for more money, but mine don&#39;t seem<br/>\ninterested yet in long-term planning).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the actual problem (lack of patience, parental tantrums, etc.):<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can control yourself. You might not feel like you can, but you can,<br/>\nbecause you do so in public. That means that yelling, etc. in private is a<br/>\nchoice, not an act of God or nature. :) I don&#39;t say this to be snarky, but<br/>\nbecause I think it&#39;s really helpful to look at it that way -- I *CAN*<br/>\ncontrol myself. It&#39;s my choice if I don&#39;t. If my child were a 31 year old<br/>\nHell&#39;s Angel not related to me, I would not be shrieking at him right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the usual stuff that you would do if an adult drove you nuts will work:<br/>\ndeep breaths, mentally counting to 10, making the decision NOT to yell back,<br/>\netc. Even if you&#39;re not calm, you can act calm, and eventually by acting<br/>\ncalm a lot you&#39;ll actually start to feel that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at what environmental changes you can make to bring the irritation<br/>\nlevel down as far as possible. The relationship you&#39;re building now is all<br/>\nyou have with your kids, it&#39;s worth really pulling it apart and making it<br/>\ntick better.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Jennifer Deets&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdeets@...\">jdeets@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] struggling<br/>\nDate: Sat, Dec 8, 2001, 5:34 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn public with strangers, I appear to be this really patient person, but I<br/>\nstruggle with remaining that patient at home....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":89240901,"authorName":"groundhoggirl","from":"groundhoggirl &lt;groundhoggirl@...&gt;","profile":"groundhoggirl2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] struggling","postDate":"1007863334","msgId":322,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM0MkIyRDNDLUVDNDgtMTFENS05MzlDLTAwMDM5MzQ5RDRBRUBob3VzdG9uLnJyLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMTQwMWMxODA1MSRiNDZlMDUyMCQ4MjdiYThjMEBjZmwucnIuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":321,"nextInTopic":323,"prevInTime":321,"nextInTime":323,"topicId":320,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

As a former very caring public <br/>\nschool teacher let me also tell you that there is NO WAY that they can <br/>\ncare for your children as much as you do.  I have tried.  It is <br/>\nimpossible.  Of course, I was a high school teacher so the ratio was <br/>\nmuch greater than that of an elementary school teacher.  But still, 3:1 <br/>\nis a whole lot better than 20+:1.

I&#39;m sure you&#39;re trying the best you can.  Just try <br/>\nand have more patience.  Keep reading books like that.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; As an example, my son, who is 5, saw a robot toy in Target yesterday. <br/>\n&gt; He said that he wanted it. I told him that we were shopping for <br/>\n&gt; something else and that we couldn&#39;t buy something every time we go into <br/>\n&gt; a store (this begging has been on the increase in the last few months). <br/>\n&gt; We are fortunate to have the means to be able to buy many items, and we <br/>\n&gt; never hesitate when the need is there and we can afford it, but it <br/>\n&gt; makes me nuts to have him beg and whine and beg and whine and beg and <br/>\n&gt; whine -- did I mention that he never stops repeating himself? By the <br/>\n&gt; time I got the checkout counter I was a wreck inside. People in line <br/>\n&gt; behind me were looking at me like &quot;do something with that kid!&quot; I <br/>\n&gt; should add that his little sister had picked up the chant, wouldn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; stay seated, and was not really helping things at all. Oh, and our <br/>\n&gt; oldest decided to throw in some tears also -- she wanted to continue <br/>\n&gt; our shopping, but I was not about to spend another minute in the store. <br/>\n&gt; I had gotten! the main thing I needed and I was ready to flee.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I know exactly what you mean.  I have learned to ignore strangers.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to get into what steps you need to stop the whining.  Maybe <br/>\nsomeone else can do that for you.  I definitely ignore the strangers and <br/>\nalways remember that my children are more important than strangers.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; When we got out in the parking lot and into the van, I turned around <br/>\n&gt; and yelled at Britton. I lectured and chastised and lectured some more. <br/>\n&gt; By the time we got home, all of us were spent. And I sobbed, wondering <br/>\n&gt; how I can know this is not good and still be unable to change, thereby <br/>\n&gt; unable to model the consistent kind, gentleness I dream of being the <br/>\n&gt; tone of our home.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I hate to say that I have yelled at my kids too.  I only have 2 and they <br/>\nare already 7 years old, so I know it&#39;s a lot easier for me right now <br/>\nthan it is for you.  But, when my boys were 4 and 5 and I think back to <br/>\nmy behavior back then, I am truly ashamed.  But, there were some other <br/>\nthings going on with my marriage and my having to work, etc.  It was a <br/>\nvery stressful time.  It is very difficult, but just KEEP TRYING to do <br/>\nthe right thing.  It will definitely get better as they get older.  If <br/>\nyou keep trying, the sooner it will get better.  That&#39;s my opinion.  You <br/>\nreally do have your hands full.  I can&#39;t imagine having 3 children that <br/>\nage.  Remember, you are only human and you are allowed to make <br/>\nmistakes.  My boys are very happy right now and the bad times didn&#39;t <br/>\nseem to have any effect on them.  Thank goodness.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Before anyone gets to antsy about pointing out my faults, I really do <br/>\n&gt; see them; what I need your suggestions with is moving forward from <br/>\n&gt; here. In public with strangers, I appear to be this really patient <br/>\n&gt; person, but I struggle with remaining that patient at home....<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My only adivice, again, is to just keep trying your best to hold your <br/>\ntemper.  Remember, they are only children.  They can only express their <br/>\nfeelings in certain ways.  Always ignore the strangers and always try <br/>\nyour best.  I thinks it&#39;s only a matter of time before things get <br/>\nbetter.  This is the advice of a very less than perfect mother who loves <br/>\nher children very much and wants the very best for them.  And, remember, <br/>\nas a former teacher, I can honestly say that NO ONE can care for your <br/>\nchildren as much as you or your husband.  This is my opinion and <br/>\nadvice.  I&#39;m sorry if this post did not offer any constructive <br/>\nsuggestions.

I&#39;ve had trouble brewing and I wondered whether you&#39;d be able to help...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children are 7, 5, and 2 -- girl, boy, girl. Each of them delights me and makes me crazy in their own ways. Each and every time (which has been more frequently lately due to the end of the semester (I teach), my husband&#39;s military obligation for two weeks, and my dad&#39;s recent death) I say something harshly or impatiently or, yes, with an ugly face and loud voice, I see myself watching me and wonder how that woman deserves to be a mother and what makes her think she is any better for those precious, impressionable, regular kids than caring people in an institution like school?....  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am reading &quot;Living Joyfully with Children&quot; and feel more and more inept as I go. I read about these wonderful things that the family does and I wonder how I can even begin to try to change some bad habits our family has developed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an example, my son, who is 5, saw a robot toy in Target yesterday. He said that he wanted it. I told him that we were shopping for something else and that we couldn&#39;t buy something every time we go into a store (this begging has been on the increase in the last few months). We are fortunate to have the means to be able to buy many items, and we never hesitate when the need is there and we can afford it, but it makes me nuts to have him beg and whine and beg and whine and beg and whine -- did I mention that he never stops repeating himself? By the time I got the checkout counter I was a wreck inside. People in line behind me were looking at me like &quot;do something with that kid!&quot; I should add that his little sister had picked up the chant, wouldn&#39;t stay seated, and was not really helping things at all. Oh, and our oldest decided to throw in some tears also -- she wanted to continue our shopping, but I was not about to spend another minute in the store. I had gotten the main thing I needed and I was ready to flee.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we got out in the parking lot and into the van, I turned around and yelled at Britton. I lectured and chastised and lectured some more. By the time we got home, all of us were spent. And I sobbed, wondering how I can know this is not good and still be unable to change, thereby unable to model the consistent kind, gentleness I dream of being the tone of our home.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore anyone gets to antsy about pointing out my faults, I really do see them; what I need your suggestions with is moving forward from here. In public with strangers, I appear to be this really patient person, but I struggle with remaining that patient at home....<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":368,"nextTopicId":560}}
