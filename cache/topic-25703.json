It says in one recipe: &quot;If you live in a country where  <br/>\nGraham crackers aren&#39;t available, simply use Digestive biscuit crumbs  <br/>\ninstead and omit the sugar.&quot; So that suggests Digestive biscuits  <br/>\nwould be sweeter than graham crackers.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s two Australian s&#39;mores recipes:<br/>\n==========<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Guides love cooking (and eating) S&#39;mores but we don&#39;t use graham  <br/>\ncrackers and chocolate instead we use a biscuit (cookie) called Choc  <br/>\nWeatens. It&#39;s like an ordinary plain biscuit with a chocolate coating  <br/>\non one side.<br/>\nThe girls toast their marshmallow then sandwich it between two  <br/>\nbiscuits with the chocolate on the marshmallow side. Yummo!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan Cokley<br/>\nLeader - Pt Danger Guides<br/>\nAustralia<br/>\n<br/>\n===========<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were first exposed to them in 2004 (here) and we have started  <br/>\nusing an Australian equivalent. We don&#39;t have Graham crackers here  <br/>\nand we wanted nicer chocolate than Hershey&#39;s and tasty Australian  <br/>\nMarshmallows.<br/>\n<br/>\nAustralian Smores<br/>\nIngredients<br/>\n2 Morning Coffee biscuits<br/>\n2 Marshmallows<br/>\n2 squares Cadbury chocolate<br/>\n<br/>\nMethod<br/>\nMelt the marshmallows over fire embers. The outside whould be thin  <br/>\nand crunchy with the centre all melted.<br/>\nPlace the chocolate on the biscuit and using the top biscuit move the  <br/>\nmarshmallow from the stick onto the biscuit and squeeze. The  <br/>\nmarshmallow melds the top and bottom biscuit with the chocolate  <br/>\nmeling in the middle. The name comes from the first thing the person  <br/>\neating it says with their mouth full, &quot;&#39;smore please&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n==========<br/>\nHoney Graham Crackers Recipe<br/>\nIngredients<br/>\n1/3 cup milk<br/>\n1/4 cup honey<br/>\n1-1/2 cups graham flour (whole wheat may be substituted)<br/>\n1 cup all-purpose flour<br/>\n1/4 cup brown sugar, packed<br/>\n1 tsp baking powder<br/>\n1/2 tsp baking soda<br/>\n1/3 cup butter<br/>\n1/4 cup shortening<br/>\n<br/>\nInstructions<br/>\nIn a small bowl stir together milk and honey. Set milk mixture aside.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a large bowl stir together graham flour, all-purpose flour, brown  <br/>\nsugar, baking powder, baking soda, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Using a  <br/>\npastry blender, cut in butter and shortening till mixture resembles  <br/>\ncoarse crumbs. Make a well in center of flour mixture. Add milk  <br/>\nmixture all at once. Using a fork, stir till mixture can be gathered  <br/>\ninto a ball. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead  <br/>\ndough by gently folding and pressing dough for 12 to 15 strokes or  <br/>\ntill dough is nearly smooth. Divide dough in half.<br/>\n<br/>\nSprinkle surface with additional graham flour. Roll each half of  <br/>\ndough to 1/8-inch thickness. Using a pastry wheel or sharp knife, cut  <br/>\ndough into 2-inch squares. Place on ungreased baking sheet. Using the  <br/>\ntines of a fork, prick crackers well. Bake in a 350-degree F oven for  <br/>\n12 to 15 minutes or until done. Remove crackers from sheet and cool  <br/>\non a wire rack.<br/>\n<br/>\nVARIATION:<br/>\nCinnamon Graham Crackers<br/>\nPrepare Honey Graham Crackers as directed above, except stir 1/4  <br/>\nteaspoon ground cinnamon into the flour mixture. After pricking the  <br/>\ncrackers, sprinkle crackers with a mixture of 3 Tablespoons sugar and  <br/>\n1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon.<br/>\n<br/>\nYield: 72 crackers<br/>\n<br/>\nCredits<br/>\nRecipe from: Better Homes & Gardens<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\nAnswers to common unschooling questions:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/\">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/</a><br/>\nBlog of writing prompts for speculative fiction writers:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dragonwritingprompts.blogsome.com/\">http://dragonwritingprompts.blogsome.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210653085,"authorName":"Kim H","from":"&quot;Kim H&quot; &lt;kimlewismark@...&gt;","profile":"kimhoussenloge","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] S&#39;Mores (was confused about unschooling)","postDate":"1146812792","msgId":25756,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMWIwMWM2NzAxMiQ3MGE4MmRiMCRiMWUzZWNkY0BraW04Y2U4YWYzNTQzZT4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwNzkwMWM2NmVhNCRkOTU5YzlmMCQ2NTAwYThjMEBlYm9ueT4gPDAwOTAwMWM2NmY3NyQ5NWUwM2NkMCQ4YTQxNmMzYUBraW04Y2U4YWYzNTQzZT4gPDJENDlCMkQ4LTQ3M0UtNDYwQS1CQ0IxLTRDQjAyRjhFNTQzRUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDQ0NUEyQkY3LjQwNjA3MDVAYnRvcGVud29ybGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":25755,"nextInTopic":25757,"prevInTime":25755,"nextInTime":25757,"topicId":25703,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-941618508\">&lt;I don&#39;t know if Australia has graham crackers, they have Kraft Mac and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Cheese &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ooohhh, yuk!

Estée Lauder makes Resilience Lift Eye Crème and Hanes<br/>\nmakes Resilience Pantyhose. But in psychology, resilience has a specific<br/>\nmeaning. It&#39;s the word for springing back from serious adversity, like<br/>\nabuse, war or natural disasters. You exhibit resilience (as opposed to<br/>\nplain competence) if you cope with terrible misfortune and live a<br/>\nrelatively successful life as defined by mental health, success in<br/>\nschool or at work or solid relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn studies of the long-term effects of physical and sexual child abuse,<br/>\n20 to 40 percent of victims show few signs of behavioral or<br/>\nmental-health problems. And many of them don&#39;t appear damaged later in<br/>\nlife. As Ann Masten, a resilience researcher, has written, resilient<br/>\nchildren have the benefit of &quot;ordinary magic.&quot; When it comes to abuse<br/>\nvictims, though, this finding is rarely trumpeted, for fear that saying<br/>\nabuse isn&#39;t always inevitably harmful is tantamount to saying it&#39;s not<br/>\nalways bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the last several decades, a small group of researchers has tried to<br/>\nunderstand how a minority of maltreated children exceed  <br/>\nexpectations. . .<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":194790463,"authorName":"diana","from":"&quot;diana&quot; &lt;hahamommy@...&gt;","profile":"dianajenner","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: confused about unschooling-why?","postDate":"1146756017","msgId":25738,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUzZDYzaCtwNmo2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":25736,"nextInTopic":25739,"prevInTime":25737,"nextInTime":25739,"topicId":25703,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... parents ... world ...

We usually had a lot of fun.  Do you have any historical museums or<br/>\n  forts you can visit?  Museums, children&#39;s museums, art museums, zoos, animal<br/>\n  sanctuaries, a neighbor with a farm?  Another thing that I did often with my<br/>\n  children esp. when they were smaller was play board games.  We all enjoy<br/>\n  them and they are a lot of fun.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Here is a list of fun ideas I made for the days we couldn&#39;t think of<br/>\n  something to do. (before we were horse crazy) <br/>\n<br/>\n  Play mailman - At our house we each live in a different room. We use a box<br/>\n  or container for our mailbox and we send each other notes, bills, and<br/>\n  homemade junk mail. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Listen to books on tape - They are especially great for in the car. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Finger knitting.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Finger crochet.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Plastic canvas and yarn projects .<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hand sewing (felt works well for little ones), make bean bags, rice bags (to<br/>\n  heat and sleep with), stuffed animals, doll blankets and pillows, and other<br/>\n  doll items. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Read aloud.  Ask your friends or email buddies what their favorites are. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Make bubble gum - you can buy gum base on line in a craft kit for under $10<br/>\n  if you look around.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Make silly putty- recipes on-line .<br/>\n<br/>\n  Borax snowflakes- recipes on line.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Blow soap bubbles when it&#39;s below zero, they freeze and break when they<br/>\n  crash. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Rent a movie. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Go to a museum, children&#39;s, state, history, art, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Play store - Price items in your home and use real or play money and take<br/>\n  turns being the cashier.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Scavenger hunt - inside or outside, finding the things on your list or find<br/>\n  things other have hidden.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Learn to follow a compass and make an Orienteering course to follow to find<br/>\n  a treasure.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Bury a time capsule.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Have some friends over for a club with a theme.  My kids like Club Survivor<br/>\n  or Fear Factor, where they dare each other to eat gross things and win<br/>\n  prizes. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Guess the smell...blindfolded <br/>\n<br/>\n  Guess the item (by feel) ...blindfolded. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Ask for a tour of a local business. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Make candles, soap, or candy.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Go for a nature walk and collect rocks and leaves.  See if you can identify<br/>\n  the trees or leaves.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit a local farm and bring the animals a treat.  Horses and goats love<br/>\n  carrots or apples.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Volunteer at a farm to brush the horses or goats, shovel stalls, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Go skiing, snow shoeing, or sliding.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Go to the beach or go camping.  It doesn&#39;t have to be 80 degrees out.  The<br/>\n  beach is beautiful when it is 50 and sunny.  The sand is warm and the wind<br/>\n  gives you healthy rosy cheeks.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Build a campfire in your yard (might need a permit) and toast marshmallows<br/>\n  or make smores. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Play a board game or a card game. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Write a story.  Pick a topic and get going...You could have a story night<br/>\n  with a different topic each week.  Mystery, Horror, Love, Family,<br/>\n  Non-fiction, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Make your own newspaper about your family.  You can put in pictures too.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Make paper Decorate your house for the next holiday...hearts on the windows,<br/>\n  snowflakes hanging from the ceiling, shamrocks, pumpkins, leaves, bats, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Make tissue paper snowflakes. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Make a bank or mask from paper mache&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Make clay pots with self drying clay. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Paint ornaments or little wooden figures from the craft store. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Paint a picture. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Tie dye your underwear, socks, or t-shirts.<br/>\n<br/>\n  String beads for necklaces or bracelets.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Make necklaces or bracelets out of cotton string.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Paint a clay flower pot with a whimsical motif.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Work with polymer clay, make pins, beads, little figures, or magnets.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Make cards with rubber stamps.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Make a bank from recyclable plastic containers.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Print out coloring pages with your favorite theme and color them. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Buy shrinky dinks, color and shrink them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Angela<br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n    _____  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  SPONSORED LINKS Unschooling  Attachment parenting  John holt  <br/>\n        Parenting magazine  Single parenting  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  YAHOO!

Instead of <br/>\nthinking &#39;they&#39;, think &#39;us&#39;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think sometimes it&#39;s difficult for adults to play with children.  <br/>\nAfterall, children can be silly and immature and use their <br/>\nimaginations a great deal.  These are things that aren&#39;t generally <br/>\nassociated with being an adult.  In our family, there are some <br/>\nthings the kids do that I don&#39;t participate in, such as role playing <br/>\nStar Wars.

I am also a dreamer, and a reader, and<br/>\ntend to drift off and isolate myself. being present is<br/>\n*not* what we&#39;re taught in this culture! after all, if<br/>\nNOW is fine, how can you be manipulated?! ;) I still<br/>\nstruggle with this, but I hear it gets easier lol!<br/>\n<br/>\nyou mentioned anxiety, and in that as well as what I<br/>\nquoted above I recognize some things I have been<br/>\nthrough. I don&#39;t know how bad your anxiety is, but a<br/>\nfew months ago I was experiencing severe panic<br/>\nattacks. I have had them in the past, many years ago<br/>\nbefore I became a mom, but nothing like these. anxiety<br/>\nand depression go hand in hand, as you may know, and I<br/>\nhear depression in your statements about having<br/>\nnothing interesting in your life. you mentioned that<br/>\nyou are getting treated for the anxiety; this can mean<br/>\nmany things, but your statement was a passive one.<br/>\nultimately YOU will have to decide to stand up and<br/>\nchange your life. medication can be useful and even<br/>\nnecessary-- it was for me for a very brief period--<br/>\nbut solving the problem (why you&#39;re depressed and<br/>\nanxious) is what will resolve the symptoms<br/>\npermanently. I happen to have a great therapist who<br/>\nknows me very well and operates from a similar pov to<br/>\nmine, and one session with her really shifted my<br/>\nthinking. I&#39;m slipping a little OT here, pausing to<br/>\nthink... when I was at my worst I frantically started<br/>\nlooking into preschools and applying for jobs. luckily<br/>\nnothing panned out, while it kept me busy enough to<br/>\nfigure out what was going on. here&#39;s what I figured<br/>\nout as it pertains to parenting and unschooling<br/>\n(parenthetical summaries where I could think of them):<br/>\n<br/>\n1. meeting my own needs means that I can be the<br/>\nunschooling mom I need and want to be. (recharge)<br/>\n2. I found some of my hs&#39;ing books and remembered why<br/>\nI believe in this approach. (reaffirm)<br/>\n3. I realized my social and intellectual needs were<br/>\nstarving, and started seeking outlets for myself.<br/>\n(recharge) imo, this is extremely important modeling.<br/>\nhow do you want your kids to take care of themselves<br/>\nas adults?<br/>\n4. I noticed all the signals my body had been giving<br/>\nme over many months that I had ignored, so that I had<br/>\nto be &quot;hit over the head&quot; with panic attacks before I<br/>\nwould change anything. (listen to self)<br/>\n5. I got online and found this list and the AU list.<br/>\nfrom there, by mentioning my location, I found some<br/>\nsemi-local moms-- one that I actually knew irl! (get<br/>\nconnected)<br/>\n6. I looked at all the areas of elevated stress in my<br/>\nlife-- there were quite a few-- and started taking<br/>\nconcrete steps to make changes. as long as I was<br/>\ntaking some baby step, I could steer clear of the<br/>\npanic. (take action!)<br/>\n7. I consciously worked on reconnecting with nature.<br/>\nfor me, this is my constant, my place where I can find<br/>\nthat feeling that life is meaningful. if it works for<br/>\nyou too, it&#39;s getting easier now that we&#39;re moving<br/>\ninto summer-- make sure you&#39;re not deprived of natural<br/>\nlight, get your hands in dirt, even if you don&#39;t<br/>\ngarden, which I highly recommend! (get connected)<br/>\n8. I started exercising, very important for clearing<br/>\nthose toxic panic feelings and the associated<br/>\nbiochemistry. (be healthy)<br/>\n<br/>\nso my suggestion, then, would be to figure out what<br/>\nyou need to recharge and feel that your life is<br/>\nmeaningful, and go get it!

I have a little list<br/>\nof things I know my children enjoy and ask me to do with them often and also<br/>\nnew ideas we think of, (baking, sewing, board games, craft projects,<br/>\nswimming, hiking, wood working, puzzles, etc.) I go to this list often,<br/>\nespecially when I start to get that panicky feeling, and ask the kids if<br/>\nthey would like to do this or that today. We&#39;ve only been unschooling for<br/>\nabout a year now so I know very well these feelings you&#39;re having. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, read some Holt if you haven&#39;t already. I had a very difficult time<br/>\nunderstanding unschooling until I read some of his books.

Jot down what you see them doing, conversations you have<br/>\nwith them or that they have with each other, or new discoveries they make,<br/>\nor what you all did today, or all of this. Keep a journal if it makes you<br/>\nfeel more organized. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also went through a long period of not having any hobbies or interests of<br/>\nmy own too. I am still working on that but I am a little better. When we<br/>\nstopped homeschooling and I realized I had spent a year doing lesson plans<br/>\nand lessons,  I had made that my whole life. When we started unschooling I<br/>\nhad nothing to fill my days anymore. Nothing of my own. When I started to<br/>\nrelax a little I found a few things I enjoy but I&#39;m still a work in progress<br/>\nas far as that goes. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been right where you are now and it sucks but it will get better if<br/>\nyou stop holding on to the ideas of what &quot;should be&quot; happening in your home.<br/>\nJust live life. Work WITH your kids, talk to them about how you feel. When I<br/>\nwas going though this I told my ds that I thought I was a terrible mother.<br/>\nHe said, &quot;You&#39;re a great mom!&quot; I told him I didn&#39;t feel that way at all. He<br/>\nsaid, &quot;Well, it doesn&#39;t really matter what you think. It only matters what<br/>\nwe think.&quot; He was right. I had to stop beating myself up and live up to what<br/>\nthey knew I was. Discuss your feelings with them and the changes you are<br/>\ntrying to make within yourself. Don&#39;t be afraid to share your feelings and<br/>\nthoughts with your kids. They will feel joy that you are confiding in them<br/>\nand making yourself venerable. Unschooling is a big transition especially<br/>\nfor those of us that are so schooled we can&#39;t se past so many things.

I don&#39;t post much <br/>\nat all, but I am starting to feel like I just don&#39;t get unschooling. <br/>\nIn theory, yes it makes total sense to me. And, the thought of <br/>\nsending my kids to school just doesn&#39;t make sense to me. (And the <br/>\nfact that they don&#39;t want to). My problem is that I read about all <br/>\nof these cool, fun things that other people do, and I just don&#39;t see <br/>\nthat happening for us. I have all of these ideas in my head, but <br/>\nseem to have a hard time bringing them to fruition. I feel like a <br/>\ndeadbeat. I am not writing this to get sympathy, I know that is not <br/>\nwhat this list is all about.  I am getting some help for anxiety, so <br/>\nthat is part of my problem. I am overwelmed with &quot;should be&#39;s&quot;, <br/>\nwhich leads to anxiety,which leads to me doing nothing. Maybe I need <br/>\nto be de-schooled more?! I think if someone told me what to do with <br/>\nthe kids each day, I could do it. I know unschooling isn&#39;t like this <br/>\nthough. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are watching too much tv right now because they are bored. I <br/>\nhave read so many books and articles and it all makes complete <br/>\nsense. It is putting these things into real life that I don&#39;t get. <br/>\nMy kids don&#39;t have these cool projects going on. They do play <br/>\noutside alot, and with some neighbor kids, and they are each taking <br/>\na class (gymnastics and trampoline). It just doesn&#39;t feel &quot;right&quot; to <br/>\nme. I am trying to be more present, which is a big problem for me. I <br/>\ntend to escape in reading, I am working on this. Another problem is <br/>\nthat I don&#39;t feel like I have interesting things going on in my <br/>\nlife. The worst part is that I can&#39;t really think of anything that <br/>\nsounds interesting to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what I am asking for.

I don&#39;t post much <br/>\nat all, but I am starting to feel like I just don&#39;t get unschooling. <br/>\nIn theory, yes it makes total sense to me. And, the thought of <br/>\nsending my kids to school just doesn&#39;t make sense to me. (And the <br/>\nfact that they don&#39;t want to). My problem is that I read about all <br/>\nof these cool, fun things that other people do, and I just don&#39;t see <br/>\nthat happening for us. I have all of these ideas in my head, but <br/>\nseem to have a hard time bringing them to fruition. I feel like a <br/>\ndeadbeat. I am not writing this to get sympathy, I know that is not <br/>\nwhat this list is all about.  I am getting some help for anxiety, so <br/>\nthat is part of my problem. I am overwelmed with &quot;should be&#39;s&quot;, <br/>\nwhich leads to anxiety,which leads to me doing nothing. Maybe I need <br/>\nto be de-schooled more?! I think if someone told me what to do with <br/>\nthe kids each day, I could do it. I know unschooling isn&#39;t like this <br/>\nthough. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are watching too much tv right now because they are bored.

I am trying to be more present, which is a big problem for me. I <br/>\ntend to escape in reading, I am working on this. Another problem is <br/>\nthat I don&#39;t feel like I have interesting things going on in my <br/>\nlife. The worst part is that I can&#39;t really think of anything that <br/>\nsounds interesting to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what I am asking for.
