I was going to say, that more<br/>\nthan anything, we are always saying nice things about each other.  We<br/>\npoint out each others good qualities, more than pointing out our faults.<br/>\nWhen you intentionally set out to focus on the good in others, you&#39;ll<br/>\nsee it more and people will behave more like their good qualities.  That<br/>\nis what happens with my kids and how they see each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure how else to say that, but how it plays out, is<br/>\ncomplimenting each other and noticing and pointing out when we do good<br/>\nthings or cool things.

They sting a bit, but there is a lot of truth there! When I said &quot;wishy-washy,&quot; that might have been the wrong word. What I meant was that I have vacilated between more conventional forms of parenting and gentle parenting. I read some books early on in my parenting that gave me a very punitive mind set.I am really trying to stop thinking that way- but as Joyce pointed out, punitive parenting focuses on the negative. For example, when one son calls the other one an&quot;idiot,&quot; my first reaction is: &quot;I have to stop this name calling. If I make it undesirable to name call, he won&#39;t do it anymore..&quot; Now I know this is wrong, and what I think is required is a whole mind shift-focusing on the children as people that I love, instead of focusing on behavior. I have a lot of food or thought. Thanks so much for the input, and I&#39;ll keep you &quot;posted&quot; as to what happens :).</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] NAME CALLING AMONGST SIBLINGS","postDate":"1241010827","msgId":44428,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFEODRCRTc2LTcyMTgtNDA2RS1COEQ1LUNGNjE0NkUxMUNGM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGd0OGFxcyszOGl0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGd0OGFxcyszOGl0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44427,"nextInTopic":44434,"prevInTime":44427,"nextInTime":44429,"topicId":44413,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I am trying very hard to stay committed to a non-punitive style of parenting(I have been wishy-washy on this topic-usually b/c there are certain behaviors I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2140352159\">-=-I am trying very hard to stay committed to a non-punitive style of  <br/>\nparenting(I have been wishy-washy on this topic-usually b/c there are  <br/>\ncertain behaviors I have a strong desire to extinguish)-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nExtinguish as in &quot;put the fire out&quot;?  &quot;Kill&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re wishy-washy, that&#39;s about rules, and not about principles.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease read here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/rules\">http://sandradodd.com/rules</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re looking at &quot;commitment&quot; and &quot;style of parenting&quot; and &quot;behavior&quot;  <br/>\ninstead of looking at each person&#39;s feelings and needs, including  <br/>\nyours.
