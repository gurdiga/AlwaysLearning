It is for nightowls and<br/>\nothers who tend to spend most of their awake hours when others are<br/>\nasleep, a habit we got into when my husband had odd shift hours.<br/>\nHomeschooling after Midnight is designed as a virtual support group<br/>\nfor nightowls.  It will give an environment that is supportive to<br/>\nyour homeschooling, but give you an interactive group that are on<br/>\nwhen you are.  It offers a freedom to post when you are up and<br/>\nthinking about topics, without wondering what people will think of<br/>\nyou when they see a timestamp of 3:45am.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my youngest reached &#39;school age&#39;, our friends would kiddingly<br/>\nask if we did her school work at midnight and sheepishly I said yes.<br/>\nIt was the time of day when she was most creative and attuned to<br/>\nlearning, so it fit our family.
