It would leave me feeling like I couldn&#39;t live according to my own principle.   I couldn&#39;t drive for fear of splattering bees on my windshield or exacerbating someone&#39;s asthma.     <br/>\n<br/>\n***&quot;Try to be the source of good in the world.&quot;***<br/>\n<br/>\nI like this too, but it&#39;s too big for me and I couldn&#39;t (and wouldn&#39;t want to) live up to it in all things.  <br/>\nAfter having taken care of my father when he was dying, my mother in her illness and my aunt at various times of need and my in-laws, I feel less and less inclined to try be the source of good in the world.  Maybe I&#39;m getting old.  The world is full of misery and while I feel it more deeply than I wish I did, I am not equipped to fix it.    I believe Pam was talking more about her world: Family, friends, coworkers, unschoolers and how that in various ways and times might radiate out into the larger world.  And I&#39;m glad Pam is up for this because she&#39;s been a source of good in my little world for many years. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m pretty comfortable with,  *Try not to do anything horrible to your fellow creatures.*   The negative wording suits my dark nature&lt;g&gt; and &quot;horrible&quot; lets me choose to be, on occasions I think it warranted, direct, abrupt or uncivil without feeling I made great compromises.&lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI moved my mother into a nursing home last fall.  She has dementia and I had been taking care of her (with my sister, trading off) for many years.  I didn&#39;t want to be the source of good for my mom any more.  It was costing me a lot, physically, emotionally,  it was costing my family a lot.   I *could* take care of her until she dies,  keep her with family, with people who really know her, but I don&#39;t want to and so I did something that was unpleasant for her.   Not horrible, but surely not good.<br/>\n<br/>\nI confronted a mom who hit her child and knocked him down, and I suppose she thought of me and of my interference as horrible, but I saw it (chose to see it&lt;g&gt;) as justified.   She may have felt some anger but I don&#39;t consider her displeasure horrible.  Surely not worse than walloping someone a third your size.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIt also lets me speak or act out against stupidity or injustice when I see it, when it&#39;s in my power to do so, but doesn&#39;t have the effect of making me feel inclined to go out into the world and fight stupidity and injustice wherever it occurs.   Fighting injustice wherever it occurs is a great thing!  But I&#39;m not up to such an enormous task.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt lets me consider that other creatures value their existence and peace as much as I value mine and so I try to live like that matters.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe benefit of having guiding principles is that, as Pam pointed out, they aid in making decisions.

Kids can parrot parental expectations without agreeing or sharing the same &quot;truths&quot;. Those are your principles, but not necessarily those of your children, not truths but goals or ideals. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 1) No diminishing.  Period.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a rule that seems to have some baggage behind it! Do you struggle not to put down things your children say and do? That was something I struggled with when Ray was little - in my experience, it was how parents taught children to be adults, but diminishing everything childish. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnderstanding the reasons behind your own rules can help you find your principles (or values or whatever you want to call them) and that includes the baggage and fears that lead you to feel a need to make a rule. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a rule applied to others, &quot;no diminishing&quot; seems dismissive. If you&#39;ve modeled putting your kids down, then they&#39;ll do it to one another. Making a rule becomes a case of &quot;do as I say, not as I do&quot;. If you haven&#39;t modeled that sort of behavior, then rather than dismissing the needs of the person being rude and dismissive, look directly at those needs. What frustration or unhappiness led your child to call a sibling stupid (or whatever)? How can you address those needs better, now and in the future? A rule &quot;no diminishing&quot; doesn&#39;t get to the &quot;why&quot; - and so it diminishes you and your family. Its an end point. Principles are starting places. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4) Respect of autonomy, intelligence, self-esteem, intellectual and physical development, and value is instilled in every activity<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a contradiction between &quot;respect of autonomy&quot; and &quot;instilled&quot;. If you&#39;re instilling, you are assuming someone&#39;s autonomous decision making will send him or her in the wrong direction. If you begin from the perspective that kids (and adults, too) are doing the best they can, there&#39;s nothing to instill. Instead your focus can shift to &quot;how can I help?&quot; And that shift moves you closer to your principles of respect and esteem.<br/>\n<br/>\nAutonomy is an idea that means widely different things to different people. As a principle, that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing as long as *you* are clear what you mean by it, but in a discussion its problematic. Why do you want to respect isolation and disconection (which is how some people will read &quot;autonomy&quot;)?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 5) Our goal: A wholly loved child, respected and upheld, given the freedom and space to grow as she will, naturally, and without our impedance. A wholly loving and open partnership (marriage in our case), where we share each other with our daughter, while retaining our personal relationship with one another.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>************<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are your principles in the sense we mean. 1-4 are more like rules or reminders - things that come out of your own childhood, perhaps, or your spouse&#39;s. You have a lot to say about upholding and avoiding put-downs, so I&#39;m guessing you got a lot of that! <br/>\n<br/>\nGeorge, my partner, needed a lot of support when Ray was younger, in terms finding alternatives to put-downs. Just like with kids, it helped to assume he was doing the best he could in the moment, and look for ways to help him do better - which included openly appreciating him when he *did* do better, when he was warm and kind and thoughtful rather than sharp and dismissive. And in terms of unschooling, it also meant not putting him down when he floundered around, not having better tools in the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Principles","postDate":"1301484576","msgId":60468,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRCNjNEQTI5LTA3NjMtNDgzNS1CMzYyLURBQUJDQ0ExQzNFQ0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDg0MjUwNy4xNDI4MC5xbUB3ZWI4MzUwMi5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDkyNDcyNy45NjgxMS5xbUB3ZWI4MzUwMS5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+IDw4RUEyQTQ1Qi00OUMyLTQxQzEtOTZBQi00MzdFQjU0MDZGRDhAdmVyaXpvbi5uZXQ+IDw4NDI1MDcuMTQyODAucW1Ad2ViODM1MDIubWFpbC5zcDEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":60467,"nextInTopic":60469,"prevInTime":60467,"nextInTime":60469,"topicId":60448,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

If you brush the need  <br/>\naside for a lesson on how we need to be kind to each other, the child  <br/>\nisn&#39;t likely to listen.

Wouldn&#39;t you want them to fix the jam?<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t assume that just because kids are doing something unkind that  <br/>\nthey don&#39;t understand about kindness. And don&#39;t assume that since they  <br/>\nknow to be kind they&#39;re, therefore, deliberately choosing unkindness.  <br/>\nAssume they want to be kind, that they know about kindness, and don&#39;t  <br/>\nknow how to be kind in this particular situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nUse your principles to find better solutions. *Be* their better  <br/>\nsolutions.

Why? Because  <br/>\n&gt; staying where<br/>\n&gt; they can continue to bother you may result in you or them getting  <br/>\n&gt; hurt or you<br/>\n&gt; getting angry and yelling or hitting them, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s way too much explanation.

However, I rarely expect my kids to understand, accept, or <br/>\nobey (in fact, I cringe at obey), though there are times that I&#39;m certain I&#39;ve <br/>\nflubbed up in this area. I work very hard to model the types of values that I <br/>\nwould like my children to value as well as talk about what, how, and why X is <br/>\nusually better than Y in various situations (i.e. moving away from someone who <br/>\nis bothering you (and not listening to your requests to stop) is usually better <br/>\nthan staying where they can continue to bother you. Why? Because staying where <br/>\nthey can continue to bother you may result in you or them getting hurt or you <br/>\ngetting angry and yelling or hitting them, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\n I would not expect my 1 year olds to understand this at all right now let alone <br/>\naccept it or obey . I do think that my 4 year old is able to understand it <br/>\n(after talking about it and doing it), but she is not expected to accept it (she <br/>\nmay think the space she is in is worth staying in or defending) or obeying (she <br/>\ntells me no, and I accept that, though I may not always like it ;-)).   I have <br/>\nalso modeled this principle (or versions of it) in various ways (moving if one <br/>\nof my kids is being/playing too roughly with me, moving my car on the road if <br/>\nanother car is driving erratically, moving my kids out of the way if someone is <br/>\nwalking toward them and not watching for them, etc.). Interestingly, it is not <br/>\nuntil writing this that I realized that this is a principle that I have, <br/>\nsomething I value. This is what I want to get better at: seeing such principles. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Principles are what you use to help *you* decide between better and <br/>\nnot so good. Principles are what you use to create the atmosphere you <br/>\nvalue in  your home&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOk.  I understand this as a definition, and I would understand it better for <br/>\napplication with some real world *these are my/our principles* discussion. So, <br/>\nwhat do other people consider their principles (for themselves, in their <br/>\nhouseholds, etc)? Principles seemed to me to be things like: be kind, be safe, <br/>\nrespect others, UNTIL I read Sandra&#39;s Big Book and Sandra&#39;s site, and some of <br/>\nthe ideas that she calls principles make so much sense to me, but I don&#39;t seem <br/>\nto be very often coming up with or recognizing such as principles myself.  <br/>\nSandra&#39;s principles are clear and not abstract concepts. I don&#39;t have the book <br/>\non me now, but one such principle is something along the lines of *children will <br/>\nbe and feel safe in our home*. I see this as another way, a more concrete way, <br/>\nfor saying the principles safety, respect, kindness.

If *your* personal, guiding principle in a situation is &quot;do no harm&quot; then look for ways to make decisions and solve problems that aren&#39;t harmful (personally I find a &quot;positive&quot; works better than a &quot;negative&quot; - its easier for me to know how to be kind than &quot;not harming&quot;). <br/>\n<br/>\nChildren will catch on to your principles if they have reason to value them. If they live in an environment that feels kind to *them* - each one of them, personally - they have reasons to value kindness. And when they are able, they&#39;ll extend that to other people, too. So there&#39;s *another* catch - if your child is tired or hungry or out-of-sorts in some way, it won&#39;t much matter how much he or she values kindness, s/he won&#39;t have any to spare for other people. Adults do that too. If your grumpy, how much harder is it to be kind?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I have been experimenting <br/>\n&gt; with other ways of saying &quot;respect each other&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Respect can mean so many things, some of which overlap and even contradict each other, that it can be clunky as a principle. And it isn&#39;t reasonable to expect young children to extend respect to anyone who hasn&#39;t earned it - most of the time they don&#39;t have that much empathy. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re trying to explain your principles to your kids, nevermind that - I mean stop trying to explain! The idea isn&#39;t to replace &quot;no&quot; with wordy explanations of why not, but to help your kids find other, better solutions - hopefully proactively so they don&#39;t notice a solution was ever necessary. If they&#39;re having trouble getting along, they need your company and awareness and creativity, not your explanations. You respect *them* better by being aware of their unique needs - some of which are developmental. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I don&#39;t think one or two word principles are really any better if they <br/>\n&gt; are too abstract. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Your principles only need to be meaningful and make sense to you. If *you* know what you mean, you can use that as a starting point for making choices. I find kindness helpful as a principle because it&#39;s a good starting point for making decsions - it is kind to be helpful, to be proactive, to remember to take care of myself, to try to see the perspective of others. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever told my kids any of that - and yet much of the time they&#39;re pretty kind. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Principles","postDate":"1301413379","msgId":60454,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhFQTJBNDVCLTQ5QzItNDFDMS05NkFCLTQzN0VCNTQwNkZEOEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDkyNDcyNy45NjgxMS5xbUB3ZWI4MzUwMS5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDkyNDcyNy45NjgxMS5xbUB3ZWI4MzUwMS5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":60451,"nextInTopic":60456,"prevInTime":60453,"nextInTime":60455,"topicId":60448,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I read the other day the principle, &quot;do no harm to yourself or <br/>\nothers&quot;, and I decided that I like that so much better than a number of the <br/>\nprinciples I have now. Plus, with young children, I find that the more specific <br/>\nthe principle, the easier it is for them to grasp. My 4 year old, Rowan, <br/>\nunderstands what it means to be kind to her brother or to be safe while climbing <br/>\nthe couch, but she is not yet comprehending &quot;respect&quot;. I have been experimenting <br/>\nwith other ways of saying &quot;respect each other&quot;, and it just seems so wordy; <br/>\nhowever, I don&#39;t think one or two word principles are really any better if they <br/>\nare too abstract.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to read what other families have for principles.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Lisa Biesemeyer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60402,"nextTopicId":7969}}
