If <br/>\nI start to raise my voice now, I usually catch myself and start <br/>\ntalking quieter, or just stop altogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe steps to mindful parenting are something I discussed with Sandra <br/>\nin our talk at the conference. It&#39;s different for everyone, but <br/>\nuntil I accepted the philosophies of unschooling wholeheartedly, <br/>\nuntil I saw children as whole and perfect and doing the very best <br/>\nthey can at every moment, the gentleness couldn&#39;t take hold.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way to peace is just to BE peaceful..it&#39;s that simple. There is <br/>\nno remedy, there is no exact science to it, you just act peacefully <br/>\nand you will begin to feel peace.
