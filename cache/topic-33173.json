She <br/>\nkept saying that she wanted to learn to read, and I kept looking for ways to support her in <br/>\ndoing that, but it was clear that she really wasn&#39;t ready until now--she just didn&#39;t want to <br/>\nbe embarrassed in front of the neighbor kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I&#39;ve been through two reading on their own it baffles me that teachers still think <br/>\nthat they &quot;teach&quot; reading.  Don&#39;t they have eyes!!??  The same process of the lightbulb <br/>\ngoing off must happen for every kid that becomes an independent reader (vs. the kids that <br/>\njust shut down).  They must know how little they really have to do with it--or do they <br/>\nreally think that without all the &quot;pre-reading drills and skills&quot; kids wouldn&#39;t ever get there <br/>\non their own?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son did go to a bit of school, but my daughter didn&#39;t, so her process of growing was <br/>\nalmost, for me, like waiting for that rich batch of brownies to come out of the oven and <br/>\ncool down enough to eat!  I was so excited to watch it play out for her--and it happened <br/>\njust like all the other unschooling mamas said it would!!  Which has helped me to really <br/>\n&quot;know&quot;--deep down rather than in my head--where the right path goes and how to <br/>\nfollow it.  It&#39;s like that feeling when you are driving and getting that feeling like you are <br/>\nsure intellectually that you&#39;re on the right road, but there haven&#39;t been any signs in a while <br/>\nso that doubt creeps in and then you see the sign or landmark and breathe a big sigh and <br/>\nsettle back feeling secure that you&#39;re headed the right way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s not even to say that I had any doubt, but reaffirmation can be a great feeling!  <br/>\nAnd I find myself wondering if the TCS people that really try to follow it to the letter get to <br/>\nhave that feeling.  Do they see their kids interacting in the world in ways that give them <br/>\nthe confidence that  they are on the right path?  From the example of the boy in the <br/>\nswimming toy that seemed entirely uninterested in interacting with an adult who was <br/>\ntrying to help resolve the situation I have to wonder.  (I realize that we don&#39;t actually know <br/>\nthat that mom was practicing TCS, but following the practice through seems like it could <br/>\neasily result in such a situation.)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny C","from":"&quot;Jenny C&quot; &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: What (if anything) should I be doing to help her read and write?","postDate":"1205866299","msgId":33198,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZycDJ2ciszMzJoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDJCNzc5RjU2LTE1QUEtNDExRC1BMzg3LTExMTdCNTJEOEIyM0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":33193,"nextInTopic":33201,"prevInTime":33197,"nextInTime":33199,"topicId":33173,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... will ... they ...

Be involved in real and meaningful <br/>\nways to your daughter, not just in readin writin and rithmetic.  <br/>\nThose are schoolish goals, and somehow have become your goals in your <br/>\nthinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling really works best when the goal is to create happy and <br/>\nstimulating environments that learning takes place.  Lest there be <br/>\nconfusion, that learning that is taking place doesn&#39;t have to be what <br/>\nlooks like school.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter went from not writing ANYthing until about 11 or 12, to <br/>\nwriting stories, poems, journals, and lots of them.  She types more <br/>\nthan she writes, yet her handwriting is decent enough to read.  Her <br/>\ngrammar is good, her spelling is awesome, and she uses punctuation <br/>\nand caps in appropriate places.  All this was learned without any <br/>\nformal lessons.  In order for it to happen &quot;I&quot; had to get rid of the <br/>\nnotion that it was more important than all the other cool stuff that <br/>\nshe was doing and learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nFocus your energy on what your children are into right now, what they <br/>\nlike right now and expand their worlds in those things.  If they like <br/>\ngames, play more games, if they like adventure walks, do more of <br/>\nthose.  If they like playing dress up, give them more outfits to <br/>\nexplore.  Young childhood is such a fleeting moment in life, why make <br/>\nit boring and dull by inflicting children with adult held notions of <br/>\nwhat is big and important for them to do and know.

For <br/>\nexample, we&#39;ve read all the Junie B Jones books and last night we <br/>\nread the first four chapters in Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe sometimes dictates stories to me, and sometimes even illustrates <br/>\nthem, but she doesn&#39;t like to do the actual writing herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe sometimes writes her &quot;own stuff&quot; ... for example, I&#39;ll find a <br/>\nletter that one of her dolls wrote to another. They may be about 3 <br/>\nsentences long. I can read most of it, but it is mostly phonetic <br/>\nspelling (ie, &quot;wr&quot; for &quot;were&quot;), no real punctuation, all caps, that <br/>\nkind of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my question is ... Should I be DOING more to help her in this <br/>\narea? I&#39;m concerned that, because I don&#39;t want to &quot;teach&quot; or &quot;do <br/>\nschool,&quot; I&#39;m instead doing nothing, which may not be good either.<br/>\n<br/>\nShould I just get out of the way and let things unfold more on their <br/>\nown, and not do anything else unless she asks? <br/>\n<br/>\nShould I ... encourage something? Initiate something? Suggest <br/>\nsomething? Play certain games with her? Give information and point <br/>\nout certain things?<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I&#39;m asking is, How much do I get involved, how do I KNOW <br/>\nhow much to get involved, and what kinds of <br/>\nactivities/games/conversations whatever might be helpful at this <br/>\npoint?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nJenny</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32514,"nextTopicId":33497}}
