There are families even now where dogs are mistreated with the idea that it will make them good guard dogs.  It doesn&#39;t.  Or that it will make them mean.  It does.  There are families in my part of the U.S. that breed pit bulls for fighting.  They don&#39;t mind that their kids are mean to the dogs.  They&#39;re mean to the dogs themselves.  And they don&#39;t expect the dog to live a long, peaceful, happy life.  They want to make some money off it while it lives.  Dog fights are illegal.  So the side effect of that, with children, is that the children witness and participate in meanness, and have knowledge of illegal activity that they better keep quiet.  That&#39;s not good parenting or good pet ownership.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had friends when I was 12 who had a German shepherd they kept chained up in the back yard.  The dog was sad and mean.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThose are very extreme, and compared to that, a cat that will get to live inside seems all peace and love.  But my point is that the principles are more important than the actions, and when the principles are clear, the actions are easy to decide.  It won&#39;t be &quot;do I do what the breeder recommended, or what some unschooler-online-strangers recommend&quot;?  It would be deciding what you want to model and encourage in your family, and doing the things that lead more toward that goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":479765186,"authorName":"m0n1ka05","from":"&quot;m0n1ka05&quot; &lt;mama.monika@...&gt;","profile":"m0n1ka05","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: kitten biting","postDate":"1327313243","msgId":65204,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpmamJncitwYzlsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDRGMUNEODFDLjEwMTA4MDVAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":65200,"nextInTopic":65206,"prevInTime":65203,"nextInTime":65205,"topicId":65165,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I can see that now Shelley.

Plus kittens scratches can cause cat scratch fever. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nSince you had both of those it’s probably kind of scary but for perspective, the CDC reports cases of Cat Scratch Disease at about 22,000 people per year.  In contrast about 500,000 people a year visit the emergency room due to bicycle accidents.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it’s not only cats can carry Pasturella Multocida but dogs and cattle and birds and adorable little bunny rabbits.&lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo about unschooling ideas even benefiting animals..<br/>\n<br/>\nIvan came to live with us after his people moved away and left him.  He was really unhappy and even though I have always lived with cats I had a hard time understanding what he liked and what he wanted.  He was declawed by some previous person he lived with but he would bite and draw blood.  He’d strike like a snake!  If you leaned down to pet him he’d jump up and bite your face.  He bloodied all of us multiple times.   But we kept being nice to him, tried really hard to pay attention to when he seemed happy and do more of whatever he was liking.  After about a year of trying very hard to do the things he liked he was noticeably nicer.  He started to like us, he started to give little warnings when he was getting cranky instead of just chomping.   He’s lived with us for two years now and he rarely bites and hasn’t drawn blood in a long time.  He’s still different from any cat I’ve ever lived with but we understand him now and he knows we’ll try hard not to piss him off.&lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we’ve learned about him is that he really doesn’t like change at all. He doesn’t like it if furniture gets moved  or the mop bucket comes out or something new comes into the house.  Grocery shopping day still makes him cranky.  So when he first got here we were the wrong people, this was the wrong house, wrong yard, wrong furniture, wrong everything and he was really unhappy.   Kindness helped.  He likes us now, likes to ride around on my shoulder while I do stuff, likes to help me brush my teeth&lt;g&gt; likes to keep me company while I’m washing dishes.  We really love him and want him to be happy.  And he’s cute.

Marty was nine and wanted a dog, so we got a little puppy that turned out to be an Australian cattle dog (we didn&#39;t know when we adopted her), and I arranged to get Marty and the dog into the puppy obedience class that had the best reputation in town.  She didn&#39;t usually deal with children, just adults, the teacher said.  I persuaded her to give Marty a chance, and that I would be there to take over the puppy if Marty couldn&#39;t do it, and to help him at home.  We went twice, but Marty disapproved of jerking the lead and saying &quot;NO&quot; as much as the teacher was sure was necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that dog learned, figured out, all kinds of things without any training at all.  We talked to her.  We expressed frustration if we didn&#39;t like what she was doing, and we were happily huggy-and-kissy when we were glad of what she did.  Within just a year or so, the side gate broke.  She could get out of the yard if she wanted to.   We took down the junk on the other side of the house (we had just lately moved in when she came to live with us) and so she could go all the way around the house, and did.  She occasionally went out of the yard, but we would say &quot;stay home&quot; and she liked the praise and attention she got by coming back home, and she &quot;got it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe would go on walks with some of us, and stop at streets and wait for the human to look both ways and talk about it, and then say &quot;okay&quot; or &quot;let&#39;s go,&quot; and then she would cross.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe she was just a genius who could understand English.  I don&#39;t think so, though.  I think we worked with the instincts and desires she already had to find her place within a group and to be helpful and proud of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo other unschoolers in the days I was writing about our thoughts about all that progress said, in separate discussions (not here) something about &quot;unschooling dogs now?&quot;  And clearly they thought it was wrong and bad.  And clearly I said, &quot;Yeah, we are.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe treat our cats differently since we&#39;ve had kids than we did when we were childless, too (Keith and I), and  I&#39;ve talked about that sometimes when I&#39;ve spoken about the unexpected benefits of unschooling.  We became nicer pet owners.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: kitten biting","postDate":"1327265150","msgId":65183,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMjcyNjUxNTAuNzc1NDcuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTA3Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMjcyNjQ1OTYuOTAxODIuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTA1Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGpmaG9saCtoZjlkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8amZocWwxK25hOTRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDwxMzI3MjY0NTk2LjkwMTgyLllhaG9vTWFpbE5lb0B3ZWI4MTUwNS5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":65182,"nextInTopic":65184,"prevInTime":65182,"nextInTime":65184,"topicId":65165,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"nd I had to separate. -=- OK I did not have too but it was mindful to the animal to do so.

Having the cat as an indoor cat gives her/him really no options away. I think Deb&#39;s idea of giving the cat a place it can have as a private space is a really good idea. I think it needs to be a place where your children can&#39;t get at the cat. Completely outside of their range of access. Also make sure you are with your children when they are with the cat. If those things are outside of your households ability, rehoming the cat may be something you might want to think seriously about. Neither the cat nor your children are going to learn, very quickly, how to be around each other. Giving them safe, and well supervised access to each other will make it easier for all of them to learn to feel safe and act appropriately with each other. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n From: m0n1ka05 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mama.monika@...\">mama.monika@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Sunday, 22 January 2012, 19:03<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: kitten biting<br/>\n <br/>\nI should have given examples.
