It&#39;s so easy to be<br/>\n&gt; a dog owner.  You<br/>\n&gt; feed it, train it, boss it around. It puts its head on<br/>\n&gt; your knee and<br/>\n&gt; gazes at you as if you were a Rembrandt painting.  It<br/>\n&gt; bounds indoors<br/>\n&gt; with enthusiasm when you call it.*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *Then, around age 13, your adoring little puppy turns<br/>\n&gt; into a big old<br/>\n&gt; cat.<br/>\n&gt; Oh, it&#39;s terribly obnoxious, but I think they MEAN well. (Which is always<br/>\none<br/>\n&gt; of the worst things you can say about somebody. You know they&#39;re $%#@$% up<br/>\n&gt; somewhere.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The point, at least, seems to be to try to understand a developmental<br/>\nchange,<br/>\n&gt; and that it&#39;s normal. The analogy is not wonderful...but it all could be<br/>\n&gt; worse. And as insulting as it is to teenagers, I think this person has<br/>\nsome bias<br/>\n&gt; against cats they should really look at.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kathryn<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
