My post is more about my own personal experiences and how I won&#39;t EVER make my kids feel the way I did when I was a teen.  Although I am close with my mom and we get along NOW, it wasn&#39;t always like that, and I really think the past did irreparable damage to the relationship.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I was 18, had been dating my bf for 2 years, was in my senior year of school,  was working 30 hours a week,  and had saved up my own money to go out and visit then bf/now dh in CA where he was newly stationed after bootcamp (USMC).  We made no secret to anyone that we planned to get married eventually.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I bought my own plane tickets- IN SECRET- because my mom would have tried to stop me even though I was legally an adult at this point and 3 months from graduating high school.  I figured after buying them, she wouldn&#39;t stop me.  So off I went to CA for a 10 day vacation with my mom&#39;s final words to me as I left &quot;If you get pregnant, I won&#39;t pay for the kind of wedding you want to have. You can go to City Hall and elope, and you won&#39;t stay here through graduation, either.&quot;  (Nevermind that I had gone to the dr with her knowledge a year previously and gotten on BC pills to be proactive and SMART.)  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  So my point...  I tried to be open with my parents and I tried to have a mature relationship with them since I was young, and especially when I hit teenage years.  I tried to prove to them that I was trustworthy and smart, but I still knew I needed to sneak about to do things I really wanted to that didn&#39;t meet with my mom&#39;s life plan for me- like buying plane tickets.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  My dad was very open with me and while he wouldn&#39;t have chosen the paths I did, he didn&#39;t threaten me with ultimatums or call me a bad person.  Me and my dad have a WONDERFUL relationship and always have.  My mom on the other hand went through my stuff, tried to find secrets I was keeping, and threatened to take back things she&#39;d offered me (like the wedding when it came time for that or my home and the ability to finish the last few months of school to graduation). <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I did graduate- didn&#39;t get pregnant on my 10 day trip- and I got married at the end of that July when I was 18 and flew the coop clear across the US.  I couldn&#39;t imagine dealing with being an adult, working, going to college, visiting with BF, and eventually planning a wedding, and knowing that &quot;as long as I lived under her roof&quot; I&#39;d still have to obey all of her rules, all of her insane ideas of what a proper child, proper woman, and proper future wife should be (think June Cleaver).  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Had she not been so oppressive in her &quot;this is how a girl acts&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m the mom and I know best&quot; song and dance, I&#39;d not have felt the need to run clear across the country so early. I&#39;d have gotten a lot more college done and I&#39;d have been a lot better financially when I did finally marry dh. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  If our kids are willing to come to us and let us in on their lives, their &quot;secrets&quot; and inner thoughts, and ask for our feelings on things, it&#39;s such a disservice to the relationship to shut them out or shut them down with a quick &quot;that&#39;s not smart&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.  And god forbid we put them in a position of having to sneak or making them feel Less because their plans aren&#39;t what we would do. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Tina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLayne Family Blog:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://threekeys.blogspot.com/\">http://threekeys.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

I wanted her first experience to be <br/>\npleasant and beautiful and memorable and all that.

They *could* sneak off and lie and <br/>\nfind dangerous places and forget condoms and all sorts of mean, nasty, <br/>\nugly stuff...<br/>\n<br/>\nOr I could be smarter than that:<br/>\n<br/>\nI make sure there are new condoms always available. I&#39;ve talked with <br/>\nCarly about birth control (that *totally* freaked her out the first <br/>\ntime!) and offered to take her to my OBGyn (her own mom finally did).<br/>\n<br/>\nThey can ask for &quot;alone time&quot;---and no one will disturb them. They&#39;re <br/>\nactually very discreet.<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron and I talk openly and frankly about sex. It&#39;s not always the <br/>\n*most* comfortable conversation! &lt;G&gt; But we both do our best! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it all boils down to how would *you* have liked to have been <br/>\ntreated?<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting.

We often have overnight guests and it<br/>\nmatters little to me if they are boys or girls. Often they are all camped<br/>\ntogether in the livingroom when I get up in the morning. Most of these are<br/>\njust friends who stayed too late and didn&#39;t want to drive home.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the girls are dating and have been or are in longer-term relationships.<br/>\nTheir values in regard to sex are different than mine. I do ask that they<br/>\nrespect my values in our home though. I have younger kids and it matters to<br/>\nme. We are very open about all of this and though I don&#39;t agree with their<br/>\nchoices, I certainly respect their choices and they in turn respect where<br/>\nI&#39;m coming from. If a boyfriend is staying over I ask that they not sleep<br/>\ntogether alone in their room. (if they&#39;re part of the group staying over,<br/>\nthen I certainly don&#39;t separate them). And it&#39;s not so much that this is a<br/>\n&#39;rule&#39;, but that we&#39;ve talked about that I am uncomfortable with that<br/>\nscenario and this is what we&#39;ve come up with as a family. It&#39;s not discussed<br/>\nin right vs wrong way, but as a difference in values. They have been happy<br/>\nto accommodate me in this area. When the boyfriend&#39;s sleep over, it&#39;s<br/>\nusually not about sex anyway, it&#39;s about hanging out or not driving home<br/>\nlate or an early morning event (and in the case of Lisa, a boyfriend that<br/>\nlives in Florida). Lisa goes to Florida to visit him as well and I know the<br/>\nrules are different in their house. I wouldn&#39;t dream of imposing my values<br/>\non their home.  I think it all comes down to lots of talking and sharing of<br/>\nperspectives.

Coming at life with black and white nos  doesn&#39;t seem to work out well for everyone involved - especially for the younger person. Discussing with your daughter how you really feel about the whole thing, your experiences when you were young, your regrets, how your parents handled things, what you learnt from that. Ask her how she feels, go on and on and just talk. Problem solving and lots of negotiating are more reasonable ways of working through issues rather than being in the mind of controller. Saying no isn&#39;t going to stop your daughter sleeping with her boyfriend and it will probably make her more likely to want to do it.

Megan has been unschooling since December of <br/>\n  this past year. She is my third child, oldest at home and has six <br/>\n  younger siblings. The other kids have been unschooling longer. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Once she left school she got her nurses aid certificate and a job. <br/>\n  It was her choice.  She recently got her drivers license. Our <br/>\n  relationship has improved on a daily basis. I am still learning and <br/>\n  saying yes more has felt great.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Her boyfriend is a nice enough boy. He is well spoken and gets along <br/>\n  with Megan well. They have been dating for four month. I am certain <br/>\n  they are sexually active and she is on birth control. He is <br/>\n  seventeen.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I guess I am questioning my immediate no. I am questioning why my <br/>\n  reaction was no. She asked. I said because sixteen year old girls do <br/>\n  not have their boyfriends spend the night. How lame is that. I know <br/>\n  my own issues are mixed up in my reaction. I left home with the <br/>\n  wrong boy at 15. I do not think she is leaving home, but would I be <br/>\n  comfortable if he was in her room? If he spends the night will I <br/>\n  feel like I want to police the situation. I hate being a cop. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Her and I have struggled a lot. When I said no today she was really <br/>\n  angry and yelled at me. Of course I was questioning my reaction, but <br/>\n  needed to consider it. She is at work now and my no is still what is <br/>\n  on the table. I needed to think more, but her and I did not address <br/>\n  it further. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I really need an unschooling perspective on this.

She is my third child, oldest at home and has six <br/>\nyounger siblings. The other kids have been unschooling longer. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce she left school she got her nurses aid certificate and a job. <br/>\nIt was her choice.  She recently got her drivers license. Our <br/>\nrelationship has improved on a daily basis. I am still learning and <br/>\nsaying yes more has felt great.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer boyfriend is a nice enough boy. He is well spoken and gets along <br/>\nwith Megan well. They have been dating for four month. I am certain <br/>\nthey are sexually active and she is on birth control. He is <br/>\nseventeen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I am questioning my immediate no. I am questioning why my <br/>\nreaction was no. She asked. I said because sixteen year old girls do <br/>\nnot have their boyfriends spend the night. How lame is that. I know <br/>\nmy own issues are mixed up in my reaction. I left home with the <br/>\nwrong boy at 15. I do not think she is leaving home, but would I be <br/>\ncomfortable if he was in her room? If he spends the night will I <br/>\nfeel like I want to police the situation. I hate being a cop. <br/>\n<br/>\nHer and I have struggled a lot. When I said no today she was really <br/>\nangry and yelled at me. Of course I was questioning my reaction, but <br/>\nneeded to consider it. She is at work now and my no is still what is <br/>\non the table. I needed to think more, but her and I did not address <br/>\nit further. <br/>\n<br/>\nI really need an unschooling perspective on this. I do not want to <br/>\nstruggle with this girl whom I love so much, but also do not want to <br/>\nfeel like my personal boundaries are crossed. <br/>\n<br/>\nLooking for input<br/>\n<br/>\nKathleen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] overnight","postDate":"1149539702","msgId":26032,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDODU2RjZBN0Y0MkQ0Ri1FRTQtNkZFQG1ibGstcjMyLnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGU2MXZvais0ZDU2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGU2MXZvais0ZDU2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":26031,"nextInTopic":26034,"prevInTime":26031,"nextInTime":26033,"topicId":26028,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
