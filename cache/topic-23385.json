I think my problem goes back to that ole evil phonics. &lt;g&gt; I *learned* to read at home, before I went to school. Then I started school a year early and not because I was necessarily extraordinarily smart, but because my Mom never went to Kindergarten and didn&#39;t know when I was supposed to start. And because we lived in Iran at the time. And because all of her friends who had kids around my age were going, so I went too. The school I went to was a company founded American school and was more like a co-op play group. (too bad they aren&#39;t all like that) When we got back to the states I was *ahead* so to speak in some ways of my peers but seriously lacking when it came to phonics. I couldn&#39;t wrap my mind around the phonics. It didn&#39;t make sense to me and I still don&#39;t get it. Most times I wait on judgment on a word/name until I hear someone say it. Even then I&#39;m hesitant since many people pronounce different<br/>\n words/names different ways.  <br/>\n <br/>\nTanya/Tonya<br/>\nSandra/Sondra<br/>\nDylan/Dyelan<br/>\nKristen/Kiersten<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce Fetteroll &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fetteroll@...\">fetteroll@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a Welsh baby name book with a pronunciation guide at the  <br/>\nbeginning but are the words they&#39;re using as examples pronounced the  <br/>\nsame in America?<br/>\n<br/>\nA as in hard or ham (I assume they mean either pronunciation since I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t pronounce those the same ;-)<br/>\nB      b<br/>\nC      k<br/>\nCH      as in Bach<br/>\nD      d<br/>\nDD      as &quot;th&quot; in them<br/>\nE      as the a in same or e in self.

My Mom got both for Jack and even though he isn&#39;t much of a reader (and I never thought he would touch books like these), he read both condensed editions and loved them both. He probably wouldn&#39;t have understood or liked the original versions at his age, but I think now he won&#39;t be as likely to pass them by later in life. And he probably won&#39;t be a put off by the language. Usually, I&#39;m not a fan of condensed versions of books. I don&#39;t like the &#39;cliff note&#39; take on any book, but that is just me.

Your child could  <br/>\nend up with steparents who were against homeschooling.   Don&#39;t  go that way.  <br/>\n  <br/>\nUnschooling is not worth the loss of a family,  and honestly, with the loss <br/>\nof <br/>\nthe family, unschooling is almost always  gone forever as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*********Speaking as a divorced unschooler, I can say that life offers you  a <br/>\nbig set of &quot;challenges&quot; when you decide to keep the children at home after a  <br/>\ndivorce.  Russ (former husband) didn&#39;t oppose the kids learning at home  (our <br/>\ndivorce came long after the kids were learning at home), but he also did  <br/>\neverything in his power to make things hard for me financially, making my  <br/>\nsituation extremely difficult.  Let&#39;s just say he got the family home  (which is big <br/>\nanywhere and HUGE here in So. CA), and I was paying child support  for a <br/>\nwhile.  That never made sense, but it added to the burden.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen you have a supportive husband the situation can be different.  An  <br/>\nacquaintance of mine is divorced and he totally financially supports his wife  and <br/>\ntwo young children so that the kids can remain at home to learn.   Needless to <br/>\nsay I told him I loved him!!  :-)<br/>\n <br/>\nOften husbands just need some time to get used to the idea.  Russ was  a <br/>\nmilitary man and didn&#39;t have the peer support that I did (thro LLLeague and my  <br/>\nun/homeschooling park group).  Gradually he read things I left in the  bathroom, <br/>\nor would listen to me when I would share things that I had read.   He saw how <br/>\nhappy we all were in our lifestyle.  Later he became my biggest  supporter.  <br/>\nI gave him material to &quot;brag&quot; about.  Maybe it wasn&#39;t  traditional, but since <br/>\nhe wasn&#39;t with the kids nearly as much as I was, it was  difficult for him to <br/>\nknow what the kids were learning and doing.  I also  asked him to help with <br/>\nsome projects that the kids wanted to do that were fun -  and things he liked.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe divorce was difficult enough, if Russ had been forcing the school  issue, <br/>\nI can&#39;t imagine the hell we would have to have lived through.  <br/>\n <br/>\nFlexibility is a difficult trait to exhibit when you are passionate  about an <br/>\nissue, but often if you can step back and approach with love and  peace in <br/>\nyour actions and heart, you won&#39;t need to make huge changes in your  ideas.  <br/>\nWhen I was young everything was black or white.
