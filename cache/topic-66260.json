We do now eat at a<br/>\nfast food restaurant occasionally (planned or on a whim), and we don&#39;t have<br/>\ndaily requests anymore.  It is fun to eat out and it feels exciting to the<br/>\nkids.  Another thing we&#39;ll do to satisfy eating out is to have a picnic or<br/>\nto stop at a grocery store&#39;s salad/fruit/olivebar/soup buffet.  The one we<br/>\ngo to has a nice, window-y spot to sit and eat.  It&#39;s always interesting to<br/>\nsee what each kid (6 and 3) will choose off of a buffet, and since it&#39;s a<br/>\npay by pound deal, it&#39;s about the cost of eating at a fast food joint...<br/>\nand it&#39;s still &quot;fast food.&quot;  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMisti<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, Mar 20, 2012 at 11:22 AM, Tress Miles &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:milesdt@...\">milesdt@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My question was rather cryptic, wasn&#39;t It?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was hoping that this group could help me think through my daughter&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; daily requests (no exaggeration) to eat at McDonald&#39;s, Burger King, Taco<br/>\n&gt; Bell, Wendy&#39;s and ChickFilA , the only fast food places in our area.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was concerned about the high levels of artificial chemicals in their<br/>\n&gt; foods (I&#39;ve read the ingredient lists), but then I started thinking about<br/>\n&gt; the groceries I buy.
