A gaming associate drove a long way once to meet my kids and a couple of our friends.  They were mid-to-late teens.  She was grown, in her 20s with a severely disabled daughter.   The game (a text-based role-playing game called AON) was the best part of her life, and she wanted to meet Kirby and Marty and a few others.  They were apprehensive.  *I* was apprehensive, because I thought if she could get Kirby to love her and go home with her, he could help her take care of her daughter.  A crazy jump in thinking, perhaps, but people have done crazier.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe brought them expensive gifts.  Shirts.  A guitar, for one of them (not my guys).  She seemed okay, though, and not predatory.  Just really happy to have a little vacation from taking care of her daughter who was (I think) 12, and entirely incapacitated.  She had all this motherly charge built up and let it out on this batch of teen boys, it seemed.  I never heard that she tried to &quot;do&quot; or get any of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother time, Marty was invited to meet someone at the mall, someone he had met online.  A girl. They were 14 or so.  He said he would meet her but he watned to bring a friend or two, and she said she did too.  The found each other, hung out a bit, were mutually unimpressed (not horribly so, just not the same kind of kids) and were polite and friendly.<br/>\n<br/>\nA WoW guild Kirby was in on decided to go to dinner one night, and turns out a couple of guys they had never met were actually locals, too.  So they showed up.  A gay couple.  And they all liked each other and had the whole guild thing in common.  One of the other guys in Kirby&#39;s group was gay too, so it wasn&#39;t as polarized as it might have been, which was a relief, and those guys went to a couple or more social gatherings afterward, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith corresponded with Viking-re-enactment people from Denver, and they met at a camp, where they already kind of knew each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nMANY unschoolers have friends of other ages.  They will NOT be meeting others just their age.   And because of common interests, the unschoolers will have opportunities and experiences they wouldn&#39;t have if they were in school.  So don&#39;t think of it as odd or weird that someone in his 20&#39;s would know and want to meet a younger person.  It&#39;s part of living in the real world.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Meeting online friends in person","postDate":"1297053024","msgId":59560,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRENEY3NTYwLjQwMzA2MDhAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGk9NzM0M0FRSGRqRHlDb3BMQkhMQzlRV2NOYUZyUzJyQTZyV2h2PUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGlpbmZtMCtwMXZoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8NzA3NTY4LjY2MzE1LnFtQHdlYjgxNTAyLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4JPDU2Njg5MC4xMDYzMS5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNS5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+IDxBQU5Ma1RpPTczNDNBUUhkakR5Q29wTEJITEM5UVdjTmFGclMyckE2cldodj1AbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":59558,"nextInTopic":59561,"prevInTime":59559,"nextInTime":59561,"topicId":59552,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Some<br/>\nare unschoolers that he met through the unschoolers gaming list,<br/>\nothers are people he met in various lobbies.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s one particular guy that he&#39;s been playing online with since<br/>\nChristmas, he&#39;s 25 y/o, has a 4 y/o kid and kind of took Draven under<br/>\nhis wing and taught Draven how to do a lot of stuff in the game.<br/>\nDraven mentioned to the guy that he lives in central, eastern, florida<br/>\n(that&#39;s as specific as I like him to get) and that guy just told him<br/>\nthat he&#39;s coming to Daytona (not too far from us) sometime within the<br/>\nnext few months to spend time with some family that lives here.<br/>\nDraven asked me if I&#39;d talk to him (through the headset) and if maybe<br/>\nwe could set up a lunch date when he&#39;s in town.  I did talk to him, he<br/>\nseems like a nice guy, spent a bit of the conversation assuring me<br/>\nhe&#39;s not a creepy guy and the rest of the conversation telling me how<br/>\ngreat Draven is.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn one hand, I think it would be great for Draven to meet an online<br/>\nfriend IRL.  I spent a ton of years playing text based RPG&#39;s online,<br/>\nand I thought it was the coolest thing ever when I had a chance to<br/>\nmeet one of my fellow players in person.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, this guy is much older than Draven and while I<br/>\nrealize they have games in common, it just seems a little strange that<br/>\na 25 y/o would want to meet up with a 10 y/o.  I am also pretty sure<br/>\nthat once I mention it to my partner she&#39;s going to freak a little<br/>\nbit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not really wanting to say no.  Draven is completely okay with it<br/>\nbeing a family event where the 3 of us meet up with him and his family<br/>\nat some restaurant and have lunch together.  I&#39;m not too worried about<br/>\nit not being safe (although there is that little voice in the back of<br/>\nmy head going &quot;are you OUT of your MIND!?!&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone else been in this situation?  How would you handle it?<br/>\n<br/>\nTina</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59483,"nextTopicId":59589}}
