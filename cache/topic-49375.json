I read<br/>\nlots about Maria Montessori and Rudolph Steiner when my children were young,<br/>\nbefore I began homeschooling/unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I took away from my reading was that Montessori and Steiner were trying<br/>\nto create rich, supportive environments for children that had been damaged<br/>\nby war (specifically low-income European children hurt by WWI).<br/>\n<br/>\nThey both viewed their &quot;schools&quot; as substitutes for the home environment and<br/>\ncommunity culture that had been destroyed by the war. They emphasized<br/>\nclosely observing children, providing opportunities for children to learn<br/>\nwhat they were interested in, not pressuring children to perform.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the years Montessori&#39;s and Steiner&#39;s ideas have become codified, others<br/>\nhave written books, created curriculum and learning materials - little<br/>\nindustries have grown up around their ideas, and often stray pretty far from<br/>\nthe original intent.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m wondering I&#39;m seeing that beginning with unschooling.
