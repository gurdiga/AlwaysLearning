We were eating out and <br/>\nthey were doing the games on the back of the menus, and Ashi asked how <br/>\nto spell something.  Lexie responded correctly.  It was a fairly easy <br/>\nword, but not one with normal spelling, and Lexie knew it.  I just kinda <br/>\nsmiled and went on reading the paper.
