It&#39;s a deep sense of discomfort <br/>\nthat occurs when what we believe to be true is challenged by <br/>\ncontradictory evidence.<br/>\n<br/>\nA child raised in the experience of having his or her needs readily <br/>\nand willingly met (even when that might be regarded by the majority <br/>\nas excessive dependence) will perceive the satisfaction of their <br/>\nneeds to be &#39;normal&#39;. When that child as an adult finds him or her <br/>\nself in a situation where their needs are not being met, there will <br/>\nbe a cognitive dissonance between how things are and how they &#39;should <br/>\nbe&#39;. This person will consequently be SELF-motivated from an <br/>\nunconscious level to return their conditions to &#39;normal&#39; and will <br/>\napply themselves to changing the situation accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nA child raised in the experience of having his or her needs denied <br/>\nwill perceive unsatisfied needs to be &#39;normal&#39;. When the child as an <br/>\nadult finds him or her self in a situation where their needs are not <br/>\nbeing met, there will be NO cognitive dissonance between how things <br/>\nare and how they &#39;should be&#39;. This person will consequently NOT be <br/>\nmotivated to return their conditions to &#39;normal&#39; - because they <br/>\nalready ARE &#39;normal&#39;. It&#39;s &#39;just the way things are&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, strange as it may seem to those who confuse parenting with child <br/>\nmanagement, the more you give children what they want, the more <br/>\ncapable they become at getting what they want in the world at large; <br/>\nthe less you give children what they want, the LESS capable they <br/>\nbecome at getting what they want in the world at large.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, as Deepak Chopra says, &quot;The possibility of stepping into a <br/>\nhigher plane is quite real for everyone. It requires no force or <br/>\neffort or sacrifice.
