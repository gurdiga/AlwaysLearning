If those people could have the pleasure of meeting them, they wouldn&#39;t be so stupid about making comments about how completely ordinary and non exceptional they are.  Even by &quot;ordinary&quot; standards, they stand out in a crowd!  The 2 times that I&#39;ve met each of them have been wonderful experiences.  I&#39;ve never met Kirby.  Even IF they turned out completely normal, as in, just like everybody else, wouldn&#39;t that suggest that you were successful in raising kids that weren&#39;t the misfits that everyone seems to think unschooling will turn them into?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt fascinates me that people who don&#39;t even have teenagers yet, hold homeschoolers and unschoolers up to some unrealistic idealized notion of what a teenager &quot;should&quot; be, as if schools create all these super fantastic teenagers out changing the world.  Sure those kids exist, but I don&#39;t see it having much to do with school.  It has way more to do with the way their parents helped them in life and empowered them.  There are parents of kids in school who can and do, do that.  It certainly is NOT the norm in any way whatsoever and I&#39;m confident in saying that based on my own experience of having been a teenager and knowing a lot of teenagers now, both schooled and unschooled. <br/>\n<br/>\n Some idiot commenting on one of those articles this week was suggesting that I needed to learn the word &quot;generalize&quot; since he thought I was doing that by making a statement about &quot;many teenagers&quot;.   It kind of bugged me and I considered responding, but I felt, at that point it would be feeding a troll, so I left it to stand there for all to see.  I know what I&#39;m talking about and I doubt very much that person had any dealings whatsoever with any teenagers, that seemed obvious to me.  It seemed to be the writings of a very young adult who felt righteous in the fact that he was not a teenager anymore.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re:","postDate":"1272212155","msgId":53395,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEUzQTlGRDBELTA1NDItNDg1Qy1COTYxLUNBNzlDREE5M0ZBREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwNTQyMC43NDc1Ni5xbUB3ZWIxMTM5MTAubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwNTQyMC43NDc1Ni5xbUB3ZWIxMTM5MTAubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":53393,"nextInTopic":53409,"prevInTime":53394,"nextInTime":53396,"topicId":53393,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Thank goodness I was reading the book and following comments on the list, because I think that perhaps if I hadn t, the bias of the program would have made","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1144299569\">-=-Thank goodness I was reading the book and following comments on the  <br/>\nlist, because I think that perhaps if I hadn&#39;t, the bias of the  <br/>\nprogram would have made it much easier for me to discount unschooling  <br/>\nas a viable option.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou had the book as a talisman against evil!<br/>\nGood. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThose who haven&#39;t met me can find it easy to suggest (or flat out  <br/>\ndeclare) that I&#39;m deluded and crazed.<br/>\nThose who have met my family would have to be lying mental  <br/>\ncontortionists without a drop of integrity to even think it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not arrogance.

I joined this list and some others, and last Saturday I received Sandra&#39;s book and started reading.  It was really odd that Monday morning my mom called me to tell me that there was going to be a segment on GMA about unschooling (she saw me reading the book).  I thought maybe she misunderstood (I mean, what a coincidence!) but sure enough, I set my DVR, and when I got home later in the day I watched it.  Thank goodness I was reading the book and following comments on the list, because I think that perhaps if I hadn&#39;t, the bias of the program would have made it much easier for me to discount unschooling as a viable option.  It has been a roller coaster week for me (and I&#39;m sure many others) because of the media coverage of unschooling.  It&#39;s hard enough to be a homeschooler at times, and this week seeing unschoolers portrayed so negatively has really caused me to think long and hard about<br/>\n the decision to unschool.  It is definitely not the easy road, but as I read these posts I am encouraged to continue reading and investigating and watching it unfold.  Thank you Joyce for your last post...it is so helpful for those of us who are newer to unschooling to hear the voices of those who have been living and writing about it for so long.  It means a ton.  <br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53274,"nextTopicId":53360}}
