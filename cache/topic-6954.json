I know some people think that I KNOW what I am doing at <br/>\nall times, and have no worry about the outcome.  This isn&#39;t true!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I have come to believe is that having the kids at home has advantages <br/>\n(So many - as we know), but they still are outside the &quot;normal&quot; culture, and <br/>\nthere are things that they won&#39;t have in their lives that we did because we <br/>\nattended school.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids were so surprised when they went to college and found out they <br/>\nweren&#39;t dumb.  I had told them they weren&#39;t, but somehow it doesn&#39;t count as <br/>\nmuch  when the person telling you is your parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t surprised when my two reader/writer kids did well, but now my <br/>\nathletic son seems to be getting all A&#39;s too.  And even more importantly is <br/>\nreally LEARNING while he is there.  It helps that he is older (29), and <br/>\ntotally focused the same way he does with his diving.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe son that is raking in the money as a journeyman for heating/air <br/>\nconditioning seems to have lots of responsibility at his job (being put in <br/>\ncharge of projects), so he too is a high functioning young adult (age 24).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn all this time I haven&#39;t had many brushes with the law.  Once long ago CA <br/>\ntried to crack down on homeschoolers, and they all banded together, so it <br/>\ncame out fine.  Last year my youngest son was picked up in a local truancy <br/>\nsweep (the people at the drop site were questioning that he wasn&#39;t able to <br/>\nfill out their form - (since he had just learned to read, and still isn&#39;t <br/>\nwriting much (now age 14) that didn&#39;t look good), but they hadn&#39;t checked the <br/>\nlocal rules that exempted homeschoolers from the truancy laws.  Trevor&#39;s Dad <br/>\nfound this information out after we recovered Trevor from the authorities.  <br/>\nThe experience seemed to shake me up much more than it did Trevor.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love being with people who believe that the choices that I&#39;ve made for the <br/>\nkids has been a wise one.  Sometimes that hasn&#39;t happened.  My Mom told me <br/>\nshe was glad I was writing a book about homeschooling, so she could read it, <br/>\nand maybe finally understand what I&#39;ve been doing.  I don&#39;t think this will <br/>\nhappen :-) - the understanding that is--<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving strong opinions and living your choices can leave you an open target.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s when the support of friends can really be wonderful.
