He also gave up and,  <br/>\nguess what, at 21, 18, and 15 - the kids hardly ever climb into bed  <br/>\nwith us anymore. When they do, it is just for notalgia&#39;s sake.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce they got old enough to feel comfortable off in their own room,  <br/>\nI&#39;d lay down with them in their room - oh, all three shared one room  <br/>\nfor many years. Sometimes one or more would get in with us, but I&#39;d  <br/>\nusually move them to their own bed in the middle of the night. Or  <br/>\nthey&#39;d come get in with us in the early morning. Sometimes my husband  <br/>\nwould go sleep in one of their beds - if he really needed a good  <br/>\nnight of uninterrupted sleep. All KINDS of combinations and  <br/>\npossibilities.  Maybe Bob would feel better just knowing that he&#39;s  <br/>\nnot the only dad not thrilled with the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack home in Iran, where my dh comes from, people usually all slept  <br/>\nin pads on the roof in the summer and in one warmed room in the  <br/>\nwinter. So my husband was used to the idea of families all sleeping  <br/>\nin the same place - but he is a light sleeper and sometimes the kids  <br/>\nwoke him up too much when we were in one bed. Sometimes they&#39;d sleep  <br/>\non the floor beside the bed - that was better. Then we had a daybed  <br/>\nin our room and a kid could sleep on that or one of us could move to  <br/>\nthat if our bed started to get too crowded.
