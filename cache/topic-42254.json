I adopted a Quitter<br/>\nattitude when I went to nursing school.  As in, I&#39;m here in school today<br/>\nbecause I choose to be here today.  Tomorrow I might choose to do something<br/>\ncompletely different with my life.  I didn&#39;t feel trapped into school due to<br/>\nfamily pressure, financial investment, or any other reason.  In a class of<br/>\n115 people, I think I was one of the few that actually felt able to quit, at<br/>\nany time for any reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was part of learning my way in the world (I was 22, 23 at the time--wow,<br/>\n20 years ago), and it kept nursing school pretty low-stress for me.  It<br/>\ndrove the school administration bonkers, though, because they had less<br/>\ncontrol over me.  They couldn&#39;t use expulsion as a potential punishment.<br/>\nThey threatened, twice, to kick me out.  I was called before the Board to<br/>\nanswer charges of insubordination...I forget the exact details.  I told them<br/>\nthat I thought the charges were silly, gave a quick rundown of my<br/>\ninterpretation of the situation in question, told them my lawyer would be in<br/>\ncontact with them the next day if they booted me, and left the boardroom.<br/>\nIt was a bluff since I didn&#39;t actually have a lawyer (though I could get<br/>\none).  I just thought they were bluffing, too. And they were, so it worked.<br/>\nThey did put me on probation of some kind...I remember signing a contract<br/>\nsaying I would be kicked out for tardiness and several other minor offenses,<br/>\nnone of which I ever committed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also ignored their grades.  Every 8 weeks we had a 1-on-1 evaluation<br/>\nsession with our lead instructor, and she gave us 2 grades: clinical and<br/>\ndidactic.  The grades were written on post-it notes and handed to us<br/>\nceremonially across the table.  I always crumpled mine and dropped it in the<br/>\ntrash without even glancing at it.  First couple times they were aghast, but<br/>\nthen got used to it.  When asked, I just told them that if I were flunking<br/>\nout, I think someone would tell me.  But since I was having fun and learning<br/>\nlots and my clinical patients loved me (I even got flowers from patients,<br/>\ntwice, as well as a few Thank You cards), my grades were probably fine and I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t really care how I compared to Suzie or Johnnie in their A-B-C-D-F<br/>\nhierarchy.  Some instructors thought this was hilarious (they were my<br/>\nfavorite folks, for obvious reasons) and others never did figure out how to<br/>\ntake it.  And one of the people who was most threatened by my Quitter<br/>\nattitude was the one who charged me with insubordination twice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt graduation, I discovered I had been on the Honor Roll straight through.<br/>\nAnd I had had fun.  And when I encountered the word Unschooling 15 years<br/>\nlater, it made a lot of sense to my School Rebel self. <br/>\n<br/>\n-=b.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBrad in Boulder, CO<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://holcombs.org\">http://holcombs.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":76178688,"authorName":"jenbgosh","from":"&quot;jenbgosh&quot; &lt;pcjen@...&gt;","profile":"jenbgosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Trying something without obligation to live there","postDate":"1235505343","msgId":42473,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdvMWpidis5N2xxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY1MThhOTM2MDkwMjIyMDgyMnc2ZWI2YjI4NGgxMTRkYzU3MDgzZTlmMGQzQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":42355,"nextInTopic":42479,"prevInTime":42472,"nextInTime":42474,"topicId":42254,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think you should call it quitting too.
