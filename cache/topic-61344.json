Yes, we are, also. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the most interesting of the Thiel fellows (to dd18 and I)is Dale Stephens, who just founded Uncollege. He left school in 6th grade and was unschooled. He recently dropped out of his freshman year at Hendrix College, dismayed by the lack of passion and curiosity in his fellow students. It&#39;s certainly not confined to Hendrix, though; he makes that clear. After winter break conversations with a friend from an Ivy League school who was also disappointed with the college experience, he began developing his idea. He now has followers from all over the world, as well as speaking engagements everywhere, and a book in progress. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been following Dale and Uncollege closely. His Facebook pages are Uncollege [education] and Uncollege [group]. We are currently enjoying reading all the links to articles questioning college and the very lively discussions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso:<br/>\n <br/>\ndalejstephens.com<br/>\n<br/>\nuncollege.org<br/>\n<br/>\nThe questioning, doubting, and negative comments to articles about Dale or Uncollege will be familiar to many unschoolers. It takes a certain kind of early adopter / think-outside-the-box mindset to question the value of going to college. Most unschoolers have probably heard those same arguments against *their* alternate path out of K-12; most probably will &quot;get&quot; the idea of Uncollege. <br/>\n<br/>\nPriscilla Sanstead<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- On Mon, 5/30/11, JustSayin &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mfcappella@...\">mfcappella@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: JustSayin &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mfcappella@...\">mfcappella@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Questioning College<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Monday, May 30, 2011, 4:43 PM<br/>\n   <br/>\n      <br/>\n      My DH and I were talking this morning about the failure of college to prepare people for jobs in the &quot;real world&quot;, and for the many irrelevant classes people are forced to endure (and pay for) just to get that piece of paper. <br/>\n<br/>\nLo and behold Yahoo runs an article today: <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110529/ap_on_re_us/us_anti_college_scholarship\">http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110529/ap_on_re_us/us_anti_college_scholarship</a><br/>\n<br/>\n--Melissa</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":283530155,"authorName":"JustSayin","from":"&quot;JustSayin&quot; &lt;mfcappella@...&gt;","profile":"mfcappella","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Questioning College","postDate":"1306791825","msgId":61344,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlzMTMyaCs1b2E4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":61346,"prevInTime":61343,"nextInTime":61345,"topicId":61344,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My DH and I were talking this morning about the failure of college to prepare people for jobs in the real world , and for the many irrelevant classes people","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-245501001\">My DH and I were talking this morning about the failure of college to prepare people for jobs in the &quot;real world&quot;, and for the many irrelevant classes people are forced to endure (and pay for) just to get that piece of paper. <br/>\n<br/>\nLo and behold Yahoo runs an article today: <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110529/ap_on_re_us/us_anti_college_scholarship\">http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110529/ap_on_re_us/us_anti_college_scholarship</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n--Melissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34585,"nextTopicId":61355}}
