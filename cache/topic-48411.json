They are very high quality as play dolls with <br/>\njointed wrists, and elbows as well as knees and ankles. The have <br/>\ninterchangeable wigs that go on with a peg rather than velcro, so they stay <br/>\non. There are more wigs available to facilitate hair cutting play. Plus they <br/>\nall have acrylic eyes so they have a nice level of realism. They are <br/>\ndesigned as young teens, rather than the adult body that is Barbie. They <br/>\nalso have individual codes for their website. The only negatives are limited <br/>\nrange of skin tones (so far) and it seems they all use the same face mold. <br/>\nHowever as teens they don&#39;t facilitate the fantasy play about &quot;the future <br/>\nwhen we are grown up&quot; in the same way that Barbies will.<br/>\n<br/>\nBratz (until recently Barbie&#39;s fastest growing competition) lost their court <br/>\ncase and are going off the shelves. Their replacement from MGA, Moxie Girlz, <br/>\nare some pretty dolls that read as younger than the Bratz original four. The <br/>\ndesigners seem to have taken some of the parental criticisms of Bratz visual <br/>\ndesigns to heart and made some much sweeter faced girls wearing more <br/>\nyouthful clothes. Their characters are very similar to the Bratz, and they <br/>\nare all artists. A lot of the peripheral accessories focus on creativity <br/>\n(it&#39;s all a bit too guided coloring in for my taste. YMMV.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a side-by-side comparison between Liv and Moxie, Liv won hands down <br/>\nbecause of the eyes, extreme poseability, hair, and quality of the fashions. <br/>\nSo that is what Jayn chose for her birthday gift from Grandpa. We still <br/>\nhaven&#39;t registered them at the website though, so I have nothing to report <br/>\nabout the quality of the site.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother doll that Jayn has been enjoying is a smaller fashion doll called <br/>\nJuku Girls - again very poseable and with acrylic eyes. They are similar in <br/>\nsize to Only Hearts Club, but all vinyl instead of cloth/vinyl. They have an <br/>\n&quot;anime/manga&quot; look to the eyes and funky fashions. They are older looking <br/>\nthan Only Hearts Club, but still teens.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Integrity Toys playline of fashion dolls, the Dynamite Girls are the <br/>\ndolls that feature most in our detective stories at home these days. They <br/>\nare very poseable and extremely high quality. The hands are removable for <br/>\ndressing (so are Liv&#39;s). The delicacy of the sculpts and the detail of the <br/>\npainting are wonderful too. The clothes are very trendy and cool - finely <br/>\nmade. No velcro here.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf all of the fashion sized dolls, Disney and Barbie are still the best ones <br/>\nfor dolls dressed up in Princess or fantasy outfits. Most of the others are <br/>\nwearing stylized takes on real fashions. The Tinkerbell line is one of <br/>\nDisney&#39;s new biggest seller for girls. One of the cool thing about the <br/>\nDisney princesses is the variation in the face molds.<br/>\n<br/>\nMGA appears to have stopped producing their line of fairy tale princess <br/>\ncharacters. Of the cheaper brands there is an Asian company called Chic (not <br/>\nsure if it is Hong Kong, China or Taiwan) that produce a nice quality line <br/>\nof Disney knock off princesses and fairies. They are not hollow, so they <br/>\naren&#39;t as flimsy, but the face paint is not as high quality. The feet are a <br/>\nbit small too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have about 350 Barbie and similar 11 1/2 inch fashion dolls including <br/>\ncollectibles. We also have several Tonner dolls (16-17&quot;) and are eagerly <br/>\nawaiting the arrival of Jayn&#39;s big birthday gift (the last expensive doll <br/>\nwe&#39;ll be able to buy for a while) Evangeline Ghastly - a BJD collectible.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the Barbie movies, we have them all and eagerly await each next one. <br/>\nMy personal favorites are &quot;Rapunzel&quot; and &quot;Princess and the Pauper&quot;. In the <br/>\nearly days they would have a star playing the villain. These included <br/>\nAnjelica Huston and Martin Short. Then they backed off from using a big <br/>\nname. I can&#39;t help wondering if the reason is that the scripts for the later <br/>\nmovies were less than stellar. However in the latest film, &quot;Three <br/>\nMusketeers&quot; the villain is voiced by Tim Curry. I don&#39;t know if this is a <br/>\nreturn to the old policy, or a sad commentary on the state of Tim Curry&#39;s <br/>\ncareer. They all have empowering themes about courage, honesty, living your <br/>\ndreams, kindness, creativity, standing up for the weaker.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things I love about Disney is the relentless pursuit of <br/>\nexcellence. So many ideas, sketches, trials, animated scenes, concepts for <br/>\nrides are tried, examined, tested and discarded before they finally settle <br/>\non a piece of art work, design, toy or story. The attention to detail is <br/>\nphenomenol. I see it as very similar to the comment made about the candy <br/>\nmakers.

Things I was scared to address.  It&#39;s easier to &quot;listen&quot; to other like minded people because when people unschool, they must be at least a little alike on some level!  I appreciate all of you for taking the time to help me sort out and think through some things that I should not have been doing or saying to my children.  <br/>\n<br/>\nToday I talked to my daughter about Barbie.  I&#39;ve told her that I didn&#39;t like Barbie and that I would buy her one.  Since this conversation about food was going on, I really started to think about that and wonder why I&#39;d ever started to have that opinion.  Was it based upon real true reasons or based upon something I once read or heard someone else say.  I decided that playing with Barbie when I was a child was NOT what made me end up acting out in certain ways and so I talked to my kid.  I asked her if she was interested in Barbie.  She said yes.  I said &quot;If mommy said that it was totally fine for you to ask for a Barbie for your birthday, would you feel good about that?&quot; She said yes.  So I told her she could ask for one and that would be fine.  She told me she wanted a Dora toy!  LOL.  But the point is that I felt really good about that and it was a step in the right direction of creating a loving and respectful relationship with my daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thank you all for helping me move in that direction.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48463,"nextTopicId":48486}}
