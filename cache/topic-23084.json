My daughter is &quot;bipolar&quot; too and is adopted.  I am sure that meeting her birthparents before she is an adult would be a big mistake for all of us.  If I adopted my (future) grandkids for your reasons, I would be very unwilling to let them go to a place I thought might be bad for them.  I think stability and a healthy home are the most important things to consider for your grandkids.  Maybe after several years, things might feel different, but for now, I probably would keep the kids with me and let my daughter decide where to spend her time.  But only you can decide what feels right to you. Good luck!<br/>\nMolly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  SPONSORED LINKS American family home insurance  American family home insurance company  American family home owner insurance  <br/>\n        Multi family home for sale  Single family home for sale  Family home finance  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  YAHOO!
