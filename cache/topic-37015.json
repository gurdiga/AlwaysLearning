It was always<br/>\nthe same cassette, or usually the same one.  There were 3 that she would<br/>\nfall asleep to, one was called Slumber Land, one was called Sidewalk<br/>\nStories, which had some lively parts so wasn&#39;t something that worked all<br/>\nthe time, and one was a tape by Penguin Cafe Orchestra, which worked<br/>\nbest for naps rather than night time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSleep patterns are so fleeting though.  It seems they change all the<br/>\ntime.  In my experience, once we establish some sort of sleep pattern,<br/>\nit changes because life changes.  Chamille was an awesome sleeper when<br/>\nshe was little, there was never any trouble with her falling asleep, now<br/>\nshe will stay up all night sometimes and sleep all day.  Margaux has<br/>\nalways been difficult with sleep, even as a tiny baby.  She never took<br/>\nnaps except for the occasional falling asleep while nursing, she almost<br/>\nnever fell asleep in the car, nor would she stay asleep if she was moved<br/>\neither out of my nursing arms or out of her car seat, etc.  She has<br/>\nalways gravitated to having her sleep pattern be what others in the<br/>\nhouse are, so if I stay up late, she will, if I go to bed early she will<br/>\ndo what is lively with the other members of our family.  Sleep seems to<br/>\nbe low on her priority, and she doesn&#39;t seem to need as much as most<br/>\nkids her age (6).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s something that we are ever trying to work with.  It can be hard to<br/>\nnever ever have a time when I or my husband are not on call as a parent,<br/>\nbut it is what it is, so we try to make it as fun and joyful as<br/>\npossible.  It would be great if Margaux would just go to sleep<br/>\nsometimes!  We try to have a bedtime routine, but sometimes that doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhappen until after midnight because to do it before that would be met<br/>\nwith conflict.  We use movies a LOT to help her fall asleep, because it<br/>\nallows her to stay awake as long as she wants, but in a sleep conducive<br/>\natmoshpere.  She will almost always watch the whole movie and want<br/>\nanother.

It&#39;s a<br/>\nCowon A2, similar to a video ipod but more functionality, and I convert all<br/>\nof his favorite TiVo recordings and DVD&#39;s to avi files and have it loaded up<br/>\nwith them.  It&#39;s awesome for car and plane rides (no hassling with discs,<br/>\n10+ hours of battery for video).  He&#39;s 3.5 y/o now, and we all cosleep, and<br/>\nat least a couple nights a week he takes it to bed with him.  There&#39;s a<br/>\nSleep Timer on it that I can set for 60 minutes, since he&#39;s usually asleep<br/>\nbefore that, and the device shuts itself off.  It takes a little time (30<br/>\nmins of elapsed converting time on the computer, not 30 mins of effort) to<br/>\nput a new show on the player, so we still have the occasional brand new TiVo<br/>\nrecording that&#39;s not yet on his player and he wants to stay up late to watch<br/>\nit, but that&#39;s pretty rare.  And when it happens, usually I&#39;ll just cuddle<br/>\nup on a chaise with him and watch it too, or have my laptop handy and do<br/>\nsomething else while he watches.  Recently he started preferring to use<br/>\nheadphones so the sound from the PMP in bed doesn&#39;t bother us at all (even<br/>\nwithout the headphones, he&#39;s happy with very low volume in a dark/quiet<br/>\nbedroom).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve never had an imposed bedtime in our house, trusting since his birth<br/>\nthat he&#39;ll simply sleep when he&#39;s sleepy.  Yes we have to nudge him<br/>\nsometimes when he&#39;s yawning and tired and a little cranky but wanting to do<br/>\nOne More Thing.  We just say we&#39;re tired and start moving toward<br/>\ntooth-brushing and other nightly routines, and he&#39;ll start gathering up his<br/>\nfavorite toys (and PMP, just in case) to take to bed with him.  Usually he<br/>\nwants to carry more toys to bed than his arms will hold, so asks us for help<br/>\nsince he doesn&#39;t want to make multiple trips down the hall.  So part of<br/>\npre-bed routine is me spreading out a towel on the living room floor for him<br/>\nto load the toys so I can make an easy-to-carry bundle.<br/>\n<br/>\nBedtimes also look different in our house Mon-Wed than the rest of the week,<br/>\nsince I&#39;m often out of town on those nights for business.  He and mom<br/>\nusually go to bed about 9pm (especially recently since she&#39;s 8 months<br/>\npregnant).  Thurs-Sun (and other nights if I&#39;m home) she goes to bed around<br/>\n9 or 10, but I&#39;m up until midnight or 1.  And he makes his own decision,<br/>\nwhich usually involves settling in with mom but then coming out a half hour<br/>\nlater to see if I&#39;m doing anything interesting, then back to bed with her.<br/>\nAnd sometimes he falls asleep in the office or living room with me, and<br/>\nother times stays up with me super-late.  When we have to get up super-early<br/>\nfor something, it usually involves a car ride so if he hasn&#39;t slept enough<br/>\nhe&#39;ll just nap in the car.  And if he slept less than 9 or 10 hours the<br/>\nnight before, he&#39;ll usually take a 2-hour nap mid-day.  We sometimes<br/>\nencourage a nap by settling him on the couch with a video and snack, but<br/>\nusually we just notice a sudden calm in the house and will find him asleep<br/>\non the floor in the hall or living room.  There&#39;s no drama about sleep in<br/>\nour house.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBrad in Boulder, CO<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://holcombs.org\">http://holcombs.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117369878,"authorName":"Kelli Traaseth","from":"Kelli Traaseth &lt;kellitraas@...&gt;","profile":"kellitraas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] games/World of Warcraft","postDate":"1218110125","msgId":37046,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY2MTg0MC40MzQxNi5xbUB3ZWI1MTEwNC5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDY3NDRDQ0U5Mzg3RDQ0NUI5QzE1RDUxRUUwMzQ1RTRDQGp1ZHlQQz4="},"prevInTopic":37045,"nextInTopic":37048,"prevInTime":37045,"nextInTime":37047,"topicId":37015,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***The boys in this house, now 14 and 17, spent about a year on World of Warcraft before they started to do other things...they still play it some, but they","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1498270966\">***The boys in this house, now 14 and 17, spent about a year on World of<br/>\nWarcraft before they started to do other things...they still play it<br/>\nsome, but they also now go out with their friends and bike ride and<br/>\nwatch movies and play rock band and all that stuff - but they really<br/>\nwere completely immersed for that long - just a head&#39;s up? ;-)****<br/>\n<br/>\nYes it is a very in depth game.  Lots of fun stuff to do and figure out :)   You and your kids may love it or you may not.  We&#39;ve had friends who have played and loved it and we&#39;ve also had some friends who just dabble in it a bit and then move onto something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur family still plays, mostly my son who is in a raiding guild, which means he gets together with his guild usually about 4 nights a week and does group instances.  Like what Sandra said Holly&#39;s boyfriend does.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to give a head&#39;s up to people who are interested in playing or checking it out.  Right now they&#39;re having a referral special,  I believe you can get a 10 day free trial, from someone who is already playing.  They have some nice bonuses for the beginner and for the person who did the referral.  Details are here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/index.xml\">https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/index.xml</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKelli~<br/>\n     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ourjoyfullife.blogspot.com/%c2%a0\">http://ourjoyfullife.blogspot.com/%c2%a0</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;There are no ordinary moments.&quot;   Dan Millman,  Peaceful Warrior<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":294640976,"authorName":"Rebecca","from":"&quot;Rebecca&quot; &lt;roteameise@...&gt;","profile":"quinnannalisesmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Sleeping (was Re: Crisis of Faith)","postDate":"1218090824","msgId":37045,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGc3ZTUwOCs5OXUxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE2NUE4QjlGLTFFMEQtNDVFQi1BMEI4LUM0QTgwQkQ0QTVCMEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":37041,"nextInTopic":37046,"prevInTime":37044,"nextInTime":37046,"topicId":37015,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

That seems dishonest to me,  <br/>\nespecially since I have read many of your posts telling others to  <br/>\nconsider their words before hitting send.  I guess it just changes my  <br/>\nview of you as *always* eloquent and certain of your words and lowers  <br/>\nyou to human status. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that you will discuss with me some of your original comments,  <br/>\nbecause I found them thought provoking.  You may bring this back to  <br/>\nthe list and quote me (within context, of course) if you choose.  I  <br/>\njust didn�t want to call you out on the word changes publicly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;<br/>\n &gt; People of any age can learn to listen to their bodies about hunger,<br/>\n &gt; thirst, needs for rest, etc.  But they can&#39;t listen if someone else<br/>\n &gt; is telling them whether they are or should be eating, drinking,<br/>\n &gt; sleeping, or not.  Learning to know ourselves is useful for other<br/>\n &gt; learning, but it is not in and of itself &quot;unschooling.&quot;<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; This isn&#39;t a simple subject, and it&#39;s one I&#39;m not personally clear<br/>\n &gt; on.  It&#39;s hard to explain how it ties in with unschooling.  I know<br/>\n &gt; how our kids have grown and how good they are now at getting up when<br/>\n &gt; they need to and sleeping when they need to (Holly got herself up<br/>\n &gt; this morning at 7:30 to take me to a dentist&#39;s appointment involving<br/>\n &gt; sedation--she drove and waited and brought me home).<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  (Sorry if this is out of order or I left something out here.  I had  <br/>\nstarted to cut and paste pieces of what you wrote, and I�m not sure  <br/>\nhow it goes back together.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; What&#39;s not clear is how and whether other families can or should move<br/>\n &gt; in that direction.  All of a sudden is not the way, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If a family was moving towards unschooling and had previously limited  <br/>\nor otherwise controlled food, would you suggest that they ease out of  <br/>\ncontrolling food rather than stop controlling all of a sudden?  Just  <br/>\ncurious. I don�t think it would necessarily be harmful to suddenly  <br/>\nstop the control or scheduling (of food or sleep or anything else) as  <br/>\nlong as the parents provided some guidance rather than left children  <br/>\nfloundering and confused.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And &quot;a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; rule&quot; that there can be no bedtime is the extreme opposite that there<br/>\n &gt; Must be a certain by-the-clock bedtime.  It&#39;s just replacing one rule<br/>\n &gt; with another rule instead of examining particular ideas and  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>exceptions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m having trouble understanding that first sentence, because it  <br/>\nseems to me that any bed*time* is a by-the-clock bedtime.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see tiredness as similar to hunger or thirst, therefore attempting  <br/>\nto control someone&#39;s sleep would be similar to attempting to control  <br/>\nsomeone&#39;s eating or drinking. That control doesn�t seem to fit with  <br/>\nthe unschooling philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI provide some guidance to Quinn regarding her food intake and  <br/>\nsleep.  I try to supply a variety of foods including proteins for her  <br/>\nthroughout the day. If she has been too busy playing to eat and  <br/>\nstarts getting cranky, I&#39;ll suggest that a snack might help her feel  <br/>\nbetter.  If we&#39;re planning to meet friends in the morning and it&#39;s  <br/>\ngetting late, I&#39;ll suggest going to sleep to be well rested for play  <br/>\nthe next day.  She is 3 years old and so far she&#39;s a fairly picky  <br/>\neater and a night owl. &lt;g&gt;  Thus far it has not worked out that Quinn  <br/>\nlikes sleep even though we have always co-slept and continue to  <br/>\nnurse.  She does take naps and goes to sleep at night as she gets  <br/>\ntired sometimes.  More often she seems to like play more than sleep.   <br/>\nShe often seems to will herself awake playing while her eyes are  <br/>\nalmost closing.  She stays up until the wee hours of the morning  <br/>\nfairly regularly even though we have some relaxed getting ready for  <br/>\nbed routines, make the house quiet, and turn the lights low or  <br/>\nsometimes play hard to burn off some energy.  I trust as she gets  <br/>\nolder she will be better able to recognize her body&#39;s cues.  Perhaps  <br/>\nshe will choose to be well nourished and rested and/or she might  <br/>\nchoose to delay sleeping or eating to enjoy a video game, a good  <br/>\nbook, a lover, or anything else she chooses.  The engaged trust and  <br/>\nrespect for her autonomy are how I see this fitting into  <br/>\nunschooling.  It�s the non-coercive/ consensual living/ attentive  <br/>\nparenting piece of the radical/whole life unschooling philosophy.   <br/>\nWould you agree?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your time, work, and dedication to unschooling.  I have  <br/>\nlearned and continue to learn so much from your list and website!   <br/>\nThey both have helped me move closer to being the parent I want to be.<br/>\n<br/>\n======================================================<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":248194505,"authorName":"Rod Thomas","from":"&quot;Rod Thomas&quot; &lt;rodneykathy@...&gt;","profile":"deebot12","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"games, was sleeping","postDate":"1218044660","msgId":37025,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDYwMWM4ZjdlYyQwZWFhOGQ2MCQwMzAwMDAwYUBTUEFNPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNBNTY0OTMyLTJDMDYtNEIxQS05RkE4LUFBQ0RDRDg1OUE4QUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":37016,"nextInTopic":37031,"prevInTime":37024,"nextInTime":37026,"topicId":37015,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We just traded in (@ gamestop) an xbox, ps2, controllers and lots of games in exchange for a new xbox 360.

Our house  <br/>\nwas very small, and he would be quiet because the others were sleeping.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people asked questions about the problems the were having with  <br/>\nbedtimes, I would tell those stories as possible options.  Years  <br/>\npassed, and it seemed to become &quot;part of unschooling.&quot;     I think of  <br/>\nit more as respect for children and a lack of arbitrary rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf sleep has a purpose, that should be the focus.  Safety, comfort  <br/>\nand rest, not control and schedules.  From La Leche Leagues&#39;s  <br/>\nrecommendation of letting childen sleep with parents, we had children  <br/>\nwho liked to sleep.  Sleeping was good, and fun, and desireable.   <br/>\nThey were never put in a room along and commanded to be quiet and sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for a family that has been doing that (&quot;go to sleep; it&#39;s 8:00&quot;),  <br/>\nit&#39;s worth them thinking about why and whether there are options.   <br/>\nAnd lately I hear more often of people saying things like &quot;I told my  <br/>\nkids we were unschooling and now there are no bedtimes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are principles at work here.  Children should feel safe and  <br/>\nmake choices.  Parents should do things for good and sensible  <br/>\nreasons, not for arbitrary or kneejerk reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf children are made to eat when they&#39;re not hungry, and forbidden to  <br/>\neat when they are hungry, that&#39;s either arbitrary or cruel.  Trying  <br/>\nto &quot;put children on a schedule&quot; with eating makes sense in a culture  <br/>\nin which meals are formal and there&#39;s no real way to get food between  <br/>\nmeals, or in a culture in which children are to learn they&#39;re small  <br/>\nand unimportant.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same thoughts can be put onto sleep.  There are situations in  <br/>\nwhich sleeping at certain times are necessary for safety (war zones,  <br/>\njungles, dormitories where several people share a room...)  but when  <br/>\nthere are locked houses with electric lights and safe things to do,  <br/>\nand when it&#39;s possible for a child to sleep safely and comfortably  <br/>\neven when the sun is up, then there might be other considerations.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople of any age can learn to listen to their bodies about hunger,  <br/>\nthirst, needs for rest, etc.  But they can&#39;t listen if someone else  <br/>\nis telling them whether they are or should be eating, drinking,  <br/>\nsleeping, or not.  Learning to know ourselves is useful for other  <br/>\nlearning, but it is not in and of itself &quot;unschooling.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t a simple subject, and it&#39;s one I&#39;m not personally clear  <br/>\non.  It&#39;s hard to explain how it ties in with unschooling.  I know  <br/>\nhow our kids have grown and how good they are now at getting up when  <br/>\nthey need to and sleeping when they need to (Holly got herself up  <br/>\nthis morning at 7:30 to take me to a dentist&#39;s appointment involving  <br/>\nsedation--she drove and waited and brought me home).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s not clear is how and whether other families can or should move  <br/>\nin that direction.  All of a sudden is not the way, though.  And &quot;a  <br/>\nrule&quot; that there can be no bedtime is the extreme opposite that there  <br/>\nMust be a certain by-the-clock bedtime.  It&#39;s just replacing one rule  <br/>\nwith another rule instead of examining particular ideas and exceptions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37019,"nextTopicId":37060}}
