The owner Delores, who also the chef and namesake of the<br/>\nrestaurant, was a grandmother and she LOVED kids. She even kept a<br/>\ncorner of the restaurant with a toy box and play area for kids who<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to sit at the table all the time, and they were free to<br/>\nwander back and forth to it any time.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my favorite place to eat in Portland was an upscale dining<br/>\nestablishment, built in an old victorian style house that had a play<br/>\narea upstairs. <br/>\nThe family diners were separate from the other diners, but with other<br/>\nfamilies...only about 4-5 tables up in that area. But you could get<br/>\nfine wines, gourmet food etc... while the kids played with brio and<br/>\ndolls and blocks...<br/>\nIt was awesome. Old Wives Tales was another Portland fave, with<br/>\nvegetarian fare, casual atmosphere and a brightly painted playroom<br/>\nright next to the dining area.<br/>\n<br/>\nI MISS those types of places...the South has yet to catch on about that.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23966,"nextTopicId":24056}}
