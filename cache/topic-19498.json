I&#39;m not sure if I agree, but<br/>\nI am trying to compare other genetically influenced<br/>\nconditions with alcoholism in my head to see how they<br/>\nmeasure up and what the difference is between them and<br/>\na communicable disease.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA disease is defined as a &quot;particular malady&quot;, and a<br/>\n&quot;condition of a living animal or plant body which<br/>\nimpairs normal functioning&quot; and &quot;an impairment of the<br/>\nnormal state of an organism that interrupts or<br/>\nmodifies its vital functions.&quot;  I cannot find any<br/>\nmention of communicability being a factor in what is<br/>\ndefined as a disease.  There are many genetically<br/>\ninfluenced impairments which are called diseases, and<br/>\ncertainly qualify as diseases based on the definitions<br/>\nI have been able to find.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere has long been a running debate however, about<br/>\nwhether alcoholism qualifies as a disease, and this<br/>\nmay be due in part, I think, to the fact that we<br/>\ncannot verify that it&#39;s genetically influenced,<br/>\nalthough we have good evidence to suggest that it is. <br/>\nThere is also the argument that alcohol impairs one&#39;s<br/>\nfunctioning all on it&#39;s own, and the dysfunctionality<br/>\nin the behavior of alcoholics is explained away as<br/>\nsolely cased by the physical effests of the alcohol,<br/>\nwhich is a gross oversimplification.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it qualifies as a disease, but the word<br/>\ndisorder could just as easily be applied.  Like anyone<br/>\nwho&#39;s family is predisposed to a genetic disorder,<br/>\nthose with alcoholism (or addiction for that matter)<br/>\nin the family are at risk for developing it<br/>\nthemselves, in my opinion.  I don&#39;t think that means<br/>\nit&#39;s an unavoidable boogeyman.  It&#39;s just something<br/>\nthat needs to be taken into account so that preventive<br/>\nmeasures can be taken, like not hanging with a social<br/>\ngroup where drinking is &quot;required&quot; or not getting<br/>\nyourself into a job or lifestyle where you are<br/>\nconstantly barraged by drinking or alcohol, not making<br/>\nalcohol too convenient for yourself, or being<br/>\nconscious of how/when and why you drink and adjusting<br/>\nthat before a problem develops if there is a negative<br/>\npattern there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s something I definately want to address with my<br/>\nkids, given the risk factors in their genetics, even<br/>\nthough they have never lived with any alcoholics.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19489,"nextTopicId":19494}}
