Its scary stepping away from the standard family <br/>\nparadigm. Its unnerving to Trust when all your background is <br/>\nscreaming &quot;just say NO!&quot; even when you can see the way to &quot;Yes.&quot; Its <br/>\nfrustrating to have to rethink and reframe and reexamine all the <br/>\ntime until it starts to feel natural. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce it does start to feel natural &quot;sticking with&quot; unschooling isn&#39;t <br/>\nlike being in love at all. Its like living with someone who is <br/>\nimportant to you. Standard parenting expects children to become less <br/>\nimportant to parents and vice versa. If you have a 3yr old you&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen getting some of those messages already - messages <br/>\nabout &quot;separation&quot; and all the &quot;personal time&quot; you&#39;ll &quot;get back&quot; <br/>\nonce your kid goes to preschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom that perspective, spending so much time together seems weird - <br/>\nlike a twenty year love affair. To &#39;get&#39; unschooling takes an <br/>\nentirely *different* perspective about people living together as <br/>\nfamilies. Its a perspective that you only get *after* you&#39;ve started <br/>\nunschooling - which is why starting can be sooooo scary. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things I found most helpful when I was just getting into <br/>\nunschooling was to hear the stories of people with kids just a <br/>\nlittle older than mine. It was exciting to read about teens, but <br/>\nstill really abstract b/c I wasn&#39;t living with a teen, I was living <br/>\nwith a 3yr old. Hearing the stories of people with 5 yr olds gave me <br/>\nthe &quot;courage&quot; to get over all the &quot;what ifs&quot; and &quot;yes, buts&quot; that <br/>\ncome up in the beginning. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":116488337,"authorName":"Gold Standard","from":"&quot;Gold Standard&quot; &lt;jacki@...&gt;","profile":"jackiknouse","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Don&#39;t know if I have the courage, but I&#39;m beginning to think I &quot;get it&quot;","postDate":"1156638424","msgId":26871,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHQUVLQkRQQUIuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDgwMDE2NDEzLTVFRDYtNEY3OC05MENFLUM3QUUxMDU1MjE1NUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":26870,"nextInTopic":26874,"prevInTime":26870,"nextInTime":26872,"topicId":26867,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
