At the time, I only had three kids that were 8 months, 3, and 6. It was assumed that the younger two would be close to me but it was not assumed that my oldest would want to sit with me or my husband too. My mother-in-law runs a very tight ship and when there were big get togethers she would usually tell people where to sit. It didn’t have to be anything fancy. She liked to tell people where to sit. When she was telling everyone where to sit, I would ask her to make sure that our 6 year old got to sit with me or my husband. Some people think that it wouldn’t/shouldn’t matter where a 6 year old sat. Having our 6 year old close to me or my husband helped tremendously because my mother in law had rules that stipulated that you had to ask to be excused from the table and couldn’t come back once you had been excused. Our then 6 year old could lean over and tell my husband or I what she needed and we could get it for her or help her phrase things so that they were more acceptable to grandma. <br/>\nIt was my mother in laws house so she did have authority to tell people where to sit. I could have chosen to not participate or I could have chosen to try to find ways to make things work. I tried to figure out ways to make things work and one of the things that I did was ask that my 6 year old be next to me or my husband. At big gatherings, the baby was either in my lap or in the high chair and I had my 3 year old on one side and my 6 year old on the other side. <br/>\nNow that I have four kids, I sit between the youngest two and my husband will try to sit between the oldest two depending on where we are. We tend to not go to restaurants unless it is a buffet or a drive through because big places with lots of noise tend to be too overwhelming for our 4 year old and 7 year old. <br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Mealtime issues","postDate":"1332460205","msgId":66345,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGprZ2RyZCs4a2Z1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDlCRUU0MEUxLTBDMzItNDE0Mi04MjIwLTgwQkNFNDlDOEY4NUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":66338,"nextInTopic":66375,"prevInTime":66344,"nextInTime":66346,"topicId":66315,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Coaching is good but it should be done with a good attitude. In the past, I have coached my kids about proper manners but it didn’t work because I had a bad attitude. I was coaching them to do things but my coaching was coming from a place within me where I was not happy about it. I was thinking things like, “Why should have I have to do this? Why can’t people accept the fact that my kids are little and imperfect?” Coaching was not successful for me until I lost my bad attitude and started approaching it as something positive. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Sitting at the table on a special occasion to eat, at the age of six or seven? I think so.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My 7 year old can sit and eat at the table without any problems unless there are other factors at play. For example, going to a big family gathering can be overwhelming for some kids. When my child gets overwhelmed, all of the coaching goes out the window. In those cases, it is important for me to stay close and run a lot of interference to help her be successful. The example that was given earlier was that of a child that got up and was running around during meal time at a family gathering. If the parent knows that the child has that tendency and there is no kids table, ask the host if you can arrange to sit next to your child.  Whenever we go anywhere to eat, my husband and I try to sit as close to the kids as possible so we can help them with whatever they need. If we see signs of boredom, we can talk to them or make suggestions as to quiet and fun things that can be done without disturbing others. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Mealtime issues","postDate":"1332441242","msgId":66335,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlCRUU0MEUxLTBDMzItNDE0Mi04MjIwLTgwQkNFNDlDOEY4NUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGprZm83dStrbXI2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGprZm83dStrbXI2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":66332,"nextInTopic":66337,"prevInTime":66334,"nextInTime":66336,"topicId":66315,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-They don t need years and years of preparation - you can wait until they re older and have more skills before taking them to places where they can t behave","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-581259201\">-=-They don&#39;t need years and years of preparation - you can wait until they&#39;re older and have more skills before taking them to places where they can&#39;t behave properly.

It came up in chat yesterday.  <br/>\nI mentioned that my older children (6 and 4) don&#39;t use cutlery except spoons for yoghurts, breakfast cereal, soup.  They tend to eat what could be considered finger foods (fries, fishfingers, eggy bread, carrot sticks, sandwiches).   I provide cutlery, but they don&#39;t use it.  <br/>\nEating in restaurants is difficult - partly because they get bored, partly because they&#39;re pretty restricted in what they like to eat.  Cafes are better, shorter meal times and snackier food.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the chat, I was thinking about mealtimes some more.  Freddie (6) prefers not to eat at the table.  I don&#39;t have a problem with thisat home, though from time to time I ask that we all sit together (maybe once a fortnight or so, if I&#39;ve made a Sunday roast).  We were at my in laws at the weekend, and he refused to come to the table.  It was a tricky situation - I couldn&#39;t get round the table to get out to the other room where he was sitting without getting 3 family members to stand up out of the way.  I spoke to him about it afterwards but it was so awkward.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m mindful of my responsibilities in preparing my children to be a part of the society they live in, but I&#39;m struggling to communicate that to Freddie especially.
