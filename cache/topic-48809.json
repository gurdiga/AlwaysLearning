I was not in a good mood for various reasons and suddenly i thought about this chapter and realized the next moment and the rest of the day could still be great, it only depended on me. And the rest of the day was just great, we played and laughed and played and laughed a lot (thanks again sandra for this book!).<br/>\n <br/>\nAbout proteins, I agree with you. <br/>\nAnd although it&#39;s important for me to be attentive to what i&#39;m offering, i would not link the meltdowns to the food. Especially when there are so many other reasons for the kid to feel bad. Focusing on the food seems pretty unfair to me (all the more if the mum tells the kid) if it leads the parent to ignore the difficulties the child go through. <br/>\n <br/>\nAbout peanut butter, it&#39;s funny here in France most parents would rather see their kids eat chocolate rather than peanut butter.

I do know what it&#39;s like to have a<br/>\nchild who wants to nurse all day and all night! At times I was at wits end.<br/>\nNobody I knew had advice I wanted to hear. Just say no. Cut him off. He&#39;s<br/>\ntoo old anyway. He needs to be eating more food. He&#39;s STILL nursing?! OMG!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I&#39;m not sure where I got the good advice, if someone told me or I read<br/>\nit somewhere, but what worked was for me to let go and say yes. I was all<br/>\nhung up about what he was &quot;supposed&quot; to be doing or not doing and how I was<br/>\n&quot;supposed&quot; to be weaning or encouraging more eating of food or snuggling<br/>\nwhile saying no or whatever. But it all felt like denying him what he really<br/>\nwanted and offering cheap substitutes. My very perceptive child (like yours)<br/>\nwould not fall for it! She senses you pulling back (and you&#39;ve done this<br/>\nbefore!) and that makes her want it more! (It&#39;s like TV and other things<br/>\nthat people restrict with their kids, telling them they can&#39;t have something<br/>\nthey really want makes them crave it and think about it all the time.) <br/>\n<br/>\nLet go of whatever you think she&#39;s supposed to be doing. She wants to nurse.<br/>\nSay yes. Don&#39;t count the times in a day. Do it for more than 3 days. I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink that was long enough to see results. What happened on Day 4?

I&#39;m not sure how<br/>\nlong it took, but I do know that eventually he only asked for it when he<br/>\nreally needed it. And I started to miss it! (After a WHILE.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDamon hung in there until he was almost 5; he was going strong until his 4th<br/>\nbirthday, then it tapered off after 4.5 (lots of activities around<br/>\nChristmastime and weird schedules I think played a part). I went through<br/>\ntough times at 18-20 mos and around 3 or 3.5, I think I was beginning again<br/>\nto think about what he &quot;should&quot; be doing instead of nursing, but according<br/>\nto whom?!

Perhaps Allie (11) is one of the rare ones you mentioned.  She had a favorite blanket that she carried around when she started crawling and walking.  I thought it was cute!  She still has that blanket and 12 others now.  They all have names and she calls them her girls.  Along with 2 favorite stuffed animals, they all sleep with her every night (and one or two watches tv with her during the day).  We laugh that there is hardly any room in the bed for me!  She likes me to sleep with her occasionally.  Sometimes she tells me to sleep in my own room.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nShe nursed until just before her 4th birthday.  Some of my family couldn&#39;t stop themselves from offering advice.  They told me I was setting her up to be a clingy dependent person.  They were truly bothered by her nursing even after she started use the bathroom rather than diapers.  When I was in a couple of mom&#39;s groups, I couldn&#39;t participate in the whining and venting about children resisting training to stop nursing, go on the bottle, go to a sippy cup, then a real cup, or going from diapers to pull-ups and then potty training that seemed to last forever.  I didn&#39;t know about attachment parenting at that point.  I just did what I felt was right and figured it must be right because our home was so much less stressful than those other mom&#39;s homes.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":324049237,"authorName":"Emily S","from":"&quot;Emily S&quot; &lt;saturnfire16@...&gt;","profile":"saturnfire16","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Not eating breakfast then having meltdowns","postDate":"1259608680","msgId":48833,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhmMTVwOCtoZnJ1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAzNDAwMWNhNzFhNSQyYTE4Yzc5MCQ2NDBhYTlhOUBHb256bz4="},"prevInTopic":48831,"nextInTopic":48834,"prevInTime":48832,"nextInTime":48834,"topicId":48809,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks Kim, I know what you are all saying is so right.

Nursing is <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; fulfilling a different need for both of your children. If you are thinking <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; of the 4yo as &quot;taking&quot; the nursing from &quot;the baby&quot; that might be coming <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; through to your 4yo and promoting her neediness. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOh no, I have never thought of it as &quot;taking&quot; from the baby or set it up as any kind of competition or anything. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Perhaps she herself has <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; noticed that she gets less nursing when she has eaten, and that is playing <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; in to her need to nurse and her avoidance of food.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShe actually has gotten to nurse more at times after eating.  Sometimes she will say she is hungry, but doesn&#39;t want anything we offer.  Then she wants to nurse and I say &quot;no, not for food.  If you&#39;re hungry, go eat, and then if you still need to nurse, I&#39;ll nurse you, but if you want to spend time together, let&#39;s find another way to do that.&quot;   Also, it&#39;s not an avoidance of food in general, just in the morning.  Which was fine until she started having these meltdowns every morning that don&#39;t seem to be related to anything else other than hunger.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; More power to you for tandem nursing. Jayn nursed until she was 8. I <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; remember her being quite clingy and having a lot of desire to nurse - more <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; than I would have expected when she was 3, 4 and even 5. By the time she was <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; 6 it was tapering off to morning and night. Her desire and need for the <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; comfort and connection of nursing varied.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I would encourage you not to compare your two kids, who are at very <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; different stages developmentally. Even though your 4 yo is so much older, <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; she might be in a needy stage and nursing might be more important to her <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; than you imagine. I know with Jayn her desire to nurse, her endless seeming <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; asking for nursing seemed to increase in direct proportion to my desire to <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; avoid it. The more I put her off, the more she asked. Plus she was able to <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; articulate how important nursing was to her very clearly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI hadn&#39;t thought of myself as comparing them- that&#39;s something I&#39;ll have to reflect on.  I only said it that way to give you an idea of the number of times a day she would like to nurse, but I guess I could have said the number rather than make that comparison.  Something to think about....  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe number is 12 by the way.  I tried the &quot;don&#39;t offer, don&#39;t refuse&quot; thing for 3 days and she nursed 12 times a day.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Oh, I wanted to add that we didn&#39;t have a &quot;nap time&quot;. Jayn would nap when <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; she was tired on her own schedule, and certainly by the time she was 4 her <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; naps were fast disappearing from her day, becoming the exception rather than <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; the rule. Tying nursing to nap time, if napping is becoming unnecessary for <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; her might be adding to the problem too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t have any kind of set nap time.  Usually at some point in the afternoon, I&#39;ll see that she&#39;s getting tired and we&#39;ll rest.  Sometimes that means an actual nap and sometimes it means laying down and nursing for a few minutes, then reading some books or watching a movie together.  She usually asks for this or sometimes I suggest it, but it&#39;s never forced or at any set time.  If we are out in the afternoon, she&#39;ll usually fall asleep in the car.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only reason I say &quot;nap time&quot; is because when I was nursing her totally on demand, she would nurse SO MUCH that I was getting really touched out between the two kids.  So, I thought having some kind of routine would help so she would know when to expect that she would be able to nurse.  Well, it hasn&#39;t worked out that way, because we don&#39;t have much of a routine to our days, and nap time isn&#39;t at a set time.  But I don&#39;t know what else to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that does create problems because she will say &quot;I&#39;m tired, I want a nap&quot; two hours after she woke up in the morning just so she can nurse.  So, I offer to help her fall asleep other ways (which she can do), but suddenly she&#39;s not sleepy any more.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have strict limits on her nursing.  I try to nurse her when I feel able, but at a minimum of morning, nap and night.  That&#39;s my attempt at a balance between on demand nursing and weaning her. Most days I nurse her more than that.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it probably seems like, why not just add a mid-morning nursing time into our day?  When I do that, she still asks to nurse an hour later and will melt down if I don&#39;t let her.  If I nurse her twice in the morning, she will melt down on the third request.  But this isn&#39;t such a big deal to her if she eats. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEmily  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n     <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   \t\t \t   \t\t  <br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nWindows 7 � 35� pour les �tudiants�!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.windows-7-pour-les-etudiants.com\">http://www.windows-7-pour-les-etudiants.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":337736493,"authorName":"Anne Mills","from":"Anne Mills &lt;anne-mills@...&gt;","profile":"aberruyermills","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Not eating breakfast then having meltdowns","postDate":"1259394308","msgId":48818,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFNOVDEwOC1XMTE5QzRBOTdEMjU5RDE3NDg1QTg3RTQ5OTBAcGh4LmdibD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDlCREQwMDE0RkVBQzQ2ODVBMzc0QjlBNUY0MTdFOUIzQFJvYnluUEM+","referencesHeader":"PGhlcHMzYitvZjJ0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiw8OUJERDAwMTRGRUFDNDY4NUEzNzRCOUE1RjQxN0U5QjNAUm9ieW5QQz4="},"prevInTopic":48817,"nextInTopic":48819,"prevInTime":48817,"nextInTime":48819,"topicId":48809,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I had the same period with nursing William then 4 and Julia 1 but, after receiving guidance from a friend, I realized how I was too harsh and wanted very much","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-256882565\">I had the same period with nursing William then 4 and Julia 1 but, after receiving guidance from a friend, I realized how I was too harsh and wanted very much to be fair to both of my little ones.I have descovered that 4 ad 5 and beyond is really small and I slowed down.

Even though your 4 yo is so much older, <br/>\n<br/>\nshe might be in a needy stage and nursing might be more important to her <br/>\n<br/>\nthan you imagine. I know with Jayn her desire to nurse, her endless seeming <br/>\n<br/>\nasking for nursing seemed to increase in direct proportion to my desire to <br/>\n<br/>\navoid it. The more I put her off, the more she asked. Plus she was able to <br/>\n<br/>\narticulate how important nursing was to her very clearly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally when she was about 5 I made myself a small list of things that I <br/>\n<br/>\nwanted to keep in the forefront of my thinking in my parenting. This <br/>\n<br/>\nincluded starting sentences with &quot;I can&quot; and &quot;I will&quot;, making the effort to <br/>\n<br/>\nbe cheerful when there was a spill (as my face was communicating more <br/>\n<br/>\nirritation than I actually felt), and to nurse whenever I was asked without <br/>\n<br/>\ndelays. I found that she would nurse for only a minute or two, not the long <br/>\n<br/>\nsessions that I was fearing. It was all about connection, and we certainly <br/>\n<br/>\nstarted our day with nursing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI finally had to rescue my nipples from her teeth when she was 8 and she was <br/>\n<br/>\nnot happy for a while. But what I had noticed was my own unwillingness to <br/>\n<br/>\ncuddle her since she immediately wanted to nurse whenever I put my arms <br/>\n<br/>\naround her. In weaning, I made a concious effort to hug her a lot more, and <br/>\n<br/>\nI explained how I had noticed my reluctance to cuddle her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn rarely wants to eat as soon as she gets up, unless she is the middle of <br/>\n<br/>\na growth spurt. The amount of food she eats in the course of a day varies <br/>\n<br/>\nhugely also. It always has. There are days when it looks like all she is <br/>\n<br/>\neating is little bits of candy - like little energy shots. Then she will end <br/>\n<br/>\nher day by asking for something high protein. On other days she eats protein <br/>\n<br/>\nwith every meal and snack, and will skip the other foods on her plate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like your dd is making a concious choice rather than grabbing the <br/>\n<br/>\neasiest thing. I would continue to offer a wide variety, but not make <br/>\n<br/>\nnegative comments about her choices, or try to sway her with science. I&#39;d <br/>\n<br/>\nprobably try to say yes more to nursing also.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I wanted to add that we didn&#39;t have a &quot;nap time&quot;. Jayn would nap when <br/>\n<br/>\nshe was tired on her own schedule, and certainly by the time she was 4 her <br/>\n<br/>\nnaps were fast disappearing from her day, becoming the exception rather than <br/>\n<br/>\nthe rule. Tying nursing to nap time, if napping is becoming unnecessary for <br/>\n<br/>\nher might be adding to the problem too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

She&#39;s never had a &quot;lovey&quot; like a blanket or stuffed animal that she was really attached to.  It seems like a lot of kids have those as kind of a substitute parent when their real parent makes them cry it out in their crib or sends them away to preschool.  I do know some attached kids with loveys, but not many.  Anyway, in my more frustrated moments of this nursing relationship, I have considered buying her a pacifier.  Most people are trying to get their 4 year olds to stop sucking the pacifier and here I&#39;m thinking about buying one.  I wonder if it would satisfy the sucking need, since there are times when it really seems like that&#39;s all she needs.  I will try to connect with her in other ways and she will say &quot;I DON&#39;T WANT TO SPEND TIME WITH YOU!  I WANT TO NURSE!&quot; and sometimes sucking on my finger (she won&#39;t suck her thumb) will satisfy her for a while.  Or maybe if she had a special stuffed animal, but I guess if she wanted that she would have gotten attached to one of her stuffed animals that she has.  Actually, just typing that, the idea made me really sad.  I don&#39;t want her to have a substitute me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra, were you thinking a lovey when you wrote that?

I only said it that way to give you an idea of the number of times a day she would like to nurse, but I guess I could have said the number rather than make that comparison.  Something to think about....  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe number is 12 by the way.  I tried the &quot;don&#39;t offer, don&#39;t refuse&quot; thing for 3 days and she nursed 12 times a day.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh, I wanted to add that we didn&#39;t have a &quot;nap time&quot;.

Usually at some point in the afternoon, I&#39;ll see that she&#39;s getting tired and we&#39;ll rest.  Sometimes that means an actual nap and sometimes it means laying down and nursing for a few minutes, then reading some books or watching a movie together.  She usually asks for this or sometimes I suggest it, but it&#39;s never forced or at any set time.  If we are out in the afternoon, she&#39;ll usually fall asleep in the car.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only reason I say &quot;nap time&quot; is because when I was nursing her totally on demand, she would nurse SO MUCH that I was getting really touched out between the two kids.  So, I thought having some kind of routine would help so she would know when to expect that she would be able to nurse.  Well, it hasn&#39;t worked out that way, because we don&#39;t have much of a routine to our days, and nap time isn&#39;t at a set time.  But I don&#39;t know what else to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that does create problems because she will say &quot;I&#39;m tired, I want a nap&quot; two hours after she woke up in the morning just so she can nurse.  So, I offer to help her fall asleep other ways (which she can do), but suddenly she&#39;s not sleepy any more.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have strict limits on her nursing.  I try to nurse her when I feel able, but at a minimum of morning, nap and night.  That&#39;s my attempt at a balance between on demand nursing and weaning her. Most days I nurse her more than that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know it probably seems like, why not just add a mid-morning nursing time into our day?  When I do that, she still asks to nurse an hour later and will melt down if I don&#39;t let her.  If I nurse her twice in the morning, she will melt down on the third request.

Jayn nursed until she was 8. I <br/>\nremember her being quite clingy and having a lot of desire to nurse - more <br/>\nthan I would have expected when she was 3, 4 and even 5. By the time she was <br/>\n6 it was tapering off to morning and night. Her desire and need for the <br/>\ncomfort and connection of nursing varied.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would encourage you not to compare your two kids, who are at very <br/>\ndifferent stages developmentally. Even though your 4 yo is so much older, <br/>\nshe might be in a needy stage and nursing might be more important to her <br/>\nthan you imagine. I know with Jayn her desire to nurse, her endless seeming <br/>\nasking for nursing seemed to increase in direct proportion to my desire to <br/>\navoid it. The more I put her off, the more she asked. Plus she was able to <br/>\narticulate how important nursing was to her very clearly.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally when she was about 5 I made myself a small list of things that I <br/>\nwanted to keep in the forefront of my thinking in my parenting. This <br/>\nincluded starting sentences with &quot;I can&quot; and &quot;I will&quot;, making the effort to <br/>\nbe cheerful when there was a spill (as my face was communicating more <br/>\nirritation than I actually felt), and to nurse whenever I was asked without <br/>\ndelays. I found that she would nurse for only a minute or two, not the long <br/>\nsessions that I was fearing. It was all about connection, and we certainly <br/>\nstarted our day with nursing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI finally had to rescue my nipples from her teeth when she was 8 and she was <br/>\nnot happy for a while. But what I had noticed was my own unwillingness to <br/>\ncuddle her since she immediately wanted to nurse whenever I put my arms <br/>\naround her. In weaning, I made a concious effort to hug her a lot more, and <br/>\nI explained how I had noticed my reluctance to cuddle her.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn rarely wants to eat as soon as she gets up, unless she is the middle of <br/>\na growth spurt. The amount of food she eats in the course of a day varies <br/>\nhugely also. It always has. There are days when it looks like all she is <br/>\neating is little bits of candy - like little energy shots. Then she will end <br/>\nher day by asking for something high protein. On other days she eats protein <br/>\nwith every meal and snack, and will skip the other foods on her plate.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like your dd is making a concious choice rather than grabbing the <br/>\neasiest thing. I would continue to offer a wide variety, but not make <br/>\nnegative comments about her choices, or try to sway her with science. I&#39;d <br/>\nprobably try to say yes more to nursing also.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I wanted to add that we didn&#39;t have a &quot;nap time&quot;. Jayn would nap when <br/>\nshe was tired on her own schedule, and certainly by the time she was 4 her <br/>\nnaps were fast disappearing from her day, becoming the exception rather than <br/>\nthe rule. Tying nursing to nap time, if napping is becoming unnecessary for <br/>\nher might be adding to the problem too.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

She&#39;s never eaten breakfast right when she wakes up, which is fine, but the last few weeks it seems to be affecting her mood.  When I wake up, I usually make a smoothie or oatmeal or some other kind of hot cereal or pancakes or just put out some cut up fruit.  She used to like all of those things, so it was just a matter of leaving it on the table until she was ready to eat.  Now she turns down all of those things (except the fruit and sometimes the pancakes, but I don&#39;t make those very often).  So, I go ahead and make it for me and sometimes for my husband too, and I offer to find her something else to eat.  But she&#39;s not hungry when I&#39;m making my breakfast.  So, later in the morning I will offer again, but she will say she&#39;s not hungry.  But then she will want chocolate or icecream or something like that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll just explain what happened this morning, because it has been like this most mornings for the last few weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI ate some left over pumpkin rolls from Thanksgiving for breakfast, and offered some to her, but she said she didn&#39;t like them.  She wanted to play a computer game, so while she was playing I cut up some apples and bananas and put them in a bowl on the desk just in case she got hungry.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen she asked for chocolate, and I said while I was getting it out, &quot;Sure, just remember that chocolate has a lot of sugar, and you might have more energy for your day if you get some protein.  Can I help you find something to eat with it that would have some protein?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe said, &quot;these chocolates have protein because they have peanut butter.&quot;  I thought that was pretty cool that she remembered that I had told her about peanut butter having protein.  So, she didn&#39;t want me to find her anything else to eat and she ate the chocolate.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe wanted to nurse, and I said &quot;wait till nap time.&quot;  This is a daily struggle, because she wants to nurse a lot more than I am willing to nurse her.  I&#39;m tandem nursing her and her 16 month old sister, and she will nurse more than the baby if I let her.  So, I nurse her in the morning, at nap time and bed time and then some times at other times if she really seems to need the connection or she gets hurt or something. But every morning, she asks to nurse, and then melts down when I say no.  I hold her and comfort her and she calms down and then goes and plays, but the daily meltdown over nursing is getting old.  Which might be a different issue, but she doesn&#39;t get so upset about nursing (or want to nurse as much) if she&#39;s eaten.    <br/>\n<br/>\nThen at noon, she still hadn&#39;t eaten anything else, and I started making lunch.  She started drawing on some of her sister&#39;s paper and her sister wanted it back.  When I gave it back to her sister, she got really upset and went in her room crying and screaming.  I let her cool off while I finished making lunch and then I came and told her it was ready.  I held her for a while, and then she calmed down and went to the table.  She said she wasn&#39;t hungry, she just wanted to draw, so I moved the food over and let her draw.  I thought she might eat while she was drawing, but she said she didn&#39;t want what I had made.  So, I offered something else, but she said she wasn&#39;t hungry, she just wanted chocolate.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe had another meltdown later and I can&#39;t even remember now what triggered it.  But when I went in her room and held her, I said that I thought maybe she needed some protein for her body to feel better.  She said she the thing about the chocolate having protein again, and I said yes, but maybe it&#39;s not enough.  So, I offered to get her a bowl full of peanut butter and put some chocolate pieces in it.  She like that idea and she ate it. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince then she&#39;s had some apple.  I know that little ones sometimes don&#39;t eat much and that they will eat what they need over time.  I&#39;m not usually concerned about how much she is eating.  But it just seems like every morning she gets out of sorts because she really needs some food in her body, but she says she&#39;s not hungry.  But she always feels better and acts happier once she eats.  So, I don&#39;t know what to do.     <br/>\n<br/>\nWow, that turned out to be really long!  Any thoughts?  Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nEmily</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48842,"nextTopicId":48884}}
