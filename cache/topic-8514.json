The theory of the startle/adrenaline<br/>\n  rush attraction is that it is a &quot;safe&quot; thrill,<br/>\n  intellectually you know there is no danger and so<br/>\n  people enjoy the &quot;thrill&quot; of the biochemical reaction<br/>\n  to scary movies and the like.

Why does it upset me to be unsettled, off<br/>\n  balance, and nervy/jumpy, to feel that adrenal rush<br/>\n  tingling through my body and my heart pounding?  My<br/>\n  own theory has to do with my upbringing.  Having many<br/>\n  bad associations with adrenaline rushes early on (like<br/>\n  violence at or around me) and a great deal of stress<br/>\n  and childhood depression left me ill equipped to deal<br/>\n  with stressful situations in adulthood.  I feel that<br/>\n  it is a great handicap.  I don&#39;t like not being able<br/>\n  to handle stress and emotional situations without<br/>\n  being hard pressed to maintain some sort of composure.<br/>\n   I think it is important to protect children from too<br/>\n  much stress and fear.  The more secure and happy a<br/>\n  childhood, the stronger the adult.  We all know that a<br/>\n  baby left to cry is afraid, insecure, unsure of their<br/>\n  safety and caretaking.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t like to be scared.  In fact I hate to be<br/>\n  scared.
