He didn&#39;t think he was going to like it, and was afraid to write, but he&#39;s perked up and is having fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly takes math.  But holly writes on twitter, and sometimes (not often) her blog, and sometimes on Facebook.   <br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday Holly and I went to buy her a clip board, for a music group she&#39;s in, and a committee she&#39;s on.  We talked about the smaller clip boards, and I showed her the small &quot;legal pads&quot; that go on them.  Even full-size top-bound American tablets aren&#39;t &quot;legal pads,&quot; because our legal paper was 14&quot; long, and &quot;school paper&quot; and business paper, 11&quot; inches long.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose kinds of paper sizes affect the lengths of letters, sometimes, and school papers (&quot;write three pages on...&quot;).  But Holly writes with her phone, and with a computer, and for short bursts.  Here are two of her fairly-recent tweets:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Real Oldies 1600 AM is only in memories anymore. The harmonies will always play in my heart.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Fight the bite. Pink allergy meds and Benadryl cream.

Introduce a fourth<br/>\nbear or have only two bears and the story isn&#39;t different, it&#39;s<br/>\n&quot;wrong&quot;. Anybody can see that. It&#39;s Goldilocks and the Three Bears.<br/>\nThat&#39;s how the story goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the story of How Children Grow Up that many adults carry around in<br/>\ntheir heads, there can be expectations imposed on a child that<br/>\nlikewise come from no more than a belief that &quot;this is how the story<br/>\ngoes&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere might be a genuine sense of discomfort if a child is not<br/>\nsticking to the plot and that has to be addressed by the adult<br/>\nsomehow. Pushing the onus onto the child to conform to the &quot;norm&quot; is<br/>\nprobably the easiest way to &#39;make things right&#39;, even though the<br/>\n&quot;norm&quot; is an artificially established one.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstitutions like school tend to favour this kind of &#39;left brain&#39;<br/>\nthinking, unfortunately, but it&#39;s something that may well be<br/>\nunavoidable when dealing with large groups of people. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad it&#39;s not part of my life any more.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething else - I encountered this idea somewhere recently (maybe it<br/>\nwas here, I don&#39;t recall) and it makes a lot of sense. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s say there&#39;s such a thing as &quot;Everything you need to know about<br/>\n[insert subject here] to be a successful adult.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in theory, a child would have, say, 20 years to learn that<br/>\n&quot;everything&quot; before they reach adulthood.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the case of my unschooled son, it doesn&#39;t matter to me if he waits<br/>\nuntil he&#39;s nineteen and then learns &quot;everything he needs to know&quot; in<br/>\none year of focussed attention, as long as he knows what he needs to<br/>\nknow by the time he&#39;s an adult (although, in fact, he may choose not<br/>\nto learn it, there&#39;s always that option).<br/>\n<br/>\nWith child development drones and school teachers, the child is<br/>\nexpected to learn a specified amount of the &quot;everything&quot; each year.<br/>\nSo, by the time the child starts high school, he or she &#39;should&#39; have<br/>\nlearned, say, 50% of &quot;everything there is to know&quot;. If a child hasn&#39;t<br/>\nachieved that, then &quot;obviously&quot; there&#39;s something wrong with the<br/>\nchild. Not, of course, with the method of measuring progress.

I explained to her that writing, was just like any skill, it would improve if you want to work on it.  She did and it did. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe didn&#39;t spend a whole lot of time on it, just enough that she sped up a bit.  I&#39;m not sure why schools spend so much time worrying on hand writing?  I hardly write anymore and if I had a cool blackberry I would probably never write!:)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, since I came to Always learning when I was worried about Lydia going to school I thought I should mention that she&#39;s back home full time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe first went to our neighborhood school and hated it after the first quarter.  In less than one quarter she realized that the hoops you jump through are not worth the time put in.  At first she thought she was really behind but she quickly caught up and could do the work, but really didn&#39;t like the work they were assigning.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, she switched to the Montessori school where her bro goes for lunch and PE (:)).  She was there up until a few weeks ago.  She enjoyed this school quite a bit more, it was definitely more laid back and she has/d the greatest teacher.  But a few weeks ago she told me, that it was ok but that home was better.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s great to have her back!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was such a strange time having my kids at school.  I thought I would have some free time to myself but the reality was that I was just driving and we were prepping for school everyday.  With all the activities that the kids are in on top of it, it was a crazy life!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, one more thing about handwriting.  Lydia and Graham both take this art class with a teacher they love.  The teacher has these optional drawing lessons and my kids have been drawing crazy lately...both their handwriting has improved because of this...imo.  She has them draw the pictures upside down, said she likes them to pay attention to the lines.  ???<br/>\n<br/>\namy g<br/>\niowa</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Writing","postDate":"1236613887","msgId":43087,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZDQzExM0RCLTRBRTAtNENDMy1CQzY5LUU3NUI2RkUxOTM5N0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdvcnU5ZSs1aWFlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdvcnU5ZSs1aWFlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43077,"nextInTopic":43088,"prevInTime":43086,"nextInTime":43088,"topicId":43034,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-The last time was when he was 10 and he was in a play.

Sometimes we both sit down and just have fun writing letters, sometimes she pulls them out and enjoys just looking at the different ways to make letters, sometimes she will trace and write some letters.

I am sure that if he ever needed to learn to write clearly (and given his current passions I&#39;d say he won&#39;t actually run into that issue) he will just take a little time and get it figured out.

Chamille wouldn&#39;t do<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe instructors there kindly suggested that I take her to this free<br/>\nevaluation clinic.

Puzzles, video games,<br/>\nlegos, piano/keyboard (not lessons, just playing around on it), those are<br/>\nwhat come to my mind immediately but I&#39;m sure there&#39;s tons tons more, and<br/>\nmore helpful things that he&#39;d enjoy and you could tell your husband is<br/>\n&quot;groundwork&quot; for writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - just in case you haven&#39;t done this - you could take him to an office<br/>\nsupply place and research different pens with soft padding, different ways<br/>\nof writing (ink, gel), etc.  But actually I think I&#39;d wait on that until he<br/>\nwas starting to write more, unless he has complained about his tools in the<br/>\npast.<br/>\n<br/>\n-emiLy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 3/6/09 8:27 AM, &quot;wallyandwendy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wallyandwendy@...\">wallyandwendy@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hello All...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been lurking and learning for a few years now and hope you can offer some<br/>\n&gt; suggestions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; DS Ian, age 10, hates to write.
