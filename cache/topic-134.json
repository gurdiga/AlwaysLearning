I don&#39;t <br/>\nsee a problem.<br/>\nHave you looked at Calculus By and For Kids? It is great for a kid like this <br/>\n-- really interesting way of looking at calculus concepts -- meaty and <br/>\nsatisfying, imo. It does need someone else to fool around with it with the <br/>\nkid (and fool around is what you do - it is play) -- but if you or your <br/>\nhusband have enough background and interest, you could do that or, if not, <br/>\nyou could maybe find someone who does.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know that forcing kids to learn to read is possible at 3 years old. It is <br/>\npossible. But is it good for them? Do kids who are forced to read early turn <br/>\nout later to be smarter, more competent, better readers? Do they end up <br/>\nreading more or loving it more? NAH - educational researchers now have a TON <br/>\nof evidence to the contrary.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, what if you DO have a child who simply soaks it up and <br/>\ndemands to learn to read at a very early age? I guess some people might say <br/>\nwe should prevent them -- but HOW? Take the books away? Divert their eyes <br/>\nfrom print material? Dumb, right? So - I have one child who did this - truly <br/>\ntaught herself how to read before her 4th birthday. It is fine - at 14 she <br/>\nstill has some traits that make her unusual in the language/reading area. I <br/>\nsuspect that a kid who is DEMANDING and truly self-initiating advanced (and I <br/>\nconsider formal algebra to be advanced) mathematics at 11 years old will <br/>\nalways have some unusual traits in that area -- will be outstanding in some <br/>\nrelated way even as an adult. I don&#39;t see anything more dangerous in <br/>\nsupplying a kid like that with what he wants than supplying my child with <br/>\nbooks she could read, even though she was very young. <br/>\n<br/>\nBUT I would see that as REALLY different than trying to get my other children <br/>\nto read at 4 years old - even if I did it really nicely and with a fun <br/>\nreading program.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - word of warning -- I had a mom telling me over a period of months how <br/>\nher 10 yo son was like this - devouring math books -- she kept telling me how <br/>\nmuch he LOVED Saxon Math and so on..... but one day I HEARD him saying <br/>\nsomething like, &quot;PLEASE PLEASE can I just skip my math today and go to <br/>\nBobbie&#39;s house to play?&quot; Didn&#39;t sound like the kid had free choice in the <br/>\nmath department, to me. I started paying attention, and I noticed other <br/>\nthings where this mom acted like her son was initiating things but really it <br/>\nwas clearly her. I don&#39;t know if she believed it or was straight-out trying <br/>\nto mislead other people into thinking it. Or, who knows, maybe the kid liked <br/>\nit for a while, but the mom got overly excited and couldn&#39;t let it go when <br/>\nthe kid lost interest. <br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Otterspur@aol.com","from":"Otterspur@...","profile":"otterspur","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"XdbUZivrbDRKIamX7pSb4ciPSEY6x2eAE37PFjidaPGrisLH8F-cOdKLhLyqPjvJEyEmL7OKCxQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Math Too Soon?","postDate":"1007132306","msgId":134,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJiLjFmMjFjOWQyLjI5MzhmODkyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":140,"prevInTime":133,"nextInTime":135,"topicId":134,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oh, smokes.
