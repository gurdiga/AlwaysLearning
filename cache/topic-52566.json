Initially, I struggled with the issue of homeschooling vs unschooling with her, because I think she was taking me into unschooling from her own very felt need to deschool.  I was experiencing deschooling as if it were unschooling I think and this raised a lot of doubts for me.  I felt initially that I didn&#39;t have enough time or means to give Heidi a healthy education, but when I started to just look around at the richness she could explore just in our own home, I wondered what I had been worried about.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow though, I see that Heidi has lost the sort of fuzzy disconnected look she developed in school, and I feel that I got the daughter back that I recognized from our former homeschooling experiences.  As she&#39;s come out of that disengaged place from her own agency, she&#39;s begun to enact herself in multiple ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi had expressed some interest in sewing, and figured out on her own to start with developing hand sewing techniques, and has begun  her project basket.  We have developed a bit of a quiet lifestyle together but have managed to have really surprisingly serious talks about multiple topics as they arise.  I asked my class of college freshmen ow many of them talked to their parents about life issues, ideas, politics.  Virtually no one raised their hands.  I was shocked, and asked a few more questions, and a few said their parents talked about issues at work at the dinner table.  I wondered aloud if the whole scheduling thing of school, homework, buses, etc just precluded normal dialogue amongst family members.  I feel the more Heidi and I naturally talk through things, the more &quot;education&quot; she and I are both experiencing together.  There is no end goal to such dialogue, unlike in classrooms where the topic is typically oriented to a pre-set conclusion  In the more natural orientation that I see us experiencing the openness of possibilities always remain to be explored and revisited.  I think I under appreciated the role of dialogue in my previous homeschool days, and I wonder if the conversations we were having when we were done &quot;school&quot; weren&#39;t actually where education began.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi has been watching a lot of TV, but lately I&#39;ve started noticing her exploration of the many varieties of TV genre and less fascination with cartoons and pulp shows..  I started having her watching the same room I&#39;m working just for the conversation.  I started rethinking television as a medium for learning.  When it&#39;s not used as a means of frantic relaxation of to have a sense of something happening in one&#39;s life, it can be quite a window on the world.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure how much she is exploring on the computer beyond &quot;addicting games&quot; but I haven&#39;t been paying a whole lot of attention.  I wonder how this will change over time for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy other struggle was when others, especially my ex asked, &quot;What is she learning, what is your schedule with her, what&#39;s her curriculum?&quot; What&#39;s wanted is a thumbnail of what&#39;s being learned, and there is also something of a threat? I&#39;m not sure what that without such things negligence must be occurring.  But my answer now is, &quot;Why don&#39;t you ask Heidi what she is learning about these days?&quot; Which changes the emphasis from thumbnail curricular sketches to being in conversation with Heidi.  In a short time, adults get into an interesting conversation with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently I was reading about three cups of tea <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.threecupsoftea.com/\">http://www.threecupsoftea.com/</a> and how educating females can be beneficial to whole communities in third world countries and I wondered if traditional education as we have come to develop it in this country was a means of making resources available to multiple groups of people that were previously only available to a few; things like libraries, and time for conversation, and discussions about politics around newspaper articles.  But in a society such as ours where information is so readily available, and labor is not so all consuming and intense at home -- if in our modern setting, school then limits one&#39;s ability to learn because it is less of an enriched environment than most home in part because of the limiting of student&#39;s direction over their own education(and also less ecological and healthy to one&#39;s emotional well being, agency, and curiousity).
