Good relationships are hard enough in general to find, maintain, sustain. Relationships with requirements are even harder, because now there is a contract, obligation, requirement, condition. That would be next to impossible online especially. And not necessary. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut is it wrong to seek mutual respect and reciprocity in a relationship, even online? I ask this sincerely. In our home, love, peace and joy abound. Those who come into our lives are loved as Brother and Sister, no matter their perspective. For us, there are endearing terms that come with that; sometimes &quot;buddy,&quot; &quot;kiddo,&quot; &quot;love,&quot; &quot;friend&quot; are among those signs of affection. I feel that I need to ponder what you have said here, that those terms aren&#39;t as respectful. I can see how that may be so if one is unfamiliar with someone, but what about as or after a relationship develops? Can you expand on your thought more?<br/>\n_________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are buzzwords, sometimes, and slogans or assertations that aren’t as clear as the writer would like to have thought they were.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo go on in some detail and at length about the requirements and complaining (vaguely and obliquely) about others not having had the virtues now sought (being respectful) but then using terms like “buddy” instead of friend and “kiddo” instead of kid, or child, or player, or person seemed condescending to me.   I really don’t like it when someone addresses me as “sweetie” or “hon,” especially if it’s in writing from a stranger.  I don’t like it when adults refer to kids (not just theirs, but general kids, or theirs+mine, or whatever) as “smalls” or “littles” or “kidlets.”  It seems to set them far aside, as little toys, or inferior beings.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think in the original post, which was long, and seemed filled with sorting people into inferior undesireables and ideals probably not attainable (probably not the writer’s intention, but some of it came across that way), then the terms “buddy” and “kiddo” seemed to be the sorts of things that some others might not see as kind, respectful, accepting, whatever-all-lovely-and-good in tone or intent.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a general comment about how one person’s idea of respect might not match someone else’s.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":580929972,"authorName":"","from":"lbrumery@...","profile":"lbrumery","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Deschooling and relationships (was, still is, Re: Finding friends)","postDate":"1487548131","msgId":77884,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG84ZGF0MysxNDlzc3QyQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDkzMDY4RUNGLTQ2NTUtNDhDMC05RDFGLTMxRENCNEQwMTMxOEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBUHYrY1l3SGM2OGRlZmdMWTVXTnIwVGVaWWtIVktkV3Uxa20zWjZhaVZrY3JxVUh5d0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPEI2Q0JBN0EzLTFEQUEtNDQzNi04MDgwLTIzM0U1QjVFMjZGNUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPENBQ00tMVlYQ1hLSDdlcWVER2FYR1pqRzRQejdiRDdUc0RNa1czNTBDa2pfUDB2N2NiUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPENBUHYrY1l3aVdCc2dwdWtjMHplVU49ZnBDV0FZNXo0NDhocnp0Rng3QjQzUG9pcW0wd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPG84YWFjOSsxNDk4ZzE1QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4JPDkzMDY4RUNGLTQ2NTUtNDhDMC05RDFGLTMxRENCNEQwMTMxOEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":77883,"nextInTopic":77885,"prevInTime":77883,"nextInTime":77885,"topicId":77561,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Unschoolers are people.

The idea of “unschooling community” can be a problem you can avoid by seeing individual families and children as people.-=-</div><div><br></div><div>I don&#39;t think that your point is nitpicky at all. It is a good one: Unschoolers are people.&nbsp;<span style=\"word-spacing:normal;\">Agreed. I would go further and say that people in our lives are Brother, Sister. It is how we live our lives spiritually. But I can be clearer.</span></div><div><br></div><div>I brought up &quot;unschooling community&quot; as a more specific piece of my daughter&#39;s growing sense of community, which includes whomever we encounter. Among our friends and family are people from all walks of life with various forms of freedom, something that our daughter is still comprehending as something that she has more of (lives) than others. Some that we know are schooled conventionally, some are homeschooled more or less conventionally, some are cousins and so on.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We recently ended a 20-month-long full-time travel excursion across the country in our RV. It is during this time that her gaming life began to take off and flourish. Most of the people she met (of various ages and levels in life) during this trip lived a life scheduled, whether it be work or school or more. She became witness to the various levels of freedom that exist to pursue passions and play like we do and embrace in our lives. While in San Diego for four months, she became very good friends with kids ages six to 13. Most of them were off for summer break; thus, they were freer to play. Others were homeschooled, but didn&#39;t have the resources we did, which challenged her understanding of what folks are able to do to a certain degree (like being able to afford video games, headsets, new/er bikes, etc.), which can offer another form of freedom in terms of access.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Very recently we settled in California, for various reasons. One included that we physically and creatively were outgrowing our RV. Furthermore, consistent wifi was becoming a real issue for all of us: My writing, my husband&#39;s work and our daughter&#39;s increased gaming pulled heavily on our hotspot, and campground wifi was inconsistent. More space was required for more flow and freedom. It allowed us to expand. Now our daughter can play Minecraft and Roblox without interruption. Her gaming life has grown and she&#39;s having a blast and it is very exciting.</div><div><br></div><div>But the people she met along our journey and the cousins who game as well live on the East Coast and there is a three-hour time difference. Furthermore, they attend school. So, again, she is witness to how others live their lives, as well as how time/schedules are blocked or organized or limiting (literally), and that many of the people she knows online are available only after school and/or on weekends.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It was she who suggested that she would like more &quot;gaming friends.&quot; It created a dialogue about what it is she is trying to say and whether I am comprehending it, as well how I can help her, or whether I needed to help her. The conversation continued about various levels of freedom and what others are &quot;allowed&quot; to do, and that not everyone is &quot;allowed&quot; to play like she does. In an effort to help her expand her gaming experience, her community, I decided that a good place to start was with those who may have more flexibility, which I have found more often than not through those that are unschoolers. I don&#39;t assume generally that what we do and how we live is shared by everyone. However, by reaching out to those that are unschoolers, I felt that it was just one avenue to pursue in this relatively new -- and very robust and engaging and serious -- life of gaming she is living. Among the people I know who are unschoolers, there is a bigger awareness of freedom, gaming, play, and often more availability. It was a start.</div><div><br></div><div>But I understand your point and hear you. I can look more carefully for insight or help from people, not a generalized group who may share a name or experience.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>-=-“Buddy” and “kiddo” aren’t as respectful as other terms might be.

That would be next to impossible online especially. And not necessary.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>But is it wrong to seek mutual respect and reciprocity in a relationship, even online? I ask this sincerely. In our home, love, peace and joy abound. Those who come into our lives are loved as Brother and Sister, no matter their perspective. For us, there are endearing terms that come with that; sometimes &quot;buddy,&quot; &quot;kiddo,&quot; &quot;love,&quot; &quot;friend&quot; are among those signs of affection. I feel that I need to ponder what you have said here, that those terms aren&#39;t as respectful. I can see how that may be so if one is unfamiliar with someone, but what about as or after a relationship develops? Can you expand on your thought more?</div><div><br></div><div>-=-She’s seven.-=-</div><div><br></div><div>Yep, she is. My daughter, in fact, is seven.

It is a good point and I shall add it to my tools for understanding myself, particularly as unschooling parent. We&#39;ve had a few heavy experiences in the non-online world recently that have increased our protection bubble a bit, and have made our daughter yearn to be physically closer to us and aware of our presence more than usual.

She has had a few unpleasant experiences -- even in unschooling communities -- while gaming, and we are looking for a fun, healthy online community where kids can just play together and know that what they create is going to be respected. So, we are interested in kind, fun, creative new buddies if your kiddo would like to play online.&nbsp;<br><br>The conversation came up a few days ago when she said that she was really bummed when friends left games; she wants to get to know more gamers (and unschoolers, too) online (and to be able to use her mic and headset), and she is elated when they show up! This led to a lengthy discussion about how she felt about needing or wanting friends, which also dug up an insecurity that occasionally rises up in me, and that is whether she is lonely (read: needing more socializing).&nbsp;<br><br>So we talked about it. I asked her directly if she feels that she is lacking community generally in life, or if she just feels this way online. She responded very easily and quickly that she is really happy as long as she has me and her dad. In other words, any ideas I have had about whether or not she needed more people was mine, not hers -- and we are decidedly homebodies! This led to further discussion about her serious intentions of a gaming life, and that she really wants to build friendships that way. So that is what we are working on. <br><br>Our daughter has never been to school, but her friends include those who attend school and are more conventionally homeschooled. And although we have unschooling connections through Meetup and unschooling camps/gatherings, I feel that it still takes massaging and effort to find and continue to nurture relationships no matter what they are or with whom. I always go back to a couple of the connecting moments that bonded me to unschooling, and that is faith and the family relationship. Faith in the child, love for the family relationship, and that all will flow as it should when we sit back and let it happen. I was reminded AGAIN of this when I thought that my daughter was lonely or needing more friends. I am now officially over myself. :)<br><br>For the record, my daughter plays Minecraft and Roblox on Xbox. She would love to meet new people. Her name is Luna, and I am Liza. Hoping for your good flow. :)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":495438666,"authorName":"Sarah Thompson","from":"Sarah Thompson &lt;thompsonisland@...&gt;","profile":"wallacesmum","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Finding friends","postDate":"1487384362","msgId":77881,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBUHYrY1l6NEx3Nnp4MHYxVktxdEFfTG9leEJwX0xMLUdzelZSelI2aHQ1Ul8xelN5QUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDhEQTEwNTJDLTc3QzctNDJFMS05OEI3LTE2MTVGQUVFRkEzQkBnbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"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"},"prevInTopic":77880,"nextInTopic":77882,"prevInTime":77880,"nextInTime":77882,"topicId":77561,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We are happy to play!

Are you a member of the Yahoo group Unschooling Gamers? My younger son just turned 8 and he has made friends with a few kids from the Yahoo unschooling gamer group as well as playing on Roblox, and some younger siblings of my older kids&#39; friends. Sometimes, I get on with my son and type for him in the chat boxes (he can&#39;t read/write yet) and he makes temporary friends during his game. Also, we do participate in some classes and/or group activities where he will make a quick friend or two. I try to stay in touch with the parents in case he wants to pursue the friendship, which he occasionally does. I find that outside friendships are not that important to my recently turned 8 year old, nor my 5 year old daughter. My older kids (10 &amp; 12) are much more interested in friends and have made sure to find connections with other kids that work for them, be it in &quot;real life&quot; or in video games. My 10 &amp; 12 year old both consider their best friends to be kids they have met online and Skype with daily.</span></div></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1841350238gmail_extra\"><br clear=\"all\"><div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1841350238gmail_signature\"><div dir=\"ltr\"><div><div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"><font face=\"georgia, serif\" style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;\"></span></font><font><div style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><br></span></div><div style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><br></span></div><div style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><br></span></div><div style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><br></span></div><div style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><br></span></div><div style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Warmly,</span><br></div><div style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;\"> </div><div style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:book antiqua, palatino;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family:book antiqua, palatino;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Megan</strong></span></span></span></span></span></div><div><font face=\"monospace, monospace\">keeping it real since 1981</font></div><div style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;\"><br></div></font><div style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;\"></div><p style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;font-size:13px;\"><font face=\"georgia, serif\"><br></font></p><p style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;font-size:13px;\"><font face=\"georgia, serif\"><span></span><span></span><br></font></p></span></div></div></div></div></div>\n<br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1841350238gmail_quote\">On Wed, Feb 8, 2017 at 10:13 PM, Sandra Dodd Sandra@...

The older child is social and comfortable, and makes friends easily. The younger child has a harder time connecting, and generally wants to play with older kids, but that doesn&#39;t always work for the older kids.

I play with him, but I&#39;m not as sparkly, I don&#39;t think. I want to be, I try to be, but I know it&#39;s not the same. Also, I am in school and there are times when I need to do school work and thus am not as available.

My older child is happy there because he is doing some activities he enjoys that I didn&#39;t have resources for, like archery and group games. I am not sure whether to continue in the coop, whether it is hindering my growth as an unschooling parent, whether it is hindering my kids (especially L, the younger).

I set myself up to be ready to work during those times when my kids are both engaged- setting up for &#39;work&#39; can&#39;t be a big ordeal. I need to be able to get to it fast.

It was a challenge for me because I was just starting to really &quot;get&quot; unschooling and I was afraid it would slip away from me and I would slide back into old thought patterns. I made up my mind that instead of letting this experience pull me backwards I would use it as an opportunity to take my understanding to a deeper level. To take the experiences we were having and try to really understand the dynamic of what was happening, how it was effecting the kids there - including my own - and use my new unschooling knowledge to see beneath the surface of what was happening. It was not an easy time but I can see in hindsight how much we all learned and grew from that experience. I emerged much stronger and clearer in my understanding. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you see yourself sliding back into old, engrained thought patterns, spend some time questioning yourself and thinking through why you think differently now and use it as an opportunity to move thoughtfully forward. Sliding back isn&#39;t a problem if you recognize that you&#39;re doing it and choose to move forward and work your way through the puzzle. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for staying at the co-op, how do your boys feel about it? Do they want to continue? Why or why not? What can you do to support them to make it a better fit? And when/if THEY decide it&#39;s not a good fit then gracefully find a way to support them, whether that be supporting them so they do feel happy to continue or help extricate them from the commitment as gracefully as you can manage. <br/>\n<br/>\n--How am I getting in my own way?--<br/>\n<br/>\nBy thinking this is something that you need to &quot;fix&quot; rather than letting it gently unfold while you support. By thinking it&#39;s a yes or no question. Life is not a test, it&#39;s an experience that unfolds. Try to tweak and nudge as you flow with it, not make huge definitive statements or have set expectations. Focus on the good and beautiful, try to expand that instead of focusing on the negative and scaring yourself into a feeling of failure or helplessness. <br/>\n<br/>\nLife will have challenges. Don&#39;t expect that if you do it &quot;just right&quot; there won&#39;t be bumps in the road. Accept the bumps and don&#39;t let them overwhelm you or take them as a sign of your inadequacy. Being unschoolers does not opt us out of life&#39;s challenges. Hopefully it gives us tools to think things through and make thoughtful choices and decisions so that we can gracefully flow forward through our experiences. <br/>\n<br/>\n-Cass<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPhone</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":495438666,"authorName":"Sarah Thompson","from":"Sarah Thompson &lt;thompsonisland@...&gt;","profile":"wallacesmum","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Finding friends","postDate":"1477762306","msgId":77561,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBUHYrY1l3UUM3cndPclIyQjQxQXN1RUVnTXRLb0U4MVZ3dUF5RSsrUGtXZ0FwNnBtQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":77562,"prevInTime":77560,"nextInTime":77562,"topicId":77561,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My almost 7yo often says he is bored if his brother isn t playing with him.
