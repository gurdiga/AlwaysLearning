I think it is a grouchy <br/>\nrant.***<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, I&#39;ve never been able to read the whole poem straight way through. <br/>\n I&#39;ve tried a few times over the years but I found it so mean and cruel that I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t ever finish it.  I remember reading one of his books allowed to my kids <br/>\nonce and ran into an anti-tv bit and I remember skipping over it.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nusually censor things I read to my kids, but they were enjoying the book so much <br/>\nand I could sense their happiness and I didn&#39;t want to bring that happy crusher <br/>\nbit into the story.  It wasn&#39;t even very integral to the story to begin with. <br/>\n Not even in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the movie, is it so much a part <br/>\nof the story that it need be included.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of my kids liked both of those movies and both of them really disliked the <br/>\nchild shaming bits that are added in.  They had the same issue with Nanny <br/>\nMcPhee.  Both of my girls have watched the movie Matilda, literally hundreds of <br/>\ntimes.  All of us can recite many bits of the movie.  We tried reading the book <br/>\nand never finished it.  Roald Dahl has beautiful stories, but he adds that bit <br/>\nof negative child shaming stuff into it that we really can&#39;t read his books.  I <br/>\nlove that the movie version of Matilda didn&#39;t have that.  The child shamers were <br/>\nthe bad guys.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like to read and watch happy empowering things!  It&#39;s one reason that we LOVE <br/>\nHayao Miyazaki, excepting Grave of the Fireflies (it&#39;s very very sad)!  That and <br/>\nthey have powerful girls as the central characters!  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I agree, it&#39;s a grouchy rant, one that gets my stomach in knots because it is <br/>\nso very unhappy and cruel.  Reading these posts left me having read more of that <br/>\npoem than I have ever read of it thus far.  There are just too many sad things <br/>\nin the world and I try to live in a way that brings peace and happiness to the <br/>\nforefront of my thoughts.  I&#39;ve seen way too many kids destroyed by the negative <br/>\ncynicism of their parents and I do NOT want that for my kids.  I&#39;m their buffer <br/>\nas much as possible, and my thoughts count because what I think, I act and <br/>\nbehave.

If one person is using ban to mean an authority figure is preventing<br/>\nsomeone from seeing something and another person is using ban to mean<br/>\nsomeone choosing not to watch something, it&#39;s very difficult to discuss<br/>\nwhether banning is good or not when neither realizes they aren&#39;t meaning the<br/>\nsame thing when they say &quot;ban&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was an infamous heated discussion on the Unschooling.com message<br/>\nbaords that went on for a couple of days where one word was unknowingly<br/>\nbeing used with 3 different meanings. Person A would read the arguments<br/>\nassuming the word was being used as person A meant it and be flabbergasted<br/>\nthat others could believe such things and then Person A would counter argue.<br/>\nPerson B wouldn&#39;t realize Person A was using a different meaning to the word<br/>\nand be flabbergasted that someone was flabbergasted.

That&#39;s what a good<br/>\nparent would do. If you&#39;re using authoritarian images -- ban -- to describe<br/>\nhelping a child gain power over something that bothers him, then you&#39;re<br/>\nreinforcing (in an unschooling context) people&#39;s idea that they do need to<br/>\ntake over and be the barrier between their children and the big mean world.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that doesn&#39;t help them help their children.

My older son, Thomas, is extremely<br/>\nsensative and lacks a lot of filtering ability that<br/>\nmost people have.  He is definately what would be<br/>\ndescribed as a &quot;special needs&quot; kid and takes special<br/>\nconsideration.  More and more kids now are being born<br/>\nwith &quot;special needs&quot; similar to our son.  Why is that?<br/>\n Chemicals in our food and environment?  Other<br/>\nenvironmental changes?  Some sort of evolutionary<br/>\nspin?  All of those?  Who knows..the point is that<br/>\nwhen some families say that they &quot;HAD&quot; to cut out tv<br/>\nor certain programming, you can&#39;t judge them all by<br/>\nthe same standard.  Not all kids are the same.  This<br/>\nis what happened with Thomas.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he was younger (3-4-5) we had to &quot;ban&quot; certain<br/>\nmovies/shows at home, not by choice, but out of<br/>\nnecessity.  It was a mutual ban, where we talked with<br/>\nhim about how his behavior was being affected and how<br/>\nmaybe he should wait a while before trying those<br/>\nprograms again and he agreed.  We could afford cable<br/>\nat that time and tv watching was really profoundly<br/>\naffecting all our lives in a negative way.  We didn&#39;t<br/>\nlimit their choices at all, and the results for us<br/>\nwere scary.  Our younger child has always been of a<br/>\npatient and gentle disposition and doesn&#39;t have the<br/>\nspecial needs of his brother, so filtering and<br/>\nbehaviors never became an issue for him personally. <br/>\nHis brother&#39;s behavior affected all of us, however,<br/>\nhim most of all.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat shows?  Well Disney&#39;s 101 Dalmations was one of<br/>\nthem.  The most colorful and impressive character on<br/>\nthat show is of course Cruella.  Our son was emulating<br/>\nher behavior, slapping his little brother full across<br/>\nthe face, calling him or us &quot;You Idiot!&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;Imbiciles!&quot; and emulating other of her behaviors. <br/>\nThere were also shows which gave him horrible<br/>\nnightmares, which he is prone to, and were causing<br/>\nsleepless nights and a lot of stress for all of us. <br/>\nThere were other shows in which the main problems were<br/>\nviolent or uncontrolled behaviors emulated.  These<br/>\nwere not one time &quot;experimentation&quot; things.  We tried<br/>\ntalking with him about the behaviors.  Without fail,<br/>\neach time he viewed the shows, there would come the<br/>\nbehaviors afterwards.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe still does this today, emulating what he sees in<br/>\ngames, in videos, or hears in stories, running to<br/>\ninvent a game based on things he&#39;s just been exposed<br/>\nto.  I know that&#39;s normal for kids, and now he does it<br/>\nin a more normally selective way and is better able to<br/>\nunderstand what is socially acceptable behavior and<br/>\nwhat is &quot;bad guy&quot; stuff, although we still sometimes<br/>\nhave to talk to him about that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCurrent examples of ongoing problems from tv:  It&#39;s<br/>\nNOT ok to spit on people when you are really angry<br/>\nwith them, even if the hero does it to the bad guy in<br/>\na movie (particularly when you are talking about<br/>\nsomeone with an explosive temperment who is mad a<br/>\nlot)... It&#39;s NOT ok to punch/kick/bite/head butt/etc.<br/>\nothers because they are saying something you don&#39;t<br/>\nlike, which is not just about teasing but also when he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get his way or we&#39;re not doing what he<br/>\nwants....Dropping your pants in public, or in other<br/>\nways exposing yourself at home, is not funny, even if<br/>\nit seems really funny in a movie (this is from a<br/>\nsomewhat nudist family where we believe skin is<br/>\nhealthy, and the boys still bathe together, and we<br/>\ndon&#39;t hide in shame when we&#39;re dressing and we let<br/>\nthem run around naked in our private forested home in<br/>\nthe summertime or swim in their little pool naked -<br/>\nbut I&#39;m talking about imappropriately being nasty - so<br/>\nmuch so that he is currently not allowed to go without<br/>\npants at home because when the pants go, his humanity<br/>\nseems to go also....Cussing people out and calling<br/>\nnames (he&#39;s picked up some doozies from tv) is not<br/>\ncool, funny, or acceptable at home or elsewhere - this<br/>\nfrom a family that doesn&#39;t believe in &quot;bad words&quot; and<br/>\nhas no problem with the kids cussing at home and<br/>\nplaying with words, but I am talking about being<br/>\nhateful and hurtful to people, like when you tell your<br/>\nkid there is no more ice cream and he screams that you<br/>\nare a stupid fucking pig bitch, well, that&#39;s a<br/>\nproblem....<br/>\n<br/>\nThese days he will ask us for help in making decisions<br/>\nabout movies to watch.  He will ask us &quot;Is this too<br/>\nscary for me?&quot;  or  &quot;IS this ok for kids?&quot;  Which is<br/>\nhis way of asking if it&#39;s ok for HIM in particular. <br/>\nLot&#39;s of gore (ie: Gladiator, Braveheart, etc) or lots<br/>\nof terror/tragedy he cannot handle.  The oddest things<br/>\ngive him horrible nightmares (like the Wizard of Oz,<br/>\nor Sleeping Beauty, which he still will not watch) and<br/>\nthen incongruous things never seem to bother him at<br/>\nall or cause any behavior problems (like Conan, The<br/>\nMummy, Air Force One.)  He will stop us partway into a<br/>\nmovie he has not seen before and say &quot;I don&#39;t like<br/>\nthis&quot; or &quot;It&#39;s scaring me&quot; and turn it off.  He will<br/>\nsometimes stop us partway through movies he HAS seen<br/>\nbefore and say the same things, as though he is at a<br/>\ndevelopmental stage where it bothers him now, where<br/>\nbefore it didn&#39;t.  He may watch a movie all the way<br/>\nthrough and then not ask for it again for years, which<br/>\nis another indication that he was not ready for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway my point is that not all kids are exactly<br/>\nalike.  Some are more impressionable, or less able to<br/>\ndecipher the complex social clues in movies to<br/>\nunderstand what is satire or what is not ok in real<br/>\nlife.  Some adults are like that too, for that matter.<br/>\n It&#39;s not a matter of intelligence levels, but of<br/>\nintelligence types and different ways of absorbing<br/>\ninformation.  It&#39;s especially important for people<br/>\nlike that to have early practice deciphering those<br/>\nclues and understanding socially acceptable behaviors<br/>\nbecause it&#39;s not as natural for them to understand and<br/>\nthey NEED more practice.  But it&#39;s also important not<br/>\nto drown them with stimuli (which is not hard to do<br/>\nwhen they lack filtering tools and self control) while<br/>\nthey are trying to learn these things.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57441,"nextTopicId":57471}}
