Jake had a closed umbrella in his hand, and his right foot <br/>\nwas crossed over the left.  The umbrella was whizzing along the wall of the <br/>\nescalator near the top of Jake&#39;s foot, which was very close to the side, and <br/>\nsomehow while he shifted his weight the umbrella got lower and helped his shoe <br/>\nget pulled into the space between the escalator stair and the wall.  Halfway up, <br/>\nhe screamed in pain, and I looked and noticed what was happening.  I knew I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want him to reach the top with his foot stuck like that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWith Jon still on my back, I lept up in one giant step the 4 or 5 steps to <br/>\nthe top, leaned over with my free hand, grabbed Jake by the upper arm and yanked <br/>\nhim free, all the way clear of the escalator behind me, and all the while <br/>\navoiding the shredder at the top of the stairs.  It was truly herculean, and it <br/>\nwas *easy*.  I can still remember what it felt like.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdrenaline is the only way to explain how I did that.  Jake was wearing high <br/>\ntops Nike&#39;s.  The rubber edge was cut through on the top and bottom of his <br/>\nshoe, and his toes were red and pinched, but they would be just fine.  I screamed <br/>\nfor an employee and she called the manager and I blackmailed a new pair of <br/>\nshoes out of him, saying it could have been a lot worse and they&#39;d be getting <br/>\noff easy with just new pair of shoes.  We went down to the shoe department and <br/>\ngot Jake all fixed up.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we finally got to the car, I completely fell apart, shaking and crying, <br/>\nand was unable to drive for a good 20 minutes.  Then we all went home and had <br/>\na good long nap.

He took the weight of the dresser on the back of his left \r<br/>\nshoulder and had his stomach pressed into the top of the drawer his \r<br/>\nwas sitting in. I know understand hom parents are a ble to perform \r<br/>\namazing feats to get to their kids, I shoved the dresser out of the \r<br/>\nway and ended up throwing the drawers across the room to get to him. \r<br/>\nWe ended up going to the ER he couldn&#39;t lift his arm and said his \r<br/>\nstomach really hurt. We got there and he couldn&#39;t eat or drink \r<br/>\nanything, Avery was running all over the place with my mom chasing \r<br/>\nhim, Jason was about 45 miles inland and it took him a couple of \r<br/>\nhours to get there. Everything was okay until we got into our room, \r<br/>\nwhen Jaiden started to get really scared and was begging me to take \r<br/>\nhim home, he was crying and trying so hard to be brave but was so \r<br/>\nscared and nothing I could say was making him feel better. Jason \r<br/>\nfinally got there, we had yet to see a dr. A resident finally came in \r<br/>\nand looked him over and decided to order blood work, xrays, and cat \r<br/>\nscans but wouldn&#39;t tell us if anything was wrong. None of us had \r<br/>\neaten they still wouldn&#39;t let jaiden even have a drink of water, he \r<br/>\nwas upset, I was upset, and Jason was getting mad. Jason finally told \r<br/>\nJaiden to get dressed we were leaving. He told hte nurce he wanted \r<br/>\nour dicharge papers. I was shaking, so afraid that something was \r<br/>\nwrong with Jaiden, even though by tis time other than being tired, \r<br/>\nhungry, very thirsty and a little achy he said and seemed fine. our \r<br/>\ndecision to leave seemed to really upset the nurces and they got the \r<br/>\nhead dr. over to look at him. He decided after really looking at him \r<br/>\nthat he was fine and we were okay to go home. He was also nice enough \r<br/>\nto give Jaiden a popsicle. So our day turned out good, Jaiden was and \r<br/>\nis fine but we are all still upset and cranky and thank you for \r<br/>\nletting me get this out.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nRebecca\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nYahoo!

We got there and he couldn&#39;t eat or drink<br/>\n&gt; anything, Avery was running all over the place with my mom chasing<br/>\n&gt; him, Jason was about 45 miles inland and it took him a couple of<br/>\n&gt; hours to get there. Everything was okay until we got into our room,<br/>\n&gt; when Jaiden started to get really scared and was begging me to take<br/>\n&gt; him home, he was crying and trying so hard to be brave but was so<br/>\n&gt; scared and nothing I could say was making him feel better. Jason<br/>\n&gt; finally got there, we had yet to see a dr. A resident finally came in<br/>\n&gt; and looked him over and decided to order blood work, xrays, and cat<br/>\n&gt; scans but wouldn&#39;t tell us if anything was wrong. None of us had<br/>\n&gt; eaten they still wouldn&#39;t let jaiden even have a drink of water, he<br/>\n&gt; was upset, I was upset, and Jason was getting mad. Jason finally told<br/>\n&gt; Jaiden to get dressed we were leaving. He told hte nurce he wanted<br/>\n&gt; our dicharge papers. I was shaking, so afraid that something was<br/>\n&gt; wrong with Jaiden, even though by tis time other than being tired,<br/>\n&gt; hungry, very thirsty and a little achy he said and seemed fine. our<br/>\n&gt; decision to leave seemed to really upset the nurces and they got the<br/>\n&gt; head dr. over to look at him. He decided after really looking at him<br/>\n&gt; that he was fine and we were okay to go home. He was also nice enough<br/>\n&gt; to give Jaiden a popsicle. So our day turned out good, Jaiden was and<br/>\n&gt; is fine but we are all still upset and cranky and thank you for<br/>\n&gt; letting me get this out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Rebecca<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
