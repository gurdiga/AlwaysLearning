Giant","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1333089106\">When I was 13, 14, & 15, we lived in Mapleton, Oregon.<br/>\n About 20 or so miles from the Pacific Ocean, on the<br/>\nSiuslaw River.  One hour from Eugene.  Giant licorice<br/>\nferns, WONDERFUL boison berries, hills, moutains,<br/>\ntrees, mud slides (in forest denuded areas), rocks,<br/>\nnear 100% humidity all the time, wild<br/>\nrhododendrons....  No big rain drops, no thunder,no<br/>\nlightening, no tornadoes, no poisonous snakes.  It was<br/>\nethereal and damp, misty, swirling lavender and grey. <br/>\nI walked in the forests always, lived in the trees,<br/>\nmade a wickiup from my brother&#39;s and me..... <br/>\n<br/>\nLumber was the ONLY industry (my step-father was a<br/>\ncivil engineer for USFS....we had a bit more fortunate<br/>\nstandard of living than most of the locals) The 4 <br/>\nyear high school had 200 students. 100 freshmen, 50<br/>\nsophomores, 30 juniors, and 20 seniors of which 10<br/>\nwould usually graduate.  At school pep rallies they<br/>\nhad noise contests....the boys brought chain saws to<br/>\nschool to make lots of noise. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was too wet for mosquitoes most of the time. And<br/>\neven I had  a little bit of curl in my hair. No snow<br/>\nin the yard, but there was snow about an hour away.<br/>\nHot mineral springs for bathing a half hour away in<br/>\nthe other direction. Clear, pristine springs for<br/>\ndrinking water were above our house. We swam in the<br/>\nriver.  There was a covered bridge across the river.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother HATED this area.  She added to her<br/>\naddictions prescription barbiturates while here.  But<br/>\nif you like the beautiful  swirling foggy misty<br/>\nmagical rain forest  that would be the spot.  Watch<br/>\nout for falling rock on the highway between Eugene and<br/>\nthe coast.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMost people living there (on the Siuslaw)had a low<br/>\nincome, so cost of living is low, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course it has been almost 40 years since I&#39;ve been<br/>\nthere. <br/>\n<br/>\nCave Junction has (had?) a surprisingly open minded<br/>\nlocal population of grown-up hippies. One of my little<br/>\nbrothers bought property there and built an off the<br/>\ngrid giant log home which he has since sold (for<br/>\nreasons other than the being happy there)and moved<br/>\nback to FL.  But he said there was lots of social,<br/>\nemotional, and actual physical support and sharing of<br/>\nlabor, ideas, and resources. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust some nostalgia for the ethereal. But do watch out<br/>\nfor bears while picking berries.<br/>\n<br/>\nSharon of the Swamp<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

I&#39;ve tried to keep up with what&#39;s going on but have<br/>\nfailed miserably.... Good job I&#39;m not being tested on whether I read every<br/>\ne-mail.<br/>\n<br/>\nShyrly in UAE (?).... I&#39;m looking for the same place that you are and<br/>\ncurrently live in the desert of Tucson... Must be something wrong with us<br/>\nBritish women who marry Americans who then cart us off to places which will<br/>\ndestroy our beautiful english rose skin (LOL)....<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are looking at Northern California and have narrowed it down to somewhere<br/>\nbetween Sacramento and Redding (to start with)... I know it&#39;s hot there in<br/>\nthe summer, but not hot compared to 5 months of over 100 degrees like<br/>\nTucson.  I feel like I&#39;m going to be made into a leather handbag anyday<br/>\nnow... I don&#39;t even lay out in the sun and I&#39;m sun tanned....<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my friends was telling me about a book she&#39;s reading about how to<br/>\nhelp her kids (ages 6 and 7) with their homework and I was saying nothing<br/>\n(this is new for me to keep my mouth shut)... After a few minutes of me not<br/>\ncommenting she said &quot;you&#39;re not saying anything&quot;... I asked &quot;what would you<br/>\nlike me to say?&quot;  &quot;don&#39;t you have a comment, you usually do&quot;... &quot;Nope&quot;.....<br/>\nAnd then I couldn&#39;t resist as she was pushing me so I said &quot;if you prefer to<br/>\nspend your time reading books on how to get your kids to do homework, rather<br/>\nthan just spending time with your kids, that&#39;s up to you&quot;..... &quot;Oh&quot;  was the<br/>\nresponse.... Next time I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll ask....<br/>\n<br/>\nI was doing so well with keeping my mouth shut.  I guess practice makes<br/>\nperfect.....<br/>\n<br/>\nDH is planning on quitting his job at the end of August to stay home full<br/>\ntime with the kids and let me turn my business into a &quot;real&quot; full time<br/>\ncareer that will support us.  I&#39;m sure this is going to be a transition and<br/>\nwe&#39;ll be fine.  The boys are really looking forward to it.  DH has started<br/>\nto take off time from work so we all get used to the idea and he gets to go<br/>\non more field trips...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we are deliberating whether to move to Northern California and have DH<br/>\nquit his job at the same time.  I hear they are 2 of the most stressful<br/>\nthings... One good part would be we get them both over with all at once...<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some meanderings to get me back in the loop.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing... Someone sent me a link to an unschooling magazine.  Many of<br/>\nyou probably already subscribe but if not I thought I&#39;d pass it on.
