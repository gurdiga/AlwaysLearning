I have 2 <br/>\ndaughters, 12 and 10, and 2 sons, 4 and 2 (in June). Until this year <br/>\nI always used text books... YUK ! We all hated it, but I didn&#39;t know <br/>\nwhat else to do. This year I started out like all other... bought the <br/>\nbooks, cried the tears, constantly heard... &quot;I hate school&quot; &quot;Why do I <br/>\nhave to do this again?&quot; and so on. It was when I found the <br/>\nwords, &quot;Why don&#39;t we just enroll them in real school&quot; that I realized <br/>\nthis is a bad thing we are doing. So, I went on ebay.. sold all the <br/>\nschool text books (except math... please don&#39;t hate me). I don&#39;t know <br/>\nif I have officially become an unschooler. We have done more unit <br/>\ntype things, (I think). Basically I let my girls choose a topic, at <br/>\nfirst I had to come up with an idea... after all I have stunted there <br/>\nown desire to learn. And we went out and found information. We used <br/>\nthe internet a lot... the book stores were fun, and the library. <br/>\nWhenever I could we would go to a place, field trip. For instance we <br/>\nstudied Florida and since we live near St Augustine, we went there. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis year we did so much more than we have ever done any other year. <br/>\nNow, near the end of the year, my girls are choosing the topics on <br/>\ntheir own. I find them on the computer all the time, looking up <br/>\nsomething that they saw. We got a Beta fish and my oldest daughter <br/>\ncan&#39;t seem to find enough information about it. This has been such a <br/>\nwonderful year. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, my questions are... is this the way other Unschoolers approach <br/>\nlearning? Or can someone give me pointers. And... I know the math <br/>\nissue is going to hit a nerve with many of you. I am very open and <br/>\nwould love to through away that book as well. Can you tell me how to <br/>\nteach math without a book? I know that math is in everything we do... <br/>\ncooking, sewing, and more. But I do have to have an evaluation or <br/>\ntesting done at the end of every year here in FL. So how would <br/>\nI &quot;prove math&quot; in an evaluation, if we have no book? Gosh, I hope I <br/>\ndon&#39;t get a bunch of hate mail over this.... :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI really want to learn and grow. So, please feel free to give advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca<br/>\nNew to Unschooling and loving every second of it...</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6481,"nextTopicId":6490}}
