I have been having this problem with <br/>\nmy 4 year old girl.  I am trying really hard to not shame her, but I <br/>\ndo have a big reaction.  For me, I think I have trouble because I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know how much of it bothers me because she was molested almost <br/>\na year ago and how much is just me being a very &quot;normal&quot; bothered <br/>\nbecause it&#39;s inappropriate.  I tell her that it&#39;s her body, but she <br/>\ncan&#39;t play with herself in front of anybody.  I tell her that in <br/>\nprivate it&#39;s fine.  It&#39;s hard to know if saying something is private <br/>\nis shaming or not.  Child molesters sometimes say things like &#39;let&#39;s <br/>\nkeep this private&#39; and such.  I really don&#39;t know how strong my <br/>\nreaction comes across to her, when she touches herself I am overcome <br/>\nwith grief over what happened to her.  It&#39;s hard not to think that <br/>\none is related to the other.  It&#39;s good to read that it&#39;s fairly <br/>\nnormal and that it&#39;s good to have a fairly normal &quot;that&#39;s <br/>\ninnapropriate&quot; reaction.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t want to teach her that bodies are bad in anyway.  Well, this <br/>\nis pretty choppy writing, but it&#39;s so emotionally charged that I have <br/>\nsome trouble with it.  So, thanks for all the posts.  It has helped <br/>\nme a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Amy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I didn&#39;t want to come across like someone who thought someone  <br/>\n&gt; touching herself/himself because it felt good was immoral or  <br/>\n&gt; illegal.
