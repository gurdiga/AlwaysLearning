Still, in Elsie, Alfred, Albert, which <br/>\nused to be written with an æ   (combined letter like an a and e stuck together <br/>\nand written all in one motion, when done by hand, and called &quot;ash&quot;/æsc).   My <br/>\nSCA name is Ælflæd (Elf-led) but those vowels would be pronounced a little <br/>\ndifferently in whatever dialect the speaker was speaking.<br/>\n<br/>\nA friend&#39;s name is French, &quot;Helene,&quot; with an accent on the middle syllable, <br/>\nand it can&#39;t really be pronounced in running English text very well.   Sounds <br/>\nlike &quot;ehLYNN&quot; but the &quot;n&quot; is pronounced differently from English and it&#39;s kind <br/>\nof a tongue-stopper, and awkward.   So she&#39;s gone by &quot;Helena&quot; most of her <br/>\nlife.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy neice&#39;s name is Eugenia--not in English, but in Spanish, so kind of <br/>\n&quot;youHAINeeya&quot; sort of, and she&#39;s called Gina.    Less convenient for her than if <br/>\nthey had called her &quot;Gina,&quot; but her dad&#39;s name is Eugenio.   He goes by Gene too, <br/>\nexcept to elderly relatives.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was interviewed for a BBC article on unpronounceable names a little while <br/>\nback.   I&#39;m a&#39;gin &#39;em, and the guy found an article I&#39;d written for SCA <br/>\npurposes and called me.   It&#39;s a short interview.   The way   he wrote out my <br/>\ndifferent pronunciations of &quot;Sandra&quot; aren&#39;t the way I would&#39;ve transcribed them, but <br/>\nmaybe they&#39;ll work for Brits.   And I said &quot;the northeastern U.S.,&quot; not New <br/>\nYork--he extrapolated that one.   <br/>\n<br/>\nnews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4180664.stm<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who&#39;d rather read it here (sorry for long, long post)<br/>\nHow are you spelling that?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn death, as in life, when people spoke about Robert Moog, his name sounded <br/>\nlike the noise a cow makes.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a man who did so much to broaden the range of sounds available to the <br/>\nhuman ear - from prog rock to electronica - it might have been something of an <br/>\nirony that people couldn&#39;t get his name right.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Moog should not have rhymed with &quot;fugue&quot;. It&#39;s pronounced &quot;Mogue&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoog was once asked by an interviewer for the definitive word on his name. He <br/>\nwas quite clear: &quot;It rhymes with vogue. That is the usual German <br/>\npronunciation. My father&#39;s grandfather came from Marburg, Germany. I like the way that <br/>\npronunciation sounds better than the way the cow&#39;s &#39;moo-g&#39; sounds.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMoog was not alone in having a name people couldn&#39;t pronounce properly. <br/>\nPeople called Håkon, Jiye, Michi, Elissa, Asa, Nara and Laszlo have each written on <br/>\nthe web about going through life with people not knowing how to say their <br/>\nnames. Some have resorted to publishing MP3 files of the correct pronunciation.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst-hand experience<br/>\n<br/>\nPsychologist Dr Mallory Wober (pronounced &quot;woe-ber&quot;) has been studying <br/>\npeople&#39;s names for nearly 40 years, fascinated among other things by how Zipf&#39;s law <br/>\non the &quot;principle of least effort&quot; results in names being abbreviated.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut he knows from first hand experience what&#39;s it&#39;s like for people <br/>\nconstantly to mis-pronounce his name.<br/>\n<br/>\n The way I react to how people say my name on the whole it depends what I <br/>\nwant from them<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;My surname is terrible,&quot; he says. &quot;It results in all sorts of creative <br/>\ninterpretations, though it is not all bad - if for instance junk mail comes with my <br/>\nname spelt wrongly, I feel absolute licence to throw it away.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But the way I react to how people say my name on the whole it depends what I <br/>\nwant from them, or from the relationship. If I need some help in a shop, and <br/>\nsomeone mispronounces my name, then I am probably going to put up with it <br/>\nsince I need him to spend some time to talk to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s never happened, and as I&#39;m 69 it&#39;s a distant chance, but if an <br/>\nattractive young woman insisted on mispronouncing my name, I might well end up finding <br/>\nit charming.&quot;<br/>\nBut, he added, if someone rang him and used the correct pronunciation, then <br/>\nautomatically he would know where he stood with the other person and that it <br/>\nwas likely to be a conversation worth having.<br/>\n<br/>\nFluency<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd from Albuquerque, New Mexico, calls herself &quot;Sanndra&quot;; people <br/>\nfrom New York call her &quot;Sarndra&quot;, people from Texas call her &quot;Sa-endra&quot;. To some <br/>\nof her friends, however, she is Ælflæd (pronounced &quot;Elf-led&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nDodd is a member of the Society for Creative Anachronism, whose members take <br/>\npart in medieval and Renaissance role-play. This means taking on medieval <br/>\nnames - another name she considered was &quot;Wulfrun&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving an unusual name in this context is obviously not a problem for her. <br/>\n&quot;Anyone who is fluent in Middle English knows how to pronounce it,&quot; she says.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe names of some of her fellow members have actually gone beyond role-play, <br/>\nshe says. Some have decided they actually prefer their medieval name in real <br/>\nlife - one member, previously known as Robert, changed his name to Cathyn, a <br/>\nname which dates from the 1200s.<br/>\n<br/>\nDr Wober has done much research into the assumptions people make based solely <br/>\non names - eg Antoinette is attractive and flighty, Susan is solid and <br/>\ntrustworthy.<br/>\nPerhaps this is why persistent mis-pronunciation can be so frustrating to <br/>\npeople who suffer from it, as it could imply a different set of assumptions.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven the tendency Dr Wober has noted for people to gravitate towards <br/>\nsingle-syllable - and thus straightforward - names does not always avoid <br/>\nmisunderstanding though.<br/>\nFilm-maker Tom Tanner - a man blessed with a simple, easily pronounceable <br/>\nname - proudly recalls the occasion he answered his phone to a person wanting to <br/>\nspeak to &quot;Town Planner&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23413,"nextTopicId":23452}}
