Time is running out, so order soon to get things by  <br/>\nthe 24th!)<br/>\nAlternatively, the image in a variety of sizes may be lifted freely  <br/>\nfor use:<br/>\n                  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/learnnothingday/images\">http://sandradodd.com/learnnothingday/images</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnimal:  The photo/image should have at least one animal of some  <br/>\nsort, and the logo.<br/>\nMineral:  The mineral is... a mirror.  Silicon as in glass. Or  <br/>\nsilicon as represented by a computer.  MIrror or computer (not  <br/>\npottery or bricks or sand or rocks, though they can be there  <br/>\nsecondarily, of course, in any of the photos).  And the logo.<br/>\nVegetable:  Plant(s) and the logo.  The photo can also have people,  <br/>\nanimals, whatever... but having a botanical element is the ticket.<br/>\nVideo:  The logo in a video or animated gif or flash cartoon or  <br/>\nsomething.  An image that moves, and that I can put on a webpage.<br/>\n<br/>\nImages can be profound, or funny, or artsy, or might show people not  <br/>\nlearning, or learning.  Have fun with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be several-to-many judges, at least two of whom aren&#39;t  <br/>\nunschoolers and won&#39;t know anyone involved.<br/>\nMy relatives are ineligible.<br/>\nEntry equals agreement to let me put the image on a webpage with  <br/>\nother Learn Nothing Day art and materials.<br/>\nEntrants can be individuals or teams or families.<br/>\nMore than one category is fine.<br/>\nMore than one entry per category is fine.<br/>\nEntries can be on blogs or other places first, during and after the  <br/>\ncontest.  No problem.  Send me an image or a link to the image.   <br/>\nYou&#39;ll still own it, but I want to be able to have them on display  <br/>\nall year until next Learn Nothing Day (or indefinitely, if this is  <br/>\nthe last one ever).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWinners will receive a one-of-a-kind quite-personalized certificate,  <br/>\nand a copy of Moving a Puddle or a set of Thinking Sticks.<br/>\nIf the winner has all that stuff already, I&#39;ll send something else.   <br/>\nI don&#39;t know what.  Depends who wins.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be at least four winning entries, and maybe more.<br/>\n<br/>\nEntries will be accepted through July 26, with winners announced by  <br/>\nthe end of July.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought about writing and poetry, but that disturbed me with school- <br/>\nand-teacher feelings.  Writing should be for fun and practicality.   <br/>\nAnd so I do apologize for those of you who have been art students and  <br/>\nmight have school-and-teacher feelings wrapped up in imagery.  Sorry  <br/>\nabout that.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere end the rules and the disclaimers.    You might think of some  <br/>\nquestions, and that could lead to more rules.<br/>\nY&#39;know why it  has rules?  Because it&#39;s a game.  Thanks for playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36158,"nextTopicId":36342}}
