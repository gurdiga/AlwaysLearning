I&#39;ve been<br/>\ntrying to stay out of this conversation. My input is the games your son is<br/>\ntrying to master are too advanced for his current skillset and since he sees<br/>\nhis brother playing same said games his ego is getting too many hits. His<br/>\nskills will get better from use over time, but only to the level of ability<br/>\nhe personally has and if his brother is just better at the hand/eye<br/>\ncoordination necessary, he might always be behind his brothers levels on the<br/>\nsame type of game, just like if they were playing football, one might be<br/>\nvarsity material, one might not be in football but might be in wrestling.<br/>\nThere are lots of different genres of games. If he can have an xbox and only<br/>\ndifferent games on the xbox that are only his to play (his own system and<br/>\nthe ps2 his brothers with his own games) maybe he could master different<br/>\ntypes of games without his ego getting killed. Can&#39;t really know this is<br/>\nwhat is happening since I don&#39;t know him, but it looks that way from the<br/>\noutside looking in. -Arlynn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn 2/22/06 11:42 AM, &quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&quot;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24584,"nextTopicId":24587}}
