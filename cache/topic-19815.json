While <br/>\ndigging through my paperwork I found a copy of a letter I submitted to &quot;Growing <br/>\nWithout Schooling&quot;, the John Holt newsletter back in 1983.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son Shawn (then age 9) and I were talking.  He asked when he would go back <br/>\nto school.  I asked him when he thought he&#39;d want to go back.  After a while <br/>\nhe replied that he didn&#39;t think you could homeschool college.  I then asked <br/>\nhim if he wanted to go to college.  He stated that since he was skipping all <br/>\nthese grades, and not learning anything, he wouldn&#39;t be able to get in anyway!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI assured him he was learning.  It seems a peer had told Shawn since he <br/>\nwasn&#39;t taking spelling tests, he couldn&#39;t spell.  That made sense to Shawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m happy to report that Shawn did actually learn something.  He graduated <br/>\nfrom college last December and has been accepted for graduate school to begin <br/>\nthis fall (he&#39;s now age 29).<br/>\n<br/>\nThought you might enjoy this little story!  It made me chuckle.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\nwww.homeschoolingreflections.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19814,"nextTopicId":19816}}
