He&#39;s not unschooled or homeschooled, just <br/>\nfound my video games page and wrote to me.   He just responded:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Thanks for the notification, here is a short summery of my gaming life. I <br/>\nam<br/>\nstill playing video games, and sadly still arguing with my parents over<br/>\nevery last minute I play them. I am now in high school, and getting straight<br/>\nA&#39;s which still will not get me off the hook. I enjoy RPGs and strategy<br/>\ngames though much of my gaming time is spent playing Guild Wars a<br/>\ncooperative MMORPG on the internet (Elements wrath is my name for any fellow<br/>\nplayer.) Though changes in the stereotypic view of a gamer are definitely<br/>\noccurring, there is still a ways left to go before video games along with<br/>\ncomputer games get the respect they deserve.    -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHis poem is here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/game/poem\">http://sandradodd.com/game/poem</a><br/>\n<br/>\nand the games site can be accessed three reasonably good ways (all are still <br/>\nbeing worked on, and some of the pages lead to are more interesting than <br/>\nothers, but it&#39;s a work in progress):<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/videogames\">http://sandradodd.com/videogames</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/games\">http://sandradodd.com/games</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/gameplay\">http://sandradodd.com/gameplay</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore I knew the site would be so big, I used games/page for the video page. <br/>\n  Very bad name; no one will guess it.   So I changed it to videogames and <br/>\nrealized I should have a guessable &quot;games&quot; page too.
