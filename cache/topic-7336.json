He asked me to help him set up a schedule of study, which I did.  He <br/>\ncontinued to follow his routine of study for months, but never did get around to <br/>\ngoing to school.  I think he got used to the move, and skateboarding went from <br/>\nbeing almost out-lawed to being a focus for the teens on base.  His life got <br/>\nhappier for him, without trying school.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrevor has also suggested his desire to go to school a few times.  He is the <br/>\nlast of the five children, and I think got to feel pretty alone and abandon by <br/>\nthe sibs.  I would simply agree, and he never got to the point of wanting to <br/>\nmake it happen.  When I would casually bring it up, he&#39;d say -- &quot;maybe next <br/>\nyear.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have watched other kids from the homeschooling community go to school.  It <br/>\nhas been for various reasons.  Sometimes they stay and sometimes they don&#39;t.  <br/>\nIn all cases the years of being at home have stood them in good use, and they <br/>\nremained solid in who they were.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife can spin our world every which way - thro death and divorce, moves and <br/>\nbirths, I have found if I trust that my children are following their own path, <br/>\neven tho it isn&#39;t the one I want them on - I can stay more centered and be <br/>\nmore helpful to them.  This isn&#39;t easy -- for me the challenges were my daughter <br/>\nstaying with her father in our family home (at age 14) when we ended the <br/>\nmarriage, and not having contact with my oldest son because of the intense struggle <br/>\nof relationship issues once he was married.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving the children grow up stretches us as parents.  Personally I liked it <br/>\nbetter when they were little and some nursing and story reading made almost <br/>\neverything wonderful again! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\nwww.homeschoolingreflections.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":111638996,"authorName":"Robin Eckert","from":"&quot;Robin Eckert&quot; &lt;robineckert@...&gt;","profile":"dalerobin7","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Going to School","postDate":"1022687117","msgId":7337,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGIwMWMyMDcyNyRkNGYxN2M3MCQ4YTMyYWE0MEBkZTM+","referencesHeader":"PEY0VElnWEhFbnA3WTVwbnJ5TXkwMDAxMTQ1NEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":7336,"nextInTopic":19547,"prevInTime":7336,"nextInTime":7338,"topicId":7336,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"What I see her saying is , Go ahead  and send me to school ,I know you want to be with Riley more then me.

Yes, there are some choices a Parent <br/>\n  needs to make. When I talked with Ashley about this she mentioned several <br/>\n  reasons. She thinks she can make more friends. She even stated she would get <br/>\n  to know people better. She says she can do homework and looks forward to <br/>\n  waking up early all by herself. She says she wants to try for 1 year. She <br/>\n  wants to be able to ride her bike home all by herself. Last year she also <br/>\n  asked 2 weeks before school started. I said I couldn&#39;t switch gears that <br/>\n  fast. I took her to the Home=Ed Conference in Sac. She had a blast and saw <br/>\n  lots of kids and families having fun together. It helped I think normalize <br/>\n  what our family is doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Tim feels it&#39;s ok to try school. We do have &quot;great&quot; schools here in Davis, <br/>\n  lucky us. I&#39;m feeling she wants what her favorite friends have in the court. <br/>\n  They all go off together every morning and come home together every <br/>\n  afternoon. All year we have all been trying to give Ashley what she wants. <br/>\n  She loves organized classes. Here is her list of activities. She is a <br/>\n  brownie, belongs to 4-H, swims now on the swim team, takes gym classes, and <br/>\n  performs musicals (3 a year). If she could, she would also want to take a <br/>\n  clay class, and probably 5 other cool things in our catalogue. We as a <br/>\n  family are meeting a piano teacher today. Ashley and Riley both asked for <br/>\n  this. I have both homeschooled kids and school kids over a lot for Ashley. <br/>\n  Usually this causes lots of conflict for Riley. Exclusion type play. I <br/>\n  arrange play dates for her. She has weekday sleepovers with her homeschooled <br/>\n  friends. Lately she has not really been into some of the girls she normally <br/>\n  plays with.<br/>\n<br/>\n  She has had a tough year, cries alot, is fussy. I do think she wants change <br/>\n  of some sort. Something that is hers alone. I&#39;m thinking a pet might be <br/>\n  good. I have tried to help her with her fussiness, lots of hugs, quality <br/>\n  time, loving comments, baby in my arms. The more you give the more she <br/>\n  wants. She is a big taker too. Doesn&#39;t give back much to the family. Moans <br/>\n  and wails for any task asked. Always has an excuse for why she can&#39;t, set <br/>\n  the table, clear her dish, put her skates away...<br/>\n<br/>\n  She did say when she is at school I can be with Riley. She does acknowledge <br/>\n  her dislike for him and want to be away from him. She really is cold almost <br/>\n  at every interaction they have. Riley is getting much better about staying <br/>\n  out of her space. He finally sees he only gets hurt. I&#39;m still wary of <br/>\n  school. As one friend mentioned it may create a larger divide that has <br/>\n  already been started. Yet I&#39;m feeling this is really important to her. I <br/>\n  also am feeling like wow, I blew it and now she doesn&#39;t like to be home. I <br/>\n  can not toy too much with that thought because it is too depressing.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Summer may help out. Ashley will swim 5 days a week. She can walk a block to <br/>\n  the pool herself. She can have her schooled friends play more. If we are <br/>\n  going to start her in the fall, though, I need to think about paperwork and <br/>\n  securing her a spot in the every overcrowded schools. I&#39;m wondering if I <br/>\n  start all this, letting her get ready to go to school, she will then decide <br/>\n  she really doesn&#39;t want to go. I did tell her if she went and decided she <br/>\n  did not like it she can stop. Ahhhhh. She told me just a few weeks ago how <br/>\n  much she loved being home.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n  Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Your use of Yahoo!
