Is the scenario that you want her to stop using diapers so she&#39;ll be completely independent in this area? If she senses that she&#39;d get LESS connection from you if she&#39;s going on the potty, that may be one reason she&#39;s insisting not just on diapering, but on lying down.

We mostly used cloth, but started using disposables and pullups toward the end. I remember thinking with the way disposables are designed now (and this was 13 years ago!) a kid could go hours and hours without ever feeling wet; I used to joke (not within his hearing) that I was worried those diapers would completely dehydrate him, with all that super-dry stuff in there.

She said, very sadly and with much emotion, &quot;I had to poop in the potty!&quot; and then she proceeded to start crying.  &quot;You did?&quot; I asked, surprised and excited. &quot;How cool!&quot;  I said, and she lit up like a ray of sun, &quot;How cool?&quot; she asked, &quot;I thought you might get mad that I didn&#39;t ask for a diaper.&quot;  I proceeded to give her a big hug, and we went back to bed.

My partner had poo accidents as late as 7, in school and everything - he got to be the kid other kids made fun of, so he was pretty adamant that when Ray was still wetting the bed and having periodic poo accidents during the day at 6 and 7 that we not make a big deal. I can promise you that at 16 he no longer has those issues ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone on another list dealt with a related issue - a dd who didn&#39;t want to have anything to do with diapers - by leaving changes of clothes in convenient places. Maybe you can leave diapers in convenient places if she&#39;s okay changing herself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is it about the diapers she likes? That&#39;s the sort of thing that&#39;s tricky to ask kids, in my experience, because no-one likes to feel on the defensive. If I ask Morgan &quot;why don&#39;t you want to take a bath?&quot; (for example... not many baths here this winter) in a frustrated tone, she&#39;ll glower at me and not reply, but asking in a casual way she&#39;s told me that she&#39;s not dirty and baths are boring<br/>\n- which gave me ideas for problem solving. If your dd likes diapers because she doesn&#39;t want to grow up, for instance, you could find ways to love her that help her feel babied and special. If she likes the way they smell you could get some nice powder. If she just doesn&#39;t want to talk about the matter, that&#39;s fine too, of course - she may simply not be ready in some way. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I am concerned that she may increase her risk for UTI <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve known boys to get UTIs from grubby little hands and girls from too much soap in the bath, but I don&#39;t personally know anyone who&#39;s gotten a UTI from wearing a diaper.

He&#39;s 9 now, and what I&#39;ve seen over and over (often after I&#39;ve been fretting over something for quite awhile) is that he does them when he&#39;s ready, and once he does, you can&#39;t tell the difference between him and the kids who did it earlier. This has applied to walking, putting his own clothes on, using the toilet independently, giving up thumb-sucking...a whole long list.<br/>\n<br/>\nEric is often physically ready or able to do something long before he&#39;s psychologically or emotionally ready to do it. It can be frustrating as a parent (&quot;he could dress himself if he just _would_!&quot;) and has gotten him some criticism (my mother called him &quot;lazy&quot; when he didn&#39;t walk until 17 months). But this seems to be part of his process, and although I have not been a perfect parent in this regard, it is always best to trust him and his timetable, rather than push and create conflict and resentment.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou say you don&#39;t want to battle but want her to stop wearing diapers all the time. These could very well be incompatible goals, and the first one may be the only one you have any control over--you can choose not to battle over it. When she asks for a diaper, say &quot;sure&quot; and cheerfully help her with it. You can choose to remove diapers as a focus of conflict for you and her, and by doing that, remove any motivation she might have to control the situation by insisting on diapers or holding onto them longer than she might otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re concerned about diapers interfering with her understanding what&#39;s going on with her body, you might consider two possibilities: one is that she is perfectly aware but not ready to give up diapers for other reasons; the other is that developmentally that piece has not fallen into place for her yet. She&#39;s showing very plainly that she is not yet ready to give up diapers; you don&#39;t necessarily have to understand the reasons for that to respect it, and to trust that she will indeed give up diapers in her own good time.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I sound mellower about this kind of stuff in theory than I have often been in practice.

Why are you worried about it?<br/>\n<br/>\nI would guess, from a distance of some very many feet, that you are a little embarrassed to have a 5 year old in diapers. Breathe, and do what else you need to in order to understand that this is about her needs and not about yours. Simon was 4 when he quit wearing diapers, he probably would have worn them for longer, but we had bought all the diapers that fit him in all the shops within moped range of us in Kyoto. So, he went from diapers to no diapers in a day. I think he peed himself once during the day and a couple of times at night. He just preferred diapers. <br/>\n<br/>\nBoth Simon and Linnaea hated having their hair brushed. They went out with tangled, knotted, long, fine hair regularly. I would feel smaller when I thought others were criticizing my parenting for their lack of hair care. But they felt good and happy and didn&#39;t care. And the more that I thought about their good and happy and not caring, the less I thought about others&#39; censure of my parenting. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your daughter prefers diapers at 5, I imagine that at 15 she will feel more intact because you respected that, even while she isn&#39;t any longer wearing diapers. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Susan Fuerst &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fuerst@...\">fuerst@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Monday, 21 June, 2010 17:43:14<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] late diapering<br/>\n<br/>\nHi all,<br/>\n<br/>\nI am facing a strange (to me) situation.  I have a 5.5 yo dd who wants to wear diapers.  She appears completely traumatized when she doesn&#39;t have one (like when we run out).  I have asked that she get them off as soon as she &#39;goes&#39; in them so that she can keep herself clean.  I am concerned that she may increase her risk for UTI (urinary tract infection) by wearing them longer.  She refuses to go anywhere near a toilet for elimination, so I have said that she can use a diaper if she wants, but that she doesn&#39;t need to wear them all day long.  I thought ti would be simpler in summer because she will wear a swimsuit for water activities and she doesn&#39;t&#39; mind.  However, when remove her diaper in the morning, I have been saying she needs to leave it off for a while then if she still wants one at lunchtime, she can choose to.  However, she hasn&#39;t been able tell me when she goes (meaning she chooses not to, she does seem to know).  Of course, this sets her up<br/>\n to try to sneak and hide it from me, and that isn&#39;t good.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, she has defied the old wives tale that you won&#39;t see a child go off to kindergarten wearing diapers (well, maybe not since she won&#39;t be going to kindergartens, but age-wise she has passed that limit).<br/>\n<br/>\n  While I don&#39;t want to battle over this, I DO want her to stop wearing diapers all day long; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s healthy.
