Usually Simon is the one who uses them most. It gives him control of when he watches something that is somewhat removed from the rules of the house. It gives him a something to do when and if he withdraws to the bedroom. <br/>\n<br/>\nSomethings that really help is to get out of the house more. Find things going on where your relatives live that would be interesting to you and your family and invite anyone else to come along and go. See if there is a lego display going on at the local mall or a museum exhibit or a zoo or a botanic gardens or a cool park or whatever so that when you are there you are also out and about a lot. Bring new things to pull out in tense moments. Two player card games, so that he can be framed and buffered by engaging with you. <br/>\n<br/>\nInvite family to come to yours more often. Try not to go to theirs so much, maybe see if you can go when there are fewer people around so that it is less of a large group to deal with. Yesterday Linnaea and I went to a science museum that a home-ed group uses. It was very chaotic. She sat on a couch and read for some of the time. It helped her to deal with the noise and the activity and not knowing anyone in the group. When the planned activity began she was very engaged and enjoyed doing and playing. Up to that point she needed me with her or else she wanted something to withdraw into like the book. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.waynforth.blogspot.com\">http://www.waynforth.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n            Not freedom and choices at<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; other people&#39;s houses or at their jobs, because we don&#39;t control<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; those environments, but when they&#39;re in situations in which other<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; people&#39;s parents might be saying &quot;Sit still, be quiet, go to sleep<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; because it&#39;s 8:00&quot; and on and on, we don&#39;t do that.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***Okay, but what if your kids don&#39;t want to conform to the rules of the house?<br/>\nWe occasionally visit my family which all has very strict rules about TV watching.  It can only be turned on at night, last thing before bed.  Eli is used to having the TV on much of the time.  I think he really likes the TV on in large group situations.  It gives him a way to disconnect from the group.  He gets easily overwhelmed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe sometimes gets very distraught when he is not allowed to turn on the TV.  All my family lives out of state so we are there for at least a few days, up to two weeks.  There are other kids involved everywhere we go.  I get stuck in respecting the rules of the house, and helping Eli.  I can distract him with a book, or a walk, or something, and sometimes it works better than others.  <br/>\nStaying at a hotel is not an option for financial reasons and my family would not understand.  <br/>\nAmandaEli 7, Samuel 6<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

That&#39;s a long time with a lot of people for a 7-year-old who is<br/>\neasily <br/>\noverwhelmed. It would be too much for my dd at 13 and too much for me, frankly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve often limited the time spent at relatives for this reason, and as dd<br/>\ngets <br/>\nolder, she handles visiting much better. She always takes her DS and iPod for <br/>\nthose moments when she needs to retreat into another room. Sometimes, we go for<br/>\n<br/>\na walk. Or she watches TV in another room. Same stuff she does at unschooling <br/>\nconferences, actually!<br/>\n<br/>\n******<br/>\nWe live in Nashville, and my sister lives in Indiana.  So I drive up to her house and pick her up and we drive together to NJ where my parents live.  Since we leave home first and get home last, we end up being gone for the longest time.  We spend two to three days in transit each way.  Dh stays home to work and 15 hours is a long drive alone.  It is more expensive to fly, and we need the extra vehicles.  This year we got 6 day passes to Great Adventure which is only a few days from their house.  It really made the time go better.  And at Live and Learn we made friends in NJ, so that is something we are looking forward to next year.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On top of it all, I have the only boys.  The overwhelming energy they<br/>\nbring to <br/>\n&gt; gathering is unwelcome by my family.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, you still go? Do you feel unwelcome, too? I know it&#39;s once a year, but<br/>\n<br/>\ncould you stay fewer days? Or not go at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\nThis is tough.  Since we go so rarely it is hard to figure out what will work ahead of time.  A year&#39;s growth is a lot at this age.  At home we have trampolines in the the house, a chin-up bar, and hopefully this weekend we will have a set of rings.  The only quiet activity is Legos which don&#39;t travel well.  We just have too many.  My mom bought a small set at a garage sale, but it hardly compares to a house full.  Besides there is almost always baby and they are a choking hazard.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents have been foster parents for 34 years and in that time have had about 4 boys and 40 girls.  There is a clear preference for girls.  However, they do try.  They just don&#39;t understand how they can still run around the house after an hour at the park!!  I&#39;m not sure either!!  I&#39;m not sure that the boy&#39;s are aware of the preference.  My parents are always very fair gift wise, and the boys rarely seek their attention.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom seems much happier to see me than the kids for the most part.  She like having adults around.  And love playing cards and such.  After 34 years of foster parenting she does not really seek out the kids.  It can bother me if I think too much about it.  Mostly I just view it as strange and her loss.  <br/>\n*****<br/>\n<br/>\n &gt; They were not allowed to play smash <br/>\n&gt; brother on Wii when we where there because my boys got too excited.  It<br/>\ncaused <br/>\n&gt; loud laughter and lots of jumping around.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s too bad. I&#39;m guessing there&#39;s not usually a lot of loud<br/>\nlaughter or <br/>\njumping around going on in that house. Too bad for the kids who live there!<br/>\n<br/>\n****<br/>\nNo, that sort of play should be &quot;taken outdoors.&quot;  And the older girls are into the hang out and talk stage of teens and pre-teens.  Jumping, screaming and such can only be tolerated in  very small doses.  <br/>\n****<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Sometimes we all have a good time and sometimes we don&#39;t.  This year<br/>\ngot a <br/>\n&gt; little better as the boys were old enough to be outside alone.  My<br/>\nparents <br/>\nlive <br/>\n&gt; at the end of a culdasac with sidewalk.  Eli often escaped to ride his<br/>\nbike or <br/>\n&gt; scooter outside.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking, given the circumstances and the anti-boy-energy bias, I would<br/>\njoin <br/>\nmy 7- and 6- year-olds outside alone in a relatively unfamiliar place, even if <br/>\nit is grandma and grandpa&#39;s at the end of a cul de sac with a sidewalk!  It<br/>\n <br/>\nmight be a good time to connect with them, while they are getting some of their<br/>\n<br/>\nenergy out. <br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\nI do usually follow them as soon as I can, but this year Eli was able to open the door alone, which meant he was not stuck if I was busy.  Or if it got loud he could escape quickly.  And sometimes I would follow them out and they would ask to be alone.  I think being able to get out alone helped their autonomy.<br/>\n*****<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can even talk about what&#39;s going on in the house, in terms<br/>\nof <br/>\nthe house &quot;rules&quot; while not actually having to enforce them in the<br/>\nmoment.<br/>\n<br/>\n****<br/>\nThey really do well with most of it.  Food we work out by my kids eating something served, and also eating whatever else they like at odd times.  All the kids are on different night schedules so that is not too difficult.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is really the TV and computer that Eli has a hard time with.  Until very recently we only had one and my parents have 5 and yet he can&#39;t watch whenever he wants to.  There is also a Wii, gamecube and two computers.  I understand why it is so confusing.  And because he is the only one having such a hard time, it is hard to get the other parents to work with me.  They just want him to be happy playing with his cousins and a small box of Legos.  I wish he could be, but he just isn&#39;t.  It took me years to except that TV helps him deal with overly social situations.  I guess it is not hard to understand why they don&#39;t see it.  I guess at some point it will come down to a question of how much compromising they are willing to do for us to come.  And of course the whole situation is more difficult because they all feel I should punish him more for his outbursts. <br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like this sounds much worse than it is.  I might have to spend some time before next summer thinking about how bad it is.  It sounds terrible written out, but it only feels that bad a few times a visit.   <br/>\n*****<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWere you expected to stay in the house?<br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\nYES!!  It would be easier not to go than to stay in a hotel.  <br/>\n****<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;And they love being in the hot tub.  I am hoping as they get <br/>\n&gt; older they will understand better, and we only go once a year.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you want them to understand? That &quot;rules&quot; are different,<br/>\ndepending on <br/>\nwhose home it is? It&#39;s good to know. <br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\nYes, better able to understand why their cousins are not allowed to watch TV.  Why things are so different from home.  Eli tends to get &quot;stuck&quot; when he wants something.  It is very hard for him to change gears and do something else.  There are times he is more or less open to suggestions.  When he is not it can take me up to an hour to get him to even consider another idea.  <br/>\n****<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if they have trouble with it or<br/>\nare not <br/>\ngrasping the &quot;rules,&quot; perhaps waiting until they *can* better<br/>\nunderstand it <br/>\nwould be preferable.<br/>\n<br/>\n****<br/>\nHow do you not go?  They are excited about the trip when it comes up.  They talk a lot about the hot tub.  The like their cousin and aunts.  I keep hoping for a good reason to skip the trip, but they do enjoy a lot of it, and I like for them to know their family.  At least a little.<br/>\n****<br/>\n<br/>\nCould you invite your parents and foster kids to your house?  Get together in a<br/>\n<br/>\nneutral space?<br/>\n<br/>\n****<br/>\nThey have come here, but it has to be when they are not caring for any little ones.  Our house is not child proof and Eli gets very mad when little ones get into his stuff.  Add that to cat allergies (we have three) and they have not been here in about 2 years.  It is better when they come, but with 5 kids it can be tough for them to travel.  Sometimes we see them at my sister&#39;s in Indiana.  She has a slightly bigger house than us, no cats, and is a few hours closer to my parents.  That is easier because we can make our own schedule.  It is easier to plan a short trip, except my other sister can never make it.  She is a teacher and also teaches summer school.  <br/>\n<br/>\n****<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all things to think about.  I hope I don&#39;t sound too negative.  I think some of it all comes from me being the youngest child, it is hard to get out of that sometimes.  Also, since we homeschool and I stay home, we end up working around everyone else&#39;s schedule.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI need to talk to my boys and find some ways to get their needs met better.  I get so overwhelmed when we are there, I have trouble thinking.  Maybe if I come up with ideas ahead of time it would be easier to implement them.  My boys are such homebodies, it can be difficult to get them out without a good plan.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope my boys are not so conflicted about dh and me when they grow up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAmanda<br/>\nEli 7, Samuel 6<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"robin.bentley@comcast.net","from":"robin.bentley@...","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: control, choices, autonomy","postDate":"1226629337","msgId":40214,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExMTQyMDA4MDIyMi45OTUzLjQ5MUNFMEQ5MDAwRUUyMjYwMDAwMjZFMTIyMTY1NjYyNzY5NzBBMDQ5QjAyMEEwREQyMDIwNzBEMDE5REBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":40213,"nextInTopic":40215,"prevInTime":40213,"nextInTime":40215,"topicId":40181,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

As regards being the parent of my three  <br/>\nchildren, I&#39;m not &quot;autonomous&quot; in those decisions, because Keith is  <br/>\ntheir dad and he&#39;s right there.  But Keith and I decided together to  <br/>\nparent in gentle, progressive, counter-culture ways, and because we  <br/>\nhave the right to make a decision like that and the power to enforce  <br/>\nit, we decided that and so we control the environment.  We set it up,  <br/>\nwe protect and defend it, and we maintain it.

He expected  <br/>\nit.  He was going 45 in a 35, through a green light.  Not a capital  <br/>\ncrime.  Not a dangerous crime.  It was 2:45 in the morning and he was  <br/>\nthe only car in the intersection.   The ticket is in my name because  <br/>\nthe loan and title of his car are in my name until  he pays it off.   <br/>\nHe had the right and power and freedom to be out driving.  Does he  <br/>\nhave the right to ignore that ticket?  No, and he doesn&#39;t even want  <br/>\nto.  The friend he was taking to Las Cruces had already offered to  <br/>\npay for the ticket, but Marty won&#39;t press him to do that.  So who&#39;s  <br/>\nin charge?  Who&#39;s in control?   Nobody&#39;s needing to be in control.   <br/>\nThe stat is in control of what they&#39;ll do if we ignore this ticket.  <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;  First move is the price would go up to $100.
