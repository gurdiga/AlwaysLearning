She did the iron man in <br/>\nHawaii a few years back, but shattered her collar bone in a bike accident the <br/>\nfollowing year while preparing for some race in New Zealand for the <br/>\nmillennium.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s dedicated her life to her sport, so every break and pain is difficult <br/>\nfor her.  And she&#39;s been unsuccessful in having children, even after I tried <br/>\nto be a surrogate for her this fall.  That&#39;s another source of pain for her.  <br/>\nSo, complaining about my ankle (which seems to be my favorite sport) is <br/>\nridiculous in comparison.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think she&#39;s aspiring to be a 70 year old triathlete!  I admire her and you <br/>\nfor your training regimens...<br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"More broken bones","postDate":"1042472545","msgId":11691,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZlLjI4ZTU0ZWRlLjJiNTQzODYxQGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":11700,"prevInTime":11690,"nextInTime":11692,"topicId":11691,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/13/03 12:45:01 AM Central Standard Time, AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1777084906\">In a message dated 1/13/03 12:45:01 AM Central Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;   Plus, she&#39;s a triathlete (at almost <br/>\n 42!)  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAh, she&#39;s young still for a triathlete!!
