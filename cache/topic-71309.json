It doesn&#39;t change who wants to teach or how well they do when they get there, or whether the kids are having any better results.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur big scandal here was that when a district created benefits for teachers and schools to be rewarded, teachers started cheating with the tests to get better scores.  If a kid cheated he was in big trouble, from teachers who were cheating.    But people don&#39;t seem to be saying, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, the tests aren&#39;t worth so much anyway.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s possible that such scandals and spotlights will, eventually, bring more people to see learning as separate from school, or at least to see school  as more separate from normal life than some seem to see it.  It&#39;s not something that grew naturally and gradually.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMAYBE, I hope, it will happen before too many more developing countries copy  and adopt those same irritating school systems.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not about unschooling except that sometimes people say that maybe unschooling will change the schools.  Not much, and not fast, but maybe in the cracks created by their own instability, the fact that some people aren&#39;t in school at all and still grow up and get jobs and reproduce will be noticed.   Or not. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":550340738,"authorName":"Mette G.","from":"&quot;Mette G.&quot; &lt;busybee2386@...&gt;","profile":"busybee2386","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"society & the idea of school","postDate":"1367064093","msgId":71309,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNjcwNjQwOTMuNTMyNjguWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE2MjEwNC5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDE1NzAwNjIwLTNCN0ItNEY2OS1CQ0Q3LTY4QzcwMEIxMjk0MEBzYW4ucnIuY29tPiA8MzY4MjA4OTctNTg1Qy00OUNCLTlFQTAtMEY3ODkxMkUzODMwQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8QkxVMTczLURTNzExMzY1MEIwMDk5QTMzOTRDNURGQzRCNzBAcGh4LmdibD4g"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":71310,"prevInTime":71308,"nextInTime":71310,"topicId":71309,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t know if this has reached the news in the US and elsewhere, but we ve been having a rather unique situation here in Denmark over the last four weeks;","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-625762861\">I don&#39;t know if this has reached the news in the US and elsewhere, but we&#39;ve been having a rather unique situation here in Denmark over the last <br/>\nfour weeks; almost no kids in the country have been to school!<br/>\n<br/>\nInfact, there&#39;s <br/>\nbeen a conflict over workload and such between the teachers&#39; union and <br/>\nthe municipalities which employ them, and they ended up throwing a <br/>\nlock-out at the teachers.
