She<br/>\nused the rope to have her younger brother drag get across the hardwood<br/>\nfloors (knotted to make a loop which she was inside) as she was a baby<br/>\nand couldn&#39;t walk.  She also used the rope to connect her fort to her<br/>\nbrothers fort so that Lucy Little would be able to climb the rope<br/>\nbetween them if Lucy came out of the walls at night.

The hidden agenda of tying shoe laces lessons<br/>\n&gt; and many more &quot;life skills&quot; is all about effective classroom<br/>\n&gt; management. It is all about a Bigger Agenda, in the long run.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To me, it is here where the trouble starts- the authorities has used<br/>\n&gt; common life skills to disguise thier own &quot;classroom management&quot; needs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; By passing off a few more like dressing oneself and toilet needs, the<br/>\n&gt; authorities has effectively encroached and transferring upon themselves<br/>\n&gt; (as and when it suits them to do so, )a big part of a parent&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; responsibility as the nurturing and teaching adult.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This has lulled alot of today&#39;s parents into thinking that it is OK to<br/>\n&gt; relinquish such parenting responsibilities, and confidences that the<br/>\n&gt; state have more resources, and might possibly do a more effective job<br/>\n&gt; than them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It is very much about &quot;let the teacher tell my child what to do<br/>\n&gt; because my kids don&#39;t listen to me&quot;. We(as in unschoolers) all now<br/>\n&gt; know our children is capable of thier own mind and opinions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It is quite common to hear a grateful parent citing &quot;rather the<br/>\n&gt; teacher than me&quot; comment.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To me, this has created the &quot;easy parenting&quot; mentality. I have known<br/>\n&gt; many SAHM who see school not only as an educational method but also as<br/>\n&gt; a babysitting service, which is why they groan about school holidays.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It has also given some irresponsible parents the perfect excuse to<br/>\n&gt; wash thier hands off thier responsibilities towards thier kids very<br/>\n&gt; early on; enabling them to continue thier adult life as normal; and<br/>\n&gt; then to blame someone, by passing off thier kids&#39; bad behaviour as the<br/>\n&gt; school&#39;s failings, and never thiers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I always question &quot;Why have children when you cannot imagine loving<br/>\n&gt; being near them?&quot; Why have another when you clearly dont&#39; appreciate<br/>\n&gt; having the first one around you all the time? &quot;Why did they become<br/>\n&gt; mothers when they clearly prefer life without such &quot;perceived<br/>\n&gt; emcumbrances&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What were they expecting from motherhood?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This &quot;easy parenting&quot; is what they were expecting from motherhood. As<br/>\n&gt; such, they are only too happy to allow the school to take away more<br/>\n&gt; and more of thier parenting responsibilities, thus saving them the<br/>\n&gt; hassle of needing to do themselves.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In UK, this is how I see it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The state has effectively created a &quot;pass the bucket&quot; scenario between<br/>\n&gt; them and the parents, whereby nobody is taking responsibility towards<br/>\n&gt; the child. The state feels the parents need to do more for the child,<br/>\n&gt; and the parents feel the state is not doing enough for that huge<br/>\n&gt; amount of time the child is in school.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Which is why when one decides to educate their youngs on thier own,<br/>\n&gt; the public sees them as mad people, because the public is convinced<br/>\n&gt; that we could not possibly 1) enjoy being with our kids all the time<br/>\n&gt; (as alot of them clearly told me it&#39;ll drive them mad!LOL!) 2)we<br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t possibly handle the full responsibility and accountability<br/>\n&gt; towards our children well being.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Again, it&#39;s back to the &quot;there must be a very good reason why schools<br/>\n&gt; is teaching how to tie your shoes laces and wipe your own bum&quot; skills.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Because it all about &quot;mind control and moulding them from young&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Never mind that Velcro is the &quot;new shoe laces&quot; and cellophane tape is<br/>\n&gt; the new &quot;string&quot; to hold your postage package together; The keyboard<br/>\n&gt; is the new way to &quot;write&quot; your letter, and the spell check is the<br/>\n&gt; new &quot;way&quot; to learn correct spellings.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And that calculator is a blessing for those of us who is very<br/>\n&gt; impatient. I found using the calculator has enable me and son to<br/>\n&gt; continue on with our maths learning and solving many mathematical<br/>\n&gt; wonders without getting stuck, fretting and struggling thru<br/>\n&gt; multiplications and long divisions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So many new inventions created to help us humankinds to progress<br/>\n&gt; further and easier into our lives, promoting better and faster<br/>\n&gt; learning as we go along. So many fantastic inventions created to<br/>\n&gt; bridge our &quot;in-abilities&quot; whether it&#39;s temporary or for permanent, so<br/>\n&gt; that nothing stop us being able to progress further.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So indeed, the un-deniable truth is, there must be a VERY good and<br/>\n&gt; logical reason why school still insist on hanging onto old methods and<br/>\n&gt; not embracing the new, insisting that our children must know how to<br/>\n&gt; tie shoes laces irregardless shoes laces is on it&#39;s way out. Soon<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;ll be teaching how to have a bath, as they are already teaching<br/>\n&gt; how and what to eat, and how to &quot;sex education&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The question is Why, and Who, does this Reason serve.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; By the end of the day, we all know, no matter how they dress it up,<br/>\n&gt; whether it is life skills or mental skills, the bigger agenda is<br/>\n&gt; still that school is just a factory churning out future workforce<br/>\n&gt; drones, law abiding, never straying and uniformingly the same and<br/>\n&gt; predictable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My kid&#39;s a cellophane and Velcro tape kid LOL!!

We just believe <br/>\nit should be an everyday thing, and not just limited to weekends or <br/>\nholidays.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nInfact, time is no longer a concept to us because we wake when we <br/>\nwake, sleep when we sleep.

The <br/>\nonly time we observe time is when it&#39;s a doctor or dentist appt. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery food, is food. No disticntion needed. We can have cornflakes <br/>\nwith soft boiled egg for dinner, we have full Japanese hot rice and <br/>\ntofu and soup for breakfast and pancakes for lunch. Yesterday, we had <br/>\ncupcakes for dinner and curried rice for supper at 9pm. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may sounds lazy and irrresponsible to some, but really, it isn&#39;t.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s called living life to the fullest abd be happy.

But then <br/>\nthis has nothing to do with unschooling, I have always been a <br/>\nfashionista of some sort, i do appreciate lovely clothes and shoes and <br/>\nDS is beginning to show a preferance for his own sense of style.    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSome may classified me as ignorant or irresponsible or neglectful <br/>\nparent because of my obvious disregard to conventional parenting, with <br/>\nall it&#39;s rules and regulations. But to my perception, it is on <br/>\ncontrary to what they say. <br/>\n<br/>\nInfact, I am more responsible, more attentive, more informed and <br/>\nintuned with my son than I have ever been before.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, perhap they maybe right in thier perception of &quot;unschooling&quot; <br/>\nduring weekend and hoilidays only. In a sense that they could see the <br/>\njoy (and not necessary the long term benefits)of unschooling - the <br/>\nhappiness, freedom and the luxury of being just yourself and not <br/>\nhaving to measure up and do schedules. They seems to understand the <br/>\nbeneficial properties of such living and feeling, which is why they <br/>\nare using it to re-cuperate and re-juvenate from thier stressful <br/>\neveryday lives.   <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I just can&#39;t imagine how they can justify it&#39;s responsible <br/>\nparenting and love, when they are teaching their children to only be <br/>\nhappy, only be comfortable being themselves, and accept and understand <br/>\nthat parents are only happy and comfortable being with them, ONLY <br/>\nduring weekends and holidays.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can they justify it as positive parenting, when they teach thier <br/>\nchildren to fear that the very core of the themselves is not good <br/>\nenough. That the child need to work hard put to aside thier instinct <br/>\nand desires, to concentrate on stuff like lessons, and schedules and <br/>\nstaying on the grades, in order to justify thier worthiness and <br/>\nusefulness. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo perhaps, they do see the goodness of unschooling, which is learning <br/>\nwithout structure but thru living life as it is. They just don&#39;t <br/>\nbelieve it is good enough on it&#39;s own, which is why they are using it <br/>\nto supplement thier already full and structured weekday homeschooling <br/>\nlearnings. To how they see it, the learning still continues, on the <br/>\nweekend and holidays. They are just learning &quot;non relevant, non <br/>\nimportant, non academic&quot; stuff, according to thier perspective.   <br/>\n  <br/>\nTo me, this is the most important and the very basis of everything to <br/>\ncome. Academics is just an in-evitable by-product of our unschooling. <br/>\n <br/>\nBest Wishes<br/>\nSharonBugs. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":357843301,"authorName":"lyeping2008","from":"&quot;lyeping2008&quot; &lt;lyeping2008@...&gt;","profile":"lyeping2008","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: But you&#39;re *not* an unschooler!

The argument for it is that tying <br/>\nshoes is good small motor skills practice.<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa and Ed, very true. The hidden agenda of tying shoe laces lessons <br/>\nand many more &quot;life skills&quot; is all about effective classroom <br/>\nmanagement. It is all about a Bigger Agenda, in the long run. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, it is here where the trouble starts- the authorities has used  <br/>\ncommon life skills to disguise thier own &quot;classroom management&quot; needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy passing off a few more like dressing oneself and toilet needs, the <br/>\nauthorities has effectively encroached and transferring upon themselves<br/>\n(as and when it suits them to do so, )a big part of a parent&#39;s <br/>\nresponsibility as the nurturing and teaching adult.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis has lulled alot of today&#39;s parents into thinking that it is OK to <br/>\nrelinquish such parenting responsibilities, and confidences that the <br/>\nstate have more resources, and might possibly do a more effective job <br/>\nthan them. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is very much about &quot;let the teacher tell my child what to do <br/>\nbecause my kids don&#39;t listen to me&quot;. We(as in unschoolers) all now <br/>\nknow our children is capable of thier own mind and opinions. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is quite common to hear a grateful parent citing &quot;rather the <br/>\nteacher than me&quot; comment. <br/>\n  <br/>\nTo me, this has created the &quot;easy parenting&quot; mentality. I have known <br/>\nmany SAHM who see school not only as an educational method but also as <br/>\na babysitting service, which is why they groan about school holidays.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt has also given some irresponsible parents the perfect excuse to <br/>\nwash thier hands off thier responsibilities towards thier kids very <br/>\nearly on; enabling them to continue thier adult life as normal; and <br/>\nthen to blame someone, by passing off thier kids&#39; bad behaviour as the <br/>\nschool&#39;s failings, and never thiers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI always question &quot;Why have children when you cannot imagine loving <br/>\nbeing near them?&quot; Why have another when you clearly dont&#39; appreciate <br/>\nhaving the first one around you all the time? &quot;Why did they become <br/>\nmothers when they clearly prefer life without such &quot;perceived <br/>\nemcumbrances&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat were they expecting from motherhood? <br/>\n<br/>\nThis &quot;easy parenting&quot; is what they were expecting from motherhood. As <br/>\nsuch, they are only too happy to allow the school to take away more <br/>\nand more of thier parenting responsibilities, thus saving them the <br/>\nhassle of needing to do themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn UK, this is how I see it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe state has effectively created a &quot;pass the bucket&quot; scenario between <br/>\nthem and the parents, whereby nobody is taking responsibility towards <br/>\nthe child. The state feels the parents need to do more for the child, <br/>\nand the parents feel the state is not doing enough for that huge  <br/>\namount of time the child is in school. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is why when one decides to educate their youngs on thier own, <br/>\nthe public sees them as mad people, because the public is convinced <br/>\nthat we could not possibly 1) enjoy being with our kids all the time <br/>\n(as alot of them clearly told me it&#39;ll drive them mad!LOL!) 2)we <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t possibly handle the full responsibility and accountability <br/>\ntowards our children well being. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, it&#39;s back to the &quot;there must be a very good reason why schools <br/>\nis teaching how to tie your shoes laces and wipe your own bum&quot; skills. <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause it all about &quot;mind control and moulding them from young&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNever mind that Velcro is the &quot;new shoe laces&quot; and cellophane tape is <br/>\nthe new &quot;string&quot; to hold your postage package together; The keyboard <br/>\nis the new way to &quot;write&quot; your letter, and the spell check is the <br/>\nnew &quot;way&quot; to learn correct spellings.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that calculator is a blessing for those of us who is very <br/>\nimpatient. I found using the calculator has enable me and son to <br/>\ncontinue on with our maths learning and solving many mathematical <br/>\nwonders without  getting stuck, fretting and struggling thru <br/>\nmultiplications and long divisions. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo many new inventions created to help us humankinds to progress <br/>\nfurther and easier into our lives, promoting better and faster <br/>\nlearning as we go along. So many fantastic inventions created to <br/>\nbridge our &quot;in-abilities&quot; whether it&#39;s temporary or for permanent, so <br/>\nthat nothing stop us being able to progress further.    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo indeed, the un-deniable truth is, there must be a VERY good and <br/>\nlogical reason why school still insist on hanging onto old methods and <br/>\nnot embracing the new, insisting that our children must know how to <br/>\ntie shoes laces irregardless shoes laces is on it&#39;s way out.  Soon <br/>\nthey&#39;ll be teaching how to have a bath, as they are already teaching <br/>\nhow and what to eat, and how to &quot;sex education&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe question is Why, and Who, does this Reason serve. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy the end of the day, we all know, no matter how they dress it up, <br/>\nwhether it is life skills or mental skills,  the bigger agenda is <br/>\nstill that school is just a factory churning out future workforce <br/>\ndrones, law abiding, never straying and uniformingly the same and <br/>\npredictable. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kid&#39;s a cellophane and Velcro tape kid LOL!! Perhap oneday, he <br/>\nmight get interested in finding out to tie a ribbon (maybe a <br/>\ngirlfriend might instigate this need? lol) or how his dad is so clever <br/>\nin doing that butcher&#39;s knot for mummy&#39;s roast pork joint, and maybe <br/>\nventure into knottings and ropes for a bit of kinky sex! But then <br/>\nmaybe not, maybe he&#39;ll stick to his Velcro and cellophane tape! LOL!!! <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kid&#39;s fine motor skills is fantastic, all thanks to the Lego <br/>\nCompany for it&#39;s little bricks; and Nintendo DS for it&#39;s little stylus <br/>\nand screen; that little screw driver to open up anything, for all his <br/>\ntoys requries constant batteries replacement.     <br/>\n<br/>\nOh my goodness LOL!!!

With this ultimate  <br/>\ngoal in mind, the teaching staff along with input from parents plans a  <br/>\ncurriculum that encourages curiosity, provides successful experiences  <br/>\nfor children and promotes social skills necessary to prepare them for  <br/>\nlater school experiences. The curriculum covers the following areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nCURRICULUM<br/>\nSelf-Help Skills: Children are encouraged to perform self-care  <br/>\nroutines and tasks for themselves such as: setting tables, serving  <br/>\nthemselves at the table, snapping, zipping, and buttoning their own  <br/>\nclothes, tying shoes, putting on own jackets, taking care of toileting  <br/>\nneeds, brushing teeth and cleaning up after play.<br/>\n***************<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, at the end of that page, they talk about assessment and they say:<br/>\n<br/>\n***************<br/>\nASSESSMENT<br/>\nEach child is assessed to identify their developmental strengths and  <br/>\nemerging skills. In order to plan an individualized learning program  <br/>\nof activities, teachers will meet with parents to discuss each child&#39;s  <br/>\nprogress and develop strategies to meet goals. A portfolio will be  <br/>\nused to collect samples of each child&#39;s work.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also assess children using the Child Outcomes and Results Profile.  <br/>\nInfant/Toddlers are assessed four times a year with this tool.  <br/>\nPreschool children are assessed three times a year.
