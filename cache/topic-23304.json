<br/>\n <br/>\nim not sure where im gong with this, other then reaching out for a little reassurance, maybe someone else in a similiar situation...it just is so saddening to me that this way of life that i feel in my heart is right, is not coming as naturally as is seems for others. i feel so consumed by his behaviour,and trying to figure out what the best approach is, and then my fiance wanting to send him off to his room and every once in a great while spank him, and the total disagreement betweent the two of us as to how to handle it whan noah for e.g stomps on the dogs tail and replies that he did it because he wanted to that i may not be &quot;doing enough&quot; as far as providing a enviroment for him to learn.honestly there are entire days i dont even get to do a puzzle or play with him. its hard to take him and his sister out by myself, like to the library bc it becomes a game of cat and mouse... im talking books on the floor, kids left and right. my freind and a homeschooler (very curriculum<br/>\n oriented) said to me that homeschooling is great, unschooling sounds wonderful to her she says &quot;in theory&quot; , but maybe neither is for me. i wanted to cry! <br/>\ni found myself AP before i knew who Dr. Sears was. 5 years later, i have been a waterbithin, sling wearin, extened nursing, non vaxing, mama, always able to folloew my instincts... until now. with my complete exaperation and having little patience, and my conventional fiance who is always by my side, for the most part quitely supporting my decisions im could really use some advice!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

Luckily there <br/>\nare alternatives and you were probably going there anyway.   There are fine <br/>\neducational toys to be found at the hardware store, sporting goods store, auto <br/>\nparts store, and even grocery stores, but people usually go there with a <br/>\nmission and forget to browse.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I should correct what I said above.   They&#39;re not toys.   A real tape <br/>\nmeasure, a length of cotton rope, a disposable flashlight, a plastic wide-angle <br/>\n(fish-eye) lens or convex “spot” mirror-you can&#39;t even GET these things at <br/>\ntoy stores or educational supply houses.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the warning:   If you&#39;re not sure what&#39;s “age appropriate,” you might <br/>\npossibly get something that&#39;s too difficult to manipulate or technically <br/>\nunsafe.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the reminder: Lots of those age recommendations are based on <br/>\nfrustration levels and what&#39;s “appropriate” in school-year terms.   When you&#39;re buying <br/>\nfor a child you know well, you don&#39;t need to live by those manufacturer&#39;s <br/>\nrecommendations.   For a child whose skills and surroundings are less familiar to <br/>\nyou, avoid sharp, heavy, and small-enough-to-swallow.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to introduce the concept of   “simple tools,” you could get a <br/>\nposter and some little models, or you could go buy a big nut and bolt, a claw <br/>\nhammer and some nails (nail removal is a great leverage lesson) . . . well, you <br/>\nget the idea.   Storage ideas for kids:   <br/>\n<br/>\ntool boxes<br/>\ntackle boxes<br/>\nparts drawers<br/>\ncanvas buckets<br/>\nhooks <br/>\n(designed for tools <br/>\nbut could be used for sports equipment)<br/>\n<br/>\nKids could use these things for art supplies, Lego, Barbie accessories, <br/>\nlittle cars, miniature action figures, rock collections-who knows what?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd “who knows what” is a good   motto for shopping in odd places.   If you <br/>\ngo looking for a tool box that doubles as a stepping stool and seat, you might <br/>\nnot find that.   If you go looking for something neat the kid in your life <br/>\nwould love, you mcould easily find the PERFECT gift but it might not be <br/>\nsomething you&#39;d ever considered buying as a gift for a child.   Indoor/Outdoor <br/>\nthermometers.   Wrenches and a bike repair book.   Big nuts and bolts and the wrench <br/>\nto match them.   Plastic magnifying sheets from office supply stores.   A <br/>\nlong-reach stapler to make booklets.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some great commercial toys, but there are some that so many other <br/>\nkids also have that they become background.   If you think back to your own <br/>\nchildhood, there were probably a couple of special possessions you still remember <br/>\nor still have.   Be flexible and open in your search for gifts, and consider <br/>\ncombining several things into one “kit” or “gift basket.”   A magnifying <br/>\nglass and a compartmented box could be a rock or bug colle cting kit.   A <br/>\nflashlight, mirror and some colored lens covers could be an optical physics kit.   I <br/>\ncan&#39;t predict what you&#39;ll find that kids might love, but I can predict that if <br/>\nyou forget to consider “non standard” sources for children&#39;s gifts they&#39;ll <br/>\nmiss out on some memorable treasures!<br/>\n<br/>\nEnchanted Families Newsmagazine, Family Learning Network, December/January <br/>\n1998<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] self doubt","postDate":"1131236753","msgId":23314,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE1QzlEQkY1LTY2MjEtNEIzNC04RjRCLTdEMjU0NEUxNTdEQkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRraHYwNys0ZG85QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGRraHYwNys0ZG85QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":23313,"nextInTopic":23315,"prevInTime":23313,"nextInTime":23315,"topicId":23304,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We used to have a really good educational supply store near us - and it was one of our favorite places to go when my kids were younger.
