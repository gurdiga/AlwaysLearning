And this is damaging to a  <br/>\nchild whether he is the better one or the deficient one. And it is  <br/>\ndamaging to our relationships with our kids if we&#39;re thinking in  <br/>\nthese terms even in subtle ways. Or so it seems to me.**<br/>\n<br/>\nI really liked the way you explained this, Su.  I was really reading your whole post with enthusiasm.<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line for me, is that I think it can be positive if we compare a child, with himself at an earlier age, and feel excited about new skills.  But comparisons with others or with a benchmark seem to stir up unpleasant feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25376,"nextTopicId":9825}}
