I know only a handful of amicable divorces where the<br/>\nkids are happy with both parents and well cared for.  I don&#39;t know any<br/>\nantagonistic divorces with happy kids and intact family connections.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne friend has a family of 5 and had divorced in the early 90s.  Then<br/>\nshe had a catastrophic car wreck ... which made it extremely difficult<br/>\nto continue homeschooling (very relaxed eclectic with unschooly<br/>\nparenting style).  After the youngest were older, the children finally<br/>\nwent to school to ease things for their mother who has major spinal<br/>\ninjuries.  The whole time, some kids lived with their mom and others<br/>\nlived 3 houses down with their dad.  They had perfect freedom to be<br/>\nwith either parent at anytime.  I would say their family remains<br/>\nlargely intact despite the divorce.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost divorces aren&#39;t anything like that but are rageful and<br/>\ndestructive --- antagonistic.  I do think it&#39;s worth it try one&#39;s<br/>\nutmost to make as much peace as can possibly be had.  Our divorce<br/>\nstarted out very badly.  I was not at all assured that Brian could be<br/>\ncalmed or reasoned with.  Now we&#39;re back together, working things out.<br/>\n There was infidelity involved too, not wonderful, not the end of the<br/>\nworld, something we both learned a lot from (not a recommended path<br/>\nthough).<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s up to a friend to guide another into doing their<br/>\nutmost to make peace.  Some people just can&#39;t imagine or can&#39;t go<br/>\nthere, so they don&#39;t.  The example of my friend&#39;s amicable divorce<br/>\nyears and years ago was very helpful to me once things went bad<br/>\nbetween me and Brian.  She and I talked a good bit about how to<br/>\nimprove our situation.
