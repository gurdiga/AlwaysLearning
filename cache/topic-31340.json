I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1746123890\">Hello all. I have been lurking a little while. I have a 5 month old <br/>\ndaughter whom I plan to homeschool, and I am leaning more and more <br/>\ntowards unschooling. I taught in public & private schools for 5 years <br/>\nbefore quitting for a variety of reasons. I&#39;m not even going to try <br/>\nto say anything else about that right now, since my last placement <br/>\nleft me pretty bitter. <br/>\n<br/>\nI just read an awesome new book that I had to tell you folks about. <br/>\nIt&#39;s called Identical Strangers: A Memoir of Twins Separated and <br/>\nReunited. In addition to telling their story, Elyse Schein and Paula <br/>\nBernstein talk about other twins who were separated as babies. One <br/>\npair of men were both obsessively clean. One attributed it to growing <br/>\nup with his birth mother, who was like that too, and the other <br/>\nthought it was in reaction to having a mom who was a slob. When <br/>\nquestioned about the eating habits of another pair when they were <br/>\nstill preschool age, one adoptive mom said the kid was an awful <br/>\neater, and would only eat things that had cinnamon on them. The <br/>\nadoptive mom of the other twin said that her daughter was a wonderful <br/>\neater, and would eat absolutely anything as long as she put cinnamon <br/>\non it! It blows my mind that a little quirk that specific would be <br/>\ngenetic.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs horribly sad and wrong as it was that these children were <br/>\nseparated, this is such amazing information to have. It just goes to <br/>\nshow you how very much our babies are their own little people the <br/>\nmoment they are born. Of course I want my baby to eat lots of things <br/>\nand be neat and clean, etc etc. But knowing how very, very strong her <br/>\ninborn preferences and tendencies are, I feel like it is my <br/>\nresponsibility to work with her within her comfort zone instead of <br/>\ntrying to change her completely. I want to be the &quot;She&#39;ll eat <br/>\nanything, as long as it has cinnamon on it&quot; mom. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for letting me listen to all your conversations, as I&#39;m <br/>\nlearning a lot. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlex<br/>\nmom to Katya, 5 mos</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30520,"nextTopicId":31291}}
