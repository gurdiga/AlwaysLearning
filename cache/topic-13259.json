Maybe <br/>\nthose that get the teeth late are usually late readers, but I think there are <br/>\nplenty of other kids that are late readers too.<br/>\nJared is a very dreamy type of person. Quiet and calm most of the time and <br/>\nVERY distractable. He would probably have been labeled ADD in school just <br/>\nbecause he isn&#39;t going to focus on anything he doesn&#39;t have intense interest <br/>\nin (what a smart guy!) which is mainly video games and art right now.<br/>\nHe draws amazingly well and thinks mathematically quite well. (Picked up <br/>\nchess easy, memorizes symbols easily, plays with large numbers in his head <br/>\netc...)<br/>\nBut reading just wasn&#39;t important. The only time he wanted to read was when <br/>\nsomeone would give him a hard time, I knew this wasn&#39;t enough of a motivation <br/>\nsince shame and guilt weren&#39;t part of his life. Even when I did a more <br/>\neclectic approach, I didn&#39;t worry about having a late reader. So he escaped <br/>\nmost of the torture of being &quot;schooled&quot;.<br/>\nAnyhoo, he&#39;ll be 10 in August and he is just starting to sound out words on <br/>\nhis game.<br/>\nIt is exciting him to see he can do it.<br/>\nMy few stabs at showing him letter sounds was totally boring to him and I <br/>\njust figured he had his own way of figuring this all out and left him alone.<br/>\nWell, he DID have a better way for him.<br/>\nAnd now I get to watch him explore the world of language on his own terms.<br/>\nVery cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>\ngrowing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>\nmagic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>\nme....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n                                    ----Frances Hodgson Burnett</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13232,"nextTopicId":13277}}
