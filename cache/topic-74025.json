If you are within range and can afford it, DO THIS.  I won&#39;t be travelling as much as I have been for long.  I want to do that one in Albuquerque in December, and let people come to me, more. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just back from Australia where there were four gatherings—three ALLive events (based on the Always Learning group) and one organized locally for just anyone.  The difference is profound.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would rather speak to a small group of people who have read here for a while and really want to understand more than a big group (or any sized group) of baffled folks, or skeptics, or people who come in as though I&#39;m running a sales meeting and they can obtain unschooling in one weekend.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not trying to harsh, I&#39;m trying to be encouraging of people who DO want to understand unschooling to consider the value of an in-person experience where you can meet other unschooling families.  Some might just be the good or bad examples of a day or two.  Some might be your friends for life.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMay 29-June 1, 2014, Alex Polikowsky, Pam Laricchia and myself will be there to tell stories, share ideas and experiences, and answer questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you think you might attend, make a hotel reservation (and remember to cancel it if you can&#39;t get there).  More details are at the link below:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://minnesotaallive2014.blogspot.com\">http://minnesotaallive2014.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t like for this discussion to carry announcements that are essentially local, but when I do a symposium called &quot;Always Learning Live,&quot; it IS about this discussion. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe richest parts of the Australian gatherings were when people who ARE familiar with this discussion asked questions.  Beginning at that level, the information soared.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be two more this year, after Minnesota:  Maine in September, and New Mexico in late December.  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://speakingsandradodd.blogspot.com\">http://speakingsandradodd.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe Minnesota event is soon, though, and nearer to very many of you than those other two are, so don&#39;t let it slip by if you need it and can get there.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74011,"nextTopicId":73994}}
