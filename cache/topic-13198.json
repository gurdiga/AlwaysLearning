She realized that she didn&#39;t want me to put her <br/>\ndown and stopped.  I also said &quot;no teeth&quot; which she used as a toddler to <br/>\nremind herself not to use her teeth when nursing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Janene the first time she gummed (but with a tooth coming through) <br/>\nI yelled and put her down and she didn&#39;t nurse for 13 days.  She was <br/>\nyoung, no solids yet, a low weight baby who was a premie and who didn&#39;t <br/>\nhave any other source of nutrition so not nursing for almost 2 weeks was <br/>\nnot good.  She wouldn&#39;t take a bottle, or take milk in a spoon, syringe, <br/>\nor any other container.  During that time I was able to nurse her if she <br/>\nwas asleep but it was a constant battle.  It was even worse that I knew <br/>\nI had caused this nursing strike by my yell and I felt that she was <br/>\nafraid to hurt me again.  She&#39;s a very sensitive child.  Finally (and I <br/>\nknow this sounds strange) I had a long talk with her, told her I forgave <br/>\nher for biting me, and that it was very important that she nurse again <br/>\nand that it was OK if she bit me again and that we would just learn how <br/>\nnot to bite together.  She latched right on and never had another bit of <br/>\ntrouble (not nursing) although she did bit me a few more times.  But <br/>\nwith her I would just gently say &quot; no teeth, please.&quot; and as a toddler <br/>\nshe too would, when going to latch on, say right before &quot;no teeth&quot; to <br/>\nremind herself.  I&#39;ve known other moms with very high need and sensitive <br/>\nbabies who the automatic yell caused more problems then they fixed, <br/>\noften with a nursing strike.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI should say that both girls bit so hard the first time that I have a <br/>\nscar, one on each nipple, one for each child.  But both of them went on <br/>\nto nurse much longer than is average for our society--well anything <br/>\nlonger than six weeks is longer in this society,but they were well past <br/>\ntoddlerhood.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\nKate Green wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;  Should I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;put on my LLL Leader hat and tell you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Or do you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;know all that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;already?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Joylyn<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Think I&#39;m OK (BTDT plenty of times:) but I&#39;m always open to more ideas.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He just kept munching down and chewing with a vengence and it surprised me<br/>\n&gt; as I hadn&#39;t expected it quite so early yet.
