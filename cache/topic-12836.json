Cynthia&#39;s adamant that, though she <br/>\nsees the benefits, this child is 1) adopted, 2) Chinese (looks different), <br/>\nand 3) has two moms. She thinks that it&#39;s in Lizzie&#39;s best interest to have <br/>\n&quot;everything else&quot; as *normal* as possible because she&#39;s going to seem like an <br/>\noutsider enough already. She&#39;s in private school at $10,000/year. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn our own little world, Cameron LIKES being different, too. In a way, his <br/>\nfriends are terribly envious of his lifestyle, although they&#39;d never really <br/>\nWANT to leave their miserable school life because it&#39;s NORMAL. The friends <br/>\nhate their parents for being so strict or mean. Cam&#39;s SOOO happy we&#39;re his <br/>\nparents---we hear him say that all the time.
