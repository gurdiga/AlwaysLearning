That website has some good ones for older kids and adults - really lovely nature coloring books, geometric designs, mandalas, optical illusions. I recommend them to anyone who likes to play with color - as someone who likes to color, myself, and also as an artist. Despite alllllll my parents insistence that coloring was a waste of time, in retrospect I learned a lot of color theory and a whole lot about how value, shade and tone can suggest depth and movement in a two-dimensional work. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: preparing for college bound high school years","postDate":"1313873965","msgId":62446,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMTM4NzM5NjUuNTc2NDMuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyMjUxOS5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGoybWh0Mit2bWViQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PEY5QjJDNUVFLUY3NDAtNDg3MC05MkZFLTdFMTVDQzFFQkFFMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPGoybWh0Mit2bWViQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":62445,"nextInTopic":62449,"prevInTime":62445,"nextInTime":62447,"topicId":62427,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***History and literature are important to art.

I graduated from high school a year early, and had been shown &quot;back stage&quot; at school quite a bit, because they knew I was interested in teaching someday, and because of other factors.... I knew what was actually required by the state as opposed to what students were told.  When I was 18 and my sister was fifteen, she was on her way to the office to drop out of high school when the principle met her in the hallway and threw her out.  I figured out how to get her into a state university (not the one I was going to; another one).  She went a couple of quarters, met lots of boys from foreign countries, smoked a lot of dope, played music...   Cooler than most drop-outs were doing, I suppose.   But the point is that I (at 18) figured out how to get her (at 15/16), a dropout, into college.  And that was the 1970&#39;s.  Things are more lax now, because lots (and lots) of people have gone into college from all kinds of non-standard situations.  Older students are extremely common now.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn many ways, the best way to be great at college is NOT to &quot;be prepared,&quot; school-style, but to be interesting and interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting and interested doesn&#39;t come from a curriculum.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are grown.

She was talking yesterday about how cool it would be to have a shop someday to sell imports and art and gifts.  She was describing a kind of antiques/gallery shop.  I was having fun imagining the things she was describing.   She might take business classes and she might not.

And someone who isn&#39;t actually interested in biology in an everyday way (plants?  animals?  biochemistry?  &quot;biology&quot; is a huge range of &#39;interests&#39;--what is she actually interested in?) might only be picking biology as a pre-med degree.

Pay attention to what she&#39;s interested in this evening, or tomorrow, in the moment.  Someone might get really excited about horses one day--something they had never known before.  Some cool competition, training method, or a breed of horse that was designed and created within the last couple of hundred years.  It doesn&#39;t mean they want to abandon other interests, or to learn all about horses.  It might last ten minutes, or an hour, or a day, or a week.
