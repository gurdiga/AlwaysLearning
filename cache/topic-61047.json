Something about morality?=<br/>\n<br/>\nStar Wars Forced Unleashed II is coming to my mind.  Austin played through<br/>\nas a good guy and then played through as a bad guy to see what would<br/>\nhappen.  There is also a Spiderman game (Web of Shadows) where if Spiderman<br/>\ndoes too many disrupting things, like breaking windows or throwing cars, he<br/>\nwill turn into black Spiderman and everyone will run away from him.  In<br/>\nAssassin&#39;s Creed if Ezio kills a civilian or is busted pick pocketing his<br/>\nnotoriety goes up and it becomes harder to complete his mission.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are just some examples of games where you can experiment with being a<br/>\ngood guy and a bad guy that have been played here (Austin is 9).  Doing good<br/>\nthings vs. bad things, where the game will consider your actions and your<br/>\ncharacter will change accordingly.  There is an alignment system.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note, we didn&#39;t know this at first, but you can turn off the blood<br/>\nin Assassin&#39;s Creed which might make it a little more tolerable for kids who<br/>\nare sensitive to that.  This is Austin&#39;s most favorite game and we would<br/>\nhave missed out on all the awesomeness the game has brought into our house<br/>\nif we hadn&#39;t figured out that the blood could be turned off.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":61013,"nextTopicId":61005}}
