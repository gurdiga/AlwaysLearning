Joyce Reed, who was the associate dean at Brown University and the mother of 5 unschoolers (not in their 30ies & 40ies), wrote a book with David Albert about their unschooling experience. It&#39;s called What Really Matters. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Alan Thomas works at London University, Institute of Education and started with a dissatisfaction with the system, as a person who went through it and later as the parent of two children who also did (and didn&#39;t even say hello to each other in the school hallway b/c it wasn&#39;t done to talk to someone from another age group, so he thought, that&#39;s not very good socialization, which makes it think that it&#39;s quite ironic that socialization is often one of the first &quot;con&quot; people bring up.) He started with researching and writing books about general homeschooling and later met and fell in love with unschooling (which they call autonomous learning and which he sometimes calls informal learning), interviewing an spending time with hundreds of families in the UK & Australia. His work goes against everything he was taught about education, and his colleagues aren&#39;t always too happy about it! <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Leslie Barson is the publisher of a very helpful trilingual little book (English, German & French) called &quot;Learner-managed learning and home education: a European perspective&quot;. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m sure many of the families in the film are members of this group! I know for a fact that the friend who was the very first to plant the seed about unschooling for me, and appears as such in the film, is a member and a reader of this list, though not a poster. She&#39;s in Los Angeles. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t have a budget to shoot this so I ended filming wherever life took me. If my husband had a job in England, we would spend an extra 3 weeks there to meet people. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; In the resources, I have included books that are mentioned by the people in the film; books written by the people who are in the film; and books that I have personally read. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve missed tons of precious info. I&#39;ll be happy to keep reading (whenever my son is busy or asleep!) and adding to the resources. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; It sounds from your last three paragraphs (&quot;I couldn&#39;t get enough information from the synopsis to decide&quot;) like you haven&#39;t watched the trailer yet? <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please LMK if you have other questions after you do. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; What will people get from the movie? I hope it&#39;ll be helpful and reassuring to &quot;meet&quot; grown unschoolers and see how they &quot;turned out&quot;, which seems to be a concern for many people. To realize that there isn&#39;t a profile for unschooling families (hippies, or teachers, or crazy people!) I got some feedback from people who aren&#39;t ready to take their children out of school yet because of their circumstances but will now trust their children and their own guts more, esp. when they&#39;re pressured by the system. The people in the film have given so much and it is so dense that it seems that the audience members get what they need at the moment they&#39;re watching, which will be different from the person next to them, and are touched by different families and stories. There was a private screening in LA for friends and people who are in it. Maybe members of this group who were there can answer your question with more objectivity. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I meant spreading the &quot;word&quot; of course, and that&#39;s mostly meant for places like my country, France, where homeschooling is legal but most people don&#39;t even know it is (so never mind unschooling!), my husband&#39;s country, Brazil, & my mother&#39;s country, two countries where homeschooling is still illegal. AndrÃ© Stern, a grown unschooler featured in the film, is a stringed instrument maker and also the writer of a bestseller in Germany called &quot;And I never went to school&quot; (it&#39;s available both in German & French but not yet in English.)

Joyce Reed, who was the associate dean at Brown University and the mother of 5 unschoolers (not in their 30ies & 40ies), wrote a book with David Albert about their unschooling experience. It&#39;s called What Really Matters. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlan Thomas works at London University, Institute of Education and started with a dissatisfaction with the system, as a person who went through it and later as the parent of two children who also did (and didn&#39;t even say hello to each other in the school hallway b/c it wasn&#39;t done to talk to someone from another age group, so he thought, that&#39;s not very good socialization, which makes it think that it&#39;s quite ironic that socialization is often one of the first &quot;con&quot; people bring up.) He started with researching and writing books about general homeschooling and later met and fell in love with unschooling (which they call autonomous learning and which he sometimes calls informal learning), interviewing an spending time with hundreds of families in the UK & Australia. His work goes against everything he was taught about education, and his colleagues aren&#39;t always too happy about it! <br/>\n<br/>\nLeslie Barson is the publisher of a very helpful trilingual little book (English, German & French) called &quot;Learner-managed learning and home education: a European perspective&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure many of the families in the film are members of this group! I know for a fact that the friend who was the very first to plant the seed about unschooling for me, and appears as such in the film, is a member and a reader of this list, though not a poster. She&#39;s in Los Angeles. <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t have a budget to shoot this so I ended filming wherever life took me. If my husband had a job in England, we would spend an extra 3 weeks there to meet people. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the resources, I have included books that are mentioned by the people in the film; books written by the people who are in the film; and books that I have personally read. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve missed tons of precious info. I&#39;ll be happy to keep reading (whenever my son is busy or asleep!) and adding to the resources. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds from your last three paragraphs (&quot;I couldn&#39;t get enough information from the synopsis to decide&quot;) like you haven&#39;t watched the trailer yet? <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease LMK if you have other questions after you do. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat will people get from the movie? I hope it&#39;ll be helpful and reassuring to &quot;meet&quot; grown unschoolers and see how they &quot;turned out&quot;, which seems to be a concern for many people. To realize that there isn&#39;t a profile for unschooling families (hippies, or teachers, or crazy people!) I got some feedback from people who aren&#39;t ready to take their children out of school yet because of their circumstances but will now trust their children and their own guts more, esp. when they&#39;re pressured by the system. The people in the film have given so much and it is so dense that it seems that the audience members get what they need at the moment they&#39;re watching, which will be different from the person next to them, and are touched by different families and stories. There was a private screening in LA for friends and people who are in it. Maybe members of this group who were there can answer your question with more objectivity. <br/>\n<br/>\nI meant spreading the &quot;word&quot; of course, and that&#39;s mostly meant for places like my country, France, where homeschooling is legal but most people don&#39;t even know it is (so never mind unschooling!), my husband&#39;s country, Brazil, & my mother&#39;s country, two countries where homeschooling is still illegal. André Stern, a grown unschooler featured in the film, is a stringed instrument maker and also the writer of a bestseller in Germany called &quot;And I never went to school&quot; (it&#39;s available both in German & French but not yet in English.) He&#39;s hoping that his book and this film can help make things easier for families in those countries. <br/>\n<br/>\nFYI, I send Sandra and Joyce the website and asked them for permission before posting, because I wasn&#39;t sure if it was appropriate to share it on the list. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this is helpful! <br/>\n<br/>\nBest, <br/>\nClara <br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, robin.bentley@... wrote: <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Clara, I&#39;ve been an unschooling parent for 11 years now in two countries and the only names familiar to me in the film itself are John Taylor Gatto and Naomi Aldort, neither of whom I think of as radical unschoolers (or even unschoolers, in the case of Gatto). <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Did you consider talking to the regular contributors on this list for your film?

Those are presented and discussed in Sandra Dodd&#39;s books, on Joyce Fetterol&#39;s website, and in Pam Sorooshian&#39;s writings to name only three. Why weren&#39;t they included? -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of books and nobody ever has included all of them.  I don&#39;t think the filmmaker should be grilled about what she might have done differently.  There is not a better film out there.  Artists can do what they want to do!!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-&quot;Spreading the work of unschooling&quot; is done on this list and on similar Facebook pages and groups all the time (although I dislike the proselytizing that that phrase conveys). I&#39;d like to know more about what type of &quot;work&quot; you are speaking of in this film. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t the only place.  It might be the best. :-)  But it&#39;s also more serious than most people new to unschooling want or need.  I don&#39;t think inttroducing curious folks to this list or to The Big Book of Unschooling is a good move.  There are other, more beginner-friendly things.   Pam Laricchia&#39;s new book is great for that.  This film might be, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I&#39;m curious and nosey and discerning about what information I give to people about unschooling. Not everything is brilliant or helpful or even correct. I&#39;m hoping I can recommend your film. Thanks for humoring me :-). -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople who want information about unschooling will find it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope people who have never heard of it, or who have heard harsh and harmful things about it might see a film like this, in Germany, perhaps, and change their minds about home education.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a lot of families in Europe who don&#39;t have the option to take their children out of school just because they want to.  Germany, the Netherlands (where they need almost a religious exemption, and kids who have never been to school), Sweden...<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"robin.bentley@comcast.net","from":"robin.bentley@...","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Being and Becoming, a film about unschooling","postDate":"1345160639","msgId":68623,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExMzI5MjMzNzMuNjM1MDU5LjEzNDUxNjA2Mzk1NzUuSmF2YU1haWwucm9vdEBzejAxNDNhLmVtZXJ5dmlsbGUuY2EubWFpbC5jb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGswam1tbStxMDZsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68622,"nextInTopic":68625,"prevInTime":68622,"nextInTime":68624,"topicId":68620,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Clara, I ve been an unschooling parent for 11 years now in two countries and the only names familiar to me in the film itself are John Taylor Gatto and Naomi","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-817439412\">Clara, I&#39;ve been an unschooling parent for 11 years now in two countries and the only names familiar to me in the film itself are John Taylor Gatto and Naomi Aldort, neither of whom I think of as radical unschoolers (or even unschoolers, in the case of Gatto). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDid you consider talking to the regular contributors on this list for your film?
