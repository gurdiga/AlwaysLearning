Be trash or watching cartoon!<br>I remember when I did not like the Thomas the Train videos or Dora&#39;s voice. I made the effort!&nbsp; I now love and miss watching Thomas with my son sitting on my lap and even have very found memories of Dora !!! Get over it I say.&nbsp; Be really open to it. Take a change. Even the cartoons I never cared that much for I still know enough about them to get the jokes and references!<br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><br>Second it was Sandra that wrote in a link a little list of some of the things I have done in my life for work and there are many very different things.</div><div style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\">My parents\n embraced anything we were interested in.
