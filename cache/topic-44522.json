they just don&#39;t know it.<br/>\n<br/>\ni&#39;d really like to stop at kindergarten &#39;graduation&#39; in june & unschool her from thereon. i regret sending her to school but at the time i felt so helpless and hopeless as i was suffering from such depression that i just needed the relief and wanted the healthiest most nurturing environment for her with some nice wholesome-as-possible children to play with and be friends with.<br/>\n<br/>\ni am considering not re-enrolling megh for first grade. for many reasons...the biggest is of course, that i really want us as a whole to live as an unschooling family. megh is torn because she really loves so much about this school... but i feel she is too young to make that decison for herself. if she were older and could comprehend the choices available to her i&#39;d let her choose to stay or go. i figure i better stop this train before she gets even deeper in being schooled. i want sooo much more for my children... i think she is young enough still to be deschooled by living the unschooled life... i told her she can still have the same friends she&#39;s friends with from school as long as its reciprocated & that she will make even more friends of various sorts as we journy thru life...<br/>\n<br/>\nso. while i value & really appreciate your input to me on my RUN blog, sandra...i do think i&#39;m going to end the schooling for my daughter as of graduation. as long as she goes thru the summer ok w/ this i&#39;ll just flow w/ it... if she has a hard time w/ this decision i will re-enroll her or wait for her to be accepted into our local magnet school she&#39;s been on a waiting list for (its more of a democratic/free school type).  i guess i&#39;ve made my decision. to trust my heart as my children&#39;s mother and also to trust theirs...i will give it a few months and see what unfolds for us... <br/>\n<br/>\none great thing in our lives is that we live at a resort. at the pool, mainly, we meet so many different families thruout the summer...some of which used to unschool & some who are more waldorf-y or who are more curriculum/christian homeschoolers.  so it really is kind of an unschooly environment here. there are even horses to ride (for a fee of course) here in the summer...<br/>\n<br/>\ni just thought maybe i&#39;d post my situation for those of you who are in the same boat of some sort...   <br/>\n<br/>\nas i type, some of the lyrics to the songs playing on our CD&#39;s remind me of living a free life...living, loving, learning... :O) not necessarily only literally but so symbolically as well...<br/>\n<br/>\n-lis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;i want you to dance naked...so i can see you...i want you to dance naked...spin around and &#39;round...spin around and &#39;round...i want you to dance naked...if you want, i&#39;ll join you...spin &#39;round and you...&quot; <br/>\n-john mellencamp<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;stop this train...i want to get off...and go home again...&quot; <br/>\n-john mayer</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44470,"nextTopicId":44547}}
