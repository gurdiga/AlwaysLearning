My daughter seems to like learning about emotions and social conventions (the way people treat other people, in obvious and not so obvious situations).  She&#39;s just turned five years old.  We have a couple books from my mother-in-law of this sort, which I initially didn&#39;t think were very useful... but my daughter refers back to their terminology sometimes when she&#39;s examining a social situation (for example: &quot;filling buckets&quot; is helping someone to feel good).   <br/>\n<br/>\nAre there any good book recommendations for this age category that are about on managing anger/fustration, and/or anxiety?  For her, ideally they would involve a narrative with lots of pictures.  She hasn&#39;t been able to go along with very much of what I&#39;ve tried to show her, about deep breathing (filling the balloons, or blowing out imaginary bubbles, etc... in a playful way during happy times), but really loves Kai-Lan and Dora narratives, which tend to revolve a lot around how kid/characters interact and help each other out emotionally.
