And there were so many great things to choose from!  Truth was, too many. Our pace picked up to a level that was irritating me and at least one of the kids on any given day.  I could have saved a lot of screaming-ugly-mommy-moments if I had simply realized that my kids were having a great life without some of those activities. It&#39;s hard because as a mom, I wanted them to have access to everything wonderful. But the price was sometimes sacrificing the peaceful homelife - and that&#39;s too high of a price.  I needed to bring the pace down a notch for all involved.  Less outside activities... I think that might be the answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut...  thinking about the &quot;can&#39;t find the shoes&quot; thing. I still have that crisis. Often, it&#39;s projection on my part. I&#39;m a crummy housekeeper and I get mad at them because *their* room is a mess and they can&#39;t find anything. How bad is THAT???  Planning ahead helps. Laying stuff out. And, unfortunately, so does cleaning the dang house so we can all find stuff more easily. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care, Mary. {{{ }}}<br/>\n<br/>\n~Sue<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;:&gt;&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;<br/>\nNational Home Education Network: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nhen.org\">http://www.nhen.org</a><br/>\n&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;&lt;:&gt;&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Irritated Parent","postDate":"1022303979","msgId":7303,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGYyLjFjMGVmNmU5LjJhMjA3OGViQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":7302,"nextInTopic":7305,"prevInTime":7302,"nextInTime":7304,"topicId":7301,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Can you put the oldest in charge of something with the second one (shoes? seatbelt?)?

I was never late for anything until I had two <br/>\nchildren.   I used to be early, calm, and over-prepared.  When Kirby came <br/>\nalong, I timed stuff and planned for him.  When Marty came along it didn&#39;t <br/>\nwork anymore.

So she has extra shoes, often from thrift stores or Pay Less, <br/>\nand she has a shoe shelf, and I remind when neither of us is frantic.

We went to a party at her house afterward. My two<br/>\ndaughters (ages 4.5 and 7.5) disappeared with their favorite cousin and I<br/>\nsaw them only sporadically. When they were hungry, they went to the buffet<br/>\ntable and helped themselves. When they had to go potty, they could wipe<br/>\nthemselves. When they went out to see their cousin&#39;s dog, they got their own<br/>\nshoes, told me where they were headed, and left.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt immediately made me long for a new baby. &lt;ggg&gt; I got over it, but<br/>\nSTILL... here are my two babies, and they are wildly and suddenly (from my<br/>\nmommy point of view) self-sufficient. Every day there is less and less<br/>\nphysical-care stuff they need from me. They can run their own baths and<br/>\nbrush their own teeth. They can dress themselves. Soon, they will be able to<br/>\nmake their own sandwiches and brush their own hair. Someday, they&#39;ll get in<br/>\ncars and drive away from me and I&#39;ll just have to take it like a woman.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard, physically and emotionally, to have little ones, especially more<br/>\nthan one little one. But it passes. Give yourself a break, and give them a<br/>\nbreak, too. Try to slow your lives down as much as possible. Try to leave<br/>\nlots and lots and LOTS of time before you &quot;need to go&quot; so there is as little<br/>\nstress as possible in the getting-ready process. Limit outside commitments<br/>\nof your time and theirs so there are less places you &quot;need to go&quot; -- you all<br/>\nhave years for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrainstorm with them. Even little ones have good ideas. Ask them, &quot;How can<br/>\nwe make it easier to go places? What would work best for you?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughters and I have been having bedtime troubles recently. We&#39;ve never<br/>\nhad a set bedtime and I&#39;ve had no desire for one. But my kids can now<br/>\noutlast me at night. &lt;g&gt; I have no particular objection to this, except that<br/>\nthey get frightened when Wally and I fall asleep before they do, especially<br/>\nif their sister falls asleep, too, and they are &quot;last Hartley standing&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a long time, they fell asleep before me, so no problem. For some time<br/>\nafter that, Brit was not afraid to be awake alone (and now she is afraid<br/>\nonly sporadically). Mikey is afraid to be awake alone. I am not a pretty<br/>\nsight when sleep-deprived. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the four of us have been trying to figure it out. The solution we finally<br/>\ncame up with was they&#39;re in bed by 10:30 p.m. From 10:30 p.m. to 11 p.m.<br/>\nWally or I tell them stories and read to them. At 11 p.m., they get a video<br/>\nand a kiss, and I go watch Letterman for an hour. Within that time frame,<br/>\nthey&#39;re almost always asleep, and shortly after so am I.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s still been a little bumpy. And I tell them it&#39;s open to change if they<br/>\nor I can think of a better way. And sooner than any of us think, they&#39;ll<br/>\nboth be perfectly fine with being &quot;last one awake&quot; and we can go back to our<br/>\nold habits, which will be a relief to all of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":11828597,"authorName":"Mary Hickman","from":"&quot;Mary Hickman&quot; &lt;mfhick@...&gt;","profile":"mfhickman95616","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Irritated Parent","postDate":"1022299449","msgId":7301,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY3Nmh0QmN0Nzl4ZFREcmthNFowMDAwYjc3OUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":7302,"prevInTime":7300,"nextInTime":7302,"topicId":7301,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello, Just a moment to say I m finding myself irritated again with my kids.
