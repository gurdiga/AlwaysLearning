I couldn&#39;t even read a book <br/>\nto my dd because she didn&#39;t want me to.  We got together as a family <br/>\nand have been deschooling from homeschooling, knowing that <br/>\nunschooling is the way to go.  Our family is so much more happier for <br/>\nit.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat post touched a nerve with me.  I am in a support group here in <br/>\nCT that pretty much promotes that philosophy.  I&#39;m pulling away from <br/>\nit and hanging out with like-minded people.
