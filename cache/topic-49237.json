I heard Andre  <br/>\nAgassi interviewed on NPR a few weeks ago and he talked a lot about  <br/>\nhis lack of choice as a child.  I think that having choices, real  <br/>\nchoices not the placating - do you want to wear your red sweater or  <br/>\nyour green sweater but you have to wear a sweater -- kind of choices,  <br/>\nis so important to one&#39;s mental health.  I know that I feel most  <br/>\ndesperate, discouraged and fearful when I feel like I don&#39;t have a  <br/>\nchoice in what is happening to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my daughter was struggling terribly with anxieties and fears  <br/>\nabout venturing out in public, I tried to give her as much say in  <br/>\nwhether or not she went places and when she could leave them, as I  <br/>\npossibly could.  We usually ended up taking two vehicles to family  <br/>\noutings, and she knew that her dad or I would take her away (home)  <br/>\nimmediately, no questions asked, if she became anxious or concerned.   <br/>\nGiving her that much control over her situation, helped her to feel  <br/>\nthat we trusted her and her feelings and that she could trust us. Over  <br/>\ntime we were able to persuade her to open up to us and let us know  <br/>\nwhat was bothering her, after we&#39;d helped her get away from the source  <br/>\nof her fears.  Then we began to understand better what she was dealing  <br/>\nwith, and also found ways to help her relax about certain issues.  As  <br/>\nthe months and years have passed, she&#39;s much less fearful and anxious  <br/>\nand much more adventuresome.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that giving her so much choice in her comings and goings,  <br/>\neven without understanding exactly what her problems were, helped her  <br/>\nto come back to a more healthy state of mind. Most of the books I  <br/>\nconsulted about children&#39;s anxieties, as well as the mental health  <br/>\nprofessional I took her to see, advised that I push my daughter to  <br/>\nface her fears and even train her to be desensitized to them.   <br/>\nInstead, after floundering about a bit with her, I decided to follow  <br/>\nwhat some other unschoolers were encouraging me to do, to just listen  <br/>\nto her and help her to feel safe and understood.  I tried not to worry  <br/>\nabout the future -- if I thought about it too much I started to see  <br/>\nher as a very disabled young adult. Instead I focussed on honoring her  <br/>\nchoices and making her feel safe now.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe functions out in public very well now and hasn&#39;t asked to go home  <br/>\nbefore the rest of us were ready, for a very long time.  She&#39;s now  <br/>\nhappy and positive about her own future rather than sad and dreading  <br/>\ngrowing up with disabling anxiety.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving choices in life are so important!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChris<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.zamunzo.blogspot.com\">http://www.zamunzo.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Dec 25, 2009, at 5:47 PM, BRIAN POLIKOWSKY wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I was just reading an interview Andre Agassi gave about his new book  <br/>\n&gt; and he talks about how not having a choice growing up affected his  <br/>\n&gt; life.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot; Interviewer: ...But to many fans, the biggest shock was hearing  <br/>\n&gt; that you hated tennis so deeply, that this life wasn&#39;t your choice<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; AA: That&#39;s why I hated it.
