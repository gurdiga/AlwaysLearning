I&#39;ve gone straight to costume books and <br/>\nEnglish history in libraries I&#39;d never been in because I knew the numbers.   <br/>\nBut...    I hesitate to think that a librarian would think that the world wide web, <br/>\nthe whole internet, all the real-world current and constantly updated sites <br/>\nwould need the dewey decimal system.   So I doubt that many really <br/>\ncomputer-savvy librarians would think of the internet as a library.    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut on the other hand, I have a new computer.   I was used to my old one (and <br/>\nits father before it &lt;g&gt;).   I was frustrated that it didn&#39;t have the same <br/>\n&quot;recent documents&quot; feature, and that an add-on I had before (WorkStrip) didn&#39;t <br/>\ndo what IT used to do.    How would I ever find my files?    And Sherlock, even <br/>\nSHERLOCK didn&#39;t do what it used to do.   Oh, I was sad.    Then I figured out <br/>\nthat the regular old &quot;find&quot; feature that used to not find much will now find <br/>\nANYTHING and everything, no matter how badly named. &lt;g&gt;   (Almost.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo maybe I was thinking too much like an old-time librarian or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I wish there had been cool sites like this when my kids were little, <br/>\nand so for all of those of you with still-little kids, you might find some <br/>\nwonderful things (and if they were to use this a few times, the Dewey Decimal <br/>\nsystem might make more sense when they come across that).<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22609,"nextTopicId":22692}}
