This is a common occurrence.  <br/>\nThey usually either walk to the side of the road or take off long before we get <br/>\nthere.  Sometimes there are several of them.  Well, this one changed his mind <br/>\nin mid-lift and got off a little late and we flew into each other.  He knocked <br/>\nthe side mirror right off my Beetle!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI thought he was surely dead, because he hit the road after the impact made <br/>\nhim fly up over the car and I could see him sprawled out flat.  Then, in the <br/>\nrearview, I saw him miraculously arise from that position and take flight!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe car stunk like skunk on that side for a while.  I had to deconstruct the <br/>\nmirror so it wouldn&#39;t fall off on the interstate.  I was afraid to touch it <br/>\nfor getting the stink on me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we came home later, there was his dinner right where he left it, and no <br/>\nsign of him, so I guess he&#39;s okay.  It did get me wondering if turkey vultures <br/>\nwho get whacked on our road get eaten by other turkey vultures.

I&#39;ve told my son what it&#39;s like for me when he &quot;goes off.&quot;  I&#39;ve told him I feel bad or scared or whatever I feel at that moment.  He had no idea what the experience was like for me until I did this.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  The opening of my heart with my experience of the situation brings immediate peace.  One open heart is an invitation to openness that is irresistible and I&#39;m convinced it&#39;s what everyone is looking for.  If I don&#39;t really know what&#39;s happening inside his heart at that moment, then there&#39;s nothing I can do to &quot;help him.&quot;  When I tell him about my feelings his outbursts no longer hold a charge for me.  Opening our hearts ends the &quot;fight or flight&quot; reaction we used to live by, then anything is possible.  Once I admitted my feelings I asked him directly, &quot;you seem to be really upset a lot - how can I help you?&quot;  They have amazing wisdom, children.  They even give me good suggestions when I&#39;m frustrated.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Our culture is very intellect oriented, intellect separated from the heart.  Schools and other &quot;systems&quot; do not provide a safe environment for the emotional side of life.  An open heart is wise and has the simple solution to every difficulty, but I can only open my heart by being willing to &quot;welcome&quot; whatever feeling is showing up for me in the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My son and I both needed to recognize that testosterone is pumping through his veins at an alarming rate.  It was very hard for me to understand that his normal level of testosterone would probably send me to the lock up.  This young guy had to learn to take what nature had intended as a survival drive and try to function in a stifling society.  We bought him a punching bag and he used it.  He loves to shovel dirt and move big rocks.  (This from a 15yo who&#39;s teaching himself web page design.)  Now he studies martial arts.  He is a sensitive, gentle friend who won&#39;t even kill spiders &quot;because they&#39;re defenseless,&quot; but you&#39;d never know it if you heard him &quot;going off.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n  He still has abundant testosterone and needs me to ask him what is going on in his life to cause him such frustration.  It usually has nothing do to with the random appearance of the outburst.  Now we have a running dialog about his friends and his activities which he happily shares because I ruthlessly refuse to try to manipulate or control his relationships or activities.  Unless of course he asks for my input.  I do point out discrepancies between what his friends say and what they do without attaching any meaning or blame, just info.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  We laugh about a lot of things together - I think that&#39;s really important.  I also tell him when I&#39;m concerned about how I perceive his friend&#39;s treatment of him, but always with &quot;I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re abandoning yourself when you tell Rob that you don&#39;t want to hang out today and he shows up anyway and you let him in, etc....&quot;  He will usually ignore frustrations like that until he blows and then remembers that I mentioned the situation before and he feels free to reintroduce the subject.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Last night we went through this routine.  He explained how Rob has been violating his boundaries (to sum it up.)  I asked him if he could use the remote and put Rob on &quot;pause,&quot; what would he like to say to Rob?  He had no trouble at all defining exactly what he wanted.  Once you can imagine yourself accomplishing something, it&#39;s easy to do.  Without these discussions he would just walk around frustrated and blowing his stack all the time.

He loves to shovel dirt and move big rocks.  (This from a 15yo who&#39;s teaching himself web page design.)  Now he studies martial arts.

It usually has nothing do to with the random appearance of the outburst.  Now we have a running dialog about his friends and his activities which he happily shares because I ruthlessly refuse to try to manipulate or control his relationships or activities.  Unless of course he asks for my input.  I do point out discrepancies between what his friends say and what they do without attaching any meaning or blame, just info.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWe laugh about a lot of things together - I think that&#39;s really important.
