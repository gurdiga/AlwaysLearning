I don&#39;t want to comment there; it&#39;s old and ideas might&#39;ve changed.  It&#39;s not about the person, anyway, so if she&#39;s here... don&#39;t claim it. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- It is true that home education is more than about not going to school and when you are with your family all the time you can have different rules about meals, bedtimes and TV. We are not totally there, our daughter can &quot;self-police&quot; much more effectively than our son for example but it is a journey and that is where we would like to go.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nDifferent rules are still rules.<br/>\nSelf-policing still involves enforcement.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a very tiny step from thinking of rules to seeing choices.<br/>\nWithout taking that tiny step, though, the boundless lands beyond are inaccessible.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/self-regulation\">http://sandradodd.com/self-regulation</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75562,"nextTopicId":75583}}
