So I&#39;m watching Terence Stamp <br/>\nplay a long-imprisoned Englishman hunting down those involved in his <br/>\ndaughter&#39;s death...<br/>\n<br/>\nNot usually my kind of movie, but I&#39;m looking at the accent.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, he&#39;s doing an accent that has similarities with that of Ali G and I&#39;m <br/>\nwondering if some Londonite, Londonoid or Anglophilinguist could tell me what <br/>\naccent it was.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8654,"nextTopicId":8749}}
