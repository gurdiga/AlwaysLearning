I remember DOING this, with my kids, as a matter of fact. We made dough and rolled it into long skinny snakes and made letter shapes out of them and baked them. Great fun for kids to make letters that were special to them - their initials, initials of pets, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also had magnetic letters on the refrigerator - lots of them. Just there and sometimes for months, maybe years, nobody touched them. Then, suddenly, I would notice someone was making words out of them. When the kids were a little older we had magnetic poetry words. And, again, sometimes nobody would touch them for months and then somebody would get interested and sometimes that would also get others interested and we might have a week or a month or a year of a lot of interesting refrigerator-writing. These refrigerator things are particularly &#39;passive&#39; on the part of the person (mom) who stuck them on the fridge, but I see no problem with offering stuff. If you have a kid who is sensitive to things seeming schoolish or like forced lessons, then be careful because even such passive stuff might transmit a sense of anxiety or urgency to your child. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t NEED these kinds of things in order for a child to learn to read�.there is plenty of opportunity to engage with letters, sounds, and words in naturally-occuring ways in a family life that is filled with all kinds of interesting stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce&#39;s warning about it being done &quot;for reading purposes&quot; might be misunderstood to mean parents should not do anything to support a child learning to read. Making cookie letters might be done for reading purposes, meaning that a child is showing interest in moving toward reading - by being interested in letters, sounds and words. The issue is whether this is the child&#39;s purpose that a parent is recognizing and facilitating, or the parent&#39;s purpose without regard to the child&#39;s actual level of interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nON the other hand, if baking was already an interest, saying, &quot;We could make letter shapes,&quot; might be a way for a mom to find out if that is an interest. A kid might respond enthusiastically. Or the kid might start making insect shapes instead and, for an unschooling mom, that would be just as cool as letter shapes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that it is fine for parents to introduce things with the underlying hope that it will interest the child.  I mean, why else would we introduce them? And letters, sounds, words, and reading are pretty likely candidates for being of interest at some point, so offering fun ideas that involve those should be a natural for unschooling parents. Play word games in the car or while waiting in line�sing and make up songs �play with rhymes. Get over or at least hide anxiety you might have about kids and reading, and let creating an environment in which letters, sounds, and words are considered fun and interesting and plentiful be a natural part of creating a stimulating and enriching life, in general. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe danger/warning is that parents who are anxious about reading will try to push these things on kids who are not interested. Kids will sense the parental anxiety and that can cause, as Joyce said, the related activities to also become &quot;tainted.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Oct 24, 2011, at 3:33 AM, Joyce Fetteroll wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Creating cookie words sounds fun because it&#39;s such a funny, unusual <br/>\n&gt; concept that kids might find delightful because it&#39;s surprising and <br/>\n&gt; unexpected in life.

Perhaps it wouldn&#39;t hurt<br/>\nto mention that while you&#39;re playing games using the skills he has already<br/>\ngained (you mentioned letters, Sandra mentioned cards of his known words).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy boys made obvious to me the remarkable differences between children&#39;s<br/>\npaths to reading.  While one went from letter game cards and the alphabet<br/>\nand one or two words from a favourite book to deduction and whole word<br/>\nrecogntion around 4-5yo; the other had fewer letters for longer, no<br/>\nalphabetic order (which is not necessary for reading but I remember learning<br/>\nit at the time reading was taught when I was in school), and some word<br/>\nrecognition from gameplay until he was around 8, when he asked for reading<br/>\nlessons to fill in a gap he felt compared to other children.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talked about different ways he could choose to learn (from my experienced<br/>\nand theoretical knowledge and imagination), the ways I&#39;m suited to help<br/>\ndirectly and the ways that I could help indirectly - and he chose to try<br/>\nlearning the &quot;code&quot;. At that point we spent a few minutes a day on a page or<br/>\ntwo at a time in a couple of fun books that presented phonemes. Within two<br/>\nmonths he was happily independently typing to others in his online games (he<br/>\nhad already been communicating by typing in what he had asked us to write<br/>\ndown - the words he wanted to say) and reading whatever he likes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe books we found just right for him appeared coincidentally at the time:<br/>\none I happened upon at an op-shop for AU50cents<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.librarything.com/work/details/4657373\">http://www.librarything.com/work/details/4657373</a> and the Dorling-Kindersley<br/>\nPhonics book borrowed from a friend<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.librarything.com/work/4602176/book/24868645\">http://www.librarything.com/work/4602176/book/24868645</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard of children who enjoy drawing, painting and collage focussing<br/>\nsome creations on their phonemic gleanings.

Hunt around on Amazon and you&#39;ll find a bunch. But pick games which look fun rather than for &quot;educational&quot; content. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou could also suggest things like putting the captions/subtitles on tv and movies. Does he have any video games which involve reading? I found Mo ignored most of the text on video games and just figured things out without reading things for a long time, but now she likes captions on games with mostly spoken dialog. She&#39;s a big fan of captions in general. You could point things like that out to your son and mention that its reading. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Find books to read for him? (but what kind of books? books on reading? or books he may enjoy?)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If he likes you to read to him, read him books he enjoys. He might like it if you read &quot;younger&quot; books to him so he can memorize them and &quot;read&quot; them back on his own. A lot of kids use that as part of how they learn to read. Or, if he likes to tell stories, offer to write them down for him so you can read them back to him and he can read them to himself and others.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe may want to read but not be ready to read - Mo went through that with riding a bike, wanting to before she could manage the trick of it. Give him chances to play with words, but also reassure him that he doesn&#39;t have to read right now. Has he said Why he wants to learn to read? Sometimes kids get the idea they Should from tv or friends or relatives, so its good to check in on that and find out what his motivation may be.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] ds6 wants to learn reading","postDate":"1319393949","msgId":63563,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFFQjM1ODIxLUJDQ0EtNENCMS1CQ0Y2LTYyNDI0NjQ1NDRFOUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGo4MWtwbytobjhwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGo4MWtwbytobjhwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":63562,"nextInTopic":63564,"prevInTime":63562,"nextInTime":63564,"topicId":63562,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Should I get some phonic DVDs?-=- No. -=-Get leapfrog DVDs (he enjoyed it when he was a baby and learned letters through that)-=- Nah.
