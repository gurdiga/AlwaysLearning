And I think they are better for short-term goals. We used a reward <br/>\nthingie when the kids were trying to stop sucking their fingers. They wanted <br/>\nto use the chart AND they wanted to stop sucking, the latter being essential <br/>\nbecause otherwise no system would work. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is off the topic mostly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was teaching ninth grade, not long after I had taken a ton of <br/>\npsychology classes in the operant conditioning, Skinner days, one of the <br/>\ncoolest and most popular girls in the school was in my class (she had been <br/>\nwhen she was in 7th grade too, which is part of why she went with this...).<br/>\n<br/>\nShe had an irritating habit which caused teachers and kids alike to bristle.  <br/>\nShe would click her tongue against the back of her front teeth before she <br/>\nsaid something. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the full-body dialect of Northern New Mexico, and she being Hispanic, this <br/>\nwas a kind of insult.  So she basically started each statement with &quot;Oh, SI&quot; <br/>\n(only not that verbally), a kind of disdainful &quot;you won&#39;t understand this, <br/>\nbut...&quot; before each statement.  She did it when she meant to, with feeling, <br/>\nbut it had stuck itself in her mouth and she didn&#39;t know how to get it out.  <br/>\nShe would do it just to herself, too, when she was writing or thinking, and <br/>\nthose probably WERE judgmental--self criticism expressed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose who knew her and liked her (and there were lots) knew she didn&#39;t mean <br/>\nit to be antagonistic, but those who didn&#39;t like her responded bristly.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo one day when one of the kids was razzing her to stop it, she nearly cried, <br/>\nand I said &quot;If you want us to help you stop, I have a way.  We&#39;ll only do it <br/>\nif you want to.  We&#39;ll quit if it&#39;s bugging you.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBless those other 28 or so kids, they were sweet and helpful.  Every time she <br/>\n(I don&#39;t remember her name right now, which is fine; I remember her face and <br/>\nvoice and hair and sweetness) clicked, each kid and I would click softly <br/>\nright after.  No giggling, no even looking at her.  I don&#39;t know whether the <br/>\nkids in that English class were doing the reinforcement elsewhere or not, but <br/>\nin class, for a week, we clicked when she clicked.  Only by Friday she wasn&#39;t <br/>\nclicking.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd no big deal was made by anybody about it.  We didn&#39;t discuss it anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt had never involved either punishment or reward.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still amazed at that many 14 and 15 year olds being that mature and <br/>\nmatter-of-fact in a school setting.  It could have gone badly, but it was a <br/>\ngood group and they trusted me and there was good will all around.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMAYBE if a child has a habit she wants to break (Holly bites her nails and <br/>\nwhen she runs out of nails starts on cuticles), finding a little signal which <br/>\nis inobtrusive just to indicate that you see her and she&#39;s doing it, which <br/>\nisn&#39;t judgmental, but just &quot;ping&quot; for her benefit might help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hate to see conditioning TOTALLY put in the garbage just because some <br/>\npeople use it roughly.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":386,"nextTopicId":413}}
