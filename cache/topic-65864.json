Let&#39;s see how long the story setup takes. LOL! I was at the dojo for my son&#39;s karate<br/>\nclasses. Before class, one of the mom&#39;s told me her daughter had bought a ticket to join us at a concert in a couple months (I drove dojo teens to a<br/>\ntrampoline birthday party last Saturday, she was with us, heard about the concert, and I offered her our last car spot if she wanted to come). The mom<br/>\nwas going on about how when they searched for tickets and lots of places said the show was 19+. I said I was pretty sure we&#39;d have noticed that, and<br/>\nthat the notice about the venue change earlier in week had said old venue tickets would be honoured so I doubted it had changed. But she was pretty<br/>\nadamant that at least the first venue was 19+ and I started to wonder.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still had 2 hours of classes to wait, I knew the tickets, sitting at home pinned to our bulletin board in the kitchen, would say if there was a 19+<br/>\nrestriction. It was stuck rolling around in my mind so I decided to text my daughter Lissy (17) to ask her to look at our tickets. I explained to her<br/>\nwhat the mom had said. Lissy was busily working in her room and here&#39;s how the conversation went ...<br/>\n<br/>\nLissy: I know where they are but I don&#39;t wannnnaaaa<br/>\n<br/>\nMe: LOL!! Pretty please? I don&#39;t wanna worry.  (I laughed first to acknowledge her &quot;whiny&quot; reaction, it&#39;s a funny, dramatic persona she can bring out<br/>\nas needed. Not to belittle her for not wanting to stop what she was doing. It works well because she knows that.)<br/>\n<br/>\nLissy has sent you an image (she thought to take a pic of the tickets! proof beyond mere words: &quot;All ages welcome.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nMe: You rock sooooo much!! I&#39;ll show her the pic. Love you!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nLissy: You too<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\nYay! I asked her to do something for me that she didn&#39;t want to be interrupted to do, and I still rock.

(Isn&#39;t the internet a MUCH better place to meet people than in dark bars?)  The last time she visited, she was talking about the ordeal of helping her son move across the country, and one part of it was an unmade bed, the morning they were leaving and she said she wasn&#39;t going to make that bed for him, and she rolled her eyes when she told me the story.  I said maybe if she had made beds for people over the years it would have been better.  I actually said it.  I didn&#39;t say the full thought which was &quot;maybe your son would be nicer and you wouldn&#39;t be living all by yourself.&quot; That would be cruel, but I did say something.

I&#39;m not up for splitting hairs, so I&#39;ll restate: &quot;The concept does not work for everyone or in all situations.&quot;<br/>\n&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m not sure under what circumstances not forcing your child to do chores doesn&#39;t work. My memory of my childhood burdened with chores is that my mom worked harder to get me to make my bed than it would have taken her to do it on her own as a sweet gift that she offered to me. She made up chore charts for me in her beautiful penmanship with a space for each daily or weekly chore that I accomplished to be marked with a gold star. My brother and I had alternating dishes nights. On my night there were always words. Always a fight over when they were going to get done and what punishment I would achieve if I failed to do them in whatever time limit had been set. I cannot imagine that the kerfuffle surrounding my inability to take my chores as a joyful sharing of the burden of being a part of a family was less than the labour required to pick up my or my brother&#39;s slack.<br/>\n <br/>\nI suppose my parents believed that they were instilling in me a work ethic that would carry me through my life. They weren&#39;t seeking to lessen their own burden but to raise my brother and I up with the knowledge of the effort involved in making a household run smoothly. Although that may have been a goal lost in the haze of their fury at my complete failure to do just one simple chore without it turning into a massive argument. Lots of what they did was fueled by a motivation to make me a better adult. Or to make my society a better society even if it was to my and my brother&#39;s cost. Childhood is a very transient experience, but adulthood lasts a lifetime, or something. I think that&#39;s an easy view to get lost in. <br/>\n<br/>\nChores don&#39;t make things easier. Not for anyone. If your life is too big for you to manage alone, find other ways to manage it, pare it down, hire folks to help, close off bits of it. Assigned work for your children won&#39;t instill in them any values, or it is unlikely to. I knew that doing dishes sucked. I knew that making a bed was pointless. I knew that mowing the lawn was a huge, huge task that made you hot and sweaty and wasn&#39;t worth the effort. David, who had no chores as a child, doesn&#39;t know the same truths. He sees things that need doing and he does them, because he doesn&#39;t want things to need doing. I don&#39;t know if his lack of chores or my surfeit of chores made it so, but I don&#39;t give Simon and Linnaea chores and find that if I ask them to help, they mostly say yes and move with a quick step to come and help. And if they say no, well, I was going to say we accept it, but yesterday Simon&#39;s back was needed to help push the car into the garage, so<br/>\n no wasn&#39;t accepted. But he was willing to have us override his no without any complaint. I can&#39;t think of another time in recent memory where David or I have pushed Simon or Linnaea to do something that they had already refused to do. And I do believe the lack of a work requirement has made a difference in how willing they are to help. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think chores work. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a concept issue.

She&#39;s saying<br/>\nit won&#39;t work (they won&#39;t do them voluntarily) if one of the parents has<br/>\npoisoned the atmosphere with negativity and the kids are already really<br/>\nresistent.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, yeah, true.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I think the concept we&#39;re talking about has little to do with chores,<br/>\nreally, but is setting the stage for our kids to learn to be thoughtful,<br/>\nresponsible, kind, generous, careful.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe set the stage in various ways: modeling the characteristics we want  our<br/>\nchildren to develop is probably the most important. A necessary condition,<br/>\nI think. We also are inviting - we welcome them to join us as WE behave<br/>\nthoughtfully, responsibly, kindly, generously, and carefully. We give them<br/>\nopportunities to experience how it feels to be that way (good, it feels<br/>\ngood). But ALL of this hinges on having a nonadversarial partnership type<br/>\nof relationship with our kids in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Perspective","postDate":"1329968965","msgId":65865,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMjk5Njg5NjUuMTc0MzEuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTA3Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDM3MDlGMDI5LTMxQUQtNEIyMC1CQzdGLUY5QjVBMTVFQTZDOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDM3MDlGMDI5LTMxQUQtNEIyMC1CQzdGLUY5QjVBMTVFQTZDOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":65864,"nextInTopic":65867,"prevInTime":65864,"nextInTime":65866,"topicId":65864,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"   Work? what does she mean it","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1931971928\"> <br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Whatever.

Thanks, but a lot of that writing is other people&#39;s, and the original ideas changed my life when I heard them, and I can&#39;t take credit for all of that! But I&#39;m glad people are liking some of it!<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________<br/>\n<br/>\nPerson from the Past:<br/>\nFine and good if both parents are on board, but when one&#39;s agenda is to undermine everything &quot;family,&quot; the kids learn the passive-aggressive power of refusing, being contrary and digging in heels. Unfortunately, this power dynamic can remain even after the negative parent is out of the home.<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd:<br/>\nBoth parents need to be in agreement for most things in life--buying a car, a house, deciding where and whether kids will go to school. The ideas are for those who want the and can use them.<br/>\n<br/>\nA book about building a house won&#39;t work for someone who doesn&#39;t own land and can&#39;t afford building supplies, but I think it&#39;s okay that &quot;build your own house&quot; books exist. I see no benefit in complaining about them.<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________<br/>\n<br/>\nPerson from the Past:<br/>\nI guess I was just pointing out the obvious--that radical chores don&#39;t work for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\nSandra Dodd: <br/>\n‎&quot;Radical chores&quot; isn&#39;t a good name for what those pages are talking about at all. There&#39;s discouragement there of even thinking of &quot;chore,&quot; but to do things out of generosity and love.<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________<br/>\n<br/>\nPerson from the Past:<br/>\nWhatever.
