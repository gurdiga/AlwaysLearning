Its been a slow, but rewarding process.<br/>\nOne of the things I have heard many times from wise people on this email list is &quot;Be present with your kids.&quot;  I thought I have been doing well with that, as we are more often than not, together.<br/>\n  I was with three of my kids at the movies this afternoon.  I was reading some emails while we were waiting for our movie to start.  Some advertisements were playing and my 6 year old tapped my arm and said, &quot;Mommy, you&#39;re not watching this with me.&quot;  I realized then that while I am usually with them physically, my mind is often elsewhere, and they know it.  I&#39;ve fallen into the trap of spending too much time reading about homeschooling/unschooling and not enough time actually putting it into practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nSheryl<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPhone</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71814,"nextTopicId":71851}}
