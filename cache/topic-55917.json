Lots and lots of people <br/>\nreally do believe that spanking IS the answer to behavior.  Might makes right. <br/>\n I&#39;ve never lived in the south.  One of my friends grew up partly in the south <br/>\nand partly in the NW, as an adult ended up in the south for a while and hated <br/>\nit.  Her experience is that if you don&#39;t go to church, you won&#39;t find many <br/>\nfriends.  If you don&#39;t go to the &quot;right&quot; church people will talk behind your <br/>\nback.  If you don&#39;t discipline your child the &quot;right&quot; way, you may be shunned. <br/>\n That&#39;s her experience.  She&#39;s lived in many parts of the US and this is <br/>\nsomething that happens in the south, in a way that doesn&#39;t happen in other <br/>\nplaces.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSouthern hospitality, she says is superficial, it&#39;s all for show and as long as <br/>\nyou fit all the other criteria of social norms, people will continue to be <br/>\nhospitable, otherwise not.  In that kind of environment, I can see how NOT <br/>\nspanking would be really hard.  It would be easier to pull out a belt, since <br/>\nthat IS what is expected of parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday a mom spanked a little kid for not getting off the swing fast enough <br/>\nfor her liking.  She did it in anger and it was violent.  Margaux was very upset <br/>\nby it.  I&#39;m glad it upset her, I&#39;d hate for her to see it as normal.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe police were at my neighbors house for a long time yesterday, the little boy <br/>\ndidn&#39;t think anything of it.  The police have been over there a lot.  Margaux <br/>\nwas afraid for him, he spent most of the day at my house to avoid all the drama <br/>\nat his house.  That is his experience of life in the small time he&#39;s been alive, <br/>\nthat drama that sometimes involves violence is normal, that police showing up is <br/>\nnormal, that adults in uniforms can ask you to take off your clothing to inspect <br/>\nyou is normal, and he goes about his life by riding his bike and going to the <br/>\nneighbor&#39;s house.  That was probably normal for his mother growing up too, so <br/>\nshe repeats it because it&#39;s normal.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose things are so far from normal for my kids that they cause fear.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":348277234,"authorName":"organicmom111","from":"&quot;organicmom111&quot; &lt;cksah@...&gt;","profile":"organicmom111","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: a world of bullshit","postDate":"1279394011","msgId":56120,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGkxc3ZjcitncmZyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGkxc3FoYithcjBxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":56119,"nextInTopic":56121,"prevInTime":56119,"nextInTime":56121,"topicId":55917,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"That s true in the part of the world where I live - the rural, mostly white, South.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1266227105\">&#39;That&#39;s true in the part of<br/>\nthe world where I live - the rural, mostly white, South.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n????

I got into plenty of that, hence the spankings. The<br/>\nthing that kept me from getting into drugs, for instance, was not only<br/>\nthe fear of spankings --which had dwindled almost to nothing by the<br/>\ntime drugs were a consideration-- but also the fear of more parental<br/>\ndisapproval and the potential presented to us kids in continued<br/>\nthreats of parental rejection. I wouldn&#39;t call it parental involvement<br/>\nbut a supreme form of Skinnerism put in terms of Strong Willed<br/>\nchildren via the likes of James Dobson, whose advice really was<br/>\nlistened to and followed. The term &quot;tough love&quot; describes the way it<br/>\nwas talked about pretty well. It was meant to be a way for parents to<br/>\nput their kids on automatic: set &#39;em and forget &#39;em. That wasn&#39;t<br/>\nusually said but the phrase &quot;seen and not heard&quot; was said. And it was<br/>\nintentional. There were four girls in my family of origin and both my<br/>\nparents worked full-time and then came home to a huge garden and the<br/>\nanimals to care for on our mini-farm, church and choir duties, and so<br/>\non. They didn&#39;t have time for much involvement, certainly very little<br/>\nthat was one-to-one.  Spanking and thinly veiled threats of<br/>\nabandonment were there to control the factors that weren&#39;t as easily<br/>\ncontrollable. It was because we kids depended on our parents love,<br/>\ninvolvement and approval that spanking even worked.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was stable alright.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, Jul 13, 2010 at 8:38 AM, Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; -=- I feel like I&#39;m spreading misinformation, and I&#39;m uncomfortable<br/>\n&gt; with people debating a book without having read it. -=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We weren&#39;t debating the book, though, just playing around with an idea.<br/>\n&gt; And it&#39;s not the book anyway, it&#39;s his summary of studies he&#39;s read<br/>\n&gt; (and sometimes talked to the researchers).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-I really do encourage folks to check the book out from the library<br/>\n&gt; if you&#39;re curious about what it says.

Sorry! I *think* what it said was, in African-American families, spanking is more common. Whether the kids are spanked or not is not really an indicator or whether they will exhibit violent behavior elsewhere like it is in American culture as a whole. Because the punishment is not seen as taboo, it is less emotionally traumatic to the kids. In a culture where spanking is seen as horrible, kids are likely to feel like there is something really wrong with them if mom snaps and spanks them. <br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully someone else read this too. Honestly it might have said African-American kids who are spanked more are less likely to get in trouble. Having worked in a very depressed, predominantly African-American neighborhood, I can believe it. Not to conflate African-American culture with poverty across the board, but when there is a lot of crime literally right outside your door, having parents who are highly involved and let you know what kind of behavior they think is right, even if they spank, can be a big factor in keeping out of trouble. All us liberal white suburban Americorps volunteers working there had the luxury of being sympathetic to the plight of the prostitutes, but the moms of little girls in the neighborhood had to tell the kids straight up that that behavior was not acceptible under any circumstances. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t spank, and I wish other people were given better parenting skills than that. I do respect that some people are doing the best with what they know, as opposed to just being shitty child abusers. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlex</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":183568025,"authorName":"Bob Collier","from":"&quot;Bob Collier&quot; &lt;bobcollier@...&gt;","profile":"quaussiebob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: a world of bullshit","postDate":"1278988044","msgId":55928,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGkxZ2l1YysxMDJrbEBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDU0RUY1MEY1LTcyMEYtNDRDQS04RTlCLTczRERFNjQ4NDY3MkBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":55924,"nextInTopic":55929,"prevInTime":55927,"nextInTime":55929,"topicId":55917,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

In a culture where spanking is used to force compliance by breaking a child&#39;s spirit, the child most likely, in my experience, wouldn&#39;t exhibit any violent behaviour at all for fear of another spanking. Measuring that against even only very occasional violence from a child who isn&#39;t spanked, I could easily suggest that my research shows (nurtureshock horror!) a spanked child is actually less violent than an unspanked child (and child managers masquerading as parents would perhaps be happily nodding their heads) but it would be an interpretation of what&#39;s actually happening not the whole story.
