If I lived without <br/>\nenough food I would TELL my children to eat and eat  now.  If I lived in need <br/>\nof blackout, I would tell my kids to turn the  lights off and BE QUIET NOW.  <br/>\nI see this as a luxury of peace and plenty,  but proving in those <br/>\ncircumstances that children can and do learn to read and  manipulate large numbers without <br/>\nlessons, that they can pick up information  about history and science just in <br/>\nthe course of a fun life, and tie these things  in to all sorts of scattered <br/>\ninterests and hobbies and intellectual pursuits is  of benefit to the world&#39;s <br/>\ngeneral knowledge.   And these things I&#39;ve  listed above are possible because <br/>\nof the abundance of printed word, and  broadcast information, and otherwise <br/>\nfairly easily accessible information  arriving by the second.  What we do <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have been possible in 1850,  nor even 1950 except for the wealthiest who <br/>\ncould travel, have educated servants  to hang out with children and answer their <br/>\nquestions in a leisurely fashion, see  plays and live music, etc.   <br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21844,"nextTopicId":21859}}
