However, in the digital age, attending classes in a designated physical location is a preference not a necessity. Each student at a school could have an &quot;Individual Education Plan&quot; that included the best use of mobile virtual learning as it related to that student&#39;s personal lifestyle - and that of his or her parents or caregivers. Each student would be like an affiliate of a specific school. Registered at it but not required to be there physically. Nothing would change as far as what the school expected of its students - curriculum, etc. - but they could be part-time in the classroom being taught and part-time at home using the internet, as it suited each particular family. Home when the parent or caregiver is home, in school when the parent or caregiver is at work. The IEPs could all be negotiated to a sophisticated level with the right attitude, I&#39;m sure. Okay, it would take a lot of imagination from a lot of people who might not have much, but, if I was President, it&#39;s what I would be pushing for ahead of bringing mobile virtual learning technology into the classroom and trapping it there, which is what many schoolists seem to be obsessed with at the moment.

Except, racism and ethnic hostilities are <br/>\nrampant in the public schools. Public schools are breeding grounds for <br/>\nracism - that&#39;s where kids from families like ours, that embrace <br/>\ndiversity and enjoy it (and are, in fact, part of the diversity), are <br/>\nintroduced to it and where they are likely to first experience it <br/>\ndirected at themselves.  Does she seriously think all that diversity <br/>\nexists in a sweet and wonderful atmosphere of mutual respect? Think <br/>\nagain. Some areas have extremely NON-diverse school populations. There <br/>\nare schools that are nearly entirely Latinos, or Blacks, or Vietnamese, <br/>\nor whatever. And in those areas where schools have been integrated, <br/>\nthere is great hostility toward those who come into a neighborhood <br/>\nschool from &quot;elsewhere.&quot;  My own kids interacted with a much more <br/>\ndiverse population as unschoolers than they would have done in our local <br/>\npublic schools. And it was very natural and easy interaction without any <br/>\nkind of issue being made over it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Pressure to conform exists in any peer group&  certainly in schools.

They interact with people of all ages, based on common <br/>\ninterests more than simply on proximity. Unschooled kids can spend lots <br/>\nand lots of time with those friends, and they&#39;re not told &quot;We&#39;re not <br/>\nhere to socialize.&quot; &lt;g&gt; Some kids LIKE having a lot of people around and <br/>\ntheir parents can facilitate them being involved in lots of group <br/>\nactivities, to the extent that the kid loves it.

Since I&#39;m doing a documentary on the subject I appreciate any opportunity to be challenged in my reflexion by a good devil&#39;s advocate :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIsn&#39;t the diversity a myth about public school? Doesn&#39;t the price of real estate in the school&#39;s neighborhood determine the parents&#39; social background - and often ethnic background as well? According to Gatto who taught in very rich and very poor neighborhoods of NYC for 30 years, public school is more like a getto than a place that offers diversity. Never mind the lack of diversity in terms of age range, being this artificial place where you&#39;re locked up in a classroom with 20 people your own age. It&#39;s much richer and healthier for a child to have friends of all ages, and it is more like real life: as adults we are able to form friendships based around interests and affinities rather than limited to age.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re saying that the negative social aspects of school (&quot;looking back and feeling lame for having cared about certain things & wanting to be like/liked by certain people&quot;) are part of how kids grow into adults. So what about societies where there are no schools? And what about our society, before schooling was the norm? Do you think those people who didn&#39;t go to high school didn&#39;t grow into adults? What about Lincoln, Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, did they not grow up? :) You specifically mention high school years, so I&#39;d like to quote Gatto here:<br/>\n&quot;Throughout mot of American history, kids generally didn&#39;t go to high schoo. Yet the unschooled rose to be admirals, like Farragut; inventors, like Edison; captaisn of industry, like Carnegie and Rockefeller; writers, like Melville and Twain and Conrad; and even scholars, like Margaret Mead. In fact, until pretty recently, people who reached the age of thirteen weren&#39;t looked upon as children at all. Ariel Durant, cho co-wrote and enormous and very good multivolume history of the world with her husband Will, was happily married at fifteen.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother lesson that I have issues with is being taught to wait for other people, better trained than ourselves, to make the meanings of our lives. The expert makes all the essential choices. Only the teacher can determine what his kids must study or rather only the people who pay him can make those decisions, which he then enforces. School is necessary in a society where you need clerks. And more than anything, we don&#39;t want our son to learn that he has to obey stupid orders. Much to the contrary, we want to encourage him to question authority whenever things seem to be unfair, absurd or simply stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is something Gulu (DH) wanted to add: I like the idea of my son learning what he&#39;s passionate about and interested in and going to the bottom of it, and not being interrupted all the time by bells and changing rooms.  I want him to be able to seek out answers while the questions are burning inside him and dig as deep as he wants. I went to school myself. I forgot 80% of what I learned in 12 years of schooling. I learned most of the things that are important in my daily life by living and following my curiosity and interests. In school, my curiosity was simply interrupted. I remember being very excited about a history class and I was very frustrated when the bell rang. I had to wait till the next class. Two days later, I started asking all my questions. The teacher answered the first one, the second one... and at the 3rd she told me she&#39;d love to answer all my questions but she had a program to follow and didn&#39;t have time. So I got the message and never asked anymore questions -  and I lost all my interest in the matter. I could have gone to the library to find out by myself but I didn&#39;t have that impulse because she was the expert that was supposed to teach me everything I needed to know.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday Gulu is a professor at UCLA and all over Europe, and he learned everything he teaches doing autonomous research. Which reminds me of his country&#39;s president, Lula, who said, the day he became president: &quot;I&#39;ve been criticized all my life for not having a degree. The very first diploma I get in my life is that of president of Brazil.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nClara</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":294520986,"authorName":"Joanna","from":"&quot;Joanna&quot; &lt;ridingmom@...&gt;","profile":"ridingmom1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Why unschooling is better than schooling","postDate":"1263601654","msgId":49653,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhpcjE1bSsxMGtnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhpcXBjaStjNXZqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49650,"nextInTopic":49678,"prevInTime":49652,"nextInTime":49654,"topicId":49550,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

And I think the argument from their side will indeed end up being all about cultural habits (aka tradition) and social convenience and not about education at all. Perhaps that will be obvious to everybody too and school will at least lose its arbitrary and increasingly undeserved status as the method of education against which other forms of &#39;education&#39; are to be judged. The fascinating thing for me in what&#39;s happening to schools now is that they&#39;re not up against so called alternative ways of educating our children, they&#39;re up against how most people - children and adults - live their everyday lives outside of the school classroom. <br/>\n<br/>\nBob</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":294520986,"authorName":"Joanna","from":"&quot;Joanna&quot; &lt;ridingmom@...&gt;","profile":"ridingmom1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Why unschooling is better than schooling","postDate":"1263439477","msgId":49596,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhpbTJwbCs0bnVhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDRCNEU3RUM3LjQwOTAwMDZAbWFjLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":49590,"nextInTopic":49607,"prevInTime":49595,"nextInTime":49597,"topicId":49550,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Most of the kids were bored and some seemed happy (some kids will <br/>\nalways &quot;make the best of it&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was torture for me - I just wanted to pull out my wallet and use my <br/>\nown real money, but I felt like that was not allowed.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHEN came the clincher.  After the workshop was over we were invited to <br/>\nput down a deposit and take the baggie of fake money with us so that we <br/>\ncould work with it more at home. And nobody laughed. The parents lined <br/>\nup and plunked down their $5 deposit and walked off with a baggie full <br/>\nof badly made fake coins and bills.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Why unschooling is better than schooling","postDate":"1263407786","msgId":49563,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA2MkE1MkI3LTIwQkEtNEMwOS05RUFFLTg5NDc3OEFCMEE2MkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAyREM5MkQ2LUUzREItNEEyMC04ODIxLUIzQzk4MURDREQ4OUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDAyREM5MkQ2LUUzREItNEEyMC04ODIxLUIzQzk4MURDREQ4OUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":49562,"nextInTopic":49565,"prevInTime":49562,"nextInTime":49564,"topicId":49550,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I want my child to live and learn in the world not locked in a room reading about it.-=- When Kirby was little, my friend Jay was concerned about the ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2020237351\">-=-I want my child to live and learn in the world not locked in a room<br/>\nreading about it.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Kirby was little, my friend Jay was concerned about the  <br/>\nlimitations of homeschooling.  He never had children.  His sister did,  <br/>\nthough, and so he had a niece about Kirby&#39;s age or a little older.   <br/>\nThis conversation took place in about 1991.<br/>\n<br/>\nJay said that schools were changing and they weren&#39;t so bad, and that  <br/>\nin his niece&#39;s school they had a little store, and that the kids  <br/>\nearned credits and could buy things in that store.  I think it had  <br/>\nthings like candy, but also little toys that kids had brought to  <br/>\ndonate, or some such.   I listened to his whole story, waiting for the  <br/>\nreally good part.  He said it helped them learn about money and math,  <br/>\nbecause of  what they could afford and what would be left.<br/>\n<br/>\nI said there was a Circle K right around the corner and my kids went  <br/>\nthere with real money and bought real things.   (Circle K was a  <br/>\nconvenience store associated with a filling station.)<br/>\n<br/>\nJay hadn&#39;t thought of that.  He seemed immediately surprised and  <br/>\nimpressed and then thoughtful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason a store was a good idea at his niece&#39;s school is that those  <br/>\nkids were locked away from access to real stores.  If one of my kids  <br/>\nsaid &quot;I have some money; will you take me to Target?&quot; we could have  <br/>\ngone.  Or ToysRUs or wherever they wanted to go.
