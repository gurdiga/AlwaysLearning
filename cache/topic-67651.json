You&#39;d have to deprive the of much<br/>\nof being part of the world. There is too much reading material everywhere -<br/>\nif they&#39;re ready to read, they have plenty of opportunity to learn.

No teaching -<br/>\napparently her 5 year old sister was answering questions for her (what does<br/>\nthis spell?).<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving had one very early reader, one sort of average timing, and one a bit<br/>\nlater - I do think there are disadvantages to early reading. But - that&#39;s<br/>\nlike saying there are disadvantages or advantages to early or late walking<br/>\nor sitting up or saying &quot;Mama.&quot; What does it matter? They are going to do<br/>\nit when they do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe huge societal emphasis on reading as early as possible is misplaced,<br/>\nthough, in my opinion, for two reasons - one is that the pushing is<br/>\nharmful, in and of itself, but also I really think early reading isn&#39;t<br/>\nadvantageous for the child.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Reading When Ready","postDate":"1339674369","msgId":67652,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc1QUM1QjBELUI4RDYtNDlEMC05RjFDLTBFQjU5QTU3RkI5N0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMTIwNjE0MDk0ODUxLjk4MDYzOHIxOHBndXpmZW9Ad2VibWFpbC5jb21jZW4uY29tLmF1Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMTIwNjE0MDk0ODUxLjk4MDYzOHIxOHBndXpmZW9Ad2VibWFpbC5jb21jZW4uY29tLmF1Pg=="},"prevInTopic":67651,"nextInTopic":67657,"prevInTime":67651,"nextInTime":67653,"topicId":67651,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
