His dad and grandfather were both pilots (his  <br/>\ngrandfather a bomber pilot in WWII).  He&#39;s an actor, but is taking  <br/>\nhis family with him to remote and exotic locations.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people have asked in the past how to make their homes more  <br/>\ninteresting, various suggestions are made, but I think the biggest is  <br/>\nto be more interesTED in things, to pursue more of your own  <br/>\ncuriosities, and to find the good and interesting parts of things  <br/>\ninstead of inventorying them for their stupid and inferior and boring  <br/>\nparts.   We could define lots of things as stupid and boring, but  <br/>\neverytime we do that, we make our worlds smaller, and when our worlds  <br/>\nare smaller, our children&#39;s worlds are smaller.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30449,"nextTopicId":30455}}
