On a biochemical level, it&#39;s wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe suggested that for conversations involving two people but not that<br/>\nlevel of deep contact, it&#39;s often far better to be facing the same<br/>\nway, shoulder to shoulder (which is why talking on walks or during<br/>\ndrives is often really good), because there isn&#39;t the same level of<br/>\nhormonal involvement that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW, YMMV,<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~L!<br/>\n<br/>\ns/v Excellent Adventure<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theexcellentadventure.com/\">http://www.theexcellentadventure.com/</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: A need to &quot;coach&quot; more concentration?","postDate":"1245680375","msgId":46003,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRENUQxMEIxLTA0MjktNDAyQi1BQkJELUQ5NkYyNkU3MTE3Q0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMGYwMWM5ZjJlYSQ1MWM4YzEzMCQwYzAwYThjMEBLbmF1ZmZIb21lUEM+","referencesHeader":"PDE1OTU0NS4xNTgzNi5xbUB3ZWI2MjEwNS5tYWlsLnJlMS55YWhvby5jb20+IDxFNjVDNEE1RS0xNzY4LTRCQ0EtOEYwMC03RkRGNzc0QUU0REJAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDwwMDBmMDFjOWYyZWEkNTFjOGMxMzAkMGMwMGE4YzBAS25hdWZmSG9tZVBDPg=="},"prevInTopic":46002,"nextInTopic":46004,"prevInTime":46002,"nextInTime":46004,"topicId":45844,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: A need to &quot;coach&quot; more concentration?","postDate":"1245658548","msgId":46002,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIyMzQxNy41NjY1MC5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwNS5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDE1OTU0NS4xNTgzNi5xbUB3ZWI2MjEwNS5tYWlsLnJlMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDE1OTU0NS4xNTgzNi5xbUB3ZWI2MjEwNS5tYWlsLnJlMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":46001,"nextInTopic":46003,"prevInTime":46001,"nextInTime":46003,"topicId":45844,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I rarely say no to Simon or Linnaea and certainly almost never shout it.

For some, eye contact can be so overstimulating, that if forced, the person cannot concentrate on what is being said, and communication may break down completely.  Listening, for many people, can only take place if eye contact in not required.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, socially, eye contact is expected and valued in our society.  If a person refuses or is unable to maintain (or at least give the appearance of maintaining) eye contact,  in certain situations, that person may very well run the risk of appearing inattentive, disinterested, and even untrustworthy.  This could be important at say, a job interview, where first impressions can be very important. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would not force my children to make eye contact when speaking with me-- I have one who naturally makes great eye contact and one who listens better without.   But I do talk to both of my children about how much most of our society values eye contact.    I think it would be a disservice not to make them aware.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Sandra Dodd <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, June 21, 2009 10:21 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: A need to &quot;coach&quot; more concentration?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  -= Right or wrong in my methods of showing him how to listen, I&#39;m <br/>\n  really glad he listens the way he does! -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s not a &quot;right or wrong.&quot; My mom would be sure the reason I was <br/>\n  never hit by a car was that I&#39;d been spanked for going into the street.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The discussions here are rarely about the individual families, but <br/>\n  about the idea.<br/>\n  The idea of commanding a child &quot;Look at me&quot; isn&#39;t the only way to get <br/>\n  his attention or to keep it, and looking at a person isn&#39;t always <br/>\n  indicative of paying attention.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I found where I had put the notes from the last discussion:<br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thinkingsticks.blogspot.com/2008/07/eye-contact-and-ancient-instinctive.html\">http://thinkingsticks.blogspot.com/2008/07/eye-contact-and-ancient-instinctive.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  Schuyler put some links there.

Modelling it so that he can see what he&#39;s  <br/>\ndoing without also making it seem sarcastic or rude.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few times I whined back at my kids if they were whining.  I wouldn&#39;t  <br/>\nhave done it if it had made someone sad or furious (which it easily  <br/>\nhad the potential to do.   More often I said in a normal, kind voice  <br/>\nthat I would understand better if they didn&#39;t whine.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is total conditioning, this next story, but it worked, and I  <br/>\nthink conditioning (a.k.a. training, manipulation) is better than  <br/>\nnothing if a child isn&#39;t at all susceptible (for whatever reasons) to  <br/>\ndiscussions of the principles involved.<br/>\n<br/>\ni was teaching 9th grade and there was a girl in my class who was  <br/>\nbright and popular and had a bad habit.   It was irritating, and she  <br/>\nknew it, but she didn&#39;t know how to stop it.   Sometimes people would  <br/>\nmake comments back, or sometimes she would get in trouble with her mom  <br/>\nor a teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat she was doing was doing the little tongue cluck &quot;tsk&quot; that so  <br/>\noften is used as a comment of derision when someone else says  <br/>\nsomething one thinks is stupid.  It was pretty common in Northern New  <br/>\nMexico in those days (70&#39;s) as a bi-lingual put-down.  But she didn&#39;t  <br/>\nmean it as a put down.  She did it after everything she said, kind of  <br/>\nas a habit of &quot;finished.&quot;  I&#39;ve seen kids who mouthed what they had  <br/>\njust said right after they said it.  Kirby did that for a while.  It  <br/>\nwas like a review for him, but also showed that he was through with  <br/>\nhis statement.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I asked the girl if she wanted us to help her stop, and she said  <br/>\nyes.  So I asked the others in that English class, which was the first  <br/>\none of the morning and that was helpful, to just quietly make the tsk  <br/>\nnoise whenever this girl did.   They agreed.  They all liked her  <br/>\nenough that they were willing to help.  I said don&#39;t even look at her  <br/>\nor make a deal of it, but if we make the noise she&#39;ll know she had  <br/>\ndone it and can try not to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t sure it would work well, but it did.   Sometimes she would  <br/>\nmake the noise to herself while she was writing.   25 others softly  <br/>\nrepeated it.   The first day there were probably 25 or 30 of them.     <br/>\nThe next day maybe ten.  In operant conditioning terms, &quot;the behavior  <br/>\nwas extinguished&quot; in four or five days.  I think the fifth day there  <br/>\nwas one tsk.   She was happier and everyone in the class had learned a  <br/>\ntrick.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t among the first dozen tools I&#39;d recommend to unschoolers,  <br/>\nbut it&#39;s good to have options in extreme situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":124256069,"authorName":"alohabun","from":"&quot;alohabun&quot; &lt;alohabun@...&gt;","profile":"alohabun","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: A need to &quot;coach&quot; more concentration?","postDate":"1244949368","msgId":45852,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGgxMXExbytxaDlqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDk2Mzc1Ni4yNTk0MC5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":45849,"nextInTopic":45858,"prevInTime":45851,"nextInTime":45853,"topicId":45844,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"When your ds talks about his games and makes noises from some shows, he is probably excited to share that with you and is interested in them.
