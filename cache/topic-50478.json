Even, dare  <br/>\nI say, radically so!-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree.  I don&#39;t own &quot;radical unschooling.&quot;  The reason that&#39;s the  <br/>\nname of my page is that when I went to make an expage.com page a long  <br/>\ntime ago, when web pages has a character limit, &quot;unschooling&quot; was  <br/>\nalready taken. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, it seems that for someone to name a list that is dishonest and  <br/>\npurposely misleading.  &quot;LOA-unschoolers&quot; would be clear and shorter.   <br/>\nBut then I value clarity and honesty.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I&#39;ve done things over the years, whether write or speak or  <br/>\nmaintain a website or list, it was for other people, not for me.  Part  <br/>\nof the reason I&#39;m known by name is that I&#39;ve used my own real name  <br/>\nrather than a nickname.  Part of the reason is integrity.  When people  <br/>\nmeet my kids they don&#39;t go home and say &quot;Oh no; not a good  <br/>\nsituation.&quot;   We did hear that about some of the TCS people&#39;s kids,  <br/>\nmany years back, that their theories (and practice of not telling  <br/>\nspecific stories) were not &quot;producing results.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat kind of results, though?  What I&#39;ve wanted for my kids was that  <br/>\nthey avoid the damage school does, and that they stay curious and  <br/>\nhappy--that attachment parenting could extend from those toddler days  <br/>\nwhen they only walk away from the mom by their own choice, and are  <br/>\nallowed to come back when they want to (to her lap at a park, or to  <br/>\nthe bed at night), to the days that young adults can drive away by  <br/>\ntheir own choice when they want to, and come back if they need to.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis worked out well for our family.  It&#39;s working out well still.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anytime over the past fifteen or more years since Kirby started  <br/>\nunschooling I had been thought to have been dishonest or a fraud or  <br/>\nincompetent, no doubt you would have heard about that.  My kids have  <br/>\nbeen out there, at park days here and visiting other places, and  <br/>\nsometimes at conferences. Lots of families have visited here.  We&#39;ve  <br/>\nvisited (in subgroups and a time or three as a whole family) with  <br/>\nothers.  We haven&#39;t been self-promoting about our family, but neither  <br/>\nhave we been secretive.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat could I have wanted to &quot;attract&quot; or &quot;manifest&quot; other than what we  <br/>\ncould have and do by living warmly and generously with each other?  We  <br/>\ndon&#39;t need to &quot;attract&quot; learning; it happens inside of us, not  <br/>\noutside.  I don&#39;t need to &quot;manifest&quot; unschooling.  It&#39;s a process and  <br/>\na way of living.  I was sharing unschooling and peaceful parenting  <br/>\nbecause it seemed important to share, and because I felt indebted to  <br/>\n&quot;the community&quot; of volunteer mothers who had helped me through La  <br/>\nLeche League and birthing advice and assistance.  I felt guilty for  <br/>\nhaving talked my cousin out of homeschooling, in the 1970&#39;s, and  <br/>\nwanted to do some penance to make up for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I see about &quot;the law of attraction&quot; is a scam intended to make a  <br/>\nfew people rich.  Amway fizzled, but the new scamway is currently  <br/>\nmaking them money.  It won&#39;t forever.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone in an unschooling discussion last year wrote something like  <br/>\n&quot;The universe has promised us that we can have whatever we wish for.&quot;   <br/>\nI don&#39;t remember anyone saying &quot;WHAT!?  That&#39;s nonsense!&quot;  They were  <br/>\n&quot;supportive.&quot;  (Or ignored it maybe; I forget.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe universe hasn&#39;t promised anyone anything at all.  Gravity, maybe.   <br/>\nAtmosphere and temperature are variables on this planet.  Storms,  <br/>\nvolcanos and earthquakes aren&#39;t caused by nor prevented by anyone&#39;s  <br/>\nLoA wishboards or stated intentions.<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman nature has some realities.  Like attracts like.  Druggies hang  <br/>\nout with druggies.  Kind people who reject mean friends and avoid mean  <br/>\nrelatives can eventually find themselves surrounded by many more kind  <br/>\npeople than mean.  Honest people who don&#39;t accept or condone  <br/>\ndishonesty can count on their friends, because they&#39;ve been  <br/>\ndiscriminating about who they will call &quot;friend.&quot;    Bullshit attracts  <br/>\nbullshit, or at least attracts people who can&#39;t tell bullshit from  <br/>\ntruth.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there are tools people can learn from ANY book, pamphlet, movie,  <br/>\norganization, religious group, that&#39;s fine.  But if they start trying  <br/>\nto apply those things to the manipulation of others then a morality  <br/>\nissue comes along.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscussions of integrity and morality are generally way beyond  <br/>\ndiscussions of what will help unschoolers with their eight year old  <br/>\nboys today, quickly and easily.   In the long run, though, good  <br/>\nunschooling and generously helping others can lead to integrity and  <br/>\nmorality, bit by bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Deschooling Support Group","postDate":"1265535027","msgId":50525,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg4MjA4OC4xNjk5Ny5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDcubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDgzODIwLjE1MTE1LnFtQHdlYjExMDQwNy5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGhrbDlkais2Y29jQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8REVCQjc2NjQtNzZGRi00NTEzLUJEOUItMDdCQjg2MjU5NUM5QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8ODM4MjAuMTUxMTUucW1Ad2ViMTEwNDA3Lm1haWwuZ3ExLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":50524,"nextInTopic":50527,"prevInTime":50524,"nextInTime":50526,"topicId":50478,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oh and the NVC stuff and other complimentary theories.  I kind of wish that whole section could be axed completely.

GAG!  People sent curriculum links for advice on how to unschool math and other BS of that nature.  It&#39;s BAD!

School will be assumed to have a curriculum and measurements.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn each state, there has come some way to opt out of that school  <br/>\nattendance, either by homeschooling or by creating a private school  <br/>\nregistration situation.   In every case they either expect or require  <br/>\nthat the curriculum and measurements will be continued, in another  <br/>\nform, elsewhere.  In no state or nation where there is a mandatory  <br/>\nschool attendance law is ANYone (administration, judicial officers)  <br/>\naccepting of the idea of a family doing nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a family defines unschooling as doing nothing, that is illegal to  <br/>\npursue.  If a family wants to &quot;unschool better&quot; but not to do it well,  <br/>\nthat is only barely beginning to be acceptable is the child is younger  <br/>\nthan the age at which education become mandatory.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor unschooling to be rich and full enough to be comparable to the  <br/>\nlearning that&#39;s presented in a curriculum, it needs to be done well.   <br/>\nIt needs to be rich and full.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a parent admits that it&#39;s baffling, and admits she does not want to  <br/>\ndo it well, then she should probably put her children in school.   <br/>\nUnschooling isn&#39;t easy.  She should NOT be patted on the back or have  <br/>\nher hand held about maintaining a stance in which she doesn&#39;t intend  <br/>\nto go so far as to really understand it and solidly commit to doing it  <br/>\nwell.  And she should not be helping others to settle for better  <br/>\ninstead of great.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think when people want hand holding and back patting it can be about  <br/>\nher wanting it to be about her, rather than about her children.
