By episodes I mean screaming for 9 hours straight, hitting and biting himself and others , Im having to pin him down to keep him from attacking his sisters.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Over the past several months he has had me so exhausted I feel like I havent been there for my girls. For example yesterday they wanted to make their bunny hutch ( its a gigngerbread house with an easter theme) I sat and helped with getting icing into the bags and such but I just wasnt &quot;there&quot; with them. All i was thinking about was how much i desperatly wanted my son to go to sleep and crash myself. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  My sons actions have caused extreme stress on the entire family . its not about me worried that they will get behind and not learn x at y time. Its feeling like maybe for my girls school next year may be a richer more interesting and less stressful environment.  <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nNever miss a thing.
