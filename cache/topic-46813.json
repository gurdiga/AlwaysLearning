Not sure if  <br/>\nthat&#39;s still true.)<br/>\n<br/>\nExcerpt:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Babies and young children are designed to explore, and they should  <br/>\n&gt; be encouraged to do so.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The learning that babies and young children do on their own, when  <br/>\n&gt; they carefully watch an unexpected outcome and draw new conclusions  <br/>\n&gt; from it, ceaselessly manipulate a new toy or imagine different ways  <br/>\n&gt; that the world might be, is very different from schoolwork. Babies  <br/>\n&gt; and young children can learn about the world around them through  <br/>\n&gt; all sorts of real-world objects and safe replicas, from dolls to  <br/>\n&gt; cardboard boxes to mixing bowls, and even toy cellphones and  <br/>\n&gt; computers. Babies can learn a great deal just by exploring the ways  <br/>\n&gt; bowls fit together or by imitating a parent talking on the phone.  <br/>\n&gt; (Imagine how much money we can save on �enriching� toys and DVDs!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But what children observe most closely, explore most obsessively  <br/>\n&gt; and imagine most vividly are the people around them. There are no  <br/>\n&gt; perfect toys; there is no magic formula. Parents and other  <br/>\n&gt; caregivers teach young children by paying attention and interacting  <br/>\n&gt; with them naturally and, most of all, by just allowing them to play.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Joyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46592,"nextTopicId":46657}}
