We were performing a mock<br/>\ninterview for a woman with a lot of experience as a<br/>\nCNA and other related medical areas.  She was asked<br/>\nwhat she expected as a salary, and was at a loss as to<br/>\na polite way to word a response without aiming too<br/>\nlow, or scaring them away with a highball figure.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did a round table discussion afterwards, throwing<br/>\nout suggestions for improving her weaker answers and<br/>\npointing out where her answers were strong.  When she<br/>\nasked about how to answer the salary question, I<br/>\nsuggested something along the lines of &quot;I am hoping<br/>\nfor a salary commensurate with with experience, but I<br/>\nam flexible about my starting wage.&quot;  The instructor<br/>\nof this college level course, easily 20 years older<br/>\nthan me and with a masters degree, looked at me<br/>\nstrangely and laughed out loud.  She said,<br/>\n&quot;Commensurate?!  That&#39;s related to depressive<br/>\nfeelings.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was my turn to look quizzical.  I articulated<br/>\ncarefully &quot;Com-men-su-rate?  Are you certain?&quot;  She<br/>\nnodded, so I said &quot;I don&#39;t mean commiserate.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe looked at me blankly and said  &quot;oh&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe woman who was doing the mock interview didn&#39;t know<br/>\nthe word either, and asked me about it.  So I got the<br/>\ndictionary and showed it to her and she experimented<br/>\nwith using it, or similar wording, in different ways<br/>\nto ask for an appropriate salary.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think I was a very big hit with the<br/>\ninstructor, although I certainly was not trying to<br/>\nembarrass her in any way.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163750020,"authorName":"tuckervill2@aol.com","from":"tuckervill2@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] RE: Vocabulary, was TV","postDate":"1068814772","msgId":17324,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNi4yNzAwOWM3My4yY2U2MmJiNEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":17322,"nextInTopic":17326,"prevInTime":17323,"nextInTime":17325,"topicId":17297,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/13/2003 6:18:40 PM Central Standard Time, SandraDodd@aol.com writes: Tim Curry. ~~~ Yeah yeah!

We ended up <br/>\ngetting a book on tape from the library, and LOVED it. I had never read it <br/>\nbefore, so I was really thrilled to discover where exactly all of those common <br/>\npirate references originated: Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum, pieces of eight, <br/>\nwalk the plank, dead men tell no tales, etc. (Actually, it reminded me of going <br/>\nthrough The Pirates of the Caribean ride at Disneyland.) Anyway, when I had <br/>\nto get the book on tape I felt like a bit of a failure, so your comments on his <br/>\npurposefully bad writing was insightful.

I caught a cold on the Banks; fog is not for me; nearly <br/>\ndied of interviewers and visitors, during twenty–four hours in New York; cut <br/>\nfor Newport with Lloyd and Valentine, a journey like fairy–land for the most <br/>\nengaging beauties, one little rocky and pine–shaded cove after another, each with <br/>\na house and a boat at anchor, so that I left my heart in each and marvelled <br/>\nwhy American authors had been so unjust to their country; caught another cold <br/>\non the train; arrived at Newport to go to bed and to grow worse, and to stay in <br/>\nbed until I left again; the Fairchilds proving during this time kindness <br/>\nitself; Mr. Fairchild simply one of the most engaging men in the world, and one of <br/>\nthe children, Blair, AET. ten, a great joy and amusement in his solemn <br/>\nadoring attitude to the author of TREASURE ISLAND.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Here I was interrupted by the arrival of my sculptor. I have begged him to <br/>\nmake a medallion of himself and give me a copy. I will not take up the sentence <br/>\nin which I was wandering so long, but begin fresh.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n&quot;The sentence in which [he] was wandering so long&quot; was the entire first <br/>\nparagraph, which never came to its point.<br/>\n-----------<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom another letter:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;DEAR MR. BARRIE, - This is at least the third letter I have written you, but <br/>\nmy correspondence has a bad habit of not getting so far as the post. That <br/>\nwhich I possess of manhood turns pale before the business of the address and <br/>\nenvelope. But I hope to be more fortunate with this: for, besides the usual and <br/>\noften recurrent desire to thank you for your work-you are one of four that have <br/>\ncome to the front since I was watching and had a corner of my own to watch, <br/>\nand there is no reason, unless it be in these mysterious tides that ebb and <br/>\nflow, and make and mar and murder the works of poor scribblers, why you should not <br/>\ndo work of the best order. The tides have borne away my sentence, of which I <br/>\nwas weary at any rate, and between authors I may allow myself so much freedom <br/>\nas to leave it pending. We are both Scots besides, and I suspect both rather <br/>\nScotty Scots; my own Scotchness tends to intermittency, but is at times <br/>\nerisypelitous - if that be rightly spelt. Lastly, I have gathered we had both made <br/>\nour stages in the metropolis of the winds: our Virgil&#39;s &#39;grey metropolis,&#39; and I <br/>\ncount that a lasting bond.

Before anyone gets <br/>\nexcited, though, the whole concept of &quot;reading level&quot; is a construct of school <br/>\ntextbook analysis and production, born of remedial reading specialists getting mas<br/>\nters&#39; degrees in ultimately ruining people&#39;s lives and the school system as <br/>\nwell.  (Bad attitude on my part, but justifiable.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nReading level is a formula that has to do with the average and maximum length <br/>\nof words (syllables, I think, but maybe letters--if anyone knows, tell us!) <br/>\nand the average length of sentences.    That&#39;s why book with &quot;first grade <br/>\nreading level&quot; have choppy little sentences, and as the level gets higher they get <br/>\nlonger.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if public writing like Newsweek aims for 8th grade (on the reading-level <br/>\nword/sentence count) that leaves whatever was rated &quot;college level&quot; for <br/>\ntextbooks and William F. Buckley columns.  But honestly, I can read Buckley and I <br/>\ndon&#39;t WANT to.  It makes my skin crawl and my nervous system curl at the edges, <br/>\nknowing he&#39;s purposely obfuscating, in prevention of ease of access to the <br/>\ncommon seeker of editorial profusion, thereby rarifying that audience or <br/>\nreadership to whom he might thereafter feel any responsibility of clarity.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe makes it difficult on purpose because he&#39;s a snob writing for snobs, and <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t WANT to speak to common people.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo somewhere in the vocabulary recalbration from the 50&#39;s to now, perhaps a <br/>\nclass of language is being closed down.<br/>\n<br/>\nLanguage is living and changing, and it&#39;s possible that telling people to cut <br/>\nthe upper-class clap-trap isn&#39;t really a bad thing.  If people want to read <br/>\nRobert Louis Stevenson novels as a hobby, that&#39;s fine.

Rod Serling <br/>\nwas a master of the metaphor and a surgeon of the simile.  He would take <br/>\nwords and mold and shape them into short stories – vignettes that would bring home <br/>\na point with a crash.  Take a look a one of  Serling&#39;s figurative passages <br/>\nhere, from Time Enough At Last (November 20, 1959). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Witness Mr. Henry Bemis, a charter member in the fraternity of <br/>\nDreamers.  A bookish little man whose passion is the printed page but who is <br/>\nconspired against by a bank president and a wife and a world full of <br/>\ntongue-cluckers and the  unrelenting hands of a clock.  But in just a moment Mr. Bemis <br/>\nwill enter a world without bank presidents or wives or clocks or anything <br/>\nelse.  He&#39;ll have a world all to himself.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] RE: Vocabulary, was TV","postDate":"1068733989","msgId":17298,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIzLjM3Nzc5YzlkLjJjZTRmMDI1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":17297,"nextInTopic":17299,"prevInTime":17297,"nextInTime":17299,"topicId":17297,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I was watching TV.

I&#39;m not a fan<br/>\nof the &quot;classics&quot; in literature, but even what I read (biographies, animal<br/>\nbooks, Nancy Drew) had a wider vocabulary than most of today&#39;s fiction. My<br/>\nTV (westerns, Perry Mason, Star Trek) gave me wider exposure as well than<br/>\ntoday&#39;s hit list (my kids are hooked on the entire Disney Channel lineup, so<br/>\nperhaps there is decent programming out there beyond the Lizzie McGuire<br/>\ngenre that I haven&#39;t seen....) <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to generalize too broadly, but as much as I strew, my kids just<br/>\naren&#39;t exposing themselves to the range of material I did, and consequently<br/>\nhave smaller vocabularies. In some respects, it&#39;s a moot point, since I have<br/>\nto tone down my own vocabulary 90% of the time anyway.
