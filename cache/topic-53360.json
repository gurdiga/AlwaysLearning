None of their<br/>\ncomments were used--but their faces were used with voice overs and<br/>\njuxtaposed with the doctor&#39;s voice talking about orgasm during breastfeeding<br/>\nbeing normal.

I also thought some of my knowledge might come in handy for some of you. I like unschoolers. I like unschooling. I also like the media. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers are the least likely to make sweeping arguments about anything, media included.  What mostly happens in media, in regards to unschooling, is like what happened to Marina when she did an interview about breast feeding, something completely normal and good, and they turned it into something weird with a disturbing slant.  I&#39;ve also seen some fairly decent things written about unschooling in the media, but they completely missed the point of it, like doing a story about breast feeding with the assumption that baby formula is better, and then showing an extreme option of using human milk as if it&#39;s somehow abnormal.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people believe that school is THE be all end all to human enlightenment, that without it, all society will break down and kids will grow up to be huge losers that all hard working people will need to support.  Any time, any thing that counters that, gets put into the news, it&#39;s going to be viewed with that lens either by the media, by the viewers, or both.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to be visiting a friend from Germany today.  I used to live with him in college and we&#39;ve maintained a friendship.  He&#39;s never liked the idea of homeschooling even though he likes me and my family.  He just had a baby.  Even if I managed to change his mind, he still wouldn&#39;t be able to homeschool his child unless his partner agreed and they moved out of the country.  I doubt he watched the GMA thing, but if he did, he&#39;d be in the segment of the population that would see sensationalist journalism for what it is, but he&#39;d probably STILL agree with it.  He&#39;s a very intelligent person.  That news segment didn&#39;t have an audience of people like him, their audience was one that LIKES sensationalist news pieces.  It has about 1000 comments, mostly negative, I haven&#39;t read most of them or even tried to keep up with them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat bothers me, is the family that offered themselves up, was a really great unschooling example.

I don&#39;t want <br/>\nChristine and Phil to feel bad about this at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this segment put our freedoms at risk - especially in some states <br/>\nwhere unschoolers are barely skimming under the radar already.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve accepted the fact that they will always find someone willing to <br/>\ndo it - someone with super good intentions - someone who figures this <br/>\ntime it will go well.

One of her sons is a bookish kind of <br/>\nkid - reads ALL the time. The day they filmed, there were hours that he <br/>\nsat around and waited for things to happen, always reading. On the show, <br/>\nthey made it seem like he didn&#39;t even know HOW to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was interviewed by a well-known evening news show. It was me, my <br/>\ndaughter, a homeschooling dad, and his son. The questions were decent, <br/>\nthe reporters seemed intelligent and interested. There was a lot of time <br/>\nfor chatting in between actually filming and the reporter used what we <br/>\nchatted about to form his questions - so they weren&#39;t just <br/>\npre-determined questions written by someone who really knew so little <br/>\nthat he didn&#39;t know what to ask (the usual kinds of questions we get). I <br/>\nfelt really good about the interview.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it aired - I GASPED out loud. They did a little promo of it before <br/>\nthe commercial break. The PROMO showed my daughter and Matthew and said, <br/>\n&quot;Rose and Matthew don&#39;t go to school, but their standardized test scores <br/>\nare very high. How can this be?&quot; (I have the words slightly wrong - but <br/>\nthat&#39;s the gist of it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWHAT THE HECK? We&#39;d told him we don&#39;t test. That was a POINT made and <br/>\ndiscussed. Rosie and Matthew, neither of whom ever went to school or had <br/>\nANY school-at-home of any kind, had most definitely never taken any <br/>\nstandardized test. So not only did the NEWS reporters make up that they <br/>\ntested , they made up that they scored high.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was an overall unusually positive piece - the interviewer was pretty <br/>\nintrigued and it showed.

I joined<br/>\nthis list and some others, and last Saturday I received Sandra&#39;s book and<br/>\nstarted reading. It was really odd that Monday morning my mom called me to tell<br/>\nme that there was going to be a segment on GMA about unschooling (she saw me<br/>\nreading the book). I thought maybe she misunderstood (I mean, what a<br/>\ncoincidence!) but sure enough, I set my DVR, and when I got home later in the<br/>\nday I watched it. Thank goodness I was reading the book and following comments<br/>\non the list, because I think that perhaps if I hadn&#39;t, the bias of the program<br/>\nwould have made it much easier for me to discount unschooling as a viable<br/>\noption. It has been a roller coaster week for me (and I&#39;m sure many others)<br/>\nbecause of the media coverage of unschooling. It&#39;s hard enough to be a<br/>\nhomeschooler at times, and this week seeing unschoolers portrayed so negatively<br/>\nhas really caused me to think long and hard about<br/>\nthe decision to unschool. It is definitely not the easy road, but as I read<br/>\nthese posts I am encouraged to continue reading and investigating and watching<br/>\nit unfold. Thank you Joyce for your last post...it is so helpful for those of<br/>\nus who are newer to unschooling to hear the voices of those who have been living<br/>\nand writing about it for so long.

The ideal teacher is irrelevant  <br/>\nto a child&#39;s experience with a real teacher constricted by meeting the  <br/>\ngoals that ensure she keeps her job.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me you&#39;re doing exactly what you&#39;re saying others are  <br/>\naccusing the journalists who report on unschooling of doing: you&#39;re  <br/>\ninterjecting yourself and your agenda (to defend journalistic ideals)  <br/>\ninto this &quot;story&quot; and not really hearing and digging beneath what  <br/>\npeople are saying ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  I thought this group might be open enough to hear another  <br/>\n&gt; perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As in most discussions with two different points, people tend to read  <br/>\nto see if others agree and miss what *else* is being said. I suspect  <br/>\nmost people *did* get your point about journalists in your first post.  <br/>\nYou&#39;re reading for &quot;Yes, I agree&quot; and missing that people *are*  <br/>\nagreeing but following it with a &quot;but&quot; which makes it feel like  <br/>\nthey&#39;re missing your point. The point for this list is what&#39;s relevant  <br/>\nto unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether ideal journalists are awesome at their job is irrelevant to  <br/>\nthe more important point that unschoolers have rarely encountered the  <br/>\nideal. Doesn&#39;t your journalistic instinct see a story in that? Don&#39;t  <br/>\nyou want to know why? You&#39;re expending your thoughts and words  <br/>\ndefending what should be and missing how and why reality is different.  <br/>\nThe real issue, since this is an unschooling list, is that unschoolers  <br/>\nneed to be aware of how they&#39;re likely to be portrayed by the media  <br/>\nbecause more often than not unschoolers have been burned.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor unschoolers the issue isn&#39;t the ideals of journalism but how the  <br/>\nrealities of journalism will likely affect them. The important points  <br/>\nare:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Grabbing the audience attention gets in the way of objectivity and  <br/>\ntruth. No matter how clear they are, the reporter needs to write  <br/>\nsomething that will grab the audience&#39;s attention.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Unschooling is difficult to understand for parents who are spending  <br/>\nhours a week investigating. It can, as Sandra pointed out, typically  <br/>\ntake a year. No journalist can understand unschooling in the short  <br/>\namount of time they&#39;re given to produce a story. Asking questions  <br/>\nisn&#39;t enough when the journalist doesn&#39;t realize the foundation they  <br/>\nassume is beneath the topic they&#39;re investigating needs thrown out.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, to understand homeschooling, people only need to throw  <br/>\nout part of the foundation: that kids don&#39;t need the &quot;administrator of  <br/>\nthe curriculum&quot; to be an expert when there are only a few kids.  <br/>\nHomeschooling can be seen as schooling with a lot more flexibility.  <br/>\n(But even that took years before journalists approached it from that  <br/>\npoint of view.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut to get unschooling, pretty much the entire foundation needs  <br/>\nscrapped. As just a *piece* of what needs thrown out, it&#39;s  <br/>\nunreasonable to expect a reporter to question their knowledge that  <br/>\nmath needs poured into kids in a specific way and to grasp that  <br/>\nbuilding an understanding of how numbers work through video games and  <br/>\nliving life not only works but works better. The two approaches don&#39;t  <br/>\nend up in the same place. An unschooled child will appear ignorant of  <br/>\nmath next to a schooled child and yet the unschooled child will truly  <br/>\nget what they&#39;re doing when they manipulate numbers. That&#39;s because  <br/>\nthe schooled child&#39;s goal is usually a good grade. An unschooled child  <br/>\nneeds the answer to make life work (get to the next level, save up to  <br/>\nbuy a toy).<br/>\n<br/>\nTo get unschooling, someone needs to question *everything* they  <br/>\nbelieve about learning, education, teaching. If the reporter doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nunderstand, they can&#39;t ask the right questions. I&#39;ve been writing  <br/>\nabout unschooling for nearly 15 years, trying to explain it to brand  <br/>\nnew people and I still don&#39;t have a way of getting people who are  <br/>\neager to grasp unschooling to realize they need to clear the  <br/>\nfoundation to build a new understanding on. It&#39;s unreasonable to  <br/>\nexpect a reporter who doesn&#39;t realize they need to do that to form an  <br/>\naccurate picture of unschooling. It&#39;s unreasonable to expect a  <br/>\nreporter who *does* realize they need to clear the foundation to then  <br/>\nbe able to do that for their readers.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":187982044,"authorName":"Martha","from":"&quot;Martha&quot; &lt;martha_h9@...&gt;","profile":"martha_h9","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling and the media","postDate":"1272177946","msgId":53387,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhyMG9lcitiZHVrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEQyMzVGNTM3LUQyNjItNEE0NS1BRDlBLTcxNjY1NDY2Q0JBQUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":53386,"nextInTopic":53390,"prevInTime":53386,"nextInTime":53388,"topicId":53360,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... -- Thanks Sandra.

Why do you think they are rushing to defend? Is it unfair of them to want to defend schools? <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see how you can read shrillness into writing, unless I was using a lot of capitalized words or lots and lots of exclamation points. Shrillness is something you hear in someone&#39;s voice. If there&#39;s no voice, then, well, it&#39;s in your own head.

And I&#39;m sorry if you think I am being unfair.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not a big fan of schooling. I have absolutely zero good memories of school. School caused ridiculous amounts of anxiety for me when I was growing up. I can&#39;t imagine anyone wanting to go to school. And yet, some kids do. Does this make them bad or wrong, in your opinion?

Yes, they did. I have seen in several posts people lumping the media together as a whole based on one segment. A perfect example is the one that Marina just posted a little while ago.

It just kept sticking in my head as I read these posts about that interview. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;While, ideally I agree with this.  That is NOT what has happened time and time again with the media, in regards to unschooling.  Like you said, it isn&#39;t new.  There have been plenty of reporters and others within the media that have done expose&#39;s on unschooling.  Some of them have resulted in more people coming to understand unschooling.  The truly terrible ones like the recent one, are the kind that do more harm than good, even if some good comes out of it for a handful.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- I disagree.

They did not even remotely seem genuinely curious or open minded about unschooling.

I know this is true. But you could think of it as just a way to learn for yourself how to tell a better story. How to really observe the links between daily life and unschooling.

That is NOT what has happened time and time again with the media, in regards to unschooling.  Like you said, it isn&#39;t new.

The more detail you give, the better the story. What<br/>\n&gt; video game was it?

I am a former newspaper reporter, pre-mommy days. I love the idea of unschooling, but I am still not sure how or if it will eventually fit into my 2-year-old daughter&#39;s life because I co-parent with her father and we are not a couple. <br/>\n<br/>\nEducation was/is very important to both of us. Since I began investigating forms of education, my ideas about how our daughter will/should learn are becoming less mainstream. Her father still holds the same ideas about education that he did before she was born. So we&#39;ll see. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, there have been a lot of angry comments about the media lately on this forum. I don&#39;t doubt that you all have reasons to feel this way. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut there are a few things I want to comment on. This is going to be general because I don&#39;t have time to go back through the thread and find each comment. I keep thinking that it might be useful to all of you who are doing interviews or who are thinking about it, if you could keep an open mind about how the media works and if you could hear from the perspective of a reporter.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, some media outlets go straight for ratings. That is true. More so when you are talking about TV. Print media is generally more fair, I&#39;d say, but they have to keep it short so inevitably, the whole story does not get told in one article.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, there will and should always be the other side. A good reporter will/should mention critiques of anything in a story. Especially something that is controversial like unschooling or homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s how the media strives for balance. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut journalists in general do not, or really I should say, ideologically, should not have an &quot;agenda.&quot; I put this word in quotes because I believe I saw it more than once in the the threads on the media. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey are looking for good stories. <br/>\n<br/>\nJournalists may have their own perspective or hold an opinion on a topic, but in general, I believe that they are curious and open-minded group of folks who are truly interested in new and innovative ideas. It&#39;s one of the reasons they become reporters. (I know unschooling isn&#39;t new, but it is new to many people.) <br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone mentioned in the thread that it was good to stick to talking points. This is only a good idea if you really think that the reporter you are talking to is out for blood. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I was giving advice, and if anyone is interested in my take on this as a reporter and someone who has worked in the media, I would say this: <br/>\n<br/>\nTell your story in as much vivid detail as you can. Have really awesome examples of how unschooling works. Don&#39;t use generalizations. Don&#39;t try to use talking points. Reporters have a nose for a good story, if they are a good reporter. They like details. They like something you can sink your teeth into. Sure, controversy gets ratings, but so do really good stories. <br/>\n<br/>\nA good example might be of how video games helped a child learn math or problem solving techniques. Or how a trip to the zoo made your child interested in looking up more about a rare species and then spent hours reading books about it. The more detail you give, the better the story. What video game was it? How much time did the child spend on the math or problem? How did you connect the dots when you saw what your child was doing? These are the types of details I&#39;m talking about. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just making this stuff up. I&#39;m sure you all have lots of stories like that. Those are what&#39;s going to catch the interest of a good reporter and those stories will catch the interest of their readers.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of you may say that the whole point of unschooling is exactly the opposite of what I&#39;m talking about, that you don&#39;t want or need to quantify how your child is learning. I know this is true. But you could think of it as just a way to learn for yourself how to tell a better story. How to really observe the links between daily life and unschooling. It&#39;s also fun to write/tell stories with lots of vivid details. <br/>\n<br/>\nA good reporter can also tell when someone is holding back and that&#39;s when they start digging. Don&#39;t give them a reason to dig. What are trying to hide? Fear? What are you afraid of? They will want to know that too.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor what it&#39;s worth. That&#39;s my take on the media. I don&#39;t think unschoolers should hold back and hide unschooling because they fear the media or they are afraid it will get twisted. The more you talk about it, the more mainstream it will become and maybe someday it will be the norm. Wouldn&#39;t that be wonderful?<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, you are going to run into reporters who are dumb, lazy, out for blood, tired or simply don&#39;t care. Look for the good ones, give them your stories and watch people&#39;s interest grow. Don&#39;t be afraid of the media. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust because someone says something negative about unschooling in an article or on a news report doesn&#39;t mean that everyone reading or watching will believe that side. There are plenty of people who will only hear the good stuff and will sit back and say, &quot;Hmmm, that sounds interesting. I&#39;ve never heard of unschooling. Maybe I&#39;ll go read more about it online.&quot; Then they come across Sandra&#39;s website or this group or other groups and find out more about it, like I did. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing, if it wasn&#39;t for my reporter instincts, I never would have bothered to check out unschooling. I would have just dismissed it. <br/>\n<br/>\nBest, Martha <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.momsoap.com\">http://www.momsoap.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53393,"nextTopicId":53454}}
