I am late-ish and having to send a year end report, a summary, it shouldnt be hard to do really, but I must get into the right mindset to write it without feeling I am not truthful or embellishing, for it is a &quot;schooly&quot; report I must write. VERY gratefully the school board for the Province of Nova Scotia is for, not against, homeschooling, and wants to know what we&#39;re up to on a curious way, supportive. The school board was questioned by an official as to whether homeschooling was valid and proveable, so we are on a radar - but - we were assured that we are simply to tell what we did...<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, I am collecting my thoughts and confidence in order to type and send in our year end reports for ages 7, 9, and 16.<br/>\nI have a 21 year old who joined high school after unschooling from 5th to 10th grade.

Don&#39;t act, speak or think automatically all day, all the time.  Practice stopping, thinking of two choics and consciously making the better choice.  Think through the why.

They try on voices, faces, postures and ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nParents should encourage and facilitate their playful experimentation.<br/>\n<br/>\nParents can learn playfully, too.

Kids also needed to hear things aurally, ear-to-brain.  And they also benefitted from being able to touch things (depending on the topic) and to see things.  Some need to discuss things.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for unschoolers, remember to have things to touch, taste, hear, see.  And smell, maybe, sometimes. <br/>\n<br/>\nThink of different senses, for a good, whole learning experience.
