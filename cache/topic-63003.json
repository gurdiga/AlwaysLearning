A <br/>\nstudent said, &quot;She makes it seem easy and not really hard - I think it <br/>\ncould be more work.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow - maybe this person wants the class to be more demanding by covering <br/>\nmore material or get into more depth - that would be a reasonable <br/>\ncomplaint. But, honestly, the first part seems like a compliment, not a <br/>\ncriticism. I think I do a good job of making it seem easy because I <br/>\ndon&#39;t try to make it seem more complicated than it needs to be by <br/>\nfocusing on major principles as opposed to less-important details. But I <br/>\nknow a lot of teachers try to make things seem more difficult than <br/>\nnecessary - to make themselves seem smarter and to elevate their status <br/>\nand, yes, to justify their salaries.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother student said, &quot;She is really good at putting economics into the <br/>\nlamest terms.&quot;  At first I was taken aback by that one - then realized <br/>\nthe student meant &quot;layman&#39;s terms.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - this is a HUGE difference between parents versus teachers. I&#39;m <br/>\nnot sure that this has really ever been discussed much by homeschoolers <br/>\n- but I think a LOT of teachers try to make learning material seem more <br/>\ndifficult than it is because that&#39;s the  justification for their job. <br/>\nThey very frequently require students to learn a ridiculous amount of <br/>\ntrivial material that will be promptly forgotten as soon as the test is <br/>\nover - and everybody KNOWS it, but nobody admits it. Taking a look at <br/>\ntests proves it. For example, the test bank for the econ textbook I use <br/>\nhas a question that asks &quot;Which of the following is the percentage of <br/>\ntotal national income earned by the lowest 20 percent of households? (A) <br/>\n2% (B) 3% (C) 4% (D) 5%<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is so lame --- what is important is that the student knows it is a <br/>\nreally small percentage while the richest 20 percent of the households <br/>\nearn about half of all national income (and it doesn&#39;t matter if it is <br/>\n49% or 51%, either. So students have to spend time trying to remember <br/>\nEXACTLY what percentage it is and they lose track of the really <br/>\ninteresting bigger picture. Why ask them to memorize this exact number <br/>\n(which isn&#39;t even the exact number since that varies over time, <br/>\nanyway)?  Because then lots of them miss that question and the teacher <br/>\ngets to give them a lower grade which makes it seem like the teacher <br/>\nknows so much more and the students don&#39;t and again, justifies the <br/>\nteacher&#39;s job and salary.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Where are my blind spots?!","postDate":"1316552712","msgId":63048,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJDRjQ1NzFGLUY1OEMtNEEwOC05NTE5LTczNjVBMzVFRjQ2M0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGo1YXRnNis0dXVyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGo1YXRnNis0dXVyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":63047,"nextInTopic":63054,"prevInTime":63047,"nextInTime":63049,"topicId":63003,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- As a child, up until about 18 most decisions were made for me, and I had little or no say in the matter.

I hyped it up, talked about the host&#39;s kid the same age as my older son,  made an extra-special breakfast that morning, had the boys sleep in the clothes they&#39;d wear, made their favorite cookies as my contribution to the potluck and set aside some for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, when the time came, my almost-6-year-old son said he didn&#39;t want to go.

It was set up that you had to pay in advance.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I thought the boys would love it - a castle / fort ruins, by the sea, with a real wartime plane in the grounds that you can go inside and look around.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I had told the boys about the trip a few days ago, then yesterday and then this morning.  When I talked about it this morning my eldest immediately said he didn&#39;t want to go - that he wanted an &#39;at home&#39; day playing with the new Lego Skull Truck they just bought and made.  I asked my youngest what he would like to do today and he said he also wanted to stay home.  I explained to the boys that the trip had been organised for a while and we were going with other home ed families and that I had already paid for it.  I asked them why they didn&#39;t want to go and it wasn&#39;t to do with the place we were planning to go, it was their desire to be home and play with the new Lego skull truck.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So I said I would think about what they said and I went and rang a friend.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I talked through the various thoughts in my head - that I&#39;d already paid for the event and couldn&#39;t get my money back, but I didn&#39;t fancy driving with unhappy kids who may or may not have a good day, that I didn&#39;t have the number for the organiser, but i could obviously find this out somehow!, that i was really looking forward to going to the Fort because it was built during King Henry viii&#39;s reign and that&#39;s a bit of our history I&#39;ve been learning about this summer, remembering the excitement i used to have about new toys and knowing that this new Lego truck is something the boys have saved for together and i couldn&#39;t see a practical way to take the truck with us but i totally understood their desire to play with it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, by the end of the conversation i realised that ultimately my two reasons for still wanting to go were the money i&#39;d already paid and the fact that i didn&#39;t have the organiser&#39;s number.  ultimately, the money is just money.  we don&#39;t have a lot of it but i&#39;ve paid it either way and i&#39;d rather pay for a happy day at home than a potentially grumpy day away.  As for the organiser&#39;s number - I&#39;m 33 yrs old, bright and resourceful - how hard can it be to find a number?!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; so i decided to respect the boys&#39; preference to stay at home.  and i felt relief and i felt good about it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; but so far this morning I&#39;ve been feeling flat. I&#39;m trying to shift my thoughts around but being at home and not having any plans is giving me space to realise how tired i feel!  i just want to snuggle on the sofa with a movie!

Once the commitment is made, we attend. I look for things they are interested in so that I know they will enjoy the trip.  I also try to incorporate new things to spark their interest. If it is something they end up not enjoying so much, and perhaps have not picked themselves (such as the over packed Natural History Museum the last time we went), we keep the trip short, and explain that we wish to see the new exhibit before we go.  They understand this, and usually after a few minutes have found something they love (dioramas are the big hit these days!) <br/>\n <br/>\nMy children are almost the same age as yours (6 ½ and 5 in October), but I wouldn&#39;t give them complete control over what we do as a family, even if they were older.

(On a side note, if this was a more permanent thing, such as weekly lessons and they were unhappy, I would give them a choice as that is different to me.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat has helped us is to have the boys pick out their clothes the night before (they are not morning people), and to make sure we pack a lunch/snack for them, as well as have the car stocked up with things they would like to do during the drive, even a short one. <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-As little children its essential that we&#39;re meeting their needs, and then we are modeling that for them, but when and how does the transition happen that they also start doing that in return? -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce when I was 16 and in the middle of a huge argument with my mother I told her I was never going to have children because &quot;when you have kids you should give them everything you have and expect nothing&quot;  When my eldest was born (17 years later) I remembered this fight so clearly. I don&#39;t expect my boys to do anything for  me at the moment. However, they will help me do something when I least expect it, and haven&#39;t asked.  I have also watched both my boys play with toddlers/babies (under 2), and seen how gentle and caring they are.  (Not how they wrestle each other at home) To me this shows that they understand about helping others and meeting others needs.

Would you see it as an executive decision and if so based on what?  Or something else?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m trying to understand this fully.  I think I understand that your saying by a kid canceling out plans whenever they want its basically leading to the kid ruling the house instead of how the adults would in a more mainstream household?  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf so where do you draw the line or I mean how do you create it so that the children also respect the parents needs / desires?  <br/>\nAs little children its essential that we&#39;re meeting their needs, and then we are modelling that for them, but when and how does the transition happen that they also start doing that in return?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nEmma<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-Anyway, by the end of the conversation i realised that ultimately my two reasons for still wanting to go were the money i&#39;d already paid and the fact that i didn&#39;t have the organiser&#39;s number. ultimately, the money is just money. we don&#39;t have a lot of it but i&#39;ve paid it either way and i&#39;d rather pay for a happy day at home than a potentially grumpy day away.

It was set up that you had to pay in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought the boys would love it - a castle / fort ruins, by the sea, with a real wartime plane in the grounds that you can go inside and look around.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had told the boys about the trip a few days ago, then yesterday and then this morning.  When I talked about it this morning my eldest immediately said he didn&#39;t want to go - that he wanted an &#39;at home&#39; day playing with the new Lego Skull Truck they just bought and made.  I asked my youngest what he would like to do today and he said he also wanted to stay home.  I explained to the boys that the trip had been organised for a while and we were going with other home ed families and that I had already paid for it.  I asked them why they didn&#39;t want to go and it wasn&#39;t to do with the place we were planning to go, it was their desire to be home and play with the new Lego skull truck.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I said I would think about what they said and I went and rang a friend.<br/>\n<br/>\nI talked through the various thoughts in my head - that I&#39;d already paid for the event and couldn&#39;t get my money back, but I didn&#39;t fancy driving with unhappy kids who may or may not have a good day, that I didn&#39;t have the number for the organiser, but i could obviously find this out somehow!, that i was really looking forward to going to the Fort because it was built during King Henry viii&#39;s reign and that&#39;s a bit of our history I&#39;ve been learning about this summer, remembering the excitement i used to have about new toys and knowing that this new Lego truck is something the boys have saved for together and i couldn&#39;t see a practical way to take the truck with us but i totally understood their desire to play with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, by the end of the conversation i realised that ultimately my two reasons for still wanting to go were the money i&#39;d already paid and the fact that i didn&#39;t have the organiser&#39;s number.  ultimately, the money is just money.  we don&#39;t have a lot of it but i&#39;ve paid it either way and i&#39;d rather pay for a happy day at home than a potentially grumpy day away.  As for the organiser&#39;s number - I&#39;m 33 yrs old, bright and resourceful - how hard can it be to find a number?!<br/>\n<br/>\nso i decided to respect the boys&#39; preference to stay at home.  and i felt relief and i felt good about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nbut so far this morning I&#39;ve been feeling flat. I&#39;m trying to shift my thoughts around but being at home and not having any plans is giving me space to realise how tired i feel!  i just want to snuggle on the sofa with a movie!  I have asked the boys if they fancy a movie but they are more than happy playing with their lego truck! maybe i could put a movie on anyway!<br/>\n<br/>\nso, where are my blindspots, what might i have done differently, what am i missing, how do i shift into the new plan for the day?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nBea</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63049,"nextTopicId":62904}}
