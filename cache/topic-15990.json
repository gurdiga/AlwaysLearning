We talk lots about being a good<br/>\nsport and what that means. He is a stomper even for<br/>\nbeing told no. I think it is some kids personality. My<br/>\nthird son Jessy , who is 12, climbed a tree to get a<br/>\nsoccerball for some kids they were playing with. Levi<br/>\nwas angry because Jessy got the ball before he could..<br/>\n&quot;I just wanted to be man of the hour&quot;. I have never<br/>\nused that expression and do not dub winners and losers<br/>\nin our family. Levi has a very strong personality and<br/>\nI have times of being worried about him too.  He is<br/>\nalso a tender heart and when you get down to it he is<br/>\nvery gentle and kind. I am trying to really focus on<br/>\nthat side of his nature. Thank him when he is<br/>\nincluding of his little sister. Tell him how much I<br/>\nappreciate how he handles a situation when he keep<br/>\ncontrol of his temper. Levi is also prone to making<br/>\nstories up to make himself look better. He is also the<br/>\nkid who walked back to shore seven times as the boys<br/>\nwent ahead to help his next youngest sister who kept<br/>\nchanging her mind if she was brave enough to wade. He<br/>\nnever lost patience or said enough. They,the boys,<br/>\nwere quite far ahead when I said go on to him she was<br/>\nnot going to make it today. Keep faith in his goodness<br/>\nand trust yourself and him to help him be his best<br/>\nself. <br/>\nKathleen<br/>\n--- Betsy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ecsamhill@...\">ecsamhill@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; **Now a little bit more info.

They were bending over to pick it up. To check it out or take? I do not know. I casually talked loudly and tols Riley to remember to get his bike. The boys put the bike down and split, straight away from me bolt. This openned the doors for a very gentle discussion of the rights of people, honesty, stealing. He was very receptive having the image of his own bike possibly taken. I think he understood. We will have to see how his actions are.
