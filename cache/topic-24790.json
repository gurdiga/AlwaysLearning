For me it&#39;s not that I quit, you know I&#39;m out of here.   <br/>\nFor me I need to explore other options, I am always exploring.  My  <br/>\nlist of what I have taught myself came after quitting violin, guitar,  <br/>\nclarinet, track, swimming, girl scouts.  I taught myself, gardening,  <br/>\nquilting, sewing, crafting, pottery, cooking, knitting, theory on  <br/>\nhomeschool education to some degree, drywalling, paintng,  <br/>\nconstruction framing, tiling, how to install a sink, a toliet, a  <br/>\nphone line, how to sand floors and stain them and I am always  <br/>\nteaching myself to be true to myself.  Yes, sometimes I go years  <br/>\nwithout making pottery, or quilting, but I always come back when the  <br/>\nhunger is there, and I always allow myself to.  What a great feeling.<br/>\n<br/>\nRaven<br/>\nMama to Tristan 8, Kess 6 and Wynn 3<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://scatterville.blogspot.com\">http://scatterville.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mar 20, 2006, at 6:59 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;  Quitting (was Re: new member and a question)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24788,"nextTopicId":24810}}
