I enjoyed your website.  I do have some problems with  <br/>\nyour approach to telling your kids about pornography.  I get from  <br/>\nyour writing that you have an adverse reaction to anything that might  <br/>\nresemble or imply &quot;discipline,&quot; as you seem to have remembered it.   <br/>\nAlbeit from your family or families you knew, I don&#39;t think  <br/>\nbanishment or the word &quot;no&quot; or an ominous tone of voice are  <br/>\nparticularly harmful to a kid&#39;s self-esteem or their understanding.   <br/>\nSometimes you have to understand that kids already understand that it  <br/>\nIS wrong.  It seemed that your son DID understand that.  Instincts,  <br/>\nlife experience, and having a good mom taught him that before he was  <br/>\neven 12.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s very important to not fall into a category of &quot;cool&quot; mom or the  <br/>\nlaid back one just to appease your kids.  Seeing fear in your kids  <br/>\neyes is not always a bad thing.  After all, you want your kid to be  <br/>\nafraid to jump off a cliff, not slickly talked out of it with a Dairy  <br/>\nQueen blizzard in hand.  Sometimes there is no other way than to say,  <br/>\n&quot;NO.  HELL NO.&quot;  You don&#39;t always have to explain yourself.  Your kid  <br/>\nshould trust your judgement.  And you should trust and accept that  <br/>\nyour kid will not like you all the time.  Just because a situation is  <br/>\nuncomfortable for you and your kid does not mean that it is damaging  <br/>\nto them.      This is food for thought.  Perhaps you&#39;ve thought about  <br/>\nmuch of this.  Let me know what you think.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>\n--------------<br/>\nSo...<br/>\nI was already bristly from phrases like &quot;...&#39;discipline,&#39; as you seem  <br/>\nto have remembered it&quot; and the implication that I could or would  <br/>\nwrite as much as I&#39;ve written based on my families or families I knew  <br/>\n(though I suppose some people have written much more based on much  <br/>\nless)...   and here was my response.   The writing he chose to call  <br/>\nmy &quot;porn article&quot; is this:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/sex\">http://sandradodd.com/sex</a><br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>\n---------------<br/>\n<br/>\n\tFrom: \t  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a><br/>\n\tSubject: \tRe: about your porn article<br/>\n\tDate: \tMarch 23, 2007 8:31:44 AM MDT<br/>\n\tTo:<br/>\n<br/>\n#1, I don&#39;t have &quot;a porn article&quot; and I nearly deleted your e-mail  <br/>\nunread as spam.  Be careful what you name things.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- Perhaps you&#39;ve thought about much of this.  Let me know what you  <br/>\nthink.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ve already found a website that lets you know what I think.<br/>\nI&#39;ve thought about ALL of what you wrote, for years.<br/>\nYou haven&#39;t thought about all of what I wrote, though, and are  <br/>\nalready in the process of rejecting it.  So I understand your point  <br/>\nof view and mine as well, while you only understand yours and seem to  <br/>\nwant me to take mine back.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=Albeit from your family or families you knew, I don&#39;t think  <br/>\nbanishment or the word &quot;no&quot; or an ominous tone of voice are  <br/>\nparticularly harmful to a kid&#39;s self-esteem or their understanding.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is quite belittling of my experience:  &quot;your family or families  <br/>\nyou knew.&quot;    I can&#39;t help but think of hundreds of kids I taught,  <br/>\nhundreds of unschooling families I&#39;ve worked with (and hundreds of  <br/>\nfamilies I&#39;ve worked with a little in which unschooling failed  <br/>\nbecause the parents clung to things that hampered it), and the  <br/>\nhundreds of families I&#39;ve known in my life of observing people.   <br/>\nPeople also tend to tell me their life stories in detail; always  <br/>\nhave.  My knowledge isn&#39;t just based on my family and families I knew  <br/>\n(why the past tense there!?).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-After all, you want your kid to be afraid to jump off a cliff, not  <br/>\nslickly talked out of it with a Dairy Queen blizzard in hand.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have never desired to jump off a cliff.  I have two friends  <br/>\nwho killed themselves when they were 14 and 15.  They didn&#39;t jump off  <br/>\na cliff, each used a gun.  Their parents said &quot;NO&quot; a lot.  Their  <br/>\nparents wouldn&#39;t have &quot;let&quot; them shoot themselves in the head, and  <br/>\nyet they chose, even though they were surely afraid, to shoot  <br/>\nthemselves in the head rather than wake up the next day still in that  <br/>\nfamily.  If a kid would decide not to jump for an ice cream treat, he  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t really want to jump much.   (I&#39;ll put a link at the bottom  <br/>\nabout some of the things parents believe their kids would do if they  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t say &quot;no&quot;.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-You don&#39;t always have to explain yourself. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have to, but I have chosen to do so, since my children were  <br/>\nvery young, and my results are good.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Your kid should trust your judgement. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThey do, because I have chosen to explain myself and so they KNOW  <br/>\nthat when I tell them something I&#39;ll be able to explain why.   <br/>\nSometimes they don&#39;t even ask for the explanation because they trust  <br/>\nthat I have one.  They don&#39;t trust me out of fear, they trust me out  <br/>\nof respect and understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Just because a situation is uncomfortable for you and your kid  <br/>\ndoes not mean that it is damaging to them.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nJust because a parent thinks a kid isn&#39;t damaged doesn&#39;t mean the kid  <br/>\nisn&#39;t being damaged.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese might help you move another step away from thinking that &quot;no&quot;  <br/>\nnever hurts, if you&#39;re interested.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/ifilet\">http://sandradodd.com/ifilet</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/yes\">http://sandradodd.com/yes</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/choices\">http://sandradodd.com/choices</a><br/>\n<br/>\n=========================<br/>\n(end of quotes)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28325,"nextTopicId":28358}}
