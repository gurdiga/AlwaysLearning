Every time a letter was traded (I&#39;ll trade <br/>\nyou a T for a B), it reinforced the names of the letters.  McKenna, my <br/>\nthird, played mostly independently, simply matching the letters to to <br/>\nboard and when she wasn&#39;t sure of one, she would ask.  Over the course <br/>\nof a week in which she played every day, she became sure of every <br/>\nletter, the game was put away and hasn&#39;t been brought out again since.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now, I hope, I realize that they will find games to help them learn <br/>\nwhat they want to learn, when they want to learn it, and I don&#39;t have <br/>\nulterior motives when I buy a game anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam, I was really tempted to buy those mythological card games though.  <br/>\nWould my children really *finally* learn their times tables?

We really<br/>\ndon&#39;t.  I knew I was going to unschool before they<br/>\nwere born, some 15 years ago.  I have just been more<br/>\npassionate about it for about 10 years (since I have<br/>\nhad kids.)  It&#39;s easier though, with people who really<br/>\ndon&#39;t care, who are entrenched and invested, as Sandra<br/>\ndescribed, or who just don&#39;t get it.

So, maybe my experience in the U.S.<br/>\nspoiled me for life in the north of England.  Maybe by sheer<br/>\npopulation density of homeschoolers I was able to find more<br/>\nlike-minded people in Albuquerque than I can find around here.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are three groups of home-educator that I see up here: the first<br/>\nand largest are the reactive home-educators.  Those home-educators who<br/>\ntook their child out of school because they were bullied so badly that<br/>\nthe child became suicidal or whose child has a special needs issue<br/>\nthat the schools weren&#39;t adequately addressing.  These families are<br/>\nvery interested in following a curriculum.  Their reasons for pulling<br/>\nout of school have nothing to do with the educational structure, but<br/>\nwith the deleterious social aspects for their own child.  So, they<br/>\nmimic the school structure:  very carefully following some sort of<br/>\nstructured system.  I know one family whose son is working more than<br/>\n40 hours a week preparing for GCSE through some accelerated program<br/>\nwhich means he has no time for much else in his life.  The family&#39;s<br/>\nstated priority is making sure that at 16 their son will be able to<br/>\nget a job, or get into a college that will get him into a University<br/>\nthat will get him into a job.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second type I know home-educate for religious reasons.  Schools<br/>\nhave too much going on about evolution and don&#39;t prioritize family<br/>\nover state.  Again, this philosophy has nothing to do with throwing<br/>\noff the bonds of curriculum based education.  There are more<br/>\nalternative approaches: the vicar&#39;s family who use a Charlotte Mason<br/>\napproach and love to brag about how they have no television; the<br/>\nMormon mother who upon first meeting told me that she had an<br/>\nunschooling lean to her approach, by which she meant that she would<br/>\nallow her children to stay with a subject for longer than she had<br/>\nplanned if they were really interested, say hieroglyphics, and who<br/>\ntold me to shut-up once when I said that my children would be more<br/>\ninterested in playing with their friends than in being organized into<br/>\nactivities by their friends parents.  But the discussions that I read<br/>\nreferences to on the e-mail lists suggest that everyone wants to<br/>\ncompare their curriculum and their workbooks and their approaches to<br/>\nnumeracy and literacy whatever their alternative to the national<br/>\ncurriculum may be.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe third type is the truly alternative type.  The people who are<br/>\nchoosing to home-educate because it fits in with their lifestyle<br/>\nchoices.  They have nutritionists and holistic therapists and are<br/>\nvegan, or wish they had the dedication to be, and insist that their<br/>\nchildren be vegan as well.  They have conversations about what kind of<br/>\nblood type diet they should be on. As parents the key educational<br/>\nlesson they seem to want to give is that sharing is the most important<br/>\nthing.  If any item is in question they will give it to someone not<br/>\ntheir child as it is more important that they teach their child to<br/>\ndefer their own needs to someone else&#39;s than that they (the parent)<br/>\ntake the time to help the other child or their own to come up with a<br/>\ncompromise or some alternative play.  In my experience the children<br/>\nfrom these backgrounds are less socially adept, less sure of<br/>\nthemselves.  If they get something that they really enjoy they hide it<br/>\nand fight for it and hope that the argument stays quiet enough that<br/>\ntheir parents don&#39;t notice and take away the coveted item.  There is<br/>\negotism to this kind of home-education that the other two don&#39;t seem<br/>\nto have as much of, a sense that home-education was less about helping<br/>\ntheir child and more about adding to their alternative legitimacy,<br/>\nlike a tattoo or a tongue stud or whatever.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut these are all generalities and bitter generalities at that.  I<br/>\nfind that there are people who are interested in our approach to<br/>\nhome-education.  But they are more interested in Singapore Maths or in<br/>\ndiscussing what Charlotte Mason meant by an enlightened education (or<br/>\nwhatever it is). Being religious or vegan or having a child who was<br/>\nbullied isn&#39;t a predisposition to curriculum, but they are a different<br/>\nphilosophical approach to life that may not end up with unschooling. <br/>\nThey may not be philosophies that lead to questioning the status quo<br/>\nenough to embrace the idea that learning is in everything and that<br/>\nchildren are people and that it is at least as important to love and<br/>\nlisten to your own child as it is to get 5 A&#39;s at A-level or save a<br/>\nwhale or whatever.  And they may not be philosophies that allow them<br/>\nto ever prioritize their child&#39;s interests over their god&#39;s or over<br/>\nthat child&#39;s possible future or an animal&#39;s interests.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is hard to look at a lifestyle that is by its very nature<br/>\noppositional to your own and stay calm.  I don&#39;t talk about what we do<br/>\nor don&#39;t do anymore.  I am very rarely asked about it, and when I am<br/>\nit is by people who already know what we do and may want to get me<br/>\ngoing down some very entertaining rant.  I&#39;m good at rants.  But, if I<br/>\nstart to talk about how much we enjoy television, or bring crisps and<br/>\ncandy to the group meet-ups, or talk about Tales of Symphonia it<br/>\nbecomes more and more threatening to their deeply entrenched beliefs<br/>\nabout food and television and leisure time activities.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Chris Swift&quot; &lt;Chris@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hello<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My name is Chris Swift.
