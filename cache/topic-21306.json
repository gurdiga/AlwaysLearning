I have four children 10, 12, 14,<br/>\n& 15 and one dh. We all have our own preferences for sleeping, and I think<br/>\nthe challenge for us is making it work for all of us. My 12yo dd started<br/>\nmiddle school this year (first time in ps) by her choice. This has really<br/>\ngiven us some problems sleepwise to solve. The way our house is structured,<br/>\nyou can hear anything that&#39;s going on from most of the bedrooms. It actually<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be too bad if she closed her door, but she doesn&#39;t like to. She<br/>\nwants the light out but the door open. So we&#39;ve had some discussions, some<br/>\nof them heated, about when/if the house should be quiet. Two of the boys<br/>\ntend to hit the hay by midnight, and my 15yo has a different sleep schedule<br/>\neach day and I guess the word &quot;schedule&quot; doesn&#39;t really apply to him. He can<br/>\nbe up till dawn, or asleep at 8pm. My dh is unintentionally loud in general,<br/>\nand he has the dangest time moving around quietly. My boys like music,<br/>\nmovies, TV, video games, and goofing off together, and they do these things<br/>\nat all awake hours. It is hard for them to remember that someone is trying<br/>\nto sleep. Some of the solutions they have come up with together include<br/>\nfinding where they can be in the house to be louder that dh won&#39;t hear so<br/>\nmuch, dh is wearing earplugs, she is trying to sleep with her door closed, I<br/>\nsometimes go to bed with her with the door closed, etc. I guess the<br/>\nimportant thing for us in this situation was that we listened to each other<br/>\nand tried to come up with ways to respect everyone&#39;s needs. It is in process<br/>\nstill, but mostly works okay for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone mentioned that when someone wants to be up to do something with a<br/>\nschedule, like attend school, the inspiration is there to do it. That is<br/>\ncertainly the case at our house as well. My 15yo has weekly film production<br/>\nsessions that start at 9 and he hasn&#39;t missed a one, even though he&#39;s the<br/>\none that is most likely to still be up at dawn. My daughter hasn&#39;t been late<br/>\nfor school yet. If I made them do these things, I imagine it wouldn&#39;t work.<br/>\nAnd I like Sandra&#39;s words about looking at what the day ahead requires for<br/>\nsleep. That&#39;s the kind of structure we work with as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy Holidays!<br/>\nJacki</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99391457,"authorName":"Eric Donato","from":"Eric Donato &lt;edonato953@...&gt;","profile":"juleskim2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] One unusual sleep schedule was Out of lurkdom","postDate":"1103658034","msgId":21346,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJFNTYyQjBFLTUzODgtMTFEOS05QjUzLTAwMDM5MzEzQzcyNEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQxMjIxMTEyMy4xY0dQQjc3bFIzTlpGcE8wQG14LWEwNjViMTkucGFzLnNhLmVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDQxMjIxMTEyMy4xY0dQQjc3bFIzTlpGcE8wQG14LWEwNjViMTkucGFzLnNhLmVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":21345,"nextInTopic":21347,"prevInTime":21345,"nextInTime":21347,"topicId":21306,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Rebecca, that s great!

Not &quot;3 am every night&quot;--that&#39;s as inflexible as 8:30 very night.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe principles regarding sleep are that sleep has a biological purpose and <br/>\nthe clock doesn&#39;t know when people are sleepy.   People WILL sleep.  They must <br/>\nsleep.  They LIKE to sleep, when they&#39;re sleepy.   People NEED to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven all that, the &quot;when&quot; of sleeping has to do with consideration for <br/>\nothers.  Is the person (child or adult) scheduled to be somewhere the next day?  We <br/>\nsay &quot;Count backward...&quot; here and it means when do you need to get up?  How <br/>\nmany hours will you have slept if you go to sleep now?  In an hour?  When do you <br/>\nneed to go to sleep to be sufficiently prepared for tomorrow?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf &quot;tomorrow&quot; isn&#39;t &quot;a school day&quot; but has its own individual unique <br/>\ntomorrowness, then each evening&#39;s decisions are likewise unique.   If tomorrow is <br/>\n&quot;nothing scheduled,&quot; a child who&#39;s actively engaged in something at midnight has <br/>\nno read reason to go to sleep just because something *might* happen at 9:00 the <br/>\nnext day.  Something *is* happening at midnight.  So the priorities of <br/>\nlearning and of living with awareness in the moment trump the &quot;maybe&quot; of an <br/>\nunscheduled tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd another consideration is for them to be quiet and not disturb those who <br/>\nare asleep.   For our kids, the privilege of being up later than the neighbors <br/>\nand parents has always been contingent on them doing it so quietly that it&#39;s <br/>\nnot an inconvenience for anyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"designarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"One unusual sleep schedule was Out of lurkdom","postDate":"1103304229","msgId":21338,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PGNwdjBhbituMXFwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":21337,"nextInTopic":21339,"prevInTime":21337,"nextInTime":21339,"topicId":21306,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-673061677\">&lt;&lt;&lt;I&#39;d like to hear stories from the other side-Kids Stayed up Until 3 <br/>\nam Every Night-Brains Intact-No Mush Here, Officials State.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how well this applies, since Jayn is 5, but this is how our<br/>\nsleep schedule works. I am reposting from another list, since nothing much<br/>\nhas changed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlightly modified Quote begins:<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn is recently 5 and continues to live in the rotating sleep pattern that<br/>\nhas become the norm at our house. <br/>\n<br/>\nJayn lives on a 26-28 hour day. She sleeps for close to 10 hours and then<br/>\nstays awake for 16 - 18. Since the world is rotating once every 24 hours,<br/>\nthis means we (she and I) are on a permanent slow march around the clock.<br/>\nSometimes she divides her sleep into two 5 hour sessions on a completely<br/>\nunpredictable basis. In our household we are generally over the course of a<br/>\nmonth or 5 weeks spending about a third of that time on a &quot;night shift&quot; when<br/>\nJayn gets up in the early evening and goes to be after the sun has risen.<br/>\nAnother part of the time she is getting up in the middle of the night and<br/>\ngoing to bed in the mid afternoon - this is usually when she will take a nap<br/>\nand somehow flip around to being on either nights or days. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe has never had a set bedtime, and when a toddler simply went to sleep<br/>\nwith us. Dh and I were fortunate in that he was at home after a knee<br/>\nreplacement for the vast majority of her young life, so he and I were able<br/>\nto have our adult together time in the morning. Recently he has returned to<br/>\nwork in the film business, on a varying schedule, so one of the limiting<br/>\nfactors in how I am able to cope with the pushing through to nights is the<br/>\nneed to avoid disturbing his rest. In the past, Jayn has been able to be<br/>\nawake for a couple of extra hours in the bedroom watching tv and asking<br/>\nperiodically for a snack, while I snoozed. Now that dynamic occurs with me<br/>\non the increasingly uncomfortable (as we both age) sofa.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn is not comfortable being alone and lonely during the nights, so I stay<br/>\nwith her. These quiet, intense times have been the scene of some of our most<br/>\nenriched imaginative games and discussions. They can be wonderful nights. It<br/>\nis only when she does her sudden flips that I have a serious tiredness<br/>\nproblem. When she moves into it gradually, I am able to just follow her,<br/>\nstill usually getting up an hour or so sooner than she awakens. I keep<br/>\nmyself alert by typing on the computer sometimes [or sewing], when she is<br/>\nengaged with her dolls. Sometimes she watches DVD&#39;s, and there are times<br/>\nwhen I watch some other DVD&#39;s on my computer or the portable player at the<br/>\nsame time. <br/>\n<br/>\nBeing up all night has some restrictions that are not manifest during the<br/>\nday. The first is obviously the need for quiet. Luckily our apartments have<br/>\nwonderfully thick walls, and have all been soundproofed by the Los Angeles<br/>\nAirport Authority. I have to help Jayn avoid jumping games, as we are on the<br/>\nsecond floor. She gets her activity by doing sofa jumping, cycling on the<br/>\nexercise bike, and after the sun comes up. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other restriction is the limited social contact she has during that 10<br/>\nday(night) period. We struggle to get to her dance class (1pm on Tuesdays)<br/>\nand the park playdate following. Sometimes she is literally getting out of<br/>\nbed to rush to class, at other times, about to go to bed as soon as we get<br/>\nhome. I would expect her to miss one every now and then, but so far the<br/>\nenjoyment she gets out of class has motivated her to get up and go, even<br/>\nwhen sleepy. [Except for one time, when she was just too tired to get up<br/>\nafter only 3 hours of sleep - so missed one class in a 10 week session] In a<br/>\nway it is worse since it interrupts the cycle and I am the one getting<br/>\ninsufficient rest when these jumps occur.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she is on a day schedule, I get her outdoors as often as possible. Up<br/>\nuntil a couple of weeks ago [now about 2 months] we were swimming whenever<br/>\nwe awoke during daylight hours. We have an understanding group of home<br/>\nschooling friends who never call here before 10am and are kind about making<br/>\nplaydates in the afternoon. We have a sorta kinda regular Friday playdate,<br/>\nthat we can cancel with one phone call without rancor. It is a fine balance<br/>\nbetween going places at a certain time and how long the drive home then is -<br/>\nsometimes a nap during that drive is utterly disastrous. It only takes 15<br/>\nminutes of sleeping for Jayn to be refreshed enough for seven more energetic<br/>\nhours, regardless of when she awoke that &quot;morning&quot;. Awakening her when she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t wish to get up is futile. She has chosen to miss birthday parties<br/>\nand sleep instead. Trying to manipulate her into sleeping - even with<br/>\nnursing, darkened rooms, quiet time, warm baths, valium (JUST KIDDING!) any<br/>\nkind of trick at all - is equally pointless. She has kept on playing and<br/>\nchatting happily for hours after I would have expected collapse. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only time that we ever have any kind of emotional conflict or issues<br/>\nbetween us over sleeping, is when I am not being acceptant of Jayn&#39;s<br/>\nschedule. It is true that I am sometimes tired. However I have to choose to<br/>\nnot be resentful or fight her process, or I am tired *and* grumpy. I adapt<br/>\nmy other activities - cleaning, laundry, shopping, errands - around her.<br/>\nThank goodness for 24 hour markets!<br/>\n<br/>\nDh makes time to play with Jayn when he gets home from work. Again the only<br/>\ntimes when there are conflicts [about sleeping] between us, are when he<br/>\nloses his sense of acceptance about the sleep schedule - if he is feeling<br/>\nlonely or left out. Most of the time he is a miracle of acceptance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have the expectation that this is temporary. I have been sometimes<br/>\nreassured by other Unschoolers that this will likely pass. Eventually Jayn<br/>\nmay need fewer sleep hours so her days will regulate back to being 24 hours<br/>\nlong. Also she will gradually become more self sufficient and less needy of<br/>\ncompany or assistance, so in time I will be free to follow my own preference<br/>\nof sleeping, which is to go to bed between midnight and 2am and rise around<br/>\n10-10.30am. (Theater hours) For all I know she will become the same morning<br/>\nperson my dh is. Or she may be a night owl, which is what I suspect.<br/>\n<br/>\nI occasionally talk to her about what she is missing by being awake at night<br/>\ninstead of during the day. She often talks about activities she wants to be<br/>\npart of - such as ice skating or gymnastics. I will have to make sure that<br/>\nthese classes are not early in the morning. Our ability to get to something<br/>\nregularly scheduled before 11am would often be pretty impaired by both my<br/>\ntiredness and her schedule. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe eat at appropriate times (ie when we are hungry but that is about every<br/>\n4-5 hours with odd snacks between for Jayn) relative to when we get out of<br/>\nbed, rather than the clock. Often this means Jayn and I are eating our lunch<br/>\nor breakfast with dh who is having dinner. Jayn tends to eat a lot of one<br/>\nthing at each sitting, and a bite or two of the other parts - like a lot of<br/>\nchicken, a lot of potato, a lot of broccoli, a lot of chocolate chip<br/>\ncookies, a lot of turkey ham sandwiches, a lot of apple - but it all<br/>\nbalances out over the course of her day or week.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that the way we live with Jayn&#39;s rotating sleep schedule is probably<br/>\nout on the extreme edge of child led living. But it really is easier than<br/>\nthe alternative - a constant struggle with Jayn over her sleeping. One of<br/>\nthe reasons we were drawn to homeschooling in the first place was to be free<br/>\nfrom early mornings for someone else&#39;s convenience. Jayn has always had the<br/>\nopportunity and freedom to sleep when she wanted to, so I have to believe<br/>\nthat this schedule is natural to her. Fortunately we have a lifestyle that<br/>\npermits us to honor her unusual needs. There are others that would not -<br/>\nbeing farmers, needing two incomes, having multiple children - so I am not<br/>\nrecommending it, just offering a description.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe opportunity to write about this, and remind myself that my attitude is<br/>\nwhat the makes to most difference to my happiness, at any time of the day or<br/>\nnight, is very much appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
