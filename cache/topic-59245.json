A friend of mine (longtime friend, 15 years) is up for a metro court judge position, and I wrote a letter to the governor.  The decision is made next week.  He&#39;s young to be a judge.   If he doesn&#39;t get this one (there are six people being considered), he&#39;ll get another one someday.    He was my protege in the SCA, a formal relationship.  Last month Holly and I went to see him installed as the Grand Master of his Masonic lodge.  He and his wife lost one of twins in utero a couple of years ago, and had another baby three weeks ago.  I really, really like him. I brag him up a lot.   His name in the SCA is Balthazar.  In real life he&#39;s Jonathan Ibarra, assistant district attorney.<br/>\n<br/>\nI brag my friend Jeff up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI brag up Pam, Joyce, Deb Lewis, Jenny C, Schuyler... <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t wait until they&#39;re listening to do that.  I do it flat out behind their backs.  And sometimes on this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tell people that Lori Odhner is great and I share her writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe more people should brag up other people more often so their kids are just some of a larger group of positively-spoken-of people in their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t do that to manipulate anyone or to gain anything for myself, but I DO gain something, because I&#39;m accustomed to looking for what&#39;s cool and interesting and beneficial to others.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the letter I wrote today:<br/>\n<br/>\n2905 Tahiti Ct. NE<br/>\n<br/>\nAlbuquerque NM  87112<br/>\n<br/>\nJanuary 26, 2011<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nTo the Honorable Susana Martinez, Governor of New Mexico,<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the consideration of Jonathan Ibarra for Metro Court Judge<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n Dear Governor Martinez:<br/>\n<br/>\n I wish to share some of what I have learned about Jonathan Ibarra.  I have known Jon Ibarra for fifteen years, since he was an undergraduate and working at a grocery store to put himself through school.<br/>\n<br/>\n Several times over the years, I have organized sessions of philosophy discussions, at which participants would discuss virtues and ethics, both in their historical settings and in ways we could apply to our own lives.  Jon never missed those.  Even when he got to the point that he knew all of what would be discussed, he still came to help out younger, newer members of the discussions.  He could be relied on to explain things clearly and calmly if I became flustered or frustrated with someone else&#39;s arguments or confusion.<br/>\n<br/>\n Jon&#39;s clarity and integrity have continued to impress me, in all aspects of his life. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother personal trait worth noting is that Jon maintains his friendships over the years.  When he was installed in a high position recently in a service organization to which he belongs, the building overflowed with friends and relatives who had come to the ceremony.  The caterer was a former girlfriend.  Not only do his friends find no fault in him, others who were hesitant to know or like him have eventually became admirers as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Jon graduated from law school and friends asked me what I thought, I said &quot;He&#39;ll be a judge someday.&quot;  He is the calmest and most fair-minded person I know.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your time and consideration.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] plainly and directly (being and speaking)","postDate":"1296190118","msgId":59278,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRENDI0QUE2LjgwMjA3MDZAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlub3lzeFI5dCtZaHc5ZTduTnZMQ2RyaU1CN05lUHRXcEFmRCtDSkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDI4MkI2OEJGLUI1QTUtNDgxNi05NEUxLTBGNkM2RUQwQjE1NUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JPDdGNzc3NzkzRTA5MzQ1Q0E4QzVENTRCQUE5N0Q1MTY5QENvbm5pZVBDPgk8NkQzQ0VFODMtMTVFQy00RDgyLUI0QzYtRTJBNDI2QzU3NzI4QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPgk8MTI5NjEzMDA0MS4zMjc1Mi4xNDE3NTEwMTQ1QHdlYm1haWwubWVzc2FnaW5nZW5naW5lLmNvbT4JPEJERkFGNjUwLUU3RDctNDgzNi04NzU1LTJCN0JEQzM0QTI1QUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPEFBTkxrVGlub3lzeFI5dCtZaHc5ZTduTnZMQ2RyaU1CN05lUHRXcEFmRCtDSkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":59277,"nextInTopic":59279,"prevInTime":59277,"nextInTime":59279,"topicId":59245,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I really noticed it the last time I visited.  Actually, without<br/>\nmy fully understanding it, this pattern of relating to children was<br/>\nsomething I was having a lot of anxiety about before visiting, especially<br/>\nimagining it directed at our son.  Most actions in our families are<br/>\nevaluated as good or bad, and met with either high praise or condemnation.<br/>\n For example, our son sat down to write something on a piece of paper and<br/>\nthat was met with a lot of attention and encouragement.  In contrast, he<br/>\ntried to engage them in a game he was playing on the iPad (Osmos--a very<br/>\ninteresting game), and was met with distance and discouraging words.  He<br/>\nhelped with the dishes--praise.  He didn&#39;t eat everything on his plate<br/>\nduring dinner--negative comments.  He didn&#39;t seem to care to much either<br/>\nway, because he is not exposed to this on a regular basis, but I was tied in<br/>\nknots about it.  At one point, my mom said to me (I&#39;m 40 years old), &quot;Good<br/>\ngirl&quot; when I brought her a tea.  A light bulb went off in my head at that<br/>\nvery moment.  What I noticed about myself, was that I was constantly fishing<br/>\nfor the positive, and felt the need to hide what I knew would meet negative<br/>\nreviews.  I find this translates into my life away from parents.  Not<br/>\nbalanced at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a while I tried not to praise at all at home, but I realized we all like<br/>\nthe encouragement, when it comes from a sincere place, and not a place of<br/>\ncontrol.

My 9yo son...you have to be careful about the positive things you say to him, because he&#39;s so incredibly literal. If you say he&#39;s the most handsome (outside of the silliness above), he&#39;ll point out a list of ten people more handsome than he is.  When I complimented his drumming one day, he said in a very negative tone, &quot;You&#39;re just being *encouraging*!&quot;  Well, all right then.  ; )  We do much better when he asks me what I think and I tell him, making very sure not to *overstate* anything positive.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my 12yo son, he really wants to hear compliments throughout the day, though so much so that I wonder about where that need is coming from.  Have to think more about that. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve found to be helpful is being specific in compliments, as opposed to the general &quot;You&#39;re awesome!&quot;  Not in the weird, &quot;I really like how you put your toothbrush back in the holder&quot; way but in the &quot;that&#39;s a really cool beat you found on your drum kit&quot; way. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot giving those compliments when I think of them would seem very false to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWife to Bob<br/>\nMomma to George (12), Theo (9), Eli (6), and Oliver (18 mo)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my life wasn&#39;t funny, it would just be true, and that&#39;s unacceptable.<br/>\n                                                            -- Carrie Fisher</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] plainly and directly (being and speaking)","postDate":"1296139762","msgId":59268,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJERkFGNjUwLUU3RDctNDgzNi04NzU1LTJCN0JEQzM0QTI1QUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEyOTYxMzAwNDEuMzI3NTIuMTQxNzUxMDE0NUB3ZWJtYWlsLm1lc3NhZ2luZ2VuZ2luZS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDI4MkI2OEJGLUI1QTUtNDgxNi05NEUxLTBGNkM2RUQwQjE1NUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDdGNzc3NzkzRTA5MzQ1Q0E4QzVENTRCQUE5N0Q1MTY5QENvbm5pZVBDPiA8NkQzQ0VFODMtMTVFQy00RDgyLUI0QzYtRTJBNDI2QzU3NzI4QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8MTI5NjEzMDA0MS4zMjc1Mi4xNDE3NTEwMTQ1QHdlYm1haWwubWVzc2FnaW5nZW5naW5lLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":59266,"nextInTopic":59269,"prevInTime":59267,"nextInTime":59269,"topicId":59245,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-watching or reading Dora my kids will go round praising everything each other does, like Good farting! or Great spilling! or whatever, to make each","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-186340657\">-=-watching or reading Dora my kids will go round praising everything<br/>\neach other does, like &quot;Good farting!&quot; or &quot;Great spilling!&quot; or whatever,<br/>\nto make each other laugh.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI love those!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I&#39;ve wondered at times if this is more prevalent in the US.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe level of praise, or the recommendations against it, or both?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s common in many places for children to be treated as something other than real, whole people.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m guessing that in Ireland, even, strangers wouldn&#39;t say to you, with your husband standing there, &quot;He&#39;s the best man!&quot;   If what they&#39;re saying to the kids is positive and kind, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bad thing at all, but beginning to see how adults can unwittingly be condescending to children is worth doing.

We have a freezer in the garage, and I had finished all we had in the upstairs-in-the-kitchen fridge and freezer, and had reason to think we were out altogether.  We weren&#39;t.  It was corn dogs, bacon and butter.   I knew he was not angry, but REALLY wished I hadn&#39;t done it.  So I joked that I guess we needed to eat corndogs wrapped in bacon and fried in butter for a while.  He said that didn&#39;t sound very good.  I said they would all be used eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor dinner we had roast beef, green beans and fried potatoes.  When he was done, he said &quot;That was good.  I think it was a much better choice than the corndogs wrapped in bacon.&quot;   <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a nice way for us to get through that with some gentle humor.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe practiced on our kids, turning frustration into banter, and it has helped us, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":384255130,"authorName":"Frankie Watt","from":"&quot;Frankie Watt&quot; &lt;frankiewatt@...&gt;","profile":"frankiewatt1151","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] plainly and directly (being and speaking)","postDate":"1296130041","msgId":59266,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyOTYxMzAwNDEuMzI3NTIuMTQxNzUxMDE0NUB3ZWJtYWlsLm1lc3NhZ2luZ2VuZ2luZS5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDZEM0NFRTgzLTE1RUMtNEQ4Mi1CNEM2LUUyQTQyNkM1NzcyOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDI4MkI2OEJGLUI1QTUtNDgxNi05NEUxLTBGNkM2RUQwQjE1NUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDdGNzc3NzkzRTA5MzQ1Q0E4QzVENTRCQUE5N0Q1MTY5QENvbm5pZVBDPiA8NkQzQ0VFODMtMTVFQy00RDgyLUI0QzYtRTJBNDI2QzU3NzI4QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":59262,"nextInTopic":59268,"prevInTime":59265,"nextInTime":59267,"topicId":59245,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sandra said:----- ...

I am going to share a story from when I lived with my mother-in-law for 4 months. She was the queen of praise. If I did my own laundry, she would tell me what a good girl I was. If my girls did anything that was remotely nice or good, she would tell them, &quot;good girl&quot;. I felt like everything that she said was either a hollow praise or some kind of criticism. I honestly don&#39;t think that she knows how to praise without being condescending. I don&#39;t think she is capable of simply saying, &quot;thank you.&quot; For her and the people around her, avoiding praise all together would be a step in the right direction. She is so programmed to punish and reward that it has become second nature and the only way to deprogram would be to avoid it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I was thinking about this, I remembered the Three Stages of Unschooling that is seen here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/kellylovejoy/stages\">http://sandradodd.com/kellylovejoy/stages</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nI am wondering if stepping away from the idea of praise for a while would be helpful for those that are completely entrenched in the idea that kids must be praised. Only after you step away from it and completely stop it for a while and allow yourself some time to be deprogrammed can you truly see the difference between real heartfelt praise and the poodle praise that people use to manipulate kids. You have to be able to step away from the box of praise and manipulation. After living with my mother-in-law, I avoided all praise. I had to purge that horrible experience from mind.

It&#39;s not bad for infants, and it&#39;s great for French poodles. It&#39;s that talking-to-a-French-poodle voice, and the thoughts that go with it, that should be avoided when parents are talking to their children. Dan Vilter shared this story on the AlwaysLearning list in 2001:<br/>\nAt a park day, we were having a discussion about the usefulness of praise and sincerity. The unschoolers in the group were trying to point out the fallacy of over and insincere praise, and indirectly about treating your children as people first. After much talk getting nowhere, one of the other unschooling parents turned to me and in the French poodle voice started thanking me for all the things I had done for the group that day. Something like,&quot;Oh Dan, thank you for bringing the stove for hot cocoa. You did such a good job setting it up and heating the water! You&#39;re so strong carrying that big jug of water all by yourself!&quot; Everyone had a good laugh and the point was succinctly made.<br/>\n�Dan Vilter<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Treating them as people first.&quot; That&#39;s it. See them as people, who hear you and are thinking, and treat that respectfully. In her bookWhole Child/Whole Parent, Polly Berrien Berends, uses the term &quot;Seeing Beings.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is nice, from Amazon, when I went to get the URL for people interested in knowing more about this book:<br/>\nStatistically Improbable Phrases (SIPs): <br/>\nfreeing parent, nursing parent, sailor dog, conscious oneness, seeing being, silent knowing<br/>\nEven thinking the thoughts &quot;seeing being,&quot; &quot;silent knowing&quot; and &quot;conscious oneness&quot; are helpful to me. I&#39;ll have to look again to find &quot;sailor dog.&quot; Here&#39;s a quote from a review by a dad in Illinois:<br/>\n&quot;The philosophy of this book re-shaped my entire view of life and parenthood. Basically, once you realize that life with kids is ALL about the kids, frustration melts away and is replaced with infinite joy.&quot;<br/>\n===============================================<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m pretty sure the parent who spoke to Dan in the poodle voice as a demonstration was Pam Sorooshian.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dad in Illinois quoted near the end was Lyle Perry.   Many people here will remember him.  I heard from him last week.  His family is all together still, the boys didn&#39;t go to school, one of them is writing, his wife has her medical problems from before, but with better medications, and they are dealing now with breast cancer, but getting along with her parents now. Back when he was writing about unschooling, they all lived in Illinois near the in-laws. Then Lyle and Mary and the boys moved to Utah, and Colorado, and now all are in Florida.  Lyle&#39;s working in advertising again, too, but also wrote &quot;And since we&#39;re down in here in retired people heaven, I&#39;m also doing some condo repair/maintenance on the side.  There are some real idiots down here driving around with signs on their trucks, claiming to be &quot;maintenance specialists&quot;.  I get to follow them around and fix the stuff they screw up.

They see praise as a form of parental manipulation of the child&#39;s behavior - more subtle than blame and criticism, but harmful nonetheless. I have certainly seen parents use praise in this way. But I have also seen it take place in a way that I consider normal and healthy. After much thought, I&#39;ve come to believe that avoidance of praise in toto is &quot;throwing the baby out with the bathwater&quot;. While we should of course refrain from harmful, artificial kinds of praise, there does exist a more genuine variety that springs from the heart in a joyful way, and that gives our children what they most need: our genuine loving support.  <br/>\n-------------------<br/>\nThen were was a link with Read more... and the link is<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.naturalchild.org/jan_hunt/praise.html\">http://www.naturalchild.org/jan_hunt/praise.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the line that jumped out and scared me:  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;After much thought, I&#39;ve come to believe that avoidance of praise in toto is &quot;throwing the baby out with the bathwater.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter HOW much thought?  How much thought does it take to know that IF someone decided to avoid praise entirely that that was going too far?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve read the anti-praise writings, and the advice to elementary-school art teachers, and the danger of over-praising half-assed work in high schoolers, and I understand (well and personally) the longterm problems that can come from rewarding children with little things like gold stars, 100%, A+ and little stickers that say *fantastic!* with a happy face.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the idea that someone advising parents had to think much in order to accept that sometimes praise could be genuine and spontaneous and real did honestly surprise me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I wrote to a friend of mine to express my confused alarm (or whatever it was I was having).  I wrote &quot;I was thinking of discussing it at Always Learning, but it could be ten years old; can&#39;t tell.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis response came: <br/>\n&quot;It is in her book that was published in 2001. But, still worth discussing.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it&#39;s ten years old.  I felt better.  Kind of.  I felt better than I did when I thought that for ten years that site might have been saying &quot;don&#39;t praise children&quot; and just lately after much thought the author was thinking better of that advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I wondered how much praise I do of my now-grown children.  I do some!  When we left a multi-family gathering last month, I told my kids I was proud of them, and thanked them for not embarrassing me. :-)  They know me well enough to take it as it was, and I&#39;m sure they were glad I didn&#39;t embarrass them either.   When we got home I thanked Keith for getting us all home safely, and then I went (back) to sleep.  Somewhere in my life, &quot;thank you&quot; is mixed in with praise.<br/>\n<br/>\nI praise people who write on this list, or individual posts or phrases.  And it&#39;s not manipulation in hopes that they will write more, or write again.  It is probably encouraging, but I don&#39;t do it in order &quot;to encourage more.&quot;  (Thinking back to the rage/questions topic of the past few days.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have spoken for years against the use of poodle-voice praise (or poodle-voiced anything).  But that has to do with speaking to a child as you would to spouse or a friend--to another real human being, rather than as to a dog.   (I read lately a little bit about a family that&#39;s told their children that they are siblings of the family dogs, and they&#39;re raising their dogs as their children.... I&#39;d be curious to know how they choose to speak to all those canine and human children in the same tone of voice--which way it leans.  They weren&#39;t froofie little poodles, though, I&#39;m pretty sure, if that makes a difference.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy site has been gathering more dates on entries, though I&#39;ve tried to furnish dates on many of the quotes and passages I save, and sometimes links to the discussion it came from.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... <br/>\nI don&#39;t like the good examples give on that page.  The site itself is very useful, and the author&#39;s a nice person.  It just surprised me that this was a &quot;much thought&quot; items, and that the examples don&#39;t sound natural and real.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59196,"nextTopicId":54106}}
