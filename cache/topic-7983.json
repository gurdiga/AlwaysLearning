Do you play? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, I play recorder and guitar.  Keyboard less proficiently.  (I&#39;m going to <br/>\ndo a pump-organ accompaniment for one of the cello pieces.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut our friend Mike who rents our old house (who as Bohemond was Gunwaldt&#39;s <br/>\nsquire) had his cello stolen four or five years ago, and hadn&#39;t gotten <br/>\nanother one.  He was being made a Master of the Laurel (the big SCA arts <br/>\naward, like an order of knighthood for artisans; he&#39;s already a knight), and <br/>\nso a bunch of us went together to buy him a cello as a surprise, and so we <br/>\ncan get some live music going together again.  We used to have two cellists <br/>\nand a bass recorder player and in the past few years they&#39;ve moved, wandered <br/>\naway, etc.  So with Mike getting this cello together (it needed new strings, <br/>\nand he bought a mute for duets so he won&#39;t drown out a single &quot;opponent&quot; <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;), we&#39;re playing again!  I was over there last week going through pieces <br/>\nhe  had practiced (me on recorder) and helping pick some others.  It&#39;s cool!<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby said he wants to learn recorder too.  So I showed him a three-note <br/>\nharmony for a really pretty medieval piece called &quot;Edi Beo,&quot; which HAS to <br/>\nhave that harmony, but it&#39;s simple.  We&#39;ve done it with one vocalist (it&#39;s in <br/>\nMiddle English and my friend Barb, Holly&#39;s godmother, knows three verses by <br/>\nmemory in Middle English!) and three tuned water goblets.  That&#39;s some fun <br/>\nimpromptu music! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...  <br/>\nWe gave him a cello bought on e-bay.  A new student model made in China.  Not <br/>\nthe cello of his dreams, but not the cheapest one on earth either.  Not even <br/>\nthe second cheapest. &lt;g&gt;  (Third cheapest, maybe.)  It came with a hard case <br/>\nand soft case.  I got him a stand for it, a tuning fork, resin, a Dampit <br/>\n(humidifier) and some music.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was fun being the purchasing agent for our little company.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he got a piece of calligraphy with the names of the contributors.  Our <br/>\nfriend Maria did that.  I&#39;ll attach it.  Don&#39;t download it if you&#39;re already <br/>\nbored&lt;g&gt;  I&#39;m AElflaed.  We put the names in order of length, shortest to <br/>\nlongest, just for a randomish way to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1509055,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;Mellow geeks&quot;","postDate":"1027443568","msgId":8002,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAyMDcyMzA5NTkwMC4wMWNjYzI0MEBwb3AuaXNsYW5kbmV0LmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDE2ZC4xMGVmNTRiMS4yYTZlNTc3YkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":7983,"nextInTopic":8005,"prevInTime":8001,"nextInTime":8003,"topicId":7983,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

SCA business July 13 with the delivery <br/>\nof the gift cello, trip to Espanola (90 miles) to get my niece so she could <br/>\nattend every-day art lessons with Holly.  Driving people, extra kids, go go <br/>\ngo.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut Monday night a week ago, we went to CiCi&#39;s Pizza, Keith, two of my kids <br/>\n(Kirby was at work) and Gina my sister&#39;s daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nGina is the girl in the article about my sister&#39;s kids having a school option.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we&#39;re at the pizza place, and in walks Paul McClure.  We invited him to <br/>\nsit with us.  Paul is the dad of the family with the late readers, which is <br/>\nstill the featured article at www.unschooling.com (if you go there and click <br/>\non library, that will come up).  <br/>\n<br/>\nPaul is an ex marine and a city fire fighter.  Paul races bicycles up the <br/>\nback of the Sandia Mountains (steep; vertical mile).  Paul has two teenaged <br/>\ndaughters.  They hang around our house quite a bit.  I thought, perhaps, as <br/>\nPaul could kick the butts of our whole family if he took a mind to, that <br/>\nperhaps I might want to reassure Paul that my boys were kindly souls with <br/>\nhonorable intentions.  Or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I was trying to work up to it, saying Renee and Julie had been over a lot <br/>\nlately, with Kirby and his friends, and...  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he said, &quot;Yeah, I asked Chris (his oldest, 18, not living at home <br/>\nanymore) what he thought about that, and he said he&#39;s hung out with that <br/>\nbunch, and that he wouldn&#39;t worry about them, that they&#39;re just a bunch of <br/>\nmellow geeks.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYES!  Paul didn&#39;t want to beat my husband and sons up!<br/>\n<br/>\nHooray for mellow geekitude.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought it was a kind of rarified atmosphere, sitting there with characters <br/>\nfrom  two currently-in-view essays on kids, freedom and learning.  It was a <br/>\ncool coincidence.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7950,"nextTopicId":8009}}
