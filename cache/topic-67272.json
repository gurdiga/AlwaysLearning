While a &quot;mad scramble&quot; is a useful response to unexpected emergencies, your daughter is building a repertoire of how to respond to life and she&#39;s seeing you go into emergency scramble mode week after week after week of the same situation. Is that how you&#39;d like her to respond to cancellations as an adult?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What do you do when people cancel on your kid for reasons that seem unfair to your kid? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sympathize. Express your own feelings such as &quot;Well, that&#39;s disappointing.&quot; Every time it happens to her, she learns how not to be with others.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake your cues from her. Let her grieve for a bit if she needs it. Then tackle the problem of what to do now rather than a mad scrambled to fix her, to move her quickly to happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut first, the most important step: Come up with a list of alternatives *before* the next cancellation of what to do when that happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is full of disappointments. You can&#39;t stop the world from disappointing her. But you can handle disappointments with sympathy and calm. She will internalize the skills you use.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the problem isn&#39;t with other people canceling. That&#39;s part of life. The problem is that it keeps catching you by surprise without a back up plan ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The other family is hoping to try meeting up more this summer,<br/>\n&gt;  and I think, &quot;Gah, I like them, but I hate giving them the power to goof up our day.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Then don&#39;t give them that power :-) Build the understanding that they&#39;re likely to cancel at the last minute into your plans with your daughter. Decide with her before hand what to do if they cancel.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  It&#39;s easy to explain when someone who just had her 4th kid<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t return any of our phone calls. Other people, not so much. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sometimes people do cancel for good solid reasons and it&#39;s helpful to pass those on.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut don&#39;t make excuses for the others. Trying to make your daughter feel okay about a situation that you believe *isn&#39;t* okay for her or you to do to others is bound to confuse her! You don&#39;t need to help her understand why someone canceled. Give her the information the cancelers gave you and let *her* internalize whether that felt good or bad. You don&#39;t need to rail at the cancelers either. Her disappointment at their canceling is good enough indication to her of whether that was a good thing or a bad thing for her to do to other people.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67493,"nextTopicId":67556}}
