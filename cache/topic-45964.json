He","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-173211346\">Thank you all for sharing your stories about night time accidents. It has<br/>\nhelped me realize that maybe Damon is not quite as potty trained as I had<br/>\nthought! He really does fine during the days. But he has had several<br/>\nincidents of wetting the bed since I wrote the original post about how he<br/>\nwas pretty much potty trained in a week. <br/>\n <br/>\nDamon has always surprised me at how fast he does things. Usually it&#39;s<br/>\n&quot;early&quot; and I am not quite ready for it, like walking before 9 months. He<br/>\ncrawled at 4.5 months and climbed the stairs at 7.5 months, plus I had<br/>\nwalked that early and sort of thought he might, so it wasn&#39;t a complete<br/>\nsurprise when he let go of the furniture one day and took 5 steps, but then<br/>\nit only took about a week and he was walking around like a pro. By 10 mos he<br/>\nwas running everywhere! When I put him in the pool, he just started<br/>\nswimming. He got on a tricycle and peddled away. In general, when he wants<br/>\nto do something, he just does it! I got used to him doing things much<br/>\nearlier than his peers, so not using the potty was a shock to me when all<br/>\nthe other kids seemed to be doing it. (I was at first thankful for something<br/>\nto say when people talked about how Damon was always the first to do<br/>\nsomething, then I could say well he&#39;s still not using the potty! Not in<br/>\nfront of him of course.)<br/>\n <br/>\nSo because I started the potty post I feel I should now add about how my son<br/>\nhas been having accidents more and more. I didn&#39;t really think much of it,<br/>\nwe just changed the sheets and cleaned him up. But upon reading the other<br/>\nposts about older kids and accidents (totally me as well), I realized it has<br/>\nbeen more frequent. <br/>\n <br/>\nWe sleep in a waterbed and changing sheets is NOT an easy task. We have an<br/>\nold comforter under the bottom fitted sheet so you don&#39;t feel the plastic of<br/>\nthe waterbed plus it helps insulate the heat. In the summer we often sleep<br/>\non top of the top comforter (keeping the covers on keeps the heat in the<br/>\nbed) and use a light sheet (mainly I think because it&#39;s weird to sleep<br/>\nwithout a cover) or for some odd reason we have a 3rd comforter that is much<br/>\nthinner than the regular one and we might pull that one on if it gets chilly<br/>\nduring the night. <br/>\n <br/>\nSo one night after a very busy day we all slept soundly and Damon wet the<br/>\nbed quite thoroughly. He soaked all 3 comforters and a set of sheets plus<br/>\nhis jammies. Lots of laundry to do! I was totally sympathetic, but he was<br/>\nupset that he was covered in pee AND that he had wet the bed. <br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to put a fitted sheet onto a waterbed! Oh what a pain! I<br/>\ndiscovered long ago that we could use regular king sheets instead of the<br/>\nspecially made waterbed sheets that didn&#39;t stay down and are hard to find.<br/>\nAnyway, once they&#39;re on, we tend to leave them on for several weeks because<br/>\nit&#39;s such a pain to change them. <br/>\n <br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t so bad that we had to launder all those comforters, I figured they<br/>\nprobably needed it. But then it happened again a week later. This time only<br/>\nthe sheets and bottom comforter. Then again not even a week later and again<br/>\na few days after that. Not a lot at first, but then more and more. Hmmm....<br/>\nmaybe he is not ready to sleep without a pullup?!<br/>\n <br/>\nA few days ago I woke up because Damon was crying hysterically and running<br/>\naround the room. He was running back and forth tapping Geoff and me and<br/>\ncrying. I knew he had to pee, but wasn&#39;t sure why he was crying. It was only<br/>\na couple of hours after we had gone to bed, I had a hard time waking up. I<br/>\ncarried him to the potty but he would not sit on it. He kicked and screamed<br/>\nand squirmed out of my arms and sat on the floor right in front of it and<br/>\ncried. I tried to tell him that his body woke up because he had to pee, it<br/>\nwas a warning so he wouldn&#39;t wet the bed. But he was freaking out and I was<br/>\ntired. Now I&#39;m not even sure he was fully awake. I walked around to catch a<br/>\nbreath and think of what else I could do (brain not fully awake). When I<br/>\nwent back to Damon, he was sitting in a puddle of pee. I ran some water in<br/>\nthe tub until it was warm and then lifted him and set him in it, taking off<br/>\nhis wet pants. I got him and the floor cleaned up and dried and then I asked<br/>\nhim if he wanted to wear a pullup. We had 1 left. He said yes. It was dry<br/>\nwhen he woke up, so he wore it again the next night too. <br/>\n <br/>\nI am wondering if I do need to go buy some pullups and if it should become<br/>\npart of our nighttime routine again or if they should just be there in case<br/>\nhe thinks he needs one. I don&#39;t really think he knows when he might have an<br/>\naccident, so I&#39;m not sure the purpose then, say if he chooses not to wear<br/>\none and wets the bed. Then they aren&#39;t really helping. But if he wears one<br/>\nevery night, how will he ever know when he can stop wearing them again? I<br/>\nsuppose it just happens.<br/>\n <br/>\nI also want to add my husband asked last night why he was wearing a pullup<br/>\nto bed because he was a big boy now and using the potty. I said it was his<br/>\nchoice, but I&#39;d rather have him in a dry pullup than doing laundry every<br/>\nday. I&#39;m not sure how to talk to Geoff about this, but I&#39;m also not sure the<br/>\nbest course of action so Damon doesn&#39;t think anything is wrong with himself.<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nKim Zerbe<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":344161890,"authorName":"Zerena","from":"&quot;Zerena&quot; &lt;zerenahs@...&gt;","profile":"zerenac","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Potty trained in 1 week!","postDate":"1245688967","msgId":46006,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA0OWIwMWM5ZjM1OCQ3OWE1NTYwMCQ2Y2YwMDIwMCRAY2E+","inReplyToHeader":"PDc5NjYyMi43NTc4OC5xbUB3ZWI1ODEwNy5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDAzMTEwMWM5ZWZmOSRiZTNiZTAyMCQ2NDBhYTlhOUBHb256bz4gPDc5QTUxRTEzLUE1NTMtNEFGMC05NTIxLUYzMDczMTAxQjAyQkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDc5NjYyMi43NTc4OC5xbUB3ZWI1ODEwNy5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":45979,"nextInTopic":46011,"prevInTime":46005,"nextInTime":46007,"topicId":45964,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I was a bed wetter up into my early teens and beyond and was treated horribly by my mom s 2nd husband, I had to wear a towel to bed at night as a diaper and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-144290526\">I was a bed wetter up into my early teens and beyond and was treated<br/>\nhorribly by my mom&#39;s 2nd husband, I had to wear a towel to bed at night as a<br/>\ndiaper and was given a smack in the head and ridiculed for accidents. I<br/>\nremember being placed in a diaper and a crib at 5 by a babysitter because I<br/>\nhad a daytime accident. I was an extremely shy and self conscious child,<br/>\nwith low self esteem. I also remember taking little blue pills at night to<br/>\nhelp with my problem. My problem became easier as I got older because I was<br/>\nin charge of laundry and could hide the evidence before it was seen. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo we have always been very careful in how we deal with kids in our house in<br/>\nthis area as it did scar me. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy youngest is 11.5 and still has night time accidents. At 2.5 yrs old she<br/>\nwas potty trained and a BIG girl who refused to wear diapers, and it was a<br/>\nfight we were not interested in. Over the last 9 years, her accidents have<br/>\nbecome fewer and fewer, from nightly for 2 weeks to 2 or 3 in a row a month.<br/>\nWe have done all the tricks of watching what she eats/drinks and when and<br/>\nmaking sure she used the potty and even gotten her up in the night to no<br/>\navail. It happens when it happens with little or no explanation, stress or<br/>\nnight time crying can be causes but not consistent enough to be a for sure<br/>\ncause. We have never made an issue of it and it is expected that when she<br/>\nwakes she takes a bath, and strips her bed, which she has always done except<br/>\nfor one occasion, and I didn&#39;t realize until we were out in public. We did<br/>\nconsult our paediatrician and were offered the pad or alarm that went off if<br/>\nshe got wet, but for social situations that is embarrassing, and were given<br/>\nDDAVP for her. We call it the &quot;pee pill&quot;. She also suffers from mild anxiety<br/>\nso there are times when this pill is helpful. We use it only for when she is<br/>\nat camp (she is a Scout and a Guide) and sleepovers to give her a little<br/>\nextra help staying dry in what is often be a higher anxiety time, and higher<br/>\nchance of accidents. Bed wetting does not seem to cause any emotional issues<br/>\nfor her and most places she has sleepovers at completely understand. She<br/>\nknows that when she goes to camp that she doesn&#39;t drink hot chocolate before<br/>\nbed as she is guaranteed an accident if she does, she also knows to watch<br/>\nher fluid intake in the evening. She also takes an extra sleeping bag to<br/>\ncamp, and her camp councillors know and have been instructed on how to deal<br/>\nwith this as it affects her anxiety and everything else if dealt with<br/>\nharshly. Recently our family doctor reluctantly gave us a prescription for<br/>\nthe pill stating she didn&#39;t think it was needed anymore, our paediatrician<br/>\ndoes feel that with her anxiety it is very helpful if for nothing more to<br/>\ngive her peace of mind which is half the battle.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy older 2 kids occasional bed wetting events but never often, and usually<br/>\neasily explained (sick, over tired, high stress).<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe also know quite a few kids who were late bed wetter&#39;s. Most of them used<br/>\npull-ups but not all, and they always felt comfortable here.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nZerena<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>]<br/>\nOn Behalf Of Kathryn<br/>\nSent: June-20-09 12:52 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Potty trained in 1 week!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a little late with this.

There are other problems with using rewards and punishments, but they don&#39;t always apply equally in every situation. The biggest problem, imo, is undermining intrinsic motivation - taking initiative away from the child and leaving the child feeling powerless and manipulated. Sometimes, a little bribery might be just the thing to support a person in doing something they really want to do, though. In fact, if anybody wants to bribe ME by offering me some kind of little reward every time I exercise, I&#39;ll happily take it.&lt;G&gt;  Of course, I&#39;m talking about something we&#39;re doing collaboratively with a person who WANTS to do it - not talking about behaviorist methods of trying to shape behavior against someone&#39;s will.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, why not extend this to everything we want our kids to do? Because it can mess with intrinsic motivation.  If we pay a kid a dollar every time they read a book, for example, then we&#39;re telling them that reading, in and of itself, is not a valuable activity. But I paid Roxana to read to Rosie (Rosie was a later reader and my third child and Rosie wanted to be read to for hours every day. Rox was a great reader - did all the voices and sang the songs.) without worrying that it would mess up Roxana&#39;s long-run motivation to read out loud - I did it to get her to engage in more of a specific and short-term action and to show my appreciation that she&#39;d be willing to do more of it than she&#39;d have chosen for her own sake.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think rewarding for using a potty is a great idea, normally, because there is already a strong internal motivation to do it and most kids WILL do it when they physically can.<br/>\n<br/>\nRewarding is the same as punishing if the reward is withheld when the child fails. So if you set up a reward system for using the potty, to try to get the kid to use it, but the kid simply isn&#39;t physically or emotionally/developmentally ready for it, then you&#39;re punishing him for something out of his control. Mean.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, gently making using the potty more fun can be useful for those kids who ARE physically capable, and would like to be dry, but don&#39;t want to stop playing for even a few minutes to go to the bathroom.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m smiling because just writing this made me think about the bathrooms at Sandra&#39;s house - they are brimming with books and puzzles random little things and the backs of the doors are covered with comic strips and funny photos and little typed up stories and on and on....going to the bathroom there is so much fun that people tend to stay IN there much longer than normal.

(I feel like I<br/>\nwrote somewhere, now can&#39;t seem to find it!) <br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, just after Christmas or New Years (of this year) I had been getting<br/>\na bit anxious about the fact that my 4.5yr old was still in pullups and had<br/>\nabsolutely no desire to go to the potty on his own. I felt like I was doing<br/>\neverything I could to help him recognize when he had to pee and go to the<br/>\npotty. But every time I asked or suggested he go or if we were shopping ask<br/>\nhim to go just because I was going, well, every time resulted in him yelling<br/>\nat me or crying. <br/>\n <br/>\nHe would NOT sit on ANY potty if I asked. He would not seek one out on his<br/>\nown. He would not tell me if he had gone pee or poop in his pullup. He would<br/>\noften not let me change his poopy diapers without a full on fight, hitting<br/>\nme, kicking, yelling, spitting. <br/>\n <br/>\nDamon was a very busy child. Mostly busy with wii games, but played very<br/>\nintently with trains and cars and other things too. He would sit in a pee<br/>\nfilled diaper so long (and pee in it multiple times) it would leak out onto<br/>\nhis pants. I kept waiting for him to TELL ME that he had peed or pooped and<br/>\nneeded to be changed. Wouldn&#39;t that be at least a step in the right<br/>\ndirection? If he knew he had gone?! <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I saw his wet pants, I&#39;d change him right away, but felt like I had let<br/>\nit go too long. Sometimes I had to stand him in the tub to rinse off because<br/>\nthe poop was everywhere. He would just never tell me he had pooped. I could<br/>\ntell if I saw him go behind the couch, I knew what he was doing, but then<br/>\nI&#39;d have to wait until he was done, and even then he&#39;d tell me he wasn&#39;t<br/>\ndone and wouldn&#39;t let me near him. <br/>\n <br/>\nI was so frustrated with the way things were going! I did not push. I<br/>\nrefrained from shaming even though other people in his life (like my MIL and<br/>\noccasionally his own dad) resorted to telling him that only babies wear<br/>\ndiapers, he was a big boy and big boys peed in the potty, etc etc. Grandma<br/>\nalso gave him $1 every time he did pee on the potty and lo and behold he<br/>\nused the potty for her. That wasn&#39;t supposed to work! Why did it work for<br/>\nher?! (Maybe it didn&#39;t?! Maybe she was coercing him and paying him anyway.)<br/>\n <br/>\nI had doubts. I sort of envied other parents whose younger children used the<br/>\npotty. I hated that I had to keep buying pullups. I thought about not buying<br/>\nany more (some bad advice I was given) but the way things were going, he<br/>\nstill needed them for whatever reason. <br/>\n <br/>\nI tried to let go of my frustrations. When I found him in poop, I did not<br/>\nyell or get mad, I just picked him up and said it was time for a bath. He<br/>\nknew. I started asking him to help clean the poop out of his butt in the tub<br/>\nor shower and let him stay in as long as he wanted.<br/>\n <br/>\nBecause he sat in poop too much, he started getting a rash on his butt. At<br/>\nleast I think that&#39;s why he got it. I tried several kinds of creams and<br/>\nepsom salts in his bath but the rash stayed. He picked at it and there were<br/>\nopen scabs. I had to put bandaids on his butt.<br/>\n <br/>\nOne day I said I was sad that he still had the rash. I wished we could help<br/>\nmake his rash go away. I thought he could help by not wearing pullups around<br/>\nthe house during the day. It would be good to run around and air it out. He<br/>\ndid not want the rash anymore so he tried it. Without pullups, he went and<br/>\nsat on the potty. By himself. He still wanted to wear pullups at night, and<br/>\nsometimes asked for one in the afternoons so he could poop in it. (I did try<br/>\ntelling him he could poop on the potty but it was too soon for that!)<br/>\n <br/>\nDamon did really well for a few days. Then Grandma came to visit. She<br/>\nwatched Damon while I worked at an event for 4 days at the end of March. I<br/>\nwas home every evening. She took him out and kept him very busy. He wore<br/>\nunderwear. She was very dilligent about putting him on the potty every hour<br/>\nor so. (A common method some parents swear by.) He was very good at peeing<br/>\nin the potty when he had to (sometimes he didn&#39;t have to). At the end of 1<br/>\nweek, he was going to the potty on his own, whenever he needed to. OK, he<br/>\nwas still wearing pullups at night, but he didn&#39;t really need them. They<br/>\nwere always dry. One week. From pullups to underwear and no accidents.<br/>\n <br/>\nOne night he fell asleep in his clothes and I put him in bed. The next day<br/>\nwhen he woke I told him he had slept without a pullup and stayed dry! He was<br/>\nso excited! He stopped asking for pullups at night. <br/>\n <br/>\nThen one day I was down in the laundry room in the basement and heard him<br/>\ncalling for me. Mom! MOM! It sounded urgent so I rushed up but couldn&#39;t find<br/>\nhim. He was on the potty and needed to be wiped! OMG! He had pooped on the<br/>\npotty on his own! Hallelujah!!! Who knew it could happen?! I tried not to<br/>\nmake a big deal out of it, but it was pretty cool. He told his dad about it<br/>\nwhen he got home. <br/>\n <br/>\nEver since then he goes to the bathroom on his own, to pee or poop. There<br/>\nhave been several accidents. A couple of poops in the pants, and I just do<br/>\nwhat I did before, put him in the bathtub. Now he cleans himself up while I<br/>\nscrub the underwear. He has peed in the bed a couple of times, when he fell<br/>\nasleep early and we didn&#39;t make one last trip to the potty. I always mention<br/>\nthat he didn&#39;t get to empty his bladder before he fell asleep because he<br/>\ngets really upset when he wets the bed and cries. <br/>\n <br/>\nI wet the bed for many years and was yelled at a lot for something I could<br/>\nnot control. I remember stripping the sheets off my own bed and sleeping on<br/>\nthe floor because I didn&#39;t want to wake anyone up and get yelled at. I think<br/>\nI wanted to give Damon the benefit of the doubt in case he was like me. My<br/>\nhusband never yells at him for wetting the bed either. He even does the<br/>\nlaundry.<br/>\n <br/>\nI just wanted to share how it all worked out. Kids are amazing. I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink I posted my frustrations here, but now you get the whole story with a<br/>\nhappy ending. How it does pay off to wait it out, be compassionate, and find<br/>\na way to give your child what he needs. Maybe this will be an encouragement<br/>\nto anyone else in the same situation!<br/>\n <br/>\nKim Zerbe <br/>\nDamon will be 5 next week (and is no longer in pullups, hooray!)<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46005,"nextTopicId":46026}}
