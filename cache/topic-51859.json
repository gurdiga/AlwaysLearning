When I blow a bubble and seal it with my mouth, a little bit of spit gets caught inside.  If I continue to blow amazing bubbles and build on my original piece of gum, then each bubble is alive, beautiful and unique.  That is what I consider unschooling days to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I envision that bubble just sitting there with no further anything from me (cause you know, I know how to blow a bubble so why should I do anything more - being snarky with myself here), then the spit and air are just trapped on the inside. Since the bubble has been sealed with slowly dying air and originally good bacteria, then I imagine the spit would mold or become rancid somehow.  This is not what I consider great unschooling days.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe spit concept in my head is based on the lack of life or moldy life that can consume the bubble. The spit was originally alive!<br/>\n<br/>\nOr we could just say, &quot;Crystal in a plastic unschooling bubble without an air source.&quot; I&#39;m envisioning myself in the bedroom from the movie The Boy in the Plastic Bubble with John Travolta.  He was afraid to leave the safety of the bubble but he had an intense desire to live in the real world and be free.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~Glad to have your unafraid presence~~~<br/>\n<br/>\nNeo, I&#39;m not afraid anymore. <br/>\n<br/>\n~Crystal in New Mexico~</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] The Purpose of this list, lazy parenting, and small steps towards greatness","postDate":"1268184720","msgId":51861,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU1NDBEOTBBLTlGRTAtNEY2Ny1CQzg4LTIyOUU5OTA4QTEzNEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEQ4NTQxM0FBOEMwODQzRTJCNDVCNjNBQ0ZBN0Q0OUI3QFNvcnNjaGFzbW9tUEM+","referencesHeader":"PDEyNjgxMzgwMTIuMTg5LjEwNjcxLm00QHlhaG9vZ3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPEQ4NTQxM0FBOEMwODQzRTJCNDVCNjNBQ0ZBN0Q0OUI3QFNvcnNjaGFzbW9tUEM+"},"prevInTopic":51859,"nextInTopic":51864,"prevInTime":51860,"nextInTime":51862,"topicId":51859,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-We feel that we ve been in the unschooling bubble so long that we ve just kind of been floating (like spit) in the inside. -=- Uh... up to the spit part I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1075722646\">-=-We feel that we&#39;ve been in the unschooling bubble so long that<br/>\nwe&#39;ve just kind of been floating (like spit) in the inside. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nUh... up to the spit part I was right with ya. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly says some families live in &quot;unschooling world&quot; instead of the  <br/>\nreal world.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen some people care more about whether their other unschooling  <br/>\nfriends are impressed by this or that than they care about what their  <br/>\nkids like.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlad to have your unafraid presence, Crystal.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":201248820,"authorName":"Sorschasmom","from":"&quot;Sorschasmom&quot; &lt;willowsfortress@...&gt;","profile":"sorschasmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"The Purpose of this list, lazy parenting, and small steps towards greatness","postDate":"1268180900","msgId":51859,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQ4NTQxM0FBOEMwODQzRTJCNDVCNjNBQ0ZBN0Q0OUI3QFNvcnNjaGFzbW9tUEM+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEyNjgxMzgwMTIuMTg5LjEwNjcxLm00QHlhaG9vZ3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDEyNjgxMzgwMTIuMTg5LjEwNjcxLm00QHlhaG9vZ3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":51861,"prevInTime":51858,"nextInTime":51860,"topicId":51859,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~The purpose of this list isn t to stumble as a group.

It&#39;s for people to <br/>\nsee where they want to be as to unschooling, and take direct small steps <br/>\ntoward that.~~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been on AlwaysLearning since 2000ish (with an immediate 2 ½ year <br/>\nabsence since the list scared the poop out of me in the beginning).  In the <br/>\n7 ½ years that I have been a faithful lurker, I have only posted about 6 or <br/>\n7 times.  I read, read and read.  I&#39;m continuing to grasp concepts, put them <br/>\nin my pretty basket, and then I read some more in the eventuality that my <br/>\nbasket will one day overflow with the knowledge I seek.   In the beginning, <br/>\nI &quot;stumbled&quot; onto this list but I am so grateful that the list writers keep <br/>\nme walking &quot;step by step&quot; in the direction of being a better Mother.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDave and I now have a 12-year-old daughter.  She has different needs and <br/>\ndesires then a decade ago.  For the past 4 months or so, we have been in the <br/>\nprocess of re-evaluating our past and current steps to being better parents. <br/>\nIt is a very deliberate and conscious act to make adjustments in our <br/>\nparenting.  We feel that we&#39;ve been in the unschooling bubble so long that <br/>\nwe&#39;ve just kind of been floating (like spit) in the inside.  We&#39;ve been <br/>\nadding to our delightful life, but we&#39;ve become complacent in things that we <br/>\nthought we had down.  We &quot;got it&quot;, then I think we might have lost some of <br/>\nit and there is definitely room to &quot;get more&quot; of it.  Our goal is to &quot;get&quot; <br/>\nall of it!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to recent discussions on this list, we decided to continue to gently <br/>\npop our bubble and reexamine if we have become &quot;lazy unschoolers&quot;.  We&#39;ve <br/>\nfound that in some ways we have and in other ways we haven&#39;t.  The <br/>\ninteresting aspect is realizing how far we have come and where we might be <br/>\nright now if we had not &quot;stumbled&quot; upon this list.  Having stepped out of <br/>\nour little bubble we realize we had forgotten that the world is much bigger <br/>\nthan parkdays & activities with a few select families.  We had forgotten <br/>\nthat we chose this lifestyle because we wanted our lives filled with <br/>\neverything and not just selected pieces because they were &quot;easy&quot; (or dare I <br/>\nuse the world lazy).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis past year, I had become reliant on get-togethers to fill our days.  I <br/>\nfound that it can become very &quot;easy&quot; to waist days away at social outlets <br/>\nwhen what my daughter really needed was simply me.  It became &quot;easy&quot; to use <br/>\nthose outlets as a mask for not Being with my kiddo.  Those outlets take up <br/>\ntime so I didn&#39;t have to (yes I used Have To) Do anything.  I tricked myself <br/>\ninto thinking that I was providing necessary stimulation when in actuality <br/>\nSorscha needed less stimulation and my mindful, peaceful presence.  Yes, I&#39;m <br/>\nembarrassed for my lack but I am absolutely empowered because I SEE my <br/>\nlaziness.  By being honest with myself, I am consciously back to the Mom I <br/>\nLOVE being.  I LIKE that!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDave and I now focus on not just being present (whether that&#39;s 20 yards from <br/>\nour kiddo at an activity) but Doing.   We&#39;re back to exploring new <br/>\nadventures instead of sitting in weekly routines.   It&#39;s exciting and so <br/>\nmany new passions have opened.  We had forgotten that &quot;this&quot; was what we <br/>\nstarted all of &quot;this&quot; for!  Talk about a serious parental reality check.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDave & I have been discussing the areas where we can improve and expand our <br/>\nparenting.  We&#39;ve gone back to Radical Unschooling Boot Camp 101 and we are <br/>\nrereading a mass of information.  We are really thinking about what we are <br/>\nreading - We&#39;re not skimming through topics because we had already &quot;gotten <br/>\nthat one&quot;.   We are reading, discussing, high five-ing, and sometimes <br/>\nwondering how we forgot &quot;that part&quot;.   It&#39;s a very COOL place to be as a <br/>\nfamily and Sorscha (now going by Fang) will benefit from our reexaminations <br/>\nas radical unschooling parents.  We look forward to the next decade on <br/>\nAlwaysLearning - which is an interesting thought because my kiddo will be 22 <br/>\nand Sandra&#39;s kiddos will be in their 30&#39;s (well, Holly will be 28).  Now <br/>\nTHAT makes me want to make sure I&#39;m &quot;getting it&quot; now!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, so I post hardly anything for a decade and now ya&#39;ll get a mass of <br/>\nparagraphs.  Be gentle with my grammatical errors.  I&#39;m not a writer but a <br/>\nRadical Unschooling Mama with something to write.  I know to the outside, <br/>\ntraditional parenting world that we are attentive, amazing, opportunity <br/>\ninspiring, imaginative parents, but to us, well, we want more because there <br/>\nIS way more.  Unfortunately though, there is little time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Crystal in New Mexico~</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":51757,"nextTopicId":51728}}
