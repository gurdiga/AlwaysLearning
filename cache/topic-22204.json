It was the old days and  they <br/>\nWANTED me to be creative and innovative, so that helped.   <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think when teachers envision how wonderful homeschooling would  be, <br/>\nthey still generally think it&#39;s &quot;more teaching&quot; and more individualized  <br/>\nteaching.  Teaching, teaching, teaching. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nIn the U.S.  it&#39;s always said that &quot;it&quot; (whatever their goals are  in that <br/>\nseason) would work better with smaller classes.  Unfortunately,  the tradition <br/>\nhas come to be maintaining large classes in the  government-funded schools.  So <br/>\nwhen enrollment is down, they lose some  teachers rather than spread the kids <br/>\nout thinner.   <br/>\n <br/>\nThere is a certain strata of the educational monstrosity here, I think,  that <br/>\nwould hate for it to work better, because they would lose their  <br/>\nadministrative grant-writing, money managing jobs.  LOTS of people  &quot;above&quot; teachers make <br/>\nquite a bit of money.  Teachers make very little,  and their dream is <br/>\nsometimes to do useful, satisfying work since they&#39;re  making so little money for it.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s a gigantic mess I usually try to avoid talking about.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf they changed funding methods, every homeschooler who left would  improve <br/>\nthe schools on the spot by freeing up time and space for the other  students.  <br/>\nThe cashflow &quot;loss&quot; to a school from losing a student is  artificial.  The <br/>\nmoney that goes to schools here comes from land taxes  (and various federal tax <br/>\nthings, but it should never have, and yet  does).  The flow in at the first <br/>\ngate doesn&#39;t change for fewer children,  but its distribution to individual <br/>\ndistricts and schools is tied to enrollment  and attendance.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMaybe someone who&#39;s politically inclined here (or some in each state,  <br/>\nprovince, county, everywhere that it might matter) should point that out to  <br/>\nfinancial officials and suggest they just change the way they fund  schools.  Me, I&#39;m <br/>\njust passing the idea on to those with more energy, and  I&#39;m going to have <br/>\nsome tea and work on my webpage.  Lazy me.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd about webpages, and England, and school:  Holly&#39;s exciting  European <br/>\nvacation is halfway over today, and I have a story about a story  involving little <br/>\nfish they played with in holes on Omaha Beach in  Normandy.  I expect more <br/>\nphotos later today, but if you&#39;ve missed the one  of her all muddy, it&#39;s there:<br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/england_\">http://sandradodd.com/england_</a> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/england)\">http://sandradodd.com/england)</a> <br/>\nWhen I saw the mudfight in the Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream (which has SAM  <br/>\nROCKWELL, along with Kevin Klein, Rupert Evert, and some mud-covered women), I  <br/>\nthought it must be movie-mud of some sort, prop mud, make-up mud.   <br/>\nChocolate-syrup-for-mud.  Nope.  It&#39;s English mud, apparently.   (And if a bunch of you <br/>\neast-coast American types think it&#39;s &quot;normal mud,&quot; you  ain&#39;t seen mud in New <br/>\nMexico and west Texas, which is a bit more like wet  cement with too much sand,  <br/>\nthan like liquid color.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22184,"nextTopicId":22207}}
