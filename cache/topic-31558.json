But a recheck shows that it has at last been toppled  <br/>\n&gt; from this position. The longest entry in the revised matter is  <br/>\n&gt; represented by the verb to make (published in June 2000). However,  <br/>\n&gt; it is quite possible that set will regain its long-held position at  <br/>\n&gt; the top of the league of long words when it comes itself to be  <br/>\n&gt; revised.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In ranking order, the longest entries currently in the online Third  <br/>\n&gt; Edition of the OED are: make (verb - revised), set (verb), run  <br/>\n&gt; (verb), take (verb), go (verb), pre- (revised), non- (revised),  <br/>\n&gt; over- (revised), stand (verb), red, and then point (the noun -  <br/>\n&gt; revised).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Joyce</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31557,"nextTopicId":31544}}
