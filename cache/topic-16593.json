But it does not give you a high quality casting! If you want a professional grade casting, visit life casting (online) and check out their kits and truly professional grade materials. Once you get the idea of how it&#39;s done, you may want to check out the casting materials (probably under sculpting) at Dick Blick art supplies. <br/>\nA really good casting shows every little detail, the belly button and everything look perfect. Plus it is made of a material that is of archival quality and will last forever.<br/>\nBut if that isn&#39;t your goal and you just want something cheap and easy, do the plaster bandaging yourself. Just use vaseline smeared over your belly first. If you really build it up thick enough, you could even use the mold to pour some material into for a more detailed cast of your belly.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are the links:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dickblick.com/\">http://www.dickblick.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.artmolds.com/\">http://www.artmolds.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nUsing a small kit at lifecasting (artmolds) you can get some really beautiful hand casts. Be sure to check out their pictures of complete body castings...very cool!  This is an area of art I want to explore in depth.

She would probably appreciate having another person to help -- I have known people who did their own entirely, but it would seem pretty awkward to me.  A friend did mine. <br/>\n<br/>\nGet the plaster strips at a crafts supply store (I&#39;ve been told you can also get them at a medical supply store) and if she wants some plaster to smooth it down, get it at a Home Depot kind of place.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-Cat  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dnowens@...\">Dnowens@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, October 09, 2003 2:11 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Pregnant belly casts<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Did anyone ever make a belly cast when they were pregnant?
