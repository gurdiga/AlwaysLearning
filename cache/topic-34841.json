One day, she had a meltdown when it was time to go home.  I  <br/>\ntold her that, if we couldn&#39;t leave the park, we couldn&#39;t go to the  <br/>\npark.  The next day, when she thought we should go, I reminded her  <br/>\nthat we would need to be able to leave and come home; could she do  <br/>\nthat?  She said she could, and I, as usual, gave her fair warning when  <br/>\nthe time to go approached.  She stuck to her word.  I think I had to  <br/>\nmake the same statement one more time a few days later.  I never did  <br/>\nhave to punitively tell her we couldn&#39;t go because she&#39;d melted down  <br/>\nthe last time; I just calmly reminded her of the simple fact that we  <br/>\nwould have to leave the park to come home eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, the ds was another story... &lt;g&gt;  He decided once that it was  <br/>\nfunny to not get in the car to leave our homeschool park day; he had  <br/>\nhis schooled (and very strictly parented!) friend with him, too.  He  <br/>\nstayed up on the top of the swingset instead of coming with us.  I  <br/>\nloaded everyone in the car, started the engine and backed out of the  <br/>\nspace.  He scrambled down in a hurry.  Mind you, he must have been 12  <br/>\nat the time!  His friend was horrified by his behavior.  I just told  <br/>\nhim the same thing: if we can&#39;t leave the park, we can&#39;t go to the  <br/>\npark...<br/>\n<br/>\nI must have learned from my mom...  She had a technique for getting  <br/>\nrowdy kids to settle down in the car.  She&#39;d pull over and stop, turn  <br/>\noff the engine, get out her book or her knitting, and wait.  This  <br/>\nworked best when we were going somewhere *we* wanted to be, often with  <br/>\nfriends along, like the beach.
