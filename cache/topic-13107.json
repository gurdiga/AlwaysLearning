It sounds like you like  it there. <br/>\n Are there eductional requirements you must meet like here in NY?<br/>\nMy girls are very, very maternal with the baby.  Sometimes I feel bad <br/>\nbecause my older sister has a 2 yr old girl (as do I) and a 7 month old <br/>\nboy.  Her daughter is very aggressive toward her brother and my sister <br/>\nis always asking me if any of my girls were like that.  I have to say <br/>\nno, but I feel bad that she makes the comparison.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s because we and our households are so opposite.  Our house: <br/>\nI stay at home, home births, co-sleeping, unschooling, no schedule at <br/>\nall except for a loose bedtime for the girls, meals whenever and <br/>\nwherever, lots of playtime but strict rules of courtesy, respect and <br/>\nmanners.  Her house: both parents work full time, hospital births, in <br/>\ncribs to maintain strict sleeping schedules, structured daycare with <br/>\nonly same-age children, very strict meal/snack schedules, limited <br/>\nplayspace due to a house in constant construction.<br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, I feel sad for her and her kids.  They are all always sick and <br/>\nso tense.  I just don&#39;t understand how in a world like today&#39;s with its <br/>\nviruses, wars, etc. anyone would choose to live a life so focused on <br/>\nmaterialism.  It all comes down to that, I think, because if it weren&#39;t <br/>\nso important to my sister to keep such an expensive house, clothes, and <br/>\nother things, she could stay at home and least show her kids that they <br/>\nare the most important thing really.  She wouldn&#39;t even have to go as <br/>\nfar as I do (home births, unschooling).  If only she could just be there <br/>\nfor them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the best part of our lives is that every day is like a holiday. <br/>\n And we really truly are enjoying every day.  My older girls go to bed <br/>\nsaying &quot;this was the best day we&#39;ve ever had.&quot;  And like I said, with <br/>\nthe instability of our world, shouldn&#39;t we all try to make each day the <br/>\nbest day we&#39;ve ever had, if for no other reason because we had the good <br/>\nfortune to be blessed with the oppotunity just to have another day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMay you all have your best day ever!

I just had my 4th son (3months ago) and<br/>\nit&#39;s lovely having four no matter if they are boys or girls. I like having<br/>\nmy tribe of boys and thinks it&#39;s really neat. What ticks me off the most is<br/>\nwhen people say &quot;oh don&#39;t you wish you had a girl,&quot; or &quot;are you trying for<br/>\na girl?&quot; Well a girl would be great but the boys I have are just fine thank<br/>\nyou very much. <br/>\nAnd actually living in the Middle East is good because lots of boys is<br/>\nhighly respected:) People always congratulate my husband!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&quot;  So according to everyone, upon becoming young women, my<br/>\n&gt; beautiful, sweet, intelligent babies are going to become fighting<br/>\n&gt; machines with no sense or feeling outside of making my life miserable.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We get that as well. I think people think boys will just run wild. Mine are<br/>\nlovely (most of the time:) And the 2 oldest, at 15 and 13, are a joy to be<br/>\naround. We laugh a lot, talk about everything and really enjoy each others<br/>\ncompany. If we do have issues then we talk about them and find ways to work<br/>\nthru things. We don&#39;t shout very ofte (I whine or snap when I&#39;m grouchy or<br/>\nticked off at things but I&#39;m trying to stop:) and the kids sometimes snap<br/>\nat us but they don&#39;t yell or slam doors etc. I guess because they don&#39;t<br/>\nhave reason to as any anger is short lived and easily worked thru.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do find that when we go thru periods of time in which one or more of the<br/>\nkids is away from home a lot then they tend to fight more. It also happens<br/>\nwhen we have other kids over A LOT and it isn&#39;t just our family. When we<br/>\nget lots of chances to just hang out with the six of us then everything<br/>\nruns smoother.

The last meltdown she had<br/>\nwas after sleeping over (and probably not sleeping much) at a friend&#39;s<br/>\nhouse and eating nothing but a bowl of cereal in the morning and popcorn<br/>\nin the afternoon (and she&#39;s in the middle of a growth spurt), and then<br/>\ntearing her brand new jeans on a bike on the way home, at 7 or so... so<br/>\nthat was sort of understandable, although I didn&#39;t feel so understanding<br/>\nwhen we were standing in front of her friend&#39;s quite suburban house and<br/>\nshe was screaming at me that she wanted to be driven to the Gap corporate<br/>\nheadquarters *right then* so she could insist that they give her a<br/>\nreplacement pair of jeans, and then she punched me when I was not upset<br/>\nenough about the ripped jeans.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that&#39;s the first meltdown like that in a year or so, and when she was<br/>\n5 and 6 it was more like twice a week, so it&#39;s okay. And after we had a<br/>\npumpkin smash with a protein boost at Jamba Juice, Rain calmed down and<br/>\ndecided the jeans could be cut-offs, since it was getting warmer outside.<br/>\nAnd I asked her what she had eaten that day and left it at that, because<br/>\nmy pushing the protein thing had been an issue in the past... this time I<br/>\njust ordered the pumpkin smash and stuck it in her cup holder...and she<br/>\napologized to me, which is nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know about this new friend - Rain only met her a couple of weeks<br/>\nago and I only met the family this week. She seemed happy and bubbly and<br/>\nthe family interactions were pleasant and supportive. I don&#39;t know how<br/>\nlong they&#39;ve homeschooled - they did mention school. So perhaps the 3<br/>\nhours was some theatrical hyperbole, or perhaps this was a one-time thing<br/>\n- Rain still tells people about the time I got really mad when she was 5<br/>\nand threw a half-dozen apples against a wall - or perhaps her parents are<br/>\ntransitioning from one kind of living to another.  They did go to the HSC<br/>\nconference last year, or at least they had last year&#39;s bag (I have the<br/>\nbag too but didn&#39;t go to the conference, so perhaps one shouldn&#39;t jump to<br/>\nconclusions).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How&#39;s Rain&#39;s arm, by the way?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Fully functional but noticeably crooked, she goes back to the orthopedic<br/>\nguy in 3 months and he&#39;ll be able to tell then if it&#39;s going to<br/>\nstraighten on it&#39;s own. How&#39;s your leg?<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and while I&#39;m babbling on, we got a new dog, and I don&#39;t think I<br/>\ntalked about him here. :) We dogsat for a friend&#39;s black lab about 6<br/>\nweeks ago - we&#39;ve been his regular replacement people for years - and<br/>\nafter one evening of being clingy and nervous Nana really seemed to enjoy<br/>\nhis company. They had great walks together, sniffing stuff, and she<br/>\nseemed to take her cues from him a lot, on when to lie down and when to<br/>\ngo out and stuff. She seemed more comfortable... and we actually went to<br/>\nvisit them in Alameda last weekend and she went right up to him, sat in<br/>\nfront of him, and wagged her tail, which is just not typical Nana<br/>\nbehavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, we started poking around online and found a chocolate lab (Rain&#39;s<br/>\nDream Breed) marked Urgent, and acquired Keith. He&#39;s an old dog, at least<br/>\n10, who was found as a stray in Redding  and then spent a year in some<br/>\nsort of shelter where he was basically locked up in a cement cage and<br/>\nignored, until recently the shelter was closed down and he was rescued.<br/>\nHe chewed all the fur from his tail out of boredom while he was there,<br/>\nand his coat is dull and his teeth are bad, but he&#39;s still a sweet dog,<br/>\nvery snuggly, and we&#39;re getting him back on track. Nana doesn&#39;t like him<br/>\nquite as much as Mack - he tends to get possessive of us and growls when<br/>\nwe pet her, so we&#39;re trying to make sure he gets treats or petting<br/>\nwhenever we pet her, to create some positive links - but they have great<br/>\nfun on walks together, it&#39;s spring on the farm and they sniff all the<br/>\nsame things and run shoulder to shoulder. And Nana seems to follow his<br/>\nleadon stuff, too - she used to wait until the lights were out at night<br/>\nto eat dinner, but since Keith arrived she starts eating as soon as he<br/>\ndoes, which for him (being a lab) is right about when the bowl hits the<br/>\nfloor.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, that&#39;s what we&#39;re up to, more or less...<br/>\n<br/>\nDar</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":106031689,"authorName":"Jon and Rue Kream","from":"&quot;Jon and Rue Kream&quot; &lt;skreams@...&gt;","profile":"jonkream","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Re: responding to anti-child humor","postDate":"1048956701","msgId":13130,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PCF+IVVFTkVSa1ZDTURrQUFRQUNBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUJnQUFBQUFBQUFBb3RjOXlYdVBJRXV3MzdFd2ZJRzhMTUtBQUFBUUFBQUEyd2J2Z25rM3JVcWd5SVc5SW45cmZRRUFBQUFBQGF0dGJpLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":""},"prevInTopic":13129,"nextInTopic":13132,"prevInTime":13129,"nextInTime":13131,"topicId":13107,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I do know how to spell hundredth, really :0).

My name is Crystal.  I have been lurking here for a few months now<br/>\nbecause I think that at this point in my unschooling I need to listen more<br/>\nthan I speak.  I wanted to give my thoughts on this subject, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just got the joke in my email yesterday from my sister about the child who<br/>\nlearned in school that he had rights.  I remembered the updated one that I<br/>\nsaw here so I sent that one back with a polite little note saying that I<br/>\nthought it was disrespectful and I liked the new one better.  I also sent<br/>\nthe new version to everyone on her email list along with the note I wrote on<br/>\nhow I thought it was disrespectful to kids.  She wrote back screaming to me<br/>\nin her email about &quot;how dare any kid threaten their parent with calling CPS&quot;<br/>\nand that if you didn&#39;t take control your kids will end up pregnant or in<br/>\njail.  She titled it, &quot;Don&#39;t Mess with Mom&quot;.  I haven&#39;t responded to that<br/>\nbut so many people feel that way.  I think that most people don&#39;t look at<br/>\nthe real message being sent.  It&#39;s a joke, they laugh, they pass it on.<br/>\nThis is not a joke, though.  It is a message to kids that &quot;I am the parent,<br/>\nI am stronger&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t send all the jokes I get to everyone on my email list.  I don&#39;t send<br/>\nsexual jokes to anyone under 25.  I don&#39;t send male bashing jokes to my sons<br/>\nor brothers unless I want to direct it at them, so I think that when people<br/>\nsend these disrespectful jokes to parents it&#39;s because they don&#39;t believe<br/>\nthere is anything wrong with being disrespectful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw the same type of message in a commercial on TV today being tooted as<br/>\ngood parenting.  It was telling parents to snoop into their teenager&#39;s<br/>\nthings to keep them from doing drugs.  It said something to the effects that<br/>\nyour kids would be mad at you and may even hate you, but they would thank<br/>\nyou later and that if you love them, you will do it.  If TV is telling you<br/>\nthat you have to disrespect your children, then how can any good parent go<br/>\nagainst that?<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t been unschooling long enough to say &quot;look at how my kids turned<br/>\nout&quot;, but my thoughts to this is that if your kids feel like you are<br/>\npartners in their life, then they won&#39;t treat you like you are an adversary.<br/>\nYou will have no need to snoop and they will have no need to call CPS.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nsaid this to people before and I&#39;ve gotten responses like, &quot;you have to be<br/>\nthe parent, not their friend&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, just my thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrystal</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":89346128,"authorName":"Angie","from":"&quot;Angie&quot; &lt;angiehewerdine@...&gt;","profile":"zenrubyangel","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: responding to anti-child humor","postDate":"1048865424","msgId":13111,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI2MXBxZyttbHMyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDBIQ0YwMElLVU5FSk45QG10YTUuc25mYzIxLnBiaS5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":13110,"nextInTopic":13118,"prevInTime":13110,"nextInTime":13112,"topicId":13107,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yikes!

She adopted three Russian sisters, just a few years ago, and is <br/>\nvery strict with them, and used to write me complaining about how they <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t work hard at school, or just liked boys, or whatever.   She&#39;s a <br/>\ntheatre teacher, which I think is cool, but I&#39;ve always known she was very <br/>\ninto disciplinarian attitudes.   So she includes me on this long copylist, <br/>\ntwo of the jokes are offensive to me and harmful to children (in my opinion) <br/>\nso I responded to the list.  Here are the first exchanges.

They think we&#39;re all monsters who are incapable of moderating <br/>\nourselves where disciplining children is concerned.  Our children are growing <br/>\nup without a sense of proportion or respect for authority.  If more adults <br/>\nkept their perspective, stopped reading more into situations than exists, and <br/>\nallowed parents to raise their own children as they saw fit, we&#39;d have a lot <br/>\nmore happy children.  Humor is one way we deal with life and our place in it, <br/>\nwith sometimes strange or uncomfortable situations.  If more people retained <br/>\ntheir sense of humor, then we&#39;d have a lot fewer lawyers, a lot fewer <br/>\nparanoid people, and a lot more joy in life.<br/>\n    I don&#39;t have children, I have dogs, but I can tell you my dogs are very <br/>\nhappy when they know who is boss, what their limits are, when they are doing <br/>\nthings well and when they are in trouble (and exactly what they did to get in <br/>\ntrouble), and what is expected of them when living in my home.  I think our <br/>\nchildren would benefit from many of the same rules for living, but so many <br/>\nparents and teachers are afraid to place reasonable limits and consequences <br/>\non kids because of the overreactions of well-meaning people who took their <br/>\nmeddling too far.<br/>\n    Yes, there are people who are monsters and go too far, yes there are <br/>\npeople who deserve to be sued or lose their kids because they are bad people. <br/>\n But to treat everyone as if they are that kind of, very much in the <br/>\nminority, person is really very sad.

I&#39;m happy these means work for you.  I&#39;m sure they work for <br/>\nmany, much better than ruling by fear or pain.  However, I don&#39;t think <br/>\ndisciplining children with contraint constitutes ruling by fear or pain, but <br/>\nrather shows consequences to actions that the child understands very clearly. <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI just don&#39;t think that &quot;one size fits all&quot; where raising kids are concerned, <br/>\nnor do I think social services/govt. bureacracies should be telling everyone <br/>\nhow to do it.  I also don&#39;t think calling people abusive for spanking or ins<br/>\nisting on limits to be fair.  I see our society as having taken a few steps <br/>\nway too far toward regulating parents to the point that child rearing is <br/>\nbecoming disfunctional in the opposite direction, just because we are trying <br/>\nto stop a few people who shouldn&#39;t be parents in the first place.  Most of <br/>\nthe parents I know never need to spank their children, rarely need to yell at <br/>\nthem, are perfectly capable of placing limits and rules and pointing out what <br/>\nis not acceptable without raising their voices, but also understand that <br/>\nthere must be consequences to stepping outside the boundaries, and those <br/>\nconsequences must be something the child understands and wants to avoid in <br/>\nthe future or else they don&#39;t work.  To the opposite, I know parents whose <br/>\nchildren are out of control, who have to go to pretty far extremes to manage <br/>\ntheir children because they tried to use consequences that the child either <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t respect or believe, or purely doesn&#39;t comprehend as a child, to the <br/>\npoint where their children do not know how to interpret when they&#39;ve gone too <br/>\nfar.  I&#39;m not trying to change your beliefs with all of this, it just hit a <br/>\nchord.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t get your correlation between rapists, rape jokes, and the humor you <br/>\npointed out as bad.  You saw that humor as containing abusive behavior in it, <br/>\nwhile I did not.  Yes, there are jokes that go too far and I&#39;m very glad they <br/>\nare discouraged.  I just didn&#39;t happen to think those qualified since they <br/>\nwere poking fun at some very normal and functional behaviors (in mine, not <br/>\nyour, opinion).<br/>\n******************************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n******<br/>\nI didn&#39;t respond to that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis one below came without any other comment, and I don&#39;t know what &quot;it&quot; was <br/>\nor who the writer was.<br/>\n*********************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nyou did it again   :-)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7278,"nextTopicId":13197}}
