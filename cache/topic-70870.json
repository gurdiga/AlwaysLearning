What&#39;s so important about sitting at the table?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy partner and I eat meals together - dinner, most nights, and breakfasts when we can. The kids are welcome, and when Ray was still living with us he usually joined us because he likes the social aspect of eating together. Nowadays he often comes over and has lunch with George while I&#39;m at work. My daughter sometimes joins whoever is eating to socialize, or will come and eat with us but eat something different than what we&#39;re having. If she doesn&#39;t like the look of what we&#39;re eating - if the way it looks grosses her out, I mean - she may decide not to join us, or she may ask that we put up some kind of barrier (like a cereal box or open hardback book) so she doesn&#39;t have to see our food.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;She has a limited diet of foods she will eat and most of it is very unhealthy.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter has a very small apetite and very conservative tastes as well. When she was 4, she went a whole summer on milk almost exclusively (not breastmilk, grocery store cow&#39;s milk, nothing special). She did eat some home-made cookies, but something like three cookies a week. I got her some nice kid-vitamins, mostly to assuage my own sense of panic, and she liked those. She has always been robustly healthy of the &quot;how do you keep up with her?&quot; sort, which also helps. It&#39;s hard to worry too much about someone who can wear you out ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re worried about the quality of the food your daughter is eating, look for alternatives you can feel good about. Make as much of your own as you can so you can feel good about the ingredients. Buy varieties of commercial food that have better ingredients - one of the advantages of a kid who doesn&#39;t eat much is you can afford those fancy foods a lot more easily than one who eats as much as a rugby team ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nBe sure to &quot;count&quot; beverages as food, too. If she drinks juice, you can check the mental box next to &quot;fruits and vegetables&quot;. Does she like smoothies? My daughter mostly doesn&#39;t, but some kids adore them and that&#39;s a way to offer a whole lot of variety simply. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I always feel embarrassed if we go somewhere and we are expected to sit down to eat because I know she won&#39;t comply<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*************<br/>\n<br/>\nI try to make sure Mo eats before we go anywhere there will be food - if nothing else a snack in the car. Then I can say &quot;she just ate&quot; with perfect honestly and avoid hurt feelings. I also learned to bring things for my kids to do at the table if I wanted them to sit around while adults made boring conversation ;) Make &quot;the table&quot; a pleasant place to be, not a chore! Eating before the meal is also a good set up if a kid wants dessert first - &quot;it&#39;s okay, she just ate!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is this normal for kids to avoid mealtimes so insistently?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s normal for many people to avoid situations where they&#39;re going to be bored and/or frustrated.

Is there something I can be doing to help her?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My youngest daughter was a lot like this, and still is to some extent.   I had previously been quite controlling about meals and food.   My older daughter likes to sit and eat with someone else at the table, and she likes varied meals.  My younger has a much more limited palate at the moment, and doesn&#39;t like to try new things.   I used to be stressed about whether she was getting all the nutrition she needed.   Mealtimes became stressful, even when I tried hard to let go, and not let my stress show.   It *always* shows, in my experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe didn&#39;t do anything that most families would consider untoward.  But we definitely tried to pressure her into conforming to our ideas of what, how and when children should eat.   I realised change was desperately needed when my younger daughter did as you describe: ran screaming from the table the instant I put food on it, even when it was food she liked.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it was probably the food issues that brought me to radical unschooling.   I am very grateful that my daughter brought me here!   She realised I was being controlling, when I hadn&#39;t seen it.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI now - within reason - cook what she wants, when she wants, and she can eat it where she wants.   We have come to some agreements about some parameters for this.   For example, If she wants to eat at her computer she knows not to choose something sloppy or sticky.   She asks for simple things when I&#39;m cooking a big meal for everyone else.   If I&#39;ve made a main meal and she doesn&#39;t want it, then she&#39;ll happily wait until I&#39;ve eaten before asking me to heat up something simple for her.   I make a roast dinner most Sundays because everyone else in the family loves it.   My younger daughter knows that she can either join us, or request something else that&#39;s &#39;easy&#39; to make instead, which she can either eat with us, or take elsewhere.   She probably now chooses to eat with us about 50% of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have filling and nutritious &#39;snacks&#39; that she loves easily to hand where she can get them herself: hard boiled eggs, cheese, yoghurts, oatcakes, crackers, fruit.   There&#39;s also biscuits, sweets, cake.  Some days she&#39;ll go for the sweet stuff, other days the savoury.   Usually a mix of both, and - these days - what she&#39;s choosing start to look like a &#39;normal&#39; balanced meal once you tot it all up.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes she needs to see the rest of us eating something many times before she asks to try it.  I don&#39;t usually suggest new things for her to try because she will automatically refuse - sadly I mucked that up with my earlier controlling ways.  I hope that - one day - we can communicate about food without it being emotive.  I can wait.   It&#39;s getting better all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome dishes that she loves and requests most often I have found ways to make more nutritious.  For example she loves plain rice, so now I cook it in homemade chicken broth instead of water, and she likes it even more that way.  I also cook noodles in chicken broth.   Once I would have suggested she eat a side serving of vegetables and meat with the noodles.   Now I don&#39;t worry at all, because the nutrients from the vegetables and meat are there in the broth.   Doing things like this helps *me* relax about what she&#39;s eating, and that helps it be a non issue between us, because I&#39;m not silently worrying.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWe go to a particular buffet restaurant fairly regularly � when we&#39;re in the area and we can afford it.   That&#39;s where she is most experimental with trying new things.   There is no guilt attached, Mummy hasn&#39;t put any effort into cooking it, it&#39;s a &#39;eat all you can&#39; type place, so she can take bits of anything she likes the look of and discard it if she doesn&#39;t like it.  She can go up for more of anything she likes.  Some things from that restaurant we have later managed to supply or replicate at home to extend her options.  That&#39;s how she got to know that she loves calamari, fried fish, pork dumplings and lychees.    I think she likes it that we go to the same place, because it&#39;s familiar, she knows the layout and she knows what to expect.   And she knows there will be *something* there that she likes.  The first few times we went she ate only plain rice, fruit salad and ice cream.   But she was happy with that.  Delighted, in fact.<br/>\n<br/>\nI make monkey platters most evenings, which both girls eat while watching a movie, or something on their computer, or playing a game.   My daughter rarely eats cooked vegetables, but there&#39;s a surprising number of veggies she likes raw, when they&#39;re presented prettily, on a plate.   I use little &#39;bento&#39; cutters to make cute shapes out of things, she loves that.   I&#39;ve noticed that she is O.K about having the odd new thing put on a monkey platter, perhaps because I&#39;m never present when she tries it, perhaps because it&#39;s in a cute shape or part of a cute design.   She discovered she likes radishes and  &#39;petit pois&#39; that way (not sure what they are called in the U.S - but peas eaten in their pods).   So that means she&#39;s eating fresh veg most days � again, it helps me not to worry.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t go to many friend&#39;s houses for meals, because there is so much food-related pressure out there waiting to happen.  We live in France, at the moment, where meals can be quite formal and elaborate three course affairs when you&#39;re least expecting it!     There&#39;s a couple of families who know us really well, and they are happy for us to take a tin of baked beans or something that can easily be heated up, if my daughter doesn&#39;t like the look of anything else on offer.    With my family there is a history there from my own childhood of  &#39;eating what&#39;s on your plate&#39; etc.    I do the groundwork first to make sure there is no uncomfortable scene at the table.  It&#39;s been really challenging, but ultimately very healing for me to put my foot down and tell my parents that my daughter can decline to eat at all if she wants to.   My daughter and I have agreed in advance that she would prefer me to do the declining for her, if she tells me quietly whether she wants to eat or not.   That helps avoid a scene too.<br/>\n<br/>\nLucy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":359707411,"authorName":"dezignarob","from":"&quot;dezignarob&quot; &lt;dezignarob@...&gt;","profile":"dezignarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: 4 year old refuses to eat","postDate":"1362954673","msgId":70875,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtoajFqaCt0ajJsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGtoaWw5YytyNzNpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":70873,"nextInTopic":70876,"prevInTime":70874,"nextInTime":70876,"topicId":70870,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"=== I thought if I just let it be eventually she would join us. .....

So yes there have been times I have tried to press her to at least have a bite of something. No to trying everything, the utensils and the staying at the table though. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Could you name all the foods she will eat?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Shredded cheese, bits of hot dog, bacon, the coating off of chicken nuggets, chips, peanut butter, dry cereals, oranges, apples, and blueberries she will eat in very small amounts.  Mainly she eats popcorn and drinks chocolate milk. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] 4 year old refuses to eat","postDate":"1362947575","msgId":70872,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZGOTVGQzZELTA2NjYtNDQ0Qy1BNzYyLUQxMkQzRkFCNTFCM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGtoaWw5YytyNzNpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtoaWw5YytyNzNpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":70870,"nextInTopic":70873,"prevInTime":70871,"nextInTime":70873,"topicId":70870,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Is this normal for kids to avoid mealtimes so insistently?-=- You didn t mention breakfast or lunch.

Do her eyes look healthy?  Does &quot;eliminate&quot; okay?  Does she have enough strength to play?   <br/>\n<br/>\nCould you name all the foods she will eat?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd maybe look through some of this before you write back.   You don&#39;t need to respond at all, but if you do want to, a list of what she will eat might be helpful.
