Usually they<br/>\nwould pair up a relatively gentle and laid-back family<br/>\nwith an extremely neurotic, fanatic, control-freakish<br/>\none. My DS Brian (11) and I were intending to watch<br/>\nthe episode with the crazy screaming woman, but when<br/>\nthe last trailerwas playing just before the actual<br/>\nepisode came on, Brian said &quot;I don&#39;t think I want to<br/>\nwatch this after all, it looks like it&#39;s going to be<br/>\ntoo violent.&quot; So we changed channels and didn&#39;t watch<br/>\nit. It was a great illustration of the difference<br/>\nbetween fantasy violence and reality violence.<br/>\n<br/>\nNicole<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
