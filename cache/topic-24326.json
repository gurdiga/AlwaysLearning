I unschool my beautiful 6 year old son, Lewi.<br/>\n<br/>\n I feel a little (well, ALOT!) in awe here at the moment as I&#39;ve been reading some of your emails. All the famous unschooling folk are here! What a privilege to chat with you and hear how down-to-earth you all are. Sandra - you have been a huge inspiration to me and were the first point of call as I stepped onto the unschooling path. Your articles are absolutely wonderful and I&#39;ve gained so very much from the experiences you&#39;ve shared with your children. Pam - another one whom I love and feel totally inspired by. I know there are others (not sure if Rue is here but am reading her book as we speak - it&#39;s fantastic!). Sorry to do the big &quot;WOW&quot; thing but had to get it all off my chest so I&#39;ll try not to do it too much in the future!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am in huge deschool mode myself as a former primary school teacher. It&#39;s amazing how the icky things of the school system come out when I&#39;m least expecting them. Slowly but surely I&#39;m growing and changing and my desire to teach has pretty much evaporated (thankfully for Lewi) - unless of course he requests me to do so (very rare).<br/>\n<br/>\nThankfully Lewi has never been to school. I fell across unschooling when he was about 4 and we&#39;ve never looked back. I felt pretty alone at first as none of my friends or family &#39;got&#39; it but since then we&#39;ve formed a lovely local homeschooling group - some of whom are unschoolers. Recently a couple of friends have decided to unschool. It&#39;s so lovely having some wonderful and like-minded people around. There&#39;s certainly nothing like support.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m sorry for rambling on. I look forward to chatting with you all in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nKind Wishes<br/>\nKim<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24307,"nextTopicId":24310}}
