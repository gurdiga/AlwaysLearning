Who hires <br/>\nQuigley to wipe out the local Aboriginal population. Not a great film! There <br/>\nare so many inconsistencies... it is set in the Australian Outback, but wait, <br/>\nI don&#39;t think that is the real Outback, more like someone&#39;s, who has never <br/>\nheard of the Outback, or even seen a picture of Australia, idea of the <br/>\nOutback. But good if you like to see Alan! <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the attraction? Its his lips, his eyes, his hair, his voice... He has <br/>\ngreat timing as an actor. (and he has a great body!) He comes across as very <br/>\ndominant, powerful, rich! He is such a great actor, that other actors, who <br/>\nshall remain nameless, have cut many of his scenes out of their movies. I&#39;m <br/>\nsure because the nameless actor was so insecure of his own acting abilities <br/>\nthat he realized that Rickman overshadowed him. I am sure what the nameless <br/>\nactor really wanted to do was cut Rickman totally out of his movie, but then <br/>\nyou can&#39;t have a good guy running through the forest without a villainous <br/>\nsheriff now can you? <br/>\n<br/>\nI have heard that he is or was participating in a project to film all 19 <br/>\nplays by Samuel Beckett. Released on television in Ireland and then the UK <br/>\nand then sometime, maybe, in America in theaters. I did not like the movie <br/>\n*The Search for John Gissing* But Alan was very funny in it. IMHO, the <br/>\ndirector should have used Janeane Garofalo and Alan Rickman more, it would <br/>\nhave made a much better dark comedy.
