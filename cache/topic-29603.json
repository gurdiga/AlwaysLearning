My daughter even drew up a graph to watch prices within the World of Warcraft.  Amazing!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;d like to read about her venture into the world of economics,  its at my blog today. :)  And she also wrote about it at her blog. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kelli~<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ourjoyfullife.blogspot.com/\">http://ourjoyfullife.blogspot.com/</a>  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one&#39;s courage.&quot;  ~Anais Nin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nPinpoint customers who are looking for what you sell. <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Kelli Traaseth especially, but anyone...","postDate":"1182898425","msgId":29603,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ3NkJDMUE4LUI1QTYtNDNCNy1COERGLUQ5QTMyQzZCQzdBRUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":29606,"prevInTime":29602,"nextInTime":29604,"topicId":29603,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"http://lyricsgame.blogspot.com/ Kelli, there s a message for you there.
