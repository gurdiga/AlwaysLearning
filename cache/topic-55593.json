It makes me think about testing: WHEN will someone be completely stranded, alone, without phone access and unable to look up information, and to know the &#39;right&#39; answer *right then* will be vital?!

Highly specialized workers do, sometimes, where they need to have been tested to know they know. (I&#39;m thinking of surgeons.) But for most folks? The answer is nearly always close, and almost never vitally important in one second. Tests have nothing to do with most of real life.

Not appropriate.  Not the purpose of the  <br/>\nlist.   The reason there IS a list that stays on topic (95% of the  <br/>\ntime or more, I think) is that I have been unwilling to wander off and  <br/>\nsay &quot;whatever.&quot;  A dozen other lists have been either abandoned at one  <br/>\ntime or another and picked up by others with different beliefs and  <br/>\npriorities, or the owners find themselves too &quot;friendly&quot; to say no to  <br/>\npeople who are being &quot;friendly&quot; and it becomes a wad of friendly vague  <br/>\nfriendliness.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m unwilling to gather unschoolers together and then offer them up to  <br/>\nbe measured or tested.<br/>\nMaybe one line parents could offer their kids is &quot;My parents don&#39;t  <br/>\nbelieve in testing.&quot;<br/>\nThat will answer a lot of questions.
