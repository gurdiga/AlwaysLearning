Barney Frank (D-MA) and Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX) are preparing to<br/>\n&gt; reintroduce the States&#39; Rights to Medical Marijuana Act in Congress, and<br/>\n&gt; they are currently seeking co-sponsors willing to sign onto the measure<br/>\n&gt; when it is introduced within the next few days.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This bill (HR 2592 in the last Congress) would reschedule marijuana under<br/>\n&gt; federal law so those states that wish to legalize the medical use of<br/>\n&gt; marijuana under state law could do so without federal interference. If<br/>\n&gt; this bill were to be approved by Congress, federal prosecution of patients<br/>\n&gt; who qualify for medical use under state law would end, and states could<br/>\n&gt; actually provide medical marijuana to patients who qualify under state<br/>\n&gt; law. (This is a far more comprehensive, and far more important proposal,<br/>\n&gt; than the earlier measure (H.R. 1717) introduced by Rep. Farr and others to<br/>\n&gt; establish an affirmative defense of medical use under federal law.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please contact your representative in the U.S. Congress and urge him/her<br/>\n&gt; to co-sponsor this important piece of legislation. Tell them that Reps.<br/>\n&gt; Barney Frank and Ron Paul have today circulated a letter to all members of<br/>\n&gt; the House of Representatives seeking additional co-sponsors. They should<br/>\n&gt; contact Mark Levine on Rep. Barney Frank&#39;s staff (202-225-5931) to be<br/>\n&gt; listed as a co-sponsor.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please take two minutes to send a pre-written letter to your Congressman,<br/>\n&gt; asking them to co-sponsor the States&#39; Rights to Medical Marijuana Act by<br/>\n&gt; visiting:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://capwiz.com/norml2/issues/alert/?alertid=2204601&type=CO\">http://capwiz.com/norml2/issues/alert/?alertid=2204601&type=CO</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Special attention should be paid to the 40 members of the House of<br/>\n&gt; Representatives who were co-sponsors on the bill during the last session<br/>\n&gt; of Congress (see list below). If your representative is among this group,<br/>\n&gt; please call today (202-225-3121) and urge the member to sign on again as a<br/>\n&gt; co-sponsor.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Rep.
