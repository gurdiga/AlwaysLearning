Do you mean following the  <br/>\nsteps around the room that others have taken, or do you mean dancing <br/>\nin whatever way your feet move?  I think that the reason unschooling <br/>\nlists are full of questions about how unschooling works is because <br/>\nthere isn&#39;t a definable how.  Unschooling works when you stop <br/>\nschooling and start exploring. And it will work for them, but <br/>\nunschooling is as much about an adult learning as it is about a <br/>\nchild learning.  Unschooling is life.  How do you get life right?  <br/>\nAnd how can you make any guarantees about others ability to live <br/>\nlife?  And how can you reassure people who believe that schooling is <br/>\ndifficult that learning doesn&#39;t have to be?  You reach into your <br/>\nBuddhist bag and you live your life in the way that best <br/>\ndemonstrates a life well lived.  You make yourself accessible to <br/>\nquestions.  You become the showcase family for unschooling.  And, <br/>\nwell, haven&#39;t you done that.  If someone gets unschooling they get <br/>\nit.  Maybe with lots of help and encouragement and handholding. If <br/>\nsomeone doesn&#39;t get unschooling they get on-line (with all do <br/>\nrespect) and spout spelling rules as evidence that life cannot <br/>\nproduce all learning and that what they are doing is the best way to <br/>\ndo things.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think you are being too hard on yourself.  You cannot know what <br/>\nchild is a musician, nor what person is ripe for unschooling.  Who <br/>\nare you to tell people not to reach for the brass ring even if they <br/>\nare way, way too short?  Maybe they&#39;ll go over to the carnie section <br/>\nof the fair and win a grabber and come back and surprise you.  Or <br/>\nmaybe they won&#39;t, and when their child is 9 and not reading or <br/>\nspelling correctly they will turn away from unschooling.  And they <br/>\nwill say that unschooling didn&#39;t serve them, that it is a bogus and <br/>\nfraudulant system and that Sandra Dodd is a silly old cow for <br/>\ntelling them that their child would end up knowing everything they <br/>\nneeded to know without being schooled at home.
