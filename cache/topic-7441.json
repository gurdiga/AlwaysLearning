One way to do <br/>\nit is to make it look like it comes from a person you know.  To do that, it <br/>\nwill grab subject lines, even little pieces of the message itself.  I got <br/>\none like that a while back from one of my writing lists.  I almost opened <br/>\nit before I thought to wonder why the person would answer with an <br/>\nattachment to me rather than a post to the list.<br/>\nYour first line of defense is good virus protection, updated regularly.  I <br/>\nuse PC-Cillin which offers a time-limited trial version.  You can set it to <br/>\nupdate automatically whenever you go online.  Absolutely do that!  Mine <br/>\nchecks every time I go online and finds a new virus definition file on <br/>\naverage every 2 or 3 days.  That means there&#39;s a new virus or new version <br/>\nof an old virus coming out that often.  Any virus protection that will do <br/>\nthat is probably ok, though I&#39;ve had enough problems with McAfee that I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t recommend it.<br/>\nYour next line of defense is to be extremely skeptical of attachments.  My <br/>\ncousins sent me a fancy Christmas card last year that was actually a <br/>\nprogram (with a .exe extension).  They were a little miffed when I wrote <br/>\nback to ask if they really sent it, but I just can&#39;t afford to get a virus.<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one can make you feel inferior without your consent.<br/>\nEleanor Roosevelt<br/>\n*********************************************<br/>\nTia Leschke<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\nOn Vancouver Island</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":9440128,"authorName":"ElissaJC@concentric.net","from":"&lt;ElissaJC@...&gt;","profile":"elissajc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] attachment caution","postDate":"1023106622","msgId":7446,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxMzMwMWMyMGFmOCQ5Mjc5ODVjMCQxYjJhMDM0MEBFbGlzc2FKQz4="},"prevInTopic":7445,"nextInTopic":7450,"prevInTime":7445,"nextInTime":7447,"topicId":7441,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"?
