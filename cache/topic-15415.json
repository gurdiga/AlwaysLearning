They came to find me, all excited, to show me this:  stand <br/>\nfacing a wall so that one outstretched hand can just touch the wall by <br/>\nthe tips of your fingers.  Touch the wall.  Now bend that same arm quite <br/>\nhard and rub your elbow with the other hand.  Now try to touch the wall <br/>\nagain with the original arm.  Your arm won&#39;t reach.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo the girls and I thought this was amazing and wierd and we ran all <br/>\nover the house doing it over and over.  We called the grandparents and <br/>\nall our friends to have them do it.  It was fun and strange. I was <br/>\nwondering why this happened and thought a lot about it.  As usual, I was <br/>\ntalking about the hows and whys to the girls.  I finally decided that it <br/>\nmust happen because when the arm is bent, the muscle contracts and <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t completely stretch out right away, thus making the arm appear <br/>\nmagically shorter.  Makes sense to me.  The whole elbow rubbing thing is <br/>\njust for drama, like a magicians waving wand.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen Aislinn burst into tears and was furious with me for ruining the <br/>\nfun.  Since I had figured it out, the magic of it was gone.  And I felt <br/>\nSO bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it&#39;s made me think a lot about facts people have figured out over <br/>\ntime and what those facts have ultimately done to us and whether we&#39;ve <br/>\nbecome better for all the knowing.  An example: Before people new how <br/>\nbabies were made, babies were a gift, a miracle (of course their <br/>\nsurvival rate was much lower, so that added to their value as well).  I <br/>\nwonder what that must have been like to have a baby and look on it as  a <br/>\npure blessing unto me.  Not that I don&#39;t feel that way about my girls, <br/>\nbut not knowing all the hows and whys of it all, how would I have felt? <br/>\n And what other things that we do every day have lost their magic, their <br/>\nmystery to become commenplace?  The sun rising, the moon, rainbows.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I am glad to know so much especially about medical things. <br/>\n But I feel sad that our world feels the need to find all the answers. <br/>\n Even religions are based on finding the answers to questions like where <br/>\ndid we come from and where do we go when we die.  For myself, I don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to know these things.  I don&#39;t need to.  What matters is now and <br/>\nhere.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about and thought I&#39;d share <br/>\nit with you, especially since my faux pas with the e-mail about the baby <br/>\nholding the doctor&#39;s hand.  I never even picked up on the religious <br/>\naspect or the pro-life part.  I just thought it sounded beautifully <br/>\nmagical.  In retrospect, I can easily see it was ridiculous.  So it goes...<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a great day everybody.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15388,"nextTopicId":15417}}
