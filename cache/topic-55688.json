(I am not going to write on this anymore because I am pretty sure I &#39;get it&#39; from what was written.)<br/>\nIt really helped to hear stories of others who are living and learning through financial meltdown.  Life has become so sweet for our family since becoming part of this list. Sometimes I get suck because the old baggage comes up and takes hold of my thoughts and then I check in and it melts away again.  You have all made a difference in my life and the lives of my family. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoanne, Vega 8, Dutch 6, Geneva 4<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kelly Halldorson&quot; &lt;kelly@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There was a thread here that inspired me to write this blog entry.
