The legality of our marriage status is as unconventional as our educational philosophy! We were married 20 years ago, then got divorced a few years later. We reconciled and never remarried. Then last year we decided we would like to have a wedding, but didn&#39;t see any need for it to be &quot;official&quot; so instead of a marriage celebrant, we wrote our own ceremony, exchanged promises & rings, and had readings by my sister and our daughter. We did other cool stuff, a candle lighting ceremony, I sang a song to Ralph. It was very powerful and meaningful. A license couldn&#39;t have made it any better. In fact, having a stranger involved would have been out of place. All our family and friends were there,and while some of them were a bit dubious to start with, they all agreed afterwards that it had been a &quot;real&quot; wedding and they were very moved.<br/>\n<br/>\nKerrin.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Even for <br/>\n  my wedding, I only wore mascara and lip gloss. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Rhonda<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":112038769,"authorName":"Shyrley","from":"Shyrley &lt;shyrley.williams@...&gt;","profile":"bobalinga","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] grey hair/make-up","postDate":"1050532608","msgId":13683,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNFOUREQjAwLjM0QjUyOTE4QHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDMwNDE2LjExMzU0OS4yMTIuMi5mcmVlZm9ybUBqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":13682,"nextInTopic":13685,"prevInTime":13682,"nextInTime":13684,"topicId":13638,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
