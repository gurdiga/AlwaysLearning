A<br/>\ndemocratic meeting should mean that all parties have an equal voice. But in<br/>\na family, parents are basically benign dictators. They may choose not to<br/>\nweild their authority but there&#39;s no getting around that they can veto<br/>\nanything at anytime &quot;just because&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to have democratic meetings in a family, parents need to be ultra aware<br/>\nof that role. It&#39;s too easy to slip into the role of judge and decision<br/>\nmaker and &quot;persuader to the right point of view&quot; rather than give that up<br/>\nand be one of the &quot;peons&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Not that I think as a rule that they should give up veto power. They should<br/>\njust be aware of the imbalance of power and guard against slipping into that<br/>\nrole unconsciously when what is really called for is listening respectfully<br/>\nto all points of view, not just the ones we agree with or line up with our<br/>\nthinking.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when discussing going on a family vacation in a democratic family meeting<br/>\nwho the suggestions come from shouldn&#39;t matter. Everyone&#39;s ideas should be<br/>\ntaken equally seriously since to the person their suggestions *are* just as<br/>\nserious as anyone else&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscussing what to do about one person&#39;s actions towards another and what<br/>\npunishment, had more the aspects of a trial than a meeting. The child&#39;s<br/>\nguilt was already predetermined. The only part that needed settled was to<br/>\nhave the child publicly admit wrong doing and to choose his punishment.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"J.
