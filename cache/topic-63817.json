If you named specific ones, I would say the same thing<br/>\nabout them as Lego. My family LOVED pattern blocks and so I bought several<br/>\nsets and invested in the really nice wooden ones.

Those are &quot;math manipulatives&quot; - at<br/>\nleast that&#39;s how they are sold.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also had geoboards - lots of fun with those. Cuisenaire rods are cool<br/>\nbecause of the relationships between the rods - the kids played with them<br/>\nsometimes in various ways.

When I go in school supply stores or look at their<br/>\nwebsites, I look for the cool stuff. It is harder to find these days - in<br/>\nthe late 80&#39;s and early 90&#39;s school supply stores were filled with cool<br/>\nmath and science and literature stuff...those were the days of &quot;whole<br/>\nlanguage&quot; and &quot;constructivist mathematics&quot; and &quot;hands-on science&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;authentic assessment&quot; (that last means not doing paper and pencil tests).<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, be careful not to think math manipulatives are better than Legos or<br/>\nblocks just because they are sold in school supply stores.
