His hearing was fine, but he had a whole lot of ear wax.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve never been sure if the intervention helped or if he would have picked it <br/>\nall up anyway.  FWIW, at 2 he tested at the 15 month level, at 3 he tested at <br/>\nthe 4 year level.  I&#39;m not sure what the levels are anymore, but at the time <br/>\nI did a whole lot of research.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe started really talking through music.  We have been taking a music class <br/>\nsince he was 18 months old and he loves to sing.  So his first sentences were <br/>\nsongs.  We made up songs for everything.  &quot;This is the way we brush our <br/>\nteeth, brush our teeth, brush our teeth, this is the way we brush our teeth <br/>\nso early in the morning.&quot;  Even now he is interested in math and we&#39;ve made <br/>\nup a scale song for addition.  So, had we kept on with just the singing and <br/>\nnot done the early intervention program, he might have had the same results.<br/>\n<br/>\nearly intervention used to be a bigger business when the state picked up all <br/>\nthe costs.  But in the last two years, Illinois has changed the definitions <br/>\nand far fewer kids are being treated.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had the testing done at the house, for the most part.  They evaluated him <br/>\non a lot of things, not just speech.  He didn&#39;t jump on two feet at 2 either, <br/>\nfor some reason.  And I was really worried about his speech.  I remember <br/>\nbegging and pleading with him, trying to get him to say things, crying over <br/>\nit.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe responded well to the therapy because he thought his therapist had the <br/>\nbest toys.  She was really good at picking up on what he was good at and <br/>\nusing it as a tool to get him to speak.  Puzzles were a favorite, for <br/>\nexample.  He just thought of it as a play group.  My dd and I went with him, <br/>\nso we all had fun.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving his hearing tested might not be a bad idea.  Or you could just stand <br/>\nbehind him and whisper about something he&#39;s interested in, like chocolate <br/>\nchip cookies.  If you can find a good speech therapist, it really can&#39;t hurt. <br/>\n But you have to zone out all their paperwork bullshit stuff. Of course, the <br/>\nstate may pick it up and then you&#39;ll be part of that general filing system.  <br/>\nI refused to have him tested by the school district here at age three because <br/>\nI didn&#39;t really want them to know we existed.  The goals they set have to be <br/>\nyours and you need to participate actively.  I would never let a session <br/>\nhappen without me being there.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a tricky dilemma.

(Remember the <br/>\nanxiety you get with your first baby about how often they pooped <br/>\nand what it looked like?)<br/>\nB was a very quiet baby and a shy anxious toddler but he <br/>\ndeveloped normally. Walking and talking. He had terrible excma <br/>\n(sp?) which didn&#39;t clear up until I took him to a homeopath. And I <br/>\nmean terrible. From the neck down he was a mass of sores that <br/>\ncracked and weeped. I had severe PND plus H who I&#39;ve described <br/>\nbefore (think Atilla the Hun) and R who was a baby so the conty <br/>\nhelped me with a nursery place for the older two. It was them that <br/>\nfirst reported that he seemed odd. By the time he went to skool at <br/>\n4 it was obvious. He wouldn&#39;t look at people, he screamed when <br/>\nthere was loud noises, he threw tantrums when I moved anything in <br/>\nthe house. At skool he hid under the desk much of the time and <br/>\nlashed out at other kids if they were noisy. He cvouldn&#39;t cope with <br/>\nstrong smells or tastes. If I tried to hold him he went rigid  - like a <br/>\nsurfboard. You could tuck him under one arm. He couldn&#39;t bear to <br/>\nbe touched. Changing his nappy was an ordeal. He became afriad <br/>\nof the toilet - the noise and the fact it is a big hole. He wouldn&#39;t eat <br/>\ncos it made his tummy feel strange (ie.Full).<br/>\nI started by saying his name when I spoke to him. Every single <br/>\ntime. We kept the TV volume low, didn&#39;t change the furniture. <br/>\nGradually I got him to look at me when we spoke. Nothing <br/>\naggressive but sometimes I would guide his chin so that we looked <br/>\ninto each other&#39;s eyes. I sat next to him at bedtime and read <br/>\nstories and asked him what he thought. At first he didn&#39;t answer <br/>\nbut gradually he began to offer opinions about the story and <br/>\neventully came out with his thoughts about the day. A friend who <br/>\nwas a Shiatsu practitioner gave him free sessions. That really <br/>\nhelped. As did homeopathy.<br/>\nWhen B was 6 and a half he hugged me for the first time ever. It <br/>\nreally was a slow gradual process of getting him to interact with the <br/>\nworld, to take note that there were other people in it. I always made <br/>\nsure I was looking into his eyes when I spoke to him. At 6 we <br/>\nbought him a kitten. He still has her and she&#39;s his best friend. <br/>\nFortunately she&#39;s one of those loyal cats and follows him <br/>\neverywhere. That cat made a huge difference in his life.<br/>\nB now seems almost &#39;normal&#39; but I still can&#39;t touch him without <br/>\npermission. He will hug me often but dislikes being hugged back.<br/>\nTaking him away from skool when he was 7 made an enormous <br/>\ndifference. He stopped being an angry tired little boy and began to <br/>\nexplore the world on his own terms.<br/>\nMost of it is standing back and seeing how he likes to interact and <br/>\nthen responding to that. When he&#39;s tired or upset he reverts into a <br/>\nwithdrawn child and refuses to communicate.<br/>\nHope that helps. It wasn&#39;t very well written cos I&#39;ve never really <br/>\nthought about how I did it, I just did it. It was slow and took several <br/>\nyears but not once did I think about taking him to see an &#39;expert&#39;. <br/>\nThat would have traumatised him greatly so I just followed my <br/>\ninstincts.<br/>\n<br/>\nShyrley<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You laugh at me because I&#39;m different.

His older sister did most of his <br/>\ntalking for him, he used gestures or he screamed in frustration/rage to <br/>\ncommunicate!  When he did decide to speak, it was in full sentences.  His <br/>\nfirst sentence was &#39;Me want donut!&#39; in a most imperious tone and he hasn&#39;t <br/>\nshut up since.  He played alongside kids until he was maybe 5 or 6 or <br/>\nsomething then played with them.  He&#39;s also extremely agile.  I call him my <br/>\ntree-monkey or mountain-goat because he&#39;s always clambering up on <br/>\nsomething.  ...and he can tune out like anything.

He likes to know what&#39;s going to <br/>\nhappen with him, what it&#39;ll be like, how long it&#39;ll take and the power to <br/>\nsay &#39;no way&#39; to it if he doesn&#39;t want to do it.  But then, maybe that&#39;s all <br/>\nof us who are that way.  He very much likes to know what&#39;s going to happen <br/>\nnext, versus just going with the flow.  He doesn&#39;t like a lot of change in <br/>\nroutine or surroundings (unless he&#39;s causing the change!)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow he&#39;s 13.  He&#39;s still a tree-monkey and tunes us out when he&#39;s busy.  He <br/>\nadores things mechanical or electronic.  He doesn&#39;t like to read, but <br/>\nenjoys books-on-CD.  He&#39;s brilliant at math and he has a goodly number of <br/>\nwonderful friends.  He likes going to sleep-away camp and has a riot while <br/>\nhe&#39;s there.  He&#39;s great at interior design.  He still doesn&#39;t like a lot of <br/>\nchange, unless he&#39;s causing it.  If it were totally up to him, he&#39;d wear <br/>\nthe same shirt for a week, grungy and everything.  (I ask him to humor me <br/>\nand change, please.)  He&#39;s not romantically interested in girls yet (or <br/>\nboys, for that matter.)  He&#39;s incredibly bright, interested in the world <br/>\nand good at video games.  He keeps trying to teach me how to play them so <br/>\nwe can play online together and I can&#39;t quiet manage it... maybe &#39;cause I&#39;m <br/>\nnot really into them.  Poor kid.  He loves chess and is always looking for <br/>\nsomeone to play with.  ...and poker.  He&#39;s built a remote control glider <br/>\nall by himself (well, with the hubby pitching in on some of the <br/>\n4-hand-needing glue bits) although he still has to reverse the servos.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, he&#39;s a pretty great and &#39;normal&#39; kid, and he sounds a lot like your <br/>\nkid at 3.  I wouldn&#39;t worry about his behavior at this stage.  ...and if <br/>\nyou think you&#39;re kid is pretty great now, think of what a great kid he&#39;ll <br/>\nbe when he&#39;s 13!!!<br/>\nHeidi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 11:38 AM 11/15/2002 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Does anyone have experience when it comes to late talking children (3 years<br/>\n&gt;+)  I have a  3 year old son who doesn&#39;t really talk ( he says a few words<br/>\n&gt;like me, no way, cup) but mainly hands you something like a cup to indicate<br/>\n&gt;he wants you to get him something to drink or pulls on leg to get you to get<br/>\n&gt;up and follow him.

She sat down on the floor with him and chatted with <br/>\nme about toys, and wildlife. All sorts of things. She also played <br/>\nwith the toys herself. The same way that toddlers often play <br/>\nalongside each other without acknowledging the others presence.<br/>\nSometimes I wonder whether a private paediatrician who is being <br/>\npaid by the patient might have been more pro-active in finding <br/>\nsomething wrong with R. Free medicine certainly cuts back on <br/>\nthat. But I&#39;m terrible cynical about doctors here.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs irony would have it, it is my middle child who is autistic.

The idea<br/>\n&gt;   of <br/>\n&gt; taking him to the pediatrician makes me exhausted.  He resists<br/>\n&gt; anything like that.  So I can&#39;t imagine them trying to diagnose him<br/>\n&gt; while he is screaming.  He doesn&#39;t usually like other people.

Do you get any &#39;alone&#39; <br/>\ntime with him?<br/>\nIt would probably really upset him if you took him and might make <br/>\nhim feel that you were not on his side.<br/>\nMy youngest is very self sufficent. He plays with his brother but <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t really need friends. He&#39;s happy if we *do* see people but <br/>\njust as happy to stay home for weeks on end without seeing <br/>\nanyone but family.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   The bottom line is that I don&#39;t want him labeled.

But what if he is just who he is and is just very<br/>\n&gt; immature.  How do I know the difference?  He is very different from<br/>\n&gt; his siblings.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think there is any &#39;window&#39;.

Do I sound like a worried mom or what?   Anybody ever<br/>\n&gt; felt like this?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I certainly did. The early intervention here is all about money. The <br/>\nmore we take our children to &#39;experts&#39; the more money they get. <br/>\nDoctors would be bankrupt if everyone was &#39;well&#39;!<br/>\nHe sounds like an introvert to me.
