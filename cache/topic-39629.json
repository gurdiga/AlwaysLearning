Her therapists have long supported our homeschooling <br/>\nover putting her in institutional school, but the assumption has <br/>\nbeen that I am actively working with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, I just don&#39;t know how to make the switch from mom-directed <br/>\nto unschooling. Is this something that I should introduce with the <br/>\ngirls by an announcement?   Should I just stop directing and see <br/>\nwhat happens?   How do I get four girls who totally expect me to <br/>\ndirect their learning to make a switch and assume some <br/>\nresponsibility?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow have people made this transition?    My girls have never been in <br/>\ninstitutional school, but they are used to my imposed structure.   I <br/>\nhave planned time for my reading to them, and I typically pick the <br/>\nbooks I want to read based on my concept of what material I want to <br/>\ncover.   I pick out math texts and I have structured time for doing <br/>\nmath lessons, where I make myself available to assist.    I <br/>\npick &quot;living books&quot; for history and science, and I &quot;assign&quot; what the <br/>\ngirls read, although of course they also choose their own books at <br/>\nlibraries and bookstores. There is definitely free time during the <br/>\nday where they make their own schedule, but I am definitely <br/>\nmaintaining control of an academic atmosphere.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAll girls are heavily involved in dance.   They take multiple <br/>\nlessons each week, ranging from four classes for the youngest to <br/>\nseven for the older two.   Add on rehearsals for Nutcracker and <br/>\nspring performances.   We spend two to four weeks every year in <br/>\nFlorida where the girls read obsessively and swim, a nice break from <br/>\na Montana winter.   We spend our summers at a cottage on a Canadian <br/>\nlake, and the girls do lots of whining there because they are away <br/>\nfrom the dance studio.  Three of the girls take piano lessons and <br/>\nall four take a knitting class at a local shop, which we&#39;ve <br/>\ncontinued well past their picking up basic knitting skills becausre <br/>\nwe&#39;ve enjoyed it so much.   The girls knit quite a bit, making gifts <br/>\nfor friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nI should add that we live 25 miles from town, so they are dependent <br/>\non my driving to get to town to the library or other activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never direct during the summer months or the weeks we spend in <br/>\nFlorida.   This fall I thought about just not making a switch in <br/>\nSeptember, but the girls kept talking about what we would be doing <br/>\nfor &quot;school&quot; and I feel back into traditional territory of my <br/>\nplanning, my directing.  This is what we&#39;re all used to.   They <br/>\nexpect it, and I&#39;m in a rut.   One of the girls is getting major <br/>\npressure from friends to go to public school.   She likes the idea <br/>\nof being able to talk about what she&#39;s doing in a way that her <br/>\npublic school friends can relate to.   I&#39;m not sure if she would see <br/>\nunschooling as adequate initially.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne motivation for making a change is that I&#39;m slowing down because <br/>\nI&#39;m aging.    I turn 62 in December, and because we started our <br/>\nfamily late (first child born when I was 31) and then we adopted six <br/>\nafter the two bio sons, my husband and I are still parenting and <br/>\nwill be until the 12 year old moves on.   I love parenting.    I&#39;ve <br/>\nloved homeschooling.   But I&#39;m tired.   I don&#39;t want to feel I&#39;m <br/>\nbailing out of homeschooling, but I&#39;m tired of the &quot;school&quot; nature <br/>\nto our lives.  I just don&#39;t know how to change.   I don&#39;t want it to <br/>\nlook as if I&#39;m abandoning the mom control because I&#39;m OLD.   I would <br/>\nlike the girls to see this as a positive move in our lives, but I <br/>\njust don&#39;t know how to go about making a change. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice on how to make the switch?<br/>\n<br/>\nElaine in Montana</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32076,"nextTopicId":39653}}
