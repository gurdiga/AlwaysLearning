She&#39;s grieving. It&#39;s hard to see it that way since the door isn&#39;t entirely closed as it would be if you moved across the country.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe solution she&#39;s come up with is making the 45 minute trip to the Montessori school. But she&#39;s idealizing it. As you&#39;ve observed she really doesn&#39;t want to make that drive everyday. It&#39;s just that she doesn&#39;t see any other way.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re trying to give her what she&#39;s asking for to fix her feelings. It&#39;s like it&#39;s raining on the day a picnic was planned. You *could* worry that she&#39;s disappointed and call up a big tent company to erect a tent. You could rent spotlights that simulate the sun.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you&#39;re doing well exploring new options so she can move on. But add in some respect that she will feel sad for a while. You can say, &quot;It would be nice if we could snap our fingers and be at their house!&quot; with the same tone you&#39;d use about the rain.
