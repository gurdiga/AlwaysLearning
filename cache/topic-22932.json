The article itself is interesting (and somewhat <br/>\nirritating), but I wanted to bring this passage here for examination.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Jane Healy, an educational psychologist in Colorado, is much more wary.<br/>\nHealy isn&#39;t against video games but she is concerned about overuse and an<br/>\nincreasing reliance on computers in schools. The author of Failure to<br/>\nConnect: How Computers Affect Our Children&#39;s Minds, she argues that<br/>\nchildren have to be supervised properly both at home and at school to make<br/>\nsure they are, indeed, learning and don&#39;t fall into dangerous territory.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The bottom line is parents have to be on top of this. This is not a benign<br/>\ntechnology.

The kids are the ones that are going to<br/>\nsuffer the outcome. There is a cardinal rule to be developed here: it&#39;s to<br/>\nbe cautious - this could be dangerous stuff; it can also be useful.
