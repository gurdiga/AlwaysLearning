We had a new family move into our neighborhood a little less than a year ago. It is a dad who has his two kids every other weekend. Well, the younger one is a girl, and she was in Kindergarten last year. When she was over here one day she told me something along the lines of, &quot;Well, I just don&#39;t see how your kids are getting any smarter.&quot; A Kindergartener said that! I mean, they start indoctrinating them early, don&#39;t they?? <br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: autonomousangela <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, June 06, 2005 6:40 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Honesty VS Politeness?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  The kids are happy and have a couple <br/>\n  new horsey friends.
