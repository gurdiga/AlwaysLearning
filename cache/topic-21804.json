This description above reminds me to my oldest,<br/>\nwho is like a barometer for what&#39;s inside others.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know if I would call it intuitive in his case,<br/>\nbecause he doesn&#39;t seem aware often of why he feels<br/>\nthe way he does, or to understand these feelings, but<br/>\nit&#39;s obvious that he&#39;s picking up on what others are<br/>\nfeeling.  He amplifies these emotions he picks up from<br/>\nothers, and always echos them back tenfold in an<br/>\nautistic parroting kind of way, even if he doesn&#39;t<br/>\nseem to really be feeling that way at all (like acting<br/>\nout an angry rage while trying not to laugh, etc.)  He<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t even have to speak to or interact with people<br/>\nhe&#39;s amplifying, just be in their general physical<br/>\nvacinity.  It&#39;s often spooky.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis emotional radar is very strong, but with his<br/>\nautism, he often can&#39;t understand from people&#39;s tone<br/>\nof voice, facial expressions, and body language what<br/>\nthey are communicating (like when people are angry,<br/>\nsad, etc.)  It&#39;s makes for complicated and frustrating<br/>\n(particularly for him) communication problems to have<br/>\nall this internal emotional information without<br/>\nknowing where it is coming from or what to do with it.<br/>\n Fortunately he&#39;s very verbal and what one therapist<br/>\ncalled &quot;highly gifted&quot; and so he is learning, slowly<br/>\nand painfully and through unconventioanl pathways, to<br/>\nread and understand this social information and act on<br/>\nit appropriately.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact we&#39;ve been told we&#39;ve done miracles with him<br/>\nfor overcoming his particular challenges, but we take<br/>\nlittle credit for that.  It was/is unschooling that is<br/>\nresponsible, not drugging him or sticking him into a<br/>\nspecial ed program at school (where he would<br/>\ndefinately go if he were in school) or massive<br/>\ntherapies, or expecting him to fit into anyone&#39;s box. <br/>\nJust being at home, where it&#39;s emotionally and<br/>\nphysically &quot;safe&quot; and comfortable for him (he&#39;s VERY<br/>\nsensory defensive with all his senses) does miraculous<br/>\nthings for his ability to be less stressed out by his<br/>\nenvironment and spend more time learning and growing<br/>\nand being his brilliant self.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy younger son I would call intuitive.  He<br/>\ninstinctively knows when someone needs a joke or<br/>\ncomforting or to be left alone, he cries when other<br/>\npeople are hurt, and he understands how they are<br/>\nfeeling even if they don&#39;t say a word, but he doesn&#39;t<br/>\njust recieve those unfiltered feelings and act them<br/>\nout in an amplified manner and without understanding. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21791,"nextTopicId":16184}}
