We got rid of ours about a year ago. This after increasingly being<br/>\ndisappointed/disgusted/dismayed at the programming content (rather limited<br/>\nin South-Africa, unless you have satellite TV). When we realised that there<br/>\nhadn&#39;t been anything worth watching for the last (in our opinion of course)<br/>\nfor the last 3 months, and we still had to pay the TV license every month,<br/>\nwe began to rethink the situation. The kids had always enjoyed videos, but<br/>\nthen the video machine died on us. So the TV went. There were momentary<br/>\nregrets, and every now and then one or another of us really wishes we had a<br/>\nTV to watch (usually when we are feeling tired and would be better off<br/>\nasleep), but on the whole none of us REALLY miss it. There are so many other<br/>\nthings to do. Since our parents died, hubby and I have become so much more<br/>\naware of the brevity of life. Maybe this has produced an unfair pressure in<br/>\nour family - I don&#39;t know. But there are only 24 precious hours a day. I<br/>\nlove living life, not watching other people live it. However, I do like<br/>\nreading, so I guess I am contradicting myself - reading is a kind of<br/>\n&#39;&#39;watching&#39;&#39;, isn&#39;t it!!!<br/>\nIf we really want to watch something in particular, we pack up and head for<br/>\nthe office - there is a TV in the boardroom and the kids think it&#39;s great<br/>\nfun, watching TV at dad&#39;s work! This is once every 2 months or so.<br/>\nI don&#39;t regret the decision not to have a TV for now. We will see what<br/>\nhappens in the future. I guess that if it became a really important need for<br/>\na member of the family, we would consider the acquisition of another one,<br/>\nalong with a video machine (we always felt that we wouldn&#39;t want to have the<br/>\none without the other - we refuse to be dictated to by the time schedules of<br/>\na silly black box).<br/>\nI know many people find TV useful/entertaining/helpful/whatever.

He seems to do a lot of his learning by watching.  We <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have a TV in the house for around 10 years.  I thought I had the <br/>\nperfect solution.  There are 2 TVs next door at the in-laws, and my guys <br/>\nwould watch over there.  At first, Lars wasn&#39;t comfortable alone in their <br/>\nbasement, so he really only watched when his dad did.  Then he got <br/>\ncomfortable over there and started practically living there.  They both <br/>\ndid.  My dh basically moved his office over there and would watch while <br/>\ndoing paperwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took me a long time, but I finally decided that having a home life <br/>\n*with* TV was better than no home life without it.  I was also concerned <br/>\nabout Lars sitting over there by himself night after night after we had <br/>\ngone to bed.  So last week we got a TV and cable.  It&#39;s really not as bad <br/>\nhaving it in the house as I thought it would be.  They&#39;re keeping the <br/>\nvolume low enough so I can tune it out if I want to.  (Very small <br/>\nhouse)  I&#39;ve even been looking in the TV guide for things I might like to <br/>\nwatch.  I doubt I&#39;ll ever watch much.  (I&#39;d much rather play the email <br/>\ngame.)  But I think in the long run it&#39;s going to be a good thing.  And I&#39;m <br/>\nalso seeing what a variety of shows Lars watches.  He watches stuff I&#39;d <br/>\ncall junk, and I keep my mouth shut.  But now that it&#39;s in the house, I see <br/>\nhow much he watches that I could call &quot;educational&quot;.

It is not useful to continue to &quot;debate&quot; this issue<br/>\nand defend my position to someone who disagrees because I really dont care<br/>\nif you disagree with my post, I was not posting to create a discourse with<br/>\nyou, simply to make the connection with the parent who sounded like minded.<br/>\nNOT a crime I think so I will leave this court room guilt free.

So it was neutral turf, and my husband, son and I had no where<br/>\nto go to avoid the tv, and we have made a concious choice to avoid it, as<br/>\nfirmly as a nonsmoker avoids smoke filled houses if you understand what I<br/>\nmean.  So it felt like a violation. She had a tv she could watch in her own<br/>\nroom upstairs but chose to turn on the one in the livingroom, and so we<br/>\nneeded to hide out in the tiny little bedroom with my son and try and spend<br/>\nthe evening reading every book we could find and keep him and ourselves<br/>\nentertained, yet not having the &quot;visit&quot; we had spent so much money and time<br/>\nto go there and do.  This was sort of an evening ritual for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do not live near her, but if we did I would, as I said expect her to<br/>\nrespect our values and choices and not expose my son to tv.  Although tv<br/>\nviewers cannot understand this point of view (just like a smoker may not see<br/>\nthe big deal with smoke filled rooms)  I feel ANY exposure, especially in<br/>\nthe primary years, when he is still establishing his tastes, personality,<br/>\nand values, any exposure is toxic.  I realize this is not a common belief,<br/>\nbut that is not the point, the point is he is my responsibility, and  I have<br/>\nworked hard to protect his innocence as a child, that includes avoiding<br/>\nmedia like tv and videos.  If she was a smoker she would be expected not to<br/>\nsmoke in his presence.  Same thing.  Or she could choose to visit him at our<br/>\nhouse and follow our values, if she felt she should be able to do whatever<br/>\nshe wants in her house, regardless of his or our presence.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo your point about exposure some day, yes, very true.  In fact I have a<br/>\nplan for exposing him someday, when I feel instinctively the time is right,<br/>\nand he has some stronger sense of self, and will be less able to be<br/>\ndisturbed or affected by the images as he will understand how unreal they<br/>\noften are.  Also, we can explain the psychology behind manipulative<br/>\nprograming, advertising etc.  Now I do believe at a certain time it will be<br/>\nuseful to include videos with information he finds useful, especially during<br/>\nhomeschooling, and fullu expect to enjoy with him quality movies someday.<br/>\nBut as I said (an amazingly even the American Academy of Pediatrics agrees<br/>\nin their statement that no child under age of 2 should view any tv or video)<br/>\nthat the smaller years are not the time for this type of viewing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your thoughtful questions!<br/>\n<br/>\nTerrie<br/>\nMom of Oliver3.5 years<br/>\nMom of Benjamin (angel in my heart, would have been 5)<br/>\ngrowing new life due in July<br/>\n<br/>\nIt IS a personal choice, but just because your MIL does not have the same<br/>\nconvictions is she really the one at fault?

It was a personal choice<br/>\n before having children, it is not how I like to spend my time, and I<br/>\nbelieve<br/>\n it is a as you say a tool of the the advertisers, and popular culture which<br/>\n I am not a believer or participant in (ie wearing the &quot;brand name clothes&quot;<br/>\n perfumes, perfect body, and I do not like the way many programs show people<br/>\n treating each other, which is often shallow, cruel, or self serving, which<br/>\n is modeling behavior I disagree with, and since I believe modeling is how<br/>\n people and children learn to treat themselves and others it is not<br/>\nsomething<br/>\n I want to observe or have observed by my children. I think it is a personal<br/>\n choice, and if one disagrees with 90 percent of what is displayed on the<br/>\n screen (this goes for most children videos too) then it is a reasonable<br/>\n decision to exclude it from ones life, in the same way that if you disagree<br/>\n with smoking to not allow smokers in your home while they are smoking or<br/>\n have just smoked.  For me, it is not just a concern of how much will my<br/>\n child watch if I open the &quot;flood gates&quot;, and will my child self moderate<br/>\nthe<br/>\n amount.  It is for me, that I do not like most of what is on the tv, and it<br/>\n is such a passive activity, and a bit mind numbing.  I never realized  the<br/>\n effects the tv really had on me until I was tv free for a long time, and<br/>\n then had exposures (airport, etc) and saw how choppy and short the story<br/>\n lines and images were, how little time it gave for one to view a scene<br/>\n before flashing to another, and it actually was uncomfortable to watch<br/>\nthis.<br/>\n It is not the way the real world is, we don&#39;t see our world around us<br/>\n flashing and changing scenes and views so jarringly, I think it feels<br/>\n shocking to the system that has not accommodated to that type of visual<br/>\n stimuli, and I question the health of it.   I feel that myself and  my<br/>\n child are better off self stimulating or being with stimulating humans than<br/>\n a flashing inanimate box.  In the same way, I never used inanimate soothing<br/>\n devices for my child as an infant (i.e. pacifiers, swings, vibrating baby<br/>\n seats, fake heartbeats playing on a machine because I believed his nature<br/>\n was to need human contact and   human soothing.<br/>\n Now just because I choose to avoid tv, I am not sitting in judgement of<br/>\n others who choose tv.  I certainly also respect and uphold others choice to<br/>\n include tv, in the same way that I respect others food choices and<br/>\nreligious<br/>\n choices.  What I don&#39;t appreciate is when people (like my MIL) think my<br/>\n choice has no value, and chooses to have the tv on in front of my child<br/>\n behind my back, because she had decided my choice has not merit.  This is a<br/>\n violation, just as if she offered my child a food we avoided, or as an<br/>\nolder<br/>\n child allowed him to have alcohol or exposed him to cigarette smoke.  This<br/>\n is a lifestyle choice our family has made , we all agree on it, and it<br/>\nneeds<br/>\n to be respected.<br/>\n<br/>\n Well this is my first post on this board though I&#39;ve been a<br/>\n lurker....perhaps I won&#39;t be welcome after this (hee hee)<br/>\n Terrie mother of Oliver 3.5 years<br/>\n mother of Benjamin ( a dear  memory in my heart, would be 5 . 5 years)<br/>\n pregnant with new life due in July<br/>\n<br/>\n       Yahoo!

It was a personal choice<br/>\n  before having children, it is not how I like to spend my time, and I believe<br/>\n  it is a as you say a tool of the the advertisers, and popular culture which<br/>\n  I am not a believer or participant in (ie wearing the &quot;brand name clothes&quot;<br/>\n  perfumes, perfect body, and I do not like the way many programs show people<br/>\n  treating each other, which is often shallow, cruel, or self serving, which<br/>\n  is modeling behavior I disagree with, and since I believe modeling is how<br/>\n  people and children learn to treat themselves and others it is not something<br/>\n  I want to observe or have observed by my children. I think it is a personal<br/>\n  choice, and if one disagrees with 90 percent of what is displayed on the<br/>\n  screen (this goes for most children videos too) then it is a reasonable<br/>\n  decision to exclude it from ones life, in the same way that if you disagree<br/>\n  with smoking to not allow smokers in your home while they are smoking or<br/>\n  have just smoked.  For me, it is not just a concern of how much will my<br/>\n  child watch if I open the &quot;flood gates&quot;, and will my child self moderate the<br/>\n  amount.  It is for me, that I do not like most of what is on the tv, and it<br/>\n  is such a passive activity, and a bit mind numbing.  I never realized  the<br/>\n  effects the tv really had on me until I was tv free for a long time, and<br/>\n  then had exposures (airport, etc) and saw how choppy and short the story<br/>\n  lines and images were, how little time it gave for one to view a scene<br/>\n  before flashing to another, and it actually was uncomfortable to watch this.<br/>\n  It is not the way the real world is, we don&#39;t see our world around us<br/>\n  flashing and changing scenes and views so jarringly, I think it feels<br/>\n  shocking to the system that has not accommodated to that type of visual<br/>\n  stimuli, and I question the health of it.   I feel that myself and  my<br/>\n  child are better off self stimulating or being with stimulating humans than<br/>\n  a flashing inanimate box.  In the same way, I never used inanimate soothing<br/>\n  devices for my child as an infant (i.e. pacifiers, swings, vibrating baby<br/>\n  seats, fake heartbeats playing on a machine because I believed his nature<br/>\n  was to need human contact and   human soothing.<br/>\n  Now just because I choose to avoid tv, I am not sitting in judgement of<br/>\n  others who choose tv.  I certainly also respect and uphold others choice to<br/>\n  include tv, in the same way that I respect others food choices and religious<br/>\n  choices.  What I don&#39;t appreciate is when people (like my MIL) think my<br/>\n  choice has no value, and chooses to have the tv on in front of my child<br/>\n  behind my back, because she had decided my choice has not merit.  This is a<br/>\n  violation, just as if she offered my child a food we avoided, or as an older<br/>\n  child allowed him to have alcohol or exposed him to cigarette smoke.  This<br/>\n  is a lifestyle choice our family has made , we all agree on it, and it needs<br/>\n  to be respected.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well this is my first post on this board though I&#39;ve been a<br/>\n  lurker....perhaps I won&#39;t be welcome after this (hee hee)<br/>\n  Terrie mother of Oliver 3.5 years<br/>\n  mother of Benjamin ( a dear  memory in my heart, would be 5 . 5 years)<br/>\n  pregnant with new life due in July <br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
