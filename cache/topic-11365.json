I contacted the Better<br/>\n&gt; Business Bureau and found that the company has had no complaints<br/>\n&gt; lodged against them, I also contacted Paypal who guarantees the<br/>\n&gt; purchases made by consumers with this company. They told me that they<br/>\n&gt; verified the company&#39;s licenses, bank accounts and other paperwork<br/>\n&gt; indicating to them that the company is legitimate and thus they<br/>\n&gt; insure your purchases. Then I started asking co-workers and friends<br/>\n&gt; about this program and to my surprise 6 out of the 10 people that I<br/>\n&gt; spoke with were already using this program. They told me how pleased<br/>\n&gt; they were with it and how much money they had saved and are currently<br/>\n&gt; saving. So I decided to sign up for this program on 11/20/02. On<br/>\n&gt; 11/25/02 I received my complete membership package and the fun began.<br/>\n&gt; Using their program and the free lifetime membership that it includes<br/>\n&gt; I went to the supermarket ready to make a killing. The cashier rang<br/>\n&gt; up my grocery bill and it came out to $ 239.87 then I presented her<br/>\n&gt; with the coupons I received from this program and I saved $ 213.38 -<br/>\n&gt; my final bill was only $ 26.49! The cashier wasn&#39;t the only one<br/>\n&gt; shocked.
