He gets more frustrated. I have also tried looking up the walkthroughs, and he says it doesn&#39;t help. This is what is frustrating. I keep thinking there is more to his frustration but I can&#39;t figure it out. He is pretty impatient. He wants to beat it right now. He thinks if he can&#39;t beat it within a day or so, then he can&#39;t do it at all. Trying to help him seems to frustrate him more. And, he isn&#39;t asking for my help, so if I offer, it seems to make him mad. I do try to look up the games myself and offer some suggestions, most of the time, he won&#39;t take the help. But maybe I am going about it wrong, that&#39;s what I am trying to figure out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan says:<br/>\n&lt;What was your response?  Did you stop renting games and buying them?  Did you put a limit on how many he can have or when he can get a new one?

However, this was getting a bit expensive. The games are $7 to rent, and he has a brother that wants games too. So, we were spending about $50 a week, which we just can&#39;t continue. But the biggest factor was that he was just not happy with anything, which led to me trying to help him figure out where the frustration was coming from.

I think you are judging me by telling me I think he is a junkie. That is not true. I am happy to see him so excited about something. However, it seems to be making him unhappy, which makes me want to help. When I can&#39;t help him, it is difficult for me. So, I was merely stating my frustration and sadness that he seems discontent. And, I was thrilled to get it for them. They could choose which system they wanted, and they both voted for the PS2. I didn&#39;t grudgingly take them to the store and say, Ok, if you HAVE TO have this, go ahead, with a big frown on my face.

He started slowly, needing either dh or I there to read to him (he&#39;s since learned to read), encourage him, or even to help with the games.  He sat and played and played.  Sometimes he became *really* frustrated.  Still does.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  That was December of 2004.  We bought him Ty 2:  Bush Rescue on Sunday.  He&#39;s played through to the credits (he&#39;s been through the entire game) three times so far.  This morning though, we spent a good 40 minutes on line looking for a walkthrough then googling this and that for the help he needed.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I&#39;ve become his &quot;Minister of Information&quot;.  I read through the books that come inside the games and offer anything I think might help.  I find and deliver walkthroughs when needed.  I read things on the screen (some games have an option where they can read things to you) and from the walkthrough.  I help him brainstorm.  I listen and ask questions about his game.  We talk about how some games are similar and others stink, how some things are cool, and what we&#39;d change.  On occasion, I&#39;ve heard profanity and explained what the words meant and what profanity is.  In short, I&#39;m there with him as much as he needs me and I am able.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Play the games.  They&#39;re hard!!  I can&#39;t quite get myself past thinking &quot;if I want to jump, I have to press &#39;X&#39;&quot;, rather than just pressing the key, as ds does.  I can ram Spyro (a character from a game) into more walls and miss more jumps than you can count!!  I can also wreak a fair amount of havoc with Sly Cooper (another game character).  It may look easy, but it&#39;s not.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Ask your son questions.  Explain what the walkthrough is.  Offer it to him.  Offer him options for help, if he feels he needs it (try the Yahoo group, ask at the store, the walkthrough, google the part where he&#39;s stuck, feel free to e-mail me and I&#39;ll ask ds!!).  My son didn&#39;t want help until he became more proficient with the controller and not having to think to make a character do this or that.  Unil then, he spent a good part of his day working to master basic functions.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Perhaps games which aren&#39;t &quot;T&quot; would be a better bet for him to be able to learn on?  I&#39;m thinking that since the games are geared to teens, perhaps they&#39;re also needing a higher skill set as well??  We have *lots* of games to suggest!!  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Hope that helps some!!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Happy gaming, :-)<br/>\n  Jane<br/>\n  <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJane Powell <br/>\nTribe Commander <br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;If you bungle raising your children, I don&#39;t think anything you do well matters very much.&quot;   Jackie O <br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;You must be the change you wish to see in the world.&quot; - Gandhi <br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;The most wasted day is that in which we have not laughed.&quot; - Sebastien-Roch Chamfort<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Yahoo!

I have found that GameCube has a <br/>\nbetter selection of games for all ages...plus I adore all things Pokemon.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, have you played the games yourself?  Have you tried it?

We recently (about 2 months ago) bought a PS2, and my boys were thrilled (age 8). They have gotten many games and have been having lots of fun. Eric is not reading yet, and I think these games are making him frustrated. I am having a hard time figuring out the problem, but I am guessing it is because he has T rated games that require reading in alot of cases. He will ask us to tell him what some things say, but other times he chooses to skip over certain parts, which I think is making it very difficult to beat the games. He was used to playing games on his game boy and beating them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has become very sullen and just not the happy kid that I know. He constantly talks about how he wants this game and that game, but then when we get them he plays for awhile and then says they are stupid. He is so on edge that he will not talk about things in a very calm way. This is new ground for me and I am having a hard time. I don&#39;t know how to help him. His new idea is that the PS2 stinks and that now he wants a GameCube. It just keeps changing from new games to new systems to new this and that. He is searching for something but I don&#39;t know what! He has become mean and nasty to us and I know he is hurting,so I desperately want to help him. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas/suggestions/questions to ask myself or Eric?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you! <br/>\nAmie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24332,"nextTopicId":24584}}
