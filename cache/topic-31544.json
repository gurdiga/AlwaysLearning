I find that  I&#39;m arguing much less, <br/>\nso maybe that&#39;s why they are too.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSo now what I&#39;ve been feeling is more of mild annoyance  that people can&#39;t <br/>\njust talk about something else.  I wonder  if that&#39;s a bit like what it feels <br/>\nlike to be famous and have  people wanting your autograph all the time.  It&#39;s <br/>\nalways about  *that.*  So I guess what I&#39;m saying is that I&#39;ve finally <br/>\ndiscovered it  doesn&#39;t have to be, and maybe some people are just looking for something <br/>\n interesting to talk about, or like you said, dealing with their own  issues. <br/>\n And without the stress of feeling a *need* to  convince people I know what <br/>\nI&#39;m doing, I really don&#39;t mind so much.  <br/>\n <br/>\nPatty<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************************Check out AOL&#39;s list of 2007&#39;s hottest <br/>\nproducts.<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://money.aol.com/special/hot-products-2007?NCID=aoltop00030000000001)\">http://money.aol.com/special/hot-products-2007?NCID=aoltop00030000000001)</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":278937908,"authorName":"la_tree@verizon.net","from":"&lt;la_tree@...&gt;","profile":"mcclan113","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] my talk with a stranger","postDate":"1195801162","msgId":31546,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQwNjE4NjYuNzM3MDIxMTk1ODAxMTYyMTUzLkphdmFNYWlsLnJvb3RAdm1zMDc2Lm1haWxzcnZjcy5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":31544,"nextInTopic":31547,"prevInTime":31545,"nextInTime":31547,"topicId":31544,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Awesome!

I find it ironic in some way because i&#39;m sitting here thinking how tonight i felt the need to explain, and justify our choices and our learning experiences to a concerned family member and she ended up talking about some of her experiences as a teacher in a college with studens from all kinds of places.  Basically the real star point that was clear was that we all can continue to grow  and learn throughout our lives and that it isn&#39;t as pat and dry as 12 yrs of this that and the other things in this order and there you go- off to college and collect your &quot;$200&quot;.<br/>\n I was hoping that by my pointing that out she would cease to keep pressuring me about my sons lack of reading skills at his age.  I can only hope she thinks it over more but in the mean-time i wonder if her judging us is your typical human behavior done so as to take the pressure off of ones own issues.<br/>\n~Laura<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pattywithawhy@...\">pattywithawhy@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Date: 2007/11/22 Thu PM 12:23:19 CST<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [AlwaysLearning] my talk with a stranger<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;                  <br/>\n&gt;Thought I&#39;d share this, as it&#39;s that time of year when we see more relatives <br/>\n&gt;and others who tend to get into our business about homeschooling and parenting.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;To support me in helping the orphanages of Baja, Mexico, visit<br/>\n&gt;_Patty&#39;s Corazon de Vida Orphans of Baja Pledge Page_ <br/>\n&gt;(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.active.com/donate/cdvholiday/pattyhunt)\">http://www.active.com/donate/cdvholiday/pattyhunt)</a>  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;**************************************Check out AOL&#39;s list of 2007&#39;s hottest <br/>\n&gt;products.<br/>\n&gt;(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://money.aol.com/special/hot-products-2007?NCID=aoltop00030000000001)\">http://money.aol.com/special/hot-products-2007?NCID=aoltop00030000000001)</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":10665673,"authorName":"pattywithawhy@aol.com","from":"pattywithawhy@...","profile":"pattywithawhy1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"my talk with a stranger","postDate":"1195755799","msgId":31544,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ1Yi4xNGExZWQzYy4zNDc3MjMxN0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":31546,"prevInTime":31543,"nextInTime":31545,"topicId":31544,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thought I d share this, as it s that time of year when we see more relatives and others who tend to get into our business about homeschooling and parenting.

He asked how they were doing in school <br/>\n(to which I replied &quot;great!&quot;) and then he went on to tell me how important <br/>\ngrades were, and how schools aren&#39;t as good as they used to be, and I figured it <br/>\nwasn&#39;t worth it to get into it with the guy, so I just said, couldn&#39;t be more <br/>\npleased with them, they&#39;re doing great, and that seemed to satisfy him.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut then word gets back to him through someone else that they&#39;re <br/>\nhomeschooled.  So then he wants to know how their progress is measured (&quot;I talk to them&quot;) <br/>\nand all that, and I ended up taking the conversation over to him.  He&#39;s <br/>\nretired, and I asked him about what he&#39;s interested in and how he learns.  He ended <br/>\nup telling me all kinds of things about himself, and expressing frustration <br/>\nwith certain things he&#39;s trying to learn and methods he&#39;s using, and comparing <br/>\nhis retirement years with his working years and his school years and how he&#39;s <br/>\nusing his brain less, or at least, differently, I pointed out.  He had concerns <br/>\nthat he wasn&#39;t writing as much as he used to and it bothered him that he was <br/>\nlosing that skill, and I ended up acting as sort of a couselor for him by <br/>\nsuggesting ways he could incorporate more writing into his daily life that might <br/>\nbe enjoyable to him.  He just lit up, he was so delighted with the opportunity <br/>\nto talk about his interests and to find someone to listen to his thoughts.  <br/>\nAnd it made him forget all about his concerns about my kids.  He told me, <br/>\n&quot;You&#39;re a real progressive!&quot;  to which I responded, &quot;Thanks, I&#39;ll take that as a <br/>\ncompliment.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, it was cool, and got my kids off the hook too.<br/>\n <br/>\nPatty<br/>\n <br/>\nTo support me in helping the orphanages of Baja, Mexico, visit<br/>\n_Patty&#39;s Corazon de Vida Orphans of Baja Pledge Page_ <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.active.com/donate/cdvholiday/pattyhunt)\">http://www.active.com/donate/cdvholiday/pattyhunt)</a>  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************************Check out AOL&#39;s list of 2007&#39;s hottest <br/>\nproducts.<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://money.aol.com/special/hot-products-2007?NCID=aoltop00030000000001)\">http://money.aol.com/special/hot-products-2007?NCID=aoltop00030000000001)</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31558,"nextTopicId":31572}}
