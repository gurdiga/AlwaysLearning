OK, here is the email I sent to them:<br/>\n<br/>\nMost reading *disabilities* would disappear if our schools waited to teach reading.  Many children are simply not ready to break the code until much later than our educational system would have us believe.  By then, the damage has been done.  These late-reading children have come to think of themselves as defective and learning disabled.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly within the schools is there any legitimate reason for children to have mastered independent reading.  It is only within our school system that an 8 or 12 year old not-yet-reader is a &quot;problem&quot;.  Young children are wired to learn through hands-on experience, not via books and worksheets.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen children are read to, with pleasure, and spend time around others who read for pleasure and/or information, they will learn to read by the time they are young adults and truly have need to be independent readers.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.childrenofthecode.org/cotcintro.htm\">http://www.childrenofthecode.org/cotcintro.htm</a>  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":144628419,"authorName":"Kelli Traaseth","from":"&quot;Kelli Traaseth&quot; &lt;tktraas@...&gt;","profile":"kellitraas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] about reading/children of the code","postDate":"1072845920","msgId":17750,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMzgwMWMzY2Y1OCRlZTM3YzU5MCRhMjMzMTlhY0B5b3VyZ2c4N3Zxem96cT4=","referencesHeader":"PDExYy4yOWU4NGUzZi4yZDIzMWIyZUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":17758,"prevInTime":17749,"nextInTime":17751,"topicId":17750,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Did you guys see this paragraph?
