It seems to me that the people who feel<br/>\nthat their kids need to be controlled and limited the<br/>\nmost are those who don&#39;t trust their *own* nature...<br/>\nHow can you let your kids stay up as late as they<br/>\nwant, watch as much TV as they want, or choose their<br/>\nown diet if you feel that if *you* were given the<br/>\nfreedom to do those things, everything would fall<br/>\napart?  It seems people regulate themselves more by<br/>\nwhat they think they *should* do, than by what they<br/>\n*want* to do. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to have enough faith in myself, and<br/>\npeople in general to think that left alone to listen<br/>\nto ourselves, everything would work itself out...
