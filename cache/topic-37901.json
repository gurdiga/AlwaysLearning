Her reason was because her daughter was<br/>\nbeing extremely disrespectful to her and so her answer was to punish her<br/>\ndaughter by canceling with us and sending her daughter to her dad&#39;s<br/>\nhouse.

It was a little reminder of why I do what I do<br/>\nand why I live the way I live.<br/>\n<br/>\nChamille and I were talking about the whole thing, and her comment was<br/>\nthat she was glad that her friend still stands up for herself.  She is<br/>\nvery very succinct in what she says, she&#39;s been doing it since she was<br/>\nabout 3, which will say alot about her relationship with her mother.

The difference is that I can let go of my ego and look at it<br/>\nfrom her perspective.

I even told her almost those exact same words above, that<br/>\nI try not to make things worse.  I don&#39;t want to be the one stumbling<br/>\nblock for my daughter.  The worst thing I could do would be to be the<br/>\none that makes the situation worse, who can&#39;t get past my own issues to<br/>\ntreat my daughter like a human being.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be really easy to damage our relationship, but I work to keep<br/>\nit good.

I&#39;m gonna get caller id.&quot; which  <br/>\nmade me laugh. But he is right. Their relationship, their family time  <br/>\nis about now. And if their individual childhoods are good, if their  <br/>\nindividual selves are happy and sated and peaceful much of the time  <br/>\nthey will be more generous and more kind to each other. And maybe  <br/>\nthat will extend<br/>\nbeyond their time within my household. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Holly was seven or eight, she said &quot;Can I hit Marty?&quot; and I said  <br/>\n&quot;When you&#39;re eighteen.&quot;  So for a long time there was commentary and  <br/>\nreference to that.  She would say &quot;I can&#39;t wait until  my 18th  <br/>\nbirthday&quot; when Marty made her mad.  Usually she was joking.  But it  <br/>\nwas a way to express her frustration with him.  And sometimes he  <br/>\nwould do something he knew was irritating and say &quot;I&#39;m not coming to  <br/>\nyour 18th birthday party.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI figure when she turns 18, she will punch Marty on the arm and he&#39;ll  <br/>\ntake it well and laugh and say something funny.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor years Holly would say Kirby was mean and she hated Kirby, and  <br/>\nMarty was her favorite brother.  But the last year Kirby was home,  <br/>\nshe started really liking him.  She was in Rhode Island visiting her  <br/>\nfriend Quinn when Kirby got the job offer in Austin and, over the  <br/>\ncourse of a couple of days,  decided to take it.   When she found out  <br/>\nhe was moving out she cried.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s been to visit him twice in the past year--once Keith and she  <br/>\nand I drove down there, and for my birthday in July what I asked for  <br/>\nfor my gift was two airfares.  One for Kirby to visit here, and one  <br/>\nfor Holly to go to Austin with him at the end of his visit to be  <br/>\nthere for a few days.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be very easy for a 22 year old not to want his 16 year old  <br/>\nsister there at his birthday, but Kirby was happy for  her to go home  <br/>\nwith him and visit.  They like each other.   I think it helped that I  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t try to &quot;make them&quot; like each other.  I tried to give them  <br/>\nprivacy and space and personal attention and understanding.   Of  <br/>\ncourse I&#39;d get frustrated and tired of bickering sometimes, but  <br/>\nbecause the goals of peace and harmony and self-expression were  <br/>\nalways prominent, I didn&#39;t belittle their feelings or deny them or  <br/>\ntry to get them to be false.

I don&#39;t think there is a problem with &quot;addiction&quot; to these games. We had 3 WoW accounts 2 weeks ago, I decided to let go of mine as I didn&#39;t play very much but kept Simon&#39;s and Linnaea&#39;s account going. I probably enjoy playing more than Simon does, but he has a friend for whom WoW is the bees knees. When he comes over it is what he most wants to do. So, with that in mind, I figured I could help Simon get his characters up to higher levels so that he would enjoy playing with his friend more. None of us are addicted. Linnaea plays the most. But she didn&#39;t for a while. She asked me to help her get her main character up a few levels and since she got a riding pet she&#39;s enjoyed playing a lot more. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe on-line Meriam Webster dictionary defines addiction as: compulsive<br/>\nneed for and use of a habit-forming substance (as heroin, nicotine, or<br/>\nalcohol) characterized by tolerance and by well-defined physiological<br/>\nsymptoms upon withdrawal; broadly : persistent compulsive use of a substance known by the user to be harmful<br/>\n<br/>\nBy arguing that video games are addictive you are saying that they produce a complusion. In a household without limits and with 6 game systems no one here has a compulsion to play them. I enjoy some, Simon enjoys some, David enjoys some, Linnaea enjoys some, but none of us are out of control when it comes to video games. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe second point that you have to be arguing is that they are known to be harmful. I have no such evidence. They can produce excitement and imaginative play and conversations and intense focus when in the middle of a serious problem. I think video games are so incredibly intellectually stimulating that I can completely understand the frustration of not solving the puzzle. It is much like a really good debate or an argument or having new ideas that challange all of your old standbys. <br/>\n<br/>\n-------snip-----------<br/>\n Is there any room for &quot;self-discipline&quot; as such?<br/>\n------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what that means. Really. Is it a lonely dominatrix? <br/>\n<br/>\nSelf-discipline must come from yourself, right, and discipline seems to suggest that you would be out of control if you weren&#39;t disciplined. I would let go of the word self-discipline. Personal choice is a much nicer way to look at it. And there is always room for personal choice. <br/>\n<br/>\n-----snip-----------<br/>\n - I&#39;ve read several posts today concerning kids<br/>\nwho &quot;want&quot; to go to school - I have a 14yo who never &#39;said&#39; she wanted<br/>\nto go to school but shows discontent & resentment - I think partly<br/>\nfrom watching things like &quot;High School Musical&quot; & all of the teen<br/>\nshows centered on school like &quot;That&#39;s So Raven&quot; & &quot;Zoe 101&quot;<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know Zoe 101, maybe it hasn&#39;t made it to the UK yet, but That&#39;s So Raven I know quite well. It isn&#39;t school focused at all. And, actually, while High School Musical takes place in a school it is largely about social interactions. It&#39;s very similar to Grease, a show that is so not about school, even if it is set in a school. If there is discontent coming from those sorts of shows I imagine that they are being fueled by a life that is yearning for social relationships, boyfriends. I loved the show Sooner or Later with Rex Smith. I even watched Solid Gold to see more of Rex Smith. It didn&#39;t make me like school more, it didn&#39;t make me want to take guitar lessons or pretend that I was older than I was, it just made me want Rex Smith. Sigh...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------snip----<br/>\n PLUS I&#39;ve<br/>\nhad &#39;well-meaning&#39; friends and family (even DH) expressing concern<br/>\nabout their long-term future (like how will they get work) & &#39;being<br/>\nsocialized&#39; (to which I reply I&#39;m not interested in my children become<br/>\nsocialists or programmed to be worker-bees then I tell them my<br/>\nchildren are very sociable :) <br/>\n---------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s kind of rude, isn&#39;t it? Particularly to your husband. They are legitimate concerns, and concerns that parents have whether their children are in school or not. Dismissing them in such a huge sweeping way isn&#39;t going to help them to understand why you are choosing this route. It is more likely to get them talking to your daughter in private conversations. Not that you need to pander to them, but if they are truly concerned, and, particularly, if your husband, the father of these children, is concerned, it is absolutely worth taking the time to talk to them. <br/>\n<br/>\n------snip-----------<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a resolute unschooler<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is about trusting that learning happens outside of the structure of school. Yes, it is about not schooling, but it is more than that. It is about seeing learning everywhere. It is about recognizing the learning that occurs in a conversation about which word for peeing you prefer when at the gas station (I like urinate or slash) and the learning that occurs while watching the That&#39;s So Raven episode where she meets the other students with psychic power and discovers that being with &quot;her own kind&quot; wasn&#39;t the be all end all. Letting go of school is the first step, and it&#39;s a doozy, but the next steps are about learning how wide you have to spread your arms to get at all the learning that is possible while paying attention to the learning that is going on in the lives in your family. It is incredible to watch the constance of it. Even when it looks like nothing is going on.... It&#39;s like growth spurts, sleeping more, clumsiness, maybe, eating<br/>\n more, more down time and suddenly a huge bit of information synthesized. It isn&#39;t about being anti-school, it is about being pro-learning in all it&#39;s guises. <br/>\n<br/>\n----------snip--------<br/>\n - lol - I do realize that some people are<br/>\nuncomfortable with no &#39;real&#39; schooling even though these very same<br/>\npeople will complain or state how they have to be very involved in<br/>\nschooling & set some teachers straight & the bad habits their kids<br/>\npick up & one hires tutors for their &#39;dyslexic&#39; only child whom they<br/>\nput through expensive programs & kept in summer camps all this past<br/>\nsummer (at least 3 camps) - maybe even jealous that I don&#39;t feel the<br/>\nneed to kowtow to society&#39;s pressure or are so insecure in themselves<br/>\n&/or their children that they leave teaching up to the &#39;experts&#39; -<br/>\nlike I tell them & my children - if public schooling is so great -<br/>\nwhere are all the inventors/geniuses & why are children learning less<br/>\nnow than ever - why do kids from Asia & India come here not even<br/>\nknowing English & within 2 years or so, become the valedictorian of<br/>\nthe graduating class - why do kids graduate h.s. illiterate - why is<br/>\nthere such a variance in achievement - top of the class to barely<br/>\npassing?  so I call it the &#39;public fool system.&#39;<br/>\n---------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a lot of vitrol. I don&#39;t think children are learning less now than ever. In the UK school-children are testing at higher and higher levels. I kowtow to much of society&#39;s pressures, tending only to balk the schooling thing, and actually that isn&#39;t one of society&#39;s pressures. Educating at home is a perfectly valid choice in the society I live in. I&#39;ve informed David, when he was interested in applying for a job in Groningen that The Netherlands isn&#39;t home-ed friendly. He contacted a couple of people who knew more than I did about home-education in The Netherlands and decided that it was a deal breaker, so he didn&#39;t apply. I do think that not using a school structure is outside of the norm. But, everywhere that we&#39;ve lived while home-educating has given me the right to educate my children at home. In the UK there is even precedent in the courts for unschooling, or autonomously educating as it is called here. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of inventors. Lots and lots of inventors. I can&#39;t even begin. Video games and the leaps and bounds those have made, have you seen a movie from Pixar? The amazing technological advancements in animation and in programming. Look at special effects...  Heart valves. Flexible solar panels. Facebook. David is on a list for Mazda Bongo owners. Mazda Bongos don&#39;t have very good temperature gauges. When we were in Australia he noticed an alarm for cars as they reached nearly over-heating and mentioned it on the list. One of the other guys on the list got in touch with an Australian company and got them to design an alarm for the Mazda Bongo. A new invention. Or at least a new modification of an already existing device.I noticed in a Scientific American an article on a kinetic power source from walking being used to power mobile devices: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=powering-cell-phone-battery.\">http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=powering-cell-phone-battery.</a> Do a google search for the TED talks. Look at<br/>\n the recent Nobel Prize winners. I&#39;ve got Oliver Smithies (who reminds me of Ed Wynn) talking in the background while I write. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you are writing isn&#39;t true. There are inventors, there are geniuses, there are non-Asian valedictorians. And yes there is a huge range of ability within schools. There are failures and there are successes within a system that is defining itself on grades. And that is a huge problem with schools and with those who leave schools. The variance has more to do with the fact that schools are working to fit all children into a small box of understanding how learning happens and what smart means. I watch a show called QI quite regularly. It&#39;s a game show hosted by Stephen Fry that is about Quite Interesting (QI) facts and which examines the &quot;facts&quot; that everyone knows are true, but that aren&#39;t actually true. The other night the question was what was invented in Cambridge in 1792. The answer was examinations: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/commentandanalysis/3612018.Scrap_exams_and_get_on_with_teaching/\">http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/commentandanalysis/3612018.Scrap_exams_and_get_on_with_teaching/</a> is an article that mentions that. The author of that<br/>\n article states that examinations have been around in China for at least 4000 years. So, QI got it wrong. Assessment is an important tool when you are trying to order individuals. It doesn&#39;t align itself with unschooling. Nor is it meaningful when all individuals aren&#39;t heading for the same place. In 1792 Cambridge I imagine there were fairly few students. I find the number 150 freshmen in 1800. So not a lot of students being assessed for the jobs of research at universities. And probably being an upperclass twit, or an educated member of the royal family. In 2008 the number of people being assessed as able to fill academic niches is too great for the number of academic niches available. <br/>\n<br/>\n------snip--------<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about I have 5 kids & the stress & arguing & crying (esp my 5yo<br/>\nDS) they do over playing games & not being able to play (the older<br/>\nkids dominating the computers) - even when I allow them &#39;free reign&#39;<br/>\nthe older ones will not usually &#39;take turns?&#39; - all of my children<br/>\nhave pretty much unlimited access to the internet - but I, also, get<br/>\nfrustrated when chores go undone & calls for them go unheeded due to<br/>\nthe extreme wrapping up in the game (Maple Story, currently - but<br/>\nthere was Runescape & Neopets & Gaia & Tektek) They are, also, pretty<br/>\nwrapped up in youtube & myspace (14yo)  BTW - now 3 (14yo DD, 11yo DS<br/>\n8yo DD) of my kids have their own computer set up - only my 5yo DS &<br/>\n2yo DD don&#39;t - but my 5yo wants to play all the time too<br/>\n-------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen someone wants something someone else is using in our house I tend to work to engage the person who is waiting. Finding other engagement is easy, there are lots of things to do in or out of the house. Depending on the weather and the waiter there are lots of ways to become engaged. If things are getting stressful or into arguing I try to be as present as possible. I sit and help and listen and offer options and listen and wait and hold and be. My presence makes a big difference to the outcome of their rising tension. The hardest thing is for the waiter to walk away from the wait. At least in my experience. But my life is such that I can sit and be and wait and help as needed, as wanted. I also try and be aware of other things that my be leading up to this eruption of tension. Hunger, thirst, or tiredness and I try and make sure that those issues are taken care of often. Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs<br/>\n (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs)\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs)</a> flashes through my head when I am trying to help. <br/>\n<br/>\n---------snip-----------<br/>\nIs there no concern about them playing & interacting together & all of<br/>\nus as a family?<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------<br/>\nI almost never see my brother. The last time was 3 years ago. I haven&#39;t talked to him in a year maybe. There isn&#39;t any meanness or avoidance, really, in it. But there is also no connection. I know he reads my blog and I think of him often and e-mail him occassionally. We played and interacted as children and we fought and he&#39;s 5 years older than I am and we&#39;ve gone down very different paths. My children are much closer than Sam and I were. But I have no expectation that they will get along at any given moment. The other day Linnaea was spitting at Simon, sort of playfully, and he said &quot;You know, when I grow up I may not talk to you ever. I&#39;m gonna get caller id.&quot; which made me laugh. But he is right. Their relationship, their family time is about now. And if their individual childhoods are good, if their individual selves are happy and sated and peaceful much of the time they will be more generous and more kind to each other. And maybe that will extend<br/>\n beyond their time within my household. <br/>\n<br/>\n--------snip----------<br/>\n - I know some will say - play with them<br/>\n---------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nAbsolutely, play with them, watch with them, dance the dances they find on youtube with them. Without that what are you doing? Playing with them is key. Really key. <br/>\n<br/>\n------------snip------------<br/>\n I have so much to do that it&#39;s hard for<br/>\nme to justify that <br/>\n-------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nJustify what? Playing with your children? Enagaging with them where they are so that you can be fired up about what they are doing and learning and so that you can find new engaging things for them? That&#39;s really important stuff. There should be no need to justify that. <br/>\n<br/>\n--------snip-------------<br/>\nso, I suppose<br/>\nI&#39;m struggling between the constant, untiring gaming (is this more<br/>\npronounced because I&#39;m sometimes adamant against playing so freakin&#39;<br/>\nmuch!), the lack of rest, the radiation from the computer & monitor,<br/>\nthe physical inactivity, the apparent obsession, etc, & wanting them<br/>\nto do more &#39;organic&#39; things like play outside, create, draw, play<br/>\nmusic, read? <br/>\n--------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nJeez, what a lot of fear, and when you lay it out like that it must be really hard to see any value in their &quot;untiring gaming&quot;. You mentioned youtube, that&#39;s a lot of music to be playing, there is a lot of creation in games, and drawing, Art Rage is fantastic for drawing. Between Simon and Linnaea,  Simon is less likely to play outside, but when he does choose to, because it is a choice, he goes wholeheartedly. Forcing him to do something means that the something is unpleasant. Even if I think it is absolutely pleasant. Because it is his choice he will come up with things to do outside on his own. Things like going fishing or going to the beach to jump down the dunes. Linnaea plays outside a lot. She loves to talk on the phone while walking around the house. She likes to hike out across the fields with the cats following her to look at the horses down the way. They are different in what they enjoy. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, Linnaea really wants to play on WoW, so I&#39;m going to give her the computer. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Maple Story, Runescape, online interactive  RPGs + background info","postDate":"1220602583","msgId":37921,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDcxOTYzQzY2LTc0NUYtNDlCRi05QjQ2LUI0NTFENjE2RjZFNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGc5cTMyNStqZTQ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGc5cTMyNStqZTQ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":37920,"nextInTopic":37922,"prevInTime":37920,"nextInTime":37922,"topicId":37901,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

That&#39;s not because there  <br/>\naren&#39;t people who probably think we&#39;re more than a little nuts.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne time another woman described to me how her husband critiqued her  <br/>\ncooking pretty much every night. She put a full dinner on the table at  <br/>\n6 pm every night. He walked in the door from work, on schedule, sat  <br/>\ndown to eat. At the end of dinner he&#39;d say things like, &quot;I&#39;d rather  <br/>\nnot have that again, it wasn&#39;t that good.&quot; Sometimes he&#39;d say, &quot;Next  <br/>\ntime, use less cheese.&quot; &quot;Needs more salt.&quot; Stuff like that. Then he&#39;d  <br/>\nget up, go to their bedroom room and watch tv while she cleaned up and  <br/>\ntook care of the children.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were sitting at my dining room table while she told me this. I was  <br/>\ndumbfounded. She asked me what I did when my husband criticized my  <br/>\ncooking. I sputtered - &quot;Umm, well, gee, he wouldn&#39;t DARE because, if  <br/>\nhe did that to me, I&#39;d stop cooking.&quot; Which isn&#39;t to say I never cook  <br/>\nanything that turns out bad. I am kind of an experimental cook and  <br/>\nsometimes my experiments are pretty awful. When that happens, we all  <br/>\neat a bit, and I&#39;ll usually say, &quot;Okay, okay - I won&#39;t be repeating  <br/>\nthis one. Anybody want me to stick some frozen pizza in the oven?&quot; We  <br/>\nlaugh. It is all okay. Truth is, my husband almost always thanks me  <br/>\nand says something nice about the food whenever I cook for him - so do  <br/>\nthe kids, usually. I can tell how much they like something by whether  <br/>\nthey say, &quot;We should have this again.&quot; And, I thank my husband when he  <br/>\ncooks, too!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - how is that related to nobody criticizing my parenting choices? I  <br/>\nam not open to it. I talk very matter-of-factly about our different  <br/>\nparenting styles and choices when I&#39;m with one of my sisters, who is  <br/>\nvery conventional. She&#39;s a really good mom in the conventional sense -  <br/>\nloves her kids, shows it, supports them. I don&#39;t ever argue with her -  <br/>\nI show total respect for her choices and make it clear that I&#39;m  <br/>\nabsolutely not interested in critiquing her parenting. But, with a  <br/>\ntwinkle in my eyes, I respond to her mention of chore charts with,  <br/>\n&quot;Well, you know how I am - no chore charts in our house.&quot; I sort of  <br/>\nlet the other person know that I know that they think we&#39;re kind of  <br/>\nbizarre and that I&#39;m okay with them thinking that. It really and truly  <br/>\ndoes not bother me at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that&#39;s the key to why we never get into any kind of debate -  <br/>\nI&#39;m not trying to convince them that unschooling is a good idea. I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t care what they think. I don&#39;t want to argue, so if something  <br/>\nsounds like it could be interpreted as a criticism, I choose to  <br/>\nunderstand it as just a comment made without malice and I respond with  <br/>\nsomething lighthearted or maybe even a bit of pointed humor.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I&#39;m guessing, people also know that if they were openly and  <br/>\nrudely critical, I&#39;d be able to defend myself quite strongly, so they  <br/>\navoid it by keeping their negative thoughts to themselves, which is  <br/>\nfine with me. My sister and I love each other and each other&#39;s kids.  <br/>\nWe both take a sort of slightly-amused-at-the-differences perspective.  <br/>\nAnd we&#39;re both happy that all of our kids have grown up to be very  <br/>\ncool young adults.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Maple Story, Runescape, online interactive  RPGs + background info","postDate":"1220585408","msgId":37920,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDNURCNUJBLTFDQjktNEMwOS05NDJBLTZERENCNUJEMDIyOEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGc5cTMyNStqZTQ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGc5cTMyNStqZTQ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":37919,"nextInTopic":37921,"prevInTime":37919,"nextInTime":37921,"topicId":37901,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I guess I wish to create the most natural environment possible & I feel that gaming & TV (which both consist of programming )-=- Don t let a word get","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-36488306\">-=-I guess I wish to create the most natural environment possible & I<br/>\nfeel that gaming & TV (which both consist of &#39;programming&#39;)-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t let a word get between you and your direct perceptions.

What I see in my own house is that my younger<br/>\nkid, 7, really wants to do whatever my older kid, 14, is doing.  It has<br/>\nless to do with the activity at hand and more to do with seeing that<br/>\nsomething might be interesting and wanting to explore it.  While, I do<br/>\nunderstand that my younger kid wants and likes to do computer stuff and<br/>\nvideo game stuff, the draw isn&#39;t nearly the same as it is for my older<br/>\nkid.

I want the time they DO spend<br/>\ntogether to be fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nSort of related but not, the other day both my girls were playing Gaia<br/>\nand Margaux, 7, was following her sister&#39;s avatar around everywhere. <br/>\nChamille was being gracious about it, even though she was clearly trying<br/>\nto chat with people.  Margaux never does anything halfway, and<br/>\neventually she was trying to join the conversations too.  She started<br/>\ndoing the repetetive words or numbers or letters thing.  Some of<br/>\nChamille&#39;s friends were getting mad about it, even though Chamille had<br/>\ntold them all that Margaux was a little kid and couldn&#39;t read or spell<br/>\nstuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally Chamille gets all annoyed and says very loudly &quot;Margaux stop!&quot;. <br/>\nI was listening in to all of this happening, just kind of seeing how it<br/>\nwould play out.  I looked at Chamille and said, &quot;Hey she&#39;s taking a page<br/>\nout of your book.&quot;, since Chamille used to do that ALL the time on chat<br/>\nforums, just to irritate certain people.  She started laughing and<br/>\nlaughing, so hard she was rolling on the floor.  Then we talked to<br/>\nMargaux about netiquette and how it&#39;s fun to an extent, but it does get<br/>\nold and it can irritate people, people that Chamille would like to keep<br/>\nas friends.  Then I told Margaux that Chamille would help her know and<br/>\nnavigate netiquette a little, and that if Chamille told her enough was<br/>\nenough, that she really should listen.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point of the story is that both my kids have unlimited access to<br/>\nplay what they want, when they want.  Chamille is gracious about her<br/>\nsister being online with her and Margaux is willing to cease being &quot;the<br/>\nannoying little sister&quot; because she trusts her older sister and wants to<br/>\nbe in her good graces.  One thing that really really helped get them to<br/>\nthis point is for me to make sure that they aren&#39;t interfering with each<br/>\nother in negative ways.  One way to do that is to take one of them and<br/>\ndo something individual while the other can have peace to do what they<br/>\nneed to do.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Maple Story, Runescape, online interactive  RPGs + background info","postDate":"1220547588","msgId":37915,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM1NTgzMzYyLThDMkYtNDYyRC1BRjZCLUJFRjRDNTA5MDA4NUBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGc5b3EyditqdWYwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGc5b3EyditqdWYwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":37914,"nextInTopic":37916,"prevInTime":37914,"nextInTime":37916,"topicId":37901,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

One  <br/>\nof the worst things about school is that children don&#39;t choose to be  <br/>\nthere, the decision is made for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m guessing if your daughter shows discontent and resentment, that  <br/>\nit could be because of the negativity at home, the disapproval, and  <br/>\nthe chores.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a family defines school as the devil (in any way), then it will be  <br/>\neasy for them to be complacent and figure that anything they do at  <br/>\nhome is better than the evil school.    That&#39;s one problem.  The  <br/>\nother is that if for ANY reason the kids end up in school, they&#39;ll  <br/>\nstart off scared to death, and if they discover they kinda like it,  <br/>\ntheir faith in the parents&#39; opinions goes down.  If they don&#39;t trust  <br/>\nyour opinion about one thing, they&#39;ll be less likely to accept your  <br/>\nopinion about another thing.  So, for example, if you tell them the  <br/>\nradiation from a computer screen will harm them, and they see you  <br/>\nsitting in front of a computer, being &quot;old&quot; (to them) and alive, and  <br/>\nthey know even older people who work with computers at work and  <br/>\naren&#39;t dead, will they believe your advice about sexually transmitted  <br/>\ndiseases or pregnancy?

Is there any room for &quot;self-discipline&quot; as such?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I suppose some people could be addicted to video games just like <br/>\nothers are addicted to gambling or shopping.  Those things are not <br/>\ninherently addictive, but some people might be prone to addictive <br/>\nbehavior.  Restricting one type of activity for fear it can be <br/>\naddictive is senseless because a person prone to addictive behavior <br/>\nwill simply find another addiction.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I believe in my childrens&#39; native intelligence - but I sometimes<br/>\n&gt; need the support that I&#39;m okay & they&#39;re okay - it&#39;s hard, when<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re ingrained with &#39;you have to do something productive&#39; to<br/>\n&gt; think that playing RPGs non-stop all day & night until the wee<br/>\n&gt; hours of the morning is &quot;normal&quot; ...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Repeat that thought but put different activities in the place of <br/>\nRPGs.  What if your child read books, worked on puzzles, watch <br/>\ntelevision, walked outside, worked in the garden, etc. many hours of <br/>\nthe day and night?  Would you feel equally concerned about how they <br/>\nspend their time?  Or do you put more value on some activities than <br/>\nothers?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - granted - I&#39;m a night owl - so is the family entire - early<br/>\n&gt; for us is 9am - hardly anyone wakes up before then (8:30 at the<br/>\n&gt; earliest) my 14yo can easily sleep until 11 or 12 noon<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re admitting all of you like to stay up late.  What do you do <br/>\nwith your time with the kid(s) play video games?  Again, are you <br/>\nplacing more value on some activities over others?  What would you <br/>\nlike to see your children doing instead of playing the video games?<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; However, I have seen grown men (25yo+) &#39;neglect&#39; their families to<br/>\n&gt; play video games...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That is not the fault of the video games themselves.  That is <br/>\nsomething going on inside the person&#39;s mind, and if video games <br/>\naren&#39;t around, he would likely find another activity.  I&#39;ve heard of <br/>\nmen spending hours on the golf course, boating on the lake, working <br/>\nin the yard, etc.  Would you consider those things to be addictive as <br/>\nwell?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; why does it seem some people don&#39;t &#39;grow out of it?&#39; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So video games are only for children?  They are a pleasant way to <br/>\nspend time.  I myself spend hours playing an online game, but I&#39;m not <br/>\naddicted and/or neglecting my family.  I don&#39;t feel there is anything <br/>\nelse adult I should be doing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI can also talk about my husband who spends hours working on his <br/>\nonline Diplomacy games.  Both his gaming interests and mine are <br/>\nactually quite brain challenging.  They aren&#39;t mindless, worthless <br/>\nactivities.  We enjoy the problem solving as well as the social <br/>\ninteraction of playing the games with other people.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I did my share of fighting over game time (5 of us) but mostly <br/>\n&gt; decided it was sort of a waste of time & read books or did crafts<br/>\n&gt; instead.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ah.  There&#39;s the answer.  You place no value on the activity because <br/>\nyou don&#39;t care for the activity personally.  Therefore, how can <br/>\nanyone else place a high value on these activities?<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How about I have 5 kids & the stress & arguing & crying (esp my 5yo<br/>\n&gt; DS) they do over playing games & not being able to play (the older<br/>\n&gt; kids dominating the computers) - even when I allow them &#39;free reign&#39;<br/>\n&gt; the older ones will not usually &#39;take turns?&#39; - <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There isn&#39;t enough to go around then.  It&#39;s like offering a plate of <br/>\n4 cookies to a dozen children and expecting them to share.  What if <br/>\nyou only had one bicycle for them to ride?  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy children don&#39;t fight over computer time because everyone has their <br/>\nown computer.  No one feels shorted or left out.  The computers are <br/>\njust another thing to do along with all the other stuff they have to <br/>\ndo.  They know it&#39;s there when they want it so they don&#39;t feel a need <br/>\nto gorge themselves on it in fear that it will be taken away soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I, also, get frustrated when chores go undone & calls for them go <br/>\n&gt; unheeded due to the extreme wrapping up in the game<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No one in my family has chores, not even me.  We all do what we can <br/>\nto help when we&#39;re able to do so.  I would get very upset if my <br/>\nhusband told me to stop playing my game in the middle of something <br/>\nbig happening to tell me to do laundry.  He feels the same way when <br/>\nhe&#39;s involved in something.  And again, the activity doesn&#39;t matter.  <br/>\nIt can be gaming, gardening, reading, or whatever.  All activities <br/>\nhave value to the person doing them voluntarily, whether you feel the <br/>\nsame way or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; so, I suppose I&#39;m struggling between the constant, untiring gaming<br/>\n&gt; (is this more pronounced because I&#39;m sometimes adamant against<br/>\n&gt; playing so freakin&#39; much!), the lack of rest, the radiation from<br/>\n&gt; the computer & monitor, the physical inactivity, the apparent<br/>\n&gt; obsession, etc, & wanting them to do more &#39;organic&#39; things like<br/>\n&gt; play outside, create, draw, play music, read?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You also said you were too busy to justify your time spent playing <br/>\nthe video games.  I&#39;m guessing you personally don&#39;t like the games <br/>\nand want to see your children doing things you yourself would like to <br/>\ndo.  BTW, there is no physical activity in reading, drawing or even <br/>\nplaying music (like piano or violin).  If they spent hours doing <br/>\nthose things and sitting in one place, would you feel better?<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Maple Story, Runescape, online interactive  RPGs + background info","postDate":"1220536693","msgId":37905,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQyOTE4NUI5LUUzQjUtNDUzOS1BNUQ1LTAwMjE4MDMwQTZDRUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGc5b2JmdSs1bjlyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGc5b2JmdSs1bjlyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":37903,"nextInTopic":37906,"prevInTime":37904,"nextInTime":37906,"topicId":37901,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Does anyone think that there is a problem with addiction to these games?-=- Sure, LOTS of people do!

I don&#39;t think  <br/>\nkids want to hurt each other, but if someone is in the way of what  <br/>\nthey want it takes some heavy duty social skills to figure out how to  <br/>\nget it in ways that are respectful.

Try recasting it as something else. What if they  <br/>\nwere as engaged in something you valued?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut why should your judgement of what should be valued be important  <br/>\nin how they choose to spend their time?

But she also finds it hard to stop talking to her  <br/>\nfriends late at night because that&#39;s when they&#39;re available.

It is advisable, therefore, that x-<br/>\n &gt; radiation from TV sets, as well as other commonly used electronic<br/>\n &gt; products, be kept as low as reasonably achievable. It was for this<br/>\n &gt; purpose that Congress enacted the Radiation Control for Health and<br/>\n &gt; Safety Act of 1968 (currently called Federal Food, Drug, and<br/>\n &gt; Cosmetic Act â Subchapter C â Electronic Product Radiation Control).<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; It should be emphasized that most TV sets have not been found to<br/>\n &gt; give off any measurable level of radiation, and there is no<br/>\n &gt; evidence that radiation from TV sets has resulted in human injury.<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; Setting a Radiation Safety Standard<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has the responsibility for<br/>\n &gt; carrying out an electronic product radiation control program<br/>\n &gt; mandated by the Electronic Product Radiation Control provisions of<br/>\n &gt; the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. Through it&#39;s Center for Devices and<br/>\n &gt; Radiological Health, FDA sets and enforces standards of performance<br/>\n &gt; for electronic products to assure that radiation emissions do not<br/>\n &gt; pose a hazard to public health.<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; A Federal standard limiting x-ray emissions from TV receivers to<br/>\n &gt; 0.5 milliroentgen per hour (mR/hr) was issued on December 25, 1969.<br/>\n &gt; The standard is applicable to all TV sets manufactured after<br/>\n &gt; January 15, 1970. The overall effect of the standard is to require<br/>\n &gt; that TV receivers must not emit x-radiation above the 0.5 mR/hr<br/>\n &gt; level when tested under adverse operating conditions. Test<br/>\n &gt; conditions do not represent normal use and ensure that when used<br/>\n &gt; under normal conditions, TV sets do not pose a radiation hazard.<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; Assuring That TV Sets Meet the Radiation Standard<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; Manufacturers of television receivers and computer monitors contain<br/>\n &gt; CRTs must certify that their products meets performance standard<br/>\n &gt; under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part<br/>\n &gt; 1020.10. All TV manufacturers must submit written radiation safety<br/>\n &gt; reports to FDA outlining how they assure that each set coming off<br/>\n &gt; the assembly line complies with the Federal x-ray radiation limit.<br/>\n &gt; These reports contain a description of the manufacturerâs quality<br/>\n &gt; control and testing program and the television radiation safety<br/>\n &gt; design. Manufacturers also must maintain records of test data and<br/>\n &gt; prepare an annual report to FDA summarizing these records. The FDA<br/>\n &gt; has the authority to ask for radiation safety data including<br/>\n &gt; results of x-ray leakage from selected sets to determine compliance<br/>\n &gt; with the standard.<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; Television receivers imported into the United States, which do not<br/>\n &gt; meet the standard are not allowed into the country and are<br/>\n &gt; destroyed if not exported in 90 days. Importers, however, may<br/>\n &gt; petition FDA for permission to correct the violations.<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; How Safe Are TV Sets Today?<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; X-radiation emissions from properly operated TV sets and computer<br/>\n &gt; monitors containing CRTs are well controlled and do not present a<br/>\n &gt; public health hazard. The FDA standard, and todayâs technology,<br/>\n &gt; such as electronic hold-down safety circuits and regulated power<br/>\n &gt; supplies, have effectively eliminated the risk of x-radiation from<br/>\n &gt; these products. FDA has not found TVs that violate the standard<br/>\n &gt; under normal (home) use conditions.<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; It is important to note also that flat panel TVs incorporating<br/>\n &gt; Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD) or Plasma displays are not capable of<br/>\n &gt; emitting x-radiation. As such these products and are not subject to<br/>\n &gt; the FDA standard and do not pose a public health hazard.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Joyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":213284539,"authorName":"firstgoddessfirst","from":"&quot;firstgoddessfirst&quot; &lt;firstgoddess@...&gt;","profile":"firstgoddessfirst","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Maple Story, Runescape, online interactive  RPGs + background info","postDate":"1220522302","msgId":37901,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGc5b2JmdSs1bjlyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":37903,"prevInTime":37900,"nextInTime":37902,"topicId":37901,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi All, Here s the question: Does anyone think that there is a problem with addiction to these games?

Is there any room for &quot;self-discipline&quot; as such?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said - for some background - I&#39;m a resolute unschooler - I<br/>\ndon&#39;t believe in keeping your kids out of an environment only to<br/>\nreproduce it at home - I&#39;ve read several posts today concerning kids<br/>\nwho &quot;want&quot; to go to school - I have a 14yo who never &#39;said&#39; she wanted<br/>\nto go to school but shows discontent & resentment - I think partly<br/>\nfrom watching things like &quot;High School Musical&quot; & all of the teen<br/>\nshows centered on school like &quot;That&#39;s So Raven&quot; & &quot;Zoe 101&quot; PLUS I&#39;ve<br/>\nhad &#39;well-meaning&#39; friends and family (even DH) expressing concern<br/>\nabout their long-term future (like how will they get work) & &#39;being<br/>\nsocialized&#39; (to which I reply I&#39;m not interested in my children become<br/>\nsocialists or programmed to be worker-bees then I tell them my<br/>\nchildren are very sociable :)  But I think in private conversations<br/>\nwith my daughter they try to sway her with all she&#39;s &#39;missing&#39; -<br/>\nAlthough I do believe she would do well in school, as such, as she has<br/>\na competitive spirit - I did read a lot of responses about having a<br/>\nrich & varied social life - I&#39;m working on that - right now she&#39;s<br/>\ngetting it via church - lol - I do realize that some people are<br/>\nuncomfortable with no &#39;real&#39; schooling even though these very same<br/>\npeople will complain or state how they have to be very involved in<br/>\nschooling & set some teachers straight & the bad habits their kids<br/>\npick up & one hires tutors for their &#39;dyslexic&#39; only child whom they<br/>\nput through expensive programs & kept in summer camps all this past<br/>\nsummer (at least 3 camps) - maybe even jealous that I don&#39;t feel the<br/>\nneed to kowtow to society&#39;s pressure or are so insecure in themselves<br/>\n&/or their children that they leave teaching up to the &#39;experts&#39; -<br/>\nlike I tell them & my children - if public schooling is so great -<br/>\nwhere are all the inventors/geniuses & why are children learning less<br/>\nnow than ever - why do kids from Asia & India come here not even<br/>\nknowing English & within 2 years or so, become the valedictorian of<br/>\nthe graduating class - why do kids graduate h.s. illiterate - why is<br/>\nthere such a variance in achievement - top of the class to barely<br/>\npassing?  so I call it the &#39;public fool system.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nI had one friend tell me that because my husband & I were so &#39;smart&#39;<br/>\nthat she knew all of our children would be geniuses even if we never<br/>\ntaught them a lesson - apparently, pressure got to her later, as she<br/>\nenrolled her children in online school (Calvert, I believe) & STRONGLY<br/>\nsuggested I do the same - I even let her test my oldest - which came<br/>\nout favorably - for never having one formal lesson she scored very<br/>\nwell - but this same friend had her children doing hours of lessons<br/>\nevery day since like 6yo & still has little or no faith in her<br/>\nchildrens&#39; intelligence, her oldest teenage boy, 16 or 17, she&#39;s<br/>\nalready &#39;written off&#39; as being &#39;just a mechanic,&#39; because he&#39;s not the<br/>\n&#39;intellectual&#39; she is.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe in my childrens&#39; native intelligence - but I sometimes need<br/>\nthe support that I&#39;m okay & they&#39;re okay - it&#39;s hard, when you&#39;re<br/>\ningrained with &#39;you have to do something productive&#39; to think that<br/>\nplaying RPGs non-stop all day & night until the wee hours of the<br/>\nmorning is &quot;normal&quot; - granted - I&#39;m a night owl - so is the family<br/>\nentire - early for us is 9am - hardly anyone wakes up before then<br/>\n(8:30 at the earliest) my 14yo can easily sleep until 11 or 12 noon<br/>\n<br/>\nI &#39;let&#39; my children go to church, although I don&#39;t go at all & I<br/>\nbelieve this is just another conditioning (like the &quot;Four Agreements&quot;<br/>\nby Don Miguel Ruiz, which I highly recommend) & I raise my kids to be<br/>\nfree-thinkers - unprogrammed - allowed to let their brains think &<br/>\nlearn the way that&#39;s natural to them - a Baptist church group has a<br/>\n&quot;bus kids&quot; program that picks up all these kids & my 2 daughters were<br/>\nfirst lured there by a pizza party - then liked the social aspect -<br/>\ngot &quot;saved&quot; - now my daughters want me to go to elevate them from &quot;bus<br/>\nkids&quot; status - lol - I was raised Jehovah&#39;s Witness - so this goes<br/>\ntotally against my own indoctrination/training/conditioning haha<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve read a bit about the video games & respect & it&#39;s altered my<br/>\nthinking somewhat - although I was coming to this conclusion -<br/>\nHowever, I have seen grown men (25yo+) &#39;neglect&#39; their families to<br/>\nplay video games - although some do sit with their children while<br/>\nplaying - my concern is - why does it seem some people don&#39;t &#39;grow out<br/>\nof it?&#39;  My dad was a Radio Shack aficionado so we had the very first<br/>\nvideos games - like Pong & Tandy tape recorder games & I did my share<br/>\nof fighting over game time (5 of us) but mostly decided it was sort of<br/>\na waste of time & read books or did crafts instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about I have 5 kids & the stress & arguing & crying (esp my 5yo<br/>\nDS) they do over playing games & not being able to play (the older<br/>\nkids dominating the computers) - even when I allow them &#39;free reign&#39;<br/>\nthe older ones will not usually &#39;take turns?&#39; - all of my children<br/>\nhave pretty much unlimited access to the internet - but I, also, get<br/>\nfrustrated when chores go undone & calls for them go unheeded due to<br/>\nthe extreme wrapping up in the game (Maple Story, currently - but<br/>\nthere was Runescape & Neopets & Gaia & Tektek) They are, also, pretty<br/>\nwrapped up in youtube & myspace (14yo)  BTW - now 3 (14yo DD, 11yo DS<br/>\n8yo DD) of my kids have their own computer set up - only my 5yo DS &<br/>\n2yo DD don&#39;t - but my 5yo wants to play all the time too<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there no concern about them playing & interacting together & all of<br/>\nus as a family? - I know some will say - play with them - I&#39;ve done<br/>\nthat before on Neopets - I used to play as one of my kids&#39; accounts -<br/>\nusually whoever was logged in at the time - play games & win them<br/>\npoints & sometimes trophies - I have so much to do that it&#39;s hard for<br/>\nme to justify that - my kids will all play Maple Story at the same<br/>\ntime - so I&#39;m guessing they&#39;re interacting that way - so, I suppose<br/>\nI&#39;m struggling between the constant, untiring gaming (is this more<br/>\npronounced because I&#39;m sometimes adamant against playing so freakin&#39;<br/>\nmuch!), the lack of rest, the radiation from the computer & monitor,<br/>\nthe physical inactivity, the apparent obsession, etc, & wanting them<br/>\nto do more &#39;organic&#39; things like play outside, create, draw, play<br/>\nmusic, read?  My son basically taught himself to read via Runescape &<br/>\nmy 8yo is like someone else&#39;s DD was/is on this list who goes around<br/>\nsaying she can&#39;t read yet (my 2 oldest taught themselves to read at<br/>\n8yo - she&#39;ll be 9 in October)- so I&#39;m showing her that she actually<br/>\nCAN read & just has to relax & let it happen - my 5yo can put in his<br/>\nusername, password AND pin for Maple Story - so I don&#39;t think RPG are<br/>\nALL bad - just all-consuming.<br/>\n<br/>\nAimee<br/>\n<br/>\nThanx for reading - lol<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. I addressed the background & other info to sorta pre-answer<br/>\nquestions that I saw as likely to crop up as in other threads.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38009,"nextTopicId":38067}}
