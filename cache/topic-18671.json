Yes, for now. Banish ALL school-think now. Every bit of it.<br/>\nYou <br/>\nneed to DEschool FIRST, then you can start looking at some &quot;schooly&quot;<br/>\nthings as <br/>\nOK. More experienced unschoolers: ignore my school-speak.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause you&#39;re looking at things in a &quot;schooly&quot; way, I want you to do<br/>\nthis <br/>\nfor me. You&#39;ve just been enrolled in &quot;The Church of John Holt School&quot;.<br/>\nThe <br/>\nheadmistress/guru is Sandra Dodd (it&#39;s her list, after all). Your<br/>\n&quot;teachers&quot; are <br/>\nall the experienced posters on this e-list (It&#39;s an internet based<br/>\nschool.). <br/>\nThey each have different &quot;specalties, but they all &quot;get it&quot;, so we&#39;re<br/>\nall on the <br/>\nsame page.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce is our voice of reason--she has a brilliant way of breaking things<br/>\ndown <br/>\nfor beginners and her anaolgies are spot-on! <br/>\npam (little p) is our math wiz, who will make sure you know that you are<br/>\n<br/>\nsurrounded by math daily and how best to *see* it. <br/>\nDeb L can get a little loud about rights of children, so she&#39;s our<br/>\nchildren&#39;s <br/>\nadvocate; she&#39;s also my comic relief. <br/>\nRen is our &quot;spiritual leader&quot; and a perfect example of someone who<br/>\nstruggled <br/>\nto get here (her whole, strange trip is available in the archives of <br/>\nunschooling.com boards) . <br/>\nKathryn&#39;s our new unschooling conference coordinator, enabling you to<br/>\nmeet <br/>\nall these fine folks IRL. <br/>\nPam H had understood unschooling before her oldest could even walk!<br/>\nMary (Zenmomma) understands kids who are &quot;labeled&quot; and can move you away<br/>\nfrom <br/>\nlabels quickly.<br/>\nMy husband last night called me the &quot;Billy Graham of UNschooling&quot;. I am<br/>\nthe <br/>\nevangelist---I scream the loudest!  And I want to convert you! &lt;BWG&gt;. <br/>\n<br/>\nOthers of you &quot;teachers&quot;, please write in and tell me your<br/>\nspecialties----I&#39;m <br/>\nbusy typing, and although I don&#39;t want to exclude anyone, I&#39;m on a <br/>\nrollllllll.....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut right now, you&#39;re in UNschooling kindergarten. We want you to <br/>\nPLAY----just like in &quot;old-time kindergarten&quot;. We need for you to<br/>\nunderstand that PLAYING <br/>\nis LEARNING. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the first &quot;rule&quot; of unschooling. PLAY!<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond rule. Everything counts. Everything you learn----on purpose or <br/>\naccidentally----counts. You WILL eventually make a connection with that<br/>\ntiny bit of <br/>\ninformation you discovered yesterday. Give it time. Connect the dots.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird Rule. You will only remember what is important to Y-O-U! And that<br/>\ncan <br/>\nchange over time. The best way to learn things is through immersion IN<br/>\nthose <br/>\nthings. Passions.<br/>\n<br/>\nRule four. ALL things are connected. ALL THINGS! You know the &quot;Seven<br/>\nDegrees <br/>\nof Separation of Kevin Bacon? I promise that there are fewer than seven <br/>\ndegrees between all things in the universe. Try us! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nRule five. There is NO division in UNschooling. Now before pam (little<br/>\np) <br/>\nchimes in with 6/3, let me clarify. We do NOT divide the world into<br/>\n&quot;subjects&quot;. <br/>\nMath is art is science is history is music is literature. It&#39;s all<br/>\nrelated and <br/>\ninter-related. YOUR school makes these divisions; The Church of John<br/>\nHolt <br/>\nSchool does not.<br/>\n<br/>\nRule six. Well-roundedness is over-rated. At the same time, by immersing<br/>\n<br/>\nyourself into a passion, you automatically cover all the &quot;badschool<br/>\nsubjects&quot;. You <br/>\ncan&#39;t help it!<br/>\n<br/>\nRule seven. Ban Book Worship! You need to see all methods of getting <br/>\nknowledge into the brain as equal. Books may take a back-seat in a<br/>\nchild&#39;s learning <br/>\nfor a while. That&#39;s OK. There are MANY ways to obtain information: TV,<br/>\ngames, <br/>\neating out/eating IN, movies, vacations, talking,----yeah! just plain<br/>\nold <br/>\nenagaging each other in conversation! <br/>\n<br/>\nRule eight. The only times we cannot learn are 1) when we are in a coma<br/>\n(and <br/>\nI don&#39;t know that for sure). 2) when we are frightened. Learning stops<br/>\nwhen we <br/>\nare scared. and 3) when we are forced. Coersion is not conducive to true<br/>\n<br/>\nlearning. Regurgitation, maybe. Learning, NO.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure there are some more &quot;school rules&quot; that some of our other<br/>\n&quot;teachers&quot; <br/>\ncan add, but....I&#39;m on a rollllll....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAFTER you ban the school-think and school-speak from your mind, THEN you<br/>\ncan <br/>\nslowly start adding it in. But as unschooling &quot;teachers&quot;, our first<br/>\nlesson is <br/>\nto get you to leave those words and acts behind. We *have to* get you to<br/>\nsee <br/>\nthat you are surrounded by opportunities to learn. You can&#39;t escape it.<br/>\nYou&#39;re <br/>\nhard-wired to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nDEschooling is the healing process that takes place after school----for<br/>\nYOU <br/>\nand the child. You can&#39;t rush it any more than you can rush a broken leg<br/>\nto <br/>\nheal. You *can* do things to relieve that pain though. Offer to read to<br/>\nhim. Take <br/>\nhim out to the new Korean restaurant. Most importantly, stay away from <br/>\n&quot;classes and lessons&quot; until he&#39;s ready to accept them as &quot;just another<br/>\noption&quot;. Our <br/>\nculture puts too much emphasis on classes and lessons and teachers and <br/>\nrequirements and such. You&#39;ll need to keep that at arm&#39;s length for a<br/>\nwhile until you <br/>\nare comfortable with the idea that you CAN learn without them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Isn&#39;t part of it having the choice to choose what you want to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>learn <br/>\nand how you learn it?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you&#39;re comfortable with the idea that classes aren&#39;t the<br/>\nbe-all-end-all, <br/>\nthen you can offer some kind of specialty class---like karate or riding <br/>\nlessons or piano (Consider that John Holt High School).  AFTER you know<br/>\nin your <br/>\nheart of hearts that ALL learning is equal, that ALL learning can be<br/>\nobtained <br/>\nfrom *living*, THEN classes may eke into your unschooling life (College<br/>\nof John <br/>\nHolt).<br/>\n<br/>\nOK. I&#39;m going to send this before I lose it! &lt;G&gt; The rest of the faculty<br/>\ncan <br/>\njoin in. Maybe we can make it into a booklet for de-/unschooling! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18669,"nextTopicId":18657}}
