I feel other <br/>\n  peoples confusion or discomfort when they mistake him.  <br/>\n  I offered him a hair cut on a weekly basis for quite while.  I&#39;m just <br/>\n  now getting to the point that I am really comfortable with it, and <br/>\n  actually like it!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Joanna<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  My 5 almost 6 year old boy, Kevin, is &quot;letting his hair grow&quot; too.  I have always shaved their heads<br/>\n  and said when they were old enough to decide, they could have their hair however they<br/>\n  wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s taking me a while to get used to too.  I really liked how he looked with &quot;short&quot; hair.  So, he<br/>\n  knows that I like it better short, but of course, it is his hair.<br/>\n<br/>\n  When he was 4, we would shave all sorts of shapes and words into his head.  Most people<br/>\n  thought I was crazy! to let him &quot;tell me what to do&quot;.  We just thought it was fun!  We did<br/>\n  a dinosaur, a lightning bolt and BUZZ when he was into buzz a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s so nice to see others are going through and &quot;letting&quot; their children be themselves!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Love,<br/>\n  Kelly Jo<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7809,"nextTopicId":7816}}
