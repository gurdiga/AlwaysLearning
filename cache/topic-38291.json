It is written for parents with kids in public school and she is a mathematician who has taught at a teacher&#39;s college for over a generation. But I find it easy to discard the schooly stuff. She has some great unschooling points, such as, things like sorting silverware are all about set theory. Especially if you have mismatched silverware, like we do. There is math all around us if you stop and mindfully think about it. And when I do notice it, I can share it with my kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I love math, although I am terrible at calculations, so our kids are exposed to math in lots of different ways. My oldest and youngest do calculations in their heads but my middle son (15) is worse than I am. But he has a calculator on his cell phone. Calculations are just a tiny part of math and I made it through advanced calculus in college without being good at them and that was before there were calculators. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son did use text books to go through from algebra to calculus with me but he wanted to, and he picked out which books worked for him. We used an interesting assortment. It was also really great bonding time for us since I went through it with him. I wasn&#39;t teaching him but scribing for him because he didn&#39;t hand write.  He loves that he knows the math and won&#39;t have to take it in college, unless he wants to. And from being totally math phobic when he left school in 3rd grade, he now reads Ian Stewart for fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a child who is really into math, they can always find someone who will help them dive into the math concepts with them. And then your child can teach them to you, if you are interested. <br/>\nJae <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287815876,"authorName":"Robyn L.

Down below my rant is their list of the  <br/>\nareas I need to work on.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s some sample questions. *No* calculators. (There were a total  <br/>\nof 20.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; Divide 6847 by 43.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Remember, no calculators. Why is my question. This is ancient  <br/>\ndinosaur thinking that math teachers have passed down to math  <br/>\nteachers since the beginning of schools. As a present for my freshman  <br/>\nyear in college in 1974 I got an early electronic calculator. You had  <br/>\nto get them through the mail from Hewlett Packard. It was a  <br/>\n&quot;scientific&quot; calculator meaning it could do square roots and squares.  <br/>\nThey were $150. (How much is that in 2008 dollars? ;-) That was *34*  <br/>\nyears ago. I haven&#39;t done long division for *34* years. Before that  <br/>\npeople used *slide rules*.<br/>\n<br/>\n*WHY* are kids being made to do these ridiculous calculations by  <br/>\nhand? Math teachers will tell you they need to know. As an engineer,  <br/>\nI will tell you that&#39;s a lie.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s *really* useful is for kids to *use* numbers in ways that are  <br/>\nmeaningful to them, to get answers that mean something to what&#39;s  <br/>\nimportant to the kids. (And I can not understate how useful video  <br/>\ngames are for using math concepts in real ways!)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile my daughter is *not* a math head -- she&#39;s more of an artist and  <br/>\nwriter -- she played a lot of video games. I also walked myself  <br/>\nthrough problems when she needed an answer so she could see how I was  <br/>\nmanipulating the numbers to get to an answer. While her father did  <br/>\nshow her some cool stuff like Fibonacci numbers, the amount of math  <br/>\nshe had each week was on the order of minutes compared to hours for  <br/>\nschooled kids. When she was 14 she decided it would be fun to take  <br/>\nthe college math course (Statistics) her father taught. While she did  <br/>\nhave him on hand to ask questions of while doing homework, she took  <br/>\nthe tests just like the rest of the students. She was at or near the  <br/>\ntop of the class. A class full of students 4-5 years older with 12+  <br/>\nyears of math. (She went on to take several other math courses for  <br/>\nfun, one without him as teacher. Again, doing at or near the top of  <br/>\nthe class.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s useful to be able to get a rough guesstimate to problems like  <br/>\nthe one given. (The verbal walk through I would have given my  <br/>\ndaughter is: I would bump the first number up to 7000 and the second  <br/>\ndown to 40. Then 100 times 40 is 4000 and 200 times 40 is 8000. So  <br/>\nthe answer is closer to but less than 200. That gives you a ball park  <br/>\nanswer which is adequate for real life.) If I need an accurate  <br/>\nanswer, I&#39;m not going to rely on calculating by hand. I&#39;m going to  <br/>\nuse a calculator.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; Calculate the amount of elapsed time in hours, minutes, and seconds<br/>\n &gt; from 4:30:15 a.m. to 12:24:31 p.m.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just looking at that makes me want to pull my hair out. *When* would  <br/>\nanyone need to know down to the second how much time between those  <br/>\ntwo? *When* would anyone need to know without a calculator?<br/>\n<br/>\n*If* someone was in some field where such calculations were common,  <br/>\nthey probably would eventually figure out tricks to do it quickly. 10  <br/>\nyo kids don&#39;t need tortured with such inanities that they&#39;re unlikely  <br/>\nto ever use.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; Hiro would like to visit Japan, the homeland of his grandfather.<br/>\n &gt; The trip will cost him 200,000 Japanese yen.

($1.00 U.S. = 117.51 Yen)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My daughter is big into manga and anime and we&#39;ve often wanted to  <br/>\ncalculate how much some number of yen in a manga is in US dollars.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll tell you the trick: 1 yen is about a penny. That gets you close  <br/>\nenough to get a feel for what kind of money they&#39;re talking about.  <br/>\nJust move the decimal point over two places. 200,000 yen is  <br/>\napproximately $2000.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for this problem, first, if the guy is booking a flight from the  <br/>\nUS to Japan on the computer, they&#39;re not going to quote him a price  <br/>\nin yen. It&#39;s going to be in dollars. Okay, no matter. Say he needs  <br/>\ngrandpa to wire him the money so needs to tell him how many yen.  <br/>\nMaybe he&#39;s going through some Japanese booking center. (Grumble.  <br/>\nStupid made up question.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, he&#39;s got the browser open. He types into the search box in  <br/>\nGoogle:<br/>\n<br/>\nconvert 200000 yen into US$<br/>\n<br/>\nand it comes back and tells him:<br/>\n<br/>\n200 000 Japanese yen = 1 869.2 US$<br/>\n<br/>\nQuicker, more accurate, with up to the minute currency values than  <br/>\ndoing it by hand with an out of date conversion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; Find the volume of the frustum.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What the heck is a frustum?

In real life, you&#39;d understand  <br/>\nwhy the problem is set up that way and why you wanted the answer and  <br/>\nwhat you wanted to do with the answer once you had it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; If it costs $3.50 for each person to swim, how much money did the<br/>\n &gt; pool make last weekend?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is not far off questions that actually come up in real life.<br/>\n<br/>\n(At least that&#39;s what I said originally. On second glance, it&#39;s not.  <br/>\nThe question is stupid.<br/>\nIf the pool charges everyone the same, they&#39;re not going to know how  <br/>\nmany of each they have.<br/>\nBut, it is *vaguely* similar to real life questions.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that when kids who aren&#39;t grasping math are faced with  <br/>\nthese word problems over and over, they tend to freeze up over time  <br/>\nand their brains shut down at the first hint of something that smells  <br/>\nlike a word problem. So even when faced with a real life one that  <br/>\nthey actually care about, they can cringe and feel like they can&#39;t do  <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when things like this are just part of life, when mom walks  <br/>\nthrough *real life* problems in front of the kids while she finds an  <br/>\nanswer for them (or lets them if they&#39;re saying &quot;No, don&#39;t tell  <br/>\nme!&quot;), the problems aren&#39;t scary and kids can see why the problem is  <br/>\nworded as it is because the kids understand the real context and they  <br/>\nknow why they want to know an answer.<br/>\n<br/>\n(In this particular problem, the pie chart showing how many adults,  <br/>\nchildren and students there were was too small to read.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; Draw an expression for the situation below. Matt has 4 more video<br/>\n &gt; games than Sarah. Sarah has x video games. How many video games<br/>\n &gt; does Matt have?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To make things really confusing, the answer was &quot;None of the above.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen does anyone ever solve problems like that? They&#39;re fun for kids  <br/>\nwho love puzzles. And you can buy books of them -- *not* workbooks,  <br/>\nbut *real* puzzle books -- at grocery store checkouts and book stores.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile this problem is a math book version of an algebra problem,  <br/>\nagain, the huge problem with it is that when would someone ever set  <br/>\nup a problem that way and why do they want the answer?<br/>\n<br/>\nReal life problems have meaning. When my daughter was 10ish maybe --  <br/>\nand without demonstrating any previous need or desire to set up such  <br/>\nproblems -- she asked, &quot;Do you know how long it would take to drive  <br/>\nfrom Boston to LA?&quot; At the time we were in the Pittsburgh airport. We  <br/>\nwere waiting for a flight to LA. We had driven from Boston to  <br/>\nPittsburgh a lot to see my father so she knew driving took 11 hours.  <br/>\nShe knew the flight had taken -- I can&#39;t remember now, but say 3  <br/>\nhours. She knew the next leg of the flight was 6 (guessing again.) So  <br/>\nshe said 33 hours. Absolutely spot on algebraic reasoning.<br/>\n<br/>\n*That&#39;s* real life algebra. She could see how all the pieces fit  <br/>\ntogether. She had a desire for the answer. She found a way to use  <br/>\nwhat she knew to find out what she didn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; Find the mean of the following numbers: 19, 13, 25, 21, 19, 5<br/>\n &gt; Remember, no calculator.<br/>\n<br/>\n &gt; Not tortured enough? Do it again. Find the median of the following<br/>\n &gt; numbers: 14, 19, 17, 14, 24, 14<br/>\n<br/>\n &gt; Find the mode of the following numbers: 10, 3, 23, 20, 23, 13, 13<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You *do* of course remember what a mode is, don&#39;t you? You&#39;ve  <br/>\nprobably used it 100s of times in real life.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, you haven&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile some people do use modes (I used them in programming and the  <br/>\nprofessor explained them in a couple of minutes), and probably some  <br/>\nbranches of statistics. 10 yos don&#39;t need modes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids will get a kick out of them. But there&#39;s absolutely no  <br/>\nreason to make a 10 yo learn them. There&#39;s even more of a reason not  <br/>\nto make a 10 yo feel inadequate for not knowing or not caring.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; Find the odds against rolling a 5 or a 6 on a die.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I really liked probability in college. It was a nice respite before  <br/>\nwe hit statistics ;-) While kids might have fun with probability,  <br/>\nthey don&#39;t need to learn it when they&#39;re 10. It&#39;s easy to grasp,  <br/>\ntakes minutes to learn when you&#39;re 18. Hours and hours when you&#39;re 10  <br/>\nif you don&#39;t understand why you&#39;re being made to do it. (And the  <br/>\ndanger is that kids will decide they either hate math or that they&#39;re  <br/>\ndumb at math.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that was a few of the questions. And here&#39;s what the site says  <br/>\nI need to work on. Goodness, there were only 20 questions!

They  <br/>\nteach notation and formulas. They *hope* kids pick up how numbers  <br/>\nwork and how to manipulate number information by going through the  <br/>\ndrill of notation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not that they don&#39;t want to teach concepts, but it&#39;s really hard  <br/>\nto test whether kids understand concepts. So they teach what can be  <br/>\ntested and hope some how the kids grasp the concepts. (From the  <br/>\nnumber of people who end up mathphobic, schools are doing more damage  <br/>\nthan good. The kids who grasp math, do it in spite of instruction  <br/>\nrather than because of it :-/ )<br/>\n<br/>\nTeaching the notation for concepts kids don&#39;t understand is *really*  <br/>\nhard. That&#39;s why it takes so much time and so much practice. It&#39;s  <br/>\nlike teaching kids to write before they understand what language is.  <br/>\nAnd a negative consequence is that kids can shut down when they see  <br/>\nreal world uses of the concepts that might help them grasp the  <br/>\nconcepts, like freezing up with they see 20% free.<br/>\n<br/>\nReal understanding of numbers comes from using them for personally  <br/>\nmeaningful reasons. And it takes very little time. Minutes per week  <br/>\nrather than hours. Allowance. Video games. Cooking.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalk out loud when you&#39;re solving a problem, like when they ask, &quot;How  <br/>\nlong until Daddy gets home?&quot; &quot;Well, it&#39;s 11 now, and he gets home at  <br/>\n6, so&quot; holding up your fingers as you count out the hours &quot;11, 12, 1,  <br/>\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6&quot; so 8 hours. This is *not* a lesson. You&#39;re not doing  <br/>\nthis for them, just talking out your thought process out loud. Don&#39;t  <br/>\nfeel that they need to see you do this. It&#39;s just helpful to have it  <br/>\nswirling around in the atmosphere.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearn how to manipulate numbers in your head so you don&#39;t go through  <br/>\nthe torture that you were made to do in school: If they ask &quot;What&#39;s 23 <br/>\n+18?&quot; (say they have two toys they want to buy and want to know if  <br/>\nthey have enough.) &quot;That&#39;d be the same as 21+20 so 41.&quot; *Estimate*  <br/>\nwhen things get large. &quot;How many times does 38 go into 1234?&quot; &quot;Well,  <br/>\n38&#39;s almost 40 and 1234 is a little more than 1200, so about 300.&quot; If  <br/>\nthey need more accuracy, use a calculator.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s *much* easier for kids to learn the notation after they&#39;ve done  <br/>\nlots of real, personally meaningful number manipulation that gives  <br/>\nthem the information they want. They learn how numbers work from that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s nothing wrong with kids liking math worksheets. But  <br/>\nworksheets will get in the way of a parent grasping unschooling if  <br/>\nthe parent sees something necessary in the worksheets that the child  <br/>\nwill miss without them. They should be seen as just something to play  <br/>\nwith, like a coloring book or a crossword puzzle.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: unschooling and math","postDate":"1221418771","msgId":38297,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENDRTRBOUQyLUZEOTItNDEwRS1CQUM0LTgxRTQ0NjM4MjA5MkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdham1ncitrZW1pQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdham1ncitrZW1pQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38296,"nextInTopic":38298,"prevInTime":38296,"nextInTime":38298,"topicId":38291,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-As a math geek and college math instructor, it was not easy to let go.-=- And for me, being math-wounded, it spooks me even to see the phrase college math","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1928122281\">-=-As a math geek and college math instructor, it was not easy to let  <br/>\ngo.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for me, being math-wounded, it spooks me even to see the phrase  <br/>\n&quot;college math instructor.&quot;  But I was able to find ways not to pass  <br/>\nthat on to my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can do math when it&#39;s in English.
