My understanding of why it<br/>\nworks is because when you adjust the neck and head areas (for lack of the<br/>\ntechnical term) that allows the ear tubes to drain and then the<br/>\ninfection/inflamation to recede.  His ears were coated in yeast, and that<br/>\nwas part of what was causing the inflamation and pain.  The antibiotics<br/>\nwould have made that worse.  Her other recommendations were to candle his<br/>\nears, somthing I can describe later.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo find a good chiro I would ask around and see who you can find.  We found<br/>\na chiro who specializes in kids and is truly wonderful with them and has a<br/>\nlot of experience with dealing with fears and tears.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to go, but if I didn&#39;t answer your question or if you have more let<br/>\nme know.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarrie<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;coyote&#39;s corner&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:janis@...\">janis@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, November 15, 2003 2:29 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Neck Strain/Sprain<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Carrie,<br/>\n&gt; This is the first I&#39;ve heard of a chirp for infection!
