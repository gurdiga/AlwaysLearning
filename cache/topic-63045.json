Telling someone who&#39;s very invested in school about unschooling isn&#39;t going to produce a lot of learning. Just saying &quot;homeschool&quot; is going to be a shock and the most you can expect is to shake up that person&#39;s stereotypical image of &quot;homeschooler&quot; - but even that&#39;s a good thing! The more people who know that homeschooling, much less unschooling, is possible and more-or-less normal (as opposed to something only freaky people do) the more families will have One More Option in their lives. That&#39;s good.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I guess generally our goal is just to live a happy life, and hopefully pass that happy life expectation on to our kids, but how will people who aren&#39;t understanding this concept already ever get the thought in their heads that there might be another way to go if we don&#39;t tell them?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*******************<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience, the vast majority of Bad information about unschooling comes from people who&#39;ve heard about it but don&#39;t really get it. I honestly believe that more people are pushed away from unschooling by bad information, information like &quot;they just let their kids do anything&quot; than any other reason - sadly, some people actually try it, too, thinking it sounds really liberating and, gosh, some people seem to make it work. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Why not plant a seed about what we see as such an obvious thing...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A homeschooling mom planted a tiny little seed in my mind more than twenty years ago, she said: &quot;I like my kid, I like being around him&quot;. I don&#39;t know if they were home or unschooling, really, but that one sentence gave me enough hope that it was possible for parents to go on liking their kids, enjoying parenting, to hunt around for other parents who had found that same thing and then figure out what they were doing. In between that sentence and finding the people who were actually making unschooling work in real life, I heard a whole lot about &quot;unschooling&quot; which pushed me away. I met parents who were &quot;unschooling&quot; babies and had wild ideas about freedom and no personal experience and parents who neglected their kids in the name of personal liberation until those kids demanded to go to school. I sometimes wonder if I hadn&#39;t heard about unschooling from people with half-baked ideas if I&#39;d have found the Good information sooner - because for awhile I avoided reading anything about unschooling. I&#39;d met Those people and didn&#39;t want their lives. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the thing is, I value personal happiness so a seed about liking my kid was useful to me. It grew from something I already understood. If I valued success or owning up to responsibilities more, that seed wouldn&#39;t have had as much of a chance. If you say &quot;this is unschooling&quot; to someone who thinks a child playing video games is rotting his brain, that&#39;s not a see which is going to grow. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Family visiting - Discussing Unschooling","postDate":"1316803329","msgId":63095,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdCRDFGOTQ4LTYxODItNDA4MS04QzA3LUU4NEQyMTYwQjhGRUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEM5NDAxQUJBLTNDNEQtNEU4Ny1CMjYyLTE1QjZCMkJFMDQwMUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGo1aWQ0OSttcWVzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8Qzk0MDFBQkEtM0M0RC00RTg3LUIyNjItMTVCNkIyQkUwNDAxQHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":63094,"nextInTopic":63105,"prevInTime":63094,"nextInTime":63096,"topicId":63045,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Family visiting - Discussing Unschooling","postDate":"1316801969","msgId":63091,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM5NDAxQUJBLTNDNEQtNEU4Ny1CMjYyLTE1QjZCMkJFMDQwMUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGo1aWQ0OSttcWVzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGo1aWQ0OSttcWVzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":63089,"nextInTopic":63094,"prevInTime":63090,"nextInTime":63092,"topicId":63045,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Unschooling looks like neglect, or the parents have a very  <br/>\ndifferent set of values and goals.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as kids learn naturally by gathering bits and pieces about, say,  <br/>\nCeasar, and building a framework about him and about Rome and so on,  <br/>\nso society will learn about unschooling. When I first started  <br/>\nhomeschooling 15 years ago, people would ask &quot;Is that legal?&quot; 15 years  <br/>\nlater, the more common reaction was &quot;Oh, my cousin does that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is filtering out into society. People are encountering it  <br/>\nhere and there. As they become more comfortable with unschooling and  <br/>\nwith the idea that maybe all this pressure to get into college isn&#39;t  <br/>\nwhat it &#39;s all about, then they&#39;ll maybe look at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it can take several generations before there&#39;s enough shift in  <br/>\nwhat they want, enough encounter with alternatives that are more  <br/>\nfamiliar and feeling more comfortable that they&#39;ll be able to really  <br/>\nstart looking into it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; how will people who aren&#39;t understanding this concept already ever  <br/>\n&gt; get the thought in their heads that there might be another way to go  <br/>\n&gt; if we don&#39;t tell them?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How will people ever get the thought in their heads that Jesus is  <br/>\ntheir personal savior if people don&#39;t tell them?<br/>\n<br/>\n*That* works really well if you don&#39;t want the message, doesn&#39;t it?<br/>\n<br/>\nConservative Christians have actually done pretty well with a method  <br/>\nthat&#39;s very off putting because it offers what many people are already  <br/>\nlooking for: security and confidence that someone has all the right  <br/>\nanswers and can tell them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIT seems like there are more people questioning the rush to the  <br/>\nsecurity of a white picket fence life. But I think far more people are  <br/>\nquestioning the current schooling approach to getting there than they  <br/>\nare the white picket fence.

My inlaws will be visiting next month and this will be their first visit now that our son is officially &quot;school age&quot; so even though they&#39;ve known we planned to homeschool for a long time, this is the first time they&#39;ll be visiting us during a time when they&#39;ll expect us to be &quot;doing school&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband has actually brought up unschooling with them (and I was thinking, &quot;NOooo, they&#39;re not ready for that! Tell them we&#39;re homeschooling!&quot;). But it pretty much went right over their heads and they were still asking questions about how early Josh will have to get up and if he&#39;s going to get a backpack and new clothes for school so he can be ready to get to work on his first day, etc. They definitely have pictured a very school-at-home approach and I think their visit will be eye-opening to them (either that or they&#39;ll think we took a vacation week while they were here). <br/>\n<br/>\nI try to remember that her questions are coming from a place of love and concern. She was a special needs preschool teacher for many years so she&#39;s already expressed concern over Josh&#39;s speech among other things, so when she asks about curriculum and I try to explain our approach she gets worried. She asks lots of questions about the state checking up on us, meeting with a teacher, taking tests, and all the other ways she thought the gov&#39;t would be keeping track of homeschoolers. She was surprised to learn that we don&#39;t even have to report anything until next year.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith some our acquaintances I&#39;ve answered some questions by reminding them that he&#39;s in Kindergarten so it&#39;s a bit different (not that I feel like the later years need a different approach/philosophy, but just that I don&#39;t want to explain unschooling to every person we meet and for now that seems to work). I&#39;m not sure that it is the best answer, but it usually makes people stop and relax about it (unless they then say, &quot;Right, kindergarten is mostly about socialization...oh...homeschooling...socialization...homeschooling...&quot;). But I&#39;m just not sure that approach will be very helpful with my mother in law since she was a teacher for so many years. I definitely think unschooling is something we have to ease her into slowly over a number of years and that down the road it will be easier to see how great this has been for our kids and her fears were not realized.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-Annie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":283530155,"authorName":"JustSayin","from":"&quot;JustSayin&quot; &lt;mfcappella@...&gt;","profile":"mfcappella","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Family visiting","postDate":"1316580329","msgId":63058,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGo1YnE1OStwajBuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGo1YXRuYitkNjczQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":63056,"nextInTopic":63060,"prevInTime":63057,"nextInTime":63059,"topicId":63045,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

During that visit I had a really lengthy talk with my stepmother about what we were doing (or not doing), about temperaments (my kids&#39; that is), and about how I thought society could benefit from people who are not demnoralized or dehumanized by the schooling process.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was so excited (and quite frankly, surprised), that she seemed to &quot;get it&quot; and share my enthusiasm about what we were doing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell fast forward a month or so, and I was talking to her on the phone about something else, and she says &quot;your father and I are really worried about those children&quot; - it took me a minute to figure out she meant MY children.  Turns out she didn&#39;t &quot;get it&quot; at all.  I don&#39;t care, because they are not in our lives in any real way, but I was taken aback by this turnaround and it kind of left me at a loss for words.  When we next visited them she was trying to force my boys to read books with her, and when they politely declined, she decided they were illiterate (they were/are not, quite the contrary).   We got nothing but books from them that next Christmas, which I still laugh about.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know this isn&#39;t exactly helpful. But when I think about whether I would do or say anything different if I had it to do over, I would not.  I would be compromising my own principles to claim or imply that we are doing school at home just to make them more comfortable, especially when I am so opposed to that idea.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy family all know (not because I said it, but somehow they know) that I would choose my kids and our commitment to unschooling over staying connected to them (I must confess that my family is not very close to start with; emotionally or geographically).  It may not be so easy for someone else to take such a strong stand. <br/>\n<br/>\nI will say that when I had what I thought was that good talk with my stepmother, I talked about general philosophies, about human nature,  about how my kids felt when they were in school (they were in school for a short time), how I felt about my own school experience, and how teaching content is obsolete.  I think that&#39;s why she couldn&#39;t &quot;disagree&quot;, I wasn&#39;t really saying anything wacky, just a discussion about ideas, really.  Only when she thought about it later did she realize what it all meant.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d say your best bet is to leave it as general as possible and then just drop it (if that&#39;s possible).
