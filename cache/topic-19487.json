That&#39;s a comfort. When April<br/>\nturned eighteen she went to a slumber party with her girlfriends (no boys)<br/>\nand they bought enough booze to sink the Titanic. April came close to<br/>\npoisoning herself... This was the tail end of a three month experiment with<br/>\nalcohol stage during a time she was meeting and making new friends... After<br/>\nher binge episode she she couldn&#39;t touch a drop of alcohol for about three<br/>\nyears without feeling very ill. She was then able to introduce the odd half<br/>\nglass of beer, and then a half glass of spirit with cola/juice. She<br/>\ninvariably can&#39;t finish her drink and usually doesn&#39;t bother. It&#39;s six<br/>\nyears on now and she can put away a couple of glass of beer now and then.<br/>\nWe were rapt that her body rejected the alcohol so vehemently - it&#39;s been a<br/>\ngood lesson for her brothers too. We made sure she had a safe place to<br/>\nexperiment with alcohol (she wouldn&#39;t smoke pot because of her asthma and<br/>\nhates cigarettes with a vengeance). We didn&#39;t say no or prohibit and things<br/>\nworked out well. But we&#39;re not overly addictive people and we have a<br/>\nhistory of allergies, so that probably helped.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19449,"nextTopicId":19488}}
