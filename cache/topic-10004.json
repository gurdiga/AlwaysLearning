Sorry, I am fighting off the<br/>\nflu and feeling fuzzy headed.  I am ordering their<br/>\nleader&#39;s handbook, and unless there is something there<br/>\nto dissuade me, I anticipate getting involved with<br/>\ntheir programs.   I have located another local family,<br/>\npossibly two, with kids my kid&#39;s ages, who are<br/>\ninterested in Roots & Shoots as well.  So that speaks<br/>\nto me serendipitously.  I located them through our<br/>\nlocal homeschooling exchange as well, so they are<br/>\nhomeschoolers as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again to a great list.  I knew I could count on<br/>\nyou for no nonsense practical wisdom and no flaming. <br/>\nBy the way, I think it&#39;s funny that this &quot;quiet back<br/>\nroom&quot; of a list has almost 300 members!
