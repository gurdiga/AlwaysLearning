They said A/S/L (age/sex/location) is the only personal thing they&#39;ve seen people asking.  Well, that and people asking my 16 yo if he is African American or predjudice because his username is Black As You. (A friend signed him up at Merlefest last year and picked that name for him, being silly.) It&#39;s actually been neat for him to talk with people on Runescape about this subject, with us living here in the deep south where there is SO much predjudice! His standard answer is &quot;Yes, I&#39;m as black as you and you are as white as me, inside we are all the same color!&quot; I&#39;ve considered asking him to change his user name, but he is at such a high level it would be a loss of alot of work.  Any advice about this would be welcome!<br/>\n<br/>\nThey LOVE Runescape so much we recently started paying the $5 monthly fee to access the whole Runescape world. They suggest new players start out with the free areas until you are very familiar with the game.
