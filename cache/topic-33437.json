I&#39;m  <br/>\npretty<br/>\nlaid back about it, then when the house starts to look thrashed I  <br/>\nbecome &quot;Sarge<br/>\nMom&quot; and belt out orders. I hate when that happens. Their rooms I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t really<br/>\nworry about - I just shut the door. I&#39;m just looking for creative  <br/>\nideas for the<br/>\nrest of the house. Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond:<br/>\nWhat do you mean by thrashed? Kids toys everywhere? General cleaning<br/>\nnot kept up? It sounds like you clean only in crisis mode, when it&#39;s<br/>\nreached a critical point. Perhaps you can try cleaning more regularly<br/>\nso it doesn&#39;t get to that point. My kids have always loved doing<br/>\nhousework such as vacuuming, dusting, wiping banisters, mopping<br/>\nfloors, and cleaning windows. I&#39;ve always let them have fun doing it<br/>\nand don&#39;t criticize their efforts in any way. Over the years their<br/>\nskills have improved and housework isn&#39;t a dreaded thing like I see in<br/>\nsome other families.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat lots of families here do is to think of housework in a different  <br/>\nway, instead of as something kids should be made to do, and different  <br/>\nfrom thinking mom&#39;s a martyr who has to do everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some reports and commentary here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/influencing%20kid%20behavior/chores/\">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/influencing%20kid%20behavior/chores/</a> <br/>\nhouseworktips.html<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/chores\">http://sandradodd.com/chores</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/influencing%20kid%20behavior/chores/\">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/influencing%20kid%20behavior/chores/</a> <br/>\nkidstohelpwithchores.html<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33520,"nextTopicId":33552}}
