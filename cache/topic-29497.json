I <br/>\nlooked at it as a gift to her to take it off her at night while she was <br/>\nsleeping and wash it for her. I felt it was the least I could do <br/>\nwhen there was a lot going on that she didn&#39;t have any say over <br/>\nand she wasn&#39;t exactly thrilled about. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I also agreed that we weren&#39;t going to take her <br/>\nout in public in her &quot;dirty shirt&quot; when, eventually, it didn&#39;t get clean. <br/>\nWe lived in L.A., and not only did we get a lot of scrutiny because <br/>\nwe homeschool, but having four children in the Westside of L.A. <br/>\nmade us conspicuous as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, she could look presentable when she put a jumper or a <br/>\ndress on over it. I  found another shirt that she also liked and <br/>\neventually that one would work, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, BTW, she&#39;s 5, and she loves wearing lots of different kinds <br/>\nof clothes!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest son also liked wearing the same clothes when he was <br/>\nbetween 6 and 11. Even now, he usually has one pair of shorts <br/>\n(he wears shorts in SoCal year-round), and I wash them a few <br/>\ntimes a week. He has other pants, if need be. He&#39;s just happier <br/>\nbeing comfortable and familiar clothing feels good to him. For a <br/>\nwhile, he had one shirt, too, that he wore like a uniform -- and I&#39;d <br/>\nwash it regularly and ask him not to wear it when it looked too <br/>\ndirty. (Part of it with him is the time-saving angle as well.) <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I, too, wear limited clothing options. That is, I <br/>\ntend to get in clothing jags myself. As long as the clothes are <br/>\nclean and I&#39;m not in the workplace, where it could become a <br/>\nsource of gossip/cattiness, it works. Right now, I have a dress <br/>\nthat I got on a clearance rack at Target that fits well and looks <br/>\nfairly dressy, and I wear that a lot. Men always hold doors open <br/>\nfor me when I&#39;m wearing it.  I also have some more casual <br/>\nclothes -- T-shirts and leggings and cropped jeans, but my <br/>\nTarget dress gets worn a lot, particularly if I&#39;m going to be out <br/>\nand about. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband buys five or six pairs of the exact same pair of pants <br/>\nevery few years. Which exact brand/style of pants he buys will <br/>\nchange, but they&#39;re always the same color (black) and he always <br/>\nbuys multiple copies of the same pair. He also will find <br/>\nlong-sleeved button-down shirts he likes to wear to work and <br/>\nrotate them through his closet. He&#39;s also very disciplined and will <br/>\n&quot;retire&quot; a shirt when he gets a new one, so he always has the <br/>\nsame number of shirts in his closet. He likes doing that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also noticed other friends who do the same thing -- wear the <br/>\nsame clothes, just wash them more frequently.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathleen Whitfield<br/>\nin SoCal</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":288824710,"authorName":"jen mobley","from":"&quot;jen mobley&quot; &lt;jenpmobley@...&gt;","profile":"atomickiss2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"2"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Wearing the same clothes day after day (Long)","postDate":"1182816820","msgId":29557,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTEyOS1GMjRDODUzMTI2MzRBMDkyOUU3MkJBN0NFMEIwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PDM4RERBNkFFLTE0MDQtNDZDQS1CMkE4LUQzNTQxMjQwRjMzNUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":29545,"nextInTopic":29558,"prevInTime":29556,"nextInTime":29558,"topicId":29497,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"my daughter and I have discussed this issue and I believe we can work through it.

So we talked about how it&#39;s okay to<br/>\n&gt;touch any part of his body when he&#39;s in private space - the bathtub,<br/>\n&gt;his bedroom, etc. But when he is in other areas of the house or when<br/>\n&gt;we are in public, it&#39;s not polite to touch his genitals, even on top<br/>\n&gt;of his clothes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We use the words &quot;stop holding&quot; as a gentle reminder whenever we saw<br/>\n&gt;him doing it.

If she feels like it&#39;s too much trouble to locate pants, and a shirt, and undies, and socks, maybe it&#39;s just easier to put on the stuff she&#39;d already been wearing.  If that&#39;s the case, maybe it would help to group her clothes in complete outfits, or set out something for her, or see if she&#39;s got any ideas to make getting some clothes together easier.  If it&#39;s the feeling or smell (or something) of clean clothes she doesn&#39;t like, maybe see if a different detergent or dryer sheet would change things.  Or maybe softer fabrics.  I&#39;ve got family members with very strong convictions about how clothes can feel (especially regarding seems, collars, sleeves, anything that can potentially chafe or rub or constrict), so maybe it&#39;s got something to do with already-worn clothes being less irritating.
