They&#39;re <br/>\npost screening. But, rule of thumb ... never give more than is requested. (They <br/>\ncan however, freely expand on the info that you do give. I&#39;ve recently been <br/>\ngetting mail addressed to Dean Gregory &lt;g&gt;.) <br/>\n<br/>\nI put &quot;other&quot; for grade level, gave them our school name (GG Academy - Gifted <br/>\nand Gorgeous &lt;g&gt;, renamed from Gregory Girls by my three strongly humor <br/>\nridden daughters &lt;g&gt;), and I used the same &quot;residential&quot; address for both home and <br/>\nschool. We&#39;d received it quickly, maybe all of three weeks???<br/>\n <br/>\nSubmitting another registration application with only required information <br/>\nwill likely do the trick. I&#39;d ignore their request for more.
