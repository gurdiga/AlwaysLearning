In fact, we<br/>\nmeet on Thursdays, also!<br/>\nWe usually follow some sort of theme during the year and each meeting<br/>\nincorporates craft projects, books, food or something about the theme. I see<br/>\nit as a way the group members can justify bringing their kids once a week to<br/>\nget together, because at least they are &quot;learning&quot; about something.<br/>\nOtherwise, the diligent homeschoolers in our group could not see wasting a<br/>\nday just on kids playing together.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll our kids also have the option of not participating if they choose - I<br/>\nthink that&#39;s important. Sometimes the whole thing irritates me a bit, too,<br/>\nwith importance given on individual reports or projects to give, and then I<br/>\nsee my kids struggling a bit to complete their &quot;assignment&quot;. But in<br/>\nretrospect, I realize we have had fun participating in these weekly classes<br/>\nand learning together in this non-threatening environment really makes it<br/>\nfun for all of us. The kids get a chance to see and play with other kids and<br/>\nus parents get a chance to talk, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps you feel negative about the whole thing because it meets once a<br/>\nweek for 4 hours. To me, that is big time commitment that starts grating on<br/>\nme after a while and really gets old. But I continue going because my kids<br/>\nenjoy the whole thing. And I also like it because through the group, we are<br/>\nparticipating in activities and learning things we may not otherwise get<br/>\nexposed to, at home. It&#39;s a little give and take, but hey, it DOES make<br/>\nlearning fun, and that&#39;s a good thing for all of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;homeschoolmd&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I did not mention that this class is supposed to last a long time and<br/>\n&gt; not be just a one or two day thing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The plan is for the class to be held every Thursday from 10-2 and for<br/>\n&gt; it to move from geography to food, clothing, history, economics, art,<br/>\n&gt; music and then religion.

My <br/>\nkids don&#39;t only do things with other unschooled kids/families -- and <br/>\nsometimes when they do something the other people are there for very <br/>\ndifferent reasons. Sometimes it doesn&#39;t work out well - sometimes it does - <br/>\neven things that are really obviously nonacademic are sometimes fraught with <br/>\nthis kind of dichotomy. My 11 yo is going to soccer daycamp this week and it <br/>\nis OBVIOUS that there are kids there because they LOOOOOVE to play soccer and <br/>\nthere are other kids there because they had to be babysat during the day and <br/>\nthis was what their parents chose for them for this week. Plus - there are <br/>\nkids there whose parents are pushing them to be soccer-superstars and other <br/>\nkids who are there because their parents decided they needed more exercise <br/>\nand so on and on. The coaches probably have totally different ideas, too, <br/>\nabout what the camp is &quot;really&quot; for -- but as long as my daughter wants to go <br/>\nand find it meets her own interests - I don&#39;t concern myself with why the <br/>\nother kids are there and why the coaches are coaching, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, a LOT of the stuff they do at soccer camp is designed to &quot;trick&quot; the <br/>\nkids into learning something --- they play all kinds of different games, each <br/>\ndesigned to help them learn a certain skill or strategy. That&#39;s okay - they <br/>\nhave fun playing the games and they LIKE to learn. I&#39;d take that mom&#39;s <br/>\nattitude as sort of being like that of the soccer coaches -- assume kids LOVE <br/>\nto learn - provide them with activities that are fun, in and of themselves, <br/>\nAND during which they pick up some information or cocepts about something <br/>\ninteresting -- sounds cool to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf she started sending hom boring &quot;homework&quot; or started sitting them down and <br/>\ngiving them tests on what they should have been tricked into learning, then <br/>\nI&#39;d have a problem with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt CAN have a huge impact, of course -- the attitudes of the other kids and <br/>\nthe coaches could make it something that my daughter chooses to not do.

When our children were younger, it was much harder for me in those type of situtations. My skin would begin to crawl at the thought of so much instruction for activity at a young age. Our children have always been sooooo busy without anyone giving any type of direction. When situtations like this came up when ours were younger (which some still are!) I know that my feelings got in the way and our children sensed it and knew something was up. Thats just the way it was. I was able to stay netural at times, in areas that felt ok, maybe not ideal (whatever ideal is!!). Now that the older ones are older, the situtaions that I don&#39;t feel are to my liking, are mine. They participate in a variety of things because they are ready. Because they are branching out, reaching, growing, becoming more seperate. And making choices based on their experiences. If it doesn&#39;t feel right to them, they listen to that inner voice.

I don&#39;t want to get in a trap<br/>\nof talking about other parents or kids who are misbehaving.  I think if<br/>\nthis mom is trying to get her kid to study geography and history through<br/>\na topic of the silk roads in a way that is not straight forward than it<br/>\nis between her and her kids.  Your observations can be expressed if the<br/>\ndiscussion comes up, but my advice is to just focus on your own way and<br/>\nfamily and allow this parent to make a mistake.  I make parenting<br/>\nmistakes all the time.  I try to go by my heart.  When I make a mistake<br/>\nmy father always tells me about it and it gets me mad, but if I realize<br/>\nit on my own than I am okay, and learn from the humility of the moment.<br/>\nIf the behavior of someone in a group, the kid or parent, is negative,<br/>\nperhaps it is better to use an &quot;I feel&quot; message and point out the<br/>\nsituation, not the cause of it because there may be many causes some we<br/>\ndon&#39;t even see.  Don&#39;t we all have an inner child that needs to be<br/>\nnurtured?  And isn&#39;t it admirable when we can see this inner child in<br/>\nother parents as well?

In fact,<br/>\nwe<br/>\nmeet on Thursdays, also!<br/>\nWe usually follow some sort of theme during the year and each meeting<br/>\nincorporates craft projects, books, food or something about the theme. I<br/>\nsee<br/>\nit as a way the group members can justify bringing their kids once a<br/>\nweek to<br/>\nget together, because at least they are &quot;learning&quot; about something.<br/>\nOtherwise, the diligent homeschoolers in our group could not see wasting<br/>\na<br/>\nday just on kids playing together.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll our kids also have the option of not participating if they choose -<br/>\nI<br/>\nthink that&#39;s important. Sometimes the whole thing irritates me a bit,<br/>\ntoo,<br/>\nwith importance given on individual reports or projects to give, and<br/>\nthen I<br/>\nsee my kids struggling a bit to complete their &quot;assignment&quot;. But in<br/>\nretrospect, I realize we have had fun participating in these weekly<br/>\nclasses<br/>\nand learning together in this non-threatening environment really makes<br/>\nit<br/>\nfun for all of us. The kids get a chance to see and play with other kids<br/>\nand<br/>\nus parents get a chance to talk, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps you feel negative about the whole thing because it meets once a<br/>\nweek for 4 hours. To me, that is big time commitment that starts grating<br/>\non<br/>\nme after a while and really gets old. But I continue going because my<br/>\nkids<br/>\nenjoy the whole thing. And I also like it because through the group, we<br/>\nare<br/>\nparticipating in activities and learning things we may not otherwise get<br/>\nexposed to, at home. It&#39;s a little give and take, but hey, it DOES make<br/>\nlearning fun, and that&#39;s a good thing for all of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;homeschoolmd&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I did not mention that this class is supposed to last a long time and<br/>\n&gt; not be just a one or two day thing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The plan is for the class to be held every Thursday from 10-2 and for<br/>\n&gt; it to move from geography to food, clothing, history, economics, art,<br/>\n&gt; music and then religion.
