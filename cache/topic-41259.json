Most of the other parents tell the kids <br/>\nto go and play, they don&#39;t want to be with their own kids. A few weeks ago at a party a <br/>\nfriend said to me and another mom, while we were in a separate room with the kids, &quot;Why <br/>\ndon&#39;t you come and hang out with the people?&quot;. I probably would not have found that so <br/>\nweird had I not been an Unschooling mom.<br/>\nI want to be with my son. He and my husband are the most fun people I know. <br/>\n<br/>\nToday at a New year&#39;s party Logan said he wanted to go home. He&#39;s been a real homebody <br/>\nlately.<br/>\nMy friend  said, &quot;Wow, that&#39;s a testament to you, Henry never wants to go home. You and <br/>\nLogan must do a lot of fun things together&quot;.<br/>\nI had not thought of it that way until she said it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I do not come from AP or Unschooling families, and none of our friends <br/>\nare raising their kids the way we are, so this is as much a learning experience for us as it <br/>\nis for Logan.<br/>\nSo, on this New Year&#39;s Day I want say thanks.<br/>\nI feel freedom as a parent that I did not think was possible.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41250,"nextTopicId":41254}}
