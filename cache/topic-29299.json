He hates them.<br/>\nThank you school for teaching my son to hate reading books. My son<br/>\nhas never read a book since school and that was five years ago. He&#39;s<br/>\nhad not even one minute of a reading lesson since school. Yet his<br/>\nreading is excellent.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron left school at the end of 6th grade with the same attitude: he <br/>\nwould never read another boook. He hated reading. *School* taught him <br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took *years* before he read a book (he&#39;d read magazines and music <br/>\nscores and such). His first book after leaving school was Rue Kream&#39;s <br/>\nParenting a Free Child. I think he was *almost* 18 when he read that. <br/>\nHis second was Stargirl by Jerry Spinelli.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now he&#39;s finishing up Hermann Hesse&#39;s Siddhartha. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s a *very* slow reader, and he looks up *all* unfamiliar words. But <br/>\nhe now always has a book (and a dictionary) nearby, just in case.<br/>\n<br/>\nI doubt it will ever be a passion, but he&#39;s learning that it&#39;s not this <br/>\nhorrible, painful activity that it was in school. He&#39;s *enjoying* it! <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAOL now offers free email to everyone.
