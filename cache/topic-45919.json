My <br/>\nyoungest daughter was in a big dance show - in one piece. This was the <br/>\nfirst and, so far, only time she&#39;d ever been in a show. The show&#39;s <br/>\ndirector and I were in the lobby - I was setting up the concessions for <br/>\nintermission. The director TOLD me that Rosie&#39;s piece would be the first <br/>\none after the intermission. I was waiting in the lobby and the director <br/>\nwent into the theater. About 10 minutes later, I suddenly realized that <br/>\nI was hearing the END of the music for Rosie&#39;s dance number. I rushed in <br/>\njust in time to see the bows. I&#39;d MISSED it. The director had changed <br/>\nher mind and decided not to have an intermission. I was FURIOUS. I <br/>\ncried. I yelled at the director in front of a bunch of people. I totally <br/>\nlost my temper. I could hardly face my daughter and tell her what had <br/>\nhappened because I knew how upset she&#39;d be.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust saying - we got through it.  As hard as we try to do everything we <br/>\npossibly can for our kids, there will be frustrations and let-downs and <br/>\ndisappointments in life. Because these are inevitable, we don&#39;t need to <br/>\nmanufacture them by imposing &quot;natural consequences.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry you had to go through it - I know exactly how you feel when you <br/>\nlet down your little one! Maybe try to make up for it by doing something <br/>\nspecial for her.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287815876,"authorName":"Robyn L. Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn L.

They had met two Mondays from 1:30 to 3:00.  I thought I had read that the performance was at 3:00 today.  Instead, it was at 2:30 (only a 15 minute performance).  I had been sitting in the library with my 7 year old son waiting for the performance.  I saw a bunch of people exiting the room where the kids had been practicing and I had a bad bad feeling that I missed the performance (and I did).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI rushed into the room and my daughter was standing at the front crying because I had missed it.  Someone I know made a comment to me in a rude voice as I was rushing in which didn&#39;t help the situation.  Evidentally, she was the only child without someone there to watch it.  I feel so incredibly horrible.  I took her onto my lap and told her how sorry I was and how bad I felt.  I was in tears myself.  I have never missed any thing my children have been involved in. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe saving thing is that one of the librarians videotaped it and will put it on youtube and the fact that because the kids were behind curtains, she didn&#39;t know I wasn&#39;t there until afterwards, so it didn&#39;t affect her performing her lines.   But, that is no comfort to my daughter (or me).  She is a non reader right now and both of us worked hard getting her lines memorized (well, she memorized the lines, I coached her).  She is so disappointed in me, and I&#39;m so angry at myself for not thinking about checking to make sure of the time of the performance.  She&#39;s been sad all evening and tonight as I lay down with her she told me that she is still so sad that I wasn&#39;t there to watch her performance.  I honor that and know she needs that time to be sad and to be disappointed in me.  I&#39;m disappointed in myself. I let her down.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that from now on, I must be more diligent about double checking things and not assuming, but that&#39;s hind sight.
