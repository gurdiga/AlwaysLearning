I really <br/>\nthink you&#39;d like it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Many children and adults <br/>\nhave very strong gifts and interests that they&#39;d like to pursue, but limited <br/>\nresources, and, even more, procrastination or laziness keep them from <br/>\npursuing them.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any unschooling family it&#39;s the parents&#39; part to provide opportunities and <br/>\ninspiration.  I&#39;m not really picturing what would &quot;accelerate&quot; it and still <br/>\nkeep it in the realm of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy original question was where are the support groups in various states, or <br/>\nwhere is this written up on the internet, because I had never heard of it <br/>\nuntil the other day.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Accelerated Unschooling allows the parent to take control of <br/>\nthe motivation piece.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce parents have &quot;taken control&quot; of ANY piece, how is it then still learning <br/>\nat one&#39;s own pace ?  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;This is especially important for children who are <br/>\nGifted or Talented, but who often lack motivation. Accelerated Unschooling <br/>\nallows them to reach their potentials.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTell me more.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;My personal experience with Accelerated Unschooling has been particularly <br/>\ndramatic. I have fo have begun Accelerated <br/>\nUnschooling, they have excelled in all of their areas of giftedness &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat method were you using before &quot;accelerated unschooling&quot;?<br/>\nWere the children ever in school?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Accelerated Unschooling is becoming more popular. I attended a workshop <br/>\nwith <br/>\nits inventors, Conrad and Lydia Menapolit, in California, and it has changed <br/>\nour lives. We are hoping that Conrad and Lydia will be doing more workshops, <br/>\nbut they are presently in Austria writing a book about Accelerated <br/>\nUnschooling.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen and where was the workshop?  At a conference?<br/>\nI&#39;m really surprised I hadn&#39;t heard about it, so yes, please give me any <br/>\nresources you have so I can understand it, since I get VERY many inquiries <br/>\nfrom others about unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8749,"nextTopicId":8723}}
