Everytime you see it within your own<br/>\nvision, you&#39;re missing the child&#39;s vision.  Kids will do what they love<br/>\nto do, if given the freedom to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat they love may not look like anything schooly, or anything that you<br/>\nmight have expected.  What I&#39;ve come to understand, is that, there is<br/>\nlearning in everything!  What we do for enjoyment, the things we are<br/>\npassionate about, will create more learning than anything else.  Kids<br/>\nwho are happy will learn easier and better than kids who aren&#39;t, and<br/>\nkids who are trying to meet someone else&#39;s idea of what is happy making<br/>\nand good for them won&#39;t be learning as easy as they would if they were<br/>\ndoing it for themselves, for their own personal reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter&#39;s passion for fashion and make-up has led her to all kinds<br/>\nof learning, theatrical make-up, making her own clothing, cutting hair,<br/>\nstyling hair, dyeing hair, re-working old clothing, making hair<br/>\nassessories, and all that stuff is really the surface of what she&#39;s<br/>\nlearned.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther people may come along and say &quot;what about math?&quot;.  My answer is<br/>\nusually, &quot;what about it?&quot;.  She may not know algebraic formulas, but she<br/>\nknows how to use money and time, and cut and sew and match shapes to do<br/>\nso.  This is what she loves to do and she may do it for the rest of her<br/>\nlife and make a living out of it.  If that&#39;s the case, why would she<br/>\nneed to know what she&#39;ll never use?  And if she ever does need to, she&#39;s<br/>\npretty smart about figuring things out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Also, his brother is going into 11th grade and is fine.
