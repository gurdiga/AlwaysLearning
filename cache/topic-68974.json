Surely some of them have forgotten they&#39;re on here, and some are too busy to read it.   That still leaves a couple of thousand who are reading.  Few of those post, which is fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe moderators are wonderful people who volunteer their time to keep this discussion peaceful and on topic and true to the kind of unschooling that has worked well in very many of the families here.   There are lots of places for fluffy discussion and vague platitudes, but this has never been one of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nNew members are welcome, but please do read the page above and the links on it for new members, about posting, notes on the purpose of the list and some about John Holt, before posting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68947,"nextTopicId":68771}}
