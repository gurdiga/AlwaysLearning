Little things like that help you to see the life learning that happens every day from a family of all ages being together.”<br/>\n<br/>\nIt’s not easy.  it’s unlikely that everyone will be equally happy in any one moment, but with practice the parents get better at peace-keeping, and can get better at remembering that moments pass, and moods change, and that things that make things better are… better things. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nChoices that improve the general environment can become more habitual.  There will be frustrations in parents and children, but it’s how we see those, and characterize/name them, and respond, that will help us provide soft landings.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/nest\">http://sandradodd.com/nest</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf others want to contribute ideas and stories, please do—unschooling-experiences only though, please!
