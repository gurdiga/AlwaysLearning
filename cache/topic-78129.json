I see a reference back to 2007. It’s in the description of unschooling groups — spreading from one to another.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere’s a large group on Facebook started 2013 called Unschooling Spectrum.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/520274801369492/\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/520274801369492/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIn that context it means the spectrum between unschooling and radical unschooling. (I see a lot of familiar names on it.)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Where on the unschooling spectrum are you?

Some use unschooling concepts in their parenting as a whole and call themselves &quot;radical unschoolers&quot;, some are not radical unschoolers but educate completely as unschoolers, and some people are unschooling inspired, doing a mix of regular homeschooling and unschooling.”<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pennilessparenting.com/2016/09/what-unschooling-is-not-and-what-it-is.html\">http://www.pennilessparenting.com/2016/09/what-unschooling-is-not-and-what-it-is.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"&quot;the unschooling spectrum&quot;","postDate":"1499863400","msgId":78129,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQ4RjBEQzM2LUEwMjMtNDQwMi1CRTJDLUVCREU4RUFDQTZFRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":78133,"prevInTime":78128,"nextInTime":78130,"topicId":78129,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Whose term is this?

Where did this “unschooling spectrum” come from?<br/>\n<br/>\nI had been told several weeks ago that the term was out there, but I didn’t know it for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone applying to be in the group (and I hope she WILL join) wrote &quot;Although a complete surprise to me, we tend to be on the unschooling spectrum with our homeschool.

Their results won’t be good.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschool/marginal\">http://sandradodd.com/unschool/marginal</a><br/>\n<br/>\nQuotes from that page:<br/>\nSchuyler Waynforth:  &quot;Unschooling school is still about school and not really about life. It&#39;s not seeing how life is bigger and brighter and richer and shinier and more than school could ever hope to be and always about learning whatever tool it is you are using to explore it. “<br/>\n<br/>\nPam Sorooshian: &quot;I have a friend who used Calvert Curriculum on her kids. She called herself an unschooler because she didn&#39;t make them do it EXACTLY as required by Calvert. She&#39;d let them do two lessons on Monday and Wednesday, and they&#39;d take Tuesday and Thursday off, for example. And they&#39;d skip stuff that they didn&#39;t think was necessary.”<br/>\n<br/>\nThere’s more, there and here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/comparisons\">http://sandradodd.com/comparisons</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf people come here with rough or faulty ideas, I hope more experienced radical unschoolers will help them see how living with learning in all aspects of life creates something bigger, better and different than any partical-sorta-kinda unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/Fabric\">http://sandradodd.com/Fabric</a> (new page) <br/>\nwhich leads to <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/fabric\">http://sandradodd.com/fabric</a> <br/>\nand<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/substance\">http://sandradodd.com/substance</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78126,"nextTopicId":78134}}
