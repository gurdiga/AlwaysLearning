Unschooling takes a good bit of engagement with your kids. If you&#39;ve abandoned six children to their own devices for the winter, consider getting a mothers helper or some extra care for your baby so that you can spend more time with all of them, not just the sick one. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll that being said, many times &quot;failure&quot; is an overstatment to make a point. You want to avoid that sort of hyperbole in the future on this list as it confuses things! Its also good to examine, if you&#39;ve still been pretty engaged but just dropped academic stuff, why that leaves you feeling like a failure.

Like I can not meet any ones needs. We adopted our 7th child (preemie)in July of 2010 and she was very sick throughout the fall and winter with Pertussis. This narrowed my focus to only her left the others to &quot;educate&quot; themselves. &quot;They&quot; are doing great, but I have nothing for the portfolios, and I am a little panicked. I would love words of support or wisdom from large families who are choosing to unschool. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI let this through with my finger on the &quot;return&quot; button.
