Just live and love them and provide lots of info as they want it.  So<br/>\nI&#39;ve learned the hard way to quietly savor the &quot;wow&quot; moments and not spoil<br/>\nmy children&#39;s joy in learning when I realize they learned it totally<br/>\ndifferently than I did (less painstakingly, even!)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only big thing I&#39;ve done that I think has been helpful for my 14 year<br/>\nold is to share with him stories about other late readers that have been<br/>\nsuccessful in their chosen fields.

While sometimes we pull facts in, mainly we piece  <br/>\nthings together and make our own sense out of them. It would be a lot  <br/>\nmore efficient (for schools especially) if we naturally learned by  <br/>\nabsorbing someone else&#39;s understanding! But we don&#39;t. We need to make  <br/>\nour own connections, make our own sense of the world. (The way we  <br/>\nnaturally learn is way better! Natural learning allows us to come up  <br/>\nwith novel ways of using and understanding the world.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is why giving kids a rich environment is important for natural  <br/>\nlearning. Kids need to pull sounds and words (and everything else)  <br/>\nfrom various contexts, play with them, come up with theories about  <br/>\nhow they work, play some more.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut introducing sounds and words suggests there&#39;s a way -- and a need  <br/>\n-- to get those isolated, contextless pieces into kids. There isn&#39;t.  <br/>\nNatural learning doesn&#39;t work that way. Natural learning needs the  <br/>\nwhole picture and the child will pull out whatever pieces intrigue  <br/>\nhim. The context is just as important as the pieces.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrograms like Sesame Street and Between the Lions (and I&#39;m assuming  <br/>\nLeap Frog) can be useful when they&#39;re like other things, swirling  <br/>\nthrough kids&#39; lives to pay attention to or not as the interest  <br/>\nstrikes them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with introducing programs to a child wanting to read  <br/>\n(especially an older child) is that they seem like systems to learn  <br/>\nto read. If his brain isn&#39;t ready yet, if he learns differently, if  <br/>\nphonics doesn&#39;t make sense to him, they&#39;ll just frustrate him and  <br/>\nmake him feel dumb.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we could teach kids to read, schools wouldn&#39;t be struggling with  <br/>\nit. There would be a handful of programs and the kids would be  <br/>\nmatched up with the program that fit their need and there you&#39;d go!  <br/>\nWhat maintains the illusion that reading can be taught is that the  <br/>\nlessons come at the time kids are naturally figuring reading out  <br/>\n(which we only know from unschooled kids!) Sometimes kids are  <br/>\npuzzling something out in their subconscious and a fact from a  <br/>\nprogram might provide the missing piece and they get an &quot;Aha!&quot;  <br/>\nmoment. And schools redefine what reading is to match what they can  <br/>\nget kids to do. While we might (rightly) define reading as picking up  <br/>\nsomething you want to read and extracting meaning from it, schools  <br/>\nget to define it in a way that they can say &quot;Yes, this child is on  <br/>\nthe path to reading.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] learning to read at 12","postDate":"1255378365","msgId":47926,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVGRUIyNTI0LUIwMUMtNEFERC04QkFFLUIzMjE1M0E1NDhBQkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDcwMjQ4NS40OTUwLnFtQHdlYjExMDQxNi5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDcwMjQ4NS40OTUwLnFtQHdlYjExMDQxNi5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":47925,"nextInTopic":47927,"prevInTime":47925,"nextInTime":47927,"topicId":47907,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"When I taught reading in ancient days, to 7th graders (12, 13 years old, some 14 because they had failed a grade or two, poor guys), there were books with a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-596822706\">When I taught reading in ancient days, to 7th graders (12, 13 years  <br/>\nold, some 14 because they had failed a grade or two, poor guys), there  <br/>\nwere books with a &quot;second grade reading level&quot; (short words, short  <br/>\nsentences) and teen interest level.

She learned by her own combination of <br/>\nwhole word recognition, memorization and checking, guessing/working out <br/>\nwords from the context after recognizing the first letter, and maybe, maybe <br/>\na tiny, tiny bit of sounding out.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is much more likely now to try sounding out an unfamiliar word to see <br/>\nhow it might fit into her impressive spoken vocabulary, than when she was <br/>\nfirst beginning the process. What I find very interesting is that she has <br/>\ntold me that she finds reading aloud easier than silent reading, so I guess <br/>\nI will be able to call her a proficient reader once I start seeing her <br/>\nreading silently.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat did I do to help?<br/>\n<br/>\nProvided masses of entertaining and interesting print material including <br/>\ncomputer games.<br/>\n<br/>\nRead anything she wanted me to when she said, &quot;What does this say?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRead the books aloud that she likes over and over. At the moment her <br/>\nfavorites are The Sisters Grimm and Nancy Drew stories. She told me that she <br/>\nwants me to read them many times over to her so that she will find it easier <br/>\nto recognize the words when she comes to read them for herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout accepting the state of non-reading: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://familyrun.ning.com/profiles/blogs/2184370:BlogPost:21737\">http://familyrun.ning.com/profiles/blogs/2184370:BlogPost:21737</a><br/>\n&quot;When Jayn Reads&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Reading is a part of the whole wide world and that seems to be the way the show works in general with all the cool stuff they present.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of my kids have enjoyed Sesame Street.  I was very disappointed when friends of Chamille dissed Sesame Street in front of Margaux.  We would ask them to stop, but it didn&#39;t change the fact that they did and caused Margaux to feel silly and little to like it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJohn&#39;s grandpa was a teacher for a while.  He always told parents that their kids would be better off staying home and watching Sesame Street at the age of 5, 6, and 7, rather than going to school.  He also always said that 8th grade was a complete waste of time and that all kids should skip that year.  His kids did.  It&#39;s always been the review year, it still may be.  He was very supportive of our family homeschooling.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] learning to read at 12","postDate":"1255374602","msgId":47921,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERCM0YwRkVCLTExREQtNEFGNS04NDg5LTczRkVFN0VEMzVCOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDk4OTI4Ny4zMDIyMS5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDYubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDk4OTI4Ny4zMDIyMS5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDYubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47920,"nextInTopic":47922,"prevInTime":47920,"nextInTime":47922,"topicId":47907,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I told her that my oldest reads manga, when she wants a good story, and this woman who teaches and interacts on a daily basis with kids 11-14 had never","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1868704170\">-=-I told her that my oldest reads manga, when she wants a good story,  <br/>\nand this woman who teaches and interacts on a daily basis with kids  <br/>\n11-14 had never heard of it.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI made an involuntary kind of eeeek sound down in my throat when I  <br/>\nread that!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I know that kids in elementary school jump through all kinds of  <br/>\n&quot;fun&quot; activities to get them to read.

In some  <br/>\nfamilies when music, books, and programs are defined and sorted into  <br/>\n&quot;kids&#39; shows&quot; and &quot;not for kids,&quot; it does make it harder for older  <br/>\nkids to learn things (for younger kids too, I think).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Holly was little and Kirby and Marty were just starting to read,  <br/>\nsometimes I&#39;d play &quot;Sounds Like Fun&quot; and if one of them started to  <br/>\nobject, I might say, &quot;It would be nice for Holly, though, to learn  <br/>\nthose songs.&quot;  And I know my kids can still sing some of the songs on  <br/>\nthe CD.  They were painless.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was a little kid I had a horribly difficult time learning the  <br/>\ndays of the week.  I worked at it for a couple of years when I was  <br/>\nsix, seven, eight, always confusing Tuesday and Thursday.  Years after  <br/>\nthat my mom told me a story that made me sad and simultaneously pissed  <br/>\nme off.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she was little her mom had taught her the days of the week by  <br/>\nsinging them to the tune of Yankee Doodle.  If you sing the whole tune  <br/>\n(verse and chorus), you&#39;ve sung four weeks--a month.<br/>\n<br/>\nDAMN IT!!!!! I could have learned it that way when I was three years  <br/>\nold.  WHY didn&#39;t she sing that to me?<br/>\nHere&#39;s why:  She was singing it to herself at school one day at recess  <br/>\nor out at lunch, on the playground, in the late 1930&#39;s, and the  <br/>\nteacher thought it was wonderful, and asked her to sing it for the  <br/>\nclass when she came in.  My mom was mortified.  If I could go back  <br/>\nbefore I was born and talk to those people I would have, on behalf of  <br/>\nthe me yet to come, asked the teacher if she couldn&#39;t sing it to the  <br/>\nkids herself and not put my poor little tow-headed seven-year-old  <br/>\nmother up in front of the class.  She had enough problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo all my kids learned the days of the week by me singing them, to  <br/>\nYankee Doodle, while I brushed their teeth, or when we were counting  <br/>\nsomething down like holding the gas handle down to light the pilot  <br/>\nlight on the furnace, or waiting for something to heat up in the  <br/>\nmicrowave.  And the joke would be &quot;I&#39;m going to sing two months!&quot; and  <br/>\nsing it twice, or &quot;one month&quot; and sing it through, four lines.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings like that are playing, not teaching.  But some families, I  <br/>\nthink, throw the information baby out with the schoolish bathwater.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] learning to read at 12","postDate":"1255373889","msgId":47919,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk4OTI4Ny4zMDIyMS5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDYubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47918,"nextInTopic":47920,"prevInTime":47918,"nextInTime":47920,"topicId":47907,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Just to clarify - Frog Leap videos are cartoons - they are not reading programs - they are storylines which explain phonics in a cartoon way - just like the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1497201645\">***Just to clarify - Frog Leap videos are cartoons - they are not reading programs - they are storylines which explain phonics in a cartoon way - just like the pbs cartoon Between the Lions - and maybe a twelve year old might think they are too young - but for others they may be a great way to introduce sounds and words - The videos mentioned are not tricks to get kids to do things - schools would most likely not show kids cartoons about reading - since they&#39;d be considered something other than schooling.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m familiar with this style of kid&#39;s toys/learning/educational material.  I know it&#39;s not a reading program, but it&#39;s cleverly designed to sneak in reading lessons, in an appealing way to small children.  Many kids enjoy these things, even mine did.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was visiting another family once, and they had other guests over.  One of them was a middle school teacher.  She said something like &quot;as long as they are reading, whatever it takes to keep them reading&quot;, as if that was the only issue in regards to reading, just written word.  I was thinking, &quot;what, no fun?  No reading for a need or for pleasure or any of that?&quot; because the idea was that as long as the kids are reading then all must be good with the world.  I told her that my oldest reads manga, when she wants a good story, and this woman who teaches and interacts on a daily basis with kids 11-14 had never heard of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that kids in elementary school jump through all kinds of &quot;fun&quot; activities to get them to read.  Games and pictures and all kinds of reading exercises designed to &quot;feel&quot; like play are forced on kids everyday.  Toy companies that create toys for the younger kids have made millions of baby toys with the alphabet all mixed in.  Why do babies need to familiarize themselves with the alphabet?

Schools are not exception to that mode of thinking.  What they do, is make it &quot;official&quot;.  No need to wear a mask to disguise what they do, but  many classrooms try to make all that stuff &quot;fun&quot;.<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\nI</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":283974978,"authorName":"Erika Grova-Silva","from":"Erika Grova-Silva &lt;egsmft@...&gt;","profile":"egsmft","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] learning to read at 12","postDate":"1255371550","msgId":47918,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyODU4My4yMTc0NC5xbUB3ZWI1NTMwMi5tYWlsLnJlNC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDMzMjg2MS41NzczOS5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MTEubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47917,"nextInTopic":47919,"prevInTime":47917,"nextInTime":47919,"topicId":47907,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Just to clarify - Frog Leap videos are cartoons - they are not reading programs - they are storylines which explain phonics in a cartoon way - just like the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-975693641\">Just to clarify - Frog Leap videos are cartoons - they are not reading programs - they are storylines which explain phonics in a cartoon way - just like the pbs cartoon Between the Lions - and maybe a twelve year old might think they are too young - but for others they may be a great way to introduce sounds and words - The videos mentioned are not tricks to get kids to do things - schools would most likely not show kids cartoons about reading - since they&#39;d be considered something other than schooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nErika Grova-Silva<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Mon, 10/12/09, Jenny Cyphers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jenstarc4@...\">jenstarc4@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Jenny Cyphers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jenstarc4@...\">jenstarc4@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] learning to read at 12<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Monday, October 12, 2009, 10:58 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n                  &gt;&gt;&gt;It teaches kids the sound of each letter in 1st video and then how to put the sounds together in the second one - and they are very entertaining and fun. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that is the wrong direction to go with an older child that is frustrated already with someone else trying to teach them to sound things out.  Entertaining and fun are great!  Both of my kids have done various reading things online and via games and such and have enjoyed it.  There wasn&#39;t a goal to get them to read though.  That can be extremely problematic.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchools use tricks like that to get kids to do all kinds of things.  It doesn&#39;t do much to help kids learn better, it only makes the medicine go down easier with that little bit of sugar.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that, kids all learn differently.  So, something of that nature may be very frustrating to a child that doesn&#39;t process the written word in that manner.  My oldest daughter didn&#39;t learn how to read that way at all!  She collected words and eventually she had enough words collected to read most anything.  That happened when she was about 11/12.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t <br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] learning to read at 12","postDate":"1255371218","msgId":47917,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRGMjdBQkUxLUI4OEEtNDMxRi1CQkQyLTg5MDdBMjc2RDVEMEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDExMTU2Mi40OTE4NS5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDMubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDExMTU2Mi40OTE4NS5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDMubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47916,"nextInTopic":47918,"prevInTime":47916,"nextInTime":47918,"topicId":47907,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Poor Jenny and her computer day.
