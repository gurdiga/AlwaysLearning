I<br/>\nhappend to love dogs and have always had dogs.  And I am always kind of<br/>\nsurprised when I meet people who don&#39;t.  That said, my 10 yr old son did<br/>\nnot inherit the dog gene -- he likes fish and that&#39;s it, nothing with<br/>\nfur or feathers.  One of his friends, though, started wanting a dog and<br/>\nwanting to spend time with our dog (Great Pyrenees).  He worked and<br/>\nworked on his mother, who also did not inherit the dog gene, until<br/>\nfinally, after I think three years, he talked her into a puppy for<br/>\nChristmas.  She never, ever owned a dog before.  She was in for some<br/>\nchanges, that&#39;s for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis little boy is in school, so he&#39;s not home during the day to take<br/>\ncare of the puppy.  His mom has to do it, and I think she resents it. <br/>\nPuppy is now six months old and recently ate part of their grill and<br/>\npart of something on their air conditioner.  This tells me Puppy is not<br/>\nbeing watched as well as needed and places aren&#39;t puppyproof.  Mom&#39;s<br/>\nresponse is to put the pup in her carrier -- time out, I guess.  She<br/>\ncalls me often upset and angry about whatever is going on.  I try to<br/>\ntell her about phases and training, etc.  She really does resent the<br/>\npuppy, though, and I seriously doubt they have her much longer.  BTW,<br/>\nthey paid $600 for this pup who is just being a pup.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if that helps you any.  My friend is still trying to adjust<br/>\nto the extra cost of just one little puppy -- monthly flea/tick<br/>\ntreatment, heartworm, food plus any vet visits, grooming, toys,<br/>\nbedding...  My dog, who is big, costs about 40 a month for those<br/>\npreventative treatments, probably another 50 in food and her upcoming<br/>\ncheckup is going to be about $130.  I TRY to groom her -- not fun, even<br/>\nto me -- because taking her to be done would be upwards of $200.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you think your daughter is responsible/capable of all the home needs<br/>\n- feeding, watering daily, training, cleaning up potty messes/yard,<br/>\nexercising, etc., then no problem (I did do all that stuff, except for<br/>\nthe yard cleanup, when I was that age).  But if not, maybe you two could<br/>\npick a breed  (www.dogbreedinfo.com &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dogbreedinfo.com\">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com</a>&gt;   <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://animal.discovery.com/breedselector/dogselectorindex.do\">http://animal.discovery.com/breedselector/dogselectorindex.do</a><br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://animal.discovery.com/breedselector/dogselectorindex.do\">http://animal.discovery.com/breedselector/dogselectorindex.do</a>&gt;    <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dogbreed.com/\">http://www.dogbreed.com/</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dogbreed.com/\">http://www.dogbreed.com/</a>&gt; )  and get some<br/>\nbooks on that breed, some dog training books, maybe observe a training<br/>\nclass somewhere - Petsmart has them - and let her learn all about it<br/>\nbefore she gets her dog.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I think older dogs are great, many are not the best option for a<br/>\nbeginner.  Some are really set in their ways, have health issues, may<br/>\nnot like kids (you won&#39;t always get a history on an oder dog).  I like<br/>\nthat my son, even though he doesn&#39;t care about dogs, has been around our<br/>\ndog since he was three years old and she was 9 weeks.  She adores him<br/>\nand loves my toddler, too.  Growing up together, to me, is ideal for<br/>\nkids and their dogs.

I&#39;d love to see more parents go out of<br/>\ntheir way to  help their children make their dreams come true.  I just want<br/>\nto point out that lack of money, time, and willingness are not always a cop<br/>\nout.  Getting a dog IS a big responsibility and it has to be the right<br/>\ndecision for your whole family.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRight now my daughter wants a dog.  We have 2 horses, 2 cats, and 2 rabbits.<br/>\nWe love and take good care of all of our pets and it can be expensive.  Last<br/>\nfall one of our horses got Lyme disease and we are now suffering the fallout<br/>\nfrom that as she has now developed arthritis from having Lyme.  Proper vet<br/>\ncare is expensive.  Had the vet out the other day for her and it was $450<br/>\nand we still don&#39;t know if what they did helped her.  For my family, adding<br/>\na dog to our expenses right now would, imo, be irresponsible because we&#39;re<br/>\nalready on a tight budget and the pets we have already are not inexpensive<br/>\nto keep.  A dog is a whole different level than a gerbil or hamster.  They<br/>\nare pack animals that want to be part of your family and vet care can be<br/>\nexpensive.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I am writing all this is because I don&#39;t think other mom&#39;s out<br/>\nthere should feel like being responsible is a cop out if the time is not<br/>\nright for them to add a dog to the family.  I hate seeing all the unwanted<br/>\ndogs in shelters when their families give them up because they did not<br/>\nconsider all the responsibilities connected with bringing home a puppy.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Animals WAS Responsibility","postDate":"1209649749","msgId":34598,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExMjc4RTczLTAxNkQtNEU4Ny1CQTFDLTJGNDI4QTREM0M1N0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGZ2YnFibithanA4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZ2YnFibithanA4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":34596,"nextInTopic":34602,"prevInTime":34597,"nextInTime":34599,"topicId":34571,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I am not a big fan of this idea because I am really not that fond of dogs and her dad *really* doesn t like them so it would have to be me (or will it?

Puppies are a LOT of<br/>\nwork.  They require more care, money, training, and attention than a 7 year<br/>\nold can provide and at this time in your life you do not feel ready for a<br/>\npuppy.  It would not be fair to the puppy to bring them into a family where<br/>\nthe primary care taker felt resentment towards the work/money required to<br/>\ncare for it properly.  Without the whole family being on board it just isn&#39;t<br/>\na good idea.
