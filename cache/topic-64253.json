That may be where you&#39;re going wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling will most often look like play, especially when kids are young. It can look like staring at the ceiling. It can look like kids having fun. It can look like trying things out. It can look like experimenting. It can look like being curious. <br/>\n<br/>\nExcept for the 1st 3, the words describing what unschooling looks like are also used in school. But the words mean something different in school. What you want to look for are the original meanings without the school overlay.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn school experimenting refers to science class. (And drugs!) In real life it can be anything. Banging on pots. Telling lies. Changing story lines during play. Seeing what changes when different choices are made in video games. Pouring and immersing and splashing in a bubble bath. It&#39;s all about &quot;What happens if ...?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing curious in school means paying attention to what&#39;s being taught and asking questions. In real life, it&#39;s asking questions about *anything*. When&#39;s Daddy coming home. When&#39;s Pokemon on? What&#39;s *that*??? (on the dinner plate ;-) Why does Sammy hate me?
