Don&#39;t let the government prevent us from<br/>\nhaving access to safe toys, carriers and clothes for our children and<br/>\nput countless small American toy and baby product makers out of<br/>\nbusiness. Many safe European toy companies such as Selecta and Kathe<br/>\nKruse have already begun to make plans to stop selling their toys in<br/>\nthe U.S. Don&#39;t allow the big toy companies to dominate the market with<br/>\nall their Chinese made toys.

Don&#39;t don&#39;t wait this needs to be done immediately as<br/>\nthey are meeting to finalize this week.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelp Save Handmade Toys in the USA from the CPSIA<br/>\nThe issue:<br/>\nIn 2007, large toy manufacturers who outsource their production to<br/>\nChina and other developing countries violated the public&#39;s trust. They<br/>\nwere selling toys with dangerously high lead content, toys with unsafe<br/>\nsmall part, toys with improperly secured and easily swallowed small<br/>\nmagnets, and toys made from chemicals that made kids sick. Almost<br/>\nevery problem toy in 2007 was made in China.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe United States Congress rightly recognized that the Consumer<br/>\nProducts Safety Commission (CPSC) lacked the authority and staffing to<br/>\nprevent dangerous toys from being imported into the US. So, they<br/>\npassed the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cpsc.gov/ABOUT/Cpsia/cpsia.htmlin\">http://www.cpsc.gov/ABOUT/Cpsia/cpsia.htmlin</a> August, 2008. Among<br/>\nother things, the CPSIA bans lead and phthalates in toys, mandates<br/>\nthird-party testing and certification for all toys and requires toy<br/>\nmakers to permanently label each toy with a date and batch number.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of these changes will be fairly easy for large, multinational toy<br/>\nmanufacturers to comply with. Large manufacturers who make thousands<br/>\nof units of each toy have very little incremental cost to pay for<br/>\ntesting and update their molds to include batch labels.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor small American, Canadian, and European toymakers, however, the<br/>\ncosts of mandatroy testing will likely drive them out of business.<br/>\n<br/>\n* A toymaker, for example, who makes wooden cars in his garage in<br/>\nMaine to supplement his income cannot afford the $4,000 fee per toy<br/>\nthat testing labs are charging to assure compliance with the CPSIA.<br/>\n* A work at home mom in Minnesota who makes dolls to sell at craft<br/>\nfairs must choose either to violate the law or cease operations.<br/>\n* A small toy retailer in Vermont who imports wooden toys from<br/>\nEurope, which has long had stringent toy safety standards, must now<br/>\npay for testing on every toy they import.<br/>\n* And even the handful of larger toy makers who still employ<br/>\nworkers in the United States face increased costs to comply with the<br/>\nCPSIA, even though American-made toys had nothing to do with the toy<br/>\nsafety problems of 2007.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe CPSIA simply forgot to exclude the class of toys that have earned<br/>\nand kept the public&#39;s trust: Toys made in the US, Canada, and Europe.<br/>\nThe result, unless the law is modified, is that handmade toys will no<br/>\nlonger be legal in the US.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this law had been applied to the food industry, every farmers<br/>\nmarket in the country would be forced to close while Kraft and Dole<br/>\nprospered.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow You can Help:<br/>\nPlease write to your United States Congress Person<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://writerep.house.gov/writerep/welcome.shtml\">https://writerep.house.gov/writerep/welcome.shtml</a> and Senator<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm\">http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm</a> to<br/>\nrequest changes in the CPSIA to save handmade toys.
