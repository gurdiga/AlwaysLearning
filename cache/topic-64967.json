I worked there as the admin so I was around all day<br/>\nand could pop in and out of the classroom and be available as needed.  I<br/>\nlearned a lot about respectful parenting, how to handle conflicts, how to<br/>\nlisten.  The wiki entry is pretty much spot on for the school my boys went<br/>\nto, other than the hundred languages part.  It really was an amazing school<br/>\nand the boys still remember it fondly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do wish we had moved straight to unschooling after that but I had no idea<br/>\nunschooling existed.  I wasn&#39;t able to extrapolate out to that and went<br/>\nstraight into the typical school route which really sucked for my guys.<br/>\n After things progressively became worse and I started looking into<br/>\nalternate methods of learning, unschooling really stood out.  It made me<br/>\nthink of the Regio Emilia approach and that&#39;s why we ended up unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis started off being a response about preschools, but has turned into a<br/>\ngratitude note.  So, thanks to all the unschooling contributers who have<br/>\nhelped me on my journey.
