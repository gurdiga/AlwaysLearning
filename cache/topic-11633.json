My <br/>\ndd is 10, and was always considered &quot;gifted&quot; .  I pulled her out of a <br/>\nhorribly backwards school here in Boonville MO, after we moved here <br/>\nfrom Dallas, TX.  (talk about culture shock!)  Anyway, what she <br/>\nmostly loves to do is stay on the computer...role playing, reading <br/>\ncomics, game sites, anime sites, oekaki sites....She is teaching <br/>\nherself Japanese, as well...she sings Japanese anime songe, and has a <br/>\nJap/Eng dictionary that I got her for Xmas that she just LOVES.  <br/>\nPeople say &quot;all she does all day is sit at the computer&quot;  But I know <br/>\nhow much she is actually learning.  The other day we were visiting a <br/>\nsite that was very wordy...She read it aloud over and over, looking <br/>\nup the hard words she didn&#39;t know like &#39;cogitate&#39; <br/>\nand &#39;sporogonically&#39; and &#39;lethiferous&#39; .  And they don&#39;t see learning <br/>\nin that????  <br/>\n<br/>\nI love unschooling!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAngie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":779600,"authorName":"KathrynJB@aol.com","from":"KathrynJB@...","profile":"kathrynbeth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Only an Unschooler","postDate":"1042300928","msgId":11633,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExOS4xZDc5M2E4ZC4yYjUxOWEwMEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":11635,"prevInTime":11632,"nextInTime":11634,"topicId":11633,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/11/2003 9:58:19 AM Eastern Standard Time, ...
