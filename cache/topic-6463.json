We&#39;ve been home schooling our children for 5 years.<br/>\nThis<br/>\nyear we enrolled them in Einstein Academy, and it was a disaster.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore considering The Grace Academy, you should know that Mimi and Howie<br/>\nare<br/>\nEinstein&#39;s founders. Their company, Tutorbots, mismanaged the school<br/>\nuntil about<br/>\nthree weeks ago. In her dealings with Einstein families, Mimi used the name<br/>\nMimi Rothschild.<br/>\n<br/>\nIEP&#39;s were not done for the 300 special ed children who were enrolled in the<br/>\nschool. It is now the end of April and only nine IEP&#39;s have been written.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I have never seen a more substantive fundamental violation of<br/>\nspecial education<br/>\nby a local education agency,&quot; charged Jane Sullivan, special education<br/>\nadviser<br/>\nfor the education department, who testified against Einstein Academy.<br/>\nCourier<br/>\nTimes 3/20/02<br/>\n<br/>\nThe curriculum was not what Einstein promised. One class didn&#39;t have a<br/>\nteacher<br/>\nuntil early Dec - then he left the school in February, and the class<br/>\nis teacherless<br/>\nagain.<br/>\n<br/>\nEinstein has been sued by many PA school districts and the PA Department of<br/>\nEducation. It is only open now through a court-brokered agreement<br/>\nwhich required:<br/>\neliminating Tutorbots as manager and financial manager of the school,<br/>\nforensic<br/>\naccounting of payments to Tutorbots, approval of all payments by a<br/>\ncomptroller<br/>\nwho reports to the chartering school district and strict oversight by<br/>\nthe chartering<br/>\nschool district.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are excerpts from articles about Tutorbots and its mismanagement<br/>\nof Einstein:<br/>\n<br/>\n************<br/>\n<br/>\nI am convinced that Einstein will not be successful as long as Tutorbots is<br/>\nthe management company,&quot; Ken Junkins, the Morrisville board president, said<br/>\nyesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I believe Tutorbots is not properly managing Einstein. I believe<br/>\nthere is possible<br/>\nmismanagement of funds, and they are not responding appropriately to the<br/>\nneeds<br/>\nof students,&quot; he said.<br/>\nCourier Times 2/28/02<br/>\n<br/>\n**************<br/>\nWe believe they (Tutorbots) totally mishandled the management of the<br/>\nschool.&quot;<br/>\nSaid Morrisville Superintendent John M. Gould.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe school board, Gould said, is particularly concerned about<br/>\nTutorbots&#39; general<br/>\noperation of the school, a lack of fiscal oversight and problems<br/>\nproviding services<br/>\nto special education students.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother source of Morrisville&#39;s ire: Einstein&#39;s teachers haven&#39;t been<br/>\npaid since<br/>\nearly February. &quot;We are quite angry at Tutorbots because they have used $2.3<br/>\nmillion to pay themselves but have not paid the teachers, &quot; Gould said.<br/>\n&quot;That&#39;s<br/>\nunconscionable.&quot;<br/>\nMorning Call 3/2/02<br/>\n<br/>\n***************<br/>\nCourt documents showed that about $3 million was paid to Tutorbots during<br/>\nthe<br/>\nschool year, while teachers have gone unpaid and the school&#39;s internet<br/>\nservice<br/>\nprovider, Digital Freedom, canceled its service for nonpayment.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther complaints include copyright infringement, a lack of curriculum<br/>\nand teachers<br/>\nand a lack of special education services.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring today&#39;s arguments, attorney Scher insisted that the state has<br/>\na responsibility<br/>\nto pay its bill owed the cyber school, some 15 million in all. The judge<br/>\nasked<br/>\nScher how the state would know that the money is not going to a bank in the<br/>\nCayman Islands.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut from day one they (the state) funded you and you did virtually nothing,&quot;<br/>\nJudge Pellegrini said. &quot;You are supposed to be up and running on day one,<br/>\nnot<br/>\nday 90 of a 180-day school year. In effect, you put Tutorbots over the<br/>\ninterest<br/>\nof the children you were supposed to educate.&quot;<br/>\nLancaster New Era 3/22/02<br/>\n<br/>\n****************<br/>\nGould believes Mandel and Rothschild are controlling much of the<br/>\nschool&#39;s spending.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Howie Mandel.had the responsibility for.approving all invoices,&quot; Gould<br/>\nclaimed<br/>\nin a letter to Einstein, including invoices from his own company, Tutorbots,<br/>\nand Gould said some of those invoices are &quot;grossly inflated&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this while other vendors, and even the school&#39;s teachers went unpaid.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Einstein paid Tutorbots $2.4 million before paying teachers,&quot; Gould said.<br/>\n<br/>\nWGAL 3/26/02<br/>\n<br/>\n*****************<br/>\n.our information is that Einstein has received $3.3 million from the<br/>\nCommonwealth<br/>\nof PA to fund its educational program. Our Business Administrator<br/>\ncannot conceive<br/>\nof any way that the funding to date would not be sufficient to allow<br/>\nEinstein<br/>\nto be current on its bills and meet payroll.<br/>\n<br/>\nMorrisville attorney<br/>\n<br/>\n*****************<br/>\nTutorbots Inc. is prohibited from providing any management or<br/>\nfinancial management<br/>\nservices to Einstein. In addition, a forensic accounting firm will review<br/>\nall<br/>\npaid and outstanding invoices previously submitted by Tutorbots to Einstein<br/>\nto determine if they were properly paid and that the funds were used<br/>\nfor purposes<br/>\npermitted under the Public School Code:<br/>\nPDE press release 3/28/02<br/>\n<br/>\n*****************<br/>\nIn June a forensic accounting firm will do an audit to determine whether the<br/>\npayments Einstein made to Tutorbots were warranted. A total of $2.2 million<br/>\nof $3.8 million in state funding that Einstein received went to Tutorbots,<br/>\nand<br/>\nthe state Education Department wants to know why, said Beth Gaydos, a<br/>\nspokeswoman<br/>\nfor the Education Department.<br/>\nCourier Times 4/4/02<br/>\n<br/>\n****************<br/>\nThe computer problems coincide with a new legal battle between Einstein and<br/>\nTutorbots, which is demanding the repayment of a loan of about $345,000.<br/>\n<br/>\nTutorbots officials, Howard Mandell and his wife, Mimi Rothschild, also the<br/>\nfounder of Einstein, have been withholding student records as well as<br/>\ncontrol<br/>\nof the school&#39;s web site, until the money is repaid.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast week, a judge in Philadelphia ordered the return of the records as well<br/>\nas the web site, but as of Tuesday that had not happened.<br/>\nIntelligencer Journal 4/10/02<br/>\n<br/>\n*****************<br/>\n<br/>\nTutorbot&#39;s mismanagement turned what could have been a great cyber school<br/>\ninto<br/>\na disaster which damaged children enrolled.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou should exercise great caution before considering The Grace Academy!<br/>\n<br/>\nBuyer Beware!<br/>\nElizabeth Stone<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis email may be reproduced in its entirety and posted where appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
