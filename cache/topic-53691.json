If your daughter isn&#39;t worried about losing friends, then it might be fine for her to go ahead with her exploration (if you can also be fine with it... I did see that bit about your concerns about New Age stuff). And if she is worried about losing friends, then perhaps you can help her explore discreet ways to pursue this interest (I think suggestions may have already been given).<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s 14. She&#39;ll soon be at the age where she&#39;ll explore this without your support if she really wants to (maybe she&#39;s already there).

That&#39;s what I did from the moment I gave birth to the most unique child I had ever known...one who went SO completely *against the grain* of mainstream. And that&#39;s what I continue to do in all that they express an interest in. Because when I shut out what *others* say, and when I do the work to move past my own preconceived judgments and definitions, I see Their Joy, Their True Interest, and my world is greatly expanded.

What Diana said about historically following Christianity is pretty accurate in learning about Paganism.  My basic understanding is that Paganism is anything that isn&#39;t monotheistic, and that&#39;s the basic underlying factor.  The Greeks fit that category and so did the Celts, and probably all the people who practiced Hinduism were considered Pagan.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn its modern day form, it encompasses anyone who isn&#39;t following a monotheistic religious practice.

So there is already some support within your community for these kinds of beliefs and practices.<br/>\n<br/>\nCara wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I have mixed, uncomfortable feelings about paganism.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just wondering why you have uncomfortable feelings about paganism. My understanding is that it is a belief system based on reverence for nature and female power. Nothing to do with so-called devil worship.<br/>\n<br/>\nCara wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I have a pretty low tolerance for new-age kinds of thinking ...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, I&#39;m no expert, but my understanding is that paganism is a very old system of belief.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand your concerns about your daughter being ostracised for her interest in paganism - it&#39;s hard when as unschoolers you are already in a tiny minority. But she is a teenage girl exploring different ideas as her worldview broadens. An interest in a certain belief system now doesn&#39;t mean she will adopt it wholesale for the rest of her life. Supporting these explorations shows her that her interests are important to you. As with any other strongly-held belief on the part of the parents, I think the best thing to remember is that those are your beliefs, not necessarily your children&#39;s. Living by your principles without foisting them on others is the best way to demonstrate their worth.<br/>\n<br/>\nClaire</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] teens and religion","postDate":"1272753921","msgId":53692,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg3ODVDQzg4LTU1NzYtNDU2RC04QjBFLTJEMzU5QzU1RTMwMkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PHkyajdhMDlmNDFmMTAwNTAxMTUyNHpiNzc3MWI1ZG44ZTU0YjQxMWMyZjYxZjk0QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PHkyajdhMDlmNDFmMTAwNTAxMTUyNHpiNzc3MWI1ZG44ZTU0YjQxMWMyZjYxZjk0QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":53691,"nextInTopic":53695,"prevInTime":53691,"nextInTime":53693,"topicId":53691,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- She s very aware that not everyone is accepting of paganism.

She&#39;s been reading about<br/>\nit and I&#39;m taking her to a local festival so she can check things out.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe comes by this interest naturally enough - I love learning about<br/>\ndifferent faiths. We attend a UU church, and she&#39;s acquainted with some<br/>\npagan adults in the church.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have mixed, uncomfortable feelings about paganism.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s the first situation where I can&#39;t whole-heartedly endorse one of her<br/>\ninterests. I have a pretty low tolerance for new-age kinds of thinking and I<br/>\nwant to protect her from negative fallout from some of our more conventional<br/>\nfriends. It&#39;s not as easy as if she were expressing an interest in<br/>\nChristianity or Judaism. &lt;g&gt;  On the other hand, I also don&#39;t want to squash<br/>\nher curiosity - if she&#39;s interested I want to support that interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s very aware that not everyone is accepting of paganism.

I think the part that<br/>\nmakes me most nervous about this for her is that she might be ostracized by<br/>\nsome of her friends (or more likely her friend&#39;s parents) if they found out<br/>\nshe was pagan or even dabbling in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - please let me know if you have any thoughts.
