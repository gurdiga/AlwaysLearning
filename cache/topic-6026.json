They never<br/>\ncome to feeders in town but the country folks put bluebird houses on<br/>\ntheir fence posts and they move right in. The county also has a bluebird<br/>\nprogram and puts up houses for them.   They are revered here for their<br/>\nbug eating habits, although  Starlings eat just as many and no one likes<br/>\nthem (except me).   A family of Starlings  single handedly saved my<br/>\ngolden willow during a sever infestation of tent caterpillars two years<br/>\nago.  Many of our neighbors lost their trees.  It pays to build a<br/>\nStarling house, or two.  <br/>\n <br/>\nNot technically  bluebirds, we get Lazuli Buntings here at our feeders in<br/>\nthe summer and noisy  Blue Jays.  We also get Stellar&#39;s Jays,  (bluish<br/>\nblack) who mimic hawks so they can clear all the little birds out of the<br/>\nfeeders and have them to themselves.  Pretty slick.<br/>\n<br/>\nI once had a Conure I inherited from my niece.  He was charming,<br/>\naffectionate and talkative but would start screaming when the &#39;phone rang<br/>\nand continue through out the conversation.   Now I just have a pigeon. <br/>\nHe has lovely telephone manners but he does pinch. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6020,"nextTopicId":6030}}
