It&#39;s a paradigm that I&#39;m applying. I don&#39;t think I could apply those principles if Simon and Linnaea were in school, but I do believe I could frame what we do in such a way as to meet the requirements of a government programme. I believe that I can bend and fold what we do to make it look like it fits in a box if so required. My beliefs haven&#39;t been tested, but I know other people who have done that without much difficulty. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n From: Tawha &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tawha@...\">tawha@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Tuesday, 18 September 2012, 1:00<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Are you still an unschooler when you go to school?<br/>\n <br/>\nI have been in a discussion about a different topic over at the radical unschooling  that is unquestionable related to the same thing if not is a big part of it..<br/>\nhere it raised these two questions:<br/>\n- are you still an Unschooler when you go to school?( what about goverment programs which are not go to school but, you are part of the system which it doesnt go to school but, some requirements are applied and expected)<br/>\n- when do you stop being an unschooler?!<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Are you still an unschooler when you go to school?","postDate":"1347924384","msgId":69097,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRFMzI5MkQ2LUQxRUItNDI0OS04RjlFLUUwQTQ1ODhDODA2NkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGszN2R1bit2aGV0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGszN2R1bit2aGV0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69094,"nextInTopic":69098,"prevInTime":69096,"nextInTime":69098,"topicId":69092,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-- are you still an Unschooler when you go to school?( what about goverment programs which are not go to school but, you are part of the system which it","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1488376412\">-=-- are you still an Unschooler when you go to school?( what about goverment programs which are not go to school but, you are part of the system which it doesnt go to school but, some requirements are applied and expected)-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you&#39;re looking for ammunition to use in a local-group discussion, and I&#39;m not sure why.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo what you want to do with your family, for good reasons.

They do some AMAZING things with that money!  There is no question in my mind that they are an unschooling family.  The kids love being able to decide what to do with their money throughout the year and the tiny bits of paper work and oversight are not a deterrent at all to the huge benefit they get from having that money at their disposal.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are places in the world where we wouldn&#39;t even be able to have this conversation.  I honestly believe that the more options available to families in regards to education, the better for everyone, including traditional public schoolers.  It sets a higher standard of education and puts it clearly in the hands of parents which isn&#39;t a bad thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a family is fully invested in public school, or school, or are emotionally or physically abusive, I don&#39;t think they can really call themselves an unschooler or an unschooling family.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Are you still an unschooler when you go to school?","postDate":"1347914830","msgId":69093,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk0OUNENTg2LUYzQzgtNDQ2Qi04NUM2LUY1OTE3Qjg3RjczMkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGszN2R1bit2aGV0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGszN2R1bit2aGV0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69092,"nextInTopic":69094,"prevInTime":69092,"nextInTime":69094,"topicId":69092,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

There are parents who are using the unschooling philosophy to create an atmosphere in their home that supports kids learning through their interests. And there are kids who are living and learning in that environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nWanting to hold onto the label of unschooler while in school sounds like a need to separate yourself from those who don&#39;t have a choice about being there. Using &quot;unschooler&quot; while someone is in school just muddies the definition of unschooling, making it more difficult for new people to understand what it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a better term would be autodidact. An autodidact is a self-directed learner which encompasses whatever way they&#39;d like to learn.
