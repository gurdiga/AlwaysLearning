What I found easily was lame and over- <br/>\nsimplified.  So I went looking for what the language arts teachers  <br/>\nthemselves are saying these days, and found this:<br/>\n<br/>\nSTANDARD 3.5 ALL STUDENTS WILL VIEW, UNDERSTAND, AND USE NONTEXTUAL  <br/>\nVISUAL INFORMATION .<br/>\n<br/>\nDescriptive Statement: In the language arts literacy classroom,  <br/>\nstudents learn how to view in order<br/>\nto be able to respond thoughtfully and critically to the visual  <br/>\nmessages of both print and nonprint.<br/>\nEffective viewing is essential to comprehend and respond to personal  <br/>\ninteractions, live performances,<br/>\nvisual arts that involve oral and/or written language, and both print  <br/>\nmedia (graphs, charts, diagrams,<br/>\nillustrations, photographs, and graphic design in books, magazines,  <br/>\nand newspapers) and electronic<br/>\nmedia (television, computers, film). Students should recognize that  <br/>\nwhat they speak, hear, write, and<br/>\nread contributes to the content and quality of their viewing.<br/>\n<br/>\n=====================<br/>\n<br/>\nSo good.  All the TV watching and YouTube viewing and pop-up books and  <br/>\nsuch are justifiable now (for those of you who are gathering and  <br/>\nreporting for the state you&#39;re in, or something).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/education/frameworks/lal/chapt5v.pdf\">http://www.state.nj.us/education/frameworks/lal/chapt5v.pdf</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t read too many of those descriptions of |educational frameworks|  <br/>\nat once; it might make you woozy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46635,"nextTopicId":46652}}
