What I want to collect and share about it how learning can work, and that doesn’t have to do with laws.  My own volunteer time and energy (including keeping this group) isn’t about laws, but it about helping people who want to unschool and who CAN do it, to do it as well as they can.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd resources change, so a page I had many years ago that was useful and valuable isn’t so much anymore, as many discussions have gone to Facebook. <br/>\nMy old resource page:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/world\">http://sandradodd.com/world</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOh!
