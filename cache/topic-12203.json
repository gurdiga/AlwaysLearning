As Dylan would say, &quot;Holy Buckets!&quot;<br/>\nBut anyway...<br/>\nJanuary 30, 2003<br/>\nPhiladelphia Recruits and Trains Parents as Truant Officers<br/>\nBy THE ASSOCIATED PRESS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHILADELPHIA, Jan. 29 ï¿½ In an effort to corral thousands of <br/>\nclass-cutting<br/>\nstudents, the Philadelphia school district hired 250 truant officers <br/>\nlate<br/>\nlast year.<br/>\nAmong its hiring criteria for the job, one element loomed most <br/>\nimportant:<br/>\nthe district specifically recruited parents.<br/>\n&quot;Parents know the terrain, know the environment, understand the culture<br/>\nand may even know some of the individual parents and kids,&quot; said Paul<br/>\nVallas, chief executive of the 200,000-student school system.<br/>\nTruancy is a big concern in Philadelphia. On any given day, more than<br/>\n12,000 Philadelphia students, or 6.4 percent, are absent without an<br/>\nexcuse.<br/>\nThe problem worries school officials because truants are more likely to<br/>\nuse drugs, join gangs, commit crimes or drop out.<br/>\n&quot;Truancy is our first best flag that a kid will enter the juvenile<br/>\njustice system,&quot; said Ken Seeley, who is studying the effectiveness of<br/>\nseven truancy reduction programs for the Justice Department.<br/>\nMr. Vallas hired 600 parents for a similar program in Chicago, where he<br/>\nheaded the school system for six years. He said the program cut truancy<br/>\nto 3.9 percent from 5.7 percent.<br/>\nPhiladelphia contracted with 12 community and religious organizations <br/>\nto<br/>\nhire and train parent-truant officers. The training began last month; <br/>\nso<br/>\nfar, 166 parents have gone through the program and started visiting the<br/>\nhomes of truants. The officers are paid $9 an hour for at least 10 <br/>\nhours<br/>\na week.<br/>\n&quot;The primary role is to inform parents that their child has been <br/>\ntruant,<br/>\nthat resources are available, that we are ready to help,&quot; said Vern<br/>\nTrent, who heads the program.<br/>\nWhile it is too soon to tell whether the $1.2 million program is <br/>\nworking,<br/>\nthe officers had more than 1,600 contacts with parents through Dec. 31.<br/>\nSome parents are unaware that their children are cutting class. Others<br/>\ncannot afford clothes or bus tokens. Others are on drugs or alcohol.<br/>\nHastings Coach, who heads the parent-truant officer program for the<br/>\nWomen&#39;s Association for Women&#39;s Alternatives, a social services agency,<br/>\nsaid officers were told to be supportive and understanding, not<br/>\nthreatening.<br/>\n&quot;Any time you&#39;re in someone&#39;s home, you&#39;re a guest and you have to<br/>\nconduct yourself accordingly. You&#39;re not some authority with a stiff<br/>\nhand. You want to be invited back,&quot; Mr. Coach said.<br/>\nBut officers also explain that chronic absenteeism could land both<br/>\nstudents and their parents in the truancy court, with the possibility <br/>\nof<br/>\nfines, community service and even jail for the adults and transfer to <br/>\nan<br/>\nalternative school for the pupils.<br/>\nThat is smart, Mr. Seeley said, because any successful <br/>\ntruancy-reduction<br/>\nprogram needs to have both carrots and sticks. In Jacksonville, Fla., <br/>\none<br/>\nof the programs he is studying, more than 100 parents have been <br/>\narrested<br/>\nfor failing to send their children to school.<br/>\nJennifer Jones, 42, whose children are 6, 16 and 19, said <br/>\nPhiladelphia&#39;s<br/>\ntruancy program was a natural fit for her. Her house is a magnet for<br/>\nneighborhood children; she has been known to break up fistfights; even<br/>\nbefore she became a truant officer, she confronted truants and ordered<br/>\nthem to go back to school.<br/>\nAnd because her own children are sometimes less than enthusiastic about<br/>\nschool, she understands how some parents have trouble making sure <br/>\ntheirs<br/>\ngo to class.<br/>\n&quot;I think people feel more comfortable dealing with another parent,&quot; Ms.<br/>\nJones said. &quot;Parents know what kids are capable of, how their minds<br/>\nwork.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
