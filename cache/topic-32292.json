I meant it in it&#39;s more basic<br/>\nsense--a gathering of two or more people who by virtue<br/>\nof choice (or birth, or force, or what have you) live<br/>\ntogether in a family, town, country, world, etc. In<br/>\nsuch a situation there are principles which govern the<br/>\nbehavior of participants. Whether on chooses to live<br/>\nby those principles is, of course, up to the<br/>\nindividual. My point was that there are consequences<br/>\nto not doing so. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also can&#39;t help but notice your use of the word<br/>\n&#39;exposure&#39;, recalling that my use of the word and<br/>\nconcept was what sort of tripped this wire in the<br/>\nfirst place.
