We start this Saturday.  My son and daughter are in groups with<br/>\nkids of their own age.  They have been very supportive of us in our<br/>\nHomeschooling and pretty nice all the way around.  We are involved in 4H<br/>\ntoo.  Here there is a 4H all homeschool but of course they are all<br/>\nreligious but not exclusive.  We go and have become friends with a woman<br/>\nwho has adopted kids.  We were thinking of starting a homeschool Camp<br/>\nFire group and it would have been open to all ages because there are<br/>\njust a few homeschoolers but neither the other homeschooler or I could<br/>\ndo it.  To me it doesn&#39;t matter if a kid is homeschooled or not or even<br/>\nreligious, kids are kids.  Lisa<br/>\n <br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Nanci Kuykendall (Ingah) [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aisliin@...\">aisliin@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Monday, October 21, 2002 2:18 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Camp Fire USA<br/>\n <br/>\nI have heard both good and bad things about Camp Fire USA.  I decided <br/>\nto do a little first hand research of my own and find out what they <br/>\nwere all about.  So I have been in touch with the Executive Director <br/>\nof our local Council, to get more information. In the course of our <br/>\ncorrespondence, he sent me some pages from the Leader Guide.  Most of <br/>\nit looked pretty good, but I was given pause by certain parts of it.  <br/>\nI thought I would share about my concerns here and get some feedback <br/>\nfrom all of you, and also ask for experiences of those who have been <br/>\ninvolved with Camp Fire, before I discuss this with my Camp Fire <br/>\ncontact.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Section that gave me pause is titled: Camp Fire USA Builds <br/>\nDevelopmental Assets<br/>\n<br/>\nIt begins by talking about the results and findings of a study done <br/>\nby the Search Institute, in the 1990s, which identified asset <br/>\nbuilding as a focus for youth development instead of problem <br/>\nsolving.  OK, I can get with that, being as I see prevention as <br/>\nbetter than bandages in general.  They go on to say that they have <br/>\nidentified 14 assets in the Camp Fire program that they believe help <br/>\nyouth to develop.  OK, so they are earmarking positives in their <br/>\nprogram, that&#39;s ok.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the next part starts to get creepy, and reads like a recipe for <br/>\ncooking up wonderful adults, as though it&#39;s a fool proof plan.  Here <br/>\nare the 14 assets:<br/>\n<br/>\n-Young Person has empathy, sensitivity and friendship  <br/>\n-Young person has knowledge of and comfort with people of different <br/>\ncultural/racial/ethnic backgrounds<br/>\n(ok, so far so good)<br/>\n-Young person serves the community 1 or more hours per week<br/>\n(whoa, what does this mean?  What counts as community service?  Is <br/>\nthe age of the child considered?  I think community service is a <br/>\ngreat thing and I encourage it, but I don&#39;t like being involved in a <br/>\nprogram where my child is REQUIRED to do it to meet some objective <br/>\nset by the group.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Young person receives support from 3 or more non-parent adults<br/>\n(ok, that sounds good)<br/>\n-Young person spends 3 or more hours per week in lessons or practice <br/>\nin music, theater or other arts<br/>\n(whoa again, mandatory minimum time duration on arts?  What counts <br/>\naccording to them?  What if my child is not classically artistic, or <br/>\ngoes through a phase where they are not?)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Young person spends 3 or more hours per week in sports, clubs, and <br/>\norganizations at school or in the community<br/>\n(whoa again!  Mandatory involvement in hobbies and recreational <br/>\nsports?  If they said, young person is encouraged to do this or that, <br/>\nok.  If they said they feel it is important, ok.  But just saying <br/>\nthat they spend X amount of hours per week is so arbitrary and <br/>\ncontrolling to me.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Young person is out with friends with &quot;nothing special to do&quot; two or <br/>\nfewer nights per week.<br/>\n(What??  Does that mean they think all their time should be planned <br/>\nand scheduled, even for teenagers?  Does that mean we are not <br/>\nsupposed to trust our children&#39;s judgement in general about how they <br/>\nspend their time?)<br/>\n                                          <br/>\nThe rest sounds good<br/>\n-Young person can resist negative peer pressure and dangerous <br/>\nsituations<br/>\n-Young person seeks to resolve conflict nonviolently<br/>\n-Young person knows how to plan ahead and make choices<br/>\n-Young person feels that he or she &quot;has control over things that <br/>\nhappen to me.&quot;<br/>\n-Young person reports having high self esteem.<br/>\n-Young person reports that &quot;my life has a purpose.&quot;<br/>\n-Young person is optimistic about his or her personal future<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then this &quot;All of the Camp Fire USA&#39;s curricula are outcome <br/>\nbased.  Forty Camp Fire outcomes were identified to develop these <br/>\nassets.  These outcomes guide all projects, programs and <br/>\nrecognitions.  The outcomes are in the appendix and referenced <br/>\nthroughout the grade level program books.  This makes it easy to know <br/>\nif you are using the Camp Fire activities and projects as designed, <br/>\nthe children will be experiencing the outcomes that will make them <br/>\ncaring, confident youth and future leaders.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a passionate Unschooler/Natural Learner how many ways can I say <br/>\nick?  Curricula?  Grade levels?  Outcome based? Am I just looking at <br/>\nthis the wrong way or not understanding what they are trying to say?<br/>\n<br/>\nElsewhere in the pages I received, it says &quot;When children and youth <br/>\njoin Camp Fire, they start at the level appropriate to their grade.&quot;  <br/>\nIs this program totally geared toward the institutional schooling <br/>\nsystem, and would we be totally out of place?  I don&#39;t really want to <br/>\nseparate my children out into narrow band age groups.  I don&#39;t think <br/>\nit is socially good for them.  I am one of those who is of the <br/>\nopinion that institutional schooling is intrinsically bad for the <br/>\nhuman mind and spirit, and that the institutional educational model <br/>\ncan never be made healthy enough to be effective or positive.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter I read the pages to my husband, he said &quot;Well I have heard <br/>\nenough.  YUCK!&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have Unschooling friends with a teenager who refer to their <br/>\nexperiences with &quot;the Cult of Camp Fire&quot; with a shudder.  Perhaps <br/>\nthat was just their local group or council, or is that indicative of <br/>\nthe general atmosphere?<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

And, built into all the Camp Fire curricula is &quot;design your own&quot; <br/>\ntype stuff to earn emblems and beads.  As an unschooler, I use the <br/>\ninformation in the books as a guide.  I give emblems and beads freely, based <br/>\non what I know the kid has done and what we&#39;re doing together.  I adapt it <br/>\nand change to suit our needs.  Even the councils change requirements, etc., <br/>\nfor their own purposes.  As an example, according to the nationally published <br/>\nmaterials our club met the criteria to become a Blue Ribbon Club in our first <br/>\nyear.  That wasn&#39;t really our goal, it just happened.  At the last minute, <br/>\nour council changed the criteria to allow another club to be awarded the <br/>\nhonor, as well.  (Our council is in a starting-over mode right now.)  Now <br/>\nthere are two Blue Ribbon Clubs in the council.  That looks good to United <br/>\nWay, see?  We&#39;re meeting our standards.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t consider Camp Fire to be a top-down organization.  I find it to be <br/>\nvery kid-centered.  Perhaps that&#39;s my unschooling outlook.  In my dealings <br/>\nwith other Camp Fire adults, I find if I can bring them back to what&#39;s best <br/>\nfor the kid in any given conflict, then they can see it, too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEvery council and every area is different, though.  Councils have very wide <br/>\nlatitude in how the programs are administered.  We only have 7 clubs and one <br/>\ncouncil in our whole state.  Out west some cities have several councils.  And <br/>\nthey usually have typical mainstream ideas about what youth programs should <br/>\nlook like.  I find, however, that Camp Fire is the most flexible and <br/>\nadaptable and that&#39;s why I use it.  I&#39;m a leader because I want to make any <br/>\nscouting-type experience that he wants more unschooly for my son.  Obviously, <br/>\nI believe even the kids in my club who are in school are going to benefit <br/>\nfrom that atmosphere.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m finding myself to be really enthusiastic about Camp Fire--more than I <br/>\nthought I would be.  I think it&#39;s because we are re-building, and I&#39;m getting <br/>\nto design and create what the council looks like.  My husband is now on the <br/>\nboard and so we are becoming invested in it in a big way.  Truth is if you <br/>\ndon&#39;t have enthusiasm for what you do, no one else will want to participate.  <br/>\nI think Camp Fire is a good program, and there is room for all types of <br/>\npeople.  Like most things, it is what you make it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":113028911,"authorName":"Dnowens@aol.com","from":"Dnowens@...","profile":"hsmominoz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Camp Fire USA","postDate":"1035245227","msgId":9888,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY1LjIzZWQ4MzJmLjJhZTVmMGFiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":9883,"nextInTopic":9903,"prevInTime":9887,"nextInTime":9889,"topicId":9883,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/21/02 3:20:56 PM Central Daylight Time, ...

I am currently going through Boy Scout Leader training and it <br/>\nis all curriculum this and outcome that. Big on the morally straight and <br/>\nreligious stuff. I&#39;m not too big on that. In fact it makes me kinda nervous, <br/>\nand that is why I volunteered to be a leader. I wanted to be able to have <br/>\nsome control. One of the things said the other night in training really made <br/>\nme pause. One guy was saying that if they can get a boy into scouts and keep <br/>\nhim there for three years, then they could mold the child for life. I don&#39;t <br/>\nlike that at all, but Jack wants to be a scout right now. So I guess my <br/>\nfeelings are that if he wants to do this, then I am going to be there to see <br/>\nthat things don&#39;t get too military and religious. I would prefer that he not <br/>\nbe in it at all, but I recognize the need to be a part of a group at his age. <br/>\nIt is definitely a catch 22, kinda damned if you do, damned if you don&#39;t. The <br/>\nonly advice I can give is if your child really wants to be a scout (and there <br/>\nare lots of good things about it) then, be sure that you are a leader if you <br/>\ncan. <br/>\nNot really what you were looking for was it? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n~Nancy <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":67247159,"authorName":"Nanci Kuykendall (Ingah)","from":"&quot;Nanci Kuykendall (Ingah)&quot; &lt;aisliin@...&gt;","profile":"aisliin","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Camp Fire USA","postDate":"1035231488","msgId":9883,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFwMW5lMCs5bGJvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":9888,"prevInTime":9882,"nextInTime":9884,"topicId":9883,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have heard both good and bad things about Camp Fire USA.

So I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1176997338\">I have heard both good and bad things about Camp Fire USA.  I decided <br/>\nto do a little first hand research of my own and find out what they <br/>\nwere all about.  So I have been in touch with the Executive Director <br/>\nof our local Council, to get more information. In the course of our <br/>\ncorrespondence, he sent me some pages from the Leader Guide.  Most of <br/>\nit looked pretty good, but I was given pause by certain parts of it.  <br/>\nI thought I would share about my concerns here and get some feedback <br/>\nfrom all of you, and also ask for experiences of those who have been <br/>\ninvolved with Camp Fire, before I discuss this with my Camp Fire <br/>\ncontact.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Section that gave me pause is titled: Camp Fire USA Builds <br/>\nDevelopmental Assets<br/>\n<br/>\nIt begins by talking about the results and findings of a study done <br/>\nby the Search Institute, in the 1990s, which identified asset <br/>\nbuilding as a focus for youth development instead of problem <br/>\nsolving.  OK, I can get with that, being as I see prevention as <br/>\nbetter than bandages in general.  They go on to say that they have <br/>\nidentified 14 assets in the Camp Fire program that they believe help <br/>\nyouth to develop.  OK, so they are earmarking positives in their <br/>\nprogram, that&#39;s ok.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the next part starts to get creepy, and reads like a recipe for <br/>\ncooking up wonderful adults, as though it&#39;s a fool proof plan.  Here <br/>\nare the 14 assets:<br/>\n<br/>\n-Young Person has empathy, sensitivity and friendship  <br/>\n-Young person has knowledge of and comfort with people of different <br/>\ncultural/racial/ethnic backgrounds<br/>\n(ok, so far so good)<br/>\n-Young person serves the community 1 or more hours per week<br/>\n(whoa, what does this mean?  What counts as community service?  Is <br/>\nthe age of the child considered?  I think community service is a <br/>\ngreat thing and I encourage it, but I don&#39;t like being involved in a <br/>\nprogram where my child is REQUIRED to do it to meet some objective <br/>\nset by the group.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Young person receives support from 3 or more non-parent adults<br/>\n(ok, that sounds good)<br/>\n-Young person spends 3 or more hours per week in lessons or practice <br/>\nin music, theater or other arts<br/>\n(whoa again, mandatory minimum time duration on arts?  What counts <br/>\naccording to them?  What if my child is not classically artistic, or <br/>\ngoes through a phase where they are not?)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Young person spends 3 or more hours per week in sports, clubs, and <br/>\norganizations at school or in the community<br/>\n(whoa again!  Mandatory involvement in hobbies and recreational <br/>\nsports?  If they said, young person is encouraged to do this or that, <br/>\nok.  If they said they feel it is important, ok.  But just saying <br/>\nthat they spend X amount of hours per week is so arbitrary and <br/>\ncontrolling to me.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Young person is out with friends with &quot;nothing special to do&quot; two or <br/>\nfewer nights per week.<br/>\n(What??  Does that mean they think all their time should be planned <br/>\nand scheduled, even for teenagers?  Does that mean we are not <br/>\nsupposed to trust our children&#39;s judgement in general about how they <br/>\nspend their time?)<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br/>\nThe rest sounds good<br/>\n-Young person can resist negative peer pressure and dangerous <br/>\nsituations<br/>\n-Young person seeks to resolve conflict nonviolently<br/>\n-Young person knows how to plan ahead and make choices<br/>\n-Young person feels that he or she &quot;has control over things that <br/>\nhappen to me.&quot;<br/>\n-Young person reports having high self esteem.<br/>\n-Young person reports that &quot;my life has a purpose.&quot;<br/>\n-Young person is optimistic about his or her personal future<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then this &quot;All of the Camp Fire USA&#39;s curricula are outcome <br/>\nbased.  Forty Camp Fire outcomes were identified to develop these <br/>\nassets.  These outcomes guide all projects, programs and <br/>\nrecognitions.  The outcomes are in the appendix and referenced <br/>\nthroughout the grade level program books.  This makes it easy to know <br/>\nif you are using the Camp Fire activities and projects as designed, <br/>\nthe children will be experiencing the outcomes that will make them <br/>\ncaring, confident youth and future leaders.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a passionate Unschooler/Natural Learner how many ways can I say <br/>\nick?  Curricula?  Grade levels?  Outcome based? Am I just looking at <br/>\nthis the wrong way or not understanding what they are trying to say?<br/>\n<br/>\nElsewhere in the pages I received, it says &quot;When children and youth <br/>\njoin Camp Fire, they start at the level appropriate to their grade.&quot;  <br/>\nIs this program totally geared toward the institutional schooling <br/>\nsystem, and would we be totally out of place?  I don&#39;t really want to <br/>\nseparate my children out into narrow band age groups.  I don&#39;t think <br/>\nit is socially good for them.  I am one of those who is of the <br/>\nopinion that institutional schooling is intrinsically bad for the <br/>\nhuman mind and spirit, and that the institutional educational model <br/>\ncan never be made healthy enough to be effective or positive.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter I read the pages to my husband, he said &quot;Well I have heard <br/>\nenough.  YUCK!&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have Unschooling friends with a teenager who refer to their <br/>\nexperiences with &quot;the Cult of Camp Fire&quot; with a shudder.
