Trashman <br/>\ncomes; mail comes.  That&#39;s Monday.   Kids didn&#39;t go to school?  NOT A CLUE.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh hey!  Today, though, Kirby and  Marty socialized with high school kids!<br/>\n<br/>\nA high school kid works where Kirby works.  As there was no school today, <br/>\nguys from his school had planned a big Halo extravaganza with four tvs and four <br/>\ngame systems (X-Box).  Sixteen players at once.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo because they weren&#39;t going to school today, they decided to spend the <br/>\nschool hours playing Halo.   No problem for them.  For Kirby and Marty!?  (And <br/>\nJoey and Jeremy, who spent the night so they&#39;d be here when it started...)   They <br/>\nwere to meet at the parking lot of the gaming store at 7:00 so Mike, the <br/>\nschool-guy, could lead them to his friend&#39;s house.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI was happily sleeping (actually having an elaborately stupid and frustrating <br/>\ndream, so it was fine) when the phone rang at 6:59.  Marty was on it, but I <br/>\ngot up and hiked to the front of the house to see whether Kirby had failed to <br/>\nwake up or something.  No, Kirby was out scraping frost off the windshield.  He <br/>\nhas never driven a car that early in the morning and didn&#39;t know much about <br/>\nfrost.  Seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo  the call was this:  Mike got there to meet Kirby, and the window was <br/>\nbroken on the store.  They&#39;d been broken into.  So he called Kirby to find out <br/>\nwhat to do.  They called their boss (who lives half an hour away instead of two <br/>\nminutes as we do) and waited for him to get there before going on to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was a lot of excitement for before 8:00 a.m.   And the game was tons of <br/>\nfun.  They came back all tumbling over each other to tell storie about how <br/>\ncool it was.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo on a day when school was out, my kids did a school-schedule day. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18085,"nextTopicId":18134}}
