I am currently researching unschooling. We have been<br/>\nhomeschooling for just over 2 years now, and are getting steadily more<br/>\n&#39;relaxed&#39;. I homeschool 2 children aged 16 and 11. I also have an 18<br/>\nyear old. As yet we are not unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am trying to discern what people actually mean by unschooling and so<br/>\nhave found your recent discussions interesting. It seems to me there<br/>\nare two major differences between a type of &#39;benign neglect&#39; and<br/>\nunschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe first seems to be  a steady diet of interests and resources fed to<br/>\nyour child with a lack of attachment to these resources in yourself.<br/>\nFor example you may leave a number of informative magazines (or other<br/>\nitems)around, but you do not mind if your child chooses to ignore<br/>\nthem. (ditto for trips etc. You go to the zoo, but you do not require<br/>\nyour child to &#39;do&#39; or &#39;see&#39; anything in particular whilst there)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second seems to be &#39;availability&#39;. For example if your child wants<br/>\nto know how the lawnmower works, you are immediately available to help<br/>\nher wrestle with the sticky garage door, provide screwdrivers for<br/>\nremoval of covers etc to see inside said lawnmower. (One may even get<br/>\nthe lawn cut, but maybe that&#39;s getting &#39;attached&#39; again!)Or available<br/>\nto drive to the library, or the beach or wherever. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can see at once in families there must be some give and take and<br/>\nsomeone needs to make sure there is some balance here, as bullying<br/>\nbetween family members is all too common. It should not always be the<br/>\nsame person who gives up their visit to the park in order to allow<br/>\nanother family member to visit the library. Ditto with financial<br/>\nresources, computer time, parental availability etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow do you experienced unschoolers feel I am on the right track here?<br/>\nIt is very hard to understand unschooling, particularly if you have no<br/>\n practical examples around you to observe.
