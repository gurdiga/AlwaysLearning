My son Harry, age<br/>\n5 goes through this often.  I&#39;m finding it hard to &quot;stay ahead&quot; of him with<br/>\nregard to food.  He eats lots of chocolate and tiny amounts of everything<br/>\nelse.  I do my very best to shield him from the negative comments from the<br/>\nadults we see regularly in our lives.  Even some of the kids we play with<br/>\nhave commented on the amount of candy we keep in the house.  The prevailing<br/>\ntheme seems to be that if we didn&#39;t keep the candy in our house he would<br/>\nmagically begin to eat a different diet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am reminded of the La Leche League advice about watching your baby for<br/>\nearly hunger cues and that crying was actually a very late hunger cue and<br/>\ncould sometimes (ironically) make the feeding go poorly.  The same is true<br/>\nfor Harry - I need to be mindful and try to catch those early hunger cues<br/>\nand get something to him BEFORE he is screaming, uncomfortable, and<br/>\ngenerally freaking out. At that point he won&#39;t eat anything.  And while I<br/>\n*know* this I still need be be reminded periodically he takes food in<br/>\nreally TINY amounts.  1/3 of a string cheese.  3 TLC crackers.  1/2 of a<br/>\nsandwich.  6 cashew nuts. 2 chicken nuggets. One slice of salami. 1/4 apple<br/>\n(sliced very thin)  1/2 a pancake.

Since then, we&#39;ve worked really hard on not limiting<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; foods she&#39;s eating, buying enough of her favourite foods so that she<br/>\n&gt; never<br/>\n&gt; &gt; runs out (within budget, but we do pretty well), and though my husband<br/>\n&gt; and I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stress from time to time, I think she&#39;s pretty aware that we don&#39;t mind<br/>\n&gt; what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; she eats, and she can request something and we&#39;ll do our best to get it<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; her. She also eats a children&#39;s multivitamin (in gummi bear form, what a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; great idea), which helps us be a bit calmer about it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; However, after 18 months of this, her diet is still very limited. She<br/>\n&gt; eats<br/>\n&gt; &gt; chicken nuggets (cooked in the oven at home) for breakfast and dinner<br/>\n&gt; most<br/>\n&gt; &gt; days. In between she&#39;ll eat a variety of fruit (about 3 or 4 different<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kinds, no where near the variety she used to eat), a lot of rice<br/>\n&gt; &gt; crackers/flavoured rice cakes, and a few pieces of bread (usually<br/>\n&gt; without<br/>\n&gt; &gt; toppings of any kind). Sometimes she&#39;ll have something different, like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; potato chips/fries, fish fingers, hash browns instead of the nuggets.<br/>\n&gt; She<br/>\n&gt; &gt; almost never eats what we are having, even the meals that she used to<br/>\n&gt; eat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with us. There are one or two meals she still will eat (baked potato,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pizza, though she only has bacon and pineapple on a pizza base without<br/>\n&gt; any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other toppings), and we try to have these frequently. She eats a fair<br/>\n&gt; bit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of chocolate and other lollies.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not so much worried about what she&#39;s eating, as the fact that she<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t seem happy about it. She isn&#39;t looking forward to dinner, or any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kind of food really (other than chocolate). When we ask what she wants<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dinner, she doesn&#39;t know, and often gets quite upset. If we just served<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; food we think she would like, or offered a selection on a platter, she<br/>\n&gt; will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; scream, and has on one or two occasions thrown the food across the room.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; She really wants everyone to eat the same thing, but wants us to eat<br/>\n&gt; what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; she&#39;s eating, not the other way around. We try to do this where<br/>\n&gt; possible,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; by having a couple of nuggest with whatever we&#39;re having, which she<br/>\n&gt; seems<br/>\n&gt; &gt; satisfied with for now.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; She also often doesn&#39;t seem to eat enough during the day. She will get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; quite grumpy and upset more than normal if she hasn&#39;t eaten, and won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; request food if she&#39;s hungry. I&#39;m not sure that she does actually feel<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &#39;hunger&#39;, or perhaps she doesn&#39;t recognise it? I admit to being a little<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like this myself. I make a point of eating something for dinner and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; breakfast, but often forget to eat for a lot of the rest of the day, so<br/>\n&gt; I do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; understand why she does it, but I don&#39;t yell at everyone when I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; hungry.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s even worse if we are visiting friends/playing at the park with<br/>\n&gt; friends,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as she&#39;s so busy playing that she pretty much doesn&#39;t eat at all, and<br/>\n&gt; gets<br/>\n&gt; &gt; very frustrated when her friends stop playing to eat.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; She has just gotten to the point where she will request a new food to<br/>\n&gt; try,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and we make sure we get these whenever she asks. Usually, she&#39;ll try<br/>\n&gt; them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; once, and either decide she doesn&#39;t like them (not a problem), or try<br/>\n&gt; them,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; say they&#39;re nice, but not eat more than one mouthful.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Have we not being doing it for long enough for her to feel good about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; eating?

I had a childhood friend who went to the same Korean church as me whose parents forced her to practice piano 2-3 hours everyday.  She started piano lessons at age 3.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents did not force any lessons -- they were very laissez faire, about their parenting in general.  I often felt they provided shelter, food and money for lessons and not much else.<br/>\n<br/>\nI took one year of piano lessons (age 8), 3 years of violin (age 9-11) 1 electric guitar lesson (age 14).  I initiated and quit each on my own.  I started to play piano again passionately around age 12 when I discovered musicals via Les Miserables and Andrew Lloyd Webber.  I wanted to practice singing songs from the musicals, so I played my own accompaniment.  I started performing professionally as an actress in the children&#39;s theater at the John F. Kennedy center in Washington DC.  I don&#39;t know if I practiced piano everyday back then, but I really enjoyed learning to become proficient on my own.  I branched out to playing U2 and 10,000 Maniacs songs by ear, singing simultaneously.  I wrote songs and at 15, my English teacher had me videotaped playing guitar and singing my song about Catcher in the Rye as an example for future English classes.  I work in film editing where music editing is essential to the process and I am highly skilled at selecting and incorporating music (though there is a specific position who does this).  On my own time, I improvise on my electric piano and play guitar and sing with my girls.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember feeling sorry for my childhood friend who was forced to play piano.  She was never allowed to spend the night or come to parties where boys were invited.  She won competition after competition playing piano, and had perfect pitch.  I thought the perfect pitch was cool -- we used to test her at church and I remember being blown away by her explaining that different tape cassette players played at different speeds, so there was no absolute pitch on cassettes.  She knew this because of her perfect pitch.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend went to Juilliard for piano.  When she graduated, she decided that she did not want to play piano anymore.  She then went to a prestigious Ivy league law school.  She passed the bar but did not want to practice law.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently saw her and was intrigued about her life&#39;s journey as she is now a professional poker dealer.

Since then, we&#39;ve worked really hard on not limiting the <br/>\n&gt; foods she&#39;s eating, buying enough of her favourite foods so that she never <br/>\n&gt; runs out (within budget, but we do pretty well), and though my husband and I <br/>\n&gt; stress from time to time, I think she&#39;s pretty aware that we don&#39;t mind what <br/>\n&gt; she eats, and she can request something and we&#39;ll do our best to get it for <br/>\n&gt; her.  She also eats a children&#39;s multivitamin (in gummi bear form, what a <br/>\n&gt; great idea), which helps us be a bit calmer about it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; However, after 18 months of this, her diet is still very limited.  She eats <br/>\n&gt; chicken nuggets (cooked in the oven at home) for breakfast and dinner most <br/>\n&gt; days.  In between she&#39;ll eat a variety of fruit (about 3 or 4 different <br/>\n&gt; kinds, no where near the variety she used to eat), a lot of rice <br/>\n&gt; crackers/flavoured rice cakes, and a few pieces of bread (usually without <br/>\n&gt; toppings of any kind).  Sometimes she&#39;ll have something different, like <br/>\n&gt; potato chips/fries, fish fingers, hash browns instead of the nuggets. She <br/>\n&gt; almost never eats what we are having, even the meals that she used to eat <br/>\n&gt; with us.  There are one or two meals she still will eat (baked potato, <br/>\n&gt; pizza, though she only has bacon and pineapple on a pizza base without any <br/>\n&gt; other toppings), and we try to have these frequently.  She eats a fair bit <br/>\n&gt; of chocolate and other lollies.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not so much worried about what she&#39;s eating, as the fact that she <br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t seem happy about it.  She isn&#39;t looking forward to dinner, or any <br/>\n&gt; kind of food really (other than chocolate).  When we ask what she wants for <br/>\n&gt; dinner, she doesn&#39;t know, and often gets quite upset.  If we just served the <br/>\n&gt; food we think she would like, or offered a selection on a platter, she will <br/>\n&gt; scream, and has on one or two occasions thrown the food across the room. <br/>\n&gt; She really wants everyone to eat the same thing, but wants us to eat what <br/>\n&gt; she&#39;s eating, not the other way around.  We try to do this where possible, <br/>\n&gt; by having a couple of nuggest with whatever we&#39;re having, which she seems <br/>\n&gt; satisfied with for now.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She also often doesn&#39;t seem to eat enough during the day.  She will get <br/>\n&gt; quite grumpy and upset more than normal if she hasn&#39;t eaten, and won&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; request food if she&#39;s hungry.  I&#39;m not sure that she does actually feel <br/>\n&gt; &#39;hunger&#39;, or perhaps she doesn&#39;t recognise it?  I admit to being a little <br/>\n&gt; like this myself.  I make a point of eating something for dinner and <br/>\n&gt; breakfast, but often forget to eat for a lot of the rest of the day, so I do <br/>\n&gt; understand why she does it, but I don&#39;t yell at everyone when I&#39;m hungry. <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s even worse if we are visiting friends/playing at the park with friends, <br/>\n&gt; as she&#39;s so busy playing that she pretty much doesn&#39;t eat at all, and gets <br/>\n&gt; very frustrated when her friends stop playing to eat.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She has just gotten to the point where she will request a new food to try, <br/>\n&gt; and we make sure we get these whenever she asks.  Usually, she&#39;ll try them <br/>\n&gt; once, and either decide she doesn&#39;t like them (not a problem), or try them, <br/>\n&gt; say they&#39;re nice, but not eat more than one mouthful.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Have we not being doing it for long enough for her to feel good about <br/>\n&gt; eating?  Can I expect she might increase her food options in the future? <br/>\n&gt; Should I be worried at how little she&#39;s eating?  I honestly have gotten to <br/>\n&gt; the point where I don&#39;t mind what she eats, I just want her to be able to <br/>\n&gt; find food she enjoys, and eat enough to keep her mood a little bit stable.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tamara<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185586397,"authorName":"Lyla Wolfenstein","from":"Lyla Wolfenstein &lt;lylaw@...&gt;","profile":"lylawolf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Tiger mothers raise their heads again ;-)","postDate":"1321258279","msgId":63770,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBREZVMFNDdGExaFY5K2s5SitVTFdpSFhtaUV0dlhyRXJHcXF6YVJlVmhOU2l0dmVXd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDc4MjdBRUE4LTJCN0EtNEY4NC1COTY0LTg5QTBDMTU3M0MzNUBiaWdwb25kLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEM5ODA5QjI3LTFBQ0EtNDJBQy1BRjg0LUFGQUYxQTQ0MTk2Q0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4JPDc4MjdBRUE4LTJCN0EtNEY4NC1COTY0LTg5QTBDMTU3M0MzNUBiaWdwb25kLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":63769,"nextInTopic":63772,"prevInTime":63769,"nextInTime":63771,"topicId":63742,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"joyce, if you are so moved, feel free to give this person a link to my article that was printed in life learning magazine on this topic. it s on my blog now: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1065822310\">joyce, if you are so moved, feel free to give this person a link to my<br/>\narticle that was printed in life learning magazine on this topic. it&#39;s on<br/>\nmy blog now:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lylawolf.blogspot.com/2011/03/real-costs-of-parental-pressure.html?spref=tw\">http://lylawolf.blogspot.com/2011/03/real-costs-of-parental-pressure.html?spref=tw</a><br/>\n<br/>\nlyla<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":170380942,"authorName":"Lisa","from":"&quot;Lisa&quot; &lt;lisa@...&gt;","profile":"cslisacs","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Need some advice about food again.","postDate":"1321253665","msgId":63769,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGo5cWR2MStqMWt0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PERGNkExMURDLUYyNTMtNERFOS1BRTE0LTIyRjlGMEZGMkE3RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":63768,"nextInTopic":63770,"prevInTime":63768,"nextInTime":63770,"topicId":63742,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

A lot of it is probably genetics - my son also has a major sweet tooth - but if I were to guess why I am sometimes unable or unwilling to turn down sweets I would attach it to the fact that I never was allowed them.

Perhaps you have not seen this very much because a lot of people are forced to do things by parents, school etc.  But without that forcing, people&#39;s skill levels can grow really beautifully, with no shadows brought into it by having been forced to do things that they did not want to do.  They find their own understandings which are deeply meaningful to them and will stay with them.  Their understandings are able to grow unhindered by the weighty baggage that years of forcing bring.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience, it is the people who haven&#39;t been forced, whose skills are deepest, strongest; whose understandings are the greatest, and whose joy in what they do is fully intact.  They seem to be able to take things further because their passions and drive have not withered under the forcing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn analogy:  I like eating, but only when I&#39;m hungry.  If I was repeatedly forced to eat when I wasn&#39;t hungry, eating would lose some of its joy and pleasure, even when I was hungry.  The pleasure in eating when hungry would get all muddied from my having been forced to eat when I didn&#39;t want to.  The more I was forced, the more of a mess I would be with food, the less joy I would find in eating.  And joy is important!<br/>\n<br/>\nI see the same type of thing happen with music.  I see a great many musicians who can play the notes, but who drag ensembles down with their negativity, clock-watching and unresponsive, lifeless playing.  Lots of the professional orchestras where I live, are known for not being happy workplaces.  It appears to me that a lot of this comes from many/most of the players having been forced to do practice etc (usually repeatedly) and now not knowing how to enjoy what they do and/or to do what they enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhereas the people who run with music of their own accord, are usually really fabulous players who find joy all over the place, are adaptable, creative, responsive etc.  From what I&#39;ve seen they are the ones who will make the music come to life.  Their spirit of adventure, of fun, of depth etc is intact.  They have not been damaged by being forced to do what they didn&#39;t want to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  I&#39;m still convinced that some things  <br/>\n&gt; are there that we all have to do as a child that help us later on.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Perhaps you could spend some time thinking deeply about that conviction - try to be open-minded about the answers to &#39;why&#39; and &#39;why not&#39;.  Sometimes there is a conditioned response along the lines of &quot;because you have to&quot;, &quot;everyone does&quot;, because the predominance of schoolish ways, can block out the view of other ways, which do nonetheless exist, even though you may never have seen them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ... But the  <br/>\n&gt; musicianship of an orchestra can only increase when the people who  <br/>\n&gt; play in it start to practice routinely, and work hard, even when they  <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t want to, at getting better, because they have that common goal  <br/>\n&gt; in mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Orchestras work best when everyone who&#39;s there wants to be there and can play well enough to be able to have fun with what they&#39;re playing.  It&#39;s best to leave &quot;work hard, even when they don&#39;t want to&quot; out of it altogether.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hell, getting better at an instrument, period, requires daily  <br/>\n&gt; practice and nothing less.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Er, no.  That&#39;s a pretty narrow-minded approach and it doesn&#39;t accord with reality.  People learn naturally in their own ways.  It&#39;s quite interesting how different people reach skilled levels at anything, and your statement above is not accurate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m a pretty lazy practicer, and I&#39;m not so  <br/>\n&gt; great at the viola either :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The concept of a &quot;lazy&quot; practiser is laden with judgement as to what is good practising and what isn&#39;t.  If joy is leading the way, life is happy and learning will happen.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ... But is the experience of something where  <br/>\n&gt; there&#39;s a requirement of skill level, achieved by practice and  <br/>\n&gt; dedication, worth pushing one&#39;s kid for? A child may not have the  <br/>\n&gt; foresight to realize that in five or six years they might be missing  <br/>\n&gt; out on something truly spectacular if they don&#39;t put the effort in  <br/>\n&gt; now.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They will be &quot;missing out on something truly spectacular&quot; if they are forced repeatedly to practise now.  They&#39;ll be missing out on happiness now, emotional wellbeing in the future and the chance to have become skilled in ways that work best for them.  Doing what we love to do, is important throughout life, and if this is not tampered with, it will continue to guide us happily through life.  If playing music with people is a part of that, then help it to happen.  Don&#39;t force it because of some idea that it&#39;s good for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is it the obligation of the parents to push a kid when he/she is  <br/>\n&gt; little so that they can enjoy later?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No.  Little kids are people now, too, and they will enjoy more later if they are allowed to enjoy now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ...my parents put me in an extracurricular math program that  <br/>\n&gt; was just rote practice every single day with instruction once a week.  <br/>\n&gt; I did that for 10 years and the number of tantrums I threw probably  <br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t be counted on the fingers of every person in New York City :)  <br/>\n&gt; But after thousands of pages of math, I can honestly say that  <br/>\n&gt; mathematics piques my interest to no end. It&#39;s beautiful, interesting,  <br/>\n&gt; and that ability to do problems and calculations really quickly in my  <br/>\n&gt; head helps in all facets of life.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No-one knows how you would feel about mathematical concepts now, if you had not done the math program.  You would probably be struggling less with these ideas about forcing being essential to skill development/future happiness, if you had not be forced to do the program.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do parents, once again, have the  <br/>\n&gt; obligation to set structure for a kid so that he/she can enjoy later?  <br/>\n&gt; This might be considered the basis behind getting a kid into college  <br/>\n&gt; and what not.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I suppose a counterargument might be... hmm, well you could say that  <br/>\n&gt; this method is not necessary, that a kid may explore passions or  <br/>\n&gt; interests in other fields. But doesn&#39;t it help to just give kids these  <br/>\n&gt; options?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sure, open as many doors as look interesting to kids, but don&#39;t force them to stay in rooms they don&#39;t enjoy, in the hope that this will lead to more happiness later on.  They will miss out on so much happiness now and as with the eating analogy above, it&#39;s hard to continue to find true joy in something when forcing&#39;s been a part of it, unless those wounds are healed. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ... So would you say  <br/>\n&gt; that setting kids up with some interesting literature, history, etc.  <br/>\n&gt; that they&#39;re interested in reading is good for them and setting them  <br/>\n&gt; up to be open to anything in the future? Basically what I&#39;m getting at  <br/>\n&gt; is is there a certain set of information that children should have,  <br/>\n&gt; that they deserve to have so that they can pursue whatever they want  <br/>\n&gt; later?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Support them in pursuing whatever interests/excites them in their childhoods and they will happily continue to pursue what they love later on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If their interest wavers, is it important to keep a kid focused  <br/>\n&gt; on something so that they can see the value of finishing something  <br/>\n&gt; completely?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see much value in &quot;finishing something completely&quot;, especially when I compare it to being able to grow with love and support, developing one&#39;s own unique passions.  If people were &#39;keeping me focused on something&#39;, I think it would build resentment more than I would come to see the value of finishing something.  Sometimes what happens is that people can take on the worldview of people who exercise control over them, and see themselves as flawed unless they... finish something compeletely, do that day&#39;s practice etc etc.  That leads to unhappy lives and/or lots of healing needed, because it&#39;s not true.<br/>\n<br/>\nDebbie.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":284087656,"authorName":"Karen","from":"&quot;Karen&quot; &lt;semajrak@...&gt;","profile":"semajrak","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Need some advice about food again.","postDate":"1321223805","msgId":63767,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGo5cGdwdCs2bXI5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDM4NEFDNDdGRkEzQjQ4M0U5QkNCMEY1ODE4QUNGOUU0QFRhbWFyYT4="},"prevInTopic":63764,"nextInTopic":63768,"prevInTime":63765,"nextInTime":63768,"topicId":63742,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We made some snack bowls together out of clay.  He loves eating from them.  When our friends come over, the kids request their favourites too.  Whenever we are at the thrift shop, Ethan usually picks out some kind of bowl or plate he thinks is special.  Perhaps your daughter would enjoy some dishes of her very own?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing we did was introduce games while we all shared some food together - easy games like dice games, or charades, or pictionary, or dinner games...games that would make us laugh, and have some fun while we ate.

The other day, we brought home celleric (sp?).  Ethan thought it looked so creepy.  He spent about 20 minutes cutting off the outer layer to make it look better.

Sometimes kids don&#39;t like to eat because of sinus or related issues (ear or throat) or just a weak sense of smell. The folks in my extended family who have conservative tastes, including Mo, all have a very weak sense of smell or allergies. That&#39;s something to think about if the smell of food doesn&#39;t seem interesting to your child and/or if she seems very focused on things like texture - without smell, looks and texture are much, much more important. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Need some advice about food again.","postDate":"1321215430","msgId":63763,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGo5cDhrNitqcnMwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDM4NEFDNDdGRkEzQjQ4M0U5QkNCMEY1ODE4QUNGOUU0QFRhbWFyYT4="},"prevInTopic":63762,"nextInTopic":63764,"prevInTime":63762,"nextInTime":63764,"topicId":63742,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

There&#39;s starch, protein and fruits, plus the multi-vitamin. If you don&#39;t know other kids who have conservatives tastes, it probably doesn&#39;t seem like much, but conservatives tastes run in my family - your kid eats ten different foods? Not counting varieties? Score. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;She isn&#39;t looking forward to dinner, or any <br/>\n&gt; kind of food really (other than chocolate).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>She may be really busy with other things. My kids don&#39;t really &quot;look forward to&quot; meals, they get hungry and eat things. Food is more often fuel than anything else. I forget how old your daughter is. When Mo was little, I would &quot;dress up&quot; food to get her attention while she was playing - wrap things up like little presents, or serve food using toys as cups and plates. It was a way to make food interesting enough to get her to notice it - otherwise she&#39;d forget to eat and end up nauseated and unAble to eat. Actually, that&#39;s not true (its been a few years!) she could eat candy when she was that hungry sick and usually after a few pieces of candy she could drink milk, so that was our emergency fallback plan for days when food wasn&#39;t anywhere on her radar. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Should I be worried at how little she&#39;s eating? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Mo eats such minuscule amounts that a handful of m&ms and a large glass of milk was easily a whole meal when she was younger. Now - at 10 - she still has a very dainty appetite. She&#39;s very robust, though, so it&#39;s hard to actually worry about her - it&#39;s kind of amazing to see how much she can do on practically no &quot;fuel&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s even worse if we are visiting friends/playing at the park with friends, <br/>\n&gt; as she&#39;s so busy playing that she pretty much doesn&#39;t eat at all, and gets <br/>\n&gt; very frustrated when her friends stop playing to eat.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Snacks in the car! That&#39;s my ongoing gameplan so that Mo will eat something either on the way to or from a playdate. That and stopping for ice-cream on the way home. Little things like popcorn or dry breakfast cereal are really handy for car snacks - especially cereal since you can get something colorful and attractive and sweet but also loaded up with vitamins.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing is lots of beverages - juice boxes and milk are ideal for car-snacks and make a great source of nutrition for a child who doesn&#39;t really care about eating. Mo will notice she&#39;s thirsty long before she&#39;s hungry. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Need some advice about food again.","postDate":"1321213791","msgId":63762,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwMkIxMEI5LUMwMkUtNDU0Ni1BNUFBLUUzNzhBNjg2ODZFMkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDE0MDk3RTZCNzAwRTQwODVCNUQxMjM5NDYxMTQzQkJDQEVkUEM+","referencesHeader":"PEM5ODA5QjI3LTFBQ0EtNDJBQy1BRjg0LUFGQUYxQTQ0MTk2Q0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4gPDM4NEFDNDdGRkEzQjQ4M0U5QkNCMEY1ODE4QUNGOUU0QFRhbWFyYT4gPDE0MDk3RTZCNzAwRTQwODVCNUQxMjM5NDYxMTQzQkJDQEVkUEM+"},"prevInTopic":63760,"nextInTopic":63763,"prevInTime":63761,"nextInTime":63763,"topicId":63742,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-He too will try something different every once in a while but either says he does not like it or says it isn t too bad but does not want more.-=- Holly will","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-626592895\">-=-He too will try something different every once in a while but either says he does not like it or says it isn&#39;t too bad but does not want more.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly will do that, and she&#39;s 20. :-)<br/>\nShe&#39;ll taste something, and say it&#39;s good, but not want a whole serving.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t worry.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":143043046,"authorName":"Ed Wendell","from":"&quot;Ed Wendell&quot; &lt;ewendell@...&gt;","profile":"zelco123","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Need some advice about food again.","postDate":"1321207516","msgId":63760,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0MDk3RTZCNzAwRTQwODVCNUQxMjM5NDYxMTQzQkJDQEVkUEM+","inReplyToHeader":"PDM4NEFDNDdGRkEzQjQ4M0U5QkNCMEY1ODE4QUNGOUU0QFRhbWFyYT4=","referencesHeader":"PEM5ODA5QjI3LTFBQ0EtNDJBQy1BRjg0LUFGQUYxQTQ0MTk2Q0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4gPDM4NEFDNDdGRkEzQjQ4M0U5QkNCMEY1ODE4QUNGOUU0QFRhbWFyYT4="},"prevInTopic":63759,"nextInTopic":63762,"prevInTime":63759,"nextInTime":63761,"topicId":63742,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Zachariah is 17 and eats very few foods.

He ate basically everything/anything up until the age of 5 and then started eliminating foods he once loved.   Although he never really liked fruits to begin with, now he never eats fruit.  The veggies he will eat now and then are french fries pretty much anywhere and salad at Olive garden (just the lettuce and crutons). All foods have to be a certain brand and fixed a certain way.  He will eat some foods at a particular restaurant but not at other restaurants nor at home, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he was younger he would stand in the kitchen and cry because he was hungry but reject everything I offered to fix him, saying &quot;I&#39;m starving but nothing sounds good.&quot;  If it was something he was used to eating he might say he was tired of that but nothing else sounds good.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe too will try something different every once in a while but either says he does not like it or says it isn&#39;t too bad but does not want more.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe goes through cycles of what he will eat.  For a couple of years it was almost exclusively tacos every meal - flour tortillas, 90% ground beef with Taco Bell seasoning, shredded iceberg lettuce - now he won&#39;t touch them.  Sometimes he cycles back to something - roast beef from the deli on sourdough bread is one he will eat for a couple of weeks and then not for a year and then back to it.  The other day the deli gave us a different brand of roast beef and he could not eat it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis biggest constant (for at home meals) for the past several years has been hamburgers: ground round & shredded cheddar cheese on a bun, along with tortilla chips & salsa.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe rarely gets sick - maybe a sniffle once a winter and that is it.  He is healthy and has grown very well.  He is 6&#39;4&quot; and a healthy weight.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a lot of people that eat very few foods - variety is not their thing - and they are healthy and happy.  If one thinks back into history most people did not eat a wide variety of foods.  Foods were regional and people ate the same foods over and over again.  I grew up on a farm and we pretty much ate the same basic meals over and over - we had roast with potatoes and carrots every Sunday after church.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Need some advice about food again.","postDate":"1321207161","msgId":63759,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMjEyMDcxNjEuMjExNzUuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTA0Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDc3NEQxQzE3LTRGMUQtNDBBRS04MkNDLUM3OUY4QUNEMTY2OEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PEM5ODA5QjI3LTFBQ0EtNDJBQy1BRjg0LUFGQUYxQTQ0MTk2Q0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4gPDM4NEFDNDdGRkEzQjQ4M0U5QkNCMEY1ODE4QUNGOUU0QFRhbWFyYT4gPEY5MTRBMzk1LUVDMTgtNDRGMy05ODA5LUI5QTYzM0EyNTIwQ0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDEzMjEyMDM5NTcuMjAxMDYuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTAyLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDEzMjEyMDQ1NDcuNDU1NzMuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTA3Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDc3NEQxQzE3LTRGMUQtNDBBRS04MkNDLUM3OUY4QUNEMTY2OEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":63758,"nextInTopic":63760,"prevInTime":63758,"nextInTime":63760,"topicId":63742,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"    ...

She will get <br/>\nquite grumpy and upset more than normal if she hasn&#39;t eaten, and won&#39;t <br/>\nrequest food if she&#39;s hungry.  I&#39;m not sure that she does actually feel <br/>\n&#39;hunger&#39;, or perhaps she doesn&#39;t recognise it?  I admit to being a little <br/>\nlike this myself.  I make a point of eating something for dinner and <br/>\nbreakfast, but often forget to eat for a lot of the rest of the day, so I do <br/>\nunderstand why she does it, &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf remembering to eat is a problem you need to be more proactive about feeding <br/>\nher. Take the time, every day, a couple of times a day, to put together a few <br/>\nthings that you know she likes on a plate and put it down near her. It is often <br/>\nhard, when you are focused on what is in front of you, to take time away from it <br/>\nto do something else. You state that it is a problem you&#39;ve overcome with <br/>\npersonal discipline. Rather than expecting that of your daughter, you need to <br/>\naccommodate her. For the peace of her relationships, for the peace of your <br/>\nlives, figuring out how to meet her needs is a very good thing to do. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou wrote that she&#39;s thrown food across the room a couple of times and screamed <br/>\nwhen things were offered. Are you waiting too long to offer? Is she already in a <br/>\nfoul mood when you are offering something to eat? Maybe don&#39;t give it to her <br/>\ndirectly. Maybe just put it down near to her. I can&#39;t imagine what would <br/>\nprecipitate such a huge response unless she feels so pressured about food. <br/>\nAlthough that may not be it at all. But that&#39;s a very negative response to a <br/>\ngenerous act. Even so, I would continue trying to get her food before she is <br/>\nclearly hungry. And I would continue to offer platters. But maybe work more for <br/>\nthem to be things you know she likes and less for them to be things you wish she <br/>\nwould eat. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot; but I don&#39;t yell at everyone when I&#39;m hungry. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI do. Well, I don&#39;t now, but I have done. It&#39;s one of the ways I can tell if <br/>\nI&#39;ve gone too long without dealing with my food needs. I start to get grumpy and <br/>\nsnappy. I am quick to see the relationship now, but it took the ideas of people <br/>\nhere to help me to really see that. It took noticing how happy and generous I <br/>\nwas most of the time to see when I was being smaller and mean and what factors <br/>\nplayed a role in that. It took a long time for me to see my reaction to things <br/>\nas a part of how well I was feeling. I wouldn&#39;t expect that kind of <br/>\nunderstanding to come easily to someone else. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of your post is about what she eats and what she doesn&#39;t eat. The lack of <br/>\nvariety. I spent much of my childhood refusing to eat food. I was spanked by the <br/>\nteacher and then by my parents for claiming that I was allergic to food when I <br/>\nwas 6 because I didn&#39;t want to eat what the cafeteria was offering and teachers <br/>\nwould monitor what we threw away. Having had a childhood where dinner was a time <br/>\nof trauma, where I might get stuck sitting at the table staring at food I didn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to eat rather than be allowed to go and do something, anything else (my mom <br/>\nsays it only happened once, but my memory is different), where I was often <br/>\naccused of saying I didn&#39;t like something when I couldn&#39;t possibly know because <br/>\nI&#39;d never tried it--what a weird statment that is, food smells, it has <br/>\nappearance, it has clear texture, you don&#39;t have to try it to have already <br/>\nsensed whether or not it would be an experience you wanted to know--I am now <br/>\ncalled a foodie. Not that I think that it is inevitable, that a childhood of not <br/>\nenjoying food will lead to an adult life of really enjoying food. I don&#39;t really <br/>\nenjoy most food. I struggle with lunch often because I don&#39;t want to just eat <br/>\nanything. My foodie-ness, my love of some food, has grown easily from my dislike <br/>\nof many foods. And my liking more food than I ever would have anticipated as I <br/>\nsat, sullenly, angrily, at the table looking at stuffed green peppers for hours <br/>\non end, wishing we had a dog, or that my napkin could hold more, has grown from <br/>\nmy enjoyment of some food. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGo with that. She likes chicken nuggets. I like chicken nuggets. I make chicken <br/>\nnuggets. I have deep fat fryer and I go and buy a chicken and I cut it up and I <br/>\nmarinate the chicken pieces in yoghurt for however long it was from when I <br/>\nremembered to do the first bit to when I need to get dinner ready, and then I <br/>\ndip them in flour, and then egg, and then bread crumbs that are a product of the <br/>\nsourdough bread I make not all getting eaten. I also do pork chops that way and <br/>\nthen David makes a Japanese curry sauce from a packet and rice and we have curry <br/>\nrisu. Or shrimp or sweet potato or carrots or green beans or mushrooms or <br/>\nwhatever else. Or onion rings. But I do those differently, those are just cut up <br/>\nand put in water and then dipped in flour and fried. But, my lands, are they <br/>\never tasty. Oh, I think I must be hungry. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChocolate is fabulous. Chocolate fondue is so good. Cut up lots of yummy fruit <br/>\nand melt up some chocolate and butter and set it all out for a dipping <br/>\ngloriousness. Totally messy, and fabulous. Or chocolate cake. One of my <br/>\nfavourites is a Pioneer Woman cake <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2007/06/the_best_chocol/.\">http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2007/06/the_best_chocol/.</a> It isn&#39;t quite <br/>\ncake, it&#39;s almost a fudge cake.

They are so wonderfully moreish. You <br/>\nand she could make lollies and chocolate treats and see what would be good. You <br/>\ncould make gummi bears. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you look at what you&#39;ve listed: potatoes, fruit, rice, bread, chicken, <br/>\npizza, chocolate, it&#39;s a pretty fair range of things. And it&#39;s a range of things <br/>\nthat may, over time, allow for greater exploration. But she&#39;s 7, right? My guess <br/>\nis that she won&#39;t be keen to expand her choices yet. And she may still feel very <br/>\nmuch pressed to be a better eater than she already is. As I said, my mother&#39;s <br/>\nmemories of my sitting at the table are different to mine. My image of myself as <br/>\npicky, fussy eater made me loathe to go new places or to eat at other people&#39;s <br/>\nhomes.

Kids with  <br/>\nlimited palates are world wide.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m not so much worried about what she&#39;s eating, as the fact that she<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t seem happy about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Have done monkey platters to present her with a wide variety of foods?<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/monkeyplatters/\">http://sandradodd.com/monkeyplatters/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe purpose, though, shouldn&#39;t be to broaden her palate. The purpose  <br/>\nis to provide choice. And for a child with a limited palate, it can  <br/>\nalso provide choices of things she hasn&#39;t had before or recently.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was very frustrating for Kathryn for special meals like a picnic  <br/>\nwhere she wanted special foods rather than what her body had limited  <br/>\nher to :-/<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  When we ask what she wants for<br/>\n&gt; dinner, she doesn&#39;t know, and often gets quite upset.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Imagine how frustrating it must be to be in a world full of food but  <br/>\nmost of it tastes yucky! She undoubtedly doesn&#39;t know. She just wants  <br/>\nfood that doesn&#39;t make her gag.<br/>\n<br/>\nSympathy. (Not for throwing the food!) Understanding. You can provide  <br/>\nlots of different foods, but you can&#39;t change her body chemistry.  <br/>\nMaybe think of it as a broken leg. (Though broken may not be the best  <br/>\nidea to relate it to.) A broken leg is frustrating and uncomfortable.  <br/>\nYou can&#39;t make that part go away.

It&#39;s also compounded by not wanting to  <br/>\ninterrupt something interesting for something uninteresting. (Which is  <br/>\nnot limited to just kids.

Classical, scales etc. I hour practice a day, 2 hours a day in my final 2 years. When I refused, my hands were held over the keys till I played. I had to take yearly exams that I got top marks in, and perform in competitions. I won them. The last note I played on the piano was the last note of my highschool exam 22 years ago.  I hate the sound of piano now. I hate the memories of having no choice.

Since then, we&#39;ve worked really hard on not limiting the <br/>\nfoods she&#39;s eating, buying enough of her favourite foods so that she never <br/>\nruns out (within budget, but we do pretty well), and though my husband and I <br/>\nstress from time to time, I think she&#39;s pretty aware that we don&#39;t mind what <br/>\nshe eats, and she can request something and we&#39;ll do our best to get it for <br/>\nher.  She also eats a children&#39;s multivitamin (in gummi bear form, what a <br/>\ngreat idea), which helps us be a bit calmer about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, after 18 months of this, her diet is still very limited.  She eats <br/>\nchicken nuggets (cooked in the oven at home) for breakfast and dinner most <br/>\ndays.  In between she&#39;ll eat a variety of fruit (about 3 or 4 different <br/>\nkinds, no where near the variety she used to eat), a lot of rice <br/>\ncrackers/flavoured rice cakes, and a few pieces of bread (usually without <br/>\ntoppings of any kind).  Sometimes she&#39;ll have something different, like <br/>\npotato chips/fries, fish fingers, hash browns instead of the nuggets. She <br/>\nalmost never eats what we are having, even the meals that she used to eat <br/>\nwith us.  There are one or two meals she still will eat (baked potato, <br/>\npizza, though she only has bacon and pineapple on a pizza base without any <br/>\nother toppings), and we try to have these frequently.  She eats a fair bit <br/>\nof chocolate and other lollies.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not so much worried about what she&#39;s eating, as the fact that she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem happy about it.  She isn&#39;t looking forward to dinner, or any <br/>\nkind of food really (other than chocolate).  When we ask what she wants for <br/>\ndinner, she doesn&#39;t know, and often gets quite upset.  If we just served the <br/>\nfood we think she would like, or offered a selection on a platter, she will <br/>\nscream, and has on one or two occasions thrown the food across the room. <br/>\nShe really wants everyone to eat the same thing, but wants us to eat what <br/>\nshe&#39;s eating, not the other way around.  We try to do this where possible, <br/>\nby having a couple of nuggest with whatever we&#39;re having, which she seems <br/>\nsatisfied with for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe also often doesn&#39;t seem to eat enough during the day.  She will get <br/>\nquite grumpy and upset more than normal if she hasn&#39;t eaten, and won&#39;t <br/>\nrequest food if she&#39;s hungry.  I&#39;m not sure that she does actually feel <br/>\n&#39;hunger&#39;, or perhaps she doesn&#39;t recognise it?  I admit to being a little <br/>\nlike this myself.  I make a point of eating something for dinner and <br/>\nbreakfast, but often forget to eat for a lot of the rest of the day, so I do <br/>\nunderstand why she does it, but I don&#39;t yell at everyone when I&#39;m hungry. <br/>\nIt&#39;s even worse if we are visiting friends/playing at the park with friends, <br/>\nas she&#39;s so busy playing that she pretty much doesn&#39;t eat at all, and gets <br/>\nvery frustrated when her friends stop playing to eat.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has just gotten to the point where she will request a new food to try, <br/>\nand we make sure we get these whenever she asks.  Usually, she&#39;ll try them <br/>\nonce, and either decide she doesn&#39;t like them (not a problem), or try them, <br/>\nsay they&#39;re nice, but not eat more than one mouthful.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave we not being doing it for long enough for her to feel good about <br/>\neating?

I do love disentangling this kind of logic, but  <br/>\nsince November is National Novel Writing Month, I don&#39;t have as much  <br/>\ntime to dig into it as I&#39;d like. If anyone would like to respond, I  <br/>\ncan forward your thoughts onto her. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n====================<br/>\nHi,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a high school student and I was just reading around on your  <br/>\nwebsite. A lot of that logic is pretty mind-blowing and thought- <br/>\nprovoking. The part on chores especially; I was dead set against the  <br/>\nparents having to do the chores, but as I was reading through that, it  <br/>\ntruly opened my mind. However, I&#39;m still convinced that some things  <br/>\nare there that we all have to do as a child that help us later on.  <br/>\nPerhaps you could provide an alternate viewpoint to this idea? I&#39;d  <br/>\nreally appreciate that.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn your website (joyfullyrejoycing.com), you say that lots of times  <br/>\nmusic doesn&#39;t need that rote practice and all that people have used  <br/>\nfor many years. But I was reading an excerpt of that book that Amy  <br/>\nChua recently wrote about parenting (sorry, I forgot the title :) ),  <br/>\nand she brought up the good point that music is more fun when, plain  <br/>\nand simple, you&#39;re good at it. Now, I&#39;m not terribly great at my  <br/>\nviola, but I do have to agree that as I&#39;ve progressed, the joy I get  <br/>\nfrom playing the viola has increased. When I was kid I&#39;ll say it was  <br/>\ndefinitely quite fun to play an instrument; but I also enjoy a lot  <br/>\nnow. Perhaps the fact that one matures as he/she ages allows one&#39;s  <br/>\nenjoyment from something as deep as music to increase. But the fact of  <br/>\nthe matter is getting better at an instrument also brings joy to  <br/>\nplaying it. Some of the greatest moments are in an orchestra of your  <br/>\npeers just rocking out to a vibe everyone feels... But the  <br/>\nmusicianship of an orchestra can only increase when the people who  <br/>\nplay in it start to practice routinely, and work hard, even when they  <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to, at getting better, because they have that common goal  <br/>\nin mind. Hell, getting better at an instrument, period, requires daily  <br/>\npractice and nothing less. I&#39;m a pretty lazy practicer, and I&#39;m not so  <br/>\ngreat at the viola either :) Now, I agree that nothing would be as fun  <br/>\nas just playing my instrument with some of my friends for hours on  <br/>\nend, just hanging out. But is the experience of something where  <br/>\nthere&#39;s a requirement of skill level, achieved by practice and  <br/>\ndedication, worth pushing one&#39;s kid for? A child may not have the  <br/>\nforesight to realize that in five or six years they might be missing  <br/>\nout on something truly spectacular if they don&#39;t put the effort in  <br/>\nnow. Is it the obligation of the parents to push a kid when he/she is  <br/>\nlittle so that they can enjoy later?<br/>\n<br/>\n  The same might be said about math. When I was really little, like 3  <br/>\nand a half, my parents put me in an extracurricular math program that  <br/>\nwas just rote practice every single day with instruction once a week.  <br/>\nI did that for 10 years and the number of tantrums I threw probably  <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t be counted on the fingers of every person in New York City :)  <br/>\nBut after thousands of pages of math, I can honestly say that  <br/>\nmathematics piques my interest to no end. It&#39;s beautiful, interesting,  <br/>\nand that ability to do problems and calculations really quickly in my  <br/>\nhead helps in all facets of life. Do parents, once again, have the  <br/>\nobligation to set structure for a kid so that he/she can enjoy later?  <br/>\nThis might be considered the basis behind getting a kid into college  <br/>\nand what not.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose a counterargument might be... hmm, well you could say that  <br/>\nthis method is not necessary, that a kid may explore passions or  <br/>\ninterests in other fields. But doesn&#39;t it help to just give kids these  <br/>\noptions? For example, my parents will be fine with pretty much  <br/>\nanything somewhat practical I do later in life (no philosophy :( ).  <br/>\nThey don&#39;t need me to be a mathematician, engineer, musician, or  <br/>\nanything of the sort. I&#39;m sure they&#39;d be ok (grudgingly perhaps) if I  <br/>\nsay I want to be a historian or newspaper editor. So would you say  <br/>\nthat setting kids up with some interesting literature, history, etc.  <br/>\nthat they&#39;re interested in reading is good for them and setting them  <br/>\nup to be open to anything in the future? Basically what I&#39;m getting at  <br/>\nis is there a certain set of information that children should have,  <br/>\nthat they deserve to have so that they can pursue whatever they want  <br/>\nlater? If their interest wavers, is it important to keep a kid focused  <br/>\non something so that they can see the value of finishing something  <br/>\ncompletely?<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for all the questions; this is a really interesting topic and to  <br/>\nhear your viewpoint would mean a lot.
