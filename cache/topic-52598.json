Let him be a child and play freely in an environment you provide with his aspirations in mind. *****<br/>\n<br/>\nWe know a mom that does that.  Her intentions are/were good, but that isn&#39;t at all what her daughter feels about all that well intentioned &quot;free&quot; play and mom structured environment.  Mom saw that her daughter loved dance and is supporting that, has her daughter&#39;s whole future planned out, has structured her daughter&#39;s environment with those dance aspirations in mind.  There is no denying that her daughter loves to dance, loves taking classes, or that her mom isn&#39;t trying very hard to provide a supportive dance environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuess what&#39;s missing?  The child&#39;s voice.  It&#39;s simply that.  Her schedule is so full that she never gets to do any of the other things she likes.  Her mom doesn&#39;t see those things as bigger or better than that one aspiration that she&#39;s freely provided for.  That&#39;s what happens when parents start creating a child&#39;s environment in that way, the child gets lost in the equation, it becomes more about what mom wants and mom gets to feel good about all that wonderful stuff she&#39;s providing for her child.  Since it&#39;s all based on what the parent provides, even with the child&#39;s aspirations in mind, there isn&#39;t wiggle room for growth and change in that.  Once a parent decides for a child what the child&#39;s aspirations are, they&#39;ve stopped seeing the child as a person with aspirations with their own destinies.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat child ran away from home in deep frustration.  All she wanted to do was to have a little bit of time to just hang out with friends, freely hang out with friends with no mom involvement, no mom to provide for her aspirations and no mom creating her environment.  And that is what Joyce is saying when she says that this way of being won&#39;t work for most families!  There will always be kids that react to that kind of control, even well intentioned as it may be, even if the parent is really kind about all that free play and environment structuring.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Naomi Aldort on TV & junk food","postDate":"1271101542","msgId":52633,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI4M0Q4N0UxLTU3RTQtNEYxNC04OEM3LUZBOTQ2ODY1MTBDN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDJCRTAwRTc2LUIxRjAtNEM4Ri1BMDExLTcxRkMyRjNCMDk0M0BtYWMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDJCRTAwRTc2LUIxRjAtNEM4Ri1BMDExLTcxRkMyRjNCMDk0M0BtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":52631,"nextInTopic":52634,"prevInTime":52632,"nextInTime":52634,"topicId":52598,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Totally new to the concept of unschooling and to parenting in general, I was very confused with the opposite messages I was getting from Radical Unschoolers","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-599909\">-=-Totally new to the concept of unschooling and to parenting in  <br/>\ngeneral, I was very confused with the opposite messages I was getting  <br/>\nfrom Radical Unschoolers and from unschooling advocates like Naomi and  <br/>\nGatto.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHow new to parenting?<br/>\nTotally new?<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Taylor Gatto isn&#39;t &quot;an unschooling advocate.&quot;  He is a school  <br/>\nreform writer.

Sometimes, new ideas will never sit right and you&#39;ll need to decide that for yourself. It&#39;s really not a matter that someone&#39;s (who you&#39;ve identified as an &quot;expert&quot;) ideas negate the ideas and experiences of a group of parents who practice (live/breathe) whole-life unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can academically unschool without bringing the rest of the &quot;whole life&quot; idea into your lives (and then you may want to quietly unsubscribe from unschooling lists). When we decided to unschool &quot;for real&quot;, I had initially thought that&#39;s what we&#39;d do - academically unschool. The radical, however, just snuck in and started to permeate the rest of our lives and I realized I&#39;d have to carefully examine many of my biases -- and change my behaviour as a result (which I&#39;m working on all the time).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have Aldort&#39;s book. Other than skimming most of the book to figure out if I liked her S.A.L.V.E. technique, I didn&#39;t really get beyond her acknowledgements in terms of thinking deeply about her content. This is because she writes the most amazing thing on the 2nd page about her son, Jonathan. &quot;Jonathan, taught me, among other things, that no matter how loving and great a mother I may be, the child makes up his own movie of his childhood and this is the only childhood he has.&quot; This is the only thanks she offers this particular son (her eldest).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve thought a lot about that sentence since reading it. Is she saying that her child does not perceive her a loving and great mother? Is she saying she was &#39;great mother&#39; anyway, despite his feelings that he did not have a happy childhood and that he doesn&#39;t remember her as a great and loving mother? Is that relationship less than trusting and loving and this is her way of justifying that? Or her way of invalidating his feelings? <br/>\n<br/>\nOr? I have no idea but that sentence, which I remember verbatim, is the only thing that stuck with me. It troubled me a great deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn her book, Aldort does discuss limiting parental control of their children and the importance of trusting our children; but it seems, from her Natural Life column, that she&#39;s advocating control of the child through the environment or even directly (as per her TV and cookie comment in the first section). Perhaps she might be contradicting herself? She&#39;s not perfect and despite her claims of parental greatness and &quot;magic&quot;, I imagine she&#39;s just as human and fallible as the rest of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nAldort has many lovely things to say that support respectful parenting. However, when parents are really connected with their kids in this radical unschooling way, they don&#39;t need her S.A.L.V.E. technique (who can remember all the steps anyway when you are in the middle of something?) because they already have something much much better.

As a <br/>\nteenager, one of my sons wanted to play video games. He provided for me <br/>\npro and <br/>\ncon articles, which we both read and discussed for a couple of weeks.

If asked, my language <br/>\nwas simple, “This is how we do it based on my knowledge.” Or I engaged <br/>\nin a <br/>\nconversation that responded to a particular inquiry as much as the child wanted. <br/>\nThere is no need to protect your child from his family or apologize for <br/>\nbeing <br/>\nyou.

Clearly he was brushed off at first when he said he wanted to play video games. Clearly her belief that a child need not be the CEO of the family has gotten in the way of her children wanting to do what they want to do, it has stopped them from exploring the world in valuable and meaningful ways and they had to wait until they were in a position to research the articles required to demonstrate the value of the action they wanted to take. Clearly the environment that she provided didn&#39;t have his aspirations truly in mind. It is not as though I&#39;ve never been uncomfortable with things that Simon or Linnaea are interested in, but their interest was the source of my understanding that there was value in the thing. I didn&#39;t need them to do research on the pros and cons of whatever it was, I just needed to deal with my own problems with whatever on my own.

His enjoyment enriched my experience and my view of the show.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it fascinating when parents are sure that their children&#39;s embracing the limits they&#39;ve placed on them is evidence that those limits were good parenting tools. My dad spanked me because his dad spanked him because his dad spanked him and so on back up and through. That doesn&#39;t mean that spanking was a good parenting tool, but it was a known parenting tool. Dad passed it on because it was something that he believed was effective at harnassing his wild nature. Not time, not maturity, but the hitting of him as a child. And I passed it on until I realised, fully realised, that hitting a child was about my anger and not about their deeds. Simon and Linnaea could have grown up to believe that spanking was done with love and that &quot;it hurt me more than it hurt them.&quot; And they&#39;d believe that because believing that your parent is acting out of love is so very, very important to a child. Believing that the limitations that are arbitrarily set in place by<br/>\n your parents are there because they love you and they want you to have the best possible life is such a huge part of loving your parents.

I think, by reading the questions you asked, it might be helpful to understand what limitation does. It creates an artificial state of mind, where there is no freedom to make a real, personal choice. I will illustrate this statement with my own youth, because it is very fitting I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nI grew up without television for the first 11 years, and ended up sneaking to the neighbors to watch very nice, positive children&#39;s tv shows. When we did get a tv, we were limited to 1 hour per day. It created a huge amount of stress, sneakiness and arguments between me and my parents. My sisters didn&#39;t fight their decisions as much, they just sneakily watched tv when they could. The same goes for sugar.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of the lack of trust I experienced at my parents home, I left it early, and at 17 I moved to Amsterdam and got lost on every single subject my parents hadn&#39;t trust me with to make my own decisions. Alcohol, cigarettes, school, sex, clubbing, piercing, television: I had no control over these things, no personal view of what was right for me or what was wrong for me. I knew their thoughts, and I knew I didn&#39;t agree with the limits they set, so I just lost it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was very much in control over the things they had always left me free to do, and had never set any limits for. I had my own money at a very young age, bought my own clothing, cooked, did grocery shoppings, traveled the country and later the world very young and without their supervision, biked everywhere by myself.... those things have always been mine, I never wondered off my own path, have always been able to make my own decisions, and it kept me safe and made me strong. <br/>\n<br/>\n(it fits right in with one of the last paragraphs of Joyce&#39;s response:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I can pretty much guarantee that wouldn&#39;t work in most families! It could be her<br/>\n </span></blockquote>kids were very accepting and liked the security of someone making the decisions.<br/>\nAs a child I found comfort in knowing there was a &quot;right&quot; way for life to be so<br/>\nI didn&#39;t push the envelope. I don&#39;t know if my parents realized they just got<br/>\nlucky with my personality or if they thought their &quot;success&quot; with me was because<br/>\nof what they did. So her attitude would probably have worked with me. It<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have with my daughter though! And I know lots of kids question<br/>\n*everything* and wouldn&#39;t accept &quot;This is how we do it.&quot;&lt;  )<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would happen if you would trust your own children? Good things, bad things? What would have happened if your parents would have trusted you to make your own decisions as a child- would you have lost it, really?

They like them unabashedly and sometimes eat quite a bit, but on the other hand, nobody complains if we don&#39;t have candy in the house sometimes for a few weeks at a time--if someone says, &quot;I wish we had some chocolate,&quot; we will either look for a chance to get some, or bake something, or put it on the list for the next regular trip to the grocery store, depending on how urgent it feels.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the one hand, my kids sometimes eat so much candy at one time that if candy-restricting parents saw it, they&#39;d be appalled, be sure my kids were addicted, and feel vindicated. On the other hand, two summers ago I threw my sons a joint birthday party that included an elaborate ice-cream sundae bar with several kinds of ice cream and every cool topping I could think of. When I invited the kids to come have sundaes, the other kids all ran over immediately to start making theirs. Both of my kids were too busy with an activity we&#39;d been doing to stop and eat. They never did have sundaes during the party. They were glad their friends enjoyed them but sugar didn&#39;t exert such a strong pull on them that they&#39;d drop everything to have some.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I was not like that as a child. I was a sugar hound. At a birthday party, I&#39;d be thinking the whole time, &quot;when do we get cake...when do we get cake...how long until the cake.&quot; One reason I chose not to restrict my kids&#39; eating was that I did not want to feed that kind of obsession, if they were predisposed to it. I don&#39;t know, for me, how much was predisposition and how much was a response to scarcity, but I wonder if the predisposition would have manifested in that kind of out-of-control thinking and behavior without the environmental element as well.)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; ***** I am sure you have heard parents say, “Oh, come on, just be more loose and let her enjoy the cookies…it won’t kill her,” or, “Some TV is good for him.” Even unschooling parents tend to fall innocently into this habitual school-acquired trend of telling others to bend and fit into a common trend. *****<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Have you read any advice here that is merely opinion, that lacks analysis of real life data like the above?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat struck me about it was the idea that letting kids watch TV or eat cookies is a mindless (&quot;innocent&quot;) decision rather than one that has been carefully thought out. I hear this a lot among local homeschoolers who restrict sugar--that we moms who don&#39;t just &quot;don&#39;t know&quot; how bad it is, rather than that, say, we&#39;ve read all the same articles they have without being convinced. Or that we&#39;re more convinced by the arguments in something like the book &quot;Preventing Childhood Eating Problems,&quot; which advocates an environment of abundance and non-restriction.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I don&#39;t get how people can argue that there is no TV that is good for kids. Planet Earth? That&#39;s bad for kids? The Life of Birds?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; ***** Oliver, our youngest, has recently reflected on his childhood, saying those were the most happy years he can ever imagine. He said he recalls getting up each morning and feeling overjoyed with anticipation for the day. *****<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is she implying kids who have TV and sugar in their lives can&#39;t say the same? Based on what personal experience?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son Eric wakes up excited to get to whatever it is he wants to do. Sometimes that&#39;s running right to a video game--pretty often, actually. But sometimes it&#39;s continuing a Playmobil game with his brother or getting back to a Lego project he didn&#39;t finish the day before, or heading into his little sister&#39;s room to snuggle and watch SpongeBob with her. Sometimes he plays video games practically all day, and sometimes (less often) he doesn&#39;t play video games at all, and most days he does a whole big mix of things. One thing all his days have in common is that at the end of them, he likes to come cuddle with me in the recliner, and almost no matter what shape his day took, he says, &quot;I had a really good day today.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that kids who are being parented differently can also have this experience. But those parents should do me the favor of considering the possibility that yes, kids who have TV and sugar in their lives can also be tremendously happy.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; If control worked, every parent would be a genius at parenting. It takes no great skill to limit a child&#39;s world to what they parent believes is best. What&#39;s hard is maintaining the relationship. Some kids are compliant. Some kids may naturally have similar tastes to the parents. Some parents are so great at building the relationship in other ways that the parts that are closed off to them aren&#39;t as big a deal as they are to kids who feel disconnected from their parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know a couple of families locally who are homeschoolers but not unschoolers, where the moms are very much among my role models for respectful, loving, engaged parenting. They both do more structured homeschooling than we do, but they&#39;re also both families where the kids and the mom make decisions together about what to work on, and they&#39;re willing to switch gears if something doesn&#39;t work. The family invests a lot of resources in supporting the kids in their interests and explorations. I think that I could take that kind of approach with my son Carl, and it would be fine. It would not be fine with Eric (in fact, what I thought was a very gentle experiment in oh-so-slightly structured work on some reading and math concepts this past fall only reinforced how very much Eric needs not to feel like he&#39;s being pushed--lesson learned. Again. *sigh*).<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Not sure why it worked for her, but for millions of parents control fails spectacularly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a housemate, a young man who lives with us and does yardwork and childcare in exchange for his room (the boys love him--he knows all about video games, anime, manga, and he&#39;s a genius with the Legos). He grew up with a mom who allowed no sugar at all, no video games, no TV. He was allowed to have Playmobil toys but his mother took all the weapons away first, stuff like that. He has grown up to be a perfectly normal young man but he still carries a lot of pain from his mother&#39;s restrictions, and he once told me a story about how he would binge on sweets during weekends at his father&#39;s house. She thought she was making him strong and healthy, but it damaged their relationship. Sometimes he will say things to me like, &quot;Why would anybody do that to a kid?&quot;or &quot;Sometimes I wish my family weren&#39;t my family.&quot; It still hurts when he thinks about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sometimes joke that one of my parenting goals is that when my kids are grown and living on their own, and the phone rings and it&#39;s me, their immediate response isn&#39;t, &quot;Oh, shit, it&#39;s my mother.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; ***** You will protect him from alcohol, coffee, sugar, gambling, guns, violence, commercial seductions, streets, drugs, ocean waves, crime, certain areas of the city, etc. *****<br/>\n<br/>\nMy two-year-old daughter likes to drink my coffee in the morning. It&#39;s half-decaf, with cream. She takes a big sip, sets the cup down with a bang, and declares, &quot;Ummm, that good coffee!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOops. Failure to protect. I&#39;m going to try to do better about the violence and the drugs, though. I promise.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; There is no magic formula in what she says. She either doesn&#39;t know what else she was doing that made this &quot;work&quot; for her or her kids were content to go along with life as it was.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an unschooling parent, I do try to remind myself that what works for my kids may not work for others--or, as I said above, that what would be a disaster for Eric might be just fine with someone else&#39;s kids. It&#39;s easy to fall into the fallacy of generalizing to all kids from your own sample of one or two or three kids. (Though I was attracted to unschooling because I hoped that what unschooling parents were describing their family lives being like would be generalizable to mine!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a lot of fear in the kind of parenting that thinks even a tiny taste of TV or sugar will overwhelm children and damage them forever. I don&#39;t stick my head in the sand about problems in the world, but I don&#39;t want my kids to live in a culture of fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu, mom to Eric, 8; Carl, 6; Yehva, 2.5 </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Naomi Aldort on TV & junk food","postDate":"1271046005","msgId":52601,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFGNjc5NUZCLUM1QTEtNEJEMS1CQkRFLTc4MzVENjNDMjRGRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhwdTAxcitvYXBjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhwdTAxcitvYXBjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":52600,"nextInTopic":52602,"prevInTime":52600,"nextInTime":52602,"topicId":52598,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- I once went to a lecture by Alfie Kohn (author of Unconditional Parenting ) and asked him about his feelings on homeschooling/ unschooling.

She is saying children can&#39;t protect themselves from the (supposed) bad effects until they&#39;re older and more knowledgeable. One reason they can&#39;t protect themselves, she says, is the damage doesn&#39;t show up immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\n***** However, a child who “needs” candy or a movie is not free; the experience of candy or TV has created the illusion of a need. That which chooses is manipulated by the choice. The industry does a great job of manufacturing a sense of need. *****<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat real life children has she based these assumptions and conclusions on? Unschooled children who have been raised by connected parents who provide a rich supportive environment?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf what she was saying was true, always unschooled children should show far more profound effects of this damage than any other group of children. Have you been to an unschooling conference to see the effects on long time unschooling kids? Have you talked to long time unschoolers about what they&#39;ve actually experienced?<br/>\n<br/>\n***** In the formative years, passive external stimulations hinder a child’s freedom to be herself because they become part of what shapes her choices. For example, choosing sugar is shaped by the addictive nature of sugar; it is not a free choice. *****<br/>\n<br/>\nSo why aren&#39;t all radically unschooled kids sugar addicts?<br/>\n<br/>\n***** I am sure you have heard parents say, “Oh, come on, just be more loose and let her enjoy the cookies…it won’t kill her,” or, “Some TV is good for him.” Even unschooling parents tend to fall innocently into this habitual school-acquired trend of telling others to bend and fit into a common trend. *****<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you read any advice here that is merely opinion, that lacks analysis of real life data like the above?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you think this list is nothing more than a bunch of opinions based on what works for each of us, that there&#39;s no digging into the ideas, no observation of what really happens in families and why, no constant examination and questioning then you should be getting advice elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n***** In addition, children are capable of making wise choices when they can witness the results of their actions right away. But they have adult parents to guide and protect them from anything that has a long term harmful impact that they cannot foresee. *****<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the sticking places in understanding unschooling is expecting kids on their own to make the same decisions the parent would. If mom expects even a long time unschooling child to stop at one piece of candy or watch only the shows she thinks are quality or always prefer organic foods to their conventional counterparts she&#39;s setting herself up for disappointment and her child up for failure.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling isn&#39;t trusting the child to make mom&#39;s &quot;right&quot; decisions but for kids&#39; understanding of what&#39;s important to them to grow as they make choices and experience life. They will like things parents don&#39;t because their personalities and tastes are different, because their bodies are different, because the negative aspects are worth putting up with (for now) for the positive aspects.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance children tend to like sweet cereal when adults don&#39;t not because they haven&#39;t been taught what is best for their bodies (or because sugar is addictive). It&#39;s because they need lots of calories to grow. And they have small stomachs -- and lots of more interesting things to do -- so they need and prefer lots of calories in small packages often. To an adult a child&#39;s choices look poor but the kids are listening to their bodies.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat shouldn&#39;t be interpreted as &quot;Keep the candy bowl full and step back.&quot; It&#39;s a recognition of a biochemical reality. If you ask, people will have lots of ideas of what their kids liked when going through the fast growth stage. There are a lot of ideas on Sandra&#39;s monkey platter page.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/monkeyplatters\">http://sandradodd.com/monkeyplatters</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***** Clara: As a child, I was not allowed to have a Barbie doll and we didn’t have a TV, for which I’m forever grateful to my parents, even though it made me feel different from my peers at the time. *****<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy? What negative effect do you fear Barbies and TV would have had on you? What real life data do you base your fear on? Are they radically unschooled? Or conventionally parented schooled kids?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you know of or read first hand accounts of long time unschooled kids who&#39;ve ended up with the effects you fear?<br/>\n<br/>\n***** Why worship being like everyone else? *****<br/>\n<br/>\nAre people worshiping being like everyone else? Her language is emotionally manipulative.<br/>\n<br/>\nHumans are social creatures. We want connections with each other. Finding others who share interests and experiences is part of connecting. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchooled kids want connections too but there&#39;s an unhealthy aspect to their need for connection. Part of it is they&#39;ve been pulled from their family support to fend for themselves when they&#39;re not developmentally ready. They spend their childhood years seeking a substitute and for many kids it means taking on the likes and dislikes of a peer group so they&#39;ll be accepted.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut exploring what other people find interesting is part of the process of connecting to others. When we first moved into our house my daughter and the girl across the street, Stephanie, made some attempts at friendship. Kathryn loved pretending with animals and Stephanie loved dolls. For a while Kathryn enjoyed playing dolls with Stephanie and said she liked how Stephanie played with them. (She obviously brought a passion about dolls to their play.) But the friendship fizzled and my daughter went back to her animals and ignored the few dolls she had. It wasn&#39;t a peer pressure thing or a way to be like everyone else. It was an avenue to connect with someone else. But what the avenue connected to wasn&#39;t drawing enough for Kathryn to keep up an interest without Stephanie.<br/>\n<br/>\n***** Much TV and junk toys and foods can be the cause of the child’s loss of freedom. *****<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, what&#39;s the foundation of this statement? What radically unschooled kids is she basing it on?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter isn&#39;t addicted to either TV or sugar even though she&#39;s had free access to both for 18 years. She doesn&#39;t over power a desire to watch TV or eat sugar with knowledge. She chooses what she prefers to do and eat based on personal preferences. Neither TV nor sugar are prominent in her life by her own choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n***** I kept our home stocked with only healthy food and natural tools of art, play, and learning, and I stirred our family social connections with awareness. As a result, my children were free to do as they wished and didn’t experience restrictions. *****<br/>\n<br/>\nThat statement doesn&#39;t make logical sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs she saying that if she&#39;d had TV and conventional foods that her kids would have felt restrictions? Or that she would have restricted them?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m guessing, based on the above, she&#39;s saying the addictive nature of TV and sugar would have imposed restrictions. But she&#39;s just guessing based on her own fears.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s funny that once someone removes the addiction-colored glasses the behavior they saw as addiction becomes engagement and interest.<br/>\n<br/>\n***** Oliver, our youngest, has recently reflected on his childhood, saying those were the most happy years he can ever imagine. He said he recalls getting up each morning and feeling overjoyed with anticipation for the day. *****<br/>\n<br/>\nIs she implying kids who have TV and sugar in their lives can&#39;t say the same? Based on what personal experience?<br/>\n<br/>\n***** Clara: Many unschoolers’ view is that banning something tells the child he isn’t as powerful as the thing, so someone must keep it away from him. *****<br/>\n<br/>\nYou left off the rest of discussion. That&#39;s the problem with learning through &quot;sound bites.&quot;  The full picture gets lost.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s no secret to kids that the world is bigger and more powerful than they are. Naomi implies that unschoolers suggest lying to the child to tell them they&#39;re more powerful when they aren&#39;t. Please show where someone has said that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat unschoolers have said is to work with the child to tackle the problem and find ways to deal with it. In the process of figuring out how to overcome the obstacles in safe and respectful ways, the child will gain a better understanding of the problem and they&#39;ll also be reassessing whether they really want to tackle it or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example is older kids going to parties where there might be drinking. There are more choices than blithely letting the child go ignoring all the problems that might happen and telling the child no and explaining all the things that could go wrong that the child might not be able to handle. Better is to empower the child. Strategies like letting them know they can always have a ride home no matter what, no questions asked, providing a cell phone, building up a habit of calling home to let the parents know if they&#39;re going somewhere else and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t apply to TV and sugar, though. Radically unschooled kids aren&#39;t being overpowered by either.<br/>\n<br/>\n***** The child does have the power to face her own weaknesses and to stay away from things – initially with your guidance and, later, on her own. *****<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the strategy conventional parents use which often results in rebellious teens.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that the attitude you would like your husband to have towards you? How would it make you feel if he did? Yes, you&#39;re an adult and have a different relationship but imagine how you&#39;d feel. Children are just as human and prefer people who want to help them approach an obstacle rather than explain why they can&#39;t. Kids are already aware that they have less power than adults. They&#39;ve lived with that their whole life.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if you replace the child in the above scenario with a handicapped person? Handicapped people are already to well aware of the obstacles they face. They want to find ways around the obstacles to get what they want.<br/>\n<br/>\n***** We can avoid controlling by not exposing in the first place and by providing clear and kind leadership. Children yearn for parental guidance and are powerful enough to not always get their way. *****<br/>\n<br/>\nJust picture a man giving that advice to another man about how his relationship with his new wife should be.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you thought that attitude would damage your relationship with a friend or partner, why do you think it would not damage a relationship with a child?<br/>\n<br/>\n***** Clara: I’ve heard from unschoolers that kids who aren’t limited treat TV a lot like they treat books: as a resource. Is that really true? *****<br/>\n<br/>\nWhoa. Why are you asking her if what we&#39;re saying is true? Do you think we&#39;re lying???<br/>\n<br/>\n***** As a teenager, one of my sons wanted to play video games. He provided for me pro and con articles, which we both read and discussed for a couple of weeks. We concluded that it was fine for him. He was into these games very part-time for about two years. *****<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if you wanted to try something new like clog dancing and you had to provide pro and con articles and discuss it with your husband for a couple of weeks? Would it be wonderful if all that he agreed it would be fine for you?<br/>\n<br/>\n***** In their late teens, two of our sons tried junk food for a while and came to value healthy eating and lifestyle even more. The youngest is not interested in junk food even when away from home. *****<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd?? My daughter has had the freedom to eat convenience foods her whole life and prefers to eat the way my husband I eat.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf control worked, every parent would be a genius at parenting. It takes no great skill to limit a child&#39;s world to what they parent believes is best. What&#39;s hard is maintaining the relationship. Some kids are compliant.

You can even get people to want something they weren&#39;t interested in by telling them they can&#39;t have it ;-) <br/>\n<br/>\n***** TV has never become an attraction in their teen and adult lives. *****<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd? My daughter watches a lot of videos of 80&#39;s rock groups because that&#39;s her passion but she doesn&#39;t watch much regular TV. Not because she doesn&#39;t like it! But because she has so many other things she&#39;s choosing to do first.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;never become an attraction&quot; attitude bothers me. I think it suggests TV has no redeeming value and the only reason someone would watch it was because of &quot;attraction&quot;, like being manipulated or mesmerized. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if someone kept books from their child and once grown said &quot;Books have never become an attraction in their teen and adult lives.&quot; Doesn&#39;t something sound off about it?<br/>\n<br/>\n***** You will protect him from alcohol, coffee, sugar, gambling, guns, violence, commercial seductions, streets, drugs, ocean waves, crime, certain areas of the city, etc. *****<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter has had access to a lot of that and yet she hasn&#39;t embraced any of them at 18. She even works at Starbucks and hasn&#39;t developed a daily coffee habit even though she gets free drinks all day long. Even though we both drink lattes she usually chooses non-caffeinated drinks while she works.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t need to protect her. I gave her information over the years not to make her make the right choices but for her to use when she made choices. She&#39;s had sips of alcohol and prefers non-alcohol. (I had the same as a kid and also prefer non-alcohol.) Maybe it&#39;s genetics but others have said the same. <br/>\n<br/>\n***** You will also insist on him wearing a seat-belt in a car, a helmet on a bike, and other restrictions for his protection, or to accommodate laws or the needs of others. Your own life isn’t without things being off limits either and you are fine. Your son can handle reality and is counting on your management. *****<br/>\n<br/>\nHer &quot;reality&quot; is that TV and sugar and non-organic foods and video games are dangerous like riding without a seatbelt. But if so the evidence should be glaringly obvious in radically unschooled kids but it isn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n***** When happy with what is, a child does not search for what isn’t. *****<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure that&#39;s great! Is the goal to create kids who are happy with what the parent has exposed them to? Honestly that sounds like a science fiction scenario to create the perfect society so people are content with what the government gives them.<br/>\n<br/>\n***** Happiness and self-reliance have nothing to do with the child getting whatever she wants and everything to do with freedom from commercial manipulation. *****<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, where&#39;s her data to back up her statement? How does she explain radically unschooled kids who are happy and self-reliant when they&#39;ve had free access to commercial TV and a partner who helps them find ways that are safe and respectful to do what they want?<br/>\n<br/>\n***** Clara: I’d be very interested in the language you use when explaining your family’s choice to eat a certain way or to not watch TV at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaomi: I often said nothing and life simply went on. If asked, my language was simple, “This is how we do it based on my knowledge.” Or I engaged in a conversation that responded to a particular inquiry as much as the child wanted. There is no need to protect your child from his family or apologize for being you. It is a burden for a child to get explanations for everything. He need not be the CEO of the family. Give him a break. Let him be a child and play freely in an environment you provide with his aspirations in mind. *****<br/>\n<br/>\nI can pretty much guarantee that wouldn&#39;t work in most families! It could be her kids were very accepting and liked the security of someone making the decisions. As a child I found comfort in knowing there was a &quot;right&quot; way for life to be so I didn&#39;t push the envelope. I don&#39;t know if my parents realized they just got lucky with my personality or if they thought their &quot;success&quot; with me was because of what they did. So her attitude would probably have worked with me. It wouldn&#39;t have with my daughter though! And I know lots of kids question *everything* and wouldn&#39;t accept &quot;This is how we do it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no magic formula in what she says. She either doesn&#39;t know what else she was doing that made this &quot;work&quot; for her or her kids were content to go along with life as it was.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77228268,"authorName":"Marla","from":"&quot;Marla&quot; &lt;marla@...&gt;","profile":"hilltowner4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Naomi Aldort on TV & junk food","postDate":"1271038843","msgId":52600,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhwdTAxcitvYXBjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDJCRTAwRTc2LUIxRjAtNEM4Ri1BMDExLTcxRkMyRjNCMDk0M0BtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":52599,"nextInTopic":52601,"prevInTime":52599,"nextInTime":52601,"topicId":52598,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hey Clara, Great question.

I&#39;ve thought about this alot, too.  I once went to a lecture by Alfie Kohn (author of &quot;Unconditional Parenting&quot;) and asked him about his feelings on homeschooling/ unschooling.  At that time he felt that the best education was one that included a leader, who introduced a topic and ways to explore it, and a group of peers to work with each other on it.  I&#39;ve also spoken to Naomi on occasion and read many of her articles and her book and don&#39;t always feel completely comfortable with her point of view.  I think I sometimes feel guilty of being a bad parent after reading her articles.  Not always, but on occasion.  I still think she has some cool stuff to say, though.  I think that it is important to explore what you feel and believe is important and true to you and your family and leave the rest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that helps!<br/>\n<br/>\nMarla</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":366686190,"authorName":"claramont@mac.com","from":"claramont@...","profile":"clara_bellar","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Naomi Aldort on TV & junk food","postDate":"1271014573","msgId":52598,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJCRTAwRTc2LUIxRjAtNEM4Ri1BMDExLTcxRkMyRjNCMDk0M0BtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":52599,"prevInTime":52597,"nextInTime":52599,"topicId":52598,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"A few months ago, I asked Naomi Aldort some questions about TV & junk food, after joining a couple of radical unschooling groups.
