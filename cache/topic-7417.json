Since I haven&#39;t lived there for many years, I wonder<br/>\nif there&#39;s more to do there than there used to be.  I guess you could<br/>\nlook at the weather as nice if it&#39;s not summer, but I still say there&#39;s<br/>\nno place in the world worse than Houston in the summer.  I always feel<br/>\nin a bind when I think about taking my kids to visit Texas.  I&#39;d like<br/>\nthem to see where I grew up, but I still think of it as being a kind of<br/>\nyucky city.
