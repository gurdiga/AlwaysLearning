She was encouraging people to &quot;be brave&quot;  <br/>\nin their thinking - to consider all options, to really open our minds  <br/>\nand consider possibilities that we might normally automatically  <br/>\nreject. She said it was safe to think &quot;dangerous thoughts&quot; and that  <br/>\nif we were afraid, to duct-tape ourselves to a chair and get someone  <br/>\nto be a spotter for us and just sit there and think all the dangerous  <br/>\nthoughts we could. She said that when we were done, we&#39;d still be  <br/>\nthere, still in that chair, nobody else would even KNOW what we&#39;d  <br/>\nthought, and, if we wanted, we could go on as if we&#39;d never thought  <br/>\nthose thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI took it as a challenge - the idea that I was self-censoring my own  <br/>\nthinking hadn&#39;t even ever occurred to me (censored, itself &lt;g&gt;). So  <br/>\nright there, in the conference, I tried to rummage around in my brain  <br/>\nand see if I could find something to think about that was  <br/>\n&quot;dangerous.&quot; I remember one of the things I thought was: &quot;Maybe I  <br/>\nshould never have had kids because I might be an awful parent and  <br/>\nruin their lives.&quot; Another thing I thought was, &quot;I really wasted many  <br/>\nyears in school while I focused on being the &quot;good&quot; student and  <br/>\nworrying about pleasing teachers.&quot; I didn&#39;t write all these things  <br/>\ndown - I just edged toward ideas in my head and was aware when I had  <br/>\nthe urge to look the other way and I made myself pay attention. It  <br/>\nwas amazing - incredibly liberating. I WAS afraid to let go and do it  <br/>\ntoo much - afraid that I&#39;d embarrass myself by speaking out loud or  <br/>\nsomething. But I was forever changed right then and there.
