Its a great resource,<br/>\nespecially with all the links to others&#39; sites, too.<br/>\n-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really grateful to all the people who have written such great  <br/>\nthings over the years and let me use them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s like a quilt made out of other people&#39;s cloth, most of the  <br/>\npages.  Probably less than half of what&#39;s there is my writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people wish it was organized so they could read it all and know  <br/>\nthey had, but it&#39;s not. &lt;g&gt;  And by the time they could get all the  <br/>\nway through there would be something else added anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nI admire the organization of Joyce&#39;s page:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/\">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it was new, a person could read it all.<br/>\nI think it has recently passed that point.  If someone read really  <br/>\nfast, maybe... but Joyce is starting to add other people&#39;s writings  <br/>\ntoo, and I think by the time you finished, some pages would have been  <br/>\nadded to, and new pages added.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think that&#39;s a bad thing at all! &lt;g&gt;  If people poke around  <br/>\nand follow links and get ideas to try, and then they go be with their  <br/>\nkids for hours or days and only come back when they need to, my site  <br/>\nwill be doing exactly what I hoped it would do, which is put some  <br/>\nhelpful ideas where people can find them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my favorite pages these days is this:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/learning\">http://sandradodd.com/learning</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe links at the bottom look better on my Mac than on Marty&#39;s or  <br/>\nHolly&#39;s PCs but on any of them, if you make the window narrower or  <br/>\nwider it all moves around.  It was fun to do links without words.   <br/>\nIt&#39;s an adventure for the reader.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning]Reading Sandra&#39;s website","postDate":"1170009067","msgId":27858,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVwaXE1Yit0bzhwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFmYTNlNzYxMDcwMTI4MDYzMXgyOGU3MDdkOHQ4ZWQ3MGY2M2M2NGFmYzE5QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":27853,"nextInTopic":27866,"prevInTime":27857,"nextInTime":27859,"topicId":27853,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... to back ...
