Sometimes they are willfully ignorant of human  <br/>\n&gt; development and will swat a baby for not &quot;minding&quot; (or for crying, or  <br/>\n&gt; not making it to the toilet).  They don&#39;t &quot;know their children&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; better than anybody.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If someone is thinking today, April 10, of changing the way they are,  <br/>\n&gt; today&#39;s the day to do it.  Tomorrow might be too late.  This  <br/>\n&gt; afternoon might be too late.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A friend of mine knew she should have unschooled.  She KNEW her kids  <br/>\n&gt; hated school.  They told her so.  Teachers told her so.  She didn&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; want her routine to be disturbed, though, and she didn&#39;t want the  <br/>\n&gt; responsibility, and she didn&#39;t think she could spend time with her  <br/>\n&gt; kids.  So she said she would send them to elementary and when they  <br/>\n&gt; got to midschool age (11, 12) she would homeschool them.  By the time  <br/>\n&gt; they were that old, the relationship was shot and they liked school  <br/>\n&gt; and schoolkids better than they liked their mom, and the bad  <br/>\n&gt; relationships at their house had caused such friction and stress that  <br/>\n&gt; the mother had told the dad to leave, at which point he did (only he  <br/>\n&gt; went just as far as the storage shed and shot himself).   There was a  <br/>\n&gt; point when it wasn&#39;t too late.  There were MANY points.  But there  <br/>\n&gt; was a point when it was too late.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If &quot;it&#39;s never too late&quot; is true, then NOBODY needs to change, ever,  <br/>\n&gt; because it&#39;s never too late.  Tomorrow is fine.  Maybe in a few years  <br/>\n&gt; is fine.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If someone is deciding whether to stop spanking and she doesn&#39;t do  <br/>\n&gt; it, IT&#39;S TOO LATE to stop today.  If she spanks again Saturday and  <br/>\n&gt; again on Easter because they didn&#39;t carry the eggs right, or keep  <br/>\n&gt; their clothes clean, it is TOO LATE to have that week back, to have  <br/>\n&gt; that peaceful laughter back.  Once a child is crying because a mother  <br/>\n&gt; has been mean, it&#39;s too late for her to undo that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can she do better in the very next moment?  YES, if she wants to.  If  <br/>\n&gt; she has ideas about what &quot;better&quot; would be.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When someone coos about another mother she doesn&#39;t even know and says  <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Oooh, you&#39;re such a good mother; your children are lucky to have  <br/>\n&gt; you,&quot; that can be just the bandaid that praised mom needs to go  <br/>\n&gt; another week or two being neglectful and cruel.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It can be too late to decide to nurse a baby.<br/>\n&gt; It can be too late to decide to feed on demand.<br/>\n&gt; It can be too late to practice the family bed, and pick up a baby  <br/>\n&gt; every time he cries.<br/>\n&gt; It can be too late to stay home with babies instead of putting them  <br/>\n&gt; in daycare.<br/>\n&gt; It can be too late to keep kids home instead of putting them in  <br/>\n&gt; preschool.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Something intended to simply encourage the mother of a teen that  <br/>\n&gt; changing now is better than not changing at all (which is good  <br/>\n&gt; encouragement, but doesn&#39;t need platitudes) runs the danger of  <br/>\n&gt; encouraging the mother of a three or four year old from making moves  <br/>\n&gt; NOW to avoid any more harm to the child or the relationship.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This reminds me of a hurtful argument my mother and i had about me<br/>\nquitting smoking last week. She really offended me by making a remark<br/>\nabout me leaving my children without a mother. I can see her point<br/>\nbetter now after reading this, though i feel she could have stated<br/>\nthings differently and less harassingly. I have tried to quit smoking<br/>\n several times throughout the past year, and i felt she was being<br/>\nharassing as though i don&#39;t realize how important it is to quit. But i<br/>\njust wanted to share that i noticed this philosophy can be applied to<br/>\nanything we need to do to better ourselves, not just our parenting.

It&#39;s about the danger of platitudes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; I completely agree...it is never too late.  Though I would love the<br/>\n  &gt; opportunity to have an adult relationship with my mom (she died in  <br/>\n  &gt; 1991)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Then what does &quot;it&#39;s never too late&quot; MEAN when someone is dead?<br/>\n  It&#39;s too late.<br/>\n<br/>\n  In the past few weeks two children of moms I met through unschooling  <br/>\n  have died.  One was nine.  One was 20.  Anything those moms saved to  <br/>\n  do later... it&#39;s too late.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t like platitudes like &quot;You know your children better than  <br/>\n  anyone&quot; and &quot;You&#39;re the expert when it comes to your children,&quot;  <br/>\n  because frankly sometimes mothers are NOT talented in any knowledge- <br/>\n  of-other-people way.  Sometimes they are willfully ignorant of human  <br/>\n  development and will swat a baby for not &quot;minding&quot; (or for crying, or  <br/>\n  not making it to the toilet).  They don&#39;t &quot;know their children&quot;  <br/>\n  better than anybody.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If someone is thinking today, April 10, of changing the way they are,  <br/>\n  today&#39;s the day to do it.  Tomorrow might be too late.  This  <br/>\n  afternoon might be too late.<br/>\n<br/>\n  A friend of mine knew she should have unschooled.  She KNEW her kids  <br/>\n  hated school.  They told her so.  Teachers told her so.  She didn&#39;t  <br/>\n  want her routine to be disturbed, though, and she didn&#39;t want the  <br/>\n  responsibility, and she didn&#39;t think she could spend time with her  <br/>\n  kids.  So she said she would send them to elementary and when they  <br/>\n  got to midschool age (11, 12) she would homeschool them.  By the time  <br/>\n  they were that old, the relationship was shot and they liked school  <br/>\n  and schoolkids better than they liked their mom, and the bad  <br/>\n  relationships at their house had caused such friction and stress that  <br/>\n  the mother had told the dad to leave, at which point he did (only he  <br/>\n  went just as far as the storage shed and shot himself).   There was a  <br/>\n  point when it wasn&#39;t too late.  There were MANY points.  But there  <br/>\n  was a point when it was too late.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  If &quot;it&#39;s never too late&quot; is true, then NOBODY needs to change, ever,  <br/>\n  because it&#39;s never too late.  Tomorrow is fine.  Maybe in a few years  <br/>\n  is fine.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If someone is deciding whether to stop spanking and she doesn&#39;t do  <br/>\n  it, IT&#39;S TOO LATE to stop today.  If she spanks again Saturday and  <br/>\n  again on Easter because they didn&#39;t carry the eggs right, or keep  <br/>\n  their clothes clean, it is TOO LATE to have that week back, to have  <br/>\n  that peaceful laughter back.  Once a child is crying because a mother  <br/>\n  has been mean, it&#39;s too late for her to undo that.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Can she do better in the very next moment?  YES, if she wants to.  If  <br/>\n  she has ideas about what &quot;better&quot; would be.<br/>\n<br/>\n  When someone coos about another mother she doesn&#39;t even know and says  <br/>\n  &quot;Oooh, you&#39;re such a good mother; your children are lucky to have  <br/>\n  you,&quot; that can be just the bandaid that praised mom needs to go  <br/>\n  another week or two being neglectful and cruel.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It can be too late to decide to nurse a baby.<br/>\n  It can be too late to decide to feed on demand.<br/>\n  It can be too late to practice the family bed, and pick up a baby  <br/>\n  every time he cries.<br/>\n  It can be too late to stay home with babies instead of putting them  <br/>\n  in daycare.<br/>\n  It can be too late to keep kids home instead of putting them in  <br/>\n  preschool.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Something intended to simply encourage the mother of a teen that  <br/>\n  changing now is better than not changing at all (which is good  <br/>\n  encouragement, but doesn&#39;t need platitudes) runs the danger of  <br/>\n  encouraging the mother of a three or four year old from making moves  <br/>\n  NOW to avoid any more harm to the child or the relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  SPONSORED LINKS Unschooling  Attachment parenting  John holt  <br/>\n        Parenting magazine  Single parenting  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  YAHOO!

Though I would love the<br/>\nopportunity to have an adult relationship with my mom (she died in 1991), I<br/>\nfirmly believe that 1) the things that happened in my childhood made me<br/>\nstronger and 2) happened for a reason...whatever reasons those may be.  I<br/>\nlearned patience and unconditional love from her, I learned how to respect<br/>\nothers and command respect through respect...I did not learn this through<br/>\nher parenting per se (she was old school and we got spanked a lot), I<br/>\nlearned it through watching her with other adults.  I just happened to be<br/>\nperceptive enough as a child to learn those lessons second hand.  The<br/>\ndownfall is since I did not learn that kids deserve respect as well (are not<br/>\nless than adults), I parented very much like my parents (without the<br/>\nconsistent spanking...though I did spank &quot;for safety&quot; and &quot;last resort&quot;).  I<br/>\nwas very authoritative...until I started learning about unschooling and the<br/>\nentire lifestyle this year.  I am slowly educating my dh in the methods and<br/>\nwe are slowly mending the relationship with my 11 year old ds and hope to<br/>\nhave it mended for the most part before our now 15 mo old gets the &quot;product<br/>\nof our old parenting style&quot; modeled for him too long.  <br/>\n <br/>\nKeep doing what you are doing, parent from the heart unconditionally, live<br/>\nthe unschooling life and just know in your heart that your kids....newborn<br/>\nto 100 will benefit from it, heck the people around you will benefit from it<br/>\nas well.  You may not only change your immediate families life, you may<br/>\nchange many many other lives in the process...what we do/model touches more<br/>\npeople than you can ever know.  So don&#39;t stop with just your kids, extend<br/>\nout to your parents/grandparents/everyone you know...make it a way of life<br/>\nALL THE TIME with EVERYONE.  Who knows, if we touch enough people...we might<br/>\nsucceed in world peace...eventually!  It all starts with you and you are the<br/>\nonly person you can change...others will see you living happier and through<br/>\nyour modeling, will choose to change (or not).  Just know you are doing the<br/>\nbest you can for you...and know that you have always done the best you could<br/>\nwith the knowledge you had at the time...learning (even about parenting) is<br/>\na life long process.
