I had sent him","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-154116036\">I was watching a bunch of Kahn Academy videos this morning and I thought it might be fun to invite my 12 year old son to watch some with me.  I had sent him the link to the Khan Academy before, but was pretty sure he hadn&#39;t looked at the site on his own.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter scrolling through the vast list of topics, he settled on the &quot;Developmental Math&quot; category.  My son really likes playing around with numbers, and when he gets that generic, &quot;What&#39;s your favorite subject?&quot; question from someone, he almost always says &quot;Math,&quot; which I find so funny and awesome. <br/>\n <br/>\nWe were looking through the topics and I asked him if he remembered how to multiply two digit numbers.  We had seen a video of a man who did it by using a method where you put the numbers on a kind of grid, hard to explain in words but if you are interested, it looks like this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSqDIcPSXLY&feature=plcp&context=C3c85a4cUDOEgsToPDskJHckG9EwHn9Il5jpW5mgoY\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSqDIcPSXLY&feature=plcp&context=C3c85a4cUDOEgsToPDskJHckG9EwHn9Il5jpW5mgoY</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHe said he remembered how to multiply two digit numbers.  I said, &quot;Can you show me?&quot;  And I wrote down 27 x 33, (but I wrote it one number on top of the other, not in a line like I just typed it.)  Then I grabbed the calculator and punched the numbers in so I&#39;d have the answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI expected him to draw the grid and start working on it, but he just sat there.  After a little while I said, &quot;You don&#39;t remember how to do it?&quot; and he said, &quot;I&#39;m doing it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe 20 seconds later he said, &quot;891.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI showed him the calculator.  It felt like a magician&#39;s reveal, like &quot;is this your card?&quot;  We both got tickled and laughed and laughed.  I asked him to explain to me how he got his answer.  It took a few times of him explaining for me to grasp what he did and how he got the right answer.  Basically he multiplied 33 x 30 in his head and got 990, then subtracted 99, because 27 is 3 less than thirty, or 3 33s less.  All this in his head.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust wanted to share one of those great unschooling moments.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennie</div>","specialLinks":[{"url":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/JSqDIcPSXLY?wmode=opaque","type":"VIDEO"}]}],"prevTopicId":65406,"nextTopicId":65381}}
