Now I use it more for *me* when I&#39;m triggered <br/>\nby his behavior, it gives me that necessary space from the situation to <br/>\ncalmly decide what to do.  We&#39;ve also used some individual flower <br/>\nessences for other issues:<br/>\nWhen Hayden was asked &quot;red shirt or blue?&quot; he would choose one and <br/>\nruminate all day that he made the wrong choice, we used Cerato:<br/>\n*&gt;&gt;Cerato*: This Essence helps you when you have a hard time making <br/>\ndecisions. When you have to make a decision; such as, where to live, <br/>\nwhat to wear or where to go. You tend to seek advise and confirmations <br/>\nfrom others, not listening to your own intuition. You might often follow <br/>\nothers advise and later regret is, since you actually knew that it <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be what you wanted.*  Cerato* helps you listening to your own <br/>\nwisdom and follow it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, when I was/am on the verge of behaving as I don&#39;t want to, I use <br/>\nCherry Plum:<br/>\n*&gt;&gt;Cherry Plum:* This helps you when you are on the verge of breakdown, <br/>\npossible suicide. You feel in such despair that you feel that you are <br/>\nloosing your sanity. You have a feeling that you are going to explode <br/>\nand are afraid to give way to violent impulses. *Cherry Plum *helps you <br/>\nto find an inner balance so that you can think and act rationally.<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep a few others on hand in case I feel the need, sometimes just <br/>\nknowing they&#39;re here helps.  I&#39;ve often sent Hayden into stressful <br/>\nsituations with RR in his pocket and he holds it when he needs to (i.e. <br/>\nafternoon at gramma&#39;s house), but rarely doses himself. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow outside of medicine, I *HIGHLY* recommend Sandra&#39;s Peaceful <br/>\nParenting tape.

Rather than being their director, <br/>\nbe their facilitator.<br/>\n You can be with them. You can enter into their world and help them get what <br/>\nthey&#39;re trying to get and explore what they&#39;re trying to explore.<br/>\n<br/>\n If you were watching a favorite movie would you rather that a parent had <br/>\nignored you, yelled at you to turn it off, made snide remarks about you watching <br/>\ntrash, or sat beside you and talked about the movie as a friend might, sharing <br/>\nwhat you each like and didn&#39;t like about it?<br/>\n<br/>\n It helps to appreciate that they are perfect as who they are right now and <br/>\nnot try to focus on them not being what they should be as adults. What I mean <br/>\nby that is that we shouldn&#39;t see a 4 yo who hits as signs that he&#39;ll be an <br/>\nadult who hits. We shouldn&#39;t see it as something that needs trained out of them or <br/>\nthey&#39;ll be stuck with it. We should see it as perfectly natural for who they <br/>\nare and they need help figuring out better ways to handle their emotions.<br/>\n<br/>\n A sitting 9 mo old isn&#39;t destined to be a sitting adult ;-) They will grow <br/>\nand change because it&#39;s natural, not because we&#39;ve trained them to do something <br/>\nelse. They may even run a marathon in there, but it won&#39;t be because we <br/>\ntrained them not to sit ;-) If we trust that kids don&#39;t want to be hurtful and just <br/>\nneed help gaining the skills to stop themselves and figure out new ways, then <br/>\nit&#39;s easier to change the role we take on in their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\n ===My son is extremely spirited, so am I, so we do clash a lot.===<br/>\n<br/>\n Have you read some of the books people often recommend for challenging <br/>\nchildren? Raising Your Spirited Child by Mary Sheedy Kurcinka and The Explosive <br/>\nChild by Dr. Ross Greene.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===The other day I told him that I wanted him to pick up his toys in his <br/>\nroom, he opened his bedroom window and started yelling for someone to get his dad <br/>\nand to help him! I hadn&#39;t even yelled at him, he just didn&#39;t want to clean his <br/>\nroom!===<br/>\n<br/>\n What if your husband wanted you to reroof the house? What if you knew that <br/>\nif he suggested something that was it, period, there was no getting out of it? <br/>\nHe might help you. He might work along side of you. But when he wanted you to <br/>\ndo something, he was depositing the burden of the task on your shoulders and <br/>\nyou were going to have to get up on that roof and strip it down and nail down <br/>\nnew shingles regardless of your feelings about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cleaning up seems much smaller than that to us as adults, but from inside <br/>\nkids cleaning up feels like reroofing the house.<br/>\n<br/>\n What if your son didn&#39;t like the way you kept your room? What if he came in <br/>\nand told you to put your stuff away in the way he thought it best. The first <br/>\ntime it might be amusing ;-) After weeks of his seemingly whimsical demands <br/>\nabout how you keep your stuff and your corner of the world that you didn&#39;t have <br/>\nthe option to ignore, how would you feel?<br/>\n<br/>\n If the room bothers you, then ask if he wouldn&#39;t mind if you cleaned it up. <br/>\nJudge for yourself whether you should ask if he&#39;d like to help right now. If <br/>\nhe&#39;s used to you &quot;asking&quot; when you are really telling him (that is when you <br/>\n&quot;ask&quot; &quot;no&quot; isn&#39;t an acceptable answer) then it&#39;s not going to sound like a <br/>\nquestion. Or he may think it&#39;s a way to manipulate him into helping.<br/>\n<br/>\n See the task as yours because it&#39;s something important to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n ===We also have a hard time with him acting out because he has asthma and <br/>\nallergies. When they are full swing, he physically can&#39;t control himself and he <br/>\nwill sometimes get too rough with my 15 month old.===<br/>\n<br/>\n Rather than labeling it &quot;acting out&quot; which focuses on the action, look at <br/>\nwhat he&#39;s feeling inside and why he&#39;s behaving as he does.<br/>\n<br/>\n Talk to him at calm times about what he&#39;s feeling before he gets rough. He <br/>\nneeds that awareness of what&#39;s going on internally before he can even attempt <br/>\nto figure out how to deal with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n At 4 -- or even at 6 or 10 or 27! -- he may not know what to do so you&#39;ll <br/>\nneed to go slowly and not pressure him. He may not even realize there&#39;s a build <br/>\nup. Ask him if he can pay attention next time. Maybe have him talk about what <br/>\nwas going on that led up to it. And ask him about his feelings. Or supply them <br/>\nfor him, like &quot;You must have felt frustrated.&quot; Don&#39;t try to turn it into a <br/>\nlecture on what he should have done. The goal is self awareness so he can help <br/>\nhimself.<br/>\n<br/>\n (But of course stop him when he&#39;s playing rough! The baby needs to feel that <br/>\nhome is a safe place for him. You don&#39;t need to be angry. Just firm that <br/>\nhurting isn&#39;t allowed.)<br/>\n<br/>\n Learning how to identify feelings is probably like learning how to identify <br/>\nwine. Just as even the most wine-ignorant adults can tell a red wine from a <br/>\nwhite wine ;-) kids probably have the easy emotions figured out: happy, sad, <br/>\nmad. But the rest get lumped under one of those categories. They need help <br/>\nidentifying the nuances. We can help by labeling what they must be feeling. Or <br/>\nlabeling what a character on TV or in a book might be feeling in a situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n And talk about other things he could do when he has the feelings coming on. <br/>\nOffer them as help, not in a shaming way that says &quot;I can&#39;t believe you did <br/>\nthat instead of this.&quot; Above all make sure he knows being rough with the baby is <br/>\nnot okay. Even better is talking about what might happen in a particular <br/>\nsituation and helping him plan ahead on what he could do instead. Don&#39;t expect him <br/>\nto act as he planned. It&#39;s a learning process. Knowing that keeping the bike <br/>\nwheels moving makes the bike more stable isn&#39;t the same as being able to do <br/>\nit. It takes lots of practice before what you know in your head is right becomes <br/>\nsecond nature.<br/>\n<br/>\n (Sandra Dodd has said when her kids were little she said, &quot;You can hit each <br/>\nother only if first you talk about it, second you get a grown up to help you <br/>\nsettle it, and if that doesn&#39;t work, THEN you can hit.&quot; So when they hit each <br/>\nother, she&#39;d ask if they&#39;d talked about it, and if they&#39;d asked an adult to <br/>\nhelp. Not done in a shaming way, but a helpful way.)<br/>\n<br/>\n He will make mistakes. And when he makes mistakes you want him to feel free <br/>\nto come to you for help. If you&#39;ve made it clear that hurting the baby is not <br/>\nokay and he slips up, it&#39;s not because he missed the part about where hurting <br/>\nthe baby is not okay and needs reminded. It&#39;s because he needs help handling <br/>\nthe turmoil of feelings inside.<br/>\n<br/>\n Be there with them and aware as much as you can so you can start noticing <br/>\nthe symptoms and help redirect him. If he isn&#39;t yet capable of not hurting the <br/>\nbaby, then don&#39;t leave them alone together. Not as a punishment to say you <br/>\ndon&#39;t trust him, but because they both deserve to feel safe in their own home. If <br/>\nthere were a dog about to bite him, he&#39;d want to trust that you&#39;d be there to <br/>\nsnatch him up out of harm&#39;s way, not hover in the background and then yell at <br/>\nthe dog.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":237204573,"authorName":"Darlene Navarre","from":"Darlene Navarre &lt;dknbhn@...&gt;","profile":"dknbhn","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Active Listening Problem","postDate":"1130771037","msgId":23287,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUxMDMxMTUwMzU4LjQxNDQyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjM1NTEzLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":23285,"nextInTopic":23288,"prevInTime":23286,"nextInTime":23288,"topicId":23271,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you for this perspective and advise this really helped.

I so would appreciate any and all<br/>\nresponses. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s some stuff I do and did with Jayn now 6. The foundation of it is not<br/>\nto take her anger personally, while still acknowledging whatever my part<br/>\nmight have been in creating it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first part is not to place Jayn into a position where she is likely to<br/>\nmeltdown if that is remotely possible - also not to continue to thwart her<br/>\nto the point that she feels that frustrated, but to begin the process of<br/>\nfinding an alternative fulfillment at the beginning. For example if your<br/>\nchild always has a hard time in large, loud, echoey places - start shopping<br/>\nat a small local grocery instead. (That is partly how of we solved her<br/>\n&quot;store running&quot; problem btw)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Jayn is having any kind of meltdown, she responds best to physicality<br/>\nwith me, ahead of verbal reassurances or empathizing. The core of it is to<br/>\nask myself &quot;What loving action, as is showing my love to Jayn, can I take<br/>\nright now?&quot; That is the magic question, regardless of how obnoxious she is<br/>\nbeing. <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom a recent discussion on AU:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; What I came to realize is that the priority, in all cases of negative<br/>\nbehavior, must be to *show* her my continued love and acceptance of her as a<br/>\nperson *first*, and then if necessary express my desires or give the helpful<br/>\ninformation that she seems to be lacking. Often just the loving action<br/>\nchanges her emotional state and she stops the problem actions. This ties in<br/>\nwith assuming she is doing the best she can, and expressing empathy (see<br/>\nNaomi Aldort&#39;s writing) which is best done with Jayn, by a loving physical<br/>\naction. I know not all children want this physical response in times of<br/>\nintensity.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe additional bonus for me is that choosing these loving actions helps my<br/>\nanger (at whatever level) to melt away also - the immediate result is a<br/>\nmother who is thinking clearly and logically so able to make better<br/>\ndecisions.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes that is holding out my arms to her, sometimes it is blowing a<br/>\nraspberry on her belly, sometimes it is giving her my hands to push against,<br/>\nsometimes it is restraining her for the purpose of letting her push against<br/>\nmy body. These are all strategies that help her become emotionally organized<br/>\nagain.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a situation of that idea working to avoid a meltdown in a public<br/>\nplace recently:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Or perhaps we are in a situation of immediate conflicting needs as we<br/>\nwere this &quot;morning&quot; while getting our breakfast (everyone else&#39;s dinner) at<br/>\nHome Town Buffet. Jayn was finished and wanted to leave at once. Dh and I<br/>\nsaid that we wanted to finish our desserts first. Jayn started to say &quot;no I<br/>\nwant to go NOW&quot; and getting louder and teary. Huge crowd in the place, btw.<br/>\n<br/>\nI made a conscious decision, despite a certain amount of internal rising<br/>\nstress, to show her some love and acceptance *first*, despite what<br/>\nconventional parenting might label &quot;whining&quot; or &quot;rewarding of negative<br/>\nbehavior&quot;. I drew her on to my lap, gave her a slow hug and a kiss, and then<br/>\ntold her that I knew she wanted to go and being patient is hard, but we<br/>\nneeded a few minutes to finish our desserts. I felt her physically relax.<br/>\nThen she sniffled a bit, but sat quietly and gently on her chair and waited<br/>\nfor the few minutes, conversing about other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past when something like this has occurred, we have tried just the<br/>\nverbal empathy and reasoning, Jayn continued to loudly complain, and then<br/>\ndh, with some grumpiness, has taken Jayn to the car to wait rather than<br/>\ndisturb other diners. This is usually somewhat OK because he generally has<br/>\nalready finished fast and also dislikes waiting, and I am the slow eater<br/>\n(often because I have spent time assisting Jayn with the buffet instead of<br/>\neating). For some reason today we were both still munching.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is that what I did today felt so much better, so right, *and*<br/>\nworked - by which I mean Jayn willingly chose Patience.&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps me to have a mental script. It helps me even more if the mental<br/>\nscript is something that I devised for myself, fully authentic to me and the<br/>\nway I think and speak and with my priorities, as against just following the<br/>\nscripts of other parenting writers. Having a deliberate script (it might be<br/>\nsomething as simple as &quot;Breathe&quot;) for *myself* has been the best way to<br/>\navoid knee jerk reactions.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s something I wrote fairly recently that is kinda related. It has to do<br/>\nwith focusing on discovering the unexpressed need, rather than necessarily<br/>\nwanting to stop the meltdown or negative behavior such as hitting me:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt; I have found from my experience that the parent(me) thinking, &quot;I have to<br/>\n*correct* this bad action with information&quot; (or even &quot;I need her to know how<br/>\nI am feeling&quot;) is a distancing thought. It is not that I never enacted that<br/>\nkind of reaction to Jayn. But I found that it was a path that led to<br/>\nfrustration for both of us - and tended to backfire with Jayn so that I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t even get to the next step. In re-examining my past uses of the<br/>\n&quot;that hurts me&quot; phrases, I believe I was speaking in a way I had been told I<br/>\n&quot;should&quot; do, and that there was a didactic paradigm, or a controlling<br/>\nparadigm behind it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever I found a better-for-us procedure. Instead of focusing first on the<br/>\nnegative, I try consciously choosing to think the phrase &quot;What does she<br/>\nneed?&quot;, or more recently what I have found far and away the most helpful<br/>\nthought &quot;What loving action can I take towards Jayn *right now*?&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis has produced the results that I would hope for - Jayn becoming calmer,<br/>\nmore able to verbalize, more empathetic to me and, incidentally, likely to<br/>\napologize for hurting me.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess that underlying these strategies is the concept that a young child<br/>\nis probably not ready to verbalize coherently in the heat of a meltdown - so<br/>\nthe &quot;active&quot; portion of Active Listening, needs to come to the forefront.<br/>\n(g).<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally here is Tree Goddess&#39;s fabulous list of helpful (active and<br/>\nphysical) strategies for restoring calm and serenity:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Calming Activities:  Experiences that may help to relax the nervous system<br/>\n<br/>\n* Stretches<br/>\n* Deep pressure massage<br/>\n* Slow rocking or swinging<br/>\n* Fidget toys<br/>\n* Progressive muscle relaxation<br/>\n* Quite music with a steady beat<br/>\n* Bear hugs<br/>\n* Reduced noise and light levels<br/>\n* Lavender, vanilla or other soothing smells<br/>\n* Snuggling in a sleeping bag, large pillows or bean bag chair<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Organizing Activities: Experiences that can help an individual become<br/>\nfocused and attentive<br/>\n<br/>\n*Sucking or chewing on hard candy or gum<br/>\n* Adding rhythm to the activity<br/>\n* Vibration-toy massager, vibrating pillow, wiggle pen<br/>\n* Heavy work tasks to include hanging, pushing, pulling or carrying heavy<br/>\nobjects<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly: To organize<br/>\n*Swinging on a swing or climbing<br/>\n* Rhythmical sustained movement:  marching, washing a table, or bouncing<br/>\n* Rocking in a rocking chair<br/>\n* &quot;Squeezie&quot; toys (koosh balls, balloons or rubber gloves filled with flour<br/>\nor cream, soft balls, gak, silly putty)<br/>\n* Hanging by the arms on the monkey bars (20-30 seconds)<br/>\n* Pushing/carrying heavy objects<br/>\n* Carrying back packs weighted with books or bags of dried beans (this<br/>\nshould only be worn for 15-20 minutes with an hour or two between) *A<br/>\nreading corner with a bean bag chair makes a wonderful place for escape when<br/>\nthere is too much stimulation.  Some children may like the bean bag on top<br/>\nof them.<br/>\n* Play dough<br/>\n* Tactile Bins (cornmeal, oatmeal, water, sand, rice, beans)<br/>\n* Kitchen time (mixing, tasting, smelling, washing up)<br/>\n* Finger painting<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSome children also need extra sensory input in their mouths and hands in<br/>\norder to organize their behavior:<br/>\n<br/>\n* Drinking from a water bottle<br/>\n* Chewing (you can use a straw, rubber tubing or coffee stir stick)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To calm:<br/>\n<br/>\n* Being brushed with a corn de-silking brush (in one direction approximately<br/>\n10 times with pressure brush their arms, back (but not over the spine), legs<br/>\n(on the top, outer parts and underneath, avoid the inner thigh area),  top<br/>\nof the feet and the hands)<br/>\n<br/>\n* Sucking on hard candy, frozen fruit bar, or spoonful of peanut butter or<br/>\nmarshmallow fluff<br/>\n* Licorice tug-of-war, blow pin wheels or various types of blow toys,<br/>\nbubbles and whistles<br/>\n* Pushing against walls with the hands, shoulders, back, buttocks and head<br/>\n* Cuddling or back rubbing<br/>\n* Taking a bath<br/>\n* Being rolled tightly like a hot dog in a blanket<br/>\n* Being squished under a therapy ball, mat or couch cushion<br/>\n* Tug-of-war<br/>\n* Wheelbarrow walking, jumping games like hop scotch<br/>\n* Crashing games-run and dive into boxes, bean bags and couch cushions<br/>\n* Pulling a wagon, carrying a heavy book bag, digging in the yard or<br/>\ncarrying groceries<br/>\n* Sports such as wrestling and football<br/>\n* Deep pressure (giving a massage) and joint compressions (holding above one<br/>\njoint and under one joint then doing a quick 10 repetitions of compressions,<br/>\npushing and pulling)<br/>\n* A mini trampoline<br/>\n* A sockem bopper or whatever they call those weighted kid-sized things that<br/>\nspring back up after you knock them down<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Robyn L.

He would even follow us around trying to make us commit to a plan.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat has worked for us is to tell him what the general plan is (yes, we will plan to ask his friend over later in the day) but to say loudly and firmly (yes, that is the plan but things might change, we might have a flat coming home from the store, or somebody might get sick....we are hoping to ask his friend over but it might change).<br/>\n<br/>\nThen when it does hit the fan and we have to change a plan, Zach starts into the &quot;but you said&quot; and I remind him that it wasn&#39;t written in stone, that things change, that yes that was the plan and perhaps we can do it tomorrow, but it isn&#39;t happening today.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter many years, it is improving.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Darlene Navarre &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dknbhn@...\">dknbhn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Friday, October 28, 2005 11:41 pm<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Active Listening Problem<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am working on &quot;active Listening&quot; with my children.
