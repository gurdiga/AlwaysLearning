And I didn&#39;t feel badly about being judged by people who obviously weren&#39;t thinking well. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son never sucked a binkie or his thumb and still wore braces.   He had hypodontia, genetic missing permanent teeth.   There is no precaution we might have taken against tooth problems that could have helped him except, maybe, not having him at all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would not sacrifice my child&#39;s comfort today in the hope of warding off some possible future evil.

It helped him sleep, it helped him relax, it helped zone out. We were <br/>\nin Japan and I couldn&#39;t find new ones that were not for infants. And the ones he <br/>\nhad were getting gross and I was embarrassed. Gosh, it seems so minor and I feel <br/>\nso bad about making a big deal out of something that means nothing now that he&#39;s <br/>\n13. But I started to cut these gross and well used pacifiers so that he would <br/>\nwean off them. Or they would be too small to suck. He didn&#39;t have options, he <br/>\nhad to give them up. He sucked his shirts, he sucked his thumb, he sucked <br/>\nanything. He was a sucker. I apologised to him a couple of weeks ago for messing <br/>\nwith his pacifier, for not asking my mom to go to Toys R Us and buy a bunch and <br/>\nsend them to him, for not letting him have what he wanted. He told me he thinks <br/>\nhe&#39;s turned out alright anyhow ;). But I still feel for 3 year old Simon. <br/>\n<br/>\nOver at Familyrunn.ing.com Meredith made a comment that included this: &quot;The <br/>\nolder my kids get, the more I look back and think &quot;what was the big deal?&quot; <br/>\nThere&#39;s soooooo much cultural pressure on parents to guide and mold and most of <br/>\nall do/tell/teach Now! Before it&#39;s Too Late! It can help to be aware of that <br/>\npressure and question it strongly. When people are ready to learn things, <br/>\nlearning flows. I&#39;m tempted to say it flows effortlessly, even though it can <br/>\ntake a fantastic effort to accomplish one&#39;s goals.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere wasn&#39;t any reason for me stopping Simon from using his pacifier. Nothing. <br/>\nThe teeth fear is a future fear. What will happen if her teeth are crooked? What <br/>\nwill happen if she&#39;s happy and smiley and the world sees that she has less than <br/>\nperfect teeth? Really, what will happen? I have less than perfect teeth, (more <br/>\nthan perfect teeth?) and so far it hasn&#39;t adversely affected my life. The worry <br/>\nabout how others would think of you is a more normal one, but when you really <br/>\nlook at it, well, it isn&#39;t nearly as important as loving your child with or <br/>\nwithout a pacifier. It&#39;s a small part of a life. My dad had a blanket that he <br/>\nworried with his fingers. It had a satin trim and he would rub it between his <br/>\nfingers until he wore it away. His mom would put new satin trim on it, each time <br/>\nthe blanket was smaller. I think he wore it right down. But it was a good memory <br/>\nfor him.And it was a sweet thing that his mom did for him. I had a boyfriend who <br/>\nsucked his thumb at 24. It didn&#39;t make him less attractive, he didn&#39;t do it at <br/>\nparties or around most people, but when he slept or when he was quiet and calm <br/>\nhe would suck his thumb and rub his nose. It&#39;s what he did. It didn&#39;t handicap <br/>\nhim in any way that I could tell. Your daughter likes her pacifier, her binkie. <br/>\nAnd while you make think 4 almost 5 is too old for such a thing, 4 almost 5 is <br/>\nvery little. If people comment try to think of things like, oh, I wish I had <br/>\nsuch an easy way to feel better, chuckle, or well, it was that or cigarettes. It <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t matter. What they think of her that moment won&#39;t tell them what to think <br/>\nabout her in a different moment. What they think about you, well, that&#39;s less <br/>\nimportant probably.

That said, my best friend also sucked her thumb until late adolescence and has great teeth. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn spite of all the braces and adults trying to forcibly remove my thumb from my mouth and asking me what it tasted of (it tastes like me - what a question!), I got so much comfort from my thumb. In hindsight I could have done without the orthodontic treatments but I still don&#39;t think if I&#39;d known then what I know now I would have given up my thumb. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess that answers my question about my son&#39;s binkie.

My grandmother used to let me have it even though my mom was trying to keep it away from me.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI would think it is kinder to your child and more beneficial to your relationship to trust that if your child wants this to suck on (for whatever reason she has...comfort, likes it, etc) that she will stop using it when she doesn&#39;t want or need it.  The emotional upsetness of having it taken away and the power struggles that might occur about it are not worth it.  Also, she may think about what else that is so important to her might be taken away.  Others have already posted that it doesn&#39;t always affect teeth.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThink on this awhile.  There is no harm in waiting a little more to think about it.  Notice how much your daughter enjoys it.  (Is it really worth trying to take something away that isn&#39;t proven to be harmful and brings some kind of satisfaction to her?  And even if an orthodontist or dentist thought she might want to consider orthodontics at some future point, would it have been worth it?  I don&#39;t know the answer to that question, but it is something to consider.  Pros and cons.).  Notice what times she wants it - is it when she is sleepy?  Can you introduce a new &quot;thing&quot; that she can get some kind of comfort or satisfaction or connection with that might slowly be liked just as much (and then maybe she wouldn&#39;t eventually even want it)?  For example - backrubs, a special movie, hugging a new soft stuffed animal, drinking a cup of chamomile tea and honey while in your arms with a soft blanket around you as you rock on a comfy chair, etc.  If you are sure you still want to try to get rid of it, see if you can incorporate something just as comforting and/or satisfying instead.  I don&#39;t know if that would work, but it might be worth a try rather than suddenly taking it away.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaurie (who still remembers climbing up on the counter at age 4 to get my binkie!)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":221105640,"authorName":"Priscilla Sanstead","from":"Priscilla Sanstead &lt;bobcatpris2000@...&gt;","profile":"bobcatpris2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] My 4 Year Old Still Has A Binkie....","postDate":"1291493201","msgId":58338,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI5Njg0MC4yODE3Mi5xbUB3ZWIzMjQwMy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":58337,"nextInTopic":58340,"prevInTime":58337,"nextInTime":58339,"topicId":58325,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My daughter had a binkie until about age 3, but was a thumb sucker until age 14 or 15.

The hospital nurses had called it &quot;self-comforting behavior&quot;. Most everyone we knew wanted me to stop it as she got older, and said that peer pressure would definitely stop it in the first grade. It did not. She didn&#39;t care what other people thought about it, and neither did I. (Sometimes she would hide it behind a book or her blankie, though. Yes, she carried a blankie everywhere for years, to the chagrin of many.) Her teeth are perfectly straight at age 17. She had a slight gap in front for a few years, but it closed on its own.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seemed to me that if my child&#39;s self-comforting behavior was stifled, another behavior that other adults would find even more irritating would show up in its place. And then she and I would hear complaints about THAT behavior. Three moms I knew then told told me privately that either they or their teenage girls had sucked THEIR thumbs until age 16, and their teeth ended up perfectly straight. They had to tell me PRIVATELY? Yes, because there is such a stigma to the thumb.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the thumb issue is just another example of adults wanting to control the behaviors of children, regardless of what might be respectful or considerate for the child.<br/>\n<br/>\nPriscilla<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      My sister was a thumb sucker until almost 8 or 9 and she has perfect teeth.
