Once I let go of worrying about whether or not my children were learning the academic subjects that are taught in school and let go of worrying about whether they were on track with their schooled friends, so many frustrations started to float away. There&#39;s no frustration from trying to get a child to just sit down and do his work. I went through a lot of that with my oldest when he was in school and when we first started homeschooling and tried to follow a curriculum. It was miserable for everyone. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow we just live life with the awareness that learning happens all the time in the individual&#39;s own time. There are life frustrations but they are caused by real situations that we need to learn how to negotiate for life.
