Wish I could win a trip to America to <br/>\nmeet you all - and to meet up with a couple of old friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m afraid that it is far less common to put money out for milk these <br/>\ndays. Most people buy tokens and use those instead, as these are far <br/>\nless attractive to the young kids who found it a good money making <br/>\nracket!  I missed our local street parade this year at New Year, as we <br/>\nwere out of town. (Well, we don&#39;t actually live in town, but you know <br/>\nwhat I mean!) In the bigger cities they have the expensive floats and <br/>\nfancy effects, but we country folk stick to the simple still &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you dh has a great trip and manages to get himself sorted out - <br/>\neven if I do think a three month trip to NZ with a stop over in Aussie <br/>\nwould be a better bet &lt;beg&gt; It will be hard for you being left behind - <br/>\nthank goodness for e-mail and phones, huh?<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77859720,"authorName":"Susan Bundlie","from":"Susan Bundlie &lt;strandbe@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Dh&#39;s Big Adventure","postDate":"1010505553","msgId":2306,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI4NjA3MzcwLjZBMyVzdHJhbmRiZUBtZWRpYW9uZS5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMTAzMzU2NTYuNDIzMy4yOTA1My5tNkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":2313,"prevInTime":2305,"nextInTime":2307,"topicId":2306,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-467546409\">&lt;&lt;We also have 11 acres of bush and a stream and a waterfall, and are only<br/>\n10 minutes drive from the best surf spot in New Zealand and I wouldn&#39;t live<br/>\nanywhere else ever again!&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMany years ago my husband dragged me out to the airport because a new<br/>\nairline was having a drawing with a free trip to New Zealand as the grand<br/>\nprize. We had to dress in costume, which I was not in the mood to do--I<br/>\nthink we put on a couple of tropical shirts and some kind of hat.  The<br/>\n³catch² was that the winner had to be prepared to leave in a few days and<br/>\nthere would be no layovers.<br/>\n<br/>\nLo and behold, I won! Because of a strike of some kind we were able to delay<br/>\nthe trip long enough to get everything in order, and then we were off to<br/>\nparts unknown with our 22-month-old in tow.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe absolutely adored New Zealand and many times over the years have even<br/>\ntalked about emigrating. The people were wonderful, the land was gorgeous<br/>\nand everything just seemed sweet and gentle. So many times since I have told<br/>\nthe story of leaving money outside overnight in a wooden box *in the open*<br/>\nand finding it replaced with milk in the morning.   I wonder if that¹s still<br/>\npossible.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also saw the best parade EVER in New Zealand. It was in a smallish town<br/>\nand there were many, many ³floats² all done with love by hand. No fancy,<br/>\nhigh-tech lights or expensive effects--just lots of families dressed up,<br/>\nsinging and dancing. Wonderful.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dh may have a chance to be there again soon. He¹s quitting his job<br/>\n(sh-h-h-h-h--they don¹t know quite yet) and taking a three-month trip by<br/>\nhimself to Australia with a possible stop-over in NZ. After years and years<br/>\nof working at a job he¹s always been very stressed-out about, this is his<br/>\nchance (³children² are 19 and almost-22) to unwind, ³find himself² and try<br/>\nto plan the future. I can¹t go with him, and I don¹t even think I would if I<br/>\ncould--it¹s something he needs to do alone.  I¹m so happy for him while at<br/>\nthe same time so SAD at the thought of not being with him (this will be our<br/>\nfirst long separation in 37 years!).<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2311,"nextTopicId":2084}}
