She got her GED within a year. She worked at a local retail store, a hobby shop, and pursued her own interests at the time. When She was 16 she followed my DH (then my BF) and I to WA state where we were going to college. She got a great job in a local, organic bakery that most of the college students would&#39;ve killed for...but she got the job, and they didn&#39;t. When she was 18 she started taking courses at the local community college. She transferred her credits to The Evergreen State College when she was 19, and had already qualified to be an in-state resident, thus lower tuition. At 22 she got her BS from Evergreen, and then went to work in China as an English teacher for 2 years. At 26 she applied to and got accepted at Bastyr University of Naturopathy. Now, she is 35, happily married, a Doctor of Naturopathy, and running a healthy and vibrant practice in Seattle.  She is one of my greatest inspirations and a perfect example of how kids don&#39;t need school to succeed and do what they want to do.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Another concern","postDate":"1267572640","msgId":51304,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZERjY4MjlFLTRDQUMtNDZGMy1CNzU0LTRGODY4MDVCOEY0NEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDk5NDAyNS44MTc5MS5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDIubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhtamMwdStub2JvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8OTk0MDI1LjgxNzkxLnFtQHdlYjExMDQwMi5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":51300,"nextInTopic":51321,"prevInTime":51303,"nextInTime":51305,"topicId":51254,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I think more and more kids are doing this actually!

Even without a GED, taking placement tests and then moving on to college courses.  I met a girl at the bookstore the other day and for some reason she felt very chatty with me and was telling me all about her experience of having just dropped out of high school, taking her GED and starting a few courses in the local community college.  She took her GED the moment she turned 16, which is the youngest you can take it where I live, that was last Nov. and now she&#39;s taking college courses and really enjoying them.  She said the kind of information that she was getting from her college classes was actually meaningful and interesting, where as her experience of high school was one of sheer boredom.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe also said that the GED was pretty easy and that the practice test was actually harder and more stressful than the real test.  She also stated that she was finding that most of the people that she&#39;s meeting that have diplomas probably couldn&#39;t pass the GED.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething else to think about, is that sometimes 13 yr olds change their minds by the time they are 16, or &quot;college&quot; age.  While I&#39;m sure there are some 13 yr olds that are concerned about what they will do in the future, that hasn&#39;t really been the case with my daughter.  She lives very much in the now, learning as she goes along doing meaningful things relevant to her life.  I don&#39;t see that changing and if going to college will add, in a meaningful way that is relevant to her life, then she&#39;ll probably go.
