I did agree that it could be <br/>\nnegotiable after she asked what if what she wanted was 50c more.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, when we arrived, she immediately wanted a giant pony, but it was <br/>\nmore than the amount we&#39;d agreed, so she moved on, and found a unicorn <br/>\nhobbyhorse which was the amount we&#39;d agreed on, so she wanted it.  Instead <br/>\nof commenting, I helped her pick out one that worked (the played sounds), <br/>\nand she gallopped around the store while we helped my sister pick out <br/>\nslides.  Then she decided she didn&#39;t want the unicorn anymore, so we walked <br/>\nback to take it back.  Next she found a big box of plastic toy food which <br/>\nwas just over what we&#39;d agreed on.  She carried it around for a while too, <br/>\nand I said nothing, even though I was hoping she wouldn&#39;t choose it.  (My <br/>\nopinon on how much use she&#39;d get out of it, which wasn&#39;t necessarily right). <br/>\nShe then settled on a plastic toy cake with velcro decorations, which I <br/>\nactually thought was pretty cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe did get a little upset a couple of times saying she didn&#39;t know what to <br/>\nchoose, but with plenty of time and patience, she was able to make a really <br/>\ngood choice, and get something she&#39;s played with a lot since she got home.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that perhaps a lot of the problems we&#39;ve been having with her <br/>\ngetting home and wishing she&#39;d bought something else is a combination of not <br/>\ngiving her enough time to make a choice, and putting too much of our own <br/>\nevaluation on what she is buying, even if we&#39;re trying not to.

A bunch of what she got were bouncy balls, we had lots of bouncy  <br/>\nballs<br/>\nfor a long time, but they&#39;ve all proven valuable as cat and dog toys  <br/>\nover the<br/>\nyears. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly did coin machines and bouncy balls.  She had an old jewelry box  <br/>\n(one of the fancy-paper-covered cardboard ones made to look nicer than  <br/>\nits materials) and the nicest bouncy balls were sorted into the  <br/>\ndrawers that might have held rings and bracelets.  The plainer ones  <br/>\nwent in the bottom.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce we rented a helium tank and got some nice balloons, for a party  <br/>\nhere.  Holly had the idea of putting bouncy balls inside balloons, pre- <br/>\nhelium.  Then helium.  It would work with air, too, but that was HOURS  <br/>\nof fun.  Serious fun.  You can hold the balloon and get the super ball  <br/>\nspinning around inside it and then throw it.  It moves really  <br/>\nerratically.  If it&#39;s helium, it moves around, and maybe up, very  <br/>\nerratically.  Or they would get the ball bouncing up, and when it was  <br/>\nat the apex, let go.  The balloon started up, then the ball&#39;s bump on  <br/>\nthe way down disturbed it, but it would still go up.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes people have said, &quot;Well I don&#39;t get ideas like that.&quot;  I  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t either.  It took years for that idea to come to pass.  It took  <br/>\nyears of me letting Holly collect little super balls (and helping her,  <br/>\nby not throwing them away if I found them, and making sure she had a  <br/>\ngood place to keep them).  It took being willing to see that a day of  <br/>\nhelium balloon play could be worth the $50 or whatever it cost us.  It  <br/>\ntook Holly having had people say &quot;Let&#39;s try it!&quot; or &quot;Sure, okay&quot; for  <br/>\nyears, rather than &quot;That&#39;s stupid,&quot; and &quot;Don&#39;t,&quot; and &quot;What are you  <br/>\nDOING!?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou need to start early with being sweet, generous, accepting, and  <br/>\ngaining faith in learning itself and in the potential of your  <br/>\nchildren&#39;s response to living in a rich and peaceful environment.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-They don&#39;t want the most expensive, they don&#39;t want the most  <br/>\nimpressive. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday I heard Holly say to Marty and Ashlee (Marty&#39;s girlfriend)  <br/>\nthat she would like to go with them, to lunch with their friend Ben.   <br/>\nShe had overheard that they were going, and wanted an invitation.    <br/>\nThey said okay very nicely, and they all left.  I was picturing one of  <br/>\nthe several nice restaurants they know and like.   While they were  <br/>\nstill gone, Holly tweeted this:<br/>\n<br/>\nTaco Bell lunch with some of my favorite people. And mmmm Taco  <br/>\nBellllll. about 19 hours ago<br/>\n<br/>\nFor anyone living where Taco Bell is an unknown, it&#39;s a very  <br/>\ninexpensive taco and burrito chain that&#39;s been around since the  <br/>\n1960&#39;s, mostly a drive-through, with small dining rooms that could be  <br/>\nhosed down, they&#39;re so solidly plastic and metal.  About the only  <br/>\ndecorations are the logo and the paper bags.  It&#39;s probably the least  <br/>\nexpensive place in town, but Holly was as happy as could be.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh!

One thing I think that has helped some is that I very seldom buy things for myself that I have to planned.  A few weeks ago I picked up a purse at target on clearance without planning to buy a purse but i dont dont do that often. My husband and I research and debate alot of purchases. When we go to the store therefore, whether it is for something for any of us we usually do it with a purpose.  Even if that purpose is to find something to buy with their christmas money.  Often my two youngest dont really have anything in mind, but my two older ones typically have things they want in mind.  And I try to warn them ahead of time if it isnt going to be possible this trip.  For example they really want a new video game that just came out but it is still 50 dollars.  We dont have the money, so I rented it for them this week for 6.  <br/>\nIf they really want to buy something though, money is burning a hole in their pocket or something, i take them to the dollar store or a garage sale.  I will say though that time has helped.  My 8 year old was interested in entering a tournament for taekwondo the other day. I said if he really wanted to I would sign him up.  He asked how much it was.  When I told him he responded, &quot;you know I really want a GOOD skateboard for my birthday, so I think I would rather you keep that money so you have enough to get a nice one.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":216914372,"authorName":"riasplace3","from":"&quot;riasplace3&quot; &lt;riasplace3@...&gt;","profile":"riasplace3","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Money and spending?","postDate":"1278767801","msgId":55811,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGkxOXJycCtwazFpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDExNzk5LjQ2NDk4LnFtQHdlYjg2MjA0Lm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":55794,"nextInTopic":55896,"prevInTime":55810,"nextInTime":55812,"topicId":55658,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"One of the things which helped me say yes to spending more was to collect quarters for machines.

She would ask for 20 pence <br/>\npieces for much of the time we were there, which got frustating, largely because <br/>\nit was repeated over and over again.

A bunch of what she got were bouncy balls, we had lots of bouncy balls <br/>\nfor a long time, but they&#39;ve all proven valuable as cat and dog toys over the <br/>\nyears. I can remember being annoyed at the money being spent on occassion, but <br/>\nwhat has been amazing has been the pleasure those 20 pence balls have added as <br/>\nwell as the real sense of richness that Linnaea has. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers have pointed this out about their own children, but neither Linnaea nor <br/>\nSimon are needy. Linnaea, particularly, but Simon in lesser ways, went through <br/>\nperiods of huge desire for things from stores. And it was easy to feel <br/>\nfrustrated, to feel poorer at the prospect of their need. David was very good at <br/>\nbeing generous when I was tired or grumpy. I can remember once in Singapore <br/>\nairport when he happily took Linnaea to buy a pair of lovely silk pajamas when I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t face spending any more money. I&#39;m so glad he did. She really loved <br/>\nthose pajamas. But both of them now will turn things down more often than they <br/>\nwill accept them. I try, I offer and I ply them with things, but they don&#39;t want <br/>\nwhat they don&#39;t want. It took a real sense of abudance for them to get to a <br/>\npoint of being so discerning. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was a child, and into being an adult, I looked to things to fulfill me. I <br/>\nwas a marketer&#39;s dream. I figured if I looked right or if I had the right toys <br/>\nor the right something I could be attractive enough or good enough or sucessful <br/>\nenough or happy enough to do whatever it was that I felt needed to be done or <br/>\nwhatever it was. It is amazing to not see that in Simon and Linnaea. They like <br/>\nwhat they like and they get what they want and then they are done with getting <br/>\nstuff. They don&#39;t want the most expensive, they don&#39;t want the most impressive. <br/>\nHeck, even the things they do want, like Xbox games or whatever, they will wait <br/>\nfor the price to go down or they will really research to make sure it is what <br/>\nthey want. I am so very impressed by them. And the only things that I can see <br/>\nthat made that difference was the freedom to buy things, the abundance that they <br/>\nhad and the support and love that David and I have given them. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: kristi_beguin &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:foehn_jye@...\">foehn_jye@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Friday, 9 July, 2010 23:15:09<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Money and spending?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Here&#39;s a way to see such a situation, buying a brush.

When she went to the store with her Dad, did she have enough time to really experience the shopping? If they went with the intended purpose of getting the craft kit, and she got swayed by something else, maybe she didn&#39;t have enough time in the store to really figure out what she wanted to buy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy girls LOVE to go shoe shopping. We go to Target, or Payless, or Kohls and they try on every shoe they want. We pull everything out they are interested in, try them on, walk around in them, look in the mirrors, and in the end they each decide after they&#39;ve had lots of time to figure it out, and they are generally so in love with their new shoes after that and so happily strut about showing them off to their friends and family for weeks afterward. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Quite frequently, if I ask her what it actually is that she&#39;s wanting (as in, what is in that box on the shelf), she has no idea, but she&#39;s going to scream until she gets it anyway.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is this during regular grocery store type trips?

I say, we will, because we are going to the store to buy a whole lot of things. And many of those things will be just for the kids--certain foods, snacks, etc. This is where choices and involving them in the shopping process has really helped, they are helping to stock our shelves, and choosing things they like to eat and use. I have found that if I have to rush into the store to get a couple things, my DD&#39;s desire to buy something is heightened--almost as if my lack of time increases her need to buy exponentially.  In those times, I choose our route accordingly--avoiding the toy aisle, and then being sure to ask if she would like some nail polish, gum, or candy as we check out. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the issue is about her feeling the lack of money, and possibly needing to buy something before it runs out, I second the dollar store idea...dollar stores, thrift stores, good will, garage sales, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause we live about an hour away from the quality &quot;stuff&quot; stores (Target, Kohls, etc.) another thing that often helps both my girls when we are at home and they are needing to buy and shop is to look on the computer  or in the kid catalogues that come in the mail...they circle the pics in the catalogue and they come up with ideas when browsing through clothes and toys on the computer...it&#39;s another means for them to enjoy the experience of shopping.

Like I said, that doesn&#39;t work with every child, and it certainly doesn&#39;t work without a lot of compassion for and attention to the needs and desires of the child in the moment. Its not some kind of trick, its a way of saying &quot;yes&quot; that fills a need for some kids (or adults for that matter, like reading an article while waiting in line means you don&#39;t have any need to buy the magazine). <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Then about an hour or so after getting <br/>\n&gt; home and playing with the toy, she wished she had bought the other toy, and <br/>\n&gt; wanted to go straight back and buy it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It sucks to realize that you wish you&#39;d gotten the other thing. I&#39;ve been there more times than I can count! Be compassionate. Depending on the cost and the duration of the trip, is it feasible to go out and get the other thing? If not, put it on a wish list or vision board, treat the matter as seriously as if you&#39;d bought a bra that didn&#39;t end up being as comfortable an hour after wearing it as it seemed in the changing room. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m at a loss as to how I can handle this in an unschooling manner, <br/>\n&gt; especially given our limited finances at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Finances are sometimes a very real limit. It can help to have a budget - with Mo it used to help, if we were going to more than one store in a trip, to have a budget for each store since I knew she&#39;d want to get something everywhere we stopped. So I&#39;d do a little thinking ahead of time, think about the prices of things in each store, and set an amount based on that. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen our finances have been dire, we didn&#39;t take Mo to stores. George and I would arrange our scedules so that one of us could go without her. I did take her to yard sales, library sales, auctions and thrift shops so that *she* could shop, but not retail stores. I set it up so that I could say Yes. I even did things like visited banks for the free lollipops and balloons so that she could get something when we were all feeling the pinch of finances really hard. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Everything she sees, she wants and <br/>\n&gt; insists she is going to be miserable if she doesn&#39;t get it. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In the moment, commiserate. Let her know her feelings are important to you. Outside the moment, it can help to talk about what you do and how you feel when you can&#39;t have some lovely thing you want. What are your strategies? <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are occasions when, right before going in to a store, I&#39;ll let Mo know &quot;I only have money for this one thing (milk, for example) so please don&#39;t ask for anything else.&quot; She&#39;s understanding about those few times, and doesn&#39;t ask.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":160276266,"authorName":"Amanda&#39;s Shoebox","from":"&quot;Amanda&#39;s Shoebox&quot; &lt;amandasshoebox@...&gt;","profile":"amandasshoebox","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Money and spending?","postDate":"1278687379","msgId":55765,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGkxN2RhaitsdHBzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDRURCODEyN0JGMTRFRDBBRjEzOUFBMERGRDIyOTMyQFRhbWFyYT4="},"prevInTopic":55759,"nextInTopic":55766,"prevInTime":55764,"nextInTime":55766,"topicId":55658,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I like the idea of taking her to dollar stores and thrift stores.

I know he can feel less than abundant***<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea of living in abundance vs. scarcity is a big one in unschooling.  It is both tangible and non-tangible.  There will always be someone that appears to have more than you.  More time, more house, more activities, more money, more traveling, just more more more.  It will help to stop comparing yourself to others.  Looking for the abundance of your own life will help enormously.  What do you have in abundance?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat will be different for every person, every family.  We have an abundance of computers at our house.  We have an abundance of time, and remember time is priceless, how much time is one person&#39;s time worth?  How much time is a mother&#39;s time worth?  If you went out and got a job right now, how much would you get paid for your time, how much would it cost your family for you to get paid for your time?  Now go, do something with your kids, something sweet and abundant, milk and cookies and a movie, even, and decide what that time was worth.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbundance is in the eye of the beholder, as is scarcity.  It seems, and this is my experience, you can choose one or the other, regardless of physical possessions and monetarily defined activities.  Your whole physical being as a mom can be one of giving abundance to your kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s really hard for a young child to go to the store without feeling scarcity, don&#39;t take him.  Bring him home something small and special, even if it&#39;s a box of tic tacs from the checkout stand.  Those little things, those little extras that are so inexpensive, add up to a feeling of being loved and thought of and feeling abundant.  Thrift stores are great for feeling abundant with physical things.  Underneath the physical though, a feeling of abundance comes from feeling emotionally full.  Nobody can buy that feeling.  A parent can help create that feeling by giving of him or herself to a child that is feeling lack.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLook around your house, your neighborhood, what can you give to your child right now that will add to his feeling of abundance?  Paper airplanes?  A bike ride?  A bucket of ice?  A platter of interesting food?  A cozy place to sit?  An unusual game found online?  A made up game of cards?  A pocket knife and pieces of wood?  The ideas are limitless and they exist IN ABUNDANCE, but only if you choose to see it.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":361639019,"authorName":"joanne.lopers","from":"&quot;joanne.lopers&quot; &lt;wilmalv@...&gt;","profile":"joanne.lopers","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Crisis and More","postDate":"1278343255","msgId":55658,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGkwc3Q4bitqdTVlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":55659,"prevInTime":55657,"nextInTime":55659,"topicId":55658,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank-you for all the clarity.
