He&#39;s played with gears alot at the children&#39;s museum.<br/>\nHe likes them, but doesn&#39;t like that they slide away from each other<br/>\n(they&#39;re magnetized), so he can only turn them a few times before<br/>\nthey&#39;ll stop working. He doesn&#39;t want to have to fix them again and<br/>\nagain. This is part of the problem I run into, that he has an idea in<br/>\nhis head of how they should work, and when they don&#39;t work that way, he<br/>\ngets very frustrated and doesn&#39;t want to play with them anymore. We&#39;ve<br/>\ntalked about how inventors try things sometimes hundreds of times before<br/>\nthey get it to work, and I can see that his patience expands as he gets<br/>\nolder.<br/>\nToday he spent about 15 minutes weaving our computer charging cord<br/>\nthrough some angled tubes that are part of a build-your-own-saxophone.<br/>\nIt was the perfect activity for him, it didn&#39;t have a goal, he didn&#39;t<br/>\nhave a picture in his mind of how it should work, he fiddled with it for<br/>\nawhile and seemed quite happy with how it turned out. Maybe I just need<br/>\nto go to Home Depot and buy some pieces of things that fit together, and<br/>\nsee what happens?<br/>\nI looked at Mouse Trap, and might get that. He would definitely enjoy<br/>\nwatching the machine (Club Penguin has a similar machine in the secret<br/>\nagent headquarters, if anyone plays that), I think he&#39;d probably want me<br/>\nto set it up, which is fine. I loved that game as a child.<br/>\nTrisha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, John and Amanda Slater<br/>\n&lt;fourslaterz@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Legos?  Train tracks, blocks, gears for fridge or board, frigits<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(although I was surprised at how hard they were to set up), mouse trap,<br/>\ndominoes<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Amanda<br/>\n&gt; Eli 7, Samuel 6<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] contraptions for 4-yr-old","postDate":"1235795318","msgId":42730,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDkwMjI3MjAyOHk2NjlhMmVlN3hjMzhhM2JlYmVjZjFjNGYwQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDMwNDQyNi43NDQ2NC5xbUB3ZWI1MzkwNS5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDkxODkzMi40NDE1Ny5xbUB3ZWI1MzkxMi5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+CSA8MzA0NDI2Ljc0NDY0LnFtQHdlYjUzOTA1Lm1haWwucmUyLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":42728,"nextInTopic":42731,"prevInTime":42729,"nextInTime":42731,"topicId":42714,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Crazy Machines is Karl s new favorite.
