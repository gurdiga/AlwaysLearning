In the sleep thread, Joyce wrote a response:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So even if unschoolers are &quot;permissive&quot;, they may<br/>\n&gt; create a social atmosphere for their children where peer pressure <br/>\n&gt; supports<br/>\n&gt; good decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Being permissive isn&#39;t a good concept for unschooling. It also isn&#39;t a <br/>\ngood word to use for what unschoolers do since it muddies what&#39;s <br/>\nreally happening. Permissive suggests disengagement, detachment, <br/>\nleaving kids to their own devices, letting them do whatever they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is about greater engagement with kids than conventional <br/>\nparenting. It&#39;s about connecting with kids to support who they are, <br/>\nsupport their interests, help them explore the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids being allowed to enjoy wine with the family is not at all the <br/>\nsame as being permissive. The only quality they share is whether or <br/>\nnot the parents allow the kids to have alcohol. All the important <br/>\nfactors that build a healthy relationship with alcohol don&#39;t exist <br/>\nunder the &quot;Permissive&quot; label.<br/>\n==========================<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore I saw that, I had written on the under-age thread:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe term &quot;permissive&quot; isn&#39;t the same as living so closely with our kids that they really trust us.  It&#39;s not &quot;whatever.&quot;  It&#39;s &quot;Let&#39;s talk about it,&quot; and &quot;thanks for telling me,&quot; and &quot;have you considered?...&quot;<br/>\n==========================<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- But again, if we&#39;re controlling the peer group to some<br/>\n extent, she won&#39;t engage in habits that we don&#39;t engage in, unless <br/>\n there is<br/>\n external, and persistent, pressure.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThis seems to assume that people only do things other people tell them to do.  We&#39;re talking about kids who have not been school-trained, curriculum-trained, or been subjected to any operant conditioning situations.    We&#39;re talking about kids who are used to thinking and making choices, in the presence of adults who know them well and with as much advice and input as they want.   <br/>\n<br/>\nFew scientists have ever seen such people. :-)<br/>\nAnd unschoolers are not going to be a scientific study group for the benefit of anyone&#39;s research, either.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Joyce shares, or I share, or other people who have immersed themselves in unschooling philosophy and practice for a dozen years, or twenty, we&#39;re not guessing or just shooting the breeze.  We&#39;re talking about what we have seen, experienced and know.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/confidence\">http://sandradodd.com/confidence</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60611,"nextTopicId":60894}}
