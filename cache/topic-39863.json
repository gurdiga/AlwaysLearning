I talk a lot to Richard directly and indirectly (just commenting out loud) about the different kinds of smoke, the different smells.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the summer we have a lot of wildfires that last days or weeks.  We can not only smell them but sometimes we can see the smoke and the slurry planes and helicopters with buckets flying back and forth, trying to put out the fires.  Sometimes there is enough smoke in town to burn my eyes.  We also have a lot of people barbequing with mesquite and other wood in my neighborhood.  That smells different than wildfires.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the winter many people around here use fireplaces or woodstoves for warmth.  We have experimented with different types of wood in ours, some smell wonderful.  We filled our house with smoke the other night when we burned pumpkin seeds in the oven, we had made 3 batches with butter and salt and other seasonings, but my niece wanted to try one with butter and brown sugar.   It didn&#39;t work out so well, the house smelled great at first, like cinnamon rolls, the burnt sugar smell after they burned was terrible!  It was good though because we found out that one of our smoke detectors doesn&#39;t work!  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;The majority of fires start in wiring inside walls, so if you really do smell smoke and can&#39;t find the source of it, it is very likely to be in a wall.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thought of a fire in the wall is scary, especially since the smell of smoke is so common here.  I would hope that it would smell different, acrid or something, at least at first.  When we first moved into our new house one of our cats peed on an electrical outlet in Richard&#39;s bedroom.  The smell was very, well, electrical!  Gross.  It didn&#39;t start a fire but there was a scorched mark all up the wall above the outlet, and the plug for the little portable egg lights that was plugged in was burnt and ruined.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause we smell smoke so often I would probably spend more time investigating rather than call 911 right away.  The fire department in my town is manned by a combination of volunteers and police officers.  We have no paid firemen that are not also police.  I bet it would be easier around here to get one of the volunteers to come out and have a sniff than it would be in a big city.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKaty J.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: I feel so bad!","postDate":"1226029740","msgId":39897,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFENjkyRDA5LUNEQzUtNDA1Ni1BMUUxLThEQjFEMzQ0MTg4M0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdldnByaytjYXQ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdldnByaytjYXQ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39896,"nextInTopic":39919,"prevInTime":39896,"nextInTime":39898,"topicId":39863,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-In fact, my husband called the station directly at first to see if just one person could come out to check the house (house check) but they told him to call","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-687248731\">-=-In fact, my husband called the station<br/>\ndirectly at first to see if just one person could come out to check<br/>\nthe house (house check) but they told him to call 911 directly so<br/>\nthat&#39;s why we ended up with 911. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nGood idea (your husband&#39;s).

Everything <br/>\nturned out fine except for how I handled this whole incident with my <br/>\nson.  He was so scared, as expected!  However, I handled trying to <br/>\nmake him feel better so badly, I feel like such a horrible mom!  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe smelled smoke but after searching the house twice I couldn&#39;t find <br/>\nthe source of the smell.  There was no smoke and no fire so I tried <br/>\nto tell my frightened son that it was fine and that I couldn&#39;t see <br/>\nanything wrong.  Needless to say, I was a bit frightened too but was <br/>\nnot very comforting nor reassuring towards my son.  He needed me to <br/>\nreally listen and validate his fears (he wanted to go outside) and I <br/>\nwas not listening and responding to his needs AT ALL...I was trying <br/>\nto make him calm down and not be scared.  My husband (who was at <br/>\nwork) told me to call 911...I know, I should have done this right <br/>\naway but I come from a place (in my history) where I hate to bother <br/>\npeople...and since I didn&#39;t see anything, I just didn&#39;t call.  Of <br/>\ncourse, now I KNOW i should have and will if this ever happens again <br/>\nbut that&#39;s not my point here...My point is I really let my son down <br/>\nand I feel so bad!!<br/>\n<br/>\nTomorrow morning (he went to bed really early tonight) I plan on <br/>\ntalking and apologizing profusely to him but in the meantime I just <br/>\nwant to do this whole night over again!!  I&#39;d go outside with him as <br/>\nhe needed me to without question and grumpiness, hold him tight and <br/>\nI&#39;d call 911!  I know I&#39;m not perfect but this stinks!  I&#39;m using it <br/>\nas a lesson to me and I&#39;m hopeful next time he needs me so badly I <br/>\nwon&#39;t fail him.  I know I&#39;ve put a chink in our relationship tonight <br/>\nbut I&#39;m hopeful I can mend some of it back tomorrow morning.
