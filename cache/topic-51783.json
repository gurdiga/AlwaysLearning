The money can be a lovely perk if you, the parent, are willing/able to be the protective firewall between the program/MinEd expectations and your child&#39;s living/learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a conference specifically for unschoolers on &quot;The Village&quot;. You may want to find your way there and ask the other parents who unschool how they manage to keep the administrivia from having any effect on their families&#39; unschooling lives. I know that many of these families embrace radical unschooling, so you might find it a wonderful support as you sort this out for yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I don&#39;t like the weekly reporting or other necessary parental hoop jumping, so we are registered with a different independent school (and receive $150/year). Registration has no hoops at all and we are not required to follow or pay attention to any &quot;educational program&quot; other than our own. For our family, it&#39;s worth the $1000 difference in kickbacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps,<br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Defining what we do....","postDate":"1268116863","msgId":51834,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRCOTVFRDdGLjUwNjAzMDBAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhuM2FpNCtjOWtlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhuM2FpNCtjOWtlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":51809,"nextInTopic":51892,"prevInTime":51833,"nextInTime":51835,"topicId":51783,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Basically I have a learning consultant who I have to report to every week.  I write short vignettes of our week that include any kind of learning that I observe....in all aspects of his life.  The LC then takes those observations and translates them into outcomes for the BC government.  The reason that we went with this program is so that we can benefit from the 1200.00 a year that we receive.  We are able to use that money for anything that is reflected in his learning plan.  His learning plan basically was to say what his interests were at the time and say how we would support those interests.  I do not show these reports to Justin or talk about the program with him.  He knows that I write stuff about what we do but that&#39;s about it.  My LC supposedly is an unschooler himself and he hasn&#39;t questioned anything that I have written to date and has been very positive and encouraging in his feedback.
