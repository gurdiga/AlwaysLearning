With this, if your<br/>\nchild does any kind of volunteer work/project you can get up to 2,000<br/>\npoints<br/>\na year.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can go to their website www.labelsforeducat ion.com then &quot;Coordinators<br/>\nand Schools&quot; (on the left), then &quot;Manage the Program&quot;, then &quot;Advice from<br/>\nAnne&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a great program where you can get all kinds of stuff from art<br/>\nsupplies to electronics.<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy collecting!<br/>\nVallery LaBarre<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: Box Tops for Education (from General Mills) also allows homeschool<br/>\ngroups to participate, but there has to be 15+ children.
