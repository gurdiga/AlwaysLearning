Mass-mail<br/>\nworms have usually been contained in an attachment with an e-mail note<br/>\nencouraging a user to open it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe worm, written in __JavaScript, takes advantage of a vulnerability<br/>\nthat allows scripts embedded in HTML e-mail to run in the users&#39;<br/>\nbrowsers. Yahoo users should be able to modify their settings to block<br/>\nthe zero-day exploit, Hogan said.<br/>\n<br/>\nSymantec rated the worm a Level 2 threat, one notch above its least<br/>\nharmful ranking. Hogan said the worm did not appear to be spreading<br/>\nwidely, and he did not anticipate the threat level rising.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow It Spreads<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen activated, the worms then sends itself to other users in the<br/>\nvictim&#39;s address book who also use Yahoo e-mail with the suffixes of<br/>\n@... or @yahoogroups.com. The worm mimics a function within<br/>\nYahoo&#39;s Web mail called &quot;Quickbuilder,&quot; which allows a user to add<br/>\ncontacts in an address book from received e-mail, Hogan said. The<br/>\nprocess, however, is transparent to the victim, he said.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe harvested e-mail addresses are sent to a remote server. Users of<br/>\nYahoo Mail Beta do not appear to be affected, Symantec said.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe worm also opens a browser that displays a Web page that does not<br/>\nappear to contain malicious content.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough Yahoo&#39;s Web e-mail has not been fixed, users are advised to<br/>\nupdate virus and firewall definitions and block any e-mail sent from<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:av3@...\">av3@...</a>. The subject line of the e-mail with the worm says &quot;New<br/>\nGraphic Site,&quot; and the body says &quot;this is test.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo officials could not immediately be reached for comment.

Mail Accounts<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat It Is<br/>\nNew Email Threat Targeting Yahoo! Mail Accounts<br/>\n<br/>\nSymantec Security Response today identified a new worm that exploits a<br/>\nvulnerability in Yahoo!&#39;s Web-based e-mail program. The worm <br/>\nJS.Yamanner@m  spreads itself to the user&#39;s Yahoo! e-mail contacts<br/>\nwhen the user opens an e-mail infected by the worm. In addition, the<br/>\nworm also sends these e-mail addresses to a remote server on the<br/>\nInternet. Only people with an e-mail address that is on yahoo.com or<br/>\nyahoogroups.com may be impacted by this worm.<br/>\n<br/>\nSymantec currently provides antivirus detection signatures to protect<br/>\nYahoo! Mail account users against the JS.Yamanner worm. Symantec<br/>\nencourages these users to run LiveUpdate to ensure that they have the<br/>\nlatest security updates.<br/>\n<br/>\nSymantec Security Response is currently categorizing JS.Yamanner as a<br/>\nLevel 2 threat (on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being most severe). Users<br/>\nof Yahoo! Mail Beta do not appear to be vulnerable to the worm.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe e-mails can be recognized by the following title and contents:<br/>\nFrom:<br/>\nSubject: New Graphic Site<br/>\nBody: This is test<br/>\nNote: If users accidentally open an infected e-mail, they will also<br/>\nsee that their browser window is re-directed to the URL:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.av3.net/index.htm.\">http://www.av3.net/index.htm.</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo! is a popular e-mail program and is not normally affected by<br/>\nthis type of threat. There is no patch at the present time and<br/>\nSymantec is recommending that users ensure that they have the latest<br/>\nsecurity updates.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Symantec Security Response Web site provides additional details at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://securityresponse.symantec.com/\">http://securityresponse.symantec.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nProtect Yourself<br/>\nTo reduce the possibility of being affected by the JS.Yamanner worm,<br/>\nSymantec Security Response advises users to do the following:<br/>\n<br/>\nDo not open or view any emails whose subject line or address matches<br/>\nthose listed above. These emails should be deleted immediately. Ensure<br/>\nthat the latest virus detection signatures are being used. Both Norton<br/>\nAntiVirus and Symantec AntiVirus automatically download the latest<br/>\nupdates, but users can use LiveUpdate to check for updates as a<br/>\nprecaution if they so desire.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmail gateways should be configured to block emails received from<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:av3@...\">av3@...</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirewalls should be configured to block outbound traffic activity to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.av3.net/index.htm\">http://www.av3.net/index.htm</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26095,"nextTopicId":26104}}
