I prepped for Zoe&#39;s dinner out with her grandparents  <br/>\nby nonchalantly feeding them several tidbits of information about her  <br/>\nlife that they wouldn&#39;t otherwise have known.  When I replied to their  <br/>\ninvite for her I told them about her busy plans prior to having dinner  <br/>\nwith them (shopping for and making asian spring rolls with her 25 year  <br/>\nold cousin - not their grandchild; voice lessons the next day; friends  <br/>\ncoming over and staying for dinner later that day; our trip to the  <br/>\nwest coast next week that will include flying on an airplane which Zoe  <br/>\nhas no memory of having done before.) These were all things they had  <br/>\nno clue were going on in her life and I don&#39;t think she would&#39;ve  <br/>\nthought to share them with her grandparents.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, Zoe and I kind of reviewed what kinds of things she might talk  <br/>\nabout with her grandparents. I explained to her that they love her and  <br/>\nare interested in learning more about her likes and interests.

I learned  <br/>\nthat they did bring up some of the topics I&#39;d prompted them with.  Zoe  <br/>\nhad a good enough time but didn&#39;t care for the french food or the  <br/>\nnoisy restaurant patrons.  She did not report any incidents of being  <br/>\nquizzed or grilled but I didn&#39;t ask her right out either.

But the more I think about <br/>\nit the more I think maybe the kids are annoyed with it but coping and <br/>\nI&#39;m the one with the bigger issue?==<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe your kids need ways to be very clear with their grandmother about what they want. Can they just tell her point blank that they don&#39;t want to live with her, that they want to live with their parents, as it should be? If not, maybe they&#39;d like you to tell her for them. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have sort of the same issue with my mother and my oldest son. From the day he was born (maybe before that) she has wanted him for herself. The only reason I can figure out is because she has that need to feel important. She needs to appear needed by someone to the outside world even if it&#39;s an unhealthy relationship behind closed doors. She latched onto my oldest son because I was young and single when I had him so she probably thought it would be easier to undermine our familial relationship. I lived with her for the last few months of my pregnancy and the first 2 years of his life for the financial and physical support, which I&#39;m sure fueled her desire to have him for herself. <br/>\n<br/>\nOver the years she has constantly tried to convince me to have him live with her. He&#39;s 19 years old and she&#39;s still doing it. It&#39;s his choice to live with her if he wants. He lived with her for about 9 months last year but chose to come home in spite of the fact that she gave him money all the time and let him use her car whenever he wanted and bought him anything he wanted (being single and still working at home, she has more disposable income than we do and doesn&#39;t use her car much). They&#39;ve always had a very close relationship, which I&#39;m grateful for. I was not close to any of my grandparents and I feel like I&#39;ve missed out on something really special. He&#39;s old enough now to have figured out how she is on his own, though, <br/>\nso it&#39;s not much of a problem anymore. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy point in all of that is that, as long as you work at keeping your relationship with your kids strong, your mother won&#39;t have as much influence as you fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlysia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: help with relatives...","postDate":"1274279056","msgId":54262,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGh0MHNhZyttZXBtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDRCRjJGMEJCLjUwNjA5MDlAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":54261,"nextInTopic":54263,"prevInTime":54261,"nextInTime":54263,"topicId":54202,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... them down.

My mother was a public high school teacher for years but hasn&#39;t been working in that profession for at least 15 years now. As a parent, though, she was not strict or rigid about chores or homework or going to school or behaving properly. My dad is a college math professor. He just retired completely this year. He was a very strict, disciplinarian parent. He made us eat all the food on our plates, only have 2 cookies for dessert at the end of the day. He&#39;d spank us if we didn&#39;t quiet down and go to sleep at bedtime. He would get very angry if we made even the slightest mistake, like spilling a glass of milk at the dinner table.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I figured my mom would take to unschooling rather easily and I&#39;d get a lot of guff from my dad. Turned out to be the complete opposite. I had to tell my mom not to bring up anything about my kids&#39; education in front of them again because she was so nasty about it. We can&#39;t discuss it because she gets so angry with me that I&#39;m not teaching them. My dad, on the other hand, has never questioned anything I say or do. I thought he&#39;d give me lectures about putting the kids to bed at a reasonable time and making them eat all their green veggies but he hasn&#39;t said a word. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s less about what they think about home- or unschooling and more about knowing boundaries. My dad understands that these are my kids and I can screw them up all I want, thank you very much. ;) My mom has this sort of manipulative, behind-the-back need to be the most important person so she tries to undermine me and what I do in front of my kids. Interestingly, she doesn&#39;t behave badly or question anything when my husband is around.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlysia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: help with relatives...","postDate":"1274195652","msgId":54231,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhzdWFzNCtkOXYxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDkzMDlDNDk5LUY4RkMtNEY2Ri1COEQ5LTQ4MkRGNEVEODlDQ0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":54230,"nextInTopic":54232,"prevInTime":54230,"nextInTime":54232,"topicId":54202,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Some of the problems I saw were more of a problem for me than they were for my kids, because they didn&#39;t have all the history with my mom that I did.  I had to work at keeping my reactions to my parents my own, and to let my kids have their own.<br/>\n<br/>\n I talked with my kids at length about how they felt about their time together and let my kids be the ones deciding what was right for them. However, we did not often let them spend time alone with their grandparents when they were younger and more vunerable to their manipulative conversation tactics. It was difficult at times because the grandparents could afford to offer them lots more opportunities for travel and activities than my DH and I could.  We payed our own way to be a part of trips/activities that they funded for our kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne mistake I think I made was letting my parents know that my children could choose to go to school if they wanted.  That left the door open for my mother to try to sway them into going to school. My kids started to feel that they &quot;should&quot; go to school, not that they really wanted to.  She made it seem like they were missing out on something that they would regret later.  She created such doubt and insecurity in my kids that I finally told her to not talk to them about school at all. If she had any questions at all, she was to come directly to me.  I answered her questions and gave her printed articles and links to learn more, in an attempt to alleviate her fears about their future.  She still doesn&#39;t understand our &quot;unstructured&quot; life, but we made it clear that she has to accept it if she wants to be a part of our lives.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think I am as far from confrontational as I can be, but when it comes to my kids, I find lots of courage to speak up.  I would definitely talk to your mother about the e-mail, because these things don&#39;t just go away.  If you think that your mother&#39;s attitude and/or actions are detrimental to your kids&#39; well-being, you have every right to stop it.  Whether that means talking things out with her, or it means always being with the kids when they&#39;re with their grandparents, or cutting down/out contact all together, is up to you.  And what you decide to do may change over time.  Now that my kids are older they are able to say, &quot;Oh that&#39;s just how Grandma is, &quot; and brush it off.  Let your kids feelings about it all help guide your decisions, and the responses you get from talking to your mom should help give you  more clarity.<br/>\n<br/>\nWishing you all the best as you sort this out.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeanne<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kelly Halldorson&quot; &lt;kelly@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sigh...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I could use some help with relatives. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My mother specifically.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was *accidentally* forwarded an email that was sent between her and her three sisters recently.

(Oh my what an<br/>\nunderstatement! lol) Our lives aren&#39;t like the lives we grew up in.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe visit family less and less often and keep visits short for lots of<br/>\nreasons. I don&#39;t leave Karl alone with the grans. I happened to look<br/>\nout the window years ago during a visit, and one of them was spanking<br/>\nKarl (he was about 2 years old). His cousins got spanked by parents<br/>\nand grans, but because of how we are with Karl and the way Karl is<br/>\n(easygoing, sweet kid), the parents have said they cut way back on the<br/>\nspanking, and the spanking grandparent has become too frail to spank<br/>\nanymore. Now that things have changed a bit, Karl&#39;s ok with staying<br/>\nwith cousins alone (still rarely) but not for long periods. I used to<br/>\nthink we might be overreacting or over-thinking but now I think it<br/>\ndefinitely works out much better than Karl dealing on the spot where<br/>\nit would be easy for him to get labeled a troublemaker, which we were<br/>\nwarned prematurely about when he was younger. A troublemaker for not<br/>\nknowing what to do in very very different circumstances than what he<br/>\nhas with just the two of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your ideas because it&#39;s more typical of me (and Brian) to<br/>\navoid the subject of relatives and things to talk about than to be<br/>\nproactive. Avoidance isn&#39;t a productive default for when we *do*<br/>\nvisit.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy responses when my dad (and mom) were touting the importance of<br/>\nphonics last week were that we&#39;re using a combination of phonics and<br/>\nword recognition and several other things (li&#39;l educationese in for<br/>\ngood measure). Which is true ... not formally but there&#39;s no need to<br/>\ninsist that what I&#39;m doing is so informally done or to excite more<br/>\nworry. My parents will likely never be pro-unschooling. It would be a<br/>\nnice surprise if that happened!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad will be 80 this year. I know a lot about why he&#39;s so sternly<br/>\npro-education. He grew up very rough and went on to get a PhD in<br/>\nentomology. I can see why he&#39;s proud of his accomplishments; they&#39;re<br/>\nreally something! I don&#39;t memorize stuff like he does. He&#39;s a keen<br/>\nbotanist with a great deal of other knowledge about the sciences. I&#39;m<br/>\nonly just now getting into science myself (astronomy, an interest I&#39;ve<br/>\nnot followed up on all the years I&#39;ve had it). Since he&#39;s a<br/>\ncreationist and I&#39;m into evolution (Karl said something during our<br/>\nvisit about spiders evolving, which I thought was cool! but oops), I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know how much I can share my interest with my dad but I might<br/>\nfind some fun things he would like to talk about.<br/>\n<br/>\nExcept for the way they want Karl to look upstanding and obedient and<br/>\nall that, to sit still and answer 20 questions about his education,<br/>\nvisits with my parents are now pretty enjoyable. Somehow I manage to<br/>\nskate over the thin ice when politics or religion loom into the convo.<br/>\nAnd hey since I said that, maybe I&#39;ll go more often without Karl. Like<br/>\nfor Father&#39;s day and all. An option worth thinking about as Karl says<br/>\ngoing to see my folks is boring and he doesn&#39;t like it.

Were there other ways to learn that without the book?<br/>\n<br/>\nKarl might have no interest whatsoever in such responses, but when I  <br/>\nwas a kid I would&#39;ve LOVED it.   Not all kids are like I was, but I  <br/>\nstill do remember learning to read, and it was while I was in school,  <br/>\nbut I think it was me trying to figure out WHY they were telling us  <br/>\nwhat they were telling us.  In first grade I was in a Tarrant County  <br/>\nschool, in a rural edge of Fort Worth, and they were doing Look-Say.    <br/>\nWe moved to northern New Mexico, and it was all phonics.  So I got the  <br/>\nfull intro both ways.  I still remember some of the charts and  <br/>\nworkbook pages.  I remember challenging a teacher&#39;s decision about  <br/>\nwhether a particular illustration was a cup or a mug.  Big difference,  <br/>\nin phonics.  I told her mugs had straighter sides than cups, and what  <br/>\nwas drawn there was for sure a cup and not a mug.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Karl could talk to your dad and draw out stories and answers to  <br/>\nmake your dad think more about his own position and beliefs, it  <br/>\nprobably couldn&#39;t hurt either of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":255388392,"authorName":"Kelly Halldorson","from":"&quot;Kelly Halldorson&quot; &lt;kelly@...&gt;","profile":"kellygrafx","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] help with relatives...","postDate":"1274103757","msgId":54209,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBDRjVCNTQ1OTQxRDQ3MThCRTY0OEE2QzJENUY2NUNDQFBIUFZpZGVvVkFJTz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDRDMjY4Nzc2LTg1NkEtNDYzRi1CRUE1LTc0RUREN0UxRUQ3NkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDFFRDYzQzJDREU3ODQ0OTQ5OThFOUUyNDE1ODAyMjJDQFBIUFZpZGVvVkFJTz4gPDRDMjY4Nzc2LTg1NkEtNDYzRi1CRUE1LTc0RUREN0UxRUQ3NkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":54206,"nextInTopic":54210,"prevInTime":54208,"nextInTime":54210,"topicId":54202,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I don&#39;t remember ever not knowing what cocaine was or looked like. My father beat my mother. He was a drunk. Seriously...I could go on and on...but I won&#39;t bore you.

I appreciate the links. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI had decided to just be positive and keep the relationship all good talk thinking that would work. It doesn&#39;t seem to be. I would appear she is polluting my relationships with everyone. Yesterday my grandfather (paternal) called. He had spoken to my mother. And he was particularly harsh with me and Jeff. I did some questioning and apparently my mother wasn&#39;t kind about us. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince we are struggling and my mother has a nice house now and is retired from her job. Everyone seems to think she has her head on straight...and we just suck. Because she &quot;worked hard to get where she is in life&quot; - kind of thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nI realize I can&#39;t change it. It&#39;s wearing on me a little. I want to handle it in a good way...but it seems to be creeping up at me...the negativity and anger. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne last piece of background. In 2002 & 2004 my mother went through menopause and had two psychotic breaks. Serious, thought the TV was talking to her and such. The second time I actually got guardianship over her to get her treatment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve spent much of my adult and childhood caring for her mental well being. I think some of this whole thing is I&#39;m now focusing *all* of that energy on Jeff and the kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nI might be wrong. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for all the input. <br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] help with relatives...","postDate":"1274080545","msgId":54206,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlrWGpLVEdlM0dzVXlocU1WRWEtQk1kRlhoeGRKMmFzZHVOYmRmUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDFFRDYzQzJDREU3ODQ0OTQ5OThFOUUyNDE1ODAyMjJDQFBIUFZpZGVvVkFJTz4=","referencesHeader":"PDFFRDYzQzJDREU3ODQ0OTQ5OThFOUUyNDE1ODAyMjJDQFBIUFZpZGVvVkFJTz4="},"prevInTopic":54204,"nextInTopic":54209,"prevInTime":54205,"nextInTime":54207,"topicId":54202,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"When my parents pull this kind of stuff, Karl hates it and we back way way off the visiting.
