I checked the truth of it on urban <br/>\nlegends so it&#39;s a good warning.<br/>\n<br/>\nCia <br/>\n<br/>\nto a mere selection of all my generally curious, science-y, nukro-using<br/>\n<br/>\nfriends...  be safe and lotsa love afbb<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPLEASE READ ~ IT&#39;S FROM A FRIEND! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI was very glad to get this email from a friend, because I have been <br/>\n<br/>\nguilty of heating water in a microwave many times. You&#39;ll be glad you <br/>\n<br/>\nread it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAbout five days ago, my 26-year-old son decided to have a <br/>\ncup of instant <br/>\ncoffee. He took a cup of water and put it in the microwave to <br/>\nheat it up <br/>\n(something that he had done numerous times before). I am not sure <br/>\nhow <br/>\nlong <br/>\nhe set the timer for but he told me he wanted to bring the <br/>\nwater to a <br/>\nboil. <br/>\nWhen the timer shut the oven off, he removed the cup <br/>\nfrom the oven. As he <br/>\nlooked into the cup he noted that the water was not <br/>\nboiling. Then <br/>\ninstantly the water in the cup &quot;blew up&quot; into his face. The <br/>\ncup remained <br/>\nintact until he threw it out of his hand but all the water had <br/>\nflown out <br/>\ninto his face due to the buildup of energy. <br/>\nHis whole face is <br/>\nblistered and he has 1st and 2nd degree burns to his <br/>\nface, which may leave <br/>\nscarring. He may also have lost partial sight in <br/>\nhis left eye. While at the <br/>\nhospital, the doctor who was attending to him <br/>\nstated that this is a fairly <br/>\ncommon occurrence and water (alone) should <br/>\nnever be heated in a microwave <br/>\noven. <br/>\nIf water is heated in this manner, something such as a wooden stir <br/>\nstick <br/>\nor a tea bag should be placed in the cup to diffuse the energy. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere is what our science teacher has to say on the matter: &quot;Thanks for <br/>\n<br/>\nthe microwave warning. I have seen this happen before. It is caused by a <br/>\n<br/>\nphenomenon known as super heating. It can occur any time water is heated <br/>\n<br/>\nand will particularly occur if the vessel that the water is heated in is <br/>\n<br/>\nnew. <br/>\nWhat happens is that the water heats faster than the vapor bubbles <br/>\ncan <br/>\nform. If the cup is very new then it is unlikely to have small surface <br/>\n<br/>\nscratches inside it that provide a place for the bubbles to form. As the <br/>\n<br/>\nbubbles <br/>\ncannot form and release some of the heat that has built up, the <br/>\nliquid <br/>\ndoes not boil, and the liquid continues to heat up well past its <br/>\nboiling <br/>\npoint. <br/>\nWhat then usually happens is that the liquid is bumped or <br/>\njarred, which <br/>\nis just enough of a shock to cause the bubbles to rapidly form <br/>\nand expel <br/>\nthe hot liquid. The rapid formation of bubbles is also why a <br/>\ncarbonated <br/>\nbeverage spews when opened after having been shaken. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease pass this on to everyone you know, it could save a lot of pain <br/>\nand <br/>\nsuffering. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n___________________________________________________ <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7999,"nextTopicId":7950}}
