Not the same old.  And seriously…<br/>\nI had a very critical friend years ago, and she was (and still is) childless.  She was also a pre-school teacher (deaf and special needs) so she saw the world as a place full of children who coulldn’t learn or function without teachers to rescue them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your friend thinks that living in a different country isn’t enriching, maybe she’s jealous or resentful for some reason and is picking at you in a way that has more to do with her feelings.  Maybe not, but it’s worth a thought.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-We also travel to other countries as much as we can.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are kids who have unschooled their whole lives and not visited another country at all.  I started to say 2/3 of my kids, but the boys did spend a fun week in half-northern Ontario.  Holly travelled more because she had a friend whose family moved to England, and they took her to France from there when she visited.  That was it, for three Dodd kids.  And that’s more than lots of other families could do or afford or wish for.<br/>\n<br/>\nTravel to another country sounds like the ultimate in “getting out.”<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-We don&#39;t get to museums or concerts, we don&#39;t have a huge social network, we don&#39;t seem to do a lot of the things that may be considered as stimulating and therefore necessary for the unschooling household... hence the comment from my &quot;friend”.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your kids are content and they’re learning, don’t worry.  Schools put 20-30 kids in a room the size of most people’s living room or den, and they’re there, crowded, nearly 180 days.  Once or twice, there might be a field trip.  Maybe twice.  Sometimes they might go elsewhere on the school grounds, to see a play or something.    I think international travel is better than one or two four-hour field trips. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-The comment sent me into a bit of a tail spin because I am a bit of a hermit and society does tell us that that is not healthy right?? <br/>\nSo am I ruining my kids lives by being such a homebody or boring as my &quot;friend&quot; would put it?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one can say you are or are not ruining your kids’ lives.  Check in with them from time to time to see if they want to go and do something.  It might be that you and your husband are both introverts and have created introverted kids.  If so, keep wifi available, and watch films and listen to music and keep stimulating ideas flowing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf at some point it seems one of the kids is itchin’ to get out and you and the other kids don’t want to go, find another family and pay them to take your kid with them places!  Or offer to babysit in exchange for them taking one or two of your kids to a place or two sometimes, maybe. <br/>\n<br/>\nDon’t decide now that what you’re doing is good for the next ten or fifteen years. <br/>\nAlso don’t decide now (based on criticism from one person) that you’re ruining your kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLive well in the moment, and keep things lively.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/moment\">http://sandradodd.com/moment</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":160086224,"authorName":"","from":"ajasta_v@...","profile":"ajasta_v","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Too introverted to give my kids what they need?","postDate":"1499888284","msgId":78134,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG9rNXRxcysxamlpZXJyQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":78136,"prevInTime":78133,"nextInTime":78135,"topicId":78134,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We are an unschooling family of five and we all love it.
