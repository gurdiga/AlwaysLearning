I&#39;ve been unschooling my 9 yo daughter for the past two years. I&#39;m unable to work due to physical problems, and severe depression. He is not currently paying any child support or alimony, and this could take at least a year to get done. He&#39;s giving me $50.00 a month to keep the lawn mowed and any minor house repairs that need to get done.<br/>\n   Due to physical problems, I really can&#39;t do most kinds of work. I&#39;m having Carpal Tunnel surgery next month. There is NO WAY that I will voluntarily put my daughter into a public school ever again.  At least if I have any say in the matter.<br/>\n   Any suggestions at all from anyone?  I have applied for food stamps, welfare, and Disability.  It will take quite a while, from what I&#39;ve heard, to get Disability. <br/>\n  I have a lawyer, and she&#39;s asked for an emergency hearing to force him to pay child support and alimony at least until this goes to court. She&#39;s also asking the Judge to force husband to pay her retainer up front so that she can represent me.<br/>\n   He&#39;s never let me have access to his bank accounts, so I have no idea what he has. I know we had a little left over each paycheck after he paid all of the bills, but not sure how much. When he lived here, he gave me $180.00 every week to buy groceries, prescriptions, etc.  Granted, that didn&#39;t go very far, but I managed to make it stretch for the most part. Sometimes I&#39;d have to get him to go by and pay for some of my prescriptions. Now I don&#39;t even have that, and $50 a month won&#39;t even touch my prescriptions.  <br/>\n   Please?  Anyone have any advice?  I have applied online for help with prescriptions, but because I do still have insurance through my husband, I&#39;m not eligible for any of the programs that are supposed to help low income people.<br/>\nBelinda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43755,"nextTopicId":43843}}
