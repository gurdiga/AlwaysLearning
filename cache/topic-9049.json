I enjoy the solitude for awhile, but it doesn&#39;t <br/>\ntake too long for me to miss the presence of my girl.<br/>\nI&#39;ve got plenty to keep me busy while she&#39;s gone though.  <br/>\nPainting a room, making new curtains, moving furniture around, <br/>\npainting a bed, working on my business, and working at a <br/>\nfriend&#39;s home painting and plastering are just a few of the <br/>\nprojects I&#39;m doing while she&#39;s gone.  I&#39;m also going to a Celtic <br/>\nfestival in Nevada City in 2 weeks time.  <br/>\nThis next bit is for the resident Brits...Fairport Convention are <br/>\nplaying at the festival!!  I&#39;ve never seen them (but I did see <br/>\nHawkwind in SF in 1989 &lt;g&gt;).  It should be a laugh!  <br/>\n<br/>\nMeghan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9029,"nextTopicId":9035}}
