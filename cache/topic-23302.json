I think there were a LOT of directives given to a very<br/>\nyoung person that can&#39;t remember all that coaching, and a LOT of<br/>\nexpectations on a night that should just be FUN.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if my child is incapable of acting appropriately, I am there<br/>\nWITH him. If I deemed it really important to ring the doorbell just<br/>\nonce, or act a certain way, and I knew this child had difficulty with<br/>\nit, I would hold the child, or hold his hand and do all the door<br/>\nringing FOR him.

It sounds to me like<br/>\neveryone was a bit too focused on how this child &quot;should&quot; act, do you<br/>\nthink he felt a bit of pressure?
