She&#39;d tipped the matches out onto the front room carpet and was trying to light one without success. So I suggested we take the box and matches into the garden where it was sunny and I&#39;d show her how to do it. Sitting together on the lawn, I showed her how I lit a match - look, I hold the box tight in one hand and I hold the match like this and so on. Then I handed my daughter the matchbox and watched her practice lighting matches until they were all used up. Then we got on with our day.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn my daughter&#39;s third birthday, she asked could she light the candles on her birthday cake (Thomas the Tank Engine!). Yes, of course, my wife handed over the box of matches she&#39;d had in her hand and our daughter took out a match, closed the box, lit the match and lit the three candles one by one as if it was something she did every day. I do remember the other five or six children there had their eyes popping out of their heads that my wife and I had allowed Bronwyn to do that. And how proud Bronnie was - not &quot;Ha!

She was only<br/>\nanswering the original post not asking any questions.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think an analogy might help. A mother can say, &quot;we will go out for ice<br/>\ncream after lunch&quot;.  This is a common exchange.<br/>\n<br/>\n In an unschooling exchange where the goal is not to reward or punish a<br/>\nchild to finish a meal the mother may simply need to eat herself so she can<br/>\ndrive.  Lots of moms are short tempered from not eating or become tired.<br/>\nShe may, if the lunch is portable and the children anxious to get to the ice<br/>\ncream parlour, eat her lunch en route.  Soup travels in a mug and a sandwich<br/>\nis easily eaten while strolling.<br/>\n<br/>\nConventionally when a mother says, &quot;ice cream after lunch&quot; she is making<br/>\nlunch *the precondition *to getting ice cream.  Her intention is to withhold<br/>\nice cream in order to &quot;coerce&quot; her children into eating what she has decided<br/>\nis a wholesome meal first.  She may not see it this way.  She may spout<br/>\nsomething about consequences or even nutrition. But the fact is she is using<br/>\nher power to coerce her child into jumping through hoops for the reward.  I<br/>\nhave heard many well-reasoned arguements from mothers explaining its just a<br/>\nsequence of events, &quot;first we eat lunch and then we go for ice cream&quot;.  But<br/>\nof course if the ice cream eating only happens after lunch it is a<br/>\nreward/punishment scenario albeit thinly disguised.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn both cases the children may eat lunch prior to going for ice cream with<br/>\ntheir mothers.  In one case the children may not enjoy their treat as much<br/>\nor may see it differently because it was not an option presented lovingly<br/>\nbut a threat used against them.<br/>\n<br/>\n In a different scenario this lack of respect could even put the children at<br/>\nrisk from paedophiles because the children are preconditioned to accept pain<br/>\nor to have their wills overridden or simply taught they have to obey adults<br/>\nby adults they love.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember as a new parent reading about a London abduction described by<br/>\nPenelope Leach.  All the girls had been &quot;street&quot; proofed.  The girl who<br/>\nsaved the day was annoying to adults.  She didn&#39;t obey the strange man she<br/>\nsaid because her dad would never send a strange man to pick her up from<br/>\nschool without telling her and he always told her it was okay to think for<br/>\nherself and ask questions.  The strange man told the girls to be quiet, get<br/>\nin his car and to stop questioning his authority because they would be in<br/>\nbig trouble from their dads.  They did as they were told, except the girl<br/>\nwho knew her dad would never punish her for asking questions and being<br/>\n&quot;disobedient&quot;.  She told a teacher and the girls were unharmed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not  that people have issues with children contributing to making the<br/>\nhouse nice or putting things away or cooking.  It is that when the child is<br/>\nrewarded or punished for the contribution, many pointed out it was not<br/>\nlonger the child&#39;s gift of love but parental force driving the behaviour.<br/>\nPeople think that is not nurturing a trusting relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling parents can have expectations, principals and ideas.   For<br/>\ninstance I buy candles, and sparklers and we use them together.  I have met<br/>\nlots of kids who like to play with fire.  Many parents hope that the<br/>\ncuriousity can be squelched or ignorned and the matches hidden or just never<br/>\nin their house.  I had parents take matches from my kids, quite roughly.  I<br/>\nhave had to step in.  In some cases because their rule is kids can&#39;t have<br/>\nmatches and they don&#39;t like my kids holding the matches.

Actually I don&#39;t think the potential blocks were particularly hidden in the original post, and I learnt a lot  from the responses. <br/>\nI have been reading on this list for about a year, my daughter is 19 months old and I am a single mother. I am deschooling, gradually beginning to understand the principles of unschooling, and slowly becoming aware of how to incorporate the ideas into our lives. I am becoming much better at hearing the voice in my head and questioning it before I speak or act. I often ask myself why something needs to be a certain way. I think asking why a child needs to put his toys away before going out to play is a fundamental question to explore in an unschooling home. Twyla (my daughter) asked for a banana half way through dinner tonight. The voice in my head said &quot;You need to finish your dinner first&quot;, but why, why did she need to finish her dinner first? I gave her the banana, she ate it, then she finished her salmon pasta, then she had some strawberries. If she had not finished her pasta that would have been okay too. She might have just wanted to open the banana and not eat it, she has just learned to do that herself and is very excited about it. She might have eaten half of it and come back for the rest later. Sometimes she asks for sultanas in the middle of dinner. Often she likes to be read only the first few pages of a book before moving on to the next one, or to just look at one page. Tonight she pretended the book we were reading was eating her foot, and thought it was hilarious. If something has to be a certain way then there are all kinds of surprises that can never happen. Having to clean up before going outside to play sounds like a rule to me, and I think it is worth at least asking yourself why it is necessary. You might find that your son is learning something vastly different than what you are hoping by refusing to let him go outside until it is done. <br/>\nThank you for the clarity and clear critical examination, it helps so much.<br/>\nLilly \t\t \t   \t\t  <br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nNew, Used, Demo, Dealer or Private?

It was probably much further down the timeline from there that I began to see how much of my difficulties with wrapping my head around certain concepts or responses were due to my own history/beliefs/fears from long ago.  This group has greatly helped me to examine my thoughts and beliefs, has helped me be a much better partner to my child, a more thought-full person in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never came here looking for friends or people to make me feel okay as a mom.  I came to this group to Learn, to examine and expand ideas and concepts.  It makes me think, and privately mull over unschooling as it is interpreted through our family&#39;s life.  Sometimes, in the past, simply reading posts and responses would make me very uncomfortable, but not anymore.  I am glad I have stayed all these years, and my entire family is happier and more relaxed for it.

(which I appreciated )  I hope all those who have been redirected a bit, can understand and not take it personally.  On another unschooling group, a woman posted who &#39;has grown kids, but &quot;unschooled&quot; them&#39; supposedly , and she preceded to tell us how they had 4 basic principles in their home, and when someone does ___ they get sent to their room to reflect, &#39;but its their choice&#39;, and many other rules, etc.(her initail tone was VERY authoritarian   etc.......It wasnt unschooling at all.....and many people popped up to say so.......)She became offended, etc... then the &#39;debate&#39; started.    The group moderator stated that the purpose was to help others understand what unschooling is, and that that didnt sound like unschooling to her either.  But many felt it necessary to coddle and stroke the initial poster. She now is one of the main posters lately, and I can barely stand to read the posts.  The tone of the group seems lost,and the message mixed as to what unschooling and attachment parenting really are about.  I respect that this group stays true to its message.  I would hate for a newcomer to see those posts and assume for ex that making a 2 yold  pick up or he cant do ___ is unschooling.  <br/>\nI like that the moderators are active here, and keep it on track.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-But the list has a description at Yahoo, a welcome letter with an<br/>\n&gt; explanation and a suggestion to read for a while to get a feel for it.- <br/>\n&gt; =-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is that welcome letter arriving?

Like I said,  I was just curious about the reaction she got, but from someone who has just been reading the posts here I can really see were she probably got upset over the whole thing.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152225734,"authorName":"Dawn Falbe","from":"&quot;Dawn Falbe&quot; &lt;dawnfalbe@...&gt;","profile":"astrologerdawn","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Curious","postDate":"1089141863","msgId":19993,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTQwMWM0NjM4ZSRkYWQxNmI4MCQzOTAxYThjMEBkYXduPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwODkxMjgwNDQuNzE1LjgzMzE5Lm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":56230,"prevInTime":19992,"nextInTime":19994,"topicId":19993,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I guess in some ways I m glad I grew up in England because we have a different system, albeit a system, for separating the kids and we don t have grades.

When people start to talk to me about someone being in 7th<br/>\ngrade of whatever grade it is I usually stop them and say &quot;and what age<br/>\nis that&quot;.  In all the 22 years of living in America I have never<br/>\nbothered to either learn or remember what age goes with what grade....<br/>\nNow I know why... Because it wasn&#39;t going to be relevant to my life or<br/>\nmy kids lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nZak nearly 9 says &quot;I&#39;m not in a grade I&#39;m homeschooled&quot;... Most of the<br/>\ntimes that enough for the kids he comes across and then they just start<br/>\nplaying together.  When people tell me what grade their child is in many<br/>\ntimes, although I&#39;m doing this less, I will say &quot;oh how sad that your<br/>\nkids go to that prison all day, what did they do wrong that would make<br/>\nyou want to send them there?&quot;  Of course people don&#39;t often want<br/>\nanything to do with me after that... Which again is ok.  I&#39;ve stopped<br/>\nsaying that now and have found sometimes it&#39;s best to just say &quot;there<br/>\nare no grades in his school&quot; and leave it at that.<br/>\n<br/>\nNamaste<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn F<br/>\nTucson.
