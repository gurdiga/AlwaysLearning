It takes self awareness, to a large <br/>\ndegree.  If a person is fairly self aware, the what and why tends to get tied <br/>\ntogether.  That produces more clarity.  If you are clear and do consider the <br/>\nwhat and why, then what you DO is what it&#39;s all about.  What you DO should, to <br/>\nsome extent, show when out and about.  If it doesn&#39;t, or if what you DO isn&#39;t at <br/>\nall fitting with the whats and the whys, then you are really just living in BS <br/>\nland.
