On the first day, I took them over there and learned the course was already full, Joe was registered, Dan was not.  I waited for the instructor  and asked if he would mind adding one more to the class. The instructor (who I immediately thought was an older looking guy, probably my age, though - ha, and looked somewhat conversative), took one look at Dan and said,  &quot;He can stay in the class if he cuts his hair.&quot;  (Dan has long shoulder length dreads.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI smiled and then laughed out loud, he meant it as a joke, sort of . . maybe the way Archie might have said it.  I recognized it from a comment my dad would have made and I was reminded of a time when hair length was a major dividing factor between generations.  This conversation about All in the Family reminds me of this incident; which happened two days ago.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI asked Dan about it later, if the guy mentioned his hair again, &quot;Only once, but he&#39;s an OK guy&quot;, Dan said.  It lead to a conversation about hair and judgement and different generations and what hair means, or can mean, or used to mean . . . and how hair gets talked about differently whether we&#39;re with black friends with really kinky hair, or mixed race friends with &quot;soft&quot; hair . . . it went on and on.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53976,"nextTopicId":53818}}
