I&#39;m not jealous at all... When I say there is a fight inside, it was inconscient, at the beginning. I have 9 years of therapy behind me, and I had the time to know myself very well for some things.. But I think nothing is so helpfull, but hard, then children to make get off those things we have inside us, because of our childhood. It&#39;s not jealousy, but just repetition, inconscient repetition, even if I don&#39;t want to do them what I lived myself. It&#39;s better and better, but I think that if we don&#39;t want to repeat, it&#39;s something very hard to work, because of the inconscient. Again, with children, the willpower doesn&#39;t work at all, since we know about our own childhood, and work on it. Sometimes, I react like my mother reacted with me, even if I don&#39;t want, even if I can&#39;t stand that kind of react at all. I just do the same, like mimicry, and I know I don&#39;t want to do this way. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can relive your childhood in an improved, healing, soothing way by  <br/>\ngiving the ideal childhood to your children.<br/>\n*************** Yes, now I&#39;m sure about it, I just see it since a few days... It&#39;s very new for me, but I can feel something, I can feel what it is... And I had the &quot;tilt&quot;, so, I&#39;m sure I will go on..<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your parents had known what you know now, would they have been nicer to  <br/>\nyou?  Forgive them. <br/>\n*************** I think I did. But again, I think I forgived them without wanting to. It&#39;s just happened, because of all this work I did whith myself, all those years, and espacially because of my children. Their births change something in me, I let all my anger, my hate for my mother. Now I feel in peace with them. Before this &quot;tilt&quot;, I tried and I tried, but it&#39;s the same thing, the willpower doesn&#39;t work. I don&#39;t think we can forgive by the willpower. One day, something coming inside, and it comes. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSylvie (Eliott le Magicien, Tom le Héros et Lilou la Fée)<br/>\nwww.yourtes-tipis.com<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, January 11, 2005 6:39 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning]TV was Hello<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning]TV was Hello","postDate":"1105465141","msgId":21448,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFhNi4yZjE3N2I2YS4yZjE1NjkzNUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":21435,"nextInTopic":21460,"prevInTime":21447,"nextInTime":21449,"topicId":21406,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/11/2005 2:54:09 A.M.
