Set her up so she can succeed on her own terms rather than expecting her to use skills she&#39;s not capable of using yet.

It&#39;s like trying to teach reading to a child who isn&#39;t ready - you can teach and teach and teach but it won&#39;t help. She&#39;s not ready to read the cues you&#39;re pointing out. So it&#39;s better not to put her in situations where she&#39;ll be running roughshod over others&#39; feelings - better for them and for her, too.

Given the choice, she might rather *avoid* those people - but if she&#39;s stuck with them she&#39;ll exclude them. Give her the option of avoiding them so she&#39;s not set up to hurt their feelings in the first place. <br/>\n  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I also notice that my anxious anticipation of &#39;trouble&#39; in social  <br/>\n&gt; situations, or interference when she is upset often makes the  <br/>\n&gt; situation worse<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Interfere sooner - by keeping play dates small, for instance, and just with someone she gets along with fairly well.

It&#39;s why I often ask people to  <br/>\nimagine their husband or best friend doing to them what they&#39;re doing  <br/>\nto their child.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my daughter said to me after I spilled something, &quot;That&#39;s your  <br/>\nmess. You need to clean it up,&quot; it was a wake up call. If I thought it  <br/>\nwas sweet to hear someone say, &quot;Let&#39;s get that cleaned up,&quot; I needed  <br/>\nto say that to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you&#39;re talking to your child or your husband, would you want them  <br/>\nto be weighing and judging how well you&#39;re communicating and then  <br/>\ncorrecting what they feel you&#39;re doing wrong? It would be sort of like  <br/>\nliving in a critique without ever signing up for it! Or would you want  <br/>\nthem to focus on understanding your meaning and ignore the delivery?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you need a self-test, ask yourself if he&#39;s hurting anyone right  <br/>\nnow, right this minute. *Trust* that at 13 he won&#39;t always be using 8  <br/>\nyo ways of communicating just as he&#39;s not using 3 yo ways of  <br/>\ncommunicating now at 8. Trust that biology will take care of some.  <br/>\nTrust that experience and figuring things out for himself will take  <br/>\ncare of some.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he is hurting you repeatedly several times a week, the first thing  <br/>\nto examine is if you might be too sensitive. You need to give him  <br/>\nleeway to be someone who is still figuring the world out. If he really  <br/>\nis being deliberately rude, knowing he&#39;s hurting you, the second thing  <br/>\nto examine is where you or life is hurting him. Needing to hurt  <br/>\nsomeone else is often a good indication of needs and self that are  <br/>\nbeing trampled on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been bugging me for a while that the concept of helping a child  <br/>\nlive in the world could get interpreted as you did and get translated  <br/>\ninto telling them everything they&#39;re doing wrong. Eg, handing them the  <br/>\nright way to do and be. Which is what schools do! Which is what  <br/>\nconventional parenting is about.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is there really is no other relationship people are  <br/>\nfamiliar with that is like the concept we&#39;re trying to explain!  <br/>\nThere&#39;s nothing to compare it to help people make the mental shift  <br/>\nfrom molding and shaping to being a child&#39;s partner or being on the  <br/>\nsame team (as Sandra often expresses it). Most other relationships  <br/>\nwhere one person is more knowledgeable than the other is about being  <br/>\nthe imparter of wisdom like a teacher or coach, or being a resource  <br/>\nthe learner calls on when they&#39;re stuck like a mentor.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re the shapers of the atmosphere around them: bringing the parts of  <br/>\nthe world to them they might find intriguing, making what they&#39;re  <br/>\ntrying to reach more reachable, being peaceful and moving the  <br/>\nenvironment towards peace. We&#39;re attuned to their needs, responding to  <br/>\nphysical needs the child may be ignoring for more interesting things,  <br/>\ntrusting the child is learning when they&#39;re trying things that have  <br/>\nunintended results, being there as a resource. We&#39;re also there to  <br/>\npartner with them, to be the buffer between their needs and the rest  <br/>\nof the world to find respectful and safe solutions to what they&#39;re  <br/>\ntrying to do. We use our values as tools to help them meet their needs  <br/>\nrather than as tools to shape them into better people.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of that is easy to get across ;-) For example, people will get  <br/>\nthe idea of letting the child figure things out but then turn it into  <br/>\na rule and not help when the child is struggling. The principle is to  <br/>\nhelp as much as *the child* needs you to help. The principle of  <br/>\ngetting unschooling is to dig beneath the what to get at the why.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":199045059,"authorName":"Mica","from":"Mica &lt;mica.meerbach@...&gt;","profile":"micaherself","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] overcorrecting?","postDate":"1310023585","msgId":61790,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBK054Q0dhaTc9bVJHdj1YWTZrUTBteDloRGdXNEZxTDIxalR0dzJHYUJxd21pclN2UUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGl2M2dwMStpdmxyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGl2M2dwMStpdmxyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61789,"nextInTopic":61793,"prevInTime":61789,"nextInTime":61791,"topicId":61788,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This query struck a chord with me.

It seems similar to the things I&#39;ve done<br/>\nin the past, and may yet do if I don&#39;t work my way around it.  So I hope<br/>\nthat sharing my thoughts now might at least help me in that &#39;working&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, when my sons have communicated with me, I&#39;ve reacted to either<br/>\nthe language or tone or a style that bothered me by analysing or judging it<br/>\nas non-constructive or rude or irritating or any number of other slightly<br/>\nnegative types which appeared to me to need my guidance towards more useful<br/>\nmeans of expression.  Sometimes I would eventually realise that I was<br/>\nwanting them to do all the work of communicating: to understand me and my<br/>\nstyles and choose ways that will reach me comfortably - even sometimes<br/>\nperhaps to adjust their feelings and needs so that I wouldn&#39;t need to.  That<br/>\nstill sounds nice - but I recognise it as unrealistic and unfair and lazy of<br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found the principles and metaphors behind the otherwise awkward phrasing<br/>\nof Marshall Rosenberg&#39;s &quot;Compassionate Communication&quot; instructive for me, as<br/>\nthey gave me something different and most important to Listen for.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nalways known that one must listen, but my earlier understanding was that it<br/>\nwas to listen for facts and reason in order to logically contribute towards<br/>\nreasonable action. I still do that but Marshall&#39;s explanations of empathy<br/>\nand connection made sense and matched my rare experiences of being heard and<br/>\nHearing underlying needs without judgement.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my challenge has become: when I hear styles or tones or words of<br/>\ncommunication that trigger my judgements, to remember my &quot;giraffe ears&quot; and<br/>\nlisten for what may be behind the communication which I think I&#39;d have<br/>\npreferred to hear differently; and *then* rather than teach my sons to speak<br/>\nto me differently, to respond to that key message rather than the words that<br/>\nemitted.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlong the way, mini-steps have been: when I do recall my challenge, closer<br/>\nand closer to my &quot;correction&quot;, I attempt to make up for it - I add a guess<br/>\nat understanding and offer to meet the message that being conveyed.  Lately<br/>\nI&#39;ve been able to stop myself from correcting and Hear the message.<br/>\nOccasionally I&#39;ve even managed a humourous response.  A few times I&#39;ve also<br/>\nrecognised and verbally appreciated when my sons have communicated difficult<br/>\nthings for me to hear in ways that I hear most easily, or when they&#39;ve<br/>\ninterpreted my own negative communications compassionately.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh another thing I did sometimes and the boys enjoy it with me, is to break<br/>\ndown parts of my corrective language like: &quot;You don&#39;t have to...&quot; with &quot;No<br/>\nI/you don&#39;t have to, but it somehow expresses part of my feeling just now&quot;<br/>\nor &quot;It might be more effective if you....&quot; with &quot;well sure some other way<br/>\nmight be more effective but what came out was this, so let&#39;s Listen to it&quot; -<br/>\nin other words, I remind myself that my &quot;correction&quot; is no so helpful itself<br/>\nand it is by-passing / ignoring the intended message.  My sons were  young,<br/>\nthey didn&#39;t need the meta-communication back then.<br/>\n<br/>\nHoping you find ways to peace and understanding in your family.<br/>\n<br/>\nMica<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, Jul 7, 2011 at 3:38 PM, Lisa &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lisa@...\">lisa@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My son is 8.
