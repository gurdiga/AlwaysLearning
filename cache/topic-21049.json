The co-worker had gone to the doctor <br/>\ndisplaying some symptoms (I don&#39;t know what they were), and had <br/>\ngotten a little upset that the doctor decided to research the <br/>\nsymptoms and what their cause could be before giving a diagnosis. <br/>\nThis patient had wanted an instant diagnosis, and figured that the <br/>\ndoctor must not be very good if he had to &quot;look things up&quot;.  My DH <br/>\nthen told him that it&#39;s better to be sure of a diagnosis than to just <br/>\nstart treatment for something without knowing for sure if it&#39;s the <br/>\nright one.  But this guy just kept going on and on about how doctors <br/>\nneed to know everything and should never have to look things up.  My <br/>\nDH and I both agreed (when we discussed this later) that we&#39;d prefer <br/>\na doctor to look things up if he/she isn&#39;t totally sure because some <br/>\nsymptoms come up in different illnesses.  (We do have a doctor who <br/>\ntends to diagnosis things off the cuff, and I&#39;ve had to insist that <br/>\nhe test for something that I knew I had - strep throat - when he <br/>\nwas &quot;absolutely sure&quot; that it was the flu.)  Of course, there are <br/>\nsome things doctors need to know; my point isn&#39;t about what a doctor <br/>\nshould or shouldn&#39;t know.  But this is an example of how our society <br/>\ntends to see the end of education as being a head full of <br/>\ninformation, and this guy&#39;s doctor obviously didn&#39;t &quot;pass the test&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nJenny<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Nichole Fausey-Khosraviani&quot; <br/>\n&lt;ms_fausey@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What a fabulous article!

He is only 12 and if he  needed or wanted to spell better, I am sure he <br/>\ncould learn, and I would even  help him if he wanted.  I am not sure that if <br/>\nhe had *formal schooling*, he  would do any better.  His spelling has improved <br/>\nin the last year, basically  due to talking to people online and keeping an <br/>\nonline journal.  Of course,  these activities have not improved his handwriting <br/>\nany.<br/>\n <br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t worry about it.   For one thing, he is only 12.  And there are <br/>\nplenty of public school 12  year olds who can&#39;t spell.  And a 12 yo usually <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t need to know how to  spell.
