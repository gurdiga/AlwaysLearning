Having spent a year and a half immersed in the campus  <br/>\nculture, Rosin weaves a deft and honest narrative of evangelical  <br/>\neducation, combining historical background (the roots of evangelism,  <br/>\nthe story of founder Michael Farris), close observation and skeptical  <br/>\nwit. Among other students and faculty, Rosin introduces Derek, the  <br/>\nfresh-faced, idealistic political volunteer; and Farahn, who gave up  <br/>\ndancing for the Lord. Making it clear that the American evangelical  <br/>\npopulation is growing in political and cultural influence, Rosin  <br/>\nprovides an illuminating, accessible guide to the beliefs, aspirations  <br/>\nand ongoing challenges of its next generation. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] statistics","postDate":"1217213892","msgId":36867,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhFN0Y1OUVBLUZGQUItNEQ5Ny05QjAzLTQzQ0VDMkI2NjBCRkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDJEQjY1MTgzLTMyMjUtNDUwQy1COTNGLUY1RDIyNzk1RDZDN0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGc2ajc5OCtsbHV0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MkRCNjUxODMtMzIyNS00NTBDLUI5M0YtRjVEMjI3OTVENkM3QHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":36864,"nextInTopic":36868,"prevInTime":36866,"nextInTime":36868,"topicId":36863,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

If it&#39;s not true now, it was ten years ago  <br/>\nwhen there was a big survey and people said why they were unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy does it make you mad, though?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if it made mer mad that people who didn&#39;t live in New Mexico  <br/>\ntried to tell me stuff about New Mexico?  Someone who has read recent/ <br/>\ncurrent articles or history or who just knows a lot about some aspect  <br/>\nor other of government or geology could EASILY tell me things about  <br/>\nNew Mexico that I don&#39;t know.  I have a friend who knows WAY more  <br/>\nEnglish history than probably anyone in England knows, outside of a  <br/>\nsmall handful of medieval history professors, and he was there once  <br/>\n(to be in the re-enactment of the Battle of Hastings a few years  <br/>\nago).

It&#39;s not a secret society or anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt kinda bugs me when people who are  homeschooling like to assume  <br/>\nthey&#39;re the norm or the average.  NO unschoolers are the norm or the  <br/>\naverage.  There are way (WAY) more families using school-at-home, and  <br/>\nsome of them don&#39;t even know we exist.  That&#39;s fine.  But I don&#39;t  <br/>\nthink it&#39;s nearly as fine for unschoolers not to know of the huge  <br/>\nconservative body of Christian homeschoolers in the United States.   <br/>\nSome countries are spared.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone here is unaware of the HSLDA, of Bob Jones University&#39;s  <br/>\nties with unschooling, with  (is it Liberty College?) the college  <br/>\nthat&#39;s preparing young homeschooled men to take over the U.S.  <br/>\ngovernment?
