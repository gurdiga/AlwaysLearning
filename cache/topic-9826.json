This is new!  What&#39;s this?  How&#39;s it <br/>\nwork? Huh?   How&#39;s that saying go...  A hero is a coward (ie, nervous <br/>\nperson) who forgot to stand still.  Being nervous doesn&#39;t make you wrong, <br/>\nit only means you&#39;re doing something new and that you think something &#39;bad&#39; <br/>\nwill happen if you don&#39;t get it right.  (like maybe Ed McMahon decides to <br/>\nNOT stop at your door with that big check.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes it help to remind yourself that literacy was higher BEFORE <br/>\ninstitutionalized schools (or Unit Studies) were in place?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, the Unit Study stuff doesn&#39;t seem to be working and maybe after 10 days <br/>\nyou haven&#39;t given it a fair chance...  after all, you say that you don&#39;t <br/>\nwant them to &#39;waste days and not learn a thing!!&#39;  I&#39;d have to agree with <br/>\nyou that y&#39;all should stop wasting any more time with that Unit Study thing <br/>\nand let them finally get down to learning something interesting.  After <br/>\nall, aren&#39;t 10 days enough to use up on that sort of thing?  If you don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to waste your money and you really like the thought of a Unit Study, <br/>\nyou could maybe do it yourself and leave your kids free to learn what <br/>\nthey&#39;re interested in.  Happiness all around! (grin)<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, okay.  seriously.  You&#39;re not going to stop being nervous until <br/>\nyou&#39;ve actually jumped in and TRIED really unschooling and you finally see <br/>\nthat it really IS working for your kids.  And yes, it may take some time <br/>\nfor them to work out of your schoolishness.<br/>\n<br/>\nNobody can give you the security you seek besides yourself.<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\nHeidi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;only on Day 10, so maybe I&#39;m not giving it a fair chance.

I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll just let them waste days and<br/>\n&gt;not learn a thing!! Can anyone empathize with me? Surely there must<br/>\n&gt;be someone out there!

I just joined this <br/>\ngroup simply because I have homeschooled for 6 yrs, am not quite <br/>\ncomfortable with any curriculum I&#39;ve used, but scared of unschooling <br/>\ntoo. Textbook learning seems to be too much memorization, ace the <br/>\ntest, and forget it (which is the mail reason we hs in the first <br/>\nplace); therefore I don&#39;t like testing. I&#39;ve tried to be <br/>\nan &quot;unschooler&quot; but I get too nervous that one day I&#39;ll regret that <br/>\nthey really needed certain knowledge that they just don&#39;t have. This <br/>\nyear we&#39;re doing a unit study, but we seem to be getting bogged down <br/>\nwith the &quot;have to learn&quot; stuff and aren&#39;t really enjoying it.
