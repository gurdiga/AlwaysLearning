Homework and exams are all<br/>\ndone on the computer.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr is she saying because there are fewer reasons to handwrite that she&#39;ll<br/>\nmake sure she holds onto reasons even if better ways come along?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut they could still print.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of the arguments are confusing handwriting and cursive.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Even the SAT  college-admissions test still requires each student, at the<br/>\n&gt; end of the test,  to copy several paragraphs stating that he or she did not<br/>\n&gt; cheat.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m betting it&#39;s not required to use cursive. In fact *most* forms ask for<br/>\nprinting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Rather than simply signing a written statement, students are asked  to<br/>\n&gt; write out the paragraphs so that the College Board -- which gives  the<br/>\n&gt; test -- has a copy of the student&#39;s handwriting in case verification of  the<br/>\n&gt; student&#39;s handwriting is needed later.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So it&#39;s like a fingerprint. It doesn&#39;t make any difference if it&#39;s readable<br/>\nor not, just so that it can be compared to another sample of the student&#39;s<br/>\nhandwriting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We just don&#39;t emphasize the importance of handwriting as a  culture<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again sad when people don&#39;t like what we like. It&#39;s sad when parts of what<br/>\ndefined the past fade away because they aren&#39;t as useful anymore. There used<br/>\nto be far more people who could plant a garden, sew clothes, cook from<br/>\nscratch, butcher a hog, prime a pump, crank an engine ... The time spent<br/>\nwith those things is replaced with other more currently useful things. It&#39;s<br/>\na *lot* more useful to know how to search with Google than to crank an<br/>\nengine! Or even write a legible paragraph in cursive.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; in India<br/>\n&gt; and Great Britain, they don&#39;t have as much in technological uses, so  more<br/>\n&gt; pride is taken in one&#39;s written work and how it is conveyed.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And in India they can cook curry better than most people in America. And in<br/>\nEngland most people will recognize the names of the kings and queens better<br/>\nthan most people in America. Different cultures have different needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Although the future of cursive writing is not known, some say there  will<br/>\n&gt; always be value in learning the old-fashioned art<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Calligraphy is alive and well among those who love the art of it even though<br/>\nmost people don&#39;t even own dip pens!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;And, even though more and more people are using e-mail  to<br/>\n&gt; communicate with each other, there&#39;s still much value to the personal  letter<br/>\n&gt; ... and that will never go away.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a whole lot more value in anything when it&#39;s a choice rather than<br/>\ndone because others want everyone to hold onto the past.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Lost Art of Penmanship","postDate":"1106172259","msgId":21658,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUwLmIzODUwNTYuMmYyMDMzNjNAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":21665,"prevInTime":21657,"nextInTime":21659,"topicId":21658,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Parts are sad.

Parts are spot  on....<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n <br/>\nLost art of penmanship<br/>\nBy Natalie Troyer<br/>\nTHE WASHINGTON  TIMES<br/>\nPublished January 18,  2005<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n----<br/>\nLike  8-track tapes, Atari video games and the rotary-dial phone, cursive<br/>\nwriting  may soon become a casualty of technological advance, as the word<br/>\nprocessor  squeezes penmanship lessons from schools nationwide.<br/>\nLearning  the loops of cursive writing might seem like a waste of time to<br/>\nstudents and  teachers who are accustomed to the computer as the principal<br/>\ntool of  communication. The National Cursive Handwriting Test -- a<br/>\n75-year-old  tradition -- recently was canceled because of a lack of entries.<br/>\nBut  educators say cursive writing is a communication tool that deserves to<br/>\nbe  upheld in elementary schools today.<br/>\nStudents still need to know  how to communicate effectively through good<br/>\nhandwriting skills, said Charles  B. Pyle, director of communication at the<br/>\nVirginia State Department of  Education.<br/>\n&quot;There will still be occasions when students need to  express themselves<br/>\nwith pen and paper, and what they write should be read and  understood<br/>\nwithout a lot of difficulty,&quot; he said.<br/>\nBoth  Maryland and Virginia&#39;s state curriculum for elementary schools<br/>\nindicate  that, by second grade, students should begin making the transition<br/>\nto cursive  writing, using connecting strokes to write continuous text. By<br/>\nthird grade,  students are expected to write legibly in cursive, moving from<br/>\nthe  instruction level in the classroom to a more independent level.<br/>\n&quot;The long-term goal is to develop neat, legible and rapid handwriting,&quot;<br/>\nMr.  Pyle said. &quot;Our standards don&#39;t emphasize a method, but expect  an<br/>\noutcome.&quot;<br/>\nAdvocates say teaching penmanship has benefits,  citing research evidence<br/>\nof a direct link between the process of learning to  write and developing the<br/>\nability to read fluently.<br/>\n&quot;Cursive  writing itself was developed because connected strokes help<br/>\ncreate a  continuous stream of writing,&quot; said Dixie Stack, director of<br/>\ncurriculum at  Maryland State Department of Education. &quot;When you first look<br/>\nat cursive  writing, it&#39;s like trying to interpret a foreign language.<br/>\nWorking at it --  and practicing it yourself -- though, helps you to read<br/>\nit.&quot;<br/>\nRoger Vanderhye, principal of Spring Hill Elementary School in McLean,<br/>\nsaid  cursive writing is &quot;not a lost art quite yet.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;We still  believe that fluid writing leads itself to thinking ... we&#39;ve<br/>\nseen that  students&#39; ideas start to flow better when they learn cursive,&quot;  he<br/>\nsaid.<br/>\nHeidi Hogan, reading and writing specialist at  Spring Hill, agrees.<br/>\n&quot;Keyboarding hasn&#39;t replaced cursive,&quot;  Mrs. Hogan said. &quot;Even with<br/>\ntechnological developments, we still feel it&#39;s  important for students to<br/>\nknow how to write. Most children actually enjoy  cursive ... they see it as a<br/>\nrite of passage or a &#39;grown-up thing to do.&#39;  &quot;<br/>\nThe process also helps students who have problems with  reversed letters<br/>\nin their handwriting.<br/>\n&quot;Once students make  the transition to cursive, they don&#39;t make the same<br/>\nkind of mistakes,&quot; Mrs.  Hogan said.<br/>\nSome say reliance on computers is hurting the art  of penmanship,<br/>\nhowever. According to the National Telecommunications and  Information<br/>\nAdministration, 90 percent of Americans children ages 5 to 17 use  computers.<br/>\nCharles Trafford, chief executive of Peterson  Directed Handwriting, a<br/>\nPennsylvania-based instruction company that sponsored  the recently canceled<br/>\ncursive writing contest, said he was appalled by the  quality of entries that<br/>\nhe received from teachers across the country who felt  the entries were<br/>\nexamples of good handwriting.<br/>\n&quot;We had  thousands of teachers sending in handwriting samples that could<br/>\nonly be  described as garbage,&quot; he said. &quot;They were just terrible.&quot;<br/>\nTeacher-education programs might be one cause, instructors say,  because<br/>\nminimal time is spent teaching cursive to future teachers.<br/>\n&quot;There&#39;s just so much content to be taught to future educators  that<br/>\ncursive writing is simply not emphasized in teacher education,&quot;  said<br/>\nPatricia Young, assistant elementary-education professor at the  University<br/>\nof Maryland.<br/>\nMore emphasis is placed on using the  computer as a tool to aid the<br/>\nwriting process, ultimately placing more  emphasis on what students are<br/>\nwriting, rather than how they are writing it,  Mrs. Young said.<br/>\n&quot;We&#39;re simply evolving in terms of education  ... . We have a more<br/>\ncontemporary tool in computer technology, and we&#39;re  using that to develop a<br/>\nchild&#39;s writing.&quot;<br/>\nRosa Trapp-Dail,  chairman of the elementary-education department of<br/>\ncurriculum and instruction  at Howard University, said she doesn&#39;t want the<br/>\nuniversity students to be  overly dependent on technology, though.<br/>\n&quot;Writing is one  of the ways you influence the acquisition of early<br/>\nliterary skills to  children,&quot; she said. &quot;Computers have begun to share<br/>\nsignificance. But few  urban classrooms have computers for every student ...<br/>\npenmanship is a  conceptual, hand-eye coordination skill, which also needs to<br/>\nbe a part of  learning.&quot;<br/>\nMrs. Young suggests that handwriting basics need to  be taught alongside<br/>\ncomputer technology.<br/>\n&quot;When students  submit an exam, it&#39;ll be handwritten,&quot; she said.<br/>\n&quot;Penmanship and computer  skills, therefore, need to run side by side.&quot;<br/>\nEven the SAT  college-admissions test still requires each student, at the<br/>\nend of the test,  to copy several paragraphs stating that he or she did not<br/>\ncheat.<br/>\nRather than simply signing a written statement, students are asked  to<br/>\nwrite out the paragraphs so that the College Board -- which gives  the<br/>\ntest -- has a copy of the student&#39;s handwriting in case verification of  the<br/>\nstudent&#39;s handwriting is needed later.<br/>\nSome educators  say that the problem with teaching cursive writing today<br/>\nis that it tends to  come behind other curriculum priorities, such as<br/>\npreparation for standardized  tests. Others blame it on the American culture<br/>\nas a whole.<br/>\n&quot;We just don&#39;t emphasize the importance of handwriting as a  culture,&quot;<br/>\nsaid Gail McEachron, a professor at the College of William &  Mary. &quot;In<br/>\nEngland, there is a much bigger emphasis placed on penmanship ...  in India<br/>\nand Great Britain, they don&#39;t have as much in technological uses, so  more<br/>\npride is taken in one&#39;s written work and how it is conveyed.&quot;<br/>\nAlthough the future of cursive writing is not known, some say there  will<br/>\nalways be value in learning the old-fashioned art. James Beers, reading  and<br/>\nlanguage-arts professor at the College of William & Mary, said that  although<br/>\npenmanship may be declining, it&#39;s not going to disappear.<br/>\n&quot;Not all forms can be filled out online. Many must be done by hand,&quot;  Mr.<br/>\nBeers said. &quot;And, even though more and more people are using e-mail  to<br/>\ncommunicate with each other, there&#39;s still much value to the personal  letter<br/>\n... and that will never go away.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21671,"nextTopicId":21694}}
