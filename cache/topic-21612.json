Bank Of America gave it to me, I remember that it was a new pack of bills and it was the one on top.  I&#39;m almost certain know that THEY knew it was a fake and passed it off onto me.  My guess is that a teller goofed by accepting it and it was put front and center to go back into circulation.  I was out the $100.<br/>\n<br/>\nCostco called the treasury department to check the serial number, it&#39;s the only sure way to tell.  Some counterfeits can pass the marker test, I learned that from my little experience.  I never take anything larger than $20 in cash from the bank anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nKris<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Rue Kream&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:skreams@...\">skreams@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, January 18, 2005 12:51 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [AlwaysLearning] Nature Intelligence<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;For the new bills, there&#39;s a marker they run over it and if it&#39;s  a good<br/>\n&gt; one the mark disappears (???)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; **When they checked mine they had a brown marker that turns yellow if it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; fake.  ~Rue<br/>\n<br/>\n  ----------<br/>\n<br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>\nVersion: 7.0.300 / Virus Database: 265.7.0 - Release Date: 1/17/2005<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152271008,"authorName":"Rue Kream","from":"&quot;Rue Kream&quot; &lt;skreams@...&gt;","profile":"ruekream","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Nature Intelligence","postDate":"1106081497","msgId":21626,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxNDcwMWM0ZmQ5ZiQ4MTlkMTdjMCQ2NzAwYThjMEBsaXZpbmdyb29tMT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDE1ZC40ODcxZGIwZi4yZjFlY2ZiNUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":21625,"nextInTopic":21629,"prevInTime":21625,"nextInTime":21627,"topicId":21612,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... one the mark disappears (???) **When they checked mine they had a brown marker that turns yellow if it s fake.  ~Rue [Non-text portions of this message","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2028755134\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&gt;For the new bills, there&#39;s a marker they run over it and if it&#39;s  a good<br/>\n </span></blockquote>one the mark disappears (???)<br/>\n<br/>\n**When they checked mine they had a brown marker that turns yellow if it&#39;s<br/>\nfake.  ~Rue<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Nature Intelligence","postDate":"1106081205","msgId":21625,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1ZC40ODcxZGIwZi4yZjFlY2ZiNUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":21624,"nextInTopic":21626,"prevInTime":21624,"nextInTime":21626,"topicId":21612,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/18/2005 12:39:27 P.M.
