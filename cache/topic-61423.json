She is also really, really averse to wearing hearing protection.  So we warn her when something noisy is likely to happen--being mentally prepared helps a little.  When she wants to go somewhere likely to be noisy, we talk about it first, try to go when noise will be not-so-bad, and take a nice, long bath with epsom salts.  Something about the epsom salts (the magnesium, maybe?) helps noises be...not so sharp.
