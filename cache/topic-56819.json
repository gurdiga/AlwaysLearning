But if you think we pay a lot for car insurance now, just wait until you see the bills for property tax, vehicle registration and insurance, utilities, etc. if we were to live there. We did live there. It is way more cost effective to live where we do now, even if it has complications to do so. We had to leave our house in the city and could not afford a different one (like many others here). It is okay. We&#39;ve got advantages from living rural too.

It always seemed <br/>\nlike a lot, but it really wasn&#39;t comparatively speaking.  There are some things <br/>\nthat cost waaaay more and some things that cost way less.  If one of my children <br/>\ndecided to pursue ice skating competitively, I&#39;d have to come up with a heck of <br/>\na lot more money.  If one of my kids seriously became involved with skiing or <br/>\nsnow boarding, it would be the same kind of thing.  An art class at the rec <br/>\ncenter might be $25 a month, so a bit more than that.<br/>\n<br/>\nA college class is significantly more than a rec center art class, or even auto <br/>\ninsurance.  You probably can&#39;t get your money back now, but in the future, can <br/>\nyou include your son in weighing costs of things so that you can incorporate <br/>\nauto insurance into that?  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest daughter is 16.  She isn&#39;t driving yet.  We live in an area with a <br/>\ngreat public transit system and so far, she&#39;s loving the freedom of that paired <br/>\nwith the very low cost of it.  For one month, we pay $26 for her to have <br/>\nunlimited transportation anywhere in the larger metro area.  She doesn&#39;t have to <br/>\nworry about gas or car maintenance or cost of insurance.  I&#39;m in no hurry to <br/>\npush her to get a driver&#39;s license!<br/>\n<br/>\n***My son, not so much. If it does not happen very easily, with little effort <br/>\nthen he thinks it is because he is &quot;never lucky&quot;, or &quot;everyone is against me&quot;, <br/>\nor some other negative thought.***<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can help change that!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think in a way that&#39;s common.  The world is huge and overwhelming sometimes. <br/>\n Sometimes kids feel completely powerless to do anything about it.  If the cost <br/>\nof changing a kid&#39;s mental attitude is $75 a month, to give him freedom and help <br/>\nhim feel more empowered, it seems a small price to pay.  Having a job is a lot <br/>\nor responsibility.  If your kid isn&#39;t interested in that right now, it might be <br/>\ngood to back off on that.  Not all kids want that kind of responsibility.  Some <br/>\nkids need to grow into it, get their feet wet with other things before trying on <br/>\nthe big adult hat of &quot;a job&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nChamille was offered this really amazing internship.  At any time she could <br/>\naccept it.  If she waits too long, the offer may go away.  So far, she hasn&#39;t <br/>\ndone it.  She fully recognizes what a great opportunity it is and really wants <br/>\nto do it, but more than anything right now, she wants a free schedule.  She <br/>\nwants that more than an internship.  She really has given it a lot of thought. <br/>\n No amount of pushing or prodding on my part will help her.  If she wants it, <br/>\nit&#39;s there for the taking.  If I force her, she may end up being a terrible <br/>\nintern, and that won&#39;t help her be successful.  I think forcing a kid into a job <br/>\nis like that too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have your own business, why not let your son do that?  Let him help here <br/>\nand there, pitch in as needed and help him be flexible without the commitment of <br/>\na job.  If he does more for your business, you could work more hours outside of <br/>\nthe business to cover whatever expenses that need to be covered.  Maybe, instead <br/>\nof seeing it as your son making money to cover his expenses, see it as an <br/>\nopportunity for him to facilitate the work of others.  In many ways, that is <br/>\nwhat stay at home parents do for their partners who work.

Our family","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-33018880\">Hi all,<br/>\nYou are such a resourceful group of people, I hope you can help me.<br/>\nMy 16yo son, who is driving, needs to earn the money for car insurance. Our family has a very low income and we cannot afford to pay for insurance for him to drive. However, we live an hours drive from Tucson, where all the friends and activities are. I have always driven both kids (we also have a 13 yo) into town almost every day of the week. Now my so is taking a few classes at the jr.college in town, plus of course he wants to go out with his friends etc. Over the summer he worked as a lifeguard and out of what he made he paid for insurance and some of the gas money. But that job has ended now.<br/>\nThe small town we live in has a grocery store and a Walmart and a few fast food restaurants. Even though he does not really want to work at those places (and I would prefer if he did not need to) he&#39;s applied, but there are no jobs available.<br/>\nSo, my question is: what have your 16 yos done to make money? I&#39;m sure there are creative ways out there that we have not thought of yet.<br/>\nI have to add that he really does not want to work. He&#39;d rather sit and play video games and watch movies all day. So talking about it is not working so well either. But maybe if I could help him with some more fun or interesting ideas to try it would not be so bad for him.<br/>\nSo, any ideas people are willing to share?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nSybelle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56764,"nextTopicId":56917}}
