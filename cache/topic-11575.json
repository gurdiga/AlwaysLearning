When you pull a board up, the screw pops clean from the board <br/>\n(instead of sticking into it) and you can pound that out too so it looks <br/>\nlike a brand new board, ready to use!  I&#39;ve already had to pull up some <br/>\nTrex boards (I put them in the wrong spot) and just re-used them in a <br/>\ndifferent part of the deck after hammering down the raised bits from where <br/>\nthe screws were.  You can use &#39;em and reuse &#39;em until they&#39;ve got too many <br/>\nholes that&#39;ve been pounded in.  I figure that by that time, there&#39;ll be a <br/>\nway to melt them back down and make new trex boards out of them.  (To my <br/>\nknowledge, Trex is a combination of recycled plastic and wood <br/>\nfibers/sawdust (that would normally get burned as waste.))<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother cool thing, put them in the warm sun and they&#39;ll BEND to go around <br/>\ncurves.  Cool!
