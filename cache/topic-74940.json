I introduced her to Tomb Raider. &nbsp;The first game I ever fell completely in love with. And then I found her a blue t-shirt and khaki shorts, gun holsters and &#39;lara boots&#39; and plaited her hair for her. &nbsp;</p><div><br></div><div>The first time she asked me to buy her a skirt she was maybe three years old. &nbsp;We had never dressed her strictly along gender lines. &nbsp;She had various girls tops, some pink clothes but no dresses or skirts. &nbsp;I hesitated. &nbsp;She flitted on to the next thing before I had decided what to say and it was no big deal. &nbsp;But I thought about it. &nbsp;Next time I said yes right away. &nbsp;She put the skirt on outside the shop and twirled and twirled and twirled. &nbsp;It was nothing but joyful. &nbsp;<div><br></div><div>And she passed. &nbsp;She was more convincing as a girl than she had ever been as a boy. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>She never wanted her hair cut so we didn&#39;t cut it. &nbsp;Beautiful glossy golden curls. &nbsp;Everyone commented on how beautiful her hair was. &nbsp;And everyone thought she was a girl. &nbsp;Even in boyish clothes, she got called she. &nbsp;It irritated her. &nbsp;She would tell people that boys can have pretty hair too. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So she would choose girls clothes to go out in and it delighted her that nobody knew she was a boy. &nbsp;She loved that she could fool people. &nbsp;She stopped being cross when people got it &#39;wrong&#39;.</div><div><br></div><div>She is four and a half now. &nbsp;Over the last eighteen months her understanding of gender has grown a lot. &nbsp;She has had a lot of questions about gender. &nbsp;We have talked about the differences between male and female bodies, gender stereotypes and how they are not always right. &nbsp;About how you can be both male and female at the same time. &nbsp;About how some people prefer to live as the opposite gender to the one they were born as. &nbsp;About how you can be born male and grow up to have a woman&#39;s body, or vice versa. &nbsp;Not all at once. &nbsp;Lots of little drips of information when she has asked for it. &nbsp;<span style=\"word-spacing:normal;\">She knows she could be a boy who likes sparkly dresses and baking. &nbsp;She prefers to be a girl who likes play fighting with guns and swords.</span></div><div><br></div><div>Last summer she was in hospital for a week and her hair became very tangled and damaged and painful to brush so she asked to have it cut shorter. &nbsp;In the autumn we moved house. &nbsp;Because her hair is shorter, though still not short, and she was wearing boys and girls clothes, we were asked is she a boy or a girl a lot. &nbsp;She always chose to tell people she was a girl. Since then she has stopped wearing clothes she considers to be too &#39;boyish&#39;. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>She asked me to use she not he.&nbsp;<span style=\"word-spacing:normal;\">&nbsp;It took about a month to get used to and remember.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;\">&nbsp;Her other mum and other people who know her were still using he. &nbsp;I was expecting her tell them not to and I could see that it bothered her. &nbsp;I don&#39;t like stepping into her relationships with other people but it was so obviously upsetting her that I offered to speak to them for her and she looked so relieved. &nbsp; So I did and now everyone is trying to remember to use she. &nbsp;We have a kind and open minded family so it has not been a problem.</span></div><div><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;\">We live in a kind and open minded community too. &nbsp;The worst reaction she has had has been a raised eyebrow and no comment. &nbsp;The people who think it is wonderful that she is allowed to express herself and be a girl have been very much the majority. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>She once said &#39;I&#39;m pretending to be a girl but I&#39;m really a boy. I have a boy&#39;s body.&#39; and she looked terribly sad. &nbsp;I hugged her and asked which one she is on the inside. &nbsp;She said &#39;a girl&#39;. &nbsp;She said it very confidently. &nbsp;So I smiled and said &#39;then you really are a girl.&#39;

I&#39;ll try to be more brief here, but please feel free to delete if the first one came through after all.)<br><br>Vicki, my sibling &quot;living as another gender&quot; was younger than my by 4 years. I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s exactly the right expression for it, but she was born a girl, told my mom at age 4 that she wished she&#39;d been born with a penis, wanted to be called Rick or Spike, and wanted a buzz cut for her next haircut. She never liked to answer the other kids&#39; question, Are you a boy or a girl? I think if she&#39;d had more choices or certainly if the question weren&#39;t loaded, she might have found a term she felt comfortable with, but I don&#39;t think it was either of those.<br><br>This was in the Deep South in the early 1980&#39;s. I think my mom was pretty progressive in the ways she handled it at the time. She didn&#39;t let my sister get a buzz cut, but she did let her get a pixie cut. She was fine with my sister wearing leather jackets and high-top sneakers and sometimes gray facepaint on her cheeks and chin to look like a 5 o&#39;clock shadow. (And not just around the house, but to restaurants, the mall, etc.) She didn&#39;t just tolerate or even simply accept my sister, but she joyfully supported her; I remember her giving my sister gifts of a dinosaur pillowcase, a brown felt fedora, and any number of He-Man figures, Transformers, and Micromachines. She didn&#39;t ask the teachers to call my sister &quot;he&quot; or &quot;him,&quot; but she empathized mightily when my sister came home upset that she wasn&#39;t allowed to line up with the boys at the restroom break before recess. My mom was a quiet champion. She was very shy and reserved and not inclined to advocate for us out in the world, but she made our family life one characterized by solid, unwavering, loving support.<br><br>I think my sister just gradually moved into a different identity. She stopped wanting to be called Rick. She grew her hair out a bit. When she had her first communion (we were raised Catholic), she asked not for slacks and a white shirt but for a neon pink dress. (My mother took her shopping for this and bought it; what snark she had to suffer at the ladies&#39; Altar and Rosary Society meetings I don&#39;t know--she never mentioned it.) She joined the track team at school, and competed on the girls&#39; team without issue. <br><br>It is a great regret of my life that I was not more kind or supportive of my sister during this time. I was 8 to 12 years old myself, and was teased mightily for being awkward, chubby, wearing thick glasses, and going through puberty early. I didn&#39;t have the strength or the room in my heart to accommodate her differences, and I resented the negative attention my sister&#39;s ambiguous gender sometimes drew to me, by extension. <br><br>I posted about my sister when I asked the question so that others here would know that I did not ask about trans children with a gawking curiosity but rather with a sincere heart and a personal history. The unschooling lens has, for me, offered the most respectful, sensible, loving, and creative perspective when looking at past experiences, current realities, and possible futures with children, so I wanted to ask her for help seeing from that point of view.<br><br>Teresa</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128961575,"authorName":"Vicki Dennis","from":"Vicki Dennis &lt;vicki@...&gt;","profile":"vickitexan2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Safely and lovingly supporting trans children","postDate":"1413846611","msgId":74965,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBTVN1N053OVJUUkM5VE1wTWsreDZ0RE9GWEo9MkdOK3UyTXRqZnlWczZyd2t4dVNGd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG0xcHE0OCsxczNyNnA2QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG0xcHE0OCsxczNyNnA2QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":74964,"nextInTopic":74984,"prevInTime":74964,"nextInTime":74966,"topicId":74940,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Teresa, I am curious.

And these &quot;hormone blockers&quot; are also given to children who are NOT transgendered but who are, for whatever reason, experiencing puberty too early.<br><br>The benefit of hormone blockers is that they are completely reversible and, if discontinued, even fertility levels can be normal.

In fact, most of my friends who are transgender have specifically chosen not to have surgery (with the notable exception of chest reduction - which, if they&#39;re on hormones pre-puberty, should not be an issue).<br><br></div><div>- Misa<br></div></span></blockquote></div></div></div>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Safely and lovingly supporting trans children","postDate":"1413580172","msgId":74946,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU1QzBGMEVBLTFFNjMtNEVDOC05MzQ1LTE4RUY4NjQyQkUwMEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBTVN1N055T2pLVUd2WFNGdEhGRXBxMmlBRFhtczRHalZEU2RHdTIrN3Vxei1zeTdEd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG0xcHE0OCsxczNyNnA2QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPENBTVN1N055T2pLVUd2WFNGdEhGRXBxMmlBRFhtczRHalZEU2RHdTIrN3Vxei1zeTdEd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":74945,"nextInTopic":74947,"prevInTime":74945,"nextInTime":74947,"topicId":74940,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-We do not allow preteens or young teens the power of consent for sex;
