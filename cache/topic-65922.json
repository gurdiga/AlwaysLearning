Why not check each other out and show off their butts? They&#39;re squishy and it&#39;s where poop comes out. What could be funnier than that?! Why have to go behind closed doors in your own house? And especially with siblings, what&#39;s the issue? I think it&#39;s adults&#39; fears that bring on unneccesary shameful feelings. In my experience of community living with young children, little boys are always pulling on their penises when they&#39;re naked. It&#39;s often the closest thing to keep their hands occupied! I say just laugh and enjoy their innocence.Â Anyway, it passes and soon enough they pick up on our culture&#39;s intolerance for nudity. (And of course I believe if you are around strangers and/or in public you need to be more cautious about what is socially acceptable with your children and to teach them these norms.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I do have a line when it&#39;s more obviously masturbation. I remember once that my daughter (who was maybe 6 or 7) was touching herself on the couch (I can&#39;t remember if she had pants on or not - but it didn&#39;t matter) and I told her that&#39;s something to do in private. She got it. And I believe that because I neverd shamed her she is very open with me (she&#39;s 12) about things going on with her body, puberty, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my thoughts,<br/>\nErika<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":464212763,"authorName":"Miliana Johnson","from":"&quot;Miliana Johnson&quot; &lt;milianajohnson@...&gt;","profile":"milianajohnson","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Nudity and related concerns","postDate":"1330473054","msgId":65970,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGppanA4dSs3YTBmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhCMDlBREJDLTM3MjUtNDFBMS1CQUZGLTZEOUI3OUYzQTEyM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":65955,"nextInTopic":65979,"prevInTime":65969,"nextInTime":65971,"topicId":65922,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sorry if I was unclear - by privacy I meant by one s self, not with one s sibling.
