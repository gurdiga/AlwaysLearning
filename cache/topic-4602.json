Where Sandra say you were doing something wrong for your family? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe way I saw it, she was speaking to the comment that a 6 year old could be &quot;expected&quot; to deal with an adult.   I imagine that thought set an idea in Sandra&#39;s head that she felt would benefit many of us.  If you had a notion that you were trying to toughen your son up by making him stand up to the teacher, you may have read what Sandra said and thought about it a little.  The rest of us got to think about this idea as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou clarified that you were not trying to toughen up your little guy but did want him to feel he could question all people no matter their age.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a previous post, I *disagreed* with the concept that having family dinners was controlling.  After hearing my reasons, no one said they went against unschooling.  If they had I would have taken a harder look.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt another time, I explained how we handle food choices in our home.   My ideas were challenged and I gained some new insight.

If as unschoolers it&#39;s<br/>\nadvocated that we are all equal what does the teachers age have to do with<br/>\nmy six year old?  Either way I let him decide that he would speak for<br/>\nhimself with me standing right behind him.  The next week he didn&#39;t want to<br/>\ngo for the same reason he didn&#39;t want to go that week (he didn&#39;t want to sit<br/>\nin the same place), so I didn&#39;t make him go.  This week he didn&#39;t want to go<br/>\nagain and it was the last class so I didn&#39;t make him go.... I&#39;m not signing<br/>\nhim up for anymore classes unless he really wants them, but that would be<br/>\npart of learning about the unschooling process.  If this is a list for only<br/>\nseasoned radical unschoolers I was unaware of that.  Because I disagree with<br/>\n&quot;the leader&quot; does not mean I&#39;m wrong for my family.  There are no<br/>\nauthorities on unschooling.... Isn&#39;t that the whole point, that we each have<br/>\ndeal with our children the way that feels comfortable for our child and<br/>\nlearn what works and what doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have not been responding to many of the posts because I feel that I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to get into a &quot;war of words&quot;, who can say things &quot;the best&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;correctly&quot; so I&#39;ll go back to lurking, like many others and then when<br/>\nsomeone says something I disagree with I&#39;ll just think it rather than bring<br/>\nit up.  That way it&#39;s safer than having the whole of what I said pulled<br/>\napart.
