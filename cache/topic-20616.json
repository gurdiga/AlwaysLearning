I am a mom of 3 boys ages <br/>\n8, 6, 3yrs, homeschooling rather unhappily/ ambivalently for 3-4 years, <br/>\nbasically up a creek without a paddle was how I saw myself...<br/>\n<br/>\nI was at the grocery store today, I normally don&#39;t go out on weekends <br/>\nbecause it is overwhelmingly crowded in Los Angeles, that was my <br/>\nreasoning... yet I had a really great time, which got me thinking about <br/>\nall the rules and expectations I have and don&#39;t challenge... one of the <br/>\nreasons I don&#39;t challenge my own thinking is that the perspective is <br/>\njust not there, I have no perspective of myself when I am self <br/>\ncentered, which I am growing out of slowly and consciously... I am very <br/>\ngood at reasoning for control and it has been a struggle for me to let <br/>\nthings go, not be right, see things from a different side, a long windy <br/>\nroad so far in this life... having babies really brought changes, <br/>\nbecause well it&#39;s impossible to be available for anyone else with my <br/>\nego taking highest priority... so I have had a very hard time with <br/>\nhomeschooling, and unschooling just seemed impossible though I wanted <br/>\nto understand it and get out of my mind trap... I have been working for <br/>\nyears to let many personal issues go and just get some peace for <br/>\nmyself, and being aware of the kids as they are not how i want them to <br/>\nbe... a very wonderful change and the best time of my life really... <br/>\nbut what changed things very quickly and rather painlessly was to read <br/>\nthe posts and lurk around in this group... there were many arguments <br/>\nand back/ forth posts which I was really interested in due to the <br/>\nintensity of spirit and then the gentle release, to each her/ his <br/>\nown... I never had such articulate arguments or conversations about my <br/>\nthoughts on unschooling... I was trying to think in a giant mushy <br/>\ntangle, I could not get a clear thought, but still did not see how I <br/>\nwas having a tough time... listening to all the ideas here has been <br/>\npivotal for me, and I thought it was so great to go to the grocery <br/>\nstore and challenge myself to start something and not know how it would <br/>\nturn out, I found out that my kids can and will shop in a TIGHTLY <br/>\nCROWDED store on a Saturday, are happy getting in and out FAST, and <br/>\nsurprise, it was not as bad as I thought... really I believe this <br/>\nexperience came from losing the fear of the unknown, that I have too <br/>\nmany expectations to meet, they are wholly unnecessary and even if it&#39;s <br/>\nworse than I thought, we can go in and find a way to deal with it... <br/>\nthis is the problem I had with unschooling, thinking too much for the <br/>\nkids who are fine and not wanting to be analyzed and today it just <br/>\nvanished when we changed our minds...<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this makes sense, the ideas came on top of each other... thanks <br/>\nto all who participate and allow me to follow the thought process with <br/>\nyou, it&#39;s been such a great tool...<br/>\n<br/>\nJules.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20632,"nextTopicId":20623}}
