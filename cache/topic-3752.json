Some of you may not have seen this - but at the college where I <br/>\nteach they give a workshop in &quot;humor in the classroom&quot; (which is a GOOD thing <br/>\n- I&#39;m the queen of the bad puns during my lectures - so don&#39;t get me wrong, <br/>\nI&#39;m not opposed to laughter).

These are <br/>\nadult college students in these classes and it isn&#39;t really funny - they are <br/>\nmostly insulted. Maybe what I&#39;m complaining about is just that the attempt at <br/>\nhumor is stuck in so unnaturally -- when they get &quot;taught&quot; that they should <br/>\nuse humor in the classroom, they can&#39;t carry it off and it is just annoying.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12503,"nextTopicId":12505}}
