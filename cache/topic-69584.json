It is a book that tries to get people to try new experiences and learn about things just for the joy of it and, hopefully, to find interests that you are passionate about.  For example, under the DIY section  one of the activities is &quot;Unschool Yourself&quot;, and it actually has some great suggestions on how you can start to take control of your own learning even if you are a person who must attend school. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe book also has great activities/ideas like taking stuff apart to see how it works (faucets, dishwashers etc,), how to properly short-sheet a bed, decorating your room with spray paint and stencils (or not), how to make a horse out of timothy grass, lists of &quot;best ever&quot; for different book and film genres, making and downloading music, different ways to journal (visual, written, audio) etc.  It really has a very wide variety of things to offer.
