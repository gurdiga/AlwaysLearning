I hadn&#39;t remembered clearly. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what I wrote is useful for anyone&#39;s thinking, about unschooling discussions, or any discussions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sandra Dodd\t9:22am Feb 12<br/>\n&gt; (Someone) wrote &quot;Who gets to define what is unschooling.&quot; That is, internally, the question that most matches &quot;What about socialization?&quot; It&#39;s not a real question so much as it&#39;s antagonism. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For the purpose of this page, which was created and is solely administered by [the person who created it], it would be her definition.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (Someone else) wrote &quot;...why waste the energy seeking constant opposition?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If people think trying to keep a discussion on topic is &quot;seeking constant opposition,&quot; they&#39;ll waste a LOT of time in muddled, messy discussions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I believe I was added to this group by the owner when it was created. Others who have joined more recently are being pushy and rude to the experienced unschoolers who have the potential to discuss unschooling beneficially. I&#39;m going to leave this group but stay on the Radical Unchooling group, which is more peaceful with twice as many members, because I think &quot;more peaceful&quot; is important to anyone who is trying to move toward unschooling. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyone who isn&#39;t on that one and who does understand the purpose of staying on topic might want to join. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/groups/303347574750/\">http://www.facebook.com/groups/303347574750/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20223,"nextTopicId":67493}}
