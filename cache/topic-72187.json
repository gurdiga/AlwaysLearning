Ethan was visiting with a friend who has recently been introduced to Minecraft, and is very excited about it.  This friend was sharing *all* of his ideas with Ethan in a nonstop stream of dialogue.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, Ethan has done this with me many, many times.  There have been times when I&#39;ve needed to say to Ethan, &quot;Wow, man!  You have a lot of good ideas!  I need to take a bit of a break from listening so I can process some of them.&quot;  Usually, he says, &quot;Just one more!&quot; and shares one more before he or we move on to something else for a bit.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, because I know what it feels like to be on the receiving end of a lot of excited ideas all at once, I could see that Ethan was getting a bit overwhelmed with his friend&#39;s sharing.  Internally I chuckled a bit before I headed over to offer another ear for the excited friend.  That made some room for Ethan to have a bit of a break.  Then the conversation moved toward more of a two way communication.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater that night I said to Ethan, &quot;[Friend] sure was excited to share his ideas with you today.&quot;  Ethan said &quot;Yeah!  I just couldn&#39;t listen to it all!&quot;  I said &quot;I understand.&quot;  Again, inside, I chuckled a bit.  He&#39;s figuring it out.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that Ethan is ten, I don&#39;t spend as much time with him and his friends as I did when he was younger.  I often do play with them all, but they like to do their own thing too.  But, regardless of whether I&#39;m playing with them or not, I do still keep within earshot so that I can offer help when I feel like help might be appreciated. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ok to talk about friend A to friend B the way she was doing.

I feel good when I hear him sharing with others - good things and difficulties.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I share a struggle I&#39;m having with someone, I&#39;m usually looking for feedback to help me better navigate a particular relationship, or else I&#39;m trying (probably awkwardly) to establish personal boundaries for myself through example.  In either case I&#39;m hoping the person I&#39;m sharing with will trust that I have no ill intent.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTrust that your daughter is not sharing her feelings with her friend from a place of mean spiritedness.  Maybe the experience *was* horrible for her.  See if you can help her have it not be so horrible next time.  Before the friend comes over again, maybe ask your daughter for suggestions on how you can help her have a more enjoyable time with her friend.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] RE: Talking about people behind their backs","postDate":"1379691888","msgId":72197,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE2QUJCRDJGLTkyQjYtNEVFQS04MjlGLUE5RjZERUNGNzkyN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGwxaDZncCsxNzAyODIyQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGwxaDZncCsxNzAyODIyQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":72196,"nextInTopic":72199,"prevInTime":72196,"nextInTime":72198,"topicId":72187,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I do think that book can be useful, and I do think the mom should not judge so harshly a child venting, and it would be good if the child could vent to the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-599585232\"><html><head></head>I do think that book can be useful, and I do think the mom should not judge so harshly a child venting, and it would be good if the child could vent to the mom. &nbsp;That, I agree with.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>This, though, seems too scripted, too pushy, too much putting negative ideas in her head that might not have been there.</div><div><br></div><div>---------</div><div><p style=\"line-height:15px;margin:0px 0px 1em;font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;\">&quot;So, J talked and talked all day, huh?&quot;&nbsp;<br style=\"line-height:1.22em;\"></p><p style=\"line-height:15px;margin:0px 0px 1em;font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;\">&quot;Did you feel like you couldn&#39;t get a word in?&quot;</p><p style=\"line-height:15px;margin:0px 0px 1em;font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;\">&quot;Hmmmm....&quot;</p><p style=\"line-height:15px;margin:0px 0px 1em;font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;\">&quot;You just weren&#39;t interested.&quot;</p><p style=\"line-height:15px;margin:0px 0px 1em;font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;\">&quot;Yeah....&quot;</p><p style=\"line-height:15px;margin:0px 0px 1em;font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;\">&quot;You wanted some peace and quiet.&quot;</p><div>______________</div></div><div><br></div><div>Too much projection, I think, and interpretation. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Sandra</div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Talking about people behind their backs","postDate":"1379690437","msgId":72196,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI1NzkwRTI3LTk3MkEtNDFENy1BOTA1LTFCMUY5RjI4RTU0QkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGwxZmd2YisxMGppbm1rQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGwxZmd2YisxMGppbm1rQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":72194,"nextInTopic":72197,"prevInTime":72195,"nextInTime":72197,"topicId":72187,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Men learn by doing things and watching other people do","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-139392818\">There is a prejudice in our culture against women&#39;s ways of being and learning, and toward that of men.<br/>\n<br/>\nMen learn by doing things and watching other people do them.  They learn to build houses and hunt and all kinds of things that way, in a very natural way.  Some women do too, but it&#39;s predominantly the way men hang out with other men and learn to row a boat or tie a knot or fish.<br/>\n<br/>\nWomen tell stories to each other.  They talk about cooking and childbirth and about human interactions.  Social &quot;niceties&quot; are what women have been responsible for in most families in most societies related to the English-speaking world. There might be some exceptions, but they&#39;re not in the realm of thank-you notes and party decorations, remembering the birthdays of girlfriends of sons, and buying and wrapping gifts (while knowing what sort of gift is appropriate for what occasion, and how much to spend based on how close the relationship or friendship is, and balanced against how wealthy the main gift giver(s) will be so you don&#39;t make them look bad by spending too much.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s all tied in with religion and fears, but &quot;gossip&quot; has been considered a sin for a few hundred years, and was especially villified, I think, by the Puritans.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone dies, other people related to that person, or friends with that person, need to know.  Not in a sensationalist way, but in such a way that others will not be insensitive.  But that can&#39;t be done without talking behind their backs.   Ditto all kinds of other life changes—birth, marriage, divorce.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone does something very nice for you, it&#39;s not a bad thing to tell all your friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just had the same two electricians to my house for the second time.  I love these guys!  I might go online and give them a nice review, but that will be behind their backs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is why I&#39;m asking.  To use a phrase like &quot;talking about people behind their backs&quot; is to quote someone else.  It&#39;s to make a vague yet sweeping negative appraisal of something... vague.<br/>\n<br/>\nWomen, especially, talk to each other.  Some men are that way, too.  My friend Jeff knows and remembers every little bit of relationship or friendship anyone he knows ever had and is a good protocol advisor because he knows who needs/wants/knows/expects what, and which other peoples&#39; presence might make things awkward.  He uses his power for good.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I think the important thing is whether there is malice, or whether it&#39;s conversational.  People have the right to talk about their own lives, and other people are a part of our lives.  If I were to tell you lots of stories about these electricians, would it be gossip or me telling something interesting I learned from and about a nice couple of men?<br/>\n<br/>\nGo easy about condemning something with a phrase that came to you whole.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/phrases\">http://sandradodd.com/phrases</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I don&#39;t like is when people tell lies about other people.

More often it didn&#39;t go far, \nbut usually it seemed like she understood my point. (Sandra asked about what&#39;s wrong with this kind of talk -- to me, what&#39;s wrong with it is that it doesn&#39;t foster trust among friends, and it can hurt feelings and harm friendships if the trash talk gets back around to the person it&#39;s about -- which it often did when I was that age. I&#39;m wary of getting close to people who bad-mouth others, because often it isn&#39;t an isolated occurrence.)<br><br>And I might \nalso say, maybe at a different time to avoid saying too much at once and\n making it all sound like parental blah-blah-blah, &quot;I wish I&#39;d known you\n were feeling so frustrated with J.
