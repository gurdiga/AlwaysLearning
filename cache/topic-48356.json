We had a stack of mail--junk mail, bills, and misc. all piled so I could go through it later. She started making letters out of them (A, E, V, X, W, etc.), and then she got so excited to see how many letters she could make in a row with the mail at hand that she was literally giddy with delight. Once she had her rows of letters down, she started making words, and then started pulling all sorts of other objects out to make the words too: spoons, pencils, pens, Halloween witches, and a stapler. It was too much fun and we were all laughing at her creative spark!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48281,"nextTopicId":48247}}
