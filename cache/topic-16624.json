A<br/>\nspecial Eye on America investigation only on Monday&#39;s CBS Evening<br/>\nNews.&quot;--  CBS News website, 10/12/03 <br/>\n <br/>\nOn Monday and Tuesday of this week (October 13 and 14), CBS News plans to<br/>\nbroadcast a two-part report which attempts to link homeschooling with<br/>\nchild abuse and homicide.  See the website at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/08/01/eveningnews/main15214.shtml\">http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/08/01/eveningnews/main15214.shtml</a><br/>\n <br/>\nCBS News recently sent a team from Los Angeles to Raleigh and Smithfield,<br/>\nN.C., to gather footage concerning a murder-suicide which occurred two<br/>\nyears ago in a formerly homeschooling family.  In the July 2001 incident,<br/>\n14-year-old Brandon Keith Warren shot and killed two teenaged siblings<br/>\nand then himself.  The family had been homeschooling at one time but<br/>\nprior to the event had dropped out of compliance with state law and were<br/>\npresumed truant.  Social Services had been in contact with the family on<br/>\nnumerous occasions, but charges of child abuse against the parents were<br/>\ndismissed in the trial that followed the murders.<br/>\n <br/>\nAlthough the producer has assured NCHE there is no attempt to portray<br/>\nthis as typical of home educators, CBS repeatedly asked NCHE President<br/>\nHal Young whether inadequate government oversight contributed to the<br/>\ntragedy, and whether increased levels of regulation and home inspection<br/>\n-- extended to all homeschool families -- could prevent such tragedies in<br/>\nthe future.  Since the family in question was already in violation of the<br/>\nhomeschool statute and was well known to local Social Services, there is<br/>\nno reason to expect a stricter homeschooling law would have made a<br/>\ndifference.<br/>\n <br/>\nNCHE&#39;s reply has always been that this tragedy was not a result of<br/>\neducational choice.  Subjecting over 28,000 North Carolina families to<br/>\nadditional government scrutiny, paperwork and intrusion would neither<br/>\nimprove education nor prevent such a rare and unexpected crime.  Our<br/>\nprevious response to this suggestion in government circles is posted at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hslda.org/docs/news/hslda/200206060.asp\">http://www.hslda.org/docs/news/hslda/200206060.asp</a><br/>\n <br/>\nThe 100,000-plus homeschooling parents and students in our state are<br/>\ncontinuing to prove that home education is an effective means of<br/>\nproducing intelligent, sociable graduates, well-prepared for adult life. <br/>\nIn short, a remarkable tragedy in a single dysfunctional family does not<br/>\nmake a case for more restrictive homeschool laws.<br/>\n <br/>\nNCHE is concerned that such a sensational report will encourage a<br/>\nsuspicious view of homeschoolers and consideration of regulatory issues<br/>\nbased on a false premise.    Homeschoolers may wish to monitor these<br/>\nreports and consider their own response to neighbors, co-workers, or<br/>\nfamily members in the days ahead.  NCHE will issue a public response<br/>\nafter the report specifics are shown.   <br/>\n <br/>\nContact Information:<br/>\n <br/>\nNorth Carolinians for Home Education:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nche.com\">http://nche.com</a> -- (919) 790-1100<br/>\n <br/>\nCBS Evening News -- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:evening@...\">evening@...</a><br/>\n ~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\nDar</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":132859234,"authorName":"Paula Sjogerman","from":"Paula Sjogerman &lt;sjogy@...&gt;","profile":"psjogy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] homeschooling........","postDate":"1066067208","msgId":16628,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJCQjA0RjM4LjNBOTAlc2pvZ3lAc2JjZ2xvYmFsLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJCQjAyMDJFLjM2NUM1JWlrb25zdGl0Y2hlckBjb3gubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":16627,"nextInTopic":16630,"prevInTime":16627,"nextInTime":16629,"topicId":16624,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"OK, duh, I clearly didn t read Nancy s post to the end.

I mean, think about some of the<br/>\nnegative &quot;homeschooling&quot; stories of the past: the Randy Weaver family were<br/>\n&quot;homeschoolers&quot;; so was Andrea Yates, who drowned her five children.  News<br/>\nagencies write stories to get people to consume their particular media<br/>\nproduct.
