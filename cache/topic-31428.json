Some allergies are too serious to ignore.<br/>\nIf the inside of my dds mouth starts to itch I have less than 10<br/>\nminutes before full blown anaphylaxis sets in. We carry emergency<br/>\nadrenaline at all times. This gives us time to get to the hospital. If<br/>\nwe do not inject within minutes of contact to an allergen she will<br/>\ndie. Children (and adults) can die of anaphylaxis within 30 minutes of<br/>\ncontact to an allergen. I have nearly lost her more than once.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe may never have an anaphylatic reaction, but itching inside the<br/>\nmouth or throat is such a biggie that you have scared me.
