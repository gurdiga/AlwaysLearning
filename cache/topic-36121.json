I agree.  I think so much of the fun is sapped out of things when there&#39;s a hidden <br/>\nagena--or I guess not always &quot;hidden&quot;--but so often with homeschooling families, it <br/>\nseems like there is this sneaky kind of &quot;Mom&#39;s pulling one over on them and it&#39;s actually <br/>\neducational&quot; kind of attitude.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I don&#39;t mean that I think things can&#39;t be done for the sake of their educational value, <br/>\nbut it&#39;s the sneaky vibe that&#39;s been buggin&#39; me lately.  For instance, we checked out a <br/>\ngame that was created for learning multiplication.  There is nothing hidden about the <br/>\nagenda.  I asked my son, who enjoys thinking about numbers and patterns, if he&#39;d like to <br/>\ntry this game that could be a fun way of learning the multiplication tables.  I didn&#39;t sidle <br/>\nup to him and ask innocently if he&#39;d like to try this new game--you know the attitude I <br/>\nmean.  It was all simple and straight-up.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I&#39;ve definitely been in on the other kind of conversation in which the moms are <br/>\ncomparing notes about what their children learned that they didn&#39;t know they were <br/>\nlearning with a conspiratorial attitude.  Blech!!  It just feels disrespectful and <br/>\ncondescending to me.  I guess that&#39;s what got triggered for me with the project post.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; **************Gas prices getting you down?
