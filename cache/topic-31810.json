Breaking down this history into six &quot;modes&quot; the first chapter is &quot;the infanticidal mode&quot; and mentions that &quot; Ancient Roman parents were not legally required to keep any of their children. The law upheld and safeguarded fathers&#39; absolute authority, explicitly including the right to execute their own children.&quot;  Pretty grim stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother interesting point from a legal point of view, from the book...&quot;In 1969, the United States Supreme Court declared children to be &#39;persons&#39; under the United States Constitution. Up until then, American children had been legally the property of their parents.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother section examines &quot;how child-rearing forged the destiny of nations&quot; and details the parenting mores of the childhoods of dictators such as Hitler and Stalin.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThankfully the book goes on to detail the emerging parenting mode, &quot;the helping mode&quot;, which i&#39;d consider unschooling to be forging the way in. It&#39;s the next step in the ongoing evolution of human life.

It isn&#39;t just children. But there is some very interesting anthropological discussions on the inclusion of children and the caretaking of children. Barry Hewlett, who is at Washington State University, worked with the Aka and found that the fathers do 47% of childcare, and even suckle infants (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/parents/story/0,,1506843,00.html)\">http://www.guardian.co.uk/parents/story/0,,1506843,00.html)</a>. Paul Turke found that having the first child be a girl increased the number of children that a household had amongst the islanders of Ifaluk. Karen Kramer did an interesting piece of work on the changing dynamics of a family work and structure among a group of Maya in Mexico (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tiny.cc/eQqan)\">http://tiny.cc/eQqan)</a>, in her conclusion section she talks about Jim Boone&#39;s and Karen Keckler&#39;s (my old roommate) work on how there probably wasn&#39;t constant high mortality risks to children, instead there were sudden population crashes due to disease or natural disaster<br/>\n that kept human population numbers down. Barry Hewlett did an interesting comparison on maternal care across groups including, I believe, the U.S. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.vancouver.wsu.edu/fac/hewlett/infantcare.html\">http://www.vancouver.wsu.edu/fac/hewlett/infantcare.html</a> is a sort of review of other cultures as compared with the U.S. I can&#39;t find the paper with holding time. It might not actually be a paper, David referenced it in a paper he was writing and it might be personal communication as opposed to something citable. One of my favorite books, my cleansing book after trying to read Leidloff, is Meredith Small&#39;s book Our babies, Ourselves which is a nice review of the literature on infant care. She has a later book on older children which I got David for Christmas and I haven&#39;t done more than peruse the stuff on children and stress. <br/>\n<br/>\nParenting is hard and it takes time, a fact that means that parenting is in direct conflict with other things that we might want or need to do. It can be less of a time burden when you can find others to care for your children, daycare workers, sisters, older children, fathers, grandmothers, whomever. In the U.S. and the U.K. where parents are often both working outside the home it becomes very difficult to care for your child in a way that doesn&#39;t produce conflict and punishment and separate beds and separate lives and fewer children.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269526657,"authorName":"Lara Miller","from":"Lara Miller &lt;birthmamma@...&gt;","profile":"birthmamma2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: A new hello....","postDate":"1200885144","msgId":31825,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYzMDc0NzIzLUU3NzAtNEE4NC05Mzc0LTY5NzcwMzg2QzY5NUBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDZGQTBERUIxLUY5M0YtNDUxMC1CMjU2LUE0MDg4MjM0MEZDMEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGZtdnY2aytvaWdkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MEY2QkY1NzgtOTczQS00MEZCLUI5OUUtNDY0RkU1MjQyRjZCQG1hYy5jb20+IDw2RkEwREVCMS1GOTNGLTQ1MTAtQjI1Ni1BNDA4ODIzNDBGQzBAc2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":31824,"nextInTopic":31826,"prevInTime":31824,"nextInTime":31826,"topicId":31810,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"No, I don t want to press her, I just found it interesting her reasoning.

I&#39;m learning to slow my brain down and see<br/>\nwhat I&#39;m really looking at. I don&#39;t know if I can explain it.. It&#39;s<br/>\nlike being really present with my life and my kid. Enjoying all the<br/>\nsmall details that are normally looked over because of some unspoken<br/>\ngoal-minded thinking. <br/>\n<br/>\nI read in your post that you are a birthing/doula person. I think that<br/>\nthe propaganda around schooling in our country is similar to me to the<br/>\npropaganda around birthing. It&#39;s so pervasive that most of our current<br/>\nsociety cannot think how either of those are done without the<br/>\nassistance of experts, but also it colors the thinking around those 2<br/>\nsubjects in broad ways. <br/>\nThere are definite moments when someone with specific knowledge is<br/>\nneeded (and I&#39;m very grateful for the medical advances that helped me<br/>\nsurvive when I was born), but through schooling we have been trained<br/>\nto be so powerless and not trust ourselves. It&#39;s no surprise to me<br/>\nthat the trend to have hospital births came after compulsory schooling<br/>\nhad it&#39;s effect on a few generations.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m starting to see in myself patterns of thinking that are so related<br/>\nto school! Not even schooly subjects or education-y things! More like<br/>\nstuff related to respecting my child as an individual. Or what is<br/>\nhonestly supportive and loving this other person standing in front of<br/>\nme. No matter what his age. It&#39;s just kind of interesting. In that<br/>\nway, unschooling works in relating with my partner (and myself) in a<br/>\nreally nice way.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, I have to go again.

We are newer to homeschooling which  <br/>\nvery quickly turned into unschooling.  The older two kids went to a  <br/>\nhyped-up, over-achieving elementary school for a few years which  <br/>\ndrove me totally crazy.  I think I have always been an unschooling  <br/>\nmom, I just didn&#39;t realize this was possible let alone be able find  <br/>\nmy way to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have always been outside of the box thinkers (or contrarians as my  <br/>\nmom says :)  and last year we decided to really change things up.  We  <br/>\ngot rid of our house and most of our things and moved into a  <br/>\nmotorhome, took off and haven&#39;t looked back.  We have traveled all  <br/>\nthe way from NC to Alaska and everywhere in-between.  Right now, we  <br/>\nare thinking that we might (just might) think of settling back down  <br/>\nthis fall maybe in Boulder, CO or close to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the unschooling goes, we have needed quite a bit of  <br/>\ndeschooling.  Especially the oldest.  He was in a high stress,  <br/>\nadvanced class that all seems so ridiculous now that we have found  <br/>\nanother way.  I think that I need the most deschooling though and I  <br/>\nstill have a long way to go!  I am working hard on not comparing my  <br/>\nkids to others.  Especially the last month since we have been staying  <br/>\nnear family with same-age kids in school.  Dh&#39;s family really puts a  <br/>\nbig value on education and has lots of questions for me.  I find it  <br/>\nreally hard to explain exactly what we are doing and why.  All I know  <br/>\nis that no matter how I think on it, it just feels right in my heart,  <br/>\neven when it doesn&#39;t feel so right in my schooled brain (or anyone  <br/>\nelse&#39;s brain).  As with most decisions in my life, I must go with my  <br/>\nheart.  We haven&#39;t been without struggle.  My kids have patiently  <br/>\nbided my monthly &quot;OMG I&#39;m not doing the right thing!&quot; meltdown and  <br/>\nthen we get to take one step back and then proceed with the two steps  <br/>\nforward into building back up the trust.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have some, ahem, control issues.  Especially around food.  I  <br/>\nsuppose I am a bit of a health food nut and I have had the hardest  <br/>\ntime in letting go of that and watching the kids eat what I consider  <br/>\n(emphasis on I) total crap.  I am also still struggling with trying  <br/>\nto get places.  I feel like every outing results in some sort of  <br/>\nbattle of wills with at least one of them or me.  I am sure I will be  <br/>\nasking lots of questions and I am already reading lots around here  <br/>\nand on Sandra&#39;s site - what a wealth of information.  I feel like all  <br/>\nof the families quotes and stories there are little pats on my back  <br/>\nreassuring me we are doing great.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read somewhere on one of the pages where the mom said she got tired  <br/>\nof people looking at her with sad or sympathetic eyes when she said  <br/>\nshe homeschooled.  That drives me crazy too!  I get it all the time.   <br/>\n&quot;Oh wow, you home school?  I could never do that&quot;  &quot;more power to ya&quot;  <br/>\n&quot;you must be brave&quot; and on and on.  I find it a privilege to be with  <br/>\nmy kids all the time and watch them and myself blossom.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout myself?  I am a Bradley childbirth instructor, birth and  <br/>\npostpartum doula and one of these days, a midwife.  Of course, all of  <br/>\nthat is on hold while we are traveling, but other than my kids, birth  <br/>\nis my true great passion.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly - I think we are planning on going to the HENA conference in  <br/>\nPhoenix area March 1-2.
