The pastor, Bobby Burnett,<br/>\nwas a pianist who had traveled the country teaching music before he became a<br/>\npastor.  He was a big influence on the Gaithers (as in singer/songwriter<br/>\nBill Gaither and his siblings, for anyone who knows southern gospel music)<br/>\nwhen they were young.  Videt Polk was a deacon in the church, and he<br/>\ncompiled church hymnals for Zondervan and other publishers, as well as being<br/>\nan owner of Stamps-Baxter publishing.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne family in the church made a living as a touring gospel act, traveling to<br/>\nchurches and performing in exchange for &quot;love offerings&quot;...whatever people<br/>\ndropped in the plate.  Their daughter was their pianist, and they sang<br/>\n4-part harmonies beautifully.  The daughter got married, eloped,<br/>\ndisappeared.

He learned/played/practiced<br/>\nfor 10 to 12 hours a day for 2 or 3 weeks straight (I&#39;m guessing this was<br/>\nsummertime, because they were homeschoolers but not unschoolers) and he was<br/>\nconcert-ready, not only as an accompanist but even playing cool solos and<br/>\nbridges.

All this with no pressure.<br/>\n <br/>\nAt some point, I began looking into piano teaching styles and what is in our area, in case my son wanted to take lessons. There was one teacher offering the Suzuki method, which starts with learning by ear rather than learning by sight-reading, and seems to be one of the best options to me. She was about an hour away, but my son was interested enough to want to visit the teacher for a mini-intro lessons (like 10 minutes long) and then, also, visit a friend after, so it wasn&#39;t just a long piano lesson car ride.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe ended up not doing the lessons there. My son didn&#39;t have the interest at the time, it didn&#39;t click totally with the teacher (though she was nice), and it seemed far for us to drive once a week as well.<br/>\n <br/>\nAbout a year later, I happened to come across a Suzuki teacher in our area. I passed the info onto my son&#39;s friends (the piano player) who wanted to take lessons, and she started lessons with her (the lessons are 15 mins to start) and liked it. After a few months, I made an appt with this piano teacher to come tune our piano and, at the same time, offer an intro lesson to my son. Things clicked, my son became interested in learning more, and we signed up for lessons. It&#39;s been about a month now, and though my son isn&#39;t totally over the moon about the piano, he likes it and is interested in it, and is progressing at his own level.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe piano teacher is very nice, and she said part of the whole Suzuki lessons is that I need to be present so that I see what they do in a lesson and so I can do it with him at home after. I found that to be great, since my son would insist I be in the room anyways! <br/>\n <br/>\nThere are certain things to practice every week, and sometimes my son will practice, sometimes he won&#39;t. I encourage it and will practice with him (most especially when I am feeling excited and super-positive about it!), but if I sense resistance, I drop any suggestion of practicing, b/c I know it wil lead him to dislike piano. I&#39;m not here to create a piano meistro - I only hope to be able to share with him the joy of being able to play. <br/>\n <br/>\nI did have to explain to our piano teacher the second week of lessons that I wasn&#39;t going to make him practice, and that he loves to play with her and catches on quickly when she shows him but that he might not want to repeat it at home. And if the only time he plays in a week is with her, that&#39;s OK with me, just go at his pace. So was totally in agreement with that, and also said she&#39;d be happy to stray from the usual &#39;curriculum&#39; and teach him songs he&#39;s interested in learning. <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m guessing at some point my son will learn just enough that he will suddenly want to learn a TON and will practice of his own desire, or he may want to play more and more with his friend, or he could drop it all together. I&#39;m open to any scenario, and will happily keep playing myself all the while, because I enjoy it so much.<br/>\n <br/>\nHope this helps you have an idea of how we have unschooled our piano lessons.<br/>\n <br/>\n- Ariana<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://windowslive.com/explore?ocid=TXT_TAGLM_WL_t2_allup_explore_022009\">http://windowslive.com/explore?ocid=TXT_TAGLM_WL_t2_allup_explore_022009</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":157311507,"authorName":"eaglefalconlark","from":"&quot;eaglefalconlark&quot; &lt;eaglefalconlark@...&gt;","profile":"eaglefalconlark","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: hm!","postDate":"1233723258","msgId":41739,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdtYjcxcStlNm0yQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdtYWx1NytlcW5vQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41736,"nextInTopic":41743,"prevInTime":41738,"nextInTime":41740,"topicId":41727,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... need to have lessons???","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-372138079\">--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;m_aduhene&quot; &lt;m_aduhene@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;well u all know what i am going to ask, but here goes......do they<br/>\n </span></blockquote>need to have lessons???&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m assuming you mean that they want to play, and you&#39;re wondering if<br/>\nthey need to be trained by a professional in order to be able to? <br/>\n<br/>\nThey don&#39;t. They might want to if they are looking for musical<br/>\ncommunity (a teacher can make a good &#39;in&#39;) and like to learn by being<br/>\nshown and by having some human interaction and encouragement. But it&#39;s<br/>\nnot necessary in order to learn.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve played piano since I was 6, and took lessons for 12 years, and<br/>\nalthough I would certainly get my kids lessons if they wanted them, my<br/>\npreference is that they don&#39;t have them, actually. I feel (and this<br/>\napplies to everything I care about that I was schooled in) that I<br/>\nbecame disabled in some ways by an early emphasis on practice and<br/>\ntechnique, in that my intuitive feel for it and what I felt naturally<br/>\ndrawn to do with it got buried. I&#39;ve been so thrilled to see my kids<br/>\ngo from banging on the piano to picking out tunes they&#39;ve heard in<br/>\nmovies or video games, to creating their own (really lovely)<br/>\ncompositions. This more organic progression was something that I never<br/>\ngot to experience, and I regret that. Their relationship with the<br/>\ninstrument is much different than mine was at their age. My<br/>\nrelationship with it has changed since I&#39;ve been deschooling, but it&#39;s<br/>\nstill not (and I don&#39;t know if it will ever be) at the place where<br/>\ntheirs is at. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey have more recently asked me to show them how to read notation (at<br/>\nthis point they can read and do research so could learn in any number<br/>\nof ways, but I guess it&#39;s just most convenient to ask me.) A person<br/>\nwon&#39;t ask unless they&#39;re particularly interested in that aspect of it<br/>\n(unless of course they&#39;ve been led to believe they have to have it to<br/>\nplay) and if they&#39;re interested, they&#39;re ready because they&#39;ve gotten<br/>\nwhat they need to out of approaching it in a more intuitive way first. <br/>\n<br/>\nLinda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] hm!","postDate":"1233720454","msgId":41735,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM4NzgwNy4xNDkzNS5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwOC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGdtYWx1NytlcW5vQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41732,"nextInTopic":41736,"prevInTime":41734,"nextInTime":41736,"topicId":41727,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Here is a video ofÂ two unscooled kid that playng piano . http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PExmO7hAbM http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiZ58E-Gu_E ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1976477538\">Here is a video ofÂ two unscooled kid that playng piano .<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PExmO7hAbM\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PExmO7hAbM</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiZ58E-Gu_E\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiZ58E-Gu_E</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTGO8Olpkck\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTGO8Olpkck</a><br/>\nÂ <br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://polykow.blogspot.com/\">http://polykow.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[{"url":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/_PExmO7hAbM?wmode=opaque","type":"VIDEO"},{"url":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/RiZ58E-Gu_E?wmode=opaque","type":"VIDEO"},{"url":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/hTGO8Olpkck?wmode=opaque","type":"VIDEO"}]},{"userId":279376612,"authorName":"Laura Beaudin","from":"Laura Beaudin &lt;laura.beaudin@...&gt;","profile":"ilhamdolilah","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] hm!","postDate":"1233720275","msgId":41736,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ5ODkxM2Q3LjA2MmE0MDBhLjEzZDEuZmZmZmE0MDlAbXguZ29vZ2xlLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdtYWx1NytlcW5vQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdtYWx1NytlcW5vQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41735,"nextInTopic":41739,"prevInTime":41735,"nextInTime":41737,"topicId":41727,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Perhaps ask them if they WANT lessons?
