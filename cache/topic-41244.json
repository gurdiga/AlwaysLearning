Grab your swimsuit and a pair of flip flops and join Not Back To School <br/>\nCamp advisors, Blake Boles and Abbi Miller, for a healthful and challenging experience of a <br/>\nlifetime. The theme of this trip is &quot;Health is Wealth&quot;: learning how to care for your body. <br/>\nStudents will learn to plan and prepare nutritious meals, keep their bodies active and <br/>\nhealthy, and experience a full month of overall mind-body wellness. Other activities <br/>\ninclude biking, hiking, daily yoga on the beach, and possibly surfing & windsurfing <br/>\nlessons. You&#39;ll also get the chance to experience authentic Hawaiian culture, complete the <br/>\nworld&#39;s longest down-hill bike ride (down a volcano!), devour fresh coconuts and papayas, <br/>\nand discover lush tropical beaches!  The trip will consist of 10-12 students, ages 15-19 <br/>\n(flexible), and two trip leaders. The group will stay in a rented house near the town of Paia <br/>\nfor the duration of the course.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe total program fee is $3,999, which includes lodging, activities, transportation in Maui, <br/>\nand all-you-can-eat delicious & healthful food.  Students are responsible for covering <br/>\npersonal incidentals, traveler&#39;s insurance, and roundtrip airfare to Maui.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo view the full details of the trip and to learn how to apply, please visit our website: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooladventures.com\">http://www.unschooladventures.com</a><br/>\nEnrollment begins January 1, 2009.
