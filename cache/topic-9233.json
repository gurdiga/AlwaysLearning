I&#39;d unsubscribed for a<br/>\nwhile as DH was laid off and took over with the kids while I worked from<br/>\nhome full time.  He just went back to work and I must say I missed the<br/>\nflow that I&#39;d got into with the kids.  I&#39;m listening to my husband as I<br/>\nwrite giving short sharp controlling directions to both kidlets about<br/>\nnot spilling water on the floor of the bathroom (is that possible?) not<br/>\ntoo much water, not too many bubbles.... DH just found all the shampoo<br/>\ntipped out and asked me to go take away money from Zak (assuming it was<br/>\nhim)... I answered &quot;no... I don&#39;t think I want to be that<br/>\ncontrolling&quot;.... I think I&#39;ve noticed that not only is he controlling,<br/>\nbut I am as well since I haven&#39;t been the one &quot;at home&quot; with them.  DH<br/>\nwent to work this morning and we had a great few hours.  The kids were<br/>\nnaked building tents in the living room out of sheets and other things<br/>\nthey could find.  I was cleaning my house (we are moving) and would stop<br/>\nand play periodically as I was invited into their tents.  Eventually I<br/>\nwas invited in and told the rules of what happens if you leave the tent<br/>\nand how many points you lose.  I decided to stay and lay on the couch<br/>\nand read Life Learning Magazine... It was actually quite peaceful...<br/>\nPrior to that they were outside naked turning on the hose and making a<br/>\ntrench and a bowling place....  Covered with mud I put them in the bath<br/>\nprior to them building tents.  I think I&#39;m going to think more about<br/>\nthis controlling issue as I used to like to say &quot;is this the hill I want<br/>\nto die on&quot;....<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\nTucson, AZ</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9257,"nextTopicId":9253}}
