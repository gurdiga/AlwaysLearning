I don&#39;t think it can be emphasized enough.  <br/>\nAnd it applies at all ages. No matter HOW trivial what they are doing  <br/>\nseems to be, to a parent, take it seriously. If a kid is spending  <br/>\nmany hours a day watching soap operas, take it seriously. Start  <br/>\nwatching together - subscribe to Soap Opera Digest. Bring up the  <br/>\ncharacters in your conversations. Bring up the situations and compare  <br/>\nthem to real situations happening in the world to real people. And,  <br/>\nnotice what it is that seems interesting about the soaps, to your  <br/>\nkid. Is it relaxing? Is it exciting? Is it the relationships or the  <br/>\ndrama or the tragedy that is attractive? What is holding his/her  <br/>\ninterest?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I picked soaps because most parents would probably think their kid  <br/>\nwas wasting his/her time if he watched soaps for hours and hours  <br/>\nevery day. But, replace &quot;soap operas&quot; with anything else - whatever a  <br/>\nkid might be spending their time on.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Attention must be paid.&quot; (from Death of a Salesman)<br/>\n<br/>\nAn unschooling parent needs to be fully present with their kids,  <br/>\nsensitive to their kids&#39; needs, and extremely respectful of their  <br/>\nkids&#39; interests. This is simple and very difficult, at the same time.  <br/>\nIt is so simple, it really asks so little of us, as parents, to pay  <br/>\nattention to what &quot;is&quot; right in front of us. But, it is very very  <br/>\ndifficult to do, sometimes, especially when what our kids are  <br/>\npresenting to us appears to us to be negative or dull or unproductive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI work at it, still, myself, sometimes. My 16 and 19 year olds have  <br/>\nbeen playing The SIMS for hours and hours, every day for a week.  <br/>\nThey&#39;ve been up until 3 or 4 in the morning playing and slept until 1  <br/>\nor 2 in the afternoon.  This is hard for me - I have a little urge  <br/>\ninside myself to try to get them to do something more productive.  <br/>\nHaving been down this road many times before, though, I stifled that  <br/>\nurge in myself and purposely thought supportive thoughts (they are  <br/>\nhaving so much fun with this, they are having fun TOGETHER and  <br/>\nenjoying a lot of hours of side-by-side play, a lot like when they  <br/>\nwere little). And then, suddenly, a moment of clarity struck me - my  <br/>\nolder daughter left last week for Alaska - she&#39;ll be gone for 3 or 4  <br/>\nmonths and most likely will not ever really live at home again. My  <br/>\nother girls&#39; response has been to nestle down in the house and play  <br/>\ntogether - play something that involves creating and controlling  <br/>\nfamilies&#39; lives (The SIMS). DUH!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - I got serious about supporting their play time - just by doing  <br/>\nlittle things like helping them find a missing disk and bringing them  <br/>\nsome food and giving them a little kiss as I walked by, etc. MY  <br/>\nrealization is what changed - not their behavior - but it changed the  <br/>\nentire feeling of our home - in a flash!<br/>\n<br/>\nNext thing I knew, Rosie was writing a screenplay (NaNoWriMo is  <br/>\nsponsoring a screenplay writing month) and she&#39;s using the SIMS to  <br/>\ndevelop the characters and putting them into some kind of storyboard  <br/>\nsoftware that Roxana found for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kid who was upset that his mom put his straw in his milk box?  <br/>\nPaying more attention might show a series of situations like this one  <br/>\n- he probably is reacting to being treated just like the other kids -  <br/>\nit probably felt sort of like being part of an assembly-line. It  <br/>\nwould probably help to single him out more, in advance, and  <br/>\nconstantly ask him things like, &quot;I&#39;m putting the straws in for the  <br/>\nlittle ones, do you want to do yours, yourself?&quot; Take every  <br/>\nopportunity to treat him as different and special.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is that you don&#39;t have to have the insight in advance. You  <br/>\ndon&#39;t always have to have the knowledge of what the kid is going  <br/>\nthrough, what need they are trying to fill. You won&#39;t always know.  <br/>\nBut if you pay close attention and take on face value what they&#39;re  <br/>\nshowing you, and take it seriously whether or not you understand it,  <br/>\nyou&#39;ll often get more insight, sometimes only after-the-fact.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the post about the kid being upset about mom putting his straw in  <br/>\nhis milk box for him, it was implied that his reason for &quot;wigging  <br/>\nout&quot; was trivial. I think it was supposed to indicate to us that the  <br/>\nkid is having meltdowns over such little things.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of considering these little things, consider that they are  <br/>\nimportant and significant enough for a child to be really upset by  <br/>\nit, enough to disrupt an otherwise fun outing. This is not a trivial  <br/>\nmatter, this is a matter that is serious to this child and, if it is  <br/>\nimportant to the child than mom ought to take it very seriously, as  <br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs we get older and our kids grow up, we eventually come to realize  <br/>\nthat all the big things in our lives are really the direct result of  <br/>\nhow we&#39;ve handled all the little things.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people have several young children, they can often get into a  <br/>\nsort of mass production, assembly line, mode of operation. In a mall,  <br/>\nmom can be focused on getting food into the hands of each of the  <br/>\nkids, for example, while making sure none of them are wandering away.  <br/>\nEasy to not be aware of how one of the kids might be not comfortable  <br/>\nwith the assembly-line approach until the kid explodes over some  <br/>\nseemingly trivial thing like mom sticking his straw in his milk  <br/>\ncarton for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake more time to pay more attention. &quot;Sweat the small stuff.&quot; &lt;G&gt;  <br/>\nSlow down a lot. Time the extra minutes to check whether or not each  <br/>\nkid is comfortable in the car. Check whether each kid is getting the  <br/>\nfood they really want. Check - &quot;Do you want a straw? Want me to put  <br/>\nit in?&quot; Take the time to focus on little things like this and the big  <br/>\nthings will be good, too. Kids will learn to be more patient with  <br/>\neach other, to take care of each other, to pay attention to how  <br/>\nothers are feeling, etc. Look into their eyes now, check in with how  <br/>\nthey&#39;re doing, support what is important to them. Life with these  <br/>\nkids, when they are teens, will be pleasant and comfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the parent of the 14 year old - all the exact same advice! Figure  <br/>\nout how you might apply it to your situation. Don&#39;t worry that the  <br/>\nstakes seem higher - let that go. You still have years!<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":184990613,"authorName":"Cece","from":"&quot;Cece&quot; &lt;cece4@...&gt;","profile":"ceciliagerbig","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: PLEASE help my unschool my 14yo....","postDate":"1180976161","msgId":29075,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY0MWc3MSs5OXZxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGY0MWZiNStuNG40QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":29074,"nextInTopic":29076,"prevInTime":29074,"nextInTime":29076,"topicId":29027,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Meredith I do take what he does seriously.I even started his book series because he wanted me to read them.Its just its been so many years of doing the same","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-688902924\">Meredith I do take what he does seriously.I even started his book <br/>\nseries because he wanted me to read them.Its just its been so many <br/>\nyears of doing the same things.I keep expecting him to start <br/>\nbroadening his horizens.Get knew experiences, that sort of thing.<br/>\nPlus I wonder if this is the best thing for him socially.I guess I <br/>\ndont want him to end up like me either...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Cece&quot; &lt;cece4@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;He doesnt want to try anything new.Ive <br/>\n&gt; &gt; strewn, Ive suggested.He doesnt like change, he wont try new <br/>\n </span></blockquote>foods <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; or <br/>\n&gt; &gt; different clothes either.

Do you have a bunch of companion<br/>\nanimals, like we do, that are endless sources of joy/fun (and work)?<br/>\nIs he chatting with you and other family members about this, that and<br/>\nthe other - the book he&#39;s currently reading? what all is going on in<br/>\nhis corner of computerland, whether he&#39;s a gamer, or a wiki linktrail<br/>\nfollower or whatever it is he&#39;s up to/exploring in his computer and<br/>\nreading time? <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps he spends, and needs to spend a lot of time processing<br/>\ninternally rather than talking about stuff. If so, I can relate. I<br/>\nneed time to stare at the wall or off into space in order to work<br/>\nthrough things, though more often I fill this need in me while<br/>\nstanding at the sink washing dishes and gazing out the window at our<br/>\nback garden or meditatively concentrating on the soapsuds or patterns<br/>\non the plates or whatever I&#39;m tending to, which serves the same sort<br/>\nof purpose for centering myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour post drew my attention particularly because I&#39;m a hermitty type<br/>\nperson by nature. My daughter, K, a 14 yr old only, is a little less<br/>\nintroverted than me, but still happily spends almost all her time at<br/>\nhome, not engaged in or longing for much or any outside activity at<br/>\nthis time in her life - though I should say she did go happily to<br/>\nschool from 5-10.5yrs. <br/>\n<br/>\nK is not fixed on any particular future either, but has thought some<br/>\nabout part-time paid work she might be interested in doing now, or<br/>\nsoonish, and due to ethical/political issues she has with a lot of the<br/>\nworld at large, came up with the library, gallery or museum, maybe, as<br/>\nplaces she thinks/feels she could find comfortable and interesting to<br/>\nbe. I&#39;ve made preliminary enquiries about working at the library, so<br/>\nthat we know how to go about that - they have young people working in<br/>\nthe back and stacking shelves, etc. This work ideas thing is newish so<br/>\nhaven&#39;t got to enquiring at gallery spaces around town yet, nor the<br/>\nmuseum. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are mostly night people at our house right now, and a great deal of<br/>\nK&#39;s time is spent on the computer, reading, listening to music,<br/>\nwatching tv/movies etc. Recently she said &quot;I&#39;d like to learn more<br/>\nabout Napolean&quot;. Don;t know where that came from, nor her last<br/>\nparticular interest in something that looks &quot;educational&quot; to those<br/>\nlooking on through the mainstream lens, which was Hitler/WWII... but<br/>\naround things like that, her interest in media (screen and music,<br/>\nhistory included), the time she spends creating pixel and other art<br/>\nwhich she has websites for/forums she sometimes participates in, and<br/>\nsomething else I meant to say that has gone out of my head right now,<br/>\nshe has fuller days, a fuller, richer life than many looking on would<br/>\nimagine possible, given how small and close her life might look to some. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe do take a few daytrips out of town each year, and attend a few<br/>\nspecific local homeschool events of interest each year, but we&#39;re<br/>\ncertainly not constantly out and about doing things as many people<br/>\nare. Unschooling looks different in every home.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is, again, that I wonder just how empty your 14 yr olds days<br/>\nreally are when you take a closer look. Possibly it&#39;s up to you to<br/>\ntake a closer look/interest in what all he is doing with his time. You<br/>\nmight be surprised what you see there, which might help you relax<br/>\nsome, to be more in the moment, more about *now*. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that&#39;s a lot, and others have asked questions that your answers<br/>\nto will no doubt help people help you. <br/>\n<br/>\nKind regards<br/>\nJo R</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":166322738,"authorName":"Nancy Wooton","from":"Nancy Wooton &lt;nancywooton@...&gt;","profile":"ikonstitcher","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] PLEASE help my unschool my 14yo....","postDate":"1180931914","msgId":29049,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM3ZTU4NTJkMDI0YTA5ODQzNGQ4ZGM0MTI2OTljMDkyQGNveC5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PGYzdmJtMCtiaGZmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGYzdmJtMCtiaGZmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":29035,"nextInTopic":29052,"prevInTime":29048,"nextInTime":29050,"topicId":29027,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
