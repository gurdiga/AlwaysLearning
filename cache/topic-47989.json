You&#39;re trying to seize control  <br/>\nby seizing control of your kids. But  really it&#39;s like herding cats  <br/>\nwhich is an exercise in frustration!<br/>\n<br/>\nFind what you can control. It could be that 7 kids and their needs  <br/>\nfeels like a chaotic mass to you. But they&#39;re a collection of  <br/>\nindividuals with unique needs. Maybe what you&#39;re doing is reacting to  <br/>\ncrises but what you really need is to be proactive to prevent it from  <br/>\nfeeling like a tangled mess that needs whipped into order.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are patterns in the disorder. There are events that are  <br/>\nhappening repeatedly that, with awareness, you can control the  <br/>\nenvironment to prevent them from happening.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might try writing some of it out to get a handle on what feels  <br/>\nout of control and post it to the list. What you&#39;ve written is mostly  <br/>\ntelling us you can&#39;t do this and then what you do in response to  <br/>\nfeeling you can&#39;t do this (eg, impose schooling work.) To help  <br/>\nyourself, you need to back up and examine what&#39;s going on before you  <br/>\nfeel like it&#39;s out of control.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith 7 kids it&#39;s probably hard to find the time! But it&#39;s like  <br/>\nsomeone who feels they need to keep bailing the boat because the  <br/>\nwater keeps leaking in. If they take the time to plug a couple of  <br/>\nleaks they won&#39;t have to bail so hard. And if they&#39;re not bailing so  <br/>\nhard then they can find time to plug up more leaks!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He believes in a strong forced work ethic and kids getting up early  <br/>\n&gt; to do chores ect..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A couple of generations ago, families needed to impose work on kids  <br/>\nto survive. Lots of people had kids to create hands to help. It was  <br/>\neasier for kids to understand the necessity to work because it was  <br/>\ntrue. And an outgrowth of that hard work was a feeling of  <br/>\naccomplishment. (Ideally. Loads of kids fled the constant work on the  <br/>\nfarm as soon as they could!) But without the feeling that the family  <br/>\nwill starve if the cows aren&#39;t watered, imposed chores just feels  <br/>\nlike control. (Don&#39;t tell him that though! I&#39;m sure he doesn&#39;t want a  <br/>\nlesson on how he&#39;s wrong!)<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than thinking in terms of chores, think in terms of helping  <br/>\nhim. Do nice things for him because you love him and he works hard  <br/>\nall day. Include the kids. Ask them if there are nice things they&#39;d  <br/>\nlike to do for him to help him out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a dynamic that often happens in families -- even small  <br/>\nfamilies, even just between a husband and wife -- is that people feel  <br/>\nneedy and they get into a mode of grasping what they can at the  <br/>\nexpense of others to meet their needs. It will help to change that  <br/>\ndynamic.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe what you can do is pick one child a week on a random day and  <br/>\nyou and the other kids secretly do nice things for him or her. The  <br/>\ngoal isn&#39;t to make the kids do nice things. The goal is to feel what  <br/>\nit&#39;s like to have others do nice things for you. :-) That will do a  <br/>\nlot more to encourage generosity of time (so the kids are  more  <br/>\nlikely to want to help with chores) than imposing work on them.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: unschooling- is it for us?","postDate":"1255575848","msgId":48004,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYyMkY2NTUwLTUyMTEtNDE1Qi04N0E2LUQ2MTVFRDE3NjZDNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhiNjBocytuZW91QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhiNjBocytuZW91QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48002,"nextInTopic":48006,"prevInTime":48003,"nextInTime":48005,"topicId":47989,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I ve noticed a particular pattern on these groups where the responders normally have to send a series of clarifications due to the OP not including the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-592985701\">-=-I&#39;ve noticed a particular pattern on these groups where the  <br/>\nresponders normally have to send a series of clarifications due to the  <br/>\nOP not including the pertinent details.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nNobody &quot;has to&quot; do anything; no one has to respond in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen someone asks a question or tells a story and the responses are  <br/>\noff the mark, it doesn&#39;t matter because there are hundreds of  <br/>\nreaders,  none of whom have exactly the original problem, nor the  <br/>\nassumed others, but who have thoughts and ideas or needs and concerns  <br/>\nthat are generally related.

It&#39;s easy to stay stuck in the old-school thinking, as you termed it.  Asking questions can make some people uncomfortable.  It&#39;s been interesting to really think about why I have felt that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what math are you concerned you can&#39;t do and/or can&#39;t see your children understanding?  I used to worry about math, but really, I can do the math I need in my life.  I didn&#39;t do well in high school math, but I can work fractions to cook, balance my checkbook, and use a calculator to figure sales at the grocery store.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I just cant let go and leave things be. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What were your days in school like?  Were they helpful for you?  That was the turning point in our thinking, my husband and myself.  He has a master&#39;s degree but he followed his passions outside the classroom.

I do believe that using a curriculum for my children is taking a lazy way out.  It&#39;s so easy to open the textbook or put the kids in front of the computer screen and let them be &#39;taught&#39;.  Even before I knew about unschooling, I felt uncomfortable watching them struggle with stuff they had no interest in doing.  I hated being told they had to do the stuff they didn&#39;t like because it was learning and was good for them.  It felt, and still feels, so unnatural.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: unschooling- is it for us?","postDate":"1255550864","msgId":47991,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVEMUFEMjU1LTQ1QjEtNEEzRi1BNzdCLTM3NzY4REQ2NTY2RUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhiNTl1aSsxb2d1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhiNTl1aSsxb2d1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47990,"nextInTopic":47997,"prevInTime":47990,"nextInTime":47992,"topicId":47989,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Kerry, Could you provide us with *your* daily routine.

I came to unschooling accidentally last summer and have been reading lots since then. I havent posted much as I am still in a learning mode! I have tried so many times to get comfortable in this mindset but it just doesnt seem to be working out like I had hoped. I am beginning to believe that unschooling just isnt me (or us if you speak in terms of family). No matter how I try I just keep finding myself floating back to the old ways and the school thinking. I worry about everything and because I am math challenged myself I feel like I wont ever be able to help my kids along in math. When someone isnt doing something that looks like school I get worried and begin to make them feel bad by getting annoyed with them for not finding something to do. I guess old habits are hard to break. I think much of it has to do with the fact that I tend to get easily bothered when they look as<br/>\n though they arent actually wanting to do &quot;traditional&quot; school type subjects! I just cant let go and leave things be. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am left to believe that maybe I am just not cut out for unschooling. I mean it feels right and I understand why it works and I agree with it, but yet  I cant make it work for myself. I get irritated and end up yelling at the kids ( I have 7 and it gets hectic around here). I also have a husband who doesnt really get it (but he doesnt mind it either). I try to get him to read things but he never does(super busy farmer). I mean how can it really work when both parties arent on the same page? He believes in a strong forced work ethic and kids getting up early to do chores ect.. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 9 year old tells me it is boring at home and that she is bored! but that changes from day to day. I have signed them up for some fun science classes near by and they are in dance, riding ect.. My 13 year old spends most days at the stable riding. I actually got nervous enough with her and enrolled her in an online middle school program (she is doing well as she has always been self guided and motivated anyways). The fear of the future made me feel like I had to do it. So here I am feeling like I have failed miserably! and I guess I havent actually ever even started because of the things I have done. I envy those of you who live this life freely and whom it works for! I am still a slave to the PS system after all! I guess old habits are harder to break then I thought they would be. Maybe I just am not smart enough to unschool! being a larger family also makes it most challenging and harder I think. I am so afraid to &quot;ruin&quot; my kids! the fear of the<br/>\n unknown is tearing me apart. I wish I could just relax and breathe and have it all work out. I will continue to read posts on here even if unschooling isnt for us. I enjoy the responses and I think we all have something to learn on our parenting journey regardless of if we unschool our children or not. <br/>\n <br/>\nHugs,   Kerry~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47948,"nextTopicId":48021}}
