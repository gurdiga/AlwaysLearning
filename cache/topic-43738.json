Ultimately, at this point,<br/>\nANY thing that I do that isn&#39;t focused on my kids and my family must be<br/>\nseriously examined.  The benefits would have to waaay way outweigh any<br/>\ncons.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling doesn&#39;t necessarily get easier as kids get older, in fact,<br/>\nI&#39;d say, I do MORE now than when my oldest was little.  The things now<br/>\nare much more involved in regards to time commitments, traveling, and<br/>\nphysical involvement.

I could go out tomorrow and get a job<br/>\nand prove to my kids that I can support myself financially, but I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink they&#39;d like that very much, because they like having me here<br/>\nhelping them.

We do not have the issues most two income families have. <br/>\n <br/>\nMy children may not experience the &quot;full amazing transcendent brilliance of natural learning moments&quot; while I run my daycare, but they are getting other amazing moments from it.  For instance, my 2 1/2 year old has picked up the pacifier of a younger child and gave it back to her because she was crying.  She has, on her own, shared her toys and belongings with the daycare children.  I made sure my older daughter&#39;s room was off limits so she has a place to go to get away from the daycare chaos.  My younger daughter also has the choice to play in her room alone if she wants to.  My older daughter is thrilled to help with the daycare next year.  She enjoys coming up with ideas for activities and designs decorations for the coat hooks and bulletin board.  She also loves reading to the daycare children.  I have not asked her to do any of these things she has done them on her own.  I would never expect her to do anything in regards to<br/>\n the daycare. She will have the option of participating or playing on her own.  The daycare children nap from about 12:30-2:30pm so that allows me some one on one time with Anna.  Plus, I close at 4pm and am closed anytime the public schools are, I also don&#39;t work on Wednesday.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI think having my daughters witness me working and being able to help support our family financially is very important.  I grew up with a stay at home mother and was always taken care of financially.  Even though I know I was very fortunate I don&#39;t think it was the best thing.  I hope my girls learn the importance of being able to support themselves in every way including financially.   I feel good knowing that I am able to pay for extra curricular activities for my children that otherwise I might not be able to afford.  Working also allows me to do things for myself without feeling guilty or putting financial strain on the family..  I do not put a lot of importance on &quot;stuff&quot;.  In fact, I requested no gifts for my daughter&#39;s birthdays last year since they have more material things than they will ever need/use.  I explained to Anna that having people take the time to celebrate the day with her was what was important and<br/>\n special, not the gift they bring.  I encouraged extended family members to spend time with her (go to a movie, out to lunch etc) instead of wasting money on a toy that will most likely not be used for more than a few weeks.  I have implemented this policy for everyone in our immediate family, not just our children.   <br/>\n <br/>\nI have also been incorporating community service in our lives and focus on giving rather than receiving whenever possible.  When we go grocery shopping I ask Anna to pick out a few groceries to put in the food pantry bin on the way out.  I ran a goodie bag stuffing party with Anna&#39;s Girl Scout troop for an organization called Birthday Wishes which provides birthday parties for children in homeless shelters.  I am organizing the same event with the Sunday school kids at our church (I am a Sunday school teacher).   <br/>\n <br/>\nI think the beauty of unschooling is that each family can do it the way that works best for them.  I see homeschooling as an opportunity not just a choice and unschooling as even a better choice within that realm.  I continue to learn from this list and am devouring every book I can get my hands on since it is so interesting to me.  I am implementing unschooling into my parenting and am seeing immediate positive results.  I realize I have made some choices that limit being able to fully unschool, but I believe it will still be successful because I am open and committed to doing it.<br/>\n <br/>\nJen   <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43715,"nextTopicId":18654}}
