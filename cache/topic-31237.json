Why do they feel that is going to make a kid prone to<br/>\ndo something bad?<br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\nMy Mom was one who never allowed my brother to play with guns -- toy <br/>\nor real. We lived in the country until he was 10, and every other boy <br/>\nhe knew had a pellet gun.  By high school, my brother&#39;s life dream <br/>\nwas to be a Marine Recon Ranger (he ultimately got 4-F&#39;d) and he <br/>\ncould field-strip and reassemble a M-I in under a minute.  As an <br/>\nadult, he keeps a gun in the house and shoots at a target range, but <br/>\nhas never shot anyone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen oldest son was young, I &#39;allowed&#39; gunplay.  He had nerf guns, <br/>\nnoisy machine guns, a paintball gun at 15, and spent two years of <br/>\nhigh school in ROTC.  He, too, announced his desire to become a <br/>\nMarine.  At 16, he quit all that, and explained that while he still <br/>\nenjoys target practice with real guns, he doesn&#39;t believe he could <br/>\never kill another human being. <br/>\n<br/>\nBoth my son and brother are decent human beings, with no violent <br/>\ntendencies.  My son does seem a gentler soul than my brother -- or <br/>\nmaybe just less battered by life, so less angry.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI believe kids are smarter than many adults give them credit for. <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;. I know mine are.  As unschoolers, we know our kids are bright <br/>\nenough to figure out there&#39;s a difference between real violence and <br/>\ngame playing.  I&#39;d bet that as free children living more autonomous <br/>\nlives, they understand that you don&#39;t have to have a gun to be <br/>\nviolent towards someone else.  That violence isn&#39;t about guns <br/>\n(they&#39;re just tools, after all) -- violence is about power and <br/>\ncontrol over other people. My instincts tell me that people who have <br/>\nbeen controlled, limited or denied by other (more powerful) people <br/>\nare more likely to be violent, than those who have been respected and <br/>\nsupported in pursuit of their own lives. <br/>\n<br/>\nSylvia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] a different gun question","postDate":"1194090386","msgId":31257,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVFNkNGQTUwLTNCRDItNDU5Ri1BN0JFLTVBQjA0NDVEQUUzREBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDk0QUM0QUZBLUIxMTgtNEQ2NS04NDE0LTA2NDU1OTQxMDI3NUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGZnZzJwcStyOWRsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MjE5YTNhMmIwNzExMDIxNDA5cjFkYWJlNWQyajM0MmU1OWJjNzQzYzY1YUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDQwRUM1QzhGLTQ5RTItNDVGMi05MTM3LTk1NjI4QTVGN0U0REBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDk0QUM0QUZBLUIxMTgtNEQ2NS04NDE0LTA2NDU1OTQxMDI3NUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":31245,"nextInTopic":31259,"prevInTime":31256,"nextInTime":31258,"topicId":31237,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think forbidding toy guns is another instance of superstitious magic practiced unwittingly by parents.
