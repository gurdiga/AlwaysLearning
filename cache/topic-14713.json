I found a retirement home and donated over 1000 books.  It <br/>\nfelt so great...and sad...it&#39;s like parting with old friends.  I would <br/>\nhave rather donated them to a nursing home, but all the local ones would <br/>\nonly accept large print.

I<br/>\nlive in SC and have 3 children. I am still trying to<br/>\nfigure out how unschooling works in practice. I<br/>\nunderstand the theory! I have been enjoying the posts<br/>\nimmensely.<br/>\n<br/>\n I had to laugh about the personality  posts because I<br/>\nam Type B.  Definitely not A. I love to sit on my<br/>\nporch and hang out.  We do a lot of school on our<br/>\nporch! Lots of folks in the Low Country of SC love<br/>\ntheir porches!<br/>\n<br/>\nI went to the coolest herpetology presentation not<br/>\nlong ago by a woman who works for an ecology lab.  I<br/>\ntalked with her afterward, and she said she wasn&#39;t<br/>\ninto rigid definitions about what unschooling was or <br/>\nwasn&#39;t, and  thought it somewhat depended on the<br/>\nperson&#39;s reference point.  Other unschoolers might not<br/>\ncall her an unschooler but she definitely leaned that<br/>\nway.  She said she had to make compromises because her<br/>\nhusband was more traditional about school.  He was<br/>\nex-military.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer co-workers definitely saw her as an unschooler.<br/>\nShe said if her kids weren&#39;t so bright that someone<br/>\nwould probably already have turned her in to DSS for<br/>\nacademic neglect.  She grew  up in Boston and knew<br/>\nJohn Holt when he was a teacher.  She said she always<br/>\nknew she wanted to homeschool her kids according to<br/>\nJohn&#39;s philosophy. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, all that to say that it was the first time I<br/>\nhad ever met someone who was Type A and was into<br/>\nunschooling. I asked if a Type A unschooler was an<br/>\noxymoron and she said, &quot;Nah. I just take all my energy<br/>\nand put it into laying out opportunities and resources<br/>\nfor my kids to choose from and doing stuff I want to<br/>\nlearn.&quot; She said that she is probably ADHD, but has<br/>\nlearned how to harness the excess energy into other<br/>\navenues.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe did mention that her children didn&#39;t have the same<br/>\npersonality that she did.  She would love for them to<br/>\nembrace unschooling more, but they are not all that<br/>\nspontaneous like she is and they didn&#39;t have to be<br/>\nconstantly on the go quite as much.  She said they are<br/>\nmore reluctant to go and search out what they want to<br/>\nlearn and stick with it.  Sometimes they want her to<br/>\ndo too much of the work, but she is gently nudging<br/>\nthem to do more on their own. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe said they take after her husband that way and it<br/>\nis sometimes frustrating to her.  She told me not to<br/>\nsweat the small stuff and to do homeschooling<br/>\nwhichever way suited me and my kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nI thought it was interesting when she said sometimes<br/>\nwe want to teach our kids they way we want to be<br/>\ntaught rather than how they want to be taught.  So she<br/>\nthought many styles of homeschooling could be<br/>\nconsidered unschooling IF the child chooses that.  She<br/>\nthought  unschooling was all about choices, learning<br/>\nall the time, and learning outside the box.  She<br/>\nwished that someone had unschooled her, but she is an<br/>\nunschooler now.  She said she is always learning new<br/>\nskills and hopes that role modeling rubs off on her<br/>\nkids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is cool that I had never heard of<br/>\nunschooling before and then I saw an article about it,<br/>\nfound this list, and met the ecology woman all in the<br/>\nspace of a few weeks.
