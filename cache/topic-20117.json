For those interested in a little reading I would recommend<br/>\nThe Transformation of American Quakerism :  Orthodox Friends, 1800-1907   by<br/>\nThomas D. Hamm.  Not a book on children but a very interesting look at the<br/>\nforces inside and outside a society and how mores and practices were<br/>\ninfluenced and changed.  It also gives a sidelong look at the history of<br/>\nevangelical churches in this country including fundamentalism and what used<br/>\nto be called pentacostalism.  I see a lot of unnecessary repeating of<br/>\nhistory in the ranks of  many Christians.

It was from a Mennonite family I got the tract.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the bio page of something I read because the guy has the same name as <br/>\nsomeone my husband works with (not the same guy, I was relieved to find), there <br/>\nwas a list of his beliefs.   Some seemed excitingly contradictory to me, the <br/>\nfirst and last of this subset of his beliefs:<br/>\n<br/>\n*   Christians have no business in earthly politics--voting, running for <br/>\noffice, endorsing candidates, debating political issues, protesting, signing <br/>\npetitions, (in most cases, even) writing letters.<br/>\n<br/>\n*   Life begins at conception.<br/>\n<br/>\n*   Abortion is murder.<br/>\n<br/>\n*   Scientific fooling with the process of human conception, while <br/>\nfascinating, opens too many ethical-moral dilemmas in too many scenarios.<br/>\n<br/>\n*   Capital punishment is the State&#39;s God-given responsibility.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIf God is giving the state a responsibility to take life, <br/>\nhow then is the state &quot;earthly politics&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo as illogical as that seems, this guy&#39;s in the business of promoting <br/>\nsobriety and quietness to children.<br/>\nHe runs a private school.   I guess critical thinking is probably NOT on <br/>\ntheir curriculum.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey have an iesources that are available on it!! Much of what can be found <br/>\nwould fall in the amoral category. However, we all know that the enemy of <br/>\nmankind continues to introduce monstrous amounts of immoral and evil stuff. So I <br/>\ndecided to join those in the service of the King of Kings who are striving to <br/>\nmake available material which is moral, safe, healthful and edifying.<br/>\n<br/>\nI certainly do not make a wholesale recommendation that God&#39;s people go <br/>\non-line. And those that are on-line I encourage to faithfulness. In our home <br/>\ncongregation, some of us modem-ites have signed the following covenant (a totally <br/>\npersonal, non-congregational move): <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI purpose before God and my Brothers to never use my modem to intentionally <br/>\ndownload or view any file (text or graphic) that is sexual, pornographic, <br/>\nobscene, immoral and/or lustful in nature. I also purpose to avoid newsgroups and <br/>\nmailing lists which disseminate similar material. By signing this covenant of <br/>\nBrotherhood accountability, I give my co-signing Brothers the privilege and <br/>\nresponsibility of checking up on my faithfulness in this area.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nQuite a number of you &quot;out there&quot; have written to me to let me know that you <br/>\nhave also bound yourself with this covenant. If you, too, take this vow before <br/>\nGod, I&#39;d be delighted to hear from you via email.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20028,"nextTopicId":20079}}
