Doesn&#39;t sound like she comes to your house, so that problem <br/>\nis already solved.  Meet your dad for lunch or coffee out.  Call him at work or on his cell <br/>\nphone.  I am sure you can find a way to stay connected with him, but keep the toxic away.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe too have the hair comments.  My boys have longer hair and almost on a daily basis, <br/>\nsomeone calls them girls.  Usually it is a stranger that honestly thinks they are girls and <br/>\nsays something like &quot;oh look, you have three girls&quot;.  The boys usually let these comments <br/>\nslide off their backs.  They are used to it, the strangers are making an honest mistake and <br/>\nthey boys know that they are capable of ending these mistakes by getting their hair cut.  I <br/>\nwill take them any time they with to get their hair cut but they like it long and I think they <br/>\nare very handsome.  Now, family and friends feel that it is okay to be more rude.  We <br/>\nconstantly get &quot;when are you going to cut their hair&quot;, &quot;they look like girls&quot;, &quot;I can&#39;t believe <br/>\nyou let them have their hair that long&quot;.  To which I always calmly comment, &quot;it&#39;s their hair, <br/>\nif they want it cut, they can get it cut, if not, they can have it how ever they want it&quot;.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t even bother having a conversation with anyone about it.  Good grief, it is just hair <br/>\nand it is THEIR hair!  A year or more ago, Dh was having a really hard time letting go of <br/>\nthe hair control.  I asked him, &quot;would you make the boys grow their hair long if they didn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to  but you wanted them to have long hair?&quot;  He answered, &quot;of course not&quot; to which I <br/>\nreplied &quot;interesting&quot; and let him ponder it a bit.  He got the point.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings, <br/>\n<br/>\nLara Miller<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;halfshadow1&quot; &lt;halfshadow1@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; February 27<br/>\n&gt; Not Returning to toxic grandmas&#39; house<br/>\n&gt; Yesterday we went to my parents house.

Once she opened the fridge trapping him<br/>\n&gt; against the door of it and the wall edge and was just looking at<br/>\n&gt; him,slighty pushing it to see if he would move. She put steak knives<br/>\n&gt; on the table within his reach, refused to move pots off the front<br/>\n&gt; burners when she invited us for dinner. She is sadistic!
