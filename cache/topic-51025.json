These new questions were asked by other homeschooled children who have certain schoolwork, bedtimes, mealtimes with no snacks between, computer use, etc.  And all those questions simply came up because they were having a sleep-over and were excited about staying up all night if they wanted. One question led to another and then they started comparing their family rules, like ...oh wow, you have your own laptop? My mom makes me use the family computer in the living room.  you&#39;re so lucky!... It&#39;s likely these girls have never encountered unschooling in any form before this.
