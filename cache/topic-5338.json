One is of Tom and I, taken a few <br/>\nyears ago, and there is also one of each of my boys that is about a <br/>\nyear old.  Sorry I don&#39;t have anything more recent.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other events:  We have found a property/community that we are <br/>\nmoving to later this spring for intentional community, for those of <br/>\nyou who were following our odyssey towards that goal.  It is on the <br/>\nOlympic Penninsula near Port Townsend, WA, and we hope to be there <br/>\nbefore summer, or just as soon as we can get ourselves moved.  Tom <br/>\nwill be commuting for a while, staying with family near his job <br/>\nduring the week and spending extended weekends (every Friday off) <br/>\nwith us at the farm 4.5 hours away.  His contract with his current <br/>\nemployer is up at the end of this summer-beginning of fall, at which <br/>\ntime he will look for closer work to where we will be.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are nervous, excited and anxious to finally be making the move.  <br/>\nWe are following our dreams and taking risks in this, not doing the <br/>\nexpected thing and staying where we are financially safe in the life <br/>\nthat we know.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5332,"nextTopicId":5342}}
