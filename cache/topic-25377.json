She refused to respect our choices. We were not<br/>\nlooking for approval, but demanded and expected respect. The same respect we<br/>\nwere willing to give to her choices. It was actually her partner that was<br/>\ncausing all the ruckus (I have never met a more condescending, rude,<br/>\ndisrespectful person in my life), but she had to make choices. We had about<br/>\n2 years of not seeing her and very limited contact via phone. It was not<br/>\neasy, but it was necessary and good. We actually have a very good<br/>\nrelationship with her now. She moved out on her own. She now respects our<br/>\nchoices and even agrees with some of what we do...what she doesn&#39;t agree<br/>\nwith she keeps to herself when the kids are around. We have a pretty good<br/>\ntime now when we get together.<br/>\n<br/>\nI cannot imagine allowing anyone to say such horrible things to me or my<br/>\nchildren.
