I said he was staying in today. He completely doesn&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand why. I tried to tell him about being disrepectful to my needs, he<br/>\njust went and sulked.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t like what I did, but I don&#39;t see any natural consequences here and<br/>\nI&#39;m tired of just being ignored. Anybody have any better suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone made a much WORSE suggestion:<br/>\n     <br/>\n&lt;&lt;He&#39;s made his bed...let him lie in it.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, he&#39;s a little boy.  His mom made him a bed he cannot comfortably lie in, <br/>\nand she needs to make him a better bed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;You gave him a reasonable request, for his own safety, and not just to boss <br/>\nhim<br/>\naround. He ignored it.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe made a reasonable request and the mom said no.<br/>\nHe made a reasonable request and the mom ignored it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;He did what he wanted.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a child is being unschooled, most of his day MUST be doing what he <br/>\nwants.  And if the mom doesn&#39;t want to help create an environment where he can do <br/>\nLOTS of things he wants, maybe school would be a safer, better place for him.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;You laid down the law. Now stick to your guns! &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not a cowboy justice list.<br/>\nI&#39;m sure you could find one, and they&#39;ll say &quot;take a razor strop to him out <br/>\nbehind the shed.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is an unschooling list.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis kind of advice is really not at all helpful:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;If you give in, he&#39;ll know you are a sucker and he&#39;ll keep<br/>\ndoing it. After a few days worth of limited freedom, he&#39;ll change his ways.<br/>\nBut you have to be firm and not give in, and you have to be willing to let him<br/>\ndislike you for a little while.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I know a lot of people are really into freedom and choices for their kids. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Those who are not will not find unschooling workable.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16854,"nextTopicId":16934}}
