My 14-year-old was, I thought, going to read and write early.  <br/>\nAfter all, Michelle printed her name clearly at 3 1/2 with no  <br/>\nprompting from me. Imagine my surprise when my expectations were  <br/>\nwrong, again and again.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe started reading around 9, was comprehending more difficult  <br/>\nmaterial at 11, and started typing in earnest at 12. But writing? Ha!  <br/>\nAbout 3 months ago, it took her weeks to decide to print her name for  <br/>\nher passport (which I traced onto the application as she didn&#39;t feel  <br/>\nconfident trying to get her words to fit the prescribed space). I sign  <br/>\ncards for her, fill out forms, whatever she needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI worried now and again that she might never write anything. That  <br/>\nmaybe her name at 3 1/2 was it. She had written a few words here and  <br/>\nthere, but not more than maybe 100 between then and now. When she was  <br/>\n10 or so, I bought an italic writing workbook and once when I had  <br/>\nfallen asleep beside her, she completed a couple of pages of letters  <br/>\non her own, but never picked it up again. I asked once, then dropped  <br/>\nit. I&#39;ve asked, now and then, if she wants to sign a card or present  <br/>\nand the answer was always no. Sometimes, I pushed a bit, but realized  <br/>\nthat wasn&#39;t helping. I took heart from everything I had read and  <br/>\nwitnessed in the unschooling community about this.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the last couple of months, I started noticing scraps of paper in  <br/>\nher room with names of WoW, Pokemon or Digimon characters. Then, I was  <br/>\naway for a couple of weeks and came home to find she&#39;d written a note  <br/>\nto her dad about when she planned to wake up the next day. A few days  <br/>\nago, at her clay-sculpting table, she had a list of Neopets she wanted  <br/>\nto sculpt, their names, colors, and specific identifying marks. There  <br/>\nare more words on that paper than I think I&#39;ve ever seen in her  <br/>\nhandwriting for the past 11 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer writing was printing, all in caps, but spelled correctly, legibly,  <br/>\nand included editing suggestions to herself (she spelled a word wrong,  <br/>\ncorrected it, wrote &quot;ignore that&quot; above it, but wasn&#39;t happy with how  <br/>\nshe formed the &quot;g&quot;, so wrote another &quot;g&quot; above it with a mark to  <br/>\ninsert it &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nI knew in my heart that she would write when she felt a need or saw a  <br/>\nreason to do it. I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll write more when she wants to. I&#39;m  <br/>\nglad I didn&#39;t force her to do it. I&#39;m glad I saved our relationship by  <br/>\nstopping myself more often than not from annoying her about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle types faster, and with better spelling when she types, than I  <br/>\ndo. She said she uses two fingers at the most, because she&#39;s usually  <br/>\ntyping while fighting a battle in World of Warcraft. She notices if  <br/>\nshe misspells something and corrects it right then. She types, spells,  <br/>\nand writes sentences better than many adult players she raids with.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m the only one in the family that writes in cursive. Ross learned it  <br/>\nin school, but never took to it - he print/writes in his own  <br/>\ninimitable style. I think Michelle will find what works best for her,  <br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jul 15, 2009, at 2:51 AM, Ed Wendell wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; It took me a while at first, with the first reference to CIO, to  <br/>\n&gt; figure out the acronym.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lisa<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

One day I held a baby that didn&#39;t cry. Both of the parents of the baby were in the hospital dealing with AIDS and weren&#39;t able to provide the care the baby needed. The nurses and volunteers held the baby when they could, but it wasn&#39;t enough. The baby had stopped crying from lack of proper response to his cries. He usually was in a room by himself. He was held when people could not when he needed or asked for it.? I believe he was HIV positive.......The reason he was in a room by himself in the hospital. ? I always think about this with CIO. You could get a baby that doesn&#39;t cry because it never gets a response. I find that very sad and I&#39;ve always thought of that baby when I hear people suggesting CIO. A very deprived environment could create a baby that doesn&#39;t cry. Is that really what CIO advocates are going for. I think it&#39;s very sad.

I would nurse her to sleep, and then not  <br/>\nagain until the morning when we were waking up for the day. There  <br/>\nwere a couple of nights where she wanted to nurse more than I felt I  <br/>\ncould to fall asleep, and a few nights where she woke up in the  <br/>\nmiddle and wanted to nurse and I reminded her I wasnt nursing until  <br/>\nthe morning. She cried a little these few times. I felt bad that she  <br/>\nwas upset, but I still saw the big picture. She was a 3 year old who  <br/>\nhad nursed pretty much whenever she wanted up till then, I was only  <br/>\nnight weaning her, instead of fully weaning her (which I was  <br/>\nsometimes very tempted to do!), but was continuing to nurse her thru  <br/>\na pregnancy because I thought she still needed it. She was sleeping  <br/>\nin our bed, next to her parents, who love and hug and kiss her all  <br/>\nthe time. I wasnt making her &quot;cry it out&quot;, I was helping her thru a  <br/>\ntransition.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was 3 my parents bought me a new bedroom set, one that I didnt  <br/>\nget to help pick out. I never liked it. They moved me out of my crib,  <br/>\nwhich was in a separate room from theirs, into this giant double bed  <br/>\nand I was terrified of it. I was afraid if I slept in the middle of  <br/>\nit, it would somehow cave in and the things under the bed would get  <br/>\nme. I slept so close to the edge that my parents often found me  <br/>\nfallen off the bed and onto the floor when they came upstairs to bed.  <br/>\nI insisted the hall light be kept on, and I usually stayed awake for  <br/>\nhours, telling myself stories or playing with my dolls. I felt very  <br/>\nlonely. Id ask my parents where they would be downstairs, so I could  <br/>\nknow how loud Id need to yell in case of emergency. My younger sister  <br/>\nis 9 yrs younger than me. I remember her crying in her crib a LOT. It  <br/>\nwas hard for me because I couldnt console her.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, when I got my new bed, my brother moved into another room. I  <br/>\nwas 2 when he was born, and when they brought him home, they had a  <br/>\n(separate) room all set up for him, but I insisted that they move &quot;my  <br/>\nbaby&quot; into my room. My mom said it was strange to have two cribs next  <br/>\nto each other in my room, but I wouldnt let them move him out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have thought many times over the last 5 years that being the mother  <br/>\nI want to be is healing the child I used to be.

All of my children continue to successfully mature in different areas within their own perfect, yet varying, time frame.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy extreme example of this is my daughter. She was my personal &quot;cling-on&quot; from birth to the age of four. If I left her for five minutes or five hours she would SCREAM the entire time I was gone. Most people were adamant (and quite rude and intrusive) that I should let her cry it out or she would grow up to be a social misfit and recluse. (Most of these people wanted to hold her or baby-sit or felt she should be in the church nursery. Some even suggested that I stop nursing so she would not be so attached!?!) I have always been a rebel and continued to follow my gut and hold and spend time with all of my children, as much as they wanted. (I still do at ages 11-21, although they do not wish to be carried about anymoreor sleep together often, although we often fall asleep in the same rooms. We do spend a lot of time sprawled out together on a bed, sofa or floor during the day. BWG)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she went to kindergarten she suddenly became a confident, social butterfly. The kids loved her and she loved the kids. She stayed home after kindergarten until she chose to go to public school for 12th grade. Of course, she had a very active social life between those years. She joined the dance team, puppet team, and drama team, was in many child and teen leadership positions at church, and spent LOTS of time with friends. She and her friends created clubs and came up with all kinds of neat ideas and projects. Later, she went to school for 12th grade. During her senior year she was on the cheerleading squad, attended sporting events, prom, parties, dances, worked at the local ice cream shop and much more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis child, who most people warned would be a social misfit and a recluse, blossomed into one of the most popular girls around. She never showed any signs of any sort of social deficiency, in fact, she was profoundly socially proficient! She will be 19 soon and continues to have an active social life, and a good job, and nice apartment.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, all that to say that I firmly believe that the advice to &quot;let her cry it out&quot; is cruel and very likely would have stunted her emotional growth, and created the kinds of insecurities that lead to the negative social issues the advice-givers were warning about. <br/>\n<br/>\n-Kathryn</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":227835915,"authorName":"m_aduhene","from":"&quot;m_aduhene&quot; &lt;m_aduhene@...&gt;","profile":"m_aduhene","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: interesting article on co-sleeping and nursery school anxiety","postDate":"1247444034","msgId":46416,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGgzZHU4MitlMHU0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEM4ODc0QzQyMzJGMTRBOUE5NjFCMkY3RkVGMjYxMTYxQGd4Mjgwc3NmM2ZjMGZlPg=="},"prevInTopic":46415,"nextInTopic":46417,"prevInTime":46415,"nextInTime":46417,"topicId":46411,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"my son (5) had a friend stay over also 5, but an older 5. they both happily got into bed together.  friend fell asleep quickly.  then  my son who shares our","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1874886782\">my son (5) had a friend stay over also 5, but an older 5.<br/>\nthey both happily got into bed together.  friend fell asleep quickly.  then  my son who shares our bed every night came and climbed in next to us, snuggled up and fell asleep.  i was awoken in the night by a strange noise............the sound of crying.  the little man in the other room had awoken and was crying (don&#39;t know if he does this at home.....).............just strange to hear a child cry in the night as mine have never done this.  they have only had to arouse sufficiently to latch on (even if they need to rouse at all) feed happily and, all is calm and peaceful. <br/>\n<br/>\nwhen my first child was born the midwife suggested putting the babay in the moses basket/cot, raising the mattress slightly at the head end, putting a breast pad with my milk on it next to her face, putting a hot water bottle in the cot to warm the mattress (and removing it before baby goes in), and then...........putting a ticking clock in there too to imitate the mother&#39;s heartbeat........<br/>\nhmmm!!!!!!!!! glad to say i didn&#39;t even go there and my daughter is still with us at 8.  we have all three of our children in with us and not a clock between us!!!<br/>\n<br/>\ni have never put a crying child to bed or left a crying baby in a room alone.........cannot imagine anything worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nblessings<br/>\nmichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265930215,"authorName":"Jason & Stephanie","from":"&quot;Jason & Stephanie&quot; &lt;jay_steph93@...&gt;","profile":"mom_to_kbcj","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] interesting article on co-sleeping and nursery school anxiety","postDate":"1247435787","msgId":46415,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM4ODc0QzQyMzJGMTRBOUE5NjFCMkY3RkVGMjYxMTYxQGd4Mjgwc3NmM2ZjMGZlPg==","referencesHeader":"PDE3NGRmOWRjMDkwNzEyMTQxNWg0MWY4MDM3YndjN2Y1Y2Q5ZDUxZDM4NmQ0QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8NkNFQTJCMzYtRkU1Ny00NzVDLThDRUYtNDVFREEzMTdBRkY5QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46412,"nextInTopic":46416,"prevInTime":46414,"nextInTime":46416,"topicId":46411,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Symptoms can also be physical.

An English study shows that children&#39;s stress level goes up in<br/>\nnursery school.   *for more than 90%, cortisol rises when they go to<br/>\nnursery. For 75%, it falls whenever they go home*(timesonline)*.<br/>\n*<br/>\n The article also has very recent information gathered in the last twenty<br/>\nyears that debunks all the &quot;old doctor&#39;s tales&quot; and finds proof to<br/>\nsubstantiate the long line of &quot;granny&quot; advice.  A friend of mine tells the<br/>\nstory of her late grandma coming over and finding both her daughter and<br/>\ngrandchild crying and asked what was wrong.  The baby wanted to eat more<br/>\noften than every four hours, but the doctor said if nursing the baby too<br/>\noften resulted in milk drying up. Grandma, having breastfed five babies<br/>\npronounced this a load of bunk and my friend was breastfed on demand from<br/>\nthen on.  Everybody was happier.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother weaned me at six weeks on the advice of a doctor, as did my<br/>\nmother-in law wean my husband.  I was gaining too quickly, therefore the<br/>\nmilk was too rich and bound to be a problem in the longterm my mother was<br/>\ntold by our family doctor.  My husband was weaned for failure to thrive.  My<br/>\nmother breastfed on demand, quickly discovering the time limit didn&#39;t work.<br/>\nMy mother-in-law the nurse followed verbatim the medical dictums on<br/>\nbreastfeeding.  But it seems babies couldn&#39;t win whether they gained or not!<br/>\n<br/>\nNote the article also points to a *neurological study three years ago showed<br/>\nthat a child separated from a parent experienced similar brain activity to<br/>\none in physical pain(ibid)*<br/>\n<br/>\nKind of makes one wonder about all those pre-school/nursery school<br/>\nadvocates!  Where I live there is a move to start full day kindergarten.  I<br/>\nam guessing nobody saw the studies Margot Sunderland, director of education<br/>\nat the Centre for Child Mental Health in London, seems to have found!<br/>\n<br/>\nI know as a parent my observations support gentle responsive parenting<br/>\npractices.  I have seen how my children are able to achieve independence on<br/>\ntheir own terms, with confidence.  It is nice to see more science to back<br/>\nthe importance of parent-child bonds.  Maybe the unschooling teens will show<br/>\nup as having optimal hormonal balances in a future study :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMarina<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nRent our cottage:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://davehoward.ca/cottage/\">http://davehoward.ca/cottage/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46434,"nextTopicId":46436}}
