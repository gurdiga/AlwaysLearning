She&#39;s 17 and although  <br/>\nshe never has had any writing classed, she like words.  She didn&#39;t  <br/>\nread until she was eleven years old, though she was writing before  <br/>\nthen by asking people how to spell words.<br/>\n<br/>\nStems is a flower shop a block from here.  Zumiez is a store in the  <br/>\nmall aimed at skateboarders and snowboarders.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nTIME<br/>\nSo on Mondays from 1 to 6 I work at Stems.<br/>\n<br/>\nMonday has become a total week-marker for me, even though I&#39;ve been  <br/>\nhardcorely mixing every other day up, it really clears things out week- <br/>\nto-week wise. Well realizing it&#39;d been two weeks since the first night  <br/>\nI hung around with Mike and Lyndsey, I also realized how much shorter  <br/>\nit was from the 30th to the 6th as opposed to the 6th to today. I&#39;ve  <br/>\nbeen trying to put my finger on just what makes different weeks or  <br/>\nmonths seem long and exhausting or short and exhausting.<br/>\nNot to say that I&#39;ve been totally exhausted, but a lot has been going  <br/>\non.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think after the 30th of March I was doing something everyday.  <br/>\nZumiez, Stems, or something very stimulating, but away from home. This  <br/>\nlast week, though, I feel like I would have a big day and then a down  <br/>\nday. Or a busy morning and then a relaxed afternoon. Or even sleep  <br/>\nlate and wake up to an exciting day.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was posted in an on online place few people read.  It&#39;s mostly  <br/>\nfor her own thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she were to ask for help editing it, I think I would suggest a  <br/>\nclean-up of the first long sentence starting with &quot;Monday...&quot; and  <br/>\npoint out that in &quot;I was doing something every day&quot; it should be two  <br/>\nwords that way because it&#39;s telling when, not what-kind-of (adverb and  <br/>\nnot adjective).   She would probably have caught it if she were  <br/>\nreading someone else&#39;s writing.   Few adults even understand that  <br/>\nanymore, but Holly usually sees it.    And a dash between &quot;every day&quot;  <br/>\nand &quot;Zumiez&quot; would be better than a period.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy &quot;down day&quot; she doesn&#39;t mean depressed or sad; she means a day  <br/>\nwithout requirements or schedules.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy favorite part is this:<br/>\n-=- I&#39;ve been trying to put my finger on just what makes different  <br/>\nweeks or months seem long and exhausting or short and exhausting.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly&#39;s interested in dreams and memory.  She&#39;s interested in  <br/>\nperception.   All of that is about brain function and biochemistry.   <br/>\nHow do people know what they know?  How do people process and retrieve  <br/>\nthoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people would say &quot;then she needs to study psychology.&quot;   And in  <br/>\nthe sense of going to a university and getting a psychology degree,  <br/>\nshe might.  She might do that someday.  But she&#39;s trying to put her  <br/>\nfinger on some of it now.  She&#39;s been thinking and observing and  <br/>\nasking questions about these things already for years, and probably  <br/>\nwill keep doing that because she&#39;s curious and interested.   Some of  <br/>\nthose people who plan to study psychology just put it all out of their  <br/>\nminds and wait for the professors they&#39;ve paid to teach them to put  <br/>\nsome facts into their willing and open blank slate minds.  Holly is  <br/>\nbuilding on what she already perceives.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some samples for those who wonder what I&#39;m talking about with  <br/>\nthe difference between every day and everyday:<br/>\n<br/>\nSome days I think she might go to college someday.<br/>\nI think everyday thoughts every day.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the purpose of this post, past showing a sample of Holly&#39;s  <br/>\nwriting, and to show you how I unschool (for those who want &quot;but how?&quot;  <br/>\nand &quot;like what?&quot;).  Being able to see several aspects of something is  <br/>\npart of what has made unschooling work well for me.   Holly wrote that  <br/>\nto express herself and her thoughts to a very few people.   Writing it  <br/>\nhelped to clarify her own thoughts, and she&#39;s made a record for  <br/>\nherself of what she was doing which she can refer back to in years to  <br/>\ncome (when she started hanging out with those two friends, who are  <br/>\nstudents at La Cueva High--friends of another friend of hers, and she  <br/>\nbought a skateboard from Mike).    It shows the mechanics of her  <br/>\nwriting, which are in the range of most adults who are willing to  <br/>\nwrite in public.   So she&#39;s not &quot;behind&quot; there.  It&#39;s a glimpse into  <br/>\nher thoughts on perception (perceiving the passage of time).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is how I can know whether she&#39;s learning without giving her a test.<br/>\nThis is how I can compare her progress to other people her age.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49148,"nextTopicId":49181}}
