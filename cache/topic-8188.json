We did try school-at-home <br/>\nfor about 6 weeks or so... It was miserable! I read some unschooling books <br/>\n(by Holt) and magazines (GWS) and talked to unschoolers and it began to sink <br/>\nin little by little. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are boys ages 13 and 10 and a dd age 4.5 yrs.  We just moved to TX <br/>\nbut are from MA (me) and ME (dh).  So TX is very different and hot!   But a <br/>\ngood place to homeschool - no reporting!  We are Christians which makes it <br/>\ninteresting as most Christian hsers I know just don&#39;t get unschooling &lt;g&gt;.  <br/>\nSometimes I just avoid the &quot;u&quot; word and say we are &#39;really relaxed&#39;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGreat list!
