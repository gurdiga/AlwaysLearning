We brought <br/>\nthe idea to him, made positive comments when he used the toilet, and  really <br/>\nfocussed a lot on it right around when he was 4. My mother &quot;annoyingly&quot;  made a <br/>\nhuge to do about reward stickers at her house and used The Poodle Voice  of <br/>\nParental Approval. Dave and I rolled our eyes at this, but just let it slide.  We <br/>\nfigured he&#39;d get it and we didn&#39;t want to push it and cause problems. We  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t realize at the time that we were pushing our agenda-even ever so  <br/>\nslightly, but we do now. Wyl still had slip-ups now and then after he was  &quot;mostly <br/>\npotty trained&quot; but ended up getting a bladder infection that came to a  head when <br/>\nhe was at my mother&#39;s house without his parents and had an accident on  her <br/>\n(relatively) new couch. She berated him and yelled at him. Yeah, a  <br/>\npotty-training 4 year old. He never had an accident after that and I still  wonder how <br/>\nmuch he&#39;s internalized about that incident.<br/>\n <br/>\nStorm is 5 1/2 years younger than Wyl (he&#39;ll be turning 4 this  month) and <br/>\nwe&#39;ve had 5 1/2 years more experience on our unschooling path, so  Storm has <br/>\ngotten pretty much the full unschool experience. Except for a  slip here and <br/>\nthere where Dave or I would mention what he could do if he wasn&#39;t  wearing a <br/>\ndiaper, we did no &quot;training&quot;. When he started showing an interest in  the toilet <br/>\nand other family member&#39;s &quot;goings on&quot;, we answered his questions and  let him <br/>\nlook. We showed him the &quot;kid potty&quot; we had bought when Wyl was 3 and  left it <br/>\nout on the floor where he could look if he wanted, sit on it with the  lid <br/>\nclosed or open, use it as a table, or ignore it. There was a lot of  ignoring. It <br/>\ngathered dust. He enjoyed tearing off toilet paper and dropping it  in the <br/>\ntoilet and watching it a moment, then flushing. Flushing is pretty fun,  <br/>\napparently! Every once in a while, I&#39;d start getting edgy about &quot;wasting water&quot;  and <br/>\nI&#39;d catch myself, *breathe* and relax. He got really interested in putting  the <br/>\nend of the roll of toilet paper into the bowl and flushing and watching the  <br/>\nribbon unfurl from the 1000 sheet roll of T.P. and swirl down into that  <br/>\nmysterious place where water goes when you flush. I attempted once or twice to  <br/>\nexplain about frugal paper usage, but ended up saving the last bits of the roll  <br/>\nfor our dispenser, while the rest of us who used &quot;just what we needed&quot; used the <br/>\n plain roll out of the drawer. That worked really well, and as time has <br/>\npassed  and he had the opportunity to use T.P. out in public where there are  <br/>\nserrated-edged T.P. cutters, he was very good about taking what he needed, so I  <br/>\nincreased the amount of what I left on the roll for the dispenser. We really  <br/>\nneed to find a cutter for ours... it is just too hard to tear it from where its  <br/>\nat, all open with no cover. Especially for someone that needs one or two <br/>\nhands  to hold himself up on the seat to keep from falling in! He started with a  <br/>\nsmaller seat that fits on the big seat and used that for a while, but he wants <br/>\n to be like everyone else, so he won&#39;t use it any more.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe&#39;d go through phases where he got really interested in going  or being near <br/>\nthe toilet, then nothing to do with it for a while. Dave and I  knew it would <br/>\ncome, eventually. We weren&#39;t concerned in the least. He used  toilets a *lot* <br/>\nat the Live and Learn conference. Shortly before we left, he got  interested <br/>\nin the small potty again-which was fortuitus, since that was our  &quot;bathroom on <br/>\nthe go&quot; for the trip. He&#39;d get very upset if I hadn&#39;t emptied the  potty in <br/>\nwhat he perceived as the right amount of time. <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen we got back from the conference, and while we healed  from being sick, <br/>\nhe did a lot of diapers, but once he felt better, he peed  almost exclusively <br/>\nin the toilet, though he still used diapers for more solid  matters. This past <br/>\nweek, we&#39;ve been either requested for &quot;company&quot; in the  bathroom when he&#39;s had <br/>\nto go, been &quot;paged&quot; that he needed wiped, or (I have no  idea how he does <br/>\nthis, but we definitely try to avoid it!) he&#39;ll come downstairs  with his pants <br/>\naround his ankles and request help wiping!<br/>\n <br/>\nA few times in the learning process, he&#39;s gotten his  pants wet. We&#39;ve not <br/>\nmade a big deal out of it other than to get him into dry  clothes so he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhave to have urine against his skin-just like we would for  a diaper leak. He <br/>\nwent upstairs by himself the other day and came down with his  shorts and <br/>\nunderwear in his hand and said very calmly and unconcerned, &quot;These  are wet, Mama. <br/>\nI peed on them.&quot; As I set aside the wet ones and got him dry  clothes to put <br/>\non, it occurred to me to ask Dave, &quot;How long has it been since  *you* changed <br/>\na diaper?&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nWell, what do you know? It&#39;s been at least a week! It happened  so naturally <br/>\nand so much in the rhythm of our daily lives, it wasn&#39;t some  much-heralded <br/>\nmilestone. I mean it *is*, in a way, but so different from Wyl&#39;s  journey. No <br/>\ncalling anyone to spread the word for all to know, no Grandmas or  Aunts <br/>\nclaiming &quot;You&#39;re a BIG boy, NOW.&quot; Just a side note to the day; Wyl found a  new area <br/>\nin his video game, Storm isn&#39;t using diapers any more, I got those  too-small <br/>\nclothes organized and put away.
