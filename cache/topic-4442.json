But when emotions are running high, its not always possible for people to stop and work things out - heck, that&#39;s true of adults, much less little kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nOutside of any kind of stressful moment, its valuable to brainstorm other ways to break things up, and knowing the temperaments of the kids is important in that.

That&#39;s another benefit of stepping in with a solution - even if the solution is to offer a snack, or scoop the little one up and say &quot;let&#39;s go blow bubbles&quot;.

The toy goes away.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>****************<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes when kids are fighting over an object (toy, controller, remote...) it can help to put the object out of sight for a little, but that&#39;s reeeeeaaaallllly situational and depends on the dynamic between the kids. In any case there&#39;s no need whatsoever to belittle the people involved by pretending &quot;the toy needs a time out&quot;. Put the toy out of sight and see if that helps, or offer to do so and see if the kids find that helpful. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;It is also more positive for me to time the *toy* out, than to time the *child* out. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>******************<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can help to step all the way away from the whole idea of &quot;time out&quot;. Its not a good tool for problem solving! Getting away from times out involves learning a new set of skills, skills that get you more involved with the kids outside of crises so that you can prevent more of them, and in the process help the kids develop more skills of their own - and you, too (generic &quot;you&quot;: the parent). <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In my home, a child could hit or push me *once*, and then I would take action to stop that immediately.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>************<br/>\n<br/>\nIts good to be clear about your own boundaries! I want to be really clear about that, because sometimes messages about helping children can come across as saying parents shouldn&#39;t have boundaries. Boundaries are good things. Clear communication is a good thing, too. At the same time, parents are adults, which means they can be expected to have more skills, more reserves of energy and kindness and empathy than children. A child who&#39;s falling apart to the point of hitting needs kindness and empathy. A child who can&#39;t find a way to communicate beyond hitting needs those too. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; into a same-room time out, into time out in their room, asked to run 10 laps around the swingset in the back yard. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>\n<br/>\nTimes out and penalties are punishments. They happen because there&#39;s a threat of violence behind them, that&#39;s one of the things adults forget when kids are compliant. When someone is punished they learn a whole lot about power and anger and force, about resentment and denial and vengence. That doesn&#39;t always leave room for the &quot;lesson&quot; the &quot;teacher&quot; intends. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":336246301,"authorName":"NCMama","from":"&quot;NCMama&quot; &lt;dharmamama1@...&gt;","profile":"carenkh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: fighting","postDate":"1277850980","msgId":55500,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGkwZHNoNCtzNXF0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGkwZG4yciszcHIyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":55498,"nextInTopic":55501,"prevInTime":55499,"nextInTime":55501,"topicId":4442,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"=-=She was mostly pushing and hyperfocused on getting back to that wagon.

It&#39;s a 70 acre greenway with over 7 playgrounds in it.  So as we biked along, the kids would stop at the different parks and hop on swings or go down slides.  One of the kids, every time he saw one of the other kids heading for a particular swing, would try to get there first to use it.  It was really causing the other kids to be mad at him.  The first 2 times I let it go because we hopped back onto our bikes and moved on to the next playground.  After that I told him to stop taking other people&#39;s &quot;whatever&quot; when he knew full well that they were going to use it.  He said he wanted to use it too, which is completely understandable.  So, I told him that he&#39;d get a turn, but that he needed to wait for it rather than steal it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe got mad and rode off on his bike and said he wasn&#39;t going to be friends with anyone there, ever again.  The other kids were really worried about him doing that.  I told them to let it go and that surely he&#39;d come right back, because if he went home without us he&#39;d get in a lot of trouble with his mother who only let him go because he was with an adult.  He came back and was nicer, after blowing off some steam on a short and intense bike ride.  He got his turn and all of the kids were nicer after that.  If I hadn&#39;t cared whose fault it was, it would have escalated and caused all the kids to continue fighting.  This kid was the youngest one in the group, yet is probably the biggest bully in the neighborhood.

This kind of advice would be a huge step backwards for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor others reading and gaining ideas from this whole topic, it seems important to point out that dealing with the symptoms works for some kids to get results, but all of it comes at a cost.  Kids can be motivated by threats and mom&#39;s rules.  Kids can also learn how to be kinder and gentler because they truly know and see a reason to be and that sort of thing takes a lot of time sometimes.  Sometimes it takes years for a kid to be aware that hitting and screaming and anger aren&#39;t great tools to use.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are plenty of kids in our neighborhood that have never figured that out and don&#39;t appear to be getting any proactive ideas for doing it another way.  The behavior can get a child in trouble with parents, either their own or others, or other kids, but they have nothing to replace it with because it is only addressing the symptoms and not the root cause of instant anger and frustration and why and how they got there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ways in which people are suggesting understanding the child&#39;s perspective and really getting behind the cause of the behavior, doesn&#39;t always mete out immediate results.  It&#39;s constant and continuous tweeking and being there more and being more aware, and then one day that child &quot;gets it&quot;.  It doesn&#39;t mean that a parent allows or condones hitting and angry outbursts, it means that the ways in which these are addressed work towards a different goal that is much more long term.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy youngest is 8.  She&#39;s dealt with anger and frustration and hitting and yelling.  She still does it sometimes.  It is always something that could have been avoided.  Working with her to avoid those triggers helps her know where her limits and buttons are that trigger these things.  The older she gets, the better she is getting at taking herself out of the situation BEFORE she blows it, and when she gets stuck, she&#39;s finding better ways to take herself out while she blowing it.  I can be her safe place or I can be another voice telling her to &quot;knock it off&quot;.  She&#39;s already got one of those in her own head, and even when I &quot;feel&quot; like telling her that, I know it&#39;s not going to be helpful to get her to a place of calm, centered, and happy again.  When she&#39;s that far into a rage, it&#39;s best to let her get it out and do as much damage control as possible with kindness and patience.  If I can see before she gets that far, that&#39;s even better, and I can<br/>\n distract her enough for her to stay clear headed.<br/>\n<br/>\n***When a single child is abusing a toy, or two children are fighting over a toy, I often say, &quot;Oh, looks like this toy needs to do a time out.&quot; And it does. The toy goes away.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI can tell you that this has unintended consequences.  My oldest is 16 and she was my &quot;I&#39;m learning how to be a parent&quot; child.  I did do stuff like that.  Even though it felt like the right thing to do, she still remembers vividly some instances in which I did that and thought all was well and everyone moved on, but she came away from it with a VERY different view of it.  Primarily one of not being heard or respected.  She&#39;s 16 and STILL remembers NOT being heard and respected!!!!  I repeated that because it&#39;s important!<br/>\n<br/>\nHelping kids not fight over toys is a good thing, helping them to not destroy things is a good thing.  Taking toys away and putting them out of reach or in time out to encourage the kids to get along better doesn&#39;t seem like the best answer.  Distractions are great.  Adding to the play in happy and fun ways are wonderful.  Stepping in to prevent a child from being hurt or hurting another is a good thing.  In the best of circumstances, most conflict can be avoided.  That doesn&#39;t always happen, but moms and dads have a great power to make peace happen by being peaceful and calm and listening and understanding and distracting. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: fighting","postDate":"1277834234","msgId":55480,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdFMkRFMzE2LTYwRkYtNDU0OC1CREM3LTVEQjBDQzNGMDU5RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEY5QkVFRDFERTY1MjRGQ0Q5RDU2RUEyNTZDRUQxMjU2QFBIUFZpZGVvVkFJTz4=","referencesHeader":"PGkwYnZpdCtpdjMxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8QzlEMTlEOTgtREVCOC00MkJBLUExRTktQjUxRjczMTkzNkNFQHZlcml6b24ubmV0PiA8NEMyQTJBMzguODA3MDgwOUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0PiA8Qzk2Mzg3RUItNDA1Mi00NTU0LTlEQUQtNDAzMTQzOTlDNTU5QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8RjlCRUVEMURFNjUyNEZDRDlENTZFQTI1NkNFRDEyNTZAUEhQVmlkZW9WQUlPPg=="},"prevInTopic":55479,"nextInTopic":55489,"prevInTime":55479,"nextInTime":55481,"topicId":4442,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I have on occasion said, right at this moment it is irrelevant who started it or if I m not being calm...

Never.  My  <br/>\nparents took in two cousins, one when I was nearly seven, and one when  <br/>\nI was eight.  Sisters.  So there was one eight months older than I was  <br/>\n(and in the same grade) and one a year older than my sister (and in  <br/>\nthe same grade, because starting dates were different in the state  <br/>\nwhere she had lived earlier).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in a snapshot moment, we were 12, 11, 9 and 8.<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers said &quot;Oh how cute!  It&#39;s like two sets of twins.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was NOT like two sets of twins.  The cousin my age was sweet and  <br/>\ngood and interesting and honest, but I didn&#39;t like the fact that I was  <br/>\nno longer the oldest, and that I had to share my room, and then my  <br/>\nmother was always praising and bragging her up.    Not twins.     Her  <br/>\nsister was a horrible abuse and neglect case who had been taken from  <br/>\nher mother by the courts.  Some parts of being at our house weren&#39;t  <br/>\nmuch better for her.  The fact of her being at our house made it much  <br/>\nworse for all of the rest of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was violent and mean.  What I didn&#39;t know until years later was  <br/>\nthat she was sexually messing with my sister.  My sister didn&#39;t tell,  <br/>\nbecause up to that point everything she had reported got them both in  <br/>\ntrouble, because my mom was too lazy to figure out how to deal with  <br/>\nproblems in a compassionate way.  She just yelled, spanked, and  <br/>\ngrounded people, and then muttered and complained until she calmed  <br/>\ndown.  So my sister figured telling about that would get her in a  <br/>\nWHOLE lot of trouble with my mom, and then increased trouble with the  <br/>\ncousin.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps this came to mind because yesterday my sister (who is 53)  <br/>\ncalled to say that Nadine (who is 54) became a great grandmother last  <br/>\nweek.

But the important *unschooling* question is, does that  <br/>\naction get understood in the way you intend? Do the kids feel  <br/>\nconfident your goal is to help them? Do they feel through seeing your  <br/>\nmethod of problem solving that they&#39;ve gained a little more insight on  <br/>\nhow to solve conflicts between them and between others? Would you like  <br/>\nthem to adopt the model you&#39;ve used in conflicts with their friends?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In my home, a child could hit or push me *once*, and then I would  <br/>\n&gt; take action to stop that immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So would a radical unschooler. But *why* are you stopping it? To teach  <br/>\nthem not to hit? To teach them hitting is not acceptable?<br/>\n<br/>\nKids do need the information that hitting isn&#39;t appropriate (in  <br/>\nwhatever inappropriate situation they&#39;ve used it in). (Though we don&#39;t  <br/>\nnecessarily need to tell them. Our actions redirecting them to better  <br/>\nways can say it clearly to most people.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere a respectful approach deviates from conventional parenting is  <br/>\nthat it should *NOT* be assumed that because kids are hitting that  <br/>\nthey either 1) don&#39;t know it&#39;s bad or are 2) deliberately making the  <br/>\nbad choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nA view point that helps parents see more helpful and respectful ways  <br/>\nto respond is to assume a child is always doing the best they can in  <br/>\nthe moment and they need help to do better. A child may know hitting  <br/>\nisn&#39;t a good choice, but in the moment -- tired, hungry, frustrated --  <br/>\nthe direct route is right there and the more complex route is foggy  <br/>\nand uncertain.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most important question is: &quot;What led up to it? What did I miss?  <br/>\nWhat could I do differently next time to defuse the build up that led  <br/>\nto it?&quot; The more a parent can prevent, the more energy and patience  <br/>\nthere is for the unexpected.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Onto the couch to hit the couch cushions, into a same-room time out,  <br/>\n&gt; into time out in their room, asked to run 10 laps around the  <br/>\n&gt; swingset in the back yard.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To be helpful in a situation, a person should focus on meeting the  <br/>\nneed. If a child has hit because they&#39;re full of energy and need to  <br/>\nexpend it, mom should shift the atmosphere to something more  <br/>\nenergetic. (Better is becoming aware of the signals of a build up and  <br/>\nredirecting sooner.) If a child has hit because they&#39;re hungry, food  <br/>\nwill help. (Better is being aware of the time and learning signs of  <br/>\nhunger and bring out food before the &quot;STARVING!&quot; alarm goes off. If a  <br/>\nchild has hit because she&#39;s reached the end of her rope with another  <br/>\nchild, the mom can redirect to change the dynamic. (Better, of course,  <br/>\nis learning the signs of the build up and redirecting sooner.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo withdrawing, punching a pillow, running around, could be tools mom  <br/>\nsuggests might help (depending on personality, the reason), but using  <br/>\nthem as punishment won&#39;t help someone learn better approaches to  <br/>\nsolving differences.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I would never in any situation allow a child to hit me repeatedly,  <br/>\n&gt; because in that case, in my mind, what I&#39;m teaching is that physical  <br/>\n&gt; violence is an acceptable way to attempt to resolve problems between  <br/>\n&gt; human beings.

He doesn&#39;t want lectures on  <br/>\nsomeone&#39;s values. He wants a way to solve a problem that&#39;s confounding  <br/>\nhim.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps unschooling moms *greatly* to assume kids don&#39;t want to hurt  <br/>\nothers or damage things but are having trouble figuring out how to  <br/>\nmeet their need without doing that.

The toy goes away. (I move it too high to reach, or into a space where it&#39;s not available.) I don&#39;t care to make any effort to judge &quot;who started it&quot; or &quot;who was more out of line&quot;. To me, if I play that game, I&#39;m in a negative conversation loop, where the children are vying to think of stories that will impress me more. And I truly don&#39;t care (if one child or the other started it). <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience, what this teaches include: <br/>\n--mom is reliable - she gives the toy back<br/>\n--not resolving a way to use the toy together results in both/all of us losing it, so it motivates the kids to resolve things before that point. Not that they always will, and none of us are perfect, so that&#39;s to be expected.<br/>\n--we survived when the toy disappeared, which gives perspective on how important it seemed at the time when each of us wanted to use it differently.<br/>\n--etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this seems not very unschoolish an approach, I apologize. I really do have positive goals in mind when I do this, it isn&#39;t meant to punish, it is meant to &quot;change the scenery&quot;, as it were. It is also more positive for me to time the *toy* out, than to time the *child* out. <br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, regards the incident you described where your 4.5 year old daughter was repeatedly hitting you, &quot;...where she is pushing me, running into me, hitting me, just fighting with everything she has to get the door.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my favorite quotes is: &quot;If you&#39;re not doing what you&#39;re teaching, maybe you&#39;re teaching something else.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my home, a child could hit or push me *once*, and then I would take action to stop that immediately. Onto the couch to hit the couch cushions, into a same-room time out, into time out in their room, asked to run 10 laps around the swingset in the back yard. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would never in any situation allow a child to hit me repeatedly,  because in that case, in my mind, what I&#39;m teaching is that physical violence is an acceptable way to attempt to resolve problems between human beings. And to me, it is not.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1509055,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning]","postDate":"1013186125","msgId":4471,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAyMDIwODA4MzM1MC4wMjdmNzZlMEBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMTYwMWMxYjBiNCQzN2NmMDMwMCRlYjg5ODUwYUBwYXZpbGlvbj4=","referencesHeader":"PDEwMTMxNDc4ODguMjY5MC43NzUyNS5tM0B5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4450,"nextInTopic":55448,"prevInTime":4470,"nextInTime":4472,"topicId":4442,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
