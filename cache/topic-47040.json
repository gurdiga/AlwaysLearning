Boating encourages a different<br/>\nform of self-reliance and confidence in children than land living<br/>\ndoes. On land, if Rowan (who is 7) tries to drive the car, people are<br/>\nnervous, but if he drives the boat (which he does regularly) he is<br/>\nroundly encouraged by the other boaters. On land, when he picks up<br/>\npower tools, people get nervous, but around boats, people ask &quot;can<br/>\nRowan come help us fetch tools when we&#39;re working?&quot; Those are just<br/>\nexamples. I think the root of it is that in a boat environment, kids<br/>\nare integrated into the working of the home in a way that land<br/>\ndwellers of any age are not, so they pick up many more skills with<br/>\nregards to keeping the water out, the people in, and the boat moving<br/>\nforward, than land kids in houses do. It&#39;s just a question of context.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve learned, over the years, is to let people have their own<br/>\nfears, and to try to just pass the bean dip. Land people have all<br/>\nkinds of fears of boats, oceans, water, and eventually it gets really<br/>\nbothersome to have accepted a different kind of risk in my parenting.<br/>\nIf people press, I usually reply with something like &quot;y&#39;know, in a<br/>\nhouse, you have electrical plugs, heavy things on shelves and in high<br/>\ncabinets, hot water from taps and unsecured on stoves, power lines,<br/>\nstreets, trees, and neighbors, all of which are proven dangerous to<br/>\nchildren in some context.

Is it an unassisted solo<br/>\ncircumnavigation, or thoroughly assisted, as most circumnavigations<br/>\n(of any age) are these days? What&#39;s her intended route? What&#39;s her<br/>\nintended schedule? What&#39;s her boat&#39;s setup? There is a lot of fine<br/>\ndetail there that completely changes, from a sailing perspective,<br/>\nwhether this might be a good idea or a total disaster. And it&#39;s all<br/>\ncompletely independent of age.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery year, adults with little to no experience but plenty of cash buy<br/>\nboats and head out around the world.

There are many times I hesitate, think over a request, make a decision.  As an example, my son went without training wheels on his 2 wheel bike for the first time 2 weeks ago, and he immediately wanted to make a 3 mile bike ride with us that involved hills and major streets (5.75 y/o).  We said no, suggested riding the bike around the neighborhood first to build up confidence and for us to assess his skills, talk about traffic safety and road rules.  1.5 weeks later we made the ride to the park and he did fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s my point.  We assessed his skills, made sure he could do it, and we did it together.  Were he older, I would assess his ability to follow traffic laws, make decisions about crossing the busy streets safely, and once I thought he could do that he would be free to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n==I&#39;m feeling ignored.

I do not know if she will be totally on her own at all times.  While sailing, yes.  But in port will she have a parent meet her?  Or another adult?  Will they shadow her for a bit to make sure she can handle customs, provisioning, repairs?  I do not know these details and cannot address them.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling to me means being responsive to my child and his needs and desires.  Being respectful of him as a person, and not dismissing something simply because of age.

I live in the Netherlands and have been following this story for some time.<br/>\nIn Dutch news and discussions on the internet, a lot of people focus on the fact that she will miss school and that that is a very very very bad thing in their opinion. Even members of parliament have made statements about this.<br/>\nAs I understand the ruling of earlier this week, the judges explicitly said that Laura&#39;s parents didn&#39;t do anything wrong. The judges approved of the fact that her parents had tried to dissuade her from her plans. Now child protection services have to prove she is not capable of this trip, if they can&#39;t she can go in october.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe legal problems she&#39;s in now are partly caused by the fact that she was picked up by British child protection services after she arrived in Lowestoft (UK) by herself. They alerted Dutch child protection services. And then Laura&#39;s parents applied to the &#39;leerplichtambtenaar&#39; (government official who decides if you can take your child out of school or not), but used the wrong article in the law. They used an article that most homeschoolers in the Netherlands use, but it would have been better to use another one that lets children quit school to subscribe to a distance learning program. Since this is what Laura is planning to do, this is what they should have used.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that homeschooling in the Netherlands is difficult enough as it is, we definitely could do without all this negative publicity. There is no Dutch law that discusses homeschooling. We only have laws that say that children have to go to school. There are three exceptions: if they are physically or mentally unable to go to school, if there isn&#39;t a school within 20 km of the same religion of the family (this is the exception that almost all Dutch homeschoolers use), or if the child will use a distance learning program.<br/>\nI took my son out of school three months after he started when he was four yo (normal age in the Netherlands to start school). I now have a 50% change of having to go to court to be able to homeschool. (If Dutch officials ever found out anything about unschooling, they would not like it. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is the reason why the Dutch media are making such a big deal out of the Laura case. Not only because what she wants to do is dangerous, but mainly because not going to school is considered very extreme in the Netherlands.

My answer is that we shouldn&#39;t abandon our better judgment <br/>\n(better than a 7 year old, probably better than a 13 year old) under the <br/>\nbanner of &quot;supporting their interests.&quot; Her interest in sailing around <br/>\nthe world could be supported by her sailing with someone else, rather <br/>\nthan alone, for example. The only reason for doing it alone is to beat <br/>\nsome record for being the youngest, and I&#39;m saying that THAT doesn&#39;t <br/>\nseem (to me, of course, to me - do I really need to keep saying that?) <br/>\nlike a good enough reason to take such an extraordinary risk.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 8/29/2009 5:31 AM, Robin Krest wrote:<br/>\n&gt; But we don&#39;t know this girl, or her family.

Granted, there are risks involved, but driving a car has risks as well.  A well maintained sailboat is sturdy and safe; awareness of weather windows and storm patterns reduces the risk of weather related issues (One long time cruising couple estimated they spent only about 1% of their sailing time dealing with bad weather); sailboats move slowly enough you can avoid most collisions quite easily if you are prepared to alter your course and not expect the other person to do so (seriously, there are rules of the road in sailing, but you should never expect the other person knows and follows them).  People with NO experience with sailing go cruising quite often, and are fine.  This girl has experience.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Thanks.  Someone sent the info on the side too, and I remember now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question is whether the government should have prevented the  <br/>\nparents from allowing that, or whether a school should be able to  <br/>\n&quot;forbid&quot; a child (or teen) from participating in an international  <br/>\nmusic or sports performance or event.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd another question is about what are they afraid of.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then we start to get into drawing lines for where the government should have the authority to step in.  Stop them from traveling with the orchestra?  But trains and planes and buses crash, will there be enough chaperones, what if the kids sneak out and something happens?  Should girls be allowed to participate in gymnastics on an Olympic level?  We know the long term damage that this intense sport can cause to the body, she may catch her head wrong and be paralyzed or die, so let&#39;s say no.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf we look at any activity from the fear based side, we can almost always find a reason to say no.  But if the person is prepared, has experience, and wants to undertake the adventure, why say no?  Will you prevent or force your teen from learning to drive?  Or will you follow their lead and help them be prepared for the judgment and skills and maturity necessary to operate a car?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been doing a little more reading about her.  I cannot find the original source of info yet (still looking) but on the Free Range website there is a discussion about this, and one comment says: &quot;Dekker has already done the shorter but still lengthy solo journeys people are suggesting here and thus, also, her ability to be alone for more than a day at a time has already been tested. She has spent seven weeks sailing the Atlantic alone previously.

She was 7 <br/>\nyears old and she and her father and instructor all died in a plane <br/>\ncrash. She was attempting to be the youngest person to fly across the <br/>\nUS. Her father was in the back seat, a flying instructor was next to <br/>\nJessica in the plane. Jessica was flying. The weather was bad, but they <br/>\ndecided to go anyway because they had news media waiting, and she <br/>\ncrashed after takeoff. In interviews, her mother talked about allowing <br/>\nher to &quot;follow her bliss,&quot; which was a popular expression at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt brought some very negative attention to homeschoolers for a while and <br/>\nthere was talk of legislation, but nothing came of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t understand or agree with trying to set records of being the <br/>\nyoungest to do things. If a kid loves flying, support that love in ways <br/>\nthat are reasonable - in Jessica Dubroff&#39;s case, the father had made it <br/>\ninto a huge publicity thing - a 7 year old flying coast-to-coast. There <br/>\nwere many ways that her love of flying could have been supported other <br/>\nthan that kind of media pressure that led to them choosing to fly in bad <br/>\nweather.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame thing with this 13 year old who wants to take 2 years to sail alone <br/>\naround the world.
