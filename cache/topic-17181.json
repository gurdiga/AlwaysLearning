I&#39;ve been <br/>\n  busy and I&#39;ve put her off, which I shouldn&#39;t do especially now when she is at <br/>\n  a difficult time in her life. I&#39;m having surgery in just over a week and so I <br/>\n  need to set one up soon. So tell Holly and Caitlin and Alyssa and any others <br/>\n  interested I will attempt to set one up sometime this week. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:GirlOracle@...\">GirlOracle@...</a><br/>\n  ~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
