Today I was<br/>\n&gt; cleaning out my purse and found some state quarters so<br/>\n&gt; we got out the state quarter books to see which ones<br/>\n&gt; we needed which led to me getting out the lincoln<br/>\n&gt; penny book to see if we needed any of the pennies we<br/>\n&gt; found, which led to me getting the bag of $2 bills, $1<br/>\n&gt; coins, etc. out and found money from Scotland from<br/>\n&gt; when my husband was stationed over there and I decided<br/>\n&gt; that we should do sort of a unit study and get<br/>\n&gt; currency from as many countries as we can and compare<br/>\n&gt; to values to US currency.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I feel so blessed that we live in a time that this is<br/>\n&gt; so widely accepted (with the exception of<br/>\n&gt; closed-minded people like my in-laws and some of my<br/>\n&gt; closer relatives who believe that all children should<br/>\n&gt; be in &quot;school&quot;)  I feel even more blessed that we have<br/>\n&gt; &quot;unschooling&quot; because my children fight me on anything<br/>\n&gt; that resembles &quot;school&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; Cheryl<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11751,"nextTopicId":11760}}
