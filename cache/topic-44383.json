They offer  <br/>\nto help each other.  They ask for assistance, or special skills  <br/>\nhelp.   Marty&#39;s very mechanical and can create and creatively repair.   <br/>\nHolly&#39;s artistic and gives good advice about clothes and hair which  <br/>\nthe boys don&#39;t need much, but when they do they go straight to Holly.   <br/>\nWhen they want interpersonal advice they call Kirby.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Holly was little she was better in some ways at math than the  <br/>\nboys were, even then (and none of them are slouches at all).  She  <br/>\ncould read an analog clock before Kirby and Marty could.  She could  <br/>\nfigure money out quickly (and nowadays in both her jobs she handles  <br/>\ncash and cards and discounts and coupons and specials and all kinds of  <br/>\nstuff without batting an eye).  When they&#39;re out with money, from the  <br/>\ntime they were little to now, it was not unusual for them to pool, or  <br/>\nto ask one person to keep all the money and then figure out who still  <br/>\nhad what when they got home.

It could have been a snarkfest,  <br/>\nbut no, the story they were telling is that she&#39;s inconsiderate about  <br/>\ntipping, and the new boyfriend backs her up; if she decides not to tip  <br/>\nat a restaurant, he won&#39;t either, even when they&#39;re in a group, which  <br/>\nmakes the whole group look bad and the wait staff has no idea who  <br/>\n&quot;didn&#39;t tip,&quot; so it results in just shorting the group she&#39;s with  <br/>\nrather than insulting the waitress.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey know each other&#39;s strengths and they&#39;re philosophical about  <br/>\nwhat&#39;s involved in being a good person.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Comparisons was Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: homemade side walk paint???","postDate":"1241008242","msgId":44422,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM2RENEQzkxLUY5RTgtNDI4NS1BRkM1LUVBNTM4Njc4N0NFOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEE4MEJBQkExRDIwNzQ0QjE5OTkzN0U1OUQ4ODM1OENFQFJvYnluUEM+","referencesHeader":"PGd0N2RsaitlOGZyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8RjFCNEQ3MDItRkJENi00OTI2LTg5QjItMkE1MjU1NDY2QjgxQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8NDlGNzVDOEMuOTAwMDgwOUBtYWMuY29tPiA8NjkzODA4LjIzNzcwLnFtQHdlYjExMTIwNi5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+IDxFOTRGRTRCRC0zRUIzLTRFMjQtQkUyQi0zMzE5NDg1RTU1QkRAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDwyOTE4NzQuNTYyODEucW1Ad2ViMTExMjEyLm1haWwuZ3ExLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPEE4MEJBQkExRDIwNzQ0QjE5OTkzN0U1OUQ4ODM1OENFQFJvYnluUEM+"},"prevInTopic":44420,"nextInTopic":44423,"prevInTime":44421,"nextInTime":44423,"topicId":44383,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- I personally have witnessed this time and again.

If self-comparison is something that <br/>\noccurs amongst unschooling siblings, in the absence of school attendance, <br/>\nthen it seems illogical to blame school for that particular event. We all <br/>\nknow that schools create and encourage all kinds of effects, beliefs, <br/>\nself-image issues, peer issues including comparison and competition - <br/>\navoiding those negative characteristics of school is one of the reason we <br/>\nunschool.

But something that I have noticed, in a very striking <br/>\nway at conferences, is how mutually supportive unschooling siblings often <br/>\nappear. This is especially noticeable as they get a bit older - teens and <br/>\nnearly teens. I personally have witnessed this time and again.

This along with avoiding the kind of labelling <br/>\nconventional parents will do all unthinkingly and humorously - &quot;this one is <br/>\nour clever kid, but her sister is our athlete&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe story didn&#39;t strike me as Rosie comparing herself to Roxana in a <br/>\ncompetitive way, but just that she hadn&#39;t considered Roxana might be <br/>\ninterested in the gig until Pam thought of it.
