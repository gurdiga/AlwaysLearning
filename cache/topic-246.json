Basically,<br/>\nwe just sat around and discussed lit and at the end of the term we were<br/>\nsupposed to write a paper.  True to form, I waited until after Thanksgiving<br/>\nto even think about the paper.  I picked a poem by John Donne, thinking<br/>\nsurely nobody reads this guy.<br/>\n<br/>\nTurns out my professor did his dissertation on Donne  :(<br/>\n<br/>\nHe wrote across my paper  &quot;You completely missed the point...B-&quot;.  I<br/>\nunderstood that he liked my writing well enough to pass me but thought I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t understand the poem.  I found it a challenge, learned more about<br/>\nDonne and found out that hey I like to read this guy.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":244,"nextTopicId":1}}
