What is a Dads&#39; Weekend? Well we&#39;re not really <br/>\nsure.  The Dads in NE TN had an idea to rent a cabin in the <br/>\nbeautiful mountains of TN and just hang out, talk about being an <br/>\nunschooling Dad, how it&#39;s going, maybe some drinking, card games, <br/>\ncycling, nerf gun tag (Scotty&#39;s fave)â€¦whatever we all wanted to do.  <br/>\nAs the word spread, more and more Dads showed an interest so we <br/>\ndecided to invite all Dads.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccommodations:<br/>\nEach cabin has 1 queen and 2 twin beds.  With blow-up beds on the <br/>\nliving room floor the cabins sleep 4-6.  Each cabin has a full <br/>\nkitchen with plates, cups, etc and costs $114 a night. (Divided by 4 <br/>\nnot bad)  There are no TVs or phones.  Wireless internet is a ten <br/>\nminute walk to the main building.  You will need to bring all your <br/>\nown food and drink for the weekend.  The closest town in 20 minutes <br/>\naway.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoan Mountain<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tennessee.gov/environment/parks/RoanMtn/\">http://www.tennessee.gov/environment/parks/RoanMtn/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are interested email me directly at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Austin@...\">Austin@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPlease pass this email on to every list of unschooling folks.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\n<br/>\nAustin Gavin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41911,"nextTopicId":41940}}
