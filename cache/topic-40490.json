The book we bought at the same time said that &quot;if we can <br/>\neat it, hamsters can eat it&quot;. With the exception of the timothy hay, which <br/>\nwould be plain ruffage/fiber and probably go straight through, most of the <br/>\nstuff in our hamsters feed is the same nuts, grains and seeds that you see <br/>\nin a trail mix - some of it pelletised. However it&#39;s probably slightly lower <br/>\ngrades of nuts, grains and seeds, unless you are buying organically grown. <br/>\nYou could make up a trail mix from raw ingredients, and btw it would be fine <br/>\nfor the hammy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would have this advice about the snacks. First, give him his own snack <br/>\nbowl at his eye level so that he doesn&#39;t have to go into the pets&#39; bowls - <br/>\nthat could be be unhygenic especially if you hammy is anything like our <br/>\nShimmer. Also read the ingredients and check the country of origin. TBH I <br/>\nwould be far more worried about food with ingredients from China after all <br/>\nthis recent business with Melamine, than the ingredients themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember hearing about a food scientist asked what single food he would <br/>\n&quot;take on a desert island&quot; to survive and be healthy and he said canned cat <br/>\nfood, because it contained all the proteins, fats, carbs and vitamins that <br/>\nare needed. I&#39;ll have to search out the reference. I think it was a radio <br/>\nprogram.

I have some ideas but  <br/>\nI&#39;ll let others go first.   I&#39;m getting behind on dishes and laundry  <br/>\nand all, and didn&#39;t want this to wait.  It&#39;s a quote from here down:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a cat, some fish and a hamster.  My 5yo son likes to eat  <br/>\ntheir food.  His interest started with cat treats about five months  <br/>\nago.  I let him have a few, thinking he&#39;d eat one or two and let it  <br/>\ngo, but he kept asking for them.  I would give them to him, but my  <br/>\nhusband felt very uncomfortable after researching the ingredients in  <br/>\nthe treats we had.  So we told my son that the treats were made for  <br/>\ncats, and might make a person sick to eat too many, and stopped  <br/>\nletting him have them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoon after that he wanted to sample the fish food, and again I gave  <br/>\nit to him once or twice before becoming uncomfortable with it, and  <br/>\ntold him again that it was made for fish, not for people.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen he started eating the cat food, and the ingredients in it didn&#39;t  <br/>\nworry us as much as the treats or the fish food, so we&#39;d give it to  <br/>\nhim when he asked.  Then he asked in front of our babysitter, and I  <br/>\nwas embarrassed.  I gave it to him, but later told him that people  <br/>\nthink it&#39;s gross and he should only have it when we don&#39;t have  <br/>\nvisitors.  I was hoping his want for cat food would go away, and it&#39;s  <br/>\ndecreased, but he still likes to eat it.  He&#39;ll walk by the cat dish  <br/>\nand munch on a few every now and then.  I&#39;d like for him not to eat  <br/>\npet food.  But I don&#39;t want to create a situation where he&#39;s sneaking  <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now he wants to eat our hamster food, which is seeds and grains  <br/>\nand nuts.  It kind of grosses me out, and my husband is very  <br/>\nuncomfortable with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what to do ... I&#39;ve bought him seeds and nuts from the  <br/>\ngrocery store, but he doesn&#39;t like those the same way he likes the  <br/>\nhamster food.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d love suggestions - this is one of those things where I don&#39;t  <br/>\nhonestly think our cat or hamster food would be harmful for him, but  <br/>\nit&#39;s not socially accepted to eat pet food.  My in-laws in particular  <br/>\nwould be mortified if they knew we had allowed this.  And even if I  <br/>\nsaid no if he asked for it while they were here, the question in and  <br/>\nof itself would indicate that we have allowed it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I&#39;d like to add to the thank you&#39;s you&#39;ve gotten around the  <br/>\nseventh anniversary of this list.  I love this list, and am grateful  <br/>\nthat you maintain it and post so much.  I really hope to meet you in  <br/>\nperson someday.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40542,"nextTopicId":40361}}
