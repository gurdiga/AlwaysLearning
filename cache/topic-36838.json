She comes across lots of mentors<br/>\nwho help her mature as a witch.<br/>\n    Other titles are Nausica of the Valley of the Wind.

It is<br/>\nabout changing your lifestyle, as well.<br/>\n    Three other favorites are &quot;Howl&#39;s Moving Castle&quot;, &quot;Castle in The<br/>\nSky&quot;, and &quot;Spirted Away&quot;.
