We watched the Holy Grail. They thought it was<br/>\nokay, my older son (almost 11) laughed and got more of the humor than my<br/>\nyounger son - Jonathan (9). DH (being a MP fan) was narrating and explaining<br/>\nthe various scenes that came up. And I think because he was cracking up at<br/>\ncertain parts, my kids knew that it was a funny part and they tried to find<br/>\nthe humor in it. They liked the killer white bunny (because we have a mean<br/>\nwhite bunny). But at the end, when it abruptly ended with the untimely<br/>\narrests, Jonathan declared that in his opinion, Spongebob Squarepants was<br/>\nmuch funnier and this was a stupid movie. BUT, I checked out The Life of<br/>\nBrian (on DVD!) and we&#39;re watching that, next!<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zenmomma@...\">zenmomma@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; I found this site while I was searching around for something else.
