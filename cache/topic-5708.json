They don&#39;t have to be &quot;educational&quot; or weighty <br/>\nor &quot;classical.&quot;  We&#39;ve gotten some great insights and connections from the <br/>\nsilliest and goofiest stuff.  One non-goofy example though:<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby was into a kind of Shakespeare phase a couple of years ago, and I <br/>\nrented the Romeo+Juliet with the guns.  I watched some with him, and I was <br/>\nfolding laundry and this and that, in and out.

He said &quot;No, it&#39;s good.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he watched it to the end, with rapt attention.  And we discussed it off <br/>\nand on in little spurts for the next couple of days.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":49413852,"authorName":"Dawn Falbe","from":"&quot;Dawn Falbe&quot; &lt;dawn@...&gt;","profile":"astrologerdawn","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Doing things I like to do","postDate":"1016751801","msgId":5708,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNjkwMWMxZDEyYyQ5OTdmMmY2MCRkMThlZGQxOEBhei5zcHJpbnRiYmQubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":5715,"prevInTime":5707,"nextInTime":5709,"topicId":5708,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have wanted to see Apollo 13 for a while and finally I listened to what many of your unschoolers have said since I joined this list; do something you want to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-931873833\">I have wanted to see Apollo 13 for a while and finally I listened to what<br/>\nmany of your unschoolers have said since I joined this list; do something<br/>\nyou want to do and see what happens.... Well Max was down for a nap and I<br/>\ntold Zak the movie I was going to watch and what it was about.  He sat with<br/>\nme for about 1 1/2 hour of the movie (that much took me nearly 3 hours to<br/>\nwatch as I had to stop and start it every few minutes to answer<br/>\nquestions)... I always thought I was a mind of useless information... I know<br/>\na little about a lot of different things...  I didn&#39;t know I knew so much<br/>\nabout the space mission, considering I would have been 11 at the time and<br/>\nlived in England, and I don&#39;t think I even knew anything about America<br/>\naccept that it was the place we sent felons too (or was that Austrailia)...<br/>\n(You can tell how much I listened in school).... Anyway I digress....  It<br/>\nwas wonderful to sit with my first born and answer his questions as he fired<br/>\nthem at me one after the other....  After he&#39;d finished watching he built a<br/>\nspaceship in the living room, using jelly beans for the controls (which of<br/>\ncourse he eventually ate)... He then branched out and built a more elaborate<br/>\none in the garden and we all had to come and ride on the space ship.  It<br/>\nhappened to be a very cold day in Tucson (if that&#39;s possible) and so he gave<br/>\nus blankets to keep up warm and toasty...  I was going to suggest a hot<br/>\ntoddy but decided 4pm was probably not the time for that (LOL.... just a<br/>\njoke we don&#39;t drink)....  We talked about going to different planets and who<br/>\nhad walked on the moon, about another movie Mission to Mars that Zak caught<br/>\na glimse of, how many planets, their astrological significance and their<br/>\nastronomy significance...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a wonderful experience it was and all because I decided to do something<br/>\nthat I&#39;m interested in....<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to watch Spartacus, rent the video or DVD, and put it in and<br/>\nwatch it!
