I have a baby sister... no, we go out<br/>\nand do stuff...<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has found a different doctor but I don&#39;t know that she&#39;d ever<br/>\nquestions this one as to why he asked such questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am really wondering now if this happens a lot to homeschoolers.  To<br/>\nevery kid the doctor gets alone?  Public school kids too?  Or just<br/>\nhomeschoolers because they&#39;re &quot;isolationists&quot; or some other unpleasant<br/>\nthing?<br/>\nI still think it&#39;s creepy.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had something similar happen the last time I took my kids in.  Our<br/>\nnew Dr. was very concerned that my 7yo ds couldn&#39;t tie his shoes (well<br/>\nwhy should he, he either wears clogs or pull-on shoes).  He was also<br/>\nconcerned that ds couldn&#39;t read yet (we, his parents, are not<br/>\nconcerned).  The Dr. was very vocal about this, while ignoring the fact<br/>\nthat my then 4yo dd could read and could tie her shoes (she learned<br/>\nbecause she wanted to know).<br/>\n<br/>\nHe started handing me pamphlets after he found out we homeschooled, on<br/>\nthings like nutrition, what children should know at the end of<br/>\nkindergarten, how important socialization is (I think they meant<br/>\nsocializing), etc...  I looked at the pamphlets in my hand and asked him<br/>\nif he gave these to all parents or just the homeschooling ones.  His<br/>\nanswer?  Just the homeschooling ones, they don&#39;t seem to have enough<br/>\ninformation or resources.  While he was still in the room in tipped all<br/>\nthe pamphlets into the large trash can.  I&#39;m not sure we&#39;re going back<br/>\nto him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIgnorance abounds, even in the medical community.<br/>\n<br/>\nKate<br/>\nWho&#39;s father is a Dr. and very supportive of unschooling</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9605,"nextTopicId":9673}}
