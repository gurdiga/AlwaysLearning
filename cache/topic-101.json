Eventually my husband <br/>\ncaught on that we weren&#39;t really doing anything systematic or structured  - <br/>\nand either he&#39;s realized that the kids are clearly doing just fine or he&#39;s <br/>\njust given up in order to preserve family peace - but he seems to realize <br/>\nthat they&#39;re learning and that it doesn&#39;t really matter if they learn <br/>\nspecific things at specific times.

It is worse than counterproductive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is &quot;algebraic thinking&quot; - that is fine -- kids do it pretty naturally <br/>\nanyway and it can be really satisfying and fun -- and there are ways for <br/>\nparents who aren&#39;t skilled in this area to encourage it in their children, <br/>\nbut that is VERY different than formal algebra studied in a systematic, <br/>\nstandard way. I have super strong opinions that that is a major mistake to <br/>\nstart early. I&#39;d try to find other mathematical things to do even for a kid <br/>\nwho was WANTING to study algebra -- there are so MANY other areas to explore <br/>\nthat are so much more appropriate and that a younger kid will get so much <br/>\nmore out of. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou know - we could probably flood this list with suggestions for math <br/>\nprograms -- and I&#39;d, personally, probably enjoy it -- but I have to admit it <br/>\nfeels odd to do it here. Incongruent and risky (to use a couple of great math <br/>\nterms &lt;BEG&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m always skittish about recommending stuff and having it be interpreted as <br/>\nme recommending that parents pick a program and make the kids do it. Although <br/>\nI&#39;ve spent a lot of time looking at math resources, I think it is better, <br/>\ntruly BETTER, for a kid to do NO formal math if it is parent-pushed. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, I always worry, too, about the fact that so many adults <br/>\nhave math anxiety/issues/phobias/hatred/fears/etc. that even unschooling <br/>\nparents will, inadvertently, pass their own feelings along to their kids <br/>\nwithout even realizing it. Kids aren&#39;t going to be following up on math stuff <br/>\nthat they might otherwise be interested in if they get negative vibes from <br/>\ntheir parents -- math anxiety (generated by the way schools teach math) is <br/>\noften manifested in avoidance -- people don&#39;t necessarily admit they have <br/>\nmath anxiety, they just go through life always avoiding math. Kids might pick <br/>\nup on it being something to avoid. So sometimes I start thinking that a <br/>\nreally fun satisfying math program might be better than that --  since at <br/>\nleast the kids will have exposure and therefore the opportunity to get into <br/>\nmath if that is their inclination.<br/>\n<br/>\nANyway -- I&#39;ve let myself get off the topic. <br/>\nYes -- I&#39;ll come up with some ideas for math programs that involve <br/>\ninvestigation and exploration.
