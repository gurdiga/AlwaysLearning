Your idea of breaking things<br/>\ninto manageable chunks is a great one.  I haven&#39;t been tuned into her<br/>\nfrustration in this way yet, but I bet it will help.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that has helped with respect to her frustrations over art is for<br/>\nus to explore abstract art together.  Somehow she can be more forgiving of<br/>\nher own representation of a hat, for example, if she has seen that<br/>\n&quot;professional&quot; artists purposefully make things not look right.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I happen to have an idea about the wave... I don&#39;t remember the title<br/>\nof the book, but recently someone wrote a book about how the classic<br/>\nartists used mirrors to exactly represent their drawings.  This is also<br/>\nsomething that I&#39;ve done in art classes.  To some it may seem like<br/>\ncheating, but if you read how the classic artists used the techniques, then<br/>\nyou are just following in some very great footsteps.  Anyway, the use of<br/>\nmirrors would allow your son to sort of trace the wave, or other artwork.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNamaste<br/>\n--bc--<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":92314408,"authorName":"atwttmab@aol.com","from":"atwttmab@...","profile":"lyndamhoward","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: hello from me ;-)","postDate":"1064063544","msgId":16364,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZEMkM1QTVBLjE5Q0VCRTNDLjAwNjZBODg4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":16363,"nextInTopic":16368,"prevInTime":16363,"nextInTime":16365,"topicId":16362,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I wrote: The only fly in the ointment seems to be he s hesitant to do anything that takes a large dose of determination.

That ended in slamming down of pencils & getting really frustrated that he couldn&#39;t get the wave to look just the way he wanted it to look.  He seems to see what other people, experts in their field, have produced and wants to be able to emulate them; but he doesn&#39;t seem to grasp that they probably didn&#39;t get it *right* first time.

YOu are all fantastic inspiration for the sticky moments when things are hard work.

THANK YOU!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the main reason for my post is that I wanted to pick your brains about my eldest. He&#39;s 10yo & has been out of school for coming up to a year & a half now.

He&#39;s happy to try anything, but if it doesn&#39;t come easily to him he gets frustrated & gives up. I&#39;m not looking for suggestions for how to make him do anything; because that&#39;s his choice, but I&#39;d like ideas for how to help him not get so frustrated so that he&#39;ll feel able to carry on trying until he gets where he wants to be. Having been in school seems to have given him a reluctance to &#39;fail&#39; which hasn&#39;t worn off yet. We&#39;ve talked about the idea that he&#39;s not failing, just hasn&#39;t succeeded yet. Part of the problem is that he sets himself really high goals, but doesn&#39;t seem to want to go through the learning curve to get there. Well I think I&#39;ve waffled on for quite long enough now!
