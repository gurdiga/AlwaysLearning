I agree with what you say.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I nurse modestly because I want<br/>\nothers to see that it can be done, not<br/>\nbecause I dont&#39; want to offend people.  I<br/>\nthink that if a soon to be mom or her husband<br/>\nor MIL or mother or someone saw me nursing<br/>\nwith it all hanging out, they might think<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;ll never be able to nurse if I have to<br/>\nnurse like that, so I just won&#39;t try, or  I<br/>\nwon&#39;t nurse in public, or I&#39;ll pump and give<br/>\npumped milk in public in a bottle, or formula<br/>\nin public, etc.&quot;  But if they see me nursing<br/>\ndiscreetly, then maybe they will say &quot;hmm,<br/>\nthat mom is nursing and I dind&#39;t even know it<br/>\nuntil I got close, no one can see a thing,<br/>\nmaybe I can nurse like that too...&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut to be honest, it has nothing to do with<br/>\nbeing worried about being offensive to<br/>\nsomeone else.  I realized when I was going<br/>\nout with my husband that I can&#39;t worry about<br/>\nother&#39;s people&#39;s feelings. I can try not to<br/>\noffend people, but I&#39;ll only take it so far.<br/>\nSome people in this crazy world are offended<br/>\njust by us going out in public together,<br/>\nbecause he is black and I am white.  Some<br/>\npeople are offended (like my uncle, who is a<br/>\npediatric doctor) when I nurse in public, no<br/>\nmatter how discreet I am.  I personally don&#39;t<br/>\ncare about their offense.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut really, I was thinking this statement was<br/>\nlike me telling Lexie to &quot;be careful&quot; when<br/>\nshe&#39;s pooring the milk or crossing the<br/>\nstreet.  Of course she&#39;s careful, why woudl<br/>\nshe not be.  it&#39;s more like it&#39;s belittling.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 1/11/02 5:05:27 PM,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joylyn@...\">joylyn@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; I mean, would we say &quot;as a gesture of<br/>\n&gt; respect<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; towards others, please cover up all holes<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; your body (except for one hole in each ear)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; and all tatoos.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes, in a way and under certain<br/>\n&gt; circumstances.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At a formal wedding, tattoos showing<br/>\n&gt; through the lace on bridesmaids could be<br/>\n&gt; problematical.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t want to see anyone&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; below-the-waist holes in ANY hotel (unless<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; in a room alone with the door locked,<br/>\n&gt; consenting adults and all that).<br/>\n&gt; Picking noses and cleaning ears in public<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t politely done.
