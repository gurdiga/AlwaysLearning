All kids have<br/>\ntalents, schools only recognize and encourage some of them.  Your<br/>\ndaughter would be a perfect example.  Artists of any kind, in schools,<br/>\nare a bit marginalized, even if the schools recognize the talent.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can say, from my own experience, that school did more harm than good<br/>\nfor my art exploration.  I learned far more from my dad, than from any<br/>\nclassroom art class.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest daughter, and even me, come to think of it, have been accused<br/>\nof living in a fantasy world.  Well, why not live in my own world?  Why<br/>\nnot indulge myself in this regard?  It doesn&#39;t harm anyone.  The only<br/>\nharm has come from trying to ignore it, my own self exploration, to do<br/>\nwhat others see best.  No good can come from that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter hasn&#39;t had to undo any of the damage that comes from<br/>\nignoring herself and her ideas to meet someone else&#39;s.  I&#39;ve encouraged<br/>\nher fantasy world and have helped it come to life as much as I can. <br/>\nSure, she&#39;s a little different than most kids her age, 14 going on 15,<br/>\nbut she is who she is and nothing will change that.  So, I can harm her<br/>\nand minimize who she is, or I can support her and encourage who she is. <br/>\nTo me, it&#39;s really that simple.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll kids can thrive in an environment that supports them in the<br/>\nindividual ways in which they need it.  Schools don&#39;t do that nearly as<br/>\nwell as a caring parent that has the time to support their kids. <br/>\nUnschooling is really trusting that your kids are whole and wonderful<br/>\njust the way they are, trusting that they will do what they need to do<br/>\nto get what they want in life.  As a parent, who unschools, what we do,<br/>\nis guide them and help them in whatever way that we can, to ensure that<br/>\nthey do (get what they want and need).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t sound all that different than parents who have their kids in<br/>\nschool, on the surface.  What is profoundly different is the<br/>\nexpectations that an unschooling parent has, which are very different<br/>\nthan school expectations.  The focus on the relationship between parent<br/>\nand child and that trust and respect for the child as a person, really<br/>\nis what sets unschooling apart.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking for ways to change a child who is, in school eyes, needing a<br/>\npsychologist, is just one of many ways in which schools do damage to<br/>\nkids.  The premise is that there is something wrong with the child, or<br/>\nin your son&#39;s case, something &quot;right&quot; with your child.  Neither of these<br/>\nare a very good measure of a person, the unique individual sitting there<br/>\nbefore you.  No matter how much schools try to cater to an individual,<br/>\nthey aren&#39;t designed to do that, they are designed to turn out a<br/>\nproduct.  If the child fits the school model for turning out a good<br/>\nproduct, like your son does, schools can claim to succeed.  But for<br/>\nevery child like your son, there is a child like your daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you take those same 2 kids and take them out of that system, and help<br/>\neach of them be the people they are, they can both succeed.  There are<br/>\nno &quot;A&quot; students or &quot;B&quot; students or &quot;F&quot; students, there are only kids<br/>\nwith different minds and abilities, some of them just fit into the<br/>\nschool model better.
