One came through anyway  <br/>\n(either I accidentally sent it or another moderator did; it&#39;s okay).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list isn&#39;t for exchanging recipes, or valentines, or for finding  <br/>\nfree sources for antibiotics.   If there&#39;s anyone here who&#39;s only on  <br/>\nthis list and no others, and if you feel you&#39;re missing out on the  <br/>\nbenefits of yahoo lists, please state your needs here in this topic  <br/>\nand people can let you know where to find such things.  If you want  <br/>\nto be on a homeschooling penpal exchange, or to sign petitions, or to  <br/>\nknow about the problems some homeschoolers have had with local  <br/>\ngovernment, please find another list for that!  I don&#39;t mind people  <br/>\nhelping you find one now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list, which is my list, is intended for discussion of natural  <br/>\nlearning and unschooling.  I&#39;d like for the discussion to unfold in  <br/>\nways that people all over the world can find useful.  If someone  <br/>\nbrings a link to an especially interesting art site or an interactive  <br/>\nworld map about something cool, that&#39;s fine. That&#39;s as accessible to  <br/>\npeople in Australia as to those in the U.K.    Announcements about  <br/>\nsomething happening in Vermont wouldn&#39;t be as useful (no that there&#39;s  <br/>\nanything happening in Vermont, it was just an example).<br/>\n<br/>\nI encourage everyone here to get out and about on the internet. I&#39;m  <br/>\nassuming people already do that.  If you go to blogs, you&#39;ll find  <br/>\nlinks to other blogs and to people&#39;s favorite websites, and you&#39;ll be  <br/>\non the superhighway to everything.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thinkingsticks.blogspot.com\">http://thinkingsticks.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWanting this list to provide everything to everyone is kinda like  <br/>\nwanting to get a facial at a pizza place, or to buy flowers where  <br/>\nthey&#39;re repairing your computer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/alwayslearning\">http://sandradodd.com/alwayslearning</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to be really busy this week, and I was afraid I&#39;d come back  <br/>\nto a discussion about how I hate Valentine&#39;s Day or something,  <br/>\nbecause I don&#39;t think this list is the place for penpal stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41284,"nextTopicId":41240}}
