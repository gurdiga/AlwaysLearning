I hate to be woken up.  It puts me in a bad mood.<br/>\nthey go downstairs and make messess.  they make lots of noise.  they fight over the couch and whether to watch t.v. or play video games, or over lego pieces or who gets on the computer first. I spent alot of time trying to figure out why they do this and telling myself that they should be able to handle a few minutes in the morning so I could wake up peacefully (they dont fight much during the rest of the day).  And then it dawned on me that this isnt THEIR problem, it is mine.  Fact is they need me in the morning and I need to get to sleep earlier and find a way to either wake up ealier than them or quit getting angry that they are waking me up.  <br/>\nFor whatever reason, the origional posters son cant handle the feeling of being left alone.  Quite honestly, being left alone, one night in ICU might have done it.  That kind of experience can be very very traumatic to a child (surgeries) at a young age and he may not even be able to pinpoint the fear he is feeling when he is alone in a room. That fear exhibits itself in destructiveness. He is trying to communicate to you how he feels, when you leave him alone in a room.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIn referance to this list being full of bullies.

What will matter is if a<br/>\npositive change happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we do the same things, we get the same results. You can&#39;t explain to<br/>\ncause a change.

What is this aloneness<br/>\nthey see that you don&#39;t, and how can you learn to see it and prevent it? It<br/>\nis important to stop focusing on what you have been doing, since obviously<br/>\nits causing you problems and rather than say &quot;I DID do that, but....&quot; just<br/>\nsee what else you could do that fits the suggestions more exactly. If<br/>\nnothing occurs to you that seems different, try asking for a script. Ask<br/>\npeople what they suggest you do and do that exactly. It may mean not making<br/>\nvases. It may mean allowing him all the access to the clay that he wants. It<br/>\nmay mean going to great efforts to keep things you want safe out of his<br/>\nsight. It may mean stopping focusing on the words and getting down to doing.<br/>\nThere are many suggestions. Don&#39;t run them hypothetically in your mind and<br/>\nsee problems with them - you are shooting yourself in the foot. Try them out<br/>\nphysically before trashing them. Otherwise, its not going to matter how much<br/>\ngood advice is poured and how much you seek it. that gap between the cup and<br/>\nthe lip will keep frustrating you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI apologize if this is offensive, my intention is to point out a gap I see<br/>\nthat I think is making the help you get not actually help you.<br/>\n<br/>\nVidyut<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279647515,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"&quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;d.lewis@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: I&#39;m back needing help","postDate":"1271359584","msgId":52810,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVBNDMwMzdGOENBRjQ2ODRCRDk1RDc2QTZDNDVDRTM3QGRlYm9yYWg0M2YxM2ZkPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhxN2JvdCsxb2NyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NEJDNzVDQUUuODA4MDYwM0BlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":52809,"nextInTopic":52811,"prevInTime":52809,"nextInTime":52811,"topicId":52755,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***This is one very angry little boy.*** I think so too.

I think I remember this poster asking about constant interruption from her son.  That she would be wanting to read her mail and he&#39;d be there every few minutes interrupting her.   <br/>\nHe is alone too much.  A child coming to his mom should not be thought of as an interruption.  Kids need attention and some kids need more than others.   It&#39;s possible he&#39;s figured out that his mom will always have something better to do than be with him.    When I read this post I wondered why is the mom making vases and gluing shells when she has a kid so very obviously needing her attention, needing to be occupied?   <br/>\n<br/>\nBe with him from the time he wakes up until he goes to bed.  If that means eating microwave meals or crackers and cheese or going to KFC for dinner, do that.  Don&#39;t get him started on a project and then leave him, stay with him, play with him, be right there.   Don&#39;t go make vases or read mail.   Get out and do things he likes.   Go play Frisbee, go find a climbing wall, go swimming, go bike riding, go bowling, set up a badminton net  - whatever he&#39;d like to do.

I would ask my son what he was doing before I left the room.  If he said &quot;nothing&quot;, I would have suggested/offer things for him to do.  An 8 year old is kind of young, in my opinion, to just be left in another room while I go off to do what I want.  He really may have picked the vase apart because he didn&#39;t know what else to do.  Maybe he was bored.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;When i push it and say:I am really hurt you did that! He screams: I hate you and starts yelling more like he wants to shut me up...control me with his anger so he doesn&#39;t feel bad about what he did.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe he really does feel bad about it before you even tell him so, and he&#39;s getting angry because he feels worse when you state what&#39;s obvious to him.  Kids can often tell how we feel about something just by looking at our face, especially if we&#39;re upset.  The idea that he wants to shut you up and control you may be a reaction to you trying to control him with your statements of how his actions make you feel.  Honestly, aren&#39;t you telling him how you feel so that you can change his behavior?  Maybe he isn&#39;t trying to control as much as he is trying to communicate to you that he needs help in finding things to do that are acceptable to you. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What might be leading up to this stuff and what can can i do better?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with some of the other responses that your son might need lots to do to keep his hands busy.  Maybe he just needs SOMETHING to do.  What were you expecting him to do while you went in the other room to eat?  Maybe you could tell him before you leave him alone, and maybe give him interesting things to do.  Maybe you two can do more together.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a friend who had a daughter who was frequently &quot;getting into things she shouldn&#39;t&quot;.  This little girl was always looking for things to do, and if her mother wasn&#39;t there to suggest things and guide her, the girl would often find things that ended up causing damage (things like nail polish on the sofa, swinging a gerbil around in a basket until it droppped).  I witnessed and tried to intervene in many of the things the girl was about to do, and she never seemed to have ill intent.  She was just very active and interested in trying things out.  It always seemed to be that the mother was expecting her daughter to behave differently while she was off doing something else, even though she knew how her daughter was.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you feel your child cannot be trusted to be play alone, don&#39;t leave him alone.  Play with him and give him immediate feedback about his choices.  Provide him with more acceptable alternatives to what he wants to do, or like others said, things to purposefully deconstruct if that is really what he wants.  Just don&#39;t leave him alone with nothing to do and expect him to do nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeanne </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":402609764,"authorName":"Ana Maria Bruce","from":"Ana Maria Bruce &lt;bittersweetanamaria@...&gt;","profile":"bittersweetanamaria","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"breaking things...","postDate":"1271312473","msgId":52791,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU5NDY5NC44MDQ3NC5xbUB3ZWIxMTE4MTMubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDcxOTU5MS4xNzY2LnFtQHdlYjExMDQxNi5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGhxNHVoOStxam51QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NzE5NTkxLjE3NjYucW1Ad2ViMTEwNDE2Lm1haWwuZ3ExLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":52790,"nextInTopic":52795,"prevInTime":52790,"nextInTime":52792,"topicId":52755,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"///Bring in overwhelmingly large amounts of things to take apart and destroy, in large and small ways, with screw drivers and hammers.

I think he was expecting it to bounce like his similarly sized and shaped green rubber elephant would have done.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother time when he was about seven or eight, he picked up an owl statue that was in our garden that his sister had bought the year before he was born. I asked him to put it down and he said &quot;Okay&quot; and threw it to the ground breaking its head off. He didn&#39;t know it was meaningful to me; I think to him it was merely an innocent victim in a game.

Some kids just don&#39;t have it.  Some kids don&#39;t intentionally break stuff, and if might help to view it that way.  There are kids who very absent-mindedly do things with their hands without even realizing they are doing them.  Sometimes brains work faster than hands and sometimes bodies and hands work faster than brains.  At some point, for those impulsive people, their brains and bodies start working together.  That&#39;s my theory anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really do believe that for some kids they really can&#39;t help breaking things, it just happens by no fault of their own.  Remember the saying &quot;like a bull in a china shop&quot;?  That&#39;s how some kids are in life.  If it were my child, I wouldn&#39;t assume ill intent.  Keep the things you truly treasure out of sight.  Bring in overwhelmingly large amounts of things to take apart and destroy, in large and small ways, with screw drivers and hammers.  Find old cd&#39;s to break or plastic to melt.  Keep his hands so busy that his mind can catch up.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe yelled because what you said was hurtful to him, especially if he really didn&#39;t mean to break your stuff, which he already was, in hind sight, feeling badly about.  You reaffirmed his own thoughts that he&#39;d done something terrible and intentional, even when he really didn&#39;t.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":373387508,"authorName":"troubadour4me","from":"&quot;troubadour4me&quot; &lt;ronniegreek@...&gt;","profile":"troubadour4me","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: I&#39;m back needing help","postDate":"1271281744","msgId":52768,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhxNWQ4ZytwZTUwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhxNTJuMyt1ZW1wQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":52760,"nextInTopic":52770,"prevInTime":52767,"nextInTime":52769,"topicId":52755,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"yup..that s me.
