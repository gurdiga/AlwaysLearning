Possibly that was the original source on Facebook for the  daily <br/>\ngiving-of-thanks status &quot;challenge&quot;. I got it from someone else, but I&#39;m  really <br/>\npleased and thankful that it spread around-it is a great thing for  <br/>\nunschooling, from what I can tell. The one I picked up was &quot;one status update of  <br/>\nsomething you&#39;re thankful for each day through Thanksgiving&quot;, but mine has  <br/>\nevolved.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt has prompted me to start thinking of things I am thankful  for <br/>\nthroughout the day, unprompted. It has been so *nice*, thinking of nice  things, <br/>\nwonderful stuff, happy things that it has made all our lives a bit  brighter and <br/>\nhappier. Mind you, I&#39;m definitely an optimist and generally happy,  but I <br/>\ncan still occasionally get &quot;stuck&quot; in &quot;this sucks&quot; kind of attitudes, but  <br/>\nthis thankfulness exercise seems to have done the trick for being able to move <br/>\n away from that kind of thinking, quickly. Maybe I&#39;ve formed new synapses <br/>\nor  exercized and strengthened parts of the brain that needed it, but it has  <br/>\ndefinitely changed the way I think. I&#39;m enjoying posting something thankful <br/>\n every day *so* much that I&#39;m going to continue indefinitely. Whenever it <br/>\nstops  being new or it becomes challenging to think of something new I&#39;m <br/>\nthankful for,  it will dwindle out of existence for me. Right now, I&#39;m having a <br/>\nhard time  sticking to ONE a day. :~)<br/>\n <br/>\nI hope everyone has a wonderful time with their loved ones  today-we all <br/>\nhave so very much to be thankful for.<br/>\n <br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nDe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Happy Thanksgiving","postDate":"1259198071","msgId":48788,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI0REM4QkQyLUI4QzgtNDgzQS1BMEQwLTY1NUE3N0UyRDMyRUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhla2I5dCs1N2FlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhla2I5dCs1N2FlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48787,"nextInTopic":48790,"prevInTime":48787,"nextInTime":48789,"topicId":48787,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- I am very thankful this year for all my friends and family and for finally completing my chemo and being cancer free!=- Good, Pebs!!
