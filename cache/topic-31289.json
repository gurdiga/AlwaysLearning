Can you really look around your<br/>\npersonal world - not the TV world or the News Reports - and say that<br/>\nMOST of the people you know are cruel and back-stabbing?  Does this<br/>\ninclude you and your husband?  Does it include the people you work with,<br/>\nyour family and neighbors?  To live with this fearful, angry, harsh,<br/>\njudgmental view of people must create a very unhappy life. Is this<br/>\nreally what you want to pass on to your child to carry with him the rest<br/>\nof his life?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  My experiance has brought me to know this is true also.

I know<br/>\nthat it can be hard to not see the world as a negative place when you&#39;ve<br/>\nhad such negative experiences.  I don&#39;t know you and can&#39;t begin to<br/>\nunderstand the circumstances that brought you to that place, however I<br/>\ndo think that there was a lot more going on than just being naïve and<br/>\ntrusting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs some have already mentioned, our thoughts and beliefs are a huge<br/>\nfactor in how we experience the world.  And Im not just talking about<br/>\nthe spiritual belief in Law of Attraction or &quot;The Secret.&quot;   You don&#39;t<br/>\nhave to believe in that in order to benefit from an attitude that the<br/>\nworld is generally a safe and good place. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a growing field called Positive Psychology that has done some<br/>\nserious research on the benefits of having a positive outlook on life.<br/>\nPeople who see the world in generally positive ways tend to be<br/>\nhealthier, live longer and report the most satisfaction in life.  This<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean that bad things don&#39;t happen to them, but they have a<br/>\nresiliency that helps them through negative events.  People who don&#39;t<br/>\nhold on to past grudges and find things to be grateful for and who are<br/>\noptimistic about their future live happier, healthier lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are ways to teach your son how to be cautious and smart about his<br/>\ninteractions in the world without setting him up with huge emotional<br/>\narmor and fear.  From an Unschooling perspective, the greatest thing you<br/>\ncan do for your child is to help him cultivate his inner resources to<br/>\nmake wise choices about his safety and the people he befriends or comes<br/>\nin contact with.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe all have a type of radar within us that draws us to those who match<br/>\nour ideas about the world.  This is mostly done unconsciously.  For<br/>\nexample, in my younger years, all the men I met and dated seemed to be<br/>\nalcoholic philanderers.  All the men my friends dated matched that same<br/>\ndescription.  Most all of my friends had really dysfunctional<br/>\nrelationships.  When I discovered the power of my beliefs and thoughts I<br/>\nbegan to change that reality.  I started looking around for other<br/>\nexamples of nice men.  I made a conscious choice to find couples who<br/>\nwere in loving, committed healthy relationships. I started working on my<br/>\nown self-esteem and changing what I believed was possible in a<br/>\nrelationship. It took dedication and some time, but soon I started<br/>\nmeeting men who were not alcoholics and started befriending women who<br/>\nwere in good relationships.  I met and married my husband, who is<br/>\ngenuinely an honest and good person.  Now I can say that MOST of the men<br/>\nI meet are just really nice hard-working loving guys.  This doesn&#39;t mean<br/>\nthat I don&#39;t come into contact with men who are not nice, but they are<br/>\njust simply not on my radar anymore.  If I do meet them, I don&#39;t choose<br/>\nto engage or I&#39;m just not interested in doing business with them, etc.<br/>\nEmpowering your child to know that he has ability to attract nice, safe,<br/>\ncaring people into his life can be the greatest gift you give him. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband said if i think the world is a beautiful<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; place(meaning peoplewise) I am dreaming.<br/>\n&gt; I am thinking how to go about letting Lukas know this or if we should?<br/>\n&gt; What&#39;s you all&#39;s take on it?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Heather, I do hope you seriously reconsider giving your son such a dark<br/>\nview of the world.  You and your husband are his greatest influence<br/>\nthough, so your son has probably already picked up on your negative<br/>\nattitudes and fears.  Unless you are committed to changing your own<br/>\nworld view, your son will most likely play out your fears in his own<br/>\nlife.  I hope that you look into resources that might help your whole<br/>\nfamily have a more optimistic view (and experience) of people in your<br/>\nlives.<br/>\n<br/>\nWishing you the best,<br/>\nSunday</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":266096457,"authorName":"momma","from":"&quot;momma&quot; &lt;southernbelle@...&gt;","profile":"centurykissed","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: A positive outlook or realistic outlook?","postDate":"1194361129","msgId":31301,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZncHZmOSs3MG42QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDBEODk3N0UzLUE4RTQtNDJFMy1CQ0M2LTJBNEVFN0FDODlEMEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":31300,"nextInTopic":31303,"prevInTime":31300,"nextInTime":31302,"topicId":31289,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The human mind can be <br/>\nviewed as having two main functions: a thinker and a prover. The <br/>\nthinker can think anything. The prover has no such choice: whatever the <br/>\nthinker thinks, the prover arranges all incoming information to prove <br/>\nthat thought to be true. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf a person believes they are stupid, their prover will sort and filter <br/>\nall incoming data to prove that belief to be true. If they believe they <br/>\nare clever, the prover will sort and filter incoming data to prove that <br/>\nbelief true. If you believe you will always be poor, that life is <br/>\nunfair, and that people are basically rotten, your prover will find <br/>\nevidence of those beliefs. If you believe that you can become <br/>\nfantastically wealthy, that life is a wonderful adventure, and that <br/>\npeople are intrinsically good, your prover will create an iron clad <br/>\ncase to prove those beliefs to be correct. <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, over time, the external reality of your life comes into line <br/>\nwith whatever you&#39;ve been thinking.

He wants Lukas<br/>\nto know that the world is a cold,hard place and no one is going to<br/>\ngive a rats ass about him(except his wife,girlfriend).<br/>\n My experiance has brought me to know this is true also. I was very<br/>\ntrusting and naive growing up and i was molested,ripped off, tricked<br/>\nand so on. My husband said if i think the world is a beautiful<br/>\nplace(meaning peoplewise) I am dreaming.<br/>\nI am thinking how to go about letting Lukas know this or if we should?<br/>\nWhat&#39;s you all&#39;s take on it?<br/>\nthanks,Heather</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31428,"nextTopicId":31453}}
