My milk dried up at some point, Linnaea was producing hormones that stopped my milk from flowing. So it hurt when he nursed, but I made a decision that I didn&#39;t want him to suffer because David and I chose to have another child. Or, at least, to do what I could to minimise the impact of Linnaea. So, while I couldn&#39;t bring my milk back I could let him suckle at my breast. And when my milk did return, he and Linnaea tandem nursed. But, I would get irritated at his nursing on occasion. <br/>\n<br/>\nI spent some time looking up the data, but it was a long time ago, so I can&#39;t give citations on this. There is a change in hormones that occurs as your baby moves through toddler-hood. You are physiologically moving toward having another baby. Having one still on the go breastfeeding makes it more difficult to get pregnant and puts you in a position of not being able to invest as much energy into the new baby. The irritation is you laying ground for the next child. Or, so I remember the argument going. It may help you to be aware of why you are touchy about being touched. It may help you to override those evolved traits if you see how they don&#39;t have to play out in this part of your relationship with your child. Like knowing that there are times of the month when you need to breathe more and speak less. Recognising how much your hormones are responsible for how you react or act in a given situation may give you greater choice and control over those<br/>\n things. Or, at least, it seems to do a bit for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n From: david lewis &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:d.lewis@...\">d.lewis@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Wednesday, 3 October 2012, 4:56<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Re:3 y.o. and breast grabbing<br/>\n <br/>\nI guess I don’t understand if it bothers you because he’s touching <br/>\nyou or if he’s hurting you.<br/>\n  <br/>\nIf he’s hurting you, stop his hand and show him how to be gentle.  Be <br/>\ngentle with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it’s bothering you for some other reason, what’s the reason?  It <br/>\nwas ok for him to touch you when he was breast feeding, right?  Is it the <br/>\ndifferent way he touches you, like a rough game?<br/>\n<br/>\nHe doesn’t know what to do.  He still likes those breasts!  They were a <br/>\npretty important part of life for three years.  He’s trying to figure out <br/>\nhow to live without breast feeding and still have that nice comfort.

Not that extreme, though, and I suppose that is because","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-977894266\">Hi Teresa, <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is still nursing at almost 3 and 1/2 and I experience kinda the same things you do. Not that extreme, though, and I suppose that is because we still nurse. But the interest in breasts, in being extremely close to them, fondling them and loving them is there. Talking about it, too, and how men do not have them, but have nipples, and other women who have no children do not have milk in the breast, etc.. What I noticed is that my son understands very well the concept of another one&#39;s body or pain, so when I feel that I do not want him to do something I just explain. I do not know if all children are &quot;the same&quot; in that, because generalization on the base of age does not do very much good in other areas.. But with my son being around the same age, I will just tell you what works for us. You can take some of what I say and see how it feels for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son loves the breast and he loves nursing - although I do not think I have much milk left.. He nurses especially at night and he wants to do it during the day when he is sleepy or scared. When during the day nursing is not possible or desirable (socially or for me) I just explain to him why that is not possible and mostly he just wants to be &quot;by me&quot;, to compensate. At night, and especially in the morning when we wake up, he wants to play a lot with the breasts. With his hands, making circles, with his face against the bare breasts, you get the picture. And he wants to play with the nipple. Some of these things annoy me physically.. I do not have any problem with all this psychically or emotionally because I can sense his real need in closeness to the breasts. If I look at my son I see no testing of the boundaries, or asking if I still love him when he plays, just a pleasure of playing with something that is familiar and loved, soft and warm and mommy. When children nurse (for such a long time) they are attached to that kind of closeness and the breasts are a symbol for them. If I forbid my son to play (with the breasts) (or any other thing), it develops into a kind of mini obsession, to do it anyway possible. I think he is also transitioning to stopping with nursing and as the nursing subsides, the play with the breast increases. To me, it looks like he is now able to learn healthy boundaries. I am showing him that I have another body (believe it or not, that might be an issue!!) and that doing what he does can provoke pain in my body. I explain that &quot;doing so&quot; does pain (to me) and I know that he knows what &quot;pain&quot; means, other wise I remember him about times he had pain because of a fall or something recent.. To me, explaining about &quot;appropriate&quot; at this age, makes no sense. As punishment also does not, however people call it. By punishment he will maybe learn not to touch you like you do not want, but will remain with the frustration, and who knows, develop a real &quot;breast obsession&quot; later because of what he missed now and because of the punishment. <br/>\nAlso, to me, from this position, restarting nursing does not sound like something he would want.. And from what I read I understood that children even &quot;forget&quot; how to do it, if the nursing stopped some month before.. So eventually if it feels right, you could try that.. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe just explain to him about pain and that mommy must cry if she feels pain. And that his pleasure is free until it reaches somebody else and they get no pleasure from it, or something in that line. There was a great quote, something like &quot;your freedom stops at the border of my freedom&quot;. It was a big eye opener for me because I never could say &quot;no&quot; in regards to my own body use, if it involved the pleasure of somebody else... I need(ed) to learn this for myself, and my son is a great teacher in that way..<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe also have a look at your own use of your body and boundaries, because to me it sounds like he is also mirroring something in you. How do you show where your boundaries are? With other people? Like, if someone else than your son does not respect your body or boundaries, what do you do? Do you feel you need to get angry to be clear with the other person? How do you keep yourself untouched? And if you have a better way with other people, why not with Fox?<br/>\n<br/>\nI learned with my son a lot, and every time we get into a &quot;fight&quot; with each other, I also look at &quot;my stuff&quot;... But if it is just &quot;his stuff&quot;, I can just say: I say &quot;no&quot; to this because.. (So and so for me or for another person).. If it is about society rules, I think at this age he will not understand what society means... <br/>\n<br/>\nIn conclusion you could try:<br/>\nIf he touches you at home in a way that you do not like, you could explain about pain, and that mama cannot allow Fox to give her pain, even if Fox will cry. <br/>\nMama&#39;s body is hers to decide upon. <br/>\nFox can decide how he wants to play, within mama&#39;s boundaries. <br/>\nI love you does not mean I accept pain from you.<br/>\nDo not leave the room, I think that is too much for him, especially because you say he grabs you to keep you there. But maybe you could keep him at an arm distance? And maybe not punish him as in the &quot;we do not go to the park..&quot; but say you may do &quot;this&quot;, but not &quot;that&quot;, and if you do &quot;that&quot; than the playing with the breast stops.. Because they are your breasts:-) <br/>\nAnd maybe using the principle of &quot;what you focus on, expands&quot;, focus on your boundaries and on all other kinds of physical play.. You could also try to explain to him in his sleep, but that is another kind of subject than this list allows, if you find that appealing, write to me personally.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck with it and maybe tell us what worked?<br/>\n<br/>\nIoana (mama of Victor, 3 years, 5 month)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOp 2 okt. 2012 om 02:40 heeft &quot;teresa&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:treesock@...\">treesock@...</a>&gt; het volgende geschreven:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;teresa&quot; &lt;treesock@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I think you hit the nail on the head.

I<br/>\nrealize, though, that she finds comfort in them, even though nursing has<br/>\nstopped. So I don&#39;t stop her right away.

Maybe consider allowing faux nursing (not suckling, just time to<br/>\nhug or cuddle so that he can feel your breasts on his body hugging him or<br/>\nsomething) a few times a day. Maybe promise that (please don&#39;t touch now,<br/>\nbut maybe later you can cuddle on them). Try to imagine how he&#39;s feeling<br/>\nabout them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps!

That might be a kind of compromise, but I would expect it to involve him at least touching your breasts. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] 3 y.o. and breast grabbing","postDate":"1349135418","msgId":69187,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERBNDMzMDU4LUE1NzQtNEJERi04RDdBLTREOUExOUQwNjc3OEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGs0Y3RmcytwYW85QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGs0Y3RmcytwYW85QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69184,"nextInTopic":69189,"prevInTime":69186,"nextInTime":69188,"topicId":69181,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"You might already have tried this, but you could tell him that there are some parts of bodies that can t be touched by other people.

I think that&#39;s exactly what he&#39;s asking...will you still love me when...? and testing the boundaries. But I&#39;m fumbling with what to do with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it is now, I almost always start with a sharp &quot;No.&quot; (Sometimes followed by &quot;I don&#39;t like that.&quot; or &quot;That&#39;s uncomfortable.&quot;) That sometimes works for that moment--he&#39;ll stop touching my breast, but then gently lean his head on my shoulder, slowly, slowly, moving his hand or his head down again... At that point, I have told him I was going to put him down or leave the room if he kept touching me there, because I said no. Then, one of two things happens: he stops, because of my threat, or he doesn&#39;t, and I leave the room to do something else, with him usually grabbing at me as I go to keep me there with him. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt feels awful. I didn&#39;t start with this strategy, so maybe I let it go with the gentle redirection for too long and made things harder for myself. But I&#39;ve been consistent with the &quot;stops&quot;--there&#39;s no point that I want to or even feel as if I *could* let things slide! But it has kept up. So, I find myself in that sharp/rejecting/growing-into-angry/frustrated place with him too often. <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Oct 1, 2012, at 1:13 PM, teresa wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; He&#39;d come up and grab my boob, then look up at me with a challenging expression<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My first thought is he&#39;s asking &quot;Do you still love me even when I do this?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Or it might be a power thing, wanting to test boundaries.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A clear No may be what he needs.

It&#39;s not unschooling, being that my son is 3 years and 9 months old, but it is challenging me at being a peaceful parent. I&#39;m hoping some of you may have some ideas about how to handle this one well and keep things good between my little boy and me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m having a lot of difficult feelings about him grabbing my breasts, fondling my breasts, smacking me in the breast, burying his face in my breasts, and reaching into my clothes to &quot;bounce&quot; my breasts. (I know--it seems so silly typed out like this! But truly, I&#39;m struggling, because in the moment, it&#39;s not always funny.) I have taken to wearing double sports-bras during the day to limit the physically jarring sensation, but that doesn&#39;t work all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nFox weaned himself when he was just three, so about nine months ago now. I could tell almost right away that he wasn&#39;t sure about having stopped. But, I didn&#39;t offer for him to start back up again. I felt good about our breastfeeding relationship, and I felt good about stopping when we did. My milk was gone anyway, but he continues to sleep with me in bed. So, at first, I would just gently redirect him when he showed a lot of interest in my breasts, playing a silly game, getting out a toy we hadn&#39;t played with in a while, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think Fox started picking up on my resistance to the attention he paid to my chest, because his demeanor began changing when he did it. He&#39;d come up and grab my boob, then look up at me with a challenging expression. I&#39;d say, &quot;I don&#39;t like that. Touch me here (moving his hand to my arm, side, stomach).&quot; And then try to move on to something light and fun, or offer to sit and cuddle him. But, the cuddles led to more grabs and squeezes, and taking his hands playfully to otherwise occupy them by giving them kisses playing a hand-clapping game do not fool him one bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s a pretty independent little guy and likes to do his own thing a lot, but when he&#39;s ready for time together again, then it&#39;s all cuddles and climbing on me and sitting right next to me, as we watch TV together, read books, play with toys, go to the park, etc. That&#39;s lovely for us both. I give him lots of love when I walk by and he&#39;s playing by himself or with his brother. It seems like a good rhythm to our day of being together, him doing something else, being together, us all doing something together (6 y.o. brother, him, and me). <br/>\n<br/>\nBut almost inevitably, periods of physical contact go to the boob-grabbing place. I&#39;m getting nowhere with distraction or words. And I usually just get up and walk away to do something else--get us both drinks, let the dogs in, get a book. I don&#39;t like breaking up what&#39;s a precious, sweet time for us, but I&#39;m so uncomfortable! I am starting to cringe inwardly when he comes running into my lap, and I want desperately not to be in that mindset.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\nmama to Woody (almost 7) and Fox (3 years, 9 months)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://honeyhousehomeschool.blogspot.com/\">http://honeyhousehomeschool.blogspot.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69100,"nextTopicId":69218}}
