There&#39;s quite a bit to read at their  <br/>\nwebsite.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNew Web Magazine for Self-Directed Learners of All Ages<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are excited to announce the launch of a new bimonthly web magazine  <br/>\nfor self-directed learners of all ages—grown unschoolers, teenage  <br/>\nunschoolers, parents unschooling themselves while they homeschool  <br/>\ntheir kids, and adults who follow their inner compass and never stop  <br/>\nlearning.<br/>\n<br/>\nSponge Magazine is a community and lifestyle magazine for people who  <br/>\nare curious about the world around them and learning all the time. It  <br/>\nis the hub of an interconnected web of self-directed learners eager  <br/>\nto share experiences, resources, advice, inspiration, encouragement,  <br/>\nand new ideas to learning problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat resources currently exist for homeschoolers/unschoolers and  <br/>\ntheir parents, but there is nothing for homeschoolers/unschoolers  <br/>\nbeyond high school age. Sponge Magazine fills the void for  <br/>\nunschooling adults, anyone who understands that self-directed  <br/>\nlearning is more than an educational practice–it&#39;s a lifestyle based  <br/>\non curiosity, self-empowerment and inner truth.<br/>\n<br/>\nSponge Magazine will include features and columns covering a wide  <br/>\nrange of topics, including:<br/>\nMaking the transition from childhood to adulthood as a self-directed  <br/>\nlearner<br/>\nDealing with the struggle between self-direction and mainstream  <br/>\nvalues/lifestyle<br/>\nLife as a self-directed learner<br/>\nTravel opportunities well-suited for self-directed learners<br/>\nMainstream news interpreted from the self-directed learner perspective<br/>\nProfiles of famous self-directed learners<br/>\nReaders sharing a new idea, lifestyle, experience, discovery or area  <br/>\nof interest that gets them totally psyched<br/>\nAnd much more<br/>\nHere are some sample article titles:<br/>\n“Full-Time Work: Is It Necessary?”<br/>\n“Discovering a Kinesthetic Learning Style”<br/>\n“Starting a Dotcom”<br/>\n“I&#39;m a Cook at Moosewoods”<br/>\n“Berkana Learning Journey to Mexico”<br/>\n<br/>\nSponge Magazine was co-founded by Peter Kowalke. A lifelong  <br/>\nunschooler, Peter is a columnist for Life Learning Magazine and Home  <br/>\nEducator&#39;s Family Times, and a former columnist for Home Education  <br/>\nMagazine. Peter was communications director at the Clonlara School.  <br/>\nHe is the producer of Grown Without Schooling, a documentary about  <br/>\ngrown homeschoolers, and he&#39;s a regular speaker at homeschooling  <br/>\nconferences.<br/>\n<br/>\nSponge Magazine officially debuts in October, but we’re soft- <br/>\nlaunching the publication in May with the first of three, smaller  <br/>\n&quot;newsletter&quot; issues. There are many ways to get involved:<br/>\n<br/>\nSign up to receive the newsletter and magazine.<br/>\nBe part of the discussion in our forums. Help make it the way you  <br/>\nwant by contributing ideas and suggestions for what should be in the  <br/>\nmagazine, share advice for how we should run the project, discuss  <br/>\nissues, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nVolunteer. We need writers, editors, web designers, promoters, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are interested in getting involved with Sponge or just want to  <br/>\nreceive the first issue when it is released, visit and sign up at  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://launch.spongemagazine.org/\">http://launch.spongemagazine.org/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWe look forward to hearing from you!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28390,"nextTopicId":28365}}
