I think this is one of the greatest things about <br/>\nunschoolers, and that is that we have a flexibility which allows our children to make <br/>\nchoices--maybe they work, maybe they don&#39;t, but they choose something and get to move <br/>\nforward on their decisions.  How empowering!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis teaches them something very important, I think.  I think it teaches them that it is ok <br/>\nto jump---to try something they aren&#39;t totally sure about, and it is equally ok to then say <br/>\n&quot;hey, this isn&#39;t for me&quot; and be able to move ON toward something better.  And usually it is <br/>\nthe experience that creates a bridge they maybe couldn&#39;t see before.  It sometimes gives <br/>\nthem that knowledge about THEMSELVES that they needed in order to grow.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is hard as a parent to let your kids make big decisions (like attending school!) if you <br/>\ndon&#39;t necessarily see the good of it.  I have learned that good comes from every <br/>\nexperience.  Growth--self-knowledge, mended relationships, boosted self-esteem, <br/>\nawareness.....<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck with Allie and her new found self!<br/>\n<br/>\nkelley<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sandandstardust.blogspot.com\">http://www.sandandstardust.blogspot.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Update on Allie&#39;s school decision","postDate":"1220369368","msgId":37852,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgwOTAyMDgyOW8yZDc0OGJmZnViZTE1YTc4NzBiMWJlYjIwQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGc5amQ0YytxczlvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGc5amQ0YytxczlvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":37844,"nextInTopic":37867,"prevInTime":37851,"nextInTime":37853,"topicId":37844,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"That s great about Allie, and about work hours too.
