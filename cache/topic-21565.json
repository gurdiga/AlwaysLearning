He liked hearing about what we&#39;d watched.  I<br/>\nremember on Monday mornings he&#39;s ask what we&#39;d done over the weekend and<br/>\nthen he&#39;s ask, &quot;Anybody see anything good on TV?&quot;  and we&#39;d talk about<br/>\nwhatever it was.    <br/>\n<br/>\nHe also smoked his pen and when he was frustrated he&#39;d tell us one day<br/>\nhe&#39;d marry a nice, beautiful blond lady and forget all about noisy fifth<br/>\ngraders. &lt;g&gt;   Kind of a nut.
