He usually","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-877619792\">Hi Melanie,<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to share that my 11 yo son has been on X-box live since July<br/>\nevery day that we have been home (all but two or three days). He usually<br/>\ngets up in the morning and goes right to it...before eating or drinking or<br/>\nanything. If I don&#39;t bring him food, it will sometimes be four hours or more<br/>\nbefore he stops to get something to eat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings I am currently doing:<br/>\n-sitting with him while he plays...it&#39;s VERY exciting stuff! He&#39;s connected<br/>\nto kids all over the world and I particularly love the conversations they<br/>\nhave about what time it is where they are, and sometimes what DAY it is<br/>\nwhere they are. I&#39;ve listened to my guy &quot;defend&quot; himself because he has a<br/>\nspeech impediment...so eloquently...moreso than I think he would be able to<br/>\nface-to-face (seems like really good practice actually). There really is<br/>\njust so much to love about Xbox live.<br/>\n<br/>\n-noticing what he needs (food, drink, fan on, etc.) while he&#39;s<br/>\nplaying...this has kept our connection while he&#39;s playing.<br/>\n<br/>\n-planning outings that I know he likes (go-carts, movies [especially<br/>\nopenings], ice-cream).<br/>\n<br/>\n-still asking for help when I would like it (he is still responding to this,<br/>\nin particular he likes taking care of animal feedings...however it&#39;s usually<br/>\nnot an immediate response)<br/>\n<br/>\n-writing notes to him rather than interrupt the live action...he asked for<br/>\nthis from all of us (there are 6 of us in the family). He has a hard time<br/>\nlistening to any of us when he is on listening to the players...so we write<br/>\nhim notes and he reads them as soon as his attention can break away.<br/>\n<br/>\nShowing this respect I think is really important.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, I trust that he is doing what he needs to do with this. He has<br/>\nstopped the weekly karate that he has been taking for over a year and a<br/>\nhalf, I think mostly to play Xbox live. There have definitely been times of<br/>\nwonder for both dh and me, but we&#39;re pretty sure we need to be the ones<br/>\nstaying connected to him in respectful ways, rather than *forcing* him to<br/>\ncome to us to stay connected.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also give him feedback about things as we see them. For instance, he<br/>\nbecame very pale after while of playing (like the first month) and began to<br/>\n*look* unhealthy, complete with dark circles around his eyes. We told him we<br/>\nthought his body was showing effects of lowered physical activity and lack<br/>\nof sunshine...maybe even lack what food he may need. It was a great<br/>\nconversation. Cam talked about how he (his body) felt after this somewhat<br/>\nchange in lifestyle. He does take on more thought about his body...I noticed<br/>\nthat he will go outside for a while and run around, chase the dogs during<br/>\nthe day. I think this may be more specifically to stay healthy while playing<br/>\nXbox than because he feels like running with the dogs, but that seems like<br/>\ngood enough reason for me!<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have an &quot;end of the tunnel&quot; view for you as we are smack dab in the<br/>\nmiddle ourselves. I don&#39;t know where it will lead, but we are staying<br/>\nconnected for the ride.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing...Cam has LONG hair...down to his butt. The head piece for<br/>\nXbox live has become SO tangled in his hair SO many times that his head is<br/>\none huge dreadlock. Uncombable. Untangleable. Not just a tangled mess...One<br/>\nBig gnarled matted thick dreadlock. He is not happy about it, but hasn&#39;t<br/>\nmade any decisions about what to do about it yet, if anything. We&#39;ve tried<br/>\neverything we know to comb it, with no success. But that is a separate<br/>\nthread :0)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nJacki<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>]On Behalf Of Melanie Hendershot<br/>\nSent: Saturday, November 05, 2005 11:58 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] HELP!
