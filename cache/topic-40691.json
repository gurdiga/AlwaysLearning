Homeschooled children who grow up in a stimulating and enriched  <br/>\nenvironment surrounded by family and friends who are generally  <br/>\ninterested and interesting, will learn all kinds of things and  <br/>\nrepeatedly surprise you with what they know. If they are supported in  <br/>\nfollowing their own passions, they will build strengths upon  <br/>\nstrengths and excel in their own ways whether that is academic,  <br/>\nartistic, athletic, interpersonal, or whichever direction that  <br/>\nparticular child develops. One thing leads to another. A passion for  <br/>\nplaying in the dirt at six can become a passion for protecting the  <br/>\nnatural environment at 16 and a career as a forest ranger as an  <br/>\nadult. You just never ever know where those childhood interests will  <br/>\neventually lead. Be careful not to squash them; instead, nurture them.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40690,"nextTopicId":40692}}
