There were 11% fatalities from the disease,<br/>\nwhich is less than I thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just FYI; my kids are immunized for tetanus; that&#39;s one I don&#39;t mess<br/>\nwith. I keep myself immunized as well, because of my profession. My<br/>\ngrandmother has told me of watching her three year old sister die from<br/>\ntetanus after she stepped on a nail. I know that was 90 years ago, and the<br/>\nrate has dropped, but it&#39;s still out there. It&#39;s up to you to minimize the<br/>\nrisk to your son and make the best decision for him. Just don&#39;t let the<br/>\nmedical establishment run over you!<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7479,"nextTopicId":7480}}
