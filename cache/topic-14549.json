He is already there - left a few <br/>\nweeks ago.  We were all supposed to go at the same time, but they <br/>\nweren&#39;t letting family members go over there for a while with the war <br/>\nand all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, we&#39;ll be living on a military base.  It&#39;s in the southern part of <br/>\nTurkey, close to the Mediterranean (the hottest part).  I hope that <br/>\nit will be safe enough for us to do some traveling.  The area right <br/>\naround the base is very dependant on Americans spending money there, <br/>\nso they&#39;ll probably be pretty nice, at least on the surface.  I am <br/>\nlooking forward getting there, but I&#39;m just not excited about the <br/>\nwhole moving thing without my husband&#39;s help!  I have 2 daughters - 8 <br/>\n& 3 years old.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Christy<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 5/21/03 7:55:57 AM, unschooling1@y... writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; However, we will be <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; moving to Turkey in about 6 weeks!   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; More opportunity for learning there than at all the conferences in <br/>\nthe world, <br/>\n&gt; I figure!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t feel bad.
