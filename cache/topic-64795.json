Woody Guthrie wrote the very popular ballad about America that starts with these lyrics: <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis land is your land, this land is my land, <br/>\nFrom California, to the New York island, <br/>\nFrom the Redwood forest, to the New York waters. <br/>\nThis land was made for you and me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we have gone from &quot;just watching the Simpsons&quot;  to art history,  museums, geography,  song writing, Facebook, marketing. And in Oklahoma news that was featured in The New York Times, a foundation is purchasing the Woody Guthrie archives from his children and plans to build an exhibition and study center here.  Finally!  It took a long time because some here found his political leanings to be a little leftist, err, communist. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/28/arts/music/woody-guthrie-gets-a-belated-honor-in-oklahoma.html?pagewanted=all%c2%a0\">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/28/arts/music/woody-guthrie-gets-a-belated-honor-in-oklahoma.html?pagewanted=all%c2%a0</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that just added local and national political history. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a couple of pretty picture books here (and probably at your local library) called &quot;This Land is Your Land&quot; :<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_12?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=this+land+is+your+land&sprefix=this+land+is%c2%a0\">http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_12?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=this+land+is+your+land&sprefix=this+land+is%c2%a0</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn that Amazon link we also see sheet music, a Native American book called &quot;This Land is My Land&quot;,  a book called &quot;This Land is Your Land: The Geographic Evolution of the United States&quot;,  and another book about property rights. That added a few more connections.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and we (husband and I) had young woman (early 20&#39;s) in our home last night that we had just met, and we watched the Simpson&#39;s like we usually do. She said she didn&#39;t watch it and wasn&#39;t allowed to watch it growing up because she had four younger siblings. We had a discussion about how we loved all the cultural references in the show and how it might not be for children. But I said that if the child wanted to watch it and the parent was present and watching and commenting and helping the child understand behaviors, words, and actions, then I didn&#39;t see a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nPriscilla Sanstead<br/>\nTulsa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n From: Sadie Bugni &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lotsagr8kidz@...\">lotsagr8kidz@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Monday, January 9, 2012 8:33 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Is it normal to doubt yourself?<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nMy kids also love Simpsons.

Then write down everything  you can think of connected to The<br/>\nSimpsons. I&#39;m a visual person, so when I do it, it kind of looks like a<br/>\nspiderweb.

If they enjoy<br/>\nHomer&#39;s malaprops, find some fun word play games or joke books or a<br/>\ncollection of Yogi Berra quotes. If they&#39;ve never seen a nuclear power<br/>\nplant and there&#39;s one by your house, drive by and/or look at its website.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t get too invested in what you put in their paths - they may or may not<br/>\nbe interested. If they&#39;re not, don&#39;t force the issue, just go onto<br/>\nsomething else. It&#39;s a creative process - what works and what doesn&#39;t<br/>\ndepends on a multitude of factors.

I struggle with anxiety and most of the time I feel great about our lives and about unschooling but every few months or so I start to freak out a little. I worry that I&#39;m not doing enough with them. I am a pretty low key person. I like to be home, so do my kids so we don&#39;t do a ton of extra activities. We swim at the Y and the kids have lots of friends in the neighbourhood that they play with. During the day the kids spend most of their time watching tv (the simpsons is HUGE right now),  playing video games, playing with the new itouches, cooking with me, eating (they are hungry boys). Sometimes I think most of my day is cooking in the kitchen, checkin my emails, editing pics (i&#39;m a photographer).  I watch the simpsons with them all the time but I don&#39;t really play video games with them because if I play I get super dizzy. I guess I am in a self doubt phase right now. Wondering if I am doing enough with them. If they spend the majority of their day playing video games and I am not right there with them... is that ok? The video games are big right now because they just got new ones for Christmas so I know that will where off soon and they will be on to something else. I Just wonder sometimes if I&#39;m doing or being enough. They are so great and finding stuff to do on their own that sometimes I feel like I&#39;m not doing my job right. <br/>\n<br/>\nSebrina<br/>\n(mom to 4 ages 11, 10, 8 and 5)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64846,"nextTopicId":64892}}
