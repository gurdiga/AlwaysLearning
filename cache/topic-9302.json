They are  fairly religious family and they<br/>\nhomeschooled mainly to keep their kids away from other kids they thought<br/>\nwould be a bad influence.  In the beginning they tried to find places for<br/>\ntheir kids to get together with others but as time went on, their family<br/>\ngrew (7 kids) and they ended up living in a rural location.  It just got<br/>\nharder an harder for the mom to get all the kids to all the places they<br/>\nwanted to go and manage with the little babies too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe oldest girl is just now old enough to drive, but I don&#39;t know if they<br/>\nhave just the one vehicle that the dad uses for work or two or what.<br/>\n(should have asked) <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve know the mom since we were nine.(30 years!)
