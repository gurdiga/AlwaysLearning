I may add he is also<br/>\nvery verbal, surprisingly early, and loves to converse, is very social with<br/>\nstrangers and friends and seems to enjoy his life very much.  He is<br/>\nsensitive to the feelings of others, and easily concerned if he hears<br/>\nanother child crying, wanting to help or get him help.

So it was neutral turf, and my husband, son and I had no where<br/>\n  to go to avoid the tv, and we have made a concious choice to avoid it, as<br/>\n  firmly as a nonsmoker avoids smoke filled houses if you understand what I<br/>\n  mean.  So it felt like a violation. She had a tv she could watch in her own<br/>\n  room upstairs but chose to turn on the one in the livingroom, and so we<br/>\n  needed to hide out in the tiny little bedroom with my son and try and spend<br/>\n  the evening reading every book we could find and keep him and ourselves<br/>\n  entertained, yet not having the &quot;visit&quot; we had spent so much money and time<br/>\n  to go there and do.  This was sort of an evening ritual for her.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We do not live near her, but if we did I would, as I said expect her to<br/>\n  respect our values and choices and not expose my son to tv.  Although tv<br/>\n  viewers cannot understand this point of view (just like a smoker may not see<br/>\n  the big deal with smoke filled rooms)  I feel ANY exposure, especially in<br/>\n  the primary years, when he is still establishing his tastes, personality,<br/>\n  and values, any exposure is toxic.  I realize this is not a common belief,<br/>\n  but that is not the point, the point is he is my responsibility, and  I have<br/>\n  worked hard to protect his innocence as a child, that includes avoiding<br/>\n  media like tv and videos.  If she was a smoker she would be expected not to<br/>\n  smoke in his presence.  Same thing.  Or she could choose to visit him at our<br/>\n  house and follow our values, if she felt she should be able to do whatever<br/>\n  she wants in her house, regardless of his or our presence.<br/>\n<br/>\n  To your point about exposure some day, yes, very true.  In fact I have a<br/>\n  plan for exposing him someday, when I feel instinctively the time is right,<br/>\n  and he has some stronger sense of self, and will be less able to be<br/>\n  disturbed or affected by the images as he will understand how unreal they<br/>\n  often are.  Also, we can explain the psychology behind manipulative<br/>\n  programing, advertising etc.  Now I do believe at a certain time it will be<br/>\n  useful to include videos with information he finds useful, especially during<br/>\n  homeschooling, and fullu expect to enjoy with him quality movies someday.<br/>\n  But as I said (an amazingly even the American Academy of Pediatrics agrees<br/>\n  in their statement that no child under age of 2 should view any tv or video)<br/>\n  that the smaller years are not the time for this type of viewing.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks for your thoughtful questions!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Terrie<br/>\n  Mom of Oliver3.5 years<br/>\n  Mom of Benjamin (angel in my heart, would have been 5)<br/>\n  growing new life due in July<br/>\n<br/>\n  It IS a personal choice, but just because your MIL does not have the same<br/>\n  convictions is she really the one at fault?

It was a personal choice<br/>\n  before having children, it is not how I like to spend my time, and I<br/>\n  believe<br/>\n  it is a as you say a tool of the the advertisers, and popular culture which<br/>\n  I am not a believer or participant in (ie wearing the &quot;brand name clothes&quot;<br/>\n  perfumes, perfect body, and I do not like the way many programs show people<br/>\n  treating each other, which is often shallow, cruel, or self serving, which<br/>\n  is modeling behavior I disagree with, and since I believe modeling is how<br/>\n  people and children learn to treat themselves and others it is not<br/>\n  something<br/>\n  I want to observe or have observed by my children. I think it is a personal<br/>\n  choice, and if one disagrees with 90 percent of what is displayed on the<br/>\n  screen (this goes for most children videos too) then it is a reasonable<br/>\n  decision to exclude it from ones life, in the same way that if you disagree<br/>\n  with smoking to not allow smokers in your home while they are smoking or<br/>\n  have just smoked.  For me, it is not just a concern of how much will my<br/>\n  child watch if I open the &quot;flood gates&quot;, and will my child self moderate<br/>\n  the<br/>\n  amount.  It is for me, that I do not like most of what is on the tv, and it<br/>\n  is such a passive activity, and a bit mind numbing.  I never realized  the<br/>\n  effects the tv really had on me until I was tv free for a long time, and<br/>\n  then had exposures (airport, etc) and saw how choppy and short the story<br/>\n  lines and images were, how little time it gave for one to view a scene<br/>\n  before flashing to another, and it actually was uncomfortable to watch<br/>\n  this.<br/>\n  It is not the way the real world is, we don&#39;t see our world around us<br/>\n  flashing and changing scenes and views so jarringly, I think it feels<br/>\n  shocking to the system that has not accommodated to that type of visual<br/>\n  stimuli, and I question the health of it.   I feel that myself and  my<br/>\n  child are better off self stimulating or being with stimulating humans than<br/>\n  a flashing inanimate box.  In the same way, I never used inanimate soothing<br/>\n  devices for my child as an infant (i.e. pacifiers, swings, vibrating baby<br/>\n  seats, fake heartbeats playing on a machine because I believed his nature<br/>\n  was to need human contact and   human soothing.<br/>\n  Now just because I choose to avoid tv, I am not sitting in judgement of<br/>\n  others who choose tv.  I certainly also respect and uphold others choice to<br/>\n  include tv, in the same way that I respect others food choices and<br/>\n  religious<br/>\n  choices.  What I don&#39;t appreciate is when people (like my MIL) think my<br/>\n  choice has no value, and chooses to have the tv on in front of my child<br/>\n  behind my back, because she had decided my choice has not merit.  This is a<br/>\n  violation, just as if she offered my child a food we avoided, or as an<br/>\n  older<br/>\n  child allowed him to have alcohol or exposed him to cigarette smoke.  This<br/>\n  is a lifestyle choice our family has made , we all agree on it, and it<br/>\n  needs<br/>\n  to be respected.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well this is my first post on this board though I&#39;ve been a<br/>\n  lurker....perhaps I won&#39;t be welcome after this (hee hee)<br/>\n  Terrie mother of Oliver 3.5 years<br/>\n  mother of Benjamin ( a dear  memory in my heart, would be 5 . 5 years)<br/>\n  pregnant with new life due in July<br/>\n<br/>\n         Yahoo!
