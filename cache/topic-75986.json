Here&#39;s some things that I&#39;ve<br/>\nfound helpful (my child Leon is 3; I imagine things will change as he<br/>\ngets older):<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- my partner and Leon have breakfast together, and I get a bit of time<br/>\n  to have a cup of tea, shower, read a bit in another room. As we&#39;re<br/>\n  still co-sleeping and Leon often feeds a lot over the last couple of<br/>\n  hours of the night I find this particularly useful.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- both my partner & I work part-time (I work from home). On the days<br/>\n  when I&#39;m working, they usually go out for a bit (sometimes on a long<br/>\n  trip to somewhere exciting, sometimes just out to the<br/>\n  shops/playground). I make a point of taking a tea break and doing a<br/>\n  bit of journalling while the house is empty. (In theory it could work<br/>\n  the other way too -- I could go out to a cafe or whatever while they&#39;re<br/>\n  at home.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- if I&#39;m feeling frazzled when it&#39;s one of my days with Leon, I will<br/>\n  suggest quiet activities -- snuggling up on the sofa with his ipad, or<br/>\n  to watch something, with a snack. I can read for a bit and still be<br/>\n  with him. We often both read/play on tablets over lunch together, too. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- As he&#39;s getting older sometimes I&#39;ll go potter down in the kitchen for<br/>\n  10 minutes if he&#39;s happy and busy. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- I have knitting around, and if he&#39;s happily occupied, I will sit<br/>\n  nearby and knit. I&#39;m still paying attention but I find knitting<br/>\n  calming. Sometimes I read but that can get a bit too engrossing!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- He is usually asleep early evening; I make sure I spend one or two<br/>\n  evenings a week on my own / doing a project I enjoy / reading. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- Mini meditation / mindfulness -- taking as little as thirty seconds to<br/>\n  breathe slowly can be a break. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- Not expecting too much of myself. I&#39;ve found that the more I have on<br/>\n  my to-do list, the harder it is to cope with everything else and the<br/>\n  harder it is to be present with Leon when I&#39;m with him. So I keep<br/>\n  reminding myself that I can choose *not* to do other things :) And<br/>\n  also that it&#39;s OK to do fun recharging things in the evenings and not<br/>\n  &quot;ought to&quot; things.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJuliet</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":374485669,"authorName":"Jason M Dyess","from":"Jason M Dyess &lt;jasonmdyess@...&gt;","profile":"jasonmdyess","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;Self care&quot;","postDate":"1434636403","msgId":76011,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBUG1rdEJfczJoWExxNHNGYm5FT3pmcUN0enZWUVRGeXhFVHdLYzNRYVlKUzNDQ0o9Z0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDlCQzM0NjlELUU4ODAtNDM3Ni1CQjkxLUExQ0Y4OEE4RTZFQkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDA4QzMyNEM1LTc5MzUtNDAwRS04RDU3LTc3NzczOTQyQTNBRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JPENBSl82TUhyeG04RmFYU3lzWDhSMkhCVUFBPUh4UUFTVGFnZWJ3MkZBa3lIdlkxR21QQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JPENBUG1rdEItNHZGWE9QRmR0UHR5QVlPZzlFbm5MTDNNTWV1d1EtVzlSWWE9Nk1wWGkrUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JPDVGN0JBQTIyLUZFM0QtNDhFQi04QUM2LTJGMTkwREU4NzZFMkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JPDlCQzM0NjlELUU4ODAtNDM3Ni1CQjkxLUExQ0Y4OEE4RTZFQkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":76010,"nextInTopic":76013,"prevInTime":76010,"nextInTime":76012,"topicId":75986,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"++ This is what I get for reading e-mail backwards. :-) I responded to a phrase pulled from another post, without its fll paragraph.

I cannot over-emphasize the ways in which this attitude has paid immediate and longer-term dividends for me. When I see my kids priorities as my own, I&#39;m happy: it&#39;s easy to meet everyone&#39;s needs. Over time, I have seen that reciprocity from them. Not a long time, either; my boys are nine and five and they work with me towards solutions all the time, coordinate &quot;up-time&quot; and &quot;down-time&quot; activities (soccer vs.Â  a movie or a board game).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Go to where they are when they are little. It&#39;s the most powerful way to show them how a healthy relationship works. At some point, sooner than either of us realize, no one is going to ask us to go to the zoo anymore.

I have four children. We do some things together; my parents do some things with some of my children; their dad does some things with some children - different combinations.
