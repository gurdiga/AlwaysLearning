For me, I contextualized her comments differently probably due to knowing them and having experienced their family dynamics. I would say her isolation and loneliness was not *within* her family but within her community, which was more limited than we can imagine in our current homeschooling/unschooling climate.<br/>\n<br/>\nAstra is in her 30s so when she unschooled it was a vastly different landscape than it is now. I have always understood that she went to high school because that is where her intellectual peers spent their days.(she also mentions not having role models at the time that hadn&#39;t graduated high school.) She didn&#39;t have the wide-ranging net of friends that our children do thanks to the internet. Her parents did not have unschooling communities handily available with whom they could share experiences and ideas like we do now with list serves and email.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were homeschoolers around our town but they were the school-at-home, overtly christian variety, so in that sense, I think the whole family felt isolated and lonely, not just Astra. (There was a vibrant creative community of artists and thinkers - just not necessarily homeschoolers)<br/>\n<br/>\nShe talks about her parents creating a learning environment and facilitating them in their interests, but not guiding them per se. To me, that is the type of unschooling this list does address. Here is a quote from the article you linked to:<br/>\n&quot;What they did is, I always envision it as this sort of nutrient rich broth, and they put us in it and we grew in that. So tons of books, books on everything books on horticulture, mysticism, science, everything you could imagineâ&quot; and this was not the age of google so there was no Internet. We always had a piano, guitars, and drums. We always had pens and papers and paint. Anything you could want to create or make was there. There just wasnât formal instruction to go with it. And itâs not to say that you couldnât ask mom and dad for helpâ¦ if I hit some sort of empass I could always say, âDad could you help me figure this thing on piano.â They werenât really guiding, they were more facilitatingâ¦ helping us to figure out what is it we wanted to do.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this article:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.school-survival.net/blog/p/astra-taylor-flimmaker-talks-about-unschooling/1414\">http://www.school-survival.net/blog/p/astra-taylor-flimmaker-talks-about-unschooling/1414</a><br/>\nShe advises people interested in unschooling to,&quot;Have complete trust in your child. It&#39;s actually really hard. A lot of parents micromanage. Our parents tried not to interfere with our natural progression, not that they didn&#39;t set up an interesting environment. They trusted our intuition when we were interested in things they aren&#39;t. You don&#39;t get to choose what your children are interested in.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think this is neglect. This is staying out-of-their way and supporting and facilitating the interests they have on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nI experienced The Taylors as a family that created music, science, art and had incredibly rich and thought-provoking conversations with each other and within a larger creative community. The parents facilitated computer building projects, finding mentors, making and distributing xeroxed zines, activism, etc. for and with their children. They continue to be a loving, tight-knit family with all their children in adulthood.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that these nuanced aspects of their unschooling experience may not come across in some of Astra&#39;s writings to those people who have anecdotal and/or philosophical familiarity with unschooling. I&#39;m imagining some of her blanket statements are geared more to those people completely unfamiliar to unschooling as a concept, and she is introducing the idea of internal motivation for gaining knowledge. That is conjecture on my part however.<br/>\nThanks for the discussion.<br/>\n-Dana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;sheeboo2&quot; &lt;brmino@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---I&#39;m curious what led you to surmise that based on her other writings?

If they had questions, they were pointed to the shelves of books in the home. If she said she was bored, her mother said, &quot;Only boring people are bored.&quot; She writes about how she was often uninspired and spent her days doing little of anything exciting. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There was also an undercurrent of her parents&#39; attachment to the philosophy of anarchy that reminded more of the British &quot;Taking Children Seriously&quot; philosophy than of unschooling as is discussed here. The children&#39;s isolation (she uses that word, not me) seems as if it was a choice the parents made from an ideological standpoint without considering what their children wanted and needed. Their world was too small.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Taylor seems like one smart cookie who is doing exactly what she wants with her life. I don&#39;t think she&#39;s a bad role model, but I also don&#39;t think that leaving children to answer their own questions, to &quot;teach themselves&quot; to figure their way through bouts of boredom with belittling comments are in-line with the kind of partnerships encouraged here. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ah, here&#39;s the quote about being bored: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://citizenshift.org/node/21634&dossier_nid=20054\">http://citizenshift.org/node/21634&dossier_nid=20054</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is one of the places where she said she went to school because she was lonely:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://stillinmotion.typepad.com/still_in_motion/2008/11/interview-astra-taylor-director-examined-life.html\">http://stillinmotion.typepad.com/still_in_motion/2008/11/interview-astra-taylor-director-examined-life.html</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In talking about her desire to convert the world to veganism:  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;By the time I was twelve, I discovered that there might be some flaws in my theory.  And then, out of loneliness, I finally went to public school; I&#39;d been unschooled up until that point.

This, from Glenda (wtexans), summed it up  <br/>\nfor me.<br/>\n<br/>\n******************************<br/>\n<br/>\n  Re: &quot;Read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n From this interview: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://citizenshift.org/node/21634&dossier_nid=20054\">http://citizenshift.org/node/21634&dossier_nid=20054</a> <br/>\n, I&#39;m<br/>\nquoting the interviewee, Astra Taylor: ===What I would have loved is  <br/>\nto be an<br/>\nunschooling in an urban environment where you could go to art museums  <br/>\nand take<br/>\nawesome classes about film making when you&#39;re a kid because then you  <br/>\ncould have<br/>\nall the richness and all the social interaction but just none of the  <br/>\nbullshit <br/>\nwhich would be the best of both worlds.===<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa said: ===So, even if a parent is supportive, embracing of a child&#39;s<br/>\ninterests, trusts the child&#39;s ability to learn, etc. etc., it may be  <br/>\nthat *that*<br/>\nchild still will feel the need to escape from or be free of parents  <br/>\nand family<br/>\nonce they hit their teens and twenties.===<br/>\n<br/>\nAs others have said, I don&#39;t see her parents as having been supportive  <br/>\nor<br/>\nembracing of her interests (based on what Astra said in the  <br/>\ninterview), and it&#39;s<br/>\nnot the kind of unschooling promoted on this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf an unschooled kid is wanting to be in a more urban environment and  <br/>\nto have<br/>\naccess to art museums and film-making resources (classes certainly  <br/>\naren&#39;t the<br/>\n*only* option), a supportive parent would find ways to make that  <br/>\nhappen. Perhaps<br/>\nby moving to a more urban area, or making frequent trips to &quot;the big  <br/>\ncity&quot;. By<br/>\nsearching out resources for learning different ways to make films.  <br/>\nFinding ways<br/>\nfor that child to have the kind of social interaction they want  <br/>\nwithout school<br/>\nbeing the only option for that (as it seemed to be for Astra).<br/>\n<br/>\n From what Astra said, her wants weren&#39;t being met through  <br/>\nunschooling, and that<br/>\ncomes through in the opinion she&#39;s formed of unschooling. Think about  <br/>\nhow much<br/>\nricher of an experience unschooling could&#39;ve been for her if she had  <br/>\nbeen<br/>\nsupported in the way we define &quot;unschooling&quot; on this list.<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Astra Taylor","postDate":"1342379561","msgId":68172,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU3NTk3MUJELTE3NUEtNEM0Qi05Qjg5LTFGRDQxODM1MzJCNUBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGp0dXV0NStobWpsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGp0dXV0NStobWpsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68166,"nextInTopic":68173,"prevInTime":68171,"nextInTime":68173,"topicId":68130,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

If they had questions, they were pointed to the shelves of books in the home. If she said she was bored, her mother said, &quot;Only boring people are bored.&quot; She writes about how she was often uninspired and spent her days doing little of anything exciting. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was also an undercurrent of her parents&#39; attachment to the philosophy of anarchy that reminded more of the British &quot;Taking Children Seriously&quot; philosophy than of unschooling as is discussed here.
