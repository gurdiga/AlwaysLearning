Keith made it.  There was a circle of  <br/>\ncardboard behind me, and I  made a long ribbon version of the paper  <br/>\nthat (used to, I don&#39;t think they have them anymore) sticks out, and  <br/>\nKeith wrapped the whole thing in aluminum foil.  Marty was born two  <br/>\nweeks later.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis made it EASY for us to get unschooling.  It made it easier for  <br/>\npeople who have met our family to get unschooling.  It keeps us from  <br/>\nneeding other unschooling families as much as some people do, because  <br/>\nour longtime childless friends also make costumes and go on  <br/>\nadventures and have very cool hobbies.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone with a keen interest in the Middle Ages can do lots of stuff  <br/>\nat home, alone, but they can&#39;t eat a feast by candlelight with 200  <br/>\nothers.  They can&#39;t cook for 200 others, even.  They can  make armor,  <br/>\nbut they can&#39;t test it out without another friend in armor.

I mean it (no snarkiness<br/>\nhere).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut until such a time as one finds/meets/gathers an unschooling tribe, one<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t want to wait around for it to happen.  Karl needs people.  I moved<br/>\nfrom TN with a grand tribe... a fun bunch of people!  Wow.  To upstate SC<br/>\nwhere unschoolers don&#39;t appear to be thriving.  If I&#39;m wrong please correct<br/>\nme!  I don&#39;t see why it&#39;s like that.  There&#39;s some great unschoolers here.<br/>\nAnd in the meantime until a tribe is gathered, there are others to infect<br/>\nwith the &quot;fun&quot; bug if I can.  If not maybe in the process of looking, I can<br/>\nrun into a circle of unschoolers to hang with.  The communities are *much*<br/>\nmore far flung in my area than that in TN, and that may be why I don&#39;t know<br/>\nbut a handful where I&#39;m living now.  Plus I&#39;ve only been back here this<br/>\nsummer and it was really hot weather for going to park days.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome unschoolers I&#39;ve met are more resigned with their *not*<br/>\nunschooling-friendly crowd than happy.  So many of them seem to feel<br/>\nobligated to be around extended family and other folk who don&#39;t seem to ever<br/>\nwant to get it.  Some have spouses unfriendly to unschooling.  Many don&#39;t<br/>\nknow how to keep their spirits from flagging.  I know.  Blah blah blah..<br/>\nproblems problems.  I am determined to be happy and I know it may take time<br/>\nto find like minded people in my area and lots of relaxing into the social<br/>\nscene (let&#39;s face it I&#39;ve not pushed myself too hard and it *is* a skill).<br/>\nUntil now ... if it was easy (TN), I did well -- if it&#39;s not, I&#39;m tempted to<br/>\nget like an absent minded professor and burrow down into my well-entrenched<br/>\nwarren a little more deeply.  Don&#39;t want to go back to doing that.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 9/11/08, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I can&#39;t find the thread.
