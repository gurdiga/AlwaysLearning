I went on to The Happy Hollisters for a while, because one could subscribe and get one a month at home.  That was a family with five children and they solved mysteries on family vacations. :-)   I still have them, but generally they do NOT translate to modern days.  I tried reading one to Holly, years back, because it was set in New Mexico.  It bugged the heck out of her and I was embarrassed that it hadn&#39;t bugged me when I was her age, for being condescending about local characters.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBUT!   The mysteries were cool.  And the fact that her dad would give her realworld help and her best friend was on call and her boyfriend would deliver something to her without needing to hang around and be dramatic were good fantasies.  And she had her own car.  (I&#39;ve heard the car changed over the years, and that for a while (perhaps, and maybe still) they were updated with a program that had flagged the dated bits (clothes, car) so they could be modernized.  That might have been urban legend, or it might have been true, because search and replace were very cool in the 1980&#39;s and 90&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey were exciting for me when I was a kid the way modern crime dramas like The Mentalist and any of the Sherlock Holmes TV shows / movies are cool.  Logic, danger, luck, clever discovery, dependable associates...  Quite an exercise in trying to guess what&#39;s next, or looking back at what might&#39;ve been better.  I learned trivia about different parts of the world, too, from Nancy Drew and other kid-mystery books.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow kids play Nancy Drew video games, and other mystery stories they can interact with and affect, and conservatives whose team once reviled the books now claims the books would be good for kids, but the games are damaging. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":251210887,"authorName":"","from":"&lt;shirarocklin@...&gt;","profile":"shirarocklin","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"RE: Good for you","postDate":"1388586847","msgId":73062,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGxhMTkwditiYWdrNXBAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEM2REI3MjQ0LTczNzAtNDQ5Qy1CMjkzLUJCQTk2Qzc2MzdFN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEM2REI3MjQ0LTczNzAtNDQ5Qy1CMjkzLUJCQTk2Qzc2MzdFN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":73053,"nextInTopic":73063,"prevInTime":73061,"nextInTime":73063,"topicId":73053,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I was just reading a book about the history of Nancy Drew and her authors.
