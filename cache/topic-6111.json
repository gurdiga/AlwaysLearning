I can only tell you the<br/>\n&gt; direction we took.  My daughter started dance and gymnastics when <br/>\nshe<br/>\n&gt; was 3 years old.  As she got a little older it became clear that<br/>\n&gt; performing on a stage was the biggest focus in her life.  She <br/>\nattended a<br/>\n&gt; few summer camp drama programs and fell in love even more.  She <br/>\nadded<br/>\n&gt; competitive cheerleading, circus club, trapeze and a couple of other<br/>\n&gt; skills to her repetoire, and I began to take her love for this more<br/>\n&gt; seriously.  I think a huge turning point for us was discovering our<br/>\n&gt; local homeschool theatre group.  Her reading was always her weak <br/>\npoint.<br/>\n&gt; She learned to read in public school, but while my boys got great<br/>\n&gt; reading skills from school, she never seemed to catch on.  Her first<br/>\n&gt; audition with this theatre group was so horribly bad that when I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; get a call from the director, I assumed she hadn&#39;t been cast.  We <br/>\nmissed<br/>\n&gt; the first rehearsal, but Jeanne called us and got us into the group.<br/>\n&gt; Chelsea had a small, but good character part, and performed very <br/>\nwell.<br/>\n&gt; The next season she was cast as Amy in Little Women.  Somewhere <br/>\nalong<br/>\n&gt; the line I got the name of a very reputable agent who books kids in<br/>\n&gt; commercials, print work, television, etc.  We had to wait months <br/>\nfor her<br/>\n&gt; next audition date, but Chelsea did land a contract with her.  We <br/>\nalso<br/>\n&gt; found out where open auditions were posted in the paper and started<br/>\n&gt; going to those.  We started big - a Debbie Allen audition with 500-<br/>\n600<br/>\n&gt; kids.  It was a great experience.  She knew after sitting through <br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; one that she really loved doing it.  She got a call-back - great <br/>\nfor her<br/>\n&gt; confidence - but was not cast.  We&#39;ve learned so much in this <br/>\nprocess -<br/>\n&gt; how to win, how to lose, huge amounts about the technicalities and <br/>\nworld<br/>\n&gt; of theatre, that small character parts can be just as much of a <br/>\nlearning<br/>\n&gt; experience as big parts, and most importantly, to be selective <br/>\nabout the<br/>\n&gt; parts you take once you&#39;ve gained some experience.  She&#39;s done <br/>\nenough<br/>\n&gt; auditions to know which type she&#39;ll get call-backs for and which she<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t.  She got a call-back for Debbie Allen because it was dance <br/>\nheavy.<br/>\n&gt; She didn&#39;t get a call-back for the Broadway/Disney Lion King <br/>\naudition<br/>\n&gt; because it was singing heavy.  Now she takes voice lessons!  As far <br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; starting a homeschool theatre group, it&#39;s a great idea but tons and <br/>\ntons<br/>\n&gt; of work.  I assist the director of our group now, and there&#39;s no <br/>\nway to<br/>\n&gt; describe the hours and energy it takes to put on a quality <br/>\nperformance.<br/>\n&gt; But if that&#39;s what both of you love, the idea may be just up your <br/>\nalley.<br/>\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t recommend making it free though - it can get expensive to<br/>\n&gt; produce a good show, and you have to pay for it somehow.  I would <br/>\nmake<br/>\n&gt; the tickets cheap if you have factors that keep you from producing a<br/>\n&gt; totally professional show, such as a church location rather than a<br/>\n&gt; professional theatre, or a lack of directing experience, or a small<br/>\n&gt; group of kids to start.  I&#39;m not trying to discourage you at all - I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know what we would have done if Kathleen and Jeanne hadn&#39;t <br/>\nstarted<br/>\n&gt; this wonderful group.

And sometimes those off-beat<br/>\nthespians are great weird and sometimes bad weird.  It sounds like your<br/>\ndaughter is pretty committed to theatre.  I can only tell you the<br/>\ndirection we took.  My daughter started dance and gymnastics when she<br/>\nwas 3 years old.  As she got a little older it became clear that<br/>\nperforming on a stage was the biggest focus in her life.  She attended a<br/>\nfew summer camp drama programs and fell in love even more.  She added<br/>\ncompetitive cheerleading, circus club, trapeze and a couple of other<br/>\nskills to her repetoire, and I began to take her love for this more<br/>\nseriously.  I think a huge turning point for us was discovering our<br/>\nlocal homeschool theatre group.  Her reading was always her weak point.<br/>\nShe learned to read in public school, but while my boys got great<br/>\nreading skills from school, she never seemed to catch on.  Her first<br/>\naudition with this theatre group was so horribly bad that when I didn&#39;t<br/>\nget a call from the director, I assumed she hadn&#39;t been cast.  We missed<br/>\nthe first rehearsal, but Jeanne called us and got us into the group.<br/>\nChelsea had a small, but good character part, and performed very well.<br/>\nThe next season she was cast as Amy in Little Women.  Somewhere along<br/>\nthe line I got the name of a very reputable agent who books kids in<br/>\ncommercials, print work, television, etc.  We had to wait months for her<br/>\nnext audition date, but Chelsea did land a contract with her.  We also<br/>\nfound out where open auditions were posted in the paper and started<br/>\ngoing to those.  We started big - a Debbie Allen audition with 500-600<br/>\nkids.  It was a great experience.  She knew after sitting through that<br/>\none that she really loved doing it.  She got a call-back - great for her<br/>\nconfidence - but was not cast.  We&#39;ve learned so much in this process -<br/>\nhow to win, how to lose, huge amounts about the technicalities and world<br/>\nof theatre, that small character parts can be just as much of a learning<br/>\nexperience as big parts, and most importantly, to be selective about the<br/>\nparts you take once you&#39;ve gained some experience.  She&#39;s done enough<br/>\nauditions to know which type she&#39;ll get call-backs for and which she<br/>\nwon&#39;t.  She got a call-back for Debbie Allen because it was dance heavy.<br/>\nShe didn&#39;t get a call-back for the Broadway/Disney Lion King audition<br/>\nbecause it was singing heavy.  Now she takes voice lessons!  As far as<br/>\nstarting a homeschool theatre group, it&#39;s a great idea but tons and tons<br/>\nof work.
