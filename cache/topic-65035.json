Sometimes it&#39;s parental control (personality, or having been controlled and passing it on like hazing).

And going way back you see Jains, Buddhists and &quot;Hindus&quot; (or one of the different groups that get lumped into this term) fighting one another. Difference and violence has a long history and no religion seems to be free of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe caste system is also quite complex and varies depending on region and religion. There is an argument that caste became more relevant because of the British and the implementation of a census: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Castes-Mind-Colonialism-Making-Modern/dp/0691088950\">http://www.amazon.com/Castes-Mind-Colonialism-Making-Modern/dp/0691088950</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe way I think about religion in India is that people believe in gods, goddesses, spirits, forces, etc or ordinary enlightened living beings. Those believers practice their &quot;religion&quot; in thousands of ways (who knows probably more there&#39;s a billion or so people there). These practices can overlap among groups and you even see &quot;Hindus&quot; and &quot;Muslims&quot; going to the same spiritual pilgrimage site. In the same way you see different castes going to the same sites and performing the same practices.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;Hinduism&quot; concept that emerged during the British colonial period was definitely created in collaboration with people living in what&#39;s South Asia. They needed these people to translate all the texts and learn about what they were doing on the ground, and those people went to British colleges and worked with the British to learn about how to assert their own power.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;What I heard in India, then, that seemed to relate to that, was that the strict vegetarianism was for Brahmins.

When I was in India, I heard something for the first time ever.  It tied in (as things do) with something I had read a year before that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of Christianity being and all-or-nothing religion, when the Brits took India and started writing about it, they needed to call the religion one thing.    So &quot;Hindu&quot; is the name of &quot;the religion&quot; but really, what the Brits described as a caste system within that religion might have been more a set of practices and traditions within an over-arching culture, so that it would have been more like different castes having &quot;different religions,&quot; if the English could&#39;ve seen it that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo &quot;Hinduism&quot; is a British amalgamation of what they saw that wasn&#39;t Moslem or Christian-from-the-Portuguese, maybe.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I heard in India, then, that seemed to relate to that, was that the strict vegetarianism was for Brahmins.

So each of us gets to raise our kids within the framework of our own religious - or other - convictions, but also to respect the freedom of the children to make their own choices as they grow up.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are Christians, so I write from this perspective....<br/>\n<br/>\nI think matters of religion are the same as most other things... small kids tend to want to do what their parents do; as they enter the teens they start finding that they have opinions of their own and that sometimes these opinions are different. This is the stage at which parents often clamp down on the kids - and in the long run I think they then stand a higher chance of the child not following those convictions in the end, because they never got to decide for themselves if they agreed or not. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is tough if you feel strongly about something to allow others, especially significant others, the freedom to differ. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think fear has something to do with it too - the fear that the other person will not follow our faith, along with all the possible consequences of that, and/or reject me and not love ME anymore because I still do follow that faith. <br/>\n<br/>\nControl is always at the cost of relationship. So the chances of the above happening are actually higher if you clamp down than if you take a &#39;lighter&#39;, discursive, mentoring kind of approach. <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving said all that, there is also, I think, a place for a person (any person, not just a child) in the family to say &#39;This is really important to me, so please do/don&#39;t do it&#39;. And for the other person to comply even if it is not particularly important to them, for the sake of the relationship. If something is offensive to the parents, and to their way of doing things, they should be free to say so - and explain why. Same with the children. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, friends of ours always enjoyed Christmas and all its traditions. But their daughter, as she grew up, became convinced that the Christmas tree was a &#39;pagan&#39; symbol and did not want them to have one anymore. Her parents did not agree at all, but after much conversation, agreed that they would not have a Christmas tree in their home as long as their daughter continued to live with them - because it was against her convictions. So it works both ways, not just for what the parents want.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose some things are just irreconcilable though - as shown by the multitude of religious wars over the centuries. An example would be if a child in a Christian/Jewish family - ie no &#39;idols&#39; - chose to follow a religion such as Hinduism, which does have &#39;idols&#39;. If a family finds themselves in such a place, I don&#39;t know what they should do. Try above all things to keep the love between them anyway. See what compromises are available. If the child is old enough to leave home, then he probably should - and then he can practise his religion without either party being offended...<br/>\n<br/>\nWith younger children, I found that they are happy if they understand the &#39;why&#39; of what the parents choose. So from a religious perspective, if you explain simply that we do/don&#39;t do such and such because of this belief/tradition/religious text, that usually serves to satisfy. To use Christmas again - sorry, but this example works - we chose not to celebrate Santa at Christmas, but rather to remember him on St Nicholas day and to keep Christmas as a festival focused on Jesus. Of course questions were asked by the children, as most of their friends got presents from Santa Claus. We simply explained that we wanted the focus to be on the Nativity and the gift God gave us, and so we didn&#39;t want to do things the same way as our friends. This was fine with them, and has never been an issue. <br/>\nI think that often we create the problems when we don&#39;t allow the children the freedom to ask questions and to try to understand for themselves why a tradition/religious practise is important.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think though, that we need to allow our children, in the name of &#39;freedom&#39; to walk roughshod over convictions that we ourselves hold dear. One of the wonderful things that undergirds unschooling philosophy is the quality of mutual respect: &#39;I respect and value your personhood (that includes who you are, what you believe, how you feel). You do the same for me.&#39; <br/>\n<br/>\nIn our home, anyone is free to - and does - make a call on that quality - &#39;When you did such and such I felt disrespected and this is why....&#39; <br/>\n<br/>\nWe try really hard to live by these precepts; it is not always easy to do so though.... there is nothing straightforward about convictions. I used to think such problems could and should be easily solved - as I grow older I see how complex they actually are, and how much tragic division they can bring. It is a crazy thought to me to think that here, in the UK, so many people have been put to death for religious convictions, convictions which did not really differ that much from each other in the overall picture (all were Christians!), but which differed greatly in the details - which to my mind were (are) not that important at all.... more a place of &#39;If it seems good to you, then do it&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m rambling now, so I&#39;ll stop!<br/>\nCathy<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.Christian-unschooling.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":251210887,"authorName":"shirarocklin","from":"&quot;shirarocklin&quot; &lt;shirarocklin@...&gt;","profile":"shirarocklin","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Religion and food choices","postDate":"1326719651","msgId":65076,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpmMTdyMytldHQ1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGpmMGxidStxZ2hkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65075,"nextInTopic":65077,"prevInTime":65075,"nextInTime":65077,"topicId":65035,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It was deal-making, political, more than individual decision.  A nation could &quot;be Christian&quot; for quite a while without much knowledge of what that meant.  Dietary restrictions weren&#39;t a part of any of that, except fish on Fridays in some areas, and other areas were eating fish much of the time anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a story of fish on Fridays having been solidified by the Pope at the request/pressure of fishermen in the Mediterranean.  I don&#39;t know where it is right now or how valid it is, but a great deal of what is done within a large church that should perhaps have adopted more of the Old Testament (Moslems picked up the pork restriction) had to do with practicalities and realities.  No printing press, few translations, untrained priests, lack of communication, fear of uprising, compromises.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a Saxon version of the Bible that cast Jesus as a warrior and the apostles as his sword brothers, his happy warrior companions, because the people wouldn&#39;t have been impressed or swayed At ALL by any fishermen or shepherds.  I seriously doubt there was any consideration of making them warriors who wouldn&#39;t eat pork, in Germania.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s called The Heliand, and is a really fun read.  G. Ronald Murphy translated the edition I have.  He&#39;s a Jesuit scholar and the notes are as wonderful as the text.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Heliand-Gospel-G-Ronald-Murphy/dp/0195073762\">http://www.amazon.com/Heliand-Gospel-G-Ronald-Murphy/dp/0195073762</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliand\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliand</a><br/>\nOnce the Germanic tribes were Christian, though, and they were travelling into places that were also, some of the, recently Christian, it was an awkward time for anyone to come along and say &quot;Oh, look!  We just noticed this detail about pigs....&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was no Bible as we have now, no full set of approved books in a certain order available to buy. Not even nearly.  And as is common in many cultures who live near each other but kind of wish they didn&#39;t, differences were noted.  And just as circumcision and non-circumcision was a huge deal, so was pork eating and not, in a way.  They do this, we don&#39;t.  That&#39;s how we&#39;re different.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so even with unschooling families, sometimes that &quot;We are different/better/cleaner/more evolved because we do this, and they do that&quot; has a solid historical and anthropological justification.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn India there are people who don&#39;t eat any garlic.

I thought briefly of asking him &quot;So... what do you think Ganesha would like, from this limited array?&quot;  But I looked at his wife, and she had her head covered and long sleeves and a long dress, and I decided they were likely Moslem and I wouldn&#39;t ask them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople like to be set apart, even unschoolers, even within and among other unschoolers sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Religion and food choices","postDate":"1326711635","msgId":65071,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDczNjVFRDU0LTUxNzEtNEM4NC05MDQwLTBFQjdGNzBDQkY1NkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpmMGxidStxZ2hkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpmMGxidStxZ2hkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65069,"nextInTopic":65075,"prevInTime":65070,"nextInTime":65072,"topicId":65035,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I have explained to my kids that there are some animals that God created to be food and some that he did not create to be food, and that part of loving ourselves is to not eat things that he did not design to be eaten.  I don&#39;t make it about their relationship with him or make it out to be a big deal.  It&#39;s just matter of fact- We don&#39;t eat dog, we don&#39;t eat horse, we don&#39;t eat pig.  I sympathize with them that it is frustrating to live in a culture that does eat pork and then focus on finding alternatives.  My oldest is only 6, but once they are old enough that they are going places by themselves and buying and eating food without my input, it will be their choice.  My job is to provide them with the information, introduce them to a relationship with God, and support them as they study and learn for themselves- NOT to try to make them perfect or be the voice of God to them.    <br/>\n<br/>\nEmily</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Religion and food choices","postDate":"1326651016","msgId":65043,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY3MDYxMjRBLUIzNEQtNEQ3Ni1BNDlELTFDQkZBQzNFNzVDOUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBRFJoMGVfaU1fSDFabUYwQVBvOENqX3JhZ2ViUE12S3ZOQlowZlQ9UW5yTHZXQyt5d0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGpldW43biszZ2xpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8Q0FEUmgwZV9pTV9IMVptRjBBUG84Q2pfcmFnZWJQTXZLdk5CWjBmVD1RbnJMdldDK3l3QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65041,"nextInTopic":65069,"prevInTime":65042,"nextInTime":65044,"topicId":65035,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The principle of not eating pork can swirl around her. It can be part of what guides you and your husband in the choices you make for your family. When it comes up, you can talk about why you make that choice and show her the ingredient list and other ways you gather information to help you decide. She may not make The Choice to avoid all pork products right now, but she can think each time and decide.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour husband is right in that she can benefit from your wisdom right now. But he&#39;s wrong in thinking she must be guided toward something in order to embrace it. She can live with you and the choices you make, absorb what you do.
