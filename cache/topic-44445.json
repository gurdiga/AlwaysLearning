Her friend&#39;s parents thanked us for giving him an outlet for<br/>\n&gt; those &quot;weird&quot; pictures he likes to draw. My son has created his own little world that he lives in with his best bud. We have relaxed and realized that we are here to love and guide, that school is so unnecessary especially school at home. Family and friend support has been close to nil, actually we have chosen not to let their negativity affect us and our decisions. We might have a year ago but now our confidence that we are doing the best thing for our family has built up. We still have days that we second guess and question our decision. We still have days where we revert to parenting the old way, but they are becoming fewer and far between. I do not expect to have perfect days everyday. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I found I do not have to include what they like or are passionate about<br/>\n&gt; in my list of things that I enjoy, however, I love their passion, their<br/>\n&gt; enjoyment. I include them in the things that I love to do and I am<br/>\n&gt; passionate about. Sometimes it is just curiosity to see what mommy is<br/>\n&gt; up to and sometimes they actually enjoy the activity and other times<br/>\n&gt; they just sit and we talk about things while I work on projects.
