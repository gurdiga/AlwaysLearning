I actually ate <br/>\nmostly sugary cereal growing up. I can&#39;t ever remember eating what <br/>\nwould be considered &quot;healthy&quot; cereal. No bran flakes, so shredded <br/>\nwheat, etc. I ate Fruity Pebbles, Cap&#39;n Crunch (all three kinds!) and <br/>\nFruit Loops, Coco Crispies, etc.  And I STILL love all of them!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich brings me to the wonder part. Though I hadn&#39;t let my kids eat <br/>\nwhatever they wanted to whenever they wanted to prior to my decision <br/>\nto do so a few months ago, I still wasn&#39;t very picky with what they <br/>\nate. So they had &quot;sweets&quot; after ever meal, often before meals, and any <br/>\ntime I had some. I would simply say &quot;I think you&#39;ve had enough&quot; <br/>\nafterwards if they asked for more than I was comfortable with.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when halloween came this year, it played out the same as every <br/>\nyear. I&#39;ve never told them to only eat a few pieces of candy, because <br/>\nI figured the more they eat, the sooner it&#39;s gone and I don&#39;t have to <br/>\nhear them ask, &quot;Can I have more?&quot; They had free access to their candy <br/>\nand I would always answer &quot;yes&quot; when they asked for more. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll three years (as long as we&#39;ve been getting candy) they&#39;ve dove in <br/>\nand don&#39;t stop until the candy is gone. Which I don&#39;t mind, at all. <br/>\nBut I do know of people on this board or the food pages on Sandra&#39;s <br/>\nsite, or even friends off-line whose children eat lots of candy at <br/>\nfirst, then stop and leave the rest to be forgotten eventually. Even <br/>\nmy friend who limits her children&#39;s sweets, once she gave in and said, <br/>\n&quot;Just eat as much as you want!&quot; they ate a few pieces, and then <br/>\nstopped.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far, my kids have not stopped as far as a whole day goes. In other <br/>\nwords, they&#39;ll eat 3, 5, 7 pieces, then stop for awhile, then hours <br/>\nlater do the same again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre some children more likely to enjoy sugary things than others? Am I <br/>\nstill somehow giving off a vibe that they are picking up that might <br/>\ncause them to hoard vs. just enjoy bit by bit?<br/>\n<br/>\nAt Thanksgiving, my kids were the only ones not forced into eating the <br/>\nfoods on their plates or the selection offered. But they also were the <br/>\nonly ones eating more dessert than main dishes. And that&#39;s pretty <br/>\ntypical with them. Since I don&#39;t get to see other children who choose <br/>\ntheir own food, I&#39;m wondering if this is normal fare for younger kids, <br/>\nor if they are still on the journey (2 months in) of phasing out of <br/>\ncontrolled eating. I guess I thought that since I hadn&#39;t been very <br/>\nstrict before, that it wouldn&#39;t be a huge change to their diet. And as <br/>\nfor the &quot;healthy&quot; foods, that part hasn&#39;t changed. They still eat <br/>\npretty much what they did before. It&#39;s just the sweets have increased <br/>\nto probably about double. They don&#39;t eat it all day, and I&#39;m fine with <br/>\nthe amount of healthy food they DO get. I just still have that voice <br/>\nin my mind saying, &quot;But look at all the candy they&#39;re eating!&quot; They <br/>\nwill eat other foods if offered, but then usually ask for the sweets <br/>\nafterwards (&quot;Do you want grapes/banana/pear?&quot; &quot;YES!!!&quot; :eat: &quot;Can I <br/>\nstill have chocolate?&quot; &quot;Sure...&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"breakfast cereal, was Re: A family from another state visits","postDate":"1228073904","msgId":40652,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlFRkZEMDA3LUI5NzctNEFGNi04MEVELTY3MTZGRjY1MjQ1OEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEM1NTgzRTZELjU1QkUyJWVtaWx5am9AZW1pbHlqby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PEM1NTgzRTZELjU1QkUyJWVtaWx5am9AZW1pbHlqby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":40649,"nextInTopic":40660,"prevInTime":40651,"nextInTime":40653,"topicId":40610,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-fluffernutter quesadillas.-=- Sounds TERRIBLE with cheese.

You&#39;re  <br/>\nbeing weak because you can&#39;t say no.

Kids often do grow up to eat less  <br/>\njunk and watch less TV. Often it&#39;s because their tastes change. They  <br/>\ndon&#39;t need the high calorie foods in their 20&#39;s. (What percentage of  <br/>\nadults who were allowed to eat Cap&#39;n Crunch as kids still like it?  <br/>\nJust the thought of it makes me gag as an adult ;-) So from the  <br/>\nresults it *seems* like the kids who would cram in the junk were  <br/>\ntrained properly to not eat it by parents who did the hard and right  <br/>\nthing of saying no to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course some grow up to grab as much as they can of the stuff that  <br/>\nwas controlled -- and often feel guilty and wrong about it even as  <br/>\nthey feel right about being able to choose without someone hovering  <br/>\nover them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, of course, unschoolers know from experience that the conclusions  <br/>\nare false.

The worst that<br/>\ncan happen is not sharing uncomfortable dinners. Express your respect<br/>\nfor his choice (traditional school) to educate and raise his child the<br/>\nway he does, even though you do not personally think it is &quot;the best&quot;<br/>\noption. Explain that you expect the same respect for yourself and your<br/>\nchild, though he may not think your choice (homeschool) is &quot;the best&quot;<br/>\noption. Mention that you do not force your &quot;homeschooling&quot; methods on<br/>\nto his child (though such a concept is of course ridiculous), and you<br/>\nwould prefer he not force his &quot;schooling&quot; methods (quiz-led<br/>\nconversation) on to your child.<br/>\nI have to admit that I have responded in a wide range of ways to<br/>\npeople quizzing my son. But I think that it is important also to<br/>\nremember that many adults do not have very good communication skills,<br/>\nespecially when it comes to communication with children. Most people<br/>\nask kids what they are learning in school, and quiz them based on<br/>\nfacts that they (the adult) know. We have to remember that it can be<br/>\ndifficult for adults to learn new ways of interacting, which in turn<br/>\ncauses the adult to feel uncomfortable. And we should feel comfortable<br/>\neducating adults --gently-- on our preference for real conversation,<br/>\nnot q&a&#39;s. I find that it is helpful to assume that people are unsure<br/>\nof how the act/react towards my son. Even if, in truth, they are being<br/>\nclose-minded and judgmental it helps me to not respond defensively,<br/>\nnor judgmentally. As long as my son isn&#39;t uncomfortable, there isn&#39;t a<br/>\nreal problem. Usually, the other adult is AS uncomfortable, or MORE<br/>\nuncomfortable, then I am. My son is usually fine. I admit to steering<br/>\nthe conversation at times, though I&#39;m getting better about not doing<br/>\nthat as much now. For instance, when my mother (who is in favor of<br/>\nhomeschooling, actually) starts asking him questions &quot;quizzing&quot; (she<br/>\nis a school teacher, so she gets in that mindset) on multiplication<br/>\n(not his strong point) I toss in a comment about something fun he<br/>\nlearned recently. &quot;Ask Grandma about positive and negative integers.&quot;<br/>\nStill math, but something that he enjoys. Plus, then he can show her<br/>\nwhat he knows by asking her questions, and/or giving her math problems<br/>\nto solve. I have to hold my tongue alot, because although I don&#39;t<br/>\nreally like the rapid-fire questioning approach, my son seems to like<br/>\nthe challenge, even when he doesn&#39;t know the answer. He doesn&#39;t mind<br/>\nlearning from people, and he doesn&#39;t mind saying he doesn&#39;t know. <br/>\nAs long as you are confident about what you are doing, other people<br/>\neventually will be, too. Granted, with some people it might take a<br/>\nfull 20 years before they realize that what you were doing with you<br/>\nchild turned out just fine.<br/>\nBest wishes.<br/>\nNyna<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;halfshadow1&quot; &lt;halfshadow1@...&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I had my brother/his wife and ten year old daughter visit today.
