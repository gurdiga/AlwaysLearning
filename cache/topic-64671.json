In a room opening to one side, younger kids were playing (though some were in the room with their parents) and in a similar room to the other side were games, tables, and a-few-to-several people playing video games on laptops<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is exactly what I would love to have happening over here in Australia! Exactly this! <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have had a so called Unschoolers conference in Australia recently, of which I didn’t attend. Without being too critical of the organisers etc it should really have been called the Woo Woo Unschoolers conference. It had such a new age/woo woo saturation and I could tell, from the speakers listed, that it wasn’t going to be my cup of tea. Now they are talking about having another one next year but calling it Shift. It seems to me that it’s way more about the spiritual woo stuff and way not about real unschooling. I wish they would’ve called it that from the start and not confused so many people about unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince then there’s been a facebook group set up for people far more interested in the real nuts and bolts unschooling, with some people feeling a little jilted by the whole so called unschooling movement over here. I said on that group, just the other day, that we need Sandra to come on over here and straighten out the unschoolers! When I read all about the Unschooling Symposium that is happening in Albuquerque right now I feel so very, very envious and wish I could fly right over and join you all. <br/>\n<br/>\nI’m hoping that 2012 will be a better year in Australia for unschoolers. We so need more enthusiasm and encouragement over here as there’s no one really making much of a deal about it, yet...<br/>\nEnjoy your final day of the symposium.<br/>\n<br/>\nKind Wishes<br/>\nKim <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Sandra Dodd <br/>\nSent: Saturday, December 31, 2011 1:13 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Report from Albuquerque (ALL Unschooling Symposium)<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nSome of the regular readers and contributors to the list are asleep (or quietly awake) in the same hotel I&#39;m in this morning.
