It&#39;s an idea which comes from teaching rather than from seeing how people (including children) learn. Kids do want to know how their bodies work - although the specifics of what they want to know and how they prefer to learn it will vary a great deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also implies that understanding how the body works is necessary for eating well and/or being healthy - and that&#39;s not true at all. If anything I&#39;ve experienced exactly the opposite; people can get so tangled up with different &quot;facts&quot; about foods and health and eating as to create health problems. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I asked my 15 year old out of the blue yesterday about how he eats, and if<br/>\n&gt; he feels he needs protein when he has actual hunger. He definitely does.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My daughter knows in a general sort of way that protein is one of the building blocks of living tissue - it&#39;s a subject which has come up a time or two. Most recently it came up when discussing whether werewolves could be vegetarians. Dogs can be vegetarians, but not cats because their bodies need a particular protein which is only available by eating meat. So we decided that while werewolves could be vegetarians, were-cats could not. Maybe my science was a little shaky, there, but you get the idea ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSome days she gets up and has something sweet right away. If she&#39;s too hungry she can&#39;t stomach anything really solid and a sweet will help kick start her appetite. Then she usually goes for something with protein, but she doesn&#39;t think of it that way. She likes something wants something like milk or cheese or an egg-taco, or french toast. Or cookies - George&#39;s home-made cookies are multi-grain and made with nut-meal, so that&#39;s a protein, if you want to be picky about it. She does that without fussing over the details of ingredients and carbs versus proteins versus whatever - she eats when she is hungry and if she&#39;s Too hungry, she knows she needs to do something about that. Not because she&#39;s been taught, but because she and I worked it out together way back when she was little and woke up grumpy, or played so hard she forgot to eat and got grumpy. We both learned, together, what helped her get her needs met. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s 11, by the way, and in the next few days we&#39;ll be getting her a new trampoline. She spends so much time on hers she has worn it out - I didn&#39;t know that could happen. So I suppose you could say she&#39;s athletic. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":439465581,"authorName":"Robert and Colleen","from":"&quot;Robert and Colleen&quot; &lt;3potatoes@...&gt;","profile":"trespotatoes","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Re: De-fooding","postDate":"1356217574","msgId":69929,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNzYwMWNkZTA5OCRmMTMyNTFiMCRkMzk2ZjUxMCRAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDRGREQ2RjlGLTcyODctNEY5Ri1BOTA0LTM2RDFCQTI5QjY3OUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGtiNDJxcys0MDNjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NEZERDZGOUYtNzI4Ny00RjlGLUE5MDQtMzZEMUJBMjlCNjc5QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69921,"nextInTopic":69931,"prevInTime":69928,"nextInTime":69930,"topicId":69876,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"****My children , now 27 and 17, grew up healthy and have never, as it turned out, had much interest in foods customarily deemed unhealthy.

Anyone who has actually ever been hungry, when there wasn&#39;t even baloney or a hot dog or an egg in the refrigerator, at least had a refrigerator.

That skews parents understanding and expectation by creating a self-fulfilling prophecy: &quot;obviously&quot; kids need to be taught and pushed and motivated and limited, based on their behavior when the teaching and limiting is removed. That&#39;s why experienced unschoolers recommend parents transition slowly, saying yes more rather than dumping all their old parenting ideas at once. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Why not teach the children the truth?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The most fundamental principle of unschooling is that learning is personal. Teaching never, ever guarantees what another person will learn because one can never, ever control the perceptions and perspectives of another person. So teaching Anything is problematic, and truth? Talk about a can of worms... even narrowing &quot;truth&quot; down to &quot;facts about nutrition&quot; is problematic because different bodies have different needs and those needs change over time. All four members of my immediate family have different dietary needs, different preferences, sensitivities, etc. Where food is concerned, there&#39;s no overarching &quot;truth&quot; in my home. <br/>\n<br/>\nHappily, it&#39;s not necessary to teach kids about food. It&#39;s possible to live with them, providing variety and information as they explore their interests and preferences. Kids are curious about the world! They want to know about bodies and what goes into them, what makes them energetic and strong. They want to have the strength and verve to pursue their interests to the fullest. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want more details about how that looks in real life, keep reading - there are many people on this list with years of experience with kids who&#39;ve never been taught how to eat yet are very healthy indeed. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"Alex Polikowsky","from":"Alex Polikowsky &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: De-fooding","postDate":"1356131912","msgId":69899,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVEQjU4REJBLTgwNkQtNDc4OS04NEE2LTkwNjRDOEU0QjkyMkB5YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGtiMnBsZStuZWhsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtiMnBsZStuZWhsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69898,"nextInTopic":69900,"prevInTime":69898,"nextInTime":69900,"topicId":69876,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yes!!

Make every meal<br/>\ntogether, and let her do some pealing of the potatoes, cutting of the<br/>\ncarrots, and sample as you go. Try them raw, then cooked, then talk about<br/>\nthe difference in flavors when it changes concistency. Try to make homemade<br/>\npancakes instead of boxed ones, and she may preffer those instead of<br/>\nmcdonalds. Try the salty ketchup with homemade fries, and talk about how<br/>\nfunny that she likes to salt the ketchup instead of the fries, make a game,<br/>\nyou salt your fries, and dip them in fresh ketchup and let her have a<br/>\ntaste, she may change her mind...<br/>\nI honestly will say that I haven&#39;t let go all together my food<br/>\n&quot;restrictions&quot; because of some fears, so I myself will be reading some of<br/>\nthe books suggested. I just don&#39;t buy snacks that aren&#39;t healthy (in my<br/>\nopinion) or to sugary (in my opinion) to keep them in the house. If my<br/>\npantry is filled with healthy choices of sweets, they can have all they<br/>\nwant. When we are out and they want a candy, I try suggesting a chocolate<br/>\ninstead. I dnt say u can&#39;t have the hard candy, I say &quot;ohh boy that<br/>\nchocolate does look good&quot; I tnk I will have one myself, and usually they go<br/>\nfor the &quot;healthier (in my opinion) kind of sweet. They have had hard candy<br/>\nthough when they choose it still, but they will ask me &quot;mom, which one is<br/>\nbetter out of these ones?&quot;<br/>\nSo, although I am not the perfect candidate to give you advice on how to<br/>\nlet her have anything she wants, I can advice you with perhaps inviting her<br/>\nin the kitchen... it works very well for me.

You<br/>\ndon&#39;t know whether a question will lead to a long conversation or<br/>\nwhether she&#39;ll change the topic. Let food be that way, too. She might<br/>\ndecide she loves pizza, or mac and cheese, and want that every day for<br/>\nmonths. Or she might try one taste and decide not to try it again for<br/>\na year. Find a way to appreciate that, rather than to see it as a<br/>\nheartbreak situation.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI really love the way she put that, and I would like to offer some<br/>\nspecific strategies for helping your child (maybe) branch out from her<br/>\nfew favorites:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Offer the new with the old. One thing you might try is to offer<br/>\nsomething new and either similar or complementary (or just interesting<br/>\nor delicious) along with the familiar, beloved, old favorite food<br/>\nstuff.   It&#39;s the approach those online businesses like Amazon use:<br/>\nyou suggest new stuff based on past purchases.  Give her what she asks<br/>\nfor, of course, and, at the same time, offer something new that you<br/>\nare genuinely excited about her trying (although I wouldn&#39;t recommend<br/>\nmaking a big deal of it). For instance, put out several different<br/>\ntypes of fresh berries or some cut-up tropical fruit along with the<br/>\nartificial fruit-tasting candy she requested. Or modify a well-loved<br/>\ndish somewhat, BUT only if you believe the addition/modification will<br/>\nmake the dish more delectable. (And if possible reserve an unchanged<br/>\nportion of the old favorite in case the modified version is a bomb.)<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Make it as yummy as possible. You may think this advice is a<br/>\nno-brainer, but not for everyone! When I was a child, my mother hated<br/>\nto shop and cook, and she would really just go through the motions of<br/>\nproviding &quot;healthy&quot; food -- but it was really disgusting and inedible<br/>\nslop -- and then she complained that I just wanted to eat bread and<br/>\ncheese instead of &quot;my healthy vegetables.&quot; I remember once when I said<br/>\nI was hungry, my mom instructed one of my older siblings to open a can<br/>\nof gloppy, stringy cooked spinach and plop it into a bowl for me to<br/>\neat. Of course, I never touched it and would rather have starved. I<br/>\nthought I hated spinach until I grew up and ate it fresh and raw and<br/>\nyummy. It was like a totally different substance. So, it wasn&#39;t that I<br/>\nhated veggies, I just hated the few, gross veggies my mother served.<br/>\nBottom line: kids are pickier eaters because they have a keener sense<br/>\nof smell and taste, so it&#39;s important to offer the freshest, tastiest<br/>\nfruits and veggies either raw or prepared in the most deletable way.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. (Maybe) say something interesting about it. Often it&#39;s nice to<br/>\nsilently set out the new food on a monkey platter, or some other<br/>\nnicely presented way, along with the familiar faves -- that silent<br/>\nstrategy worked well when my son was younger. But if my son (now 10)<br/>\nseems receptive, I offer a light and casual explanation and<br/>\nendorsement of the new food. For instance, I have said, as I set out<br/>\ncut-up carrots, turnips, and ranch dressing:  &quot;Oh, I thought you might<br/>\nlike to try turnips with your carrots today. They are really yummy --<br/>\ngrown by Harve at the Farmer&#39;s Market!&quot; [And, it turned out, he liked<br/>\nthe turnips. But it was not a big deal. He just said, casually: &quot;Yea,<br/>\nthey&#39;re good&quot; and proceeded to eat a big turnip (cutup) and then ask<br/>\nif there was more.]  Or: &quot;I thought you might want to try baby spinach<br/>\non half of your ham and cheese sandwich, since you liked the sweet<br/>\nlettuce we ate last summer.&quot; Sometimes the new<br/>\ningredients/preparations are hits with my son and sometimes they are<br/>\nmisses. Baby spinach leaves on the ham and cheese sandwich? Yes!<br/>\nTomato? Yuck! Other hits have included - ham bits or bacon or peas<br/>\nadded to mac and cheese, mushrooms with veggie-rice stir-fries, kiwi<br/>\nfruit, olives, radishes.  I have to compost/toss a bit of food that is<br/>\nrejected, and I&#39;ve learned to work with small samples so less goes to<br/>\nwaste.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Make it *look* good -- so she can &quot;feast first with her eyes.&quot; I&#39;ve<br/>\nfound that it helps to offer food that looks as delicious as it<br/>\ntastes. A lot of the appeal of candy is the cute and shiny packaging,<br/>\nand the bite-sized (and smaller) pieces. But whole foods can be<br/>\npresented appealingly, too. Here&#39;s a chance to be creative!<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Talk about food in a foodie way when your family eats together. Or<br/>\ndo blind taste tests. Can you detect the different tastes (sweet,<br/>\nsalty, bitter, sour, umami)? How would you describe the smells in a<br/>\ndish/drink? Where did the food come from? What can you tell about<br/>\nwhere it came from by the taste? My son and I figured out several<br/>\nyears ago that he can often tell organic from conventional apples by<br/>\ntaste.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. Respect your child&#39;s temperament and personality. My son tends to<br/>\ngo through phases of liking a few food items at a time, in the same<br/>\nway that he will delve deeply into one or two passionate interests at<br/>\na time. My son--who is resistant to change--likes to learn about his<br/>\nfood preferences gradually, from his safe zone, at a comfortable pace,<br/>\nand I have learned how to respect that his tastes are expanding<br/>\nthrough a slow process of evolution. Another child may want to try a<br/>\nlot of different things all at once. Some people are more or less<br/>\nadventuresome in certain settings/during certain times.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t even touched on different food cultures, although I know a<br/>\nfamily that tries to eat a cuisine from a different country each<br/>\nmonth. In our family, food talk has led us to discussions of ecology,<br/>\nreligion,  government, and on and on. And food can be a key to our<br/>\ninner world, as well. I guess that&#39;s why people keep writing books<br/>\nabout food. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nPatricia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":525087643,"authorName":"Nancy Noe","from":"Nancy Noe &lt;nancy.anne.noe@...&gt;","profile":"yaelleno","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] De-fooding","postDate":"1356106579","msgId":69892,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBTlBqdFU2REQ2ZHpSTzRZVlM4WXEwWEd6SkNHdEVXRHZfRUZZd3Q1Y3k4bzQ1OHZ3d0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNTYxMDQyMjguMjQ4NDguWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE4MjIwMy5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGthdnMyNCtrcWFzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8a2IxcHZvKzdtYmtAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+CTwxMzU2MTA0MjI4LjI0ODQ4LllhaG9vTWFpbE5lb0B3ZWIxODIyMDMubWFpbC5iZjEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69891,"nextInTopic":69893,"prevInTime":69891,"nextInTime":69893,"topicId":69876,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Holy crap, de-fooding?

I have been learning all sorts of newer parenting<br/>\ntechniques lately like hand in hand parenting and ivebeen enjoying learning<br/>\nthem because they are so empowering for the child, helping them be more<br/>\n&quot;them.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut letting a child eat whatever??  I&#39;ve had 4 kids and a medical psych<br/>\nbackground and it is obvious to me that children are not aware that when<br/>\ntheir bodies require protein, they will have low blood sugar.  It will feel<br/>\nlike they &quot;want sweets.&quot; But if they give in to sweets or carbs without<br/>\nprotein, they become sugar burners, which sets their bodies on a path<br/>\ntoward constant carb loading for energy.  They will be hungry carb cravers<br/>\nall day, with tendencies toward obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance,<br/>\nbehavior differences, and cancer.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf instead they are taught the truth as they become old enough to learn it,<br/>\nthat when we are truly hungry, protein, healthy fats ( from healthy<br/>\nanimals, or coconut oil or olive oil, avocados) will satisfy us.  Carbs<br/>\nshould be from vegetables and fruits and eaten after the protein.  And<br/>\nlimited!  Sweets should be mostly good quality chocolate and ice cream and<br/>\nshould be sparing, not every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen the child will be a fat burner for energy.  This is the way toward<br/>\nlong term health, better for their whole lives.  They will be able for<br/>\ntheir lives to eat as much as they want, if they focus on healthy animal<br/>\nproteins and fats.  Every carb is sugar to the body.  Carbs are not<br/>\nenemies, but they need to not be more than 30-40% of their calories.  Why<br/>\nnot teach the children the truth?  And as they get older, allow them<br/>\nleniency so that they can feel the difference between burning sugar and<br/>\nburning fat?  One feels terrible with hunger often and big cravings. The<br/>\nother, if you&#39;re well fed, you might skip a meal sometime. Food then<br/>\nsatisfies.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust wondering what good there is in letting a child who knows nothing<br/>\nabout nutrition lead his body&#39;s composition.  We truly are what we eat.

As he has gotten older he tries a lot more things,  somethings he says no thanks to but he he is open if it smells ok.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: De-fooding","postDate":"1356095219","msgId":69886,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtiMW10aituZHJ0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGtiMDQ1ZCtibXBrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69885,"nextInTopic":69887,"prevInTime":69885,"nextInTime":69887,"topicId":69876,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ************** She s 4 - it s pretty common for kids around that age to become very conservative about what they ll eat.

Make lots of those, with the best ingredients you can - good quality fats in particular (whatever that means to you: butter or lard or coconut oil maybe). Little kids need a lot of fat for their growing bodies and brains and it makes food taste richer and be more filling. Adding things like ground nuts to baked goods is an easy way to provide extra nutrition and flavor in one fell swoop. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":221591978,"authorName":"Bernadette Lynn","from":"Bernadette Lynn &lt;bernadette.lynn@...&gt;","profile":"bwalyalynn","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] De-fooding","postDate":"1356082090","msgId":69885,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBTTZBM04wWWVLU2htT3BINXZZdXJlQVdjeldCTGItcFRBYjBkMXptQ1dGRHo0YVNnQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGthdnMyNCtrcWFzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGthdnMyNCtrcWFzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69884,"nextInTopic":69886,"prevInTime":69884,"nextInTime":69886,"topicId":69876,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ==================================================== It sounds like she enjoys strongly-flavoured things, so maybe try finding her strong-flavoured","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1762228172\">On 20 December 2012 20:22, anita_loomis &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:anita_loomis@...\">anita_loomis@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But I am also feeling a lot of nervousness as I watch my little one choose<br/>\n&gt; lemonheads, blowpops, salted ketchup and just eating salt out of a dish.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>====================================================<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like she enjoys strongly-flavoured things, so maybe try finding<br/>\nher strong-flavoured proteins to try.

She was not being &quot;fooded.&quot;  You are not, yourself, in recovery from fooding or foodation.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBy separating food from other kinds of nurturing and learning and living in partnership, your own clarity,  understanding and progress will be hampered.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone makes up a special term or uses jargon, it creates a barrier between simple  understanding and clear thought.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you look at your role as being your child&#39;s partner, that will be a change from the controls you were accustomed to, but it should apply to more than just what and when and where she eats.  What&#39;s she playing with and how?  Are you giving her choices aout what to wear, when and where to sleep?  Can she sit next to you or not, as she wishes?  Can she opt out of a hairdo you&#39;re wanting to do to her, or ask to do it later?  I think the general question is whether you&#39;re moving toward caring more what she wants and helping her make choices.  You&#39;ll both be learning about each other, about the world, and the more you relax, the more you&#39;ll see the benefits to learning and to your relationship.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not about food.

It feels so much better than the habits I was sliding into as I tried to be a &quot;good&quot; mother and TEACH healthy eating.  But I am also feeling a lot of nervousness as I watch my little one choose lemonheads, blowpops, salted ketchup and just eating salt out of a dish.  She has just about weaned herself so I feel like we&#39;ve lost the back-up nutrition of breastmilk.  I&#39;m also wondering if any of the choices might be related to that lost food.  I&#39;d be interested to hear others&#39; experience around this.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany thanks,<br/>\nAnita Loomis-Yamaguchi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69943,"nextTopicId":69905}}
