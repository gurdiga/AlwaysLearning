Zak went to 7 different pre-schools (one he<br/>\nwent to twice) before I got it that this was not going to work for either me<br/>\nor he.  I remember in one pre-school the teacher telling me that she thought<br/>\nZak was ADD and ought to be on Ritalin so that he would comply better with<br/>\nthe instructions they were being given, because when he got into the &quot;real<br/>\nworld&quot; he was going to have to do as he was told.  You don&#39;t want to hear<br/>\nthe words that came out of my mouth to that one and also Zak came out of<br/>\nthat school that day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother one told me that at 4 he ought to be able to sit down and listen to<br/>\nthe story telling time for 45 mins instead of wanting to go outside and ride<br/>\na bicycle and playing on the swings.  This school wanted him to call her<br/>\nMiss someoneorwother, another thing I don&#39;t like.  I was talking to this<br/>\nwoman and said to her &quot;I know you want the kids to call you Miss ???? but as<br/>\na grownup I&#39;m certainly not going to do that so what&#39;s your name, Debbie,<br/>\nJoan, Alice&quot;  She looked so shocked that I wasn&#39;t going to call her Miss<br/>\n????.  I think he lasted a week at that one.<br/>\n<br/>\nZak told me a few weeks ago when I&#39;d been talking to a friend about<br/>\npre-schools that he thought everyone went to that many to try them out and<br/>\nsee new people all the time.

Perhaps I have not made <br/>\nthat part clear though, we are environmentally concsious and do our best to <br/>\nrecycle, etc. but the environment was not my concern in this argument. Sadly <br/>\nto say, this was only the first in many battles we endured before I had the <br/>\nwits to yank them out of school. I&#39;ll always feel guilty about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109856460,"authorName":"nellebelle","from":"&quot;nellebelle&quot; &lt;nellebelle@...&gt;","profile":"lamaribelle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning]Overheard","postDate":"1048086554","msgId":13022,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNWMwMWMyZWUyOSRlMmUxOTZhMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PGY5LjJiMTI1MmI1LjJiYTlkZGE1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":13021,"nextInTopic":13023,"prevInTime":13021,"nextInTime":13023,"topicId":13021,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Can t you see that they are learning one of life s most important lessons?

Here it is: Spend most of your life doing things you don&#39;t really want to be doing, because you will get paid to do it!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter&#39;s schooled friend (age 9) recently told us that she has agreed to read more books because &quot;she is capable of reading more than she is reading now&quot;.  She also knows that &quot;school is her job&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchools are so full of incentives these days.  The kids around here are wearing necklaces with plastic books.  They earn a plastic book each time they meet certain reading goals.  And it is sad, because most parents think this is a good thing!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\nhoping that nobody thinks I agree with the above!   (except the part about it being sad.  I do agree with that!)<br/>\n  ----- snip----- <br/>\n  Second when did they start using a paycheck and pay <br/>\n  punishment in school?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78134331,"authorName":"genant2@aol.com","from":"genant2@...","profile":"genant04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"[AlwaysLearning]Overheard","postDate":"1048085413","msgId":13021,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY5LjJiMTI1MmI1LjJiYTlkZGE1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":13022,"prevInTime":13020,"nextInTime":13022,"topicId":13021,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I took my sons to a play yesterday and there was a school class sitting behind us.

I just said it sounded like it.  And those children <br/>\ndidn&#39;t sound like they enjoyed it much.  But that maybe we weren&#39;t hearing <br/>\nthe whole story either.
