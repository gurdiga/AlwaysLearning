They had many choices and<br/>\nmaterials (sock, etc.)  I had cut out two full &#39;bodies&#39; from cardboard per<br/>\nsomeone&#39;s suggestion - these were *the* runaway favorites.  This meant I had<br/>\nto cut out about 8 more cardboard bodies during the party....setting things<br/>\nbehind a bit,  which was ok for most of us.    So with the cardboard bodies,<br/>\nthey used felt, pipecleaners,  whatever to create outfits and &#39;looks&#39;.  One<br/>\nboy made his into an adorable clown,  another was fully attired in pipe<br/>\ncleaners...fron curly yellow hair down to blue bell bottoms.<br/>\n    After food and singing,  etc.,  the ones who could stay put on a great<br/>\npuppet show.<br/>\ngracias again,<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4320,"nextTopicId":4341}}
