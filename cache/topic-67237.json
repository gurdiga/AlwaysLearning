My first daughter was diaper free at 20  months, and although there were accidents here and there it was never much of an issue.  With the second daughter, at around 23 months she was well on her way to using the potty every time, and then seemingly overnight she refused to sit on the potty or the toilet.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was turning into battles, and constant accidents were causing me to be stressed out.  So I decided to let it go entirely.  I put her back in diapers.  Paper diapers, because I didn&#39;t have cloth diapers that fit a 2 year old.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen just before she turned 3 years old we went to Chile.  It was summer there so she was outside a lot.  I didn&#39;t put diapers on her and she&#39;d ask me to put one on her when she needed one (this had started a little bit when we were home too.)  And by the end of the 2-week stay she was going potty outside (we were in the countryside) every time she had to go.  When we got back home she told me she needed to pee and I asked her if she wanted to do it in the diaper or in the toilet.  She said the toilet.  And that was pretty much that.  She had a few accidents at the beginning, but none in the past 2 months or so.  And now she even goes to the toilet on her own, without my help.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point being: I let go of the issue entirely for a whole year and then magically, ta-da! she&#39;s potty trained!  No stress, no battles.  (The way I figure, a year of paper diapers is well worth a stress-free year!)  <br/>\n<br/>\nBea</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: son spraying his pants.","postDate":"1337703689","msgId":67262,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpwZ2VlOStoOTkzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEYxMDFBNDQzLTRENUUtNDFFQi04NTY5LTlGREEwRkFBQjMxRUBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":67257,"nextInTopic":67283,"prevInTime":67261,"nextInTime":67263,"topicId":67237,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"==If you re avoiding paper pull-ups, you can get cloth ones easily enough.== I got these:  http://getantsy.com/ Alysia","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-499676727\">==If you&#39;re avoiding paper pull-ups, you can get cloth ones easily enough.==<br/>\n<br/>\nI got these:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://getantsy.com/\">http://getantsy.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAlysia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":231389231,"authorName":"Dawn Sharkey","from":"Dawn Sharkey &lt;sharkeydawn@...&gt;","profile":"sharkeydawn","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: son spraying his pants.","postDate":"1337672223","msgId":67257,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMzc2NzIyMjMuNjg1MTYuWWFob29NYWlsTW9iaWxlQHdlYjEzMjEwMi5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":67256,"nextInTopic":67262,"prevInTime":67256,"nextInTime":67258,"topicId":67237,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We have a similar situation so I will share what we do.

I would like to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-183996862\">I&#39;m having some concerns about my son&#39;s potty learning. He has been spraying<br/>\nhis pants for months, and then empting his bladder in the potty. I would<br/>\nlike to help him get to the toilet in time, but without requiring him to do<br/>\nso. Sometimes he will just go to the toilet if he sees me going, but some<br/>\ndays he is just &quot;too busy.&quot; Here&#39;s his back story:<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHe started waking dry from naps at 16 months, so I started potty learning<br/>\nwith him (letting him run around naked for 10-15 minutes every morning). By<br/>\n19 months, he started taking himself to the toilet consistently. By 21<br/>\nmonths, he was at the 99% rate of success while naked and he night trained.<br/>\nI decided to put him in trainers, and he had a few days of bad accidents.<br/>\nOccasionally he would spray his pants, but he was mostly dry. Flash forward<br/>\na few months, and that awful two year old distraction thing has taken over.<br/>\nHe is just too busy to go to the toilet, so he sprays himself lightly and<br/>\nthen goes to the toilet. Sometimes, when we are outside playing, he will<br/>\nrelieve himself a tiny bit and then just wait until we go inside. I really<br/>\ndon&#39;t want him sitting in wet undies, especially with summer coming! <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThus far my response to him is just to tell him he needs to put all his pee<br/>\nin the potty and to keep his pants dry. I would really like to help him to<br/>\nstop doing this, however. My mom babysits and she is all worried &quot;something<br/>\nis wrong&quot; with him, especially since he had two kidney surgeries when he was<br/>\na baby.   My concern is that it is just going to be a hard habit to break,<br/>\nthe longer he keeps doing it.  I know it is perfectly normal<br/>\ndevelopmentally, but I really don&#39;t want to put him on a schedule with rules<br/>\nlike &quot;you pee before going outside,&quot; but I have no idea what else to do<br/>\nhere. I have no issues with him when we are out in the world,  I just tell<br/>\nhim I need to go pee, and he usually just starts pulling down his pants to<br/>\ngo before I go.  But at home he doesn&#39;t go to the toilet until he sprays<br/>\nhimself, after a few months of being totally dry.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts? <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67240,"nextTopicId":67216}}
