For 8 years, the school refused to meet my daughter&#39;s needs,despite a lawyer, etc.  My son was ridiculed and called stupid by his teacher in front of the class.   My brother&#39;s response was of course that another teacher was the answer.  He truly sounded like a broken record.  Running like a race horse with blinders on.  Not unlike an addict, he was incapable of seeing or visualizing any way but the way he has chosen for himself and his children. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Whatever you believe you can do or dream you can, begin it.<br/>\nBoldness has genius, power, and magic to it.&quot; <br/>\n <br/>\n   Johann Wolfgang von Goethe <br/>\n B: 1749 AD D: 1832 AD   German Dramatist, Novelist, Painter, Poet, Writer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nSent: Monday, June 1, 2009 2:29:43 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] interesting problem with a relative<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-<br/>\n.Unfortunately I had almost the identical conversation with my &quot;well <br/>\neducated&quot; &quot;successful&quot; &quot;quote- happy&quot; brother.

It sounded like projection. It sounded <br/>\nlike he is (perhaps unwittingly) expressing his own fears and resentments - <br/>\nshame about his own failures and difficulties, his resentments at having <br/>\nbeen bullied, his feelings of low self-worth and stupidity about the masses <br/>\nof stuff he has forgotten, maybe guilt at what he has imposed on his <br/>\nfamily - all wrapped up in what might be genuine affection for his sister <br/>\nand nephew.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;you could dismiss<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; them all at once and say, &quot;We&#39;re just going to do this as long as it<br/>\n&gt; works for us.&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Contrary to his belief, it is not her need to hear this, but evidently his <br/>\nneed to express it.

The sister he&#39;s haranguing here is older than he is,  <br/>\nand is the one who took the collect calls from him when he was in jail  <br/>\nand relayed messages to their parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does shed a different light on it.
