I think it was more confiding of me<br/>\nthan necessary and probably not appropriate for me to say about your<br/>\nsituation because maybe it doesn&#39;t apply to you.  And I think it makes me<br/>\nlook weird.  I grew up with a lot of silly stuff that went on and was said.<br/>\nMy post is somewhat a product of the kind of behavior I grew up with and<br/>\nhave &quot;normalized&quot; ... behavior I don&#39;t want in my life.  I feel that knowing<br/>\nmy personal crap is not particularly helpful to anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you noticed that was a father telling his son to listen to him?  Just<br/>\nbecause a story appears in the Bible doesn&#39;t mean every quote in it falls<br/>\nfrom above.  What about the story when Job&#39;s wife tells him to curse God and<br/>\ndie.  That&#39;s not a suggestion to agree to, is it?  Unschooling is not a<br/>\nfamiliar way of life for many people who come into contact with it and since<br/>\nthe Bible is a controversial book even among believers, as a means of<br/>\ndiscourse it can serve to confuse matters more than ever.  I don&#39;t refer to<br/>\nfor unschooling because the Bible was not about unschooling.  Its purpose is<br/>\nsomething else entirely.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso you can respect people and still not be obliged to invite them over or<br/>\ngo see them or call them.  Those things are optional.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order to change, a break with the tradition of family &quot;norms&quot; must occur<br/>\nif some of them aren&#39;t what you want to carry forward into the next<br/>\ngenerations.  Otherwise, it&#39;s easy to end up being all muddy in your head<br/>\nabout yourself, &quot;respecting&quot; the whole lot, and becoming like the very ones<br/>\nwho have given you pain and discomfort so needlessly.  Out of respect.  If a<br/>\nbehavior is wrong or maybe even evil, don&#39;t respect it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the most helpful books to me is The Book of Learning and Forgetting<br/>\nby Frank Smith.  Its basic message is to join groups of people you want to<br/>\nemulate so that you can learn from them the skills you want to have.  If you<br/>\nhave a need to speak in public well... you might join a toastmasters group.<br/>\nIf you want to learn to play guitar, you might find players who will let you<br/>\nin on their jamming sessions.

I had always had what I <br/>\nconsidered a good relationship with her.  Looking back, I realize it <br/>\nwas not good.  She is controlling and very bitter, she has a very <br/>\nskewed ideal of love, especially motherly love. She&#39;s completely <br/>\nconditional in her love for her children.  I kept up my end of <br/>\nthings, without my kids along, for some time, going by alone to help <br/>\nout with things she needed.

If <br/>\nthat isn&#39;t possible and all efforts made, then yes, dump them. It <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t matter whether they have a piece of paper with your <br/>\nsignature on it (marriage cert.) or a piece of paper with their <br/>\nsignature on it (birth cert.).<br/>\n<br/>\n****<br/>\nI&#39;ve broken off with most of my childhood family -- many I&#39;ve just <br/>\nlost touch with, but don&#39;t feel any need to re-connect with, others <br/>\nare just toxic (my Mom and her sisters for example) and I&#39;m happy to <br/>\nbe rid of. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference for me is that I can cut off grandparents with no risk <br/>\nto our lifestyle at home. My parents have no legal right to tell me <br/>\nhow to raise or educate our kids.  An ex-spouse, presumably the other <br/>\nparent to any children involved, has the legal right to insist the <br/>\nkids be sent to school, raised in a particular way and is guaranteed <br/>\nunsupervised access to his/her own children.  That&#39;s quite a big risk <br/>\nto kids&#39; well-being, IMO.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI left my first husband after years of abuse and moved 2,000 miles <br/>\naway -- specifically to cut off my ex from our infant son.  When I <br/>\nwent to court to get legal custody, I knew there was every risk I&#39;d <br/>\nhave to share visitation with my ex, but I needed to establish <br/>\ncustody before I could get a divorce.  Thankfully -- and lucky for <br/>\nus -- my ex had no interest in seeing our son at that time, so I was <br/>\ngranted full custody.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve long believed and said that it would have been better if my <br/>\nparents had divorced sooner, because their marriage was always a <br/>\nmess.  Recently, I&#39;ve come to see that I can&#39;t really know that -- my <br/>\nsibs who were still home wish Mom had waited a few more years to <br/>\nleave, because even tho we all admit our parents should never have <br/>\nmarried, the divorce only made things worse for them.  It was a bad <br/>\nmarriage, but would it have killed her to wait a few more years to <br/>\nleave?  The divorce was much uglier than the marriage had ever been - <br/>\nwe kids heard things about our own parents that we never needed to <br/>\nknow.  Sadly, those tactics have continued on one side, even 25 yrs <br/>\nlater. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know of one divorce where unschooling survives still -- only 2 yrs <br/>\nlater, so who knows -- but that&#39;s something. I know of another family <br/>\nwho had been unschoolers of several years, the divorce was a mess and <br/>\nlast I heard the husband was denouncing unschooling and trying to <br/>\nforce the kids into school, or at least school-at-home.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I&#39;ve observed over the years is that in a divorce things <br/>\nget ugly fast.  Even in a bad marriage, people behave themselves to <br/>\nsome extent - but once all hope is lost, all bets are off.

Baby steps.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother can be discussion to get to the heart of his fears and take  <br/>\nthem seriously.

It has been suggested that we are supposed to<br/>\nstay in a marriage where we are disrespected but are able to drop someone in<br/>\nour personal family of origin without fully trying to make ourselves<br/>\navailable for conversation and boundary setting.  I find this disconcerting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know in my personal life I have parents who are disrespectful to me and my<br/>\nkids and I did have to separate ourselves from that relationship because it<br/>\nis still too damaging to all.  Due to my past, I see this as more I need to<br/>\nheal from and grow from...not avoid completely or sweep that under the rug.<br/>\nIt&#39;s still part of my &#39;baggage&#39; that I don&#39;t want to give to my kids.  This<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean I have to subject them to abuse, either.  No abuse is ok.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also lived through a marriage that was completely one sided (not<br/>\nmine)...I ended up separating and that ended up with me being a widow (his<br/>\npersonal choice).  After a long time of conditioning a small child how to be<br/>\nco-dependent.  I have since then helped that same sweet girl through some of<br/>\nthe trauma and many therapy sessions later ($$$$$) she is a very level<br/>\nheaded young adult about to start life on her own.  Now I have a partner<br/>\nthat respects me and loves me.  This meant that I did a lot of journeying to<br/>\nget here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what my main point is - there needs to be a safe place for our kids<br/>\nto be emotionally and physically healthy.  There also needs to be<br/>\nconversations with the adults in our lives to see if we can&#39;t find a way to<br/>\nhave a more healthy relationship.  If that isn&#39;t possible and all efforts<br/>\nmade, then yes, dump them.  It shouldn&#39;t matter whether they have a piece of<br/>\npaper with your signature on it (marriage cert.) or a piece of paper with<br/>\ntheir signature on it (birth cert.).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust further clarification of another point of view...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nIn peace and love,<br/>\nGinger<br/>\nAnnie(18), Kai(9) and Kade(6)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://twofreeboysplus3.blogspot.com/\">http://twofreeboysplus3.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLOVE has impact.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s not our differences that divide us.

I would tell them why they aren&#39;t seeing us <br/>\nanymore, and I would be absolutely rigid about the conditions under <br/>\nwhich they were to see us again.
