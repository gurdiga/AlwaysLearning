All his close friends go to school and he wants to be *in the mix* of kids, day in and day out, and join clubs, especially drama. He knows he can take any class at the high school and even join any after school activities, but he says he wants *to be there and experience it all*.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also knows he can learn anything faster and delve deeper on his own, as he has done all these years, but that is not the reason for him trying school, to increase his knowledge of a subject. He realizes he *will* learn something just as we learn every day in all that we do, but it is the daily camaraderie that he wants to experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it hard to believe that he can put up with the rules, etc that school brings since he has had choice and has been a freethinker all these years, but sometimes people are willing to put up with the *stuff* to be where they want to be. And you can&#39;t always tell someone what it is like or how bad it will be because we are all unique and one person can be happy when another person is not. They need to find it out on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year I was very sad about him wanting to go to school. This year I trust that he knows what he is doing and I actually feel the school would be very lucky to have such a child in their presence. He is a confident, intelligent young man with a good head on his shoulders. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am looking forward to see how it goes for him . He knows he is able to come home at any time and the school is well aware of that as well. If he does come home, he will re-join a weekly teen group and also wants to pursue internships in the music industry. And perhaps he will continue with any school clubs he has joined. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo I wish he didn&#39;t want to go school and would be happy with his life as it is? Of course I do, but he is not and we have exhausted all possibilities ( that are financially feasible, that is ) and I am here to support him in his new venture. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter,12 , says she will always unschool  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~marcia simonds<br/>\nwww.childinharmony.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":458624268,"authorName":"dola dasgupta-banerji","from":"dola dasgupta-banerji &lt;doladg@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Son asking to try school","postDate":"1281174095","msgId":56729,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGk9R1Y5N1JFeHJSRS1Na0JmN3pmdEJOMlM5NGFKUVc5Kz1lN3FCVEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEMzMjZGMUFFLTE1MzktNEQ2OS1CMDg0LUIxOEE3RTIwQkJCRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGkzYWFoZSs5c2ZqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8RTYyNzVCNzUtOEI3QS00MkJFLUIyMzktNTA0REE1OTI4NzMwQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPgk8QUFOTGtUaW5RenpYPWlpaUwzQUFZUjVqNEFLTFlMQ0syYUEtNmUtRCsxR0NtQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgk8QTlEQzk0N0MtMTc4RC00OTc5LTgzMzAtNjUyNzhENTYyNjc4QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPgk8QUFOTGtUaW12QjVUV2JoT3FGLXRlN0VPZlg4S0VrNW9faEhYd0dpRk5lTW9qQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgk8QzMyNkYxQUUtMTUzOS00RDY5LUIwODQtQjE4QTdFMjBCQkJGQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":56726,"nextInTopic":56731,"prevInTime":56728,"nextInTime":56730,"topicId":56550,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you for such a wonderful and honest reply.

We can either help them pursue those decisions, or stand in their way. I like to think that as unschoolers committed to the ideals of freedom, choice, and learning from experience, we would support our kids if they elected to go to school. I know I would, and I know that most unschooling parents I know who were faced with the same circumstance also supported their kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Fri, 8/6/10, dola dasgupta-banerji &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:doladg@...\">doladg@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: dola dasgupta-banerji &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:doladg@...\">doladg@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Son asking to try school<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Friday, August 6, 2010, 10:33 AM<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what does one do when the child asks for school as the parent in this<br/>\nthread wanted to know?

Although, I didn&#39;t like the idea, I didn&#39;t feel right unschooling her &quot;against her will&quot; as it was.  I felt fairly hypocritical saying she could learn in all these interesting and life-inspiring ways, except for that one in a box that she really wanted.  So she attended 1st grade for 2 1/2 months.  The first month she really enjoyed it, it was novel.  After that it slid downhill in her opinion, but it took her awhile before she was ready to let it go.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is now enthusiastic unschooler, full of ideas and opinions and fun, but there was a transition period even after such a short schooling journey, where she really doubted herself.  I think her schooling experience made her self-conscious in a way she hadn&#39;t experienced yet, and very occasionally still she&#39;ll put herself down (mostly about her looks).  She also got teased often for having dreadlocks and was told once that a girl &quot;wouldn&#39;t be friends with her because she was white&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, even though school brought up several issues we hadn&#39;t yet encountered and are still working through, I&#39;m happy with my decision to let her try it for herself for the sheer reason that now she wants to be where she is, instead of imagining how wonderful it would be to learn inside the box.  This was our experience with it, your son may have a totally different experience if he gives it a try.  It seems that a child who goes to school with full parental support for whatever he/she may choose next is probably better off than a child who doesn&#39;t want to be where they are at.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck with you decision,<br/>\nNikole (mama to 3 daughters (7 yrs, 3 yrs, and 3 mo)) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Son asking to try school","postDate":"1280699206","msgId":56560,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGltSHY9ckdWWVptclcyeHF6U2tmdHgwWlpOeW4tdTZKMThmb0hEREBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDY2OTgzMS40NTEyOC5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwMi5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDg4MDAxNi41OTk5LnFtQHdlYjExMTQxNC5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+CTw2MThBRDcyMS0wNUNELTQ5MzYtOEQ4Ni02N0IyOTFCNTJDMkNAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+CTw2Njk4MzEuNDUxMjgucW1Ad2ViODE1MDIubWFpbC5tdWQueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":56555,"nextInTopic":56614,"prevInTime":56559,"nextInTime":56561,"topicId":56550,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m sure it s quite frowned on.
