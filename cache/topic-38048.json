Yes, I&#39;ve<br/>\nread Gatto and to be honest, all that conspiracy talk just is too much<br/>\nnegativity to have in my life. <br/>\n<br/>\nLydia went to school because most of her close friends go there and I<br/>\nbelieve she really needed to find out for herself what it is like.  I<br/>\nkept her very busy here at home and we had a lot of fun.  But she<br/>\nreally wanted more socially and she thinks that school is the answer. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re 3 weeks in and it&#39;s going ok for her.  She believes me (now)<br/>\nabout all the boring, rote memorization, worthless work they do in<br/>\nschool.  She learned that for herself though.  AND I appreciate that<br/>\nshe even questions... me!<br/>\nShe wasn&#39;t nervous at all about going to school, she was excited and<br/>\nshe has made a lot of friends already.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night we were laying in bed reading and talking and she asked me<br/>\nif I wished she was still at home.  I told her yea, but more<br/>\nimportantly was that I want her to be happy.  And if school makes her<br/>\nhappy than I&#39;m glad she&#39;s trying it.  I then asked her if she wished<br/>\nshe would have started school earlier and she said, &quot;no way, being<br/>\nhome is way better!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool has provided a chance to talk about public school and<br/>\nstandardized test and memorizing and all the things about school that<br/>\nare reasons I decided not to send mine.  I&#39;m sure quite a few people<br/>\nhave gone to public school and are still able to think critically and<br/>\nlook outside the box.  Not everyone there gets brainwashed!  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter has even watched Disney (on a regular basis) and doesn&#39;t<br/>\nown a Hannah Montana or Jonas brothers item at all!  <br/>\n<br/>\nLetting Lydia go has improved our relationship.  She&#39;s learned to<br/>\ntrust me and more importantly she learned that I really trust her (I<br/>\nlet her do something that I wouldn&#39;t chose for her). I think she was<br/>\nquestioning what we were doing here at home, wondering if we were<br/>\nnormal and wondering if she fit in (academically and socially).  She&#39;s<br/>\nfinding out (for herself) that we are a pretty cool family, even if we<br/>\ndo things differently and she&#39;s finding out that she fits in and is<br/>\nable to make friends where ever she goes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope she comes home and back to our unschooling lives.  But I still<br/>\nconsider her an unschooler who has just decided to check out the way<br/>\nthe other half (or 90%) live.  If she does come home, she&#39;ll never<br/>\nhave to question it/herself again!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, no I guess I&#39;m not an unschooler anymore, but Lydia sure has the<br/>\noutlook of a kid who&#39;s been unschooled.

The discussion should be about ideas  <br/>\nnot ... all that thrashing about defending what you&#39;ve done about  <br/>\nschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nReally, it&#39;s lots more useful for people trying to unschool to not  <br/>\npay so much attention to school. I&#39;ve got a school that borders two  <br/>\nsides of my yard. My daughter goes over there for x-country (and went  <br/>\nfor 2 classes last year.)

Really, way way too much scrutiny about  <br/>\nwhat&#39;s behind us. Come up to the front of the bus and talk about  <br/>\nwhere we&#39;re going and better ways to not be tempted to look out the  <br/>\nback window :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; True, true, but our parental obligation IS to protect our children -<br/>\n&gt; until they&#39;re old enough to make, & take the consequences of, their<br/>\n&gt; decisions, preferably without harming anyone or their property ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Children trust we&#39;re keeping them from imminent harm.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren also want the freedom to explore.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can support them by helping them find safe and respectful ways to  <br/>\ndo that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut  &quot;our parental obligation IS to protect our children&quot; is stated  <br/>\ntoo much like a rule. The most controlling parent could say the exact  <br/>\nsame thing as they turn off the TV set and toss out the candy bar.  <br/>\nThat statement is not very useful for helping parents better their  <br/>\nunschooling and relationship with their kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (yes, I&#39;ve learned that I have to qualify everything I<br/>\n&gt; say here - hence why my emails are so long)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, being clear in a few words is better than throwing every word out  <br/>\nand hoping some of them make a point.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Staying home without a choice is no better than going to school<br/>\n&gt; without a choice.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I totally disagree, staying home is almost always a better<br/>\n&gt; &quot;non-choice&quot;  by leaps & bounds<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What does non-choice mean? It&#39;s just hand waving to avoid saying the  <br/>\nparent made the child.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you&#39;re saying it&#39;s better for a parent to make a child stay home  <br/>\nthan allowing a child to choose to try school?<br/>\n<br/>\n From my point of view, it&#39;s only &quot;better&quot; in the eyes of someone who  <br/>\nfears school.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; kids<br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t traumatized by &quot;first-day-at-home&quot; illnesses and panic attacks<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why would a child who is *choosing* to go to school, who can quit  <br/>\nwhenever they want, suffer first day illnesses and panic attacks?  <br/>\nThose are reactions to having no choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child from an unschooling home wanted not to go to school one  <br/>\nday, they&#39;d stay home. No reason to resort to an illness!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I can very easily imagine similar &quot;illnesses&quot; in kids who are  <br/>\nforced to stay home against their will.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; & a home/family is FAR more likely to put the child&#39;s individual<br/>\n&gt; interest(s) & protection first - I can&#39;t believe you&#39;d say that,<br/>\n&gt; really &<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And I can protect my daughter much better if she never goes to a  <br/>\ncamp, never visits a friend, never gets in a car with someone who  <br/>\nisn&#39;t me driving (but I let Sandra drive her and Kat survived despite  <br/>\nSandra&#39;s fears ;-), never walks through the doors of the school.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps unschooling a whole lot more to discuss how we can support  <br/>\nour children&#39;s explorations, even into areas that make us nervous.  <br/>\nTV, non-organic food, sugar, school. Those are all things parents  <br/>\nmight want to protect their kids from. (And there have been  huge  <br/>\nposts full of expert excerpts from fearful parents trying to  <br/>\nenlighten us on our apparent ignorance of all of those.) But we don&#39;t  <br/>\nhelp parents unschool better by supporting their need to hold onto  <br/>\ntheir kids. We help by helping parents look objectively at their  <br/>\nfears, look for ways to deal with the real problems and breathe  <br/>\nthrough the fears.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; what about the parent&#39;s choice, is that a non-issue?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Parent&#39;s choice about what? It&#39;s not the parent&#39;s childhood. It&#39;s the  <br/>\nchild&#39;s. To help our kids grow we help them find ways to explore in  <br/>\nsafe and respectful ways. Sometimes they&#39;ll want to explore things  <br/>\nthat make us uncomfortable, that we&#39;d rather they didn&#39;t. If a parent  <br/>\ncan&#39;t see past their fears, it useful to post here to gain some  <br/>\nclarity. Others can often more readily see what are real problems and  <br/>\nwhat are imagined problems and help find ways to deal with the real  <br/>\nproblems to support the child&#39;s exploration.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to me you have an obligation to educate yourself - and as I&#39;ve always<br/>\n&gt; said - ignorance isn&#39;t bliss - it&#39;s what you don&#39;t know that can  <br/>\n&gt; kill you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To educate myself about school? Just because I don&#39;t read all the  <br/>\nnegative things about school doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m blind to what it is.  <br/>\nBut I *also* trust that my daughter is intelligent and perceptive and  <br/>\ncan see school a whole lot more clearly than the kids who are  <br/>\nrequired to be there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a huge and common mistake people make in relating to others  <br/>\nis in assuming that just because someone isn&#39;t responding with  <br/>\nprotection to a fear that they must be ignorant. It&#39;s *hard* stepping  <br/>\nback and looking at situations objectively. It&#39;s *hard* to set aside  <br/>\nnagging fears and *hard* to trust the contingencies set up for the  <br/>\nmore likely real possibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe summer Kat turned 15, she decided to take a car design camp at a  <br/>\ncollege in Detroit. Carl drove her out from Boston, she spent two  <br/>\nweeks there and flew back home on her own. She&#39;d never been away for  <br/>\nmore than 2 nights to a friend&#39;s house. *Don&#39;t* think that wasn&#39;t  <br/>\nhard for the two of us. But we did what we could to support her  <br/>\n*despite* our fears.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis summer she wanted to visit a girl in Chicago she met through  <br/>\nDeviantart and had been talking to on the phone for 6 months. *Don&#39;t*  <br/>\nthink that wasn&#39;t hard and fearful for us just because we helped her  <br/>\ndo that.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow she wants to go to Poland after Christmas. (You new unschoolers  <br/>\nthink about that next time your child wants to ride beyond the block  <br/>\non their bike. It *doesn&#39;t* get easier! ;-) How many parents would  <br/>\nsay flat out no? But just because we&#39;ve said yes doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s  <br/>\nnot hard and all sorts of fears aren&#39;t popping up. But what do we  <br/>\ngain by saying no? A more peaceful life? If we want a peaceful life,  <br/>\nit&#39;s *way* better not to have kids! What does she gain? A missed  <br/>\nopportunity?

In fact, my 8yo went to school with her 7yo cousin & saw<br/>\nwhat it was like first hand & my 14yo went to school with her 12yo<br/>\ncousin, ditto.  Because of our lifestyle, my children are free to<br/>\nspend several weeks at a time with my family 500 miles away, they vie<br/>\nfor the privilege to go/stay, however they end up there, brought or<br/>\npicked up.  My oldest son was stuck there for 6 weeks+ due to Katrina,<br/>\nbut I didn&#39;t overly worry about him because I trust my & DH&#39;s family<br/>\n(& I could chirp my family via Nextel & communicate).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to my oldest, she&#39;s mostly silent - she wakes up early for church<br/>\nevery Sunday to see her friends & has a very active myspace presence -<br/>\nmost of her family & friends are on there - so she keeps more in touch<br/>\nwith them than ever possible in the past <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t attribute all of her seeming & occasional resentment &<br/>\nbrooding to my so-called &#39;forbidding&#39; public school - that&#39;s her<br/>\npersonality - opposite of mine in many respects - I&#39;m talkative (no<br/>\nkidding, huh) she&#39;s more silent - I&#39;m &quot;happy-go-lucky&quot; as my DH told<br/>\nme, she&#39;s more reserved & solemn & somber & very discreet (totally not<br/>\nfrivolous) - & so forth - she&#39;s been this way since toddlerhood -<br/>\nshe&#39;s always had a lot of personal freedom since she could make<br/>\nchoices - picked out her own clothes (my sisters used to frown on her<br/>\n&quot;hoochie mama&quot; outfits but now she&#39;s totally conservative), went to<br/>\nbed when she fell asleep, time to herself, watched videos/TV, played<br/>\nmostly unlimited on the computer & video games, chooses her own music<br/>\n& loads it on her ipod, is a whiz at pretty much all things computer<br/>\n(from hooking it up to troubleshooting) calls whomever she wants to,<br/>\netc - she has had a jealous nature & has been very mean to her younger<br/>\nsibs in the past, especially her brother 3.5 years younger, & her<br/>\nfirst, first cousin, 2 years younger, whom she&#39;s made cry on several<br/>\noccasions (of course, they love each other very much & her behavior<br/>\nhas improved) but let me put it this way, she has been used as a<br/>\nreason to NOT allow a child &#39;too&#39; much freedom in my family, sad to<br/>\nsay - perhaps, I haven&#39;t been able to relate to her, perhaps, I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t understood her - I&#39;m sorry for that but it isn&#39;t for lack of<br/>\ntrying...&lt;sigh&gt; & I&#39;ve learned from my mistakes - we do have<br/>\ndiscussions at times & I&#39;m relieved that she is very sensible & has<br/>\npretty good critical thinking skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, as toddlers & a little older, they expressed interest mostly when<br/>\nwe were near a school yard with lots of children playing outside &<br/>\nlots of cool outside toys - I would tell them that the children didn&#39;t<br/>\nplay outside all the time - they had to go inside & that a lot of<br/>\nparents had to work so put their children in pre-k or school because<br/>\nthey didn&#39;t know what else to do or didn&#39;t have any nearby family to<br/>\ntake care of their children & that the fun & games pretty much stopped<br/>\nonce they reached a certain age (kindergarten is not really a fair<br/>\nindication of the rest of school) - I told them that you had to get up<br/>\nreally early (haha that&#39;s a big deterrent here) you could only go to<br/>\nthe bathroom at certain times (recess, or asking permission, rarely<br/>\ngranted) you have to eat when you were scheduled to eat, lack of<br/>\nfreedom of movement, etc. (just matters of fact) oh yeah, and that<br/>\nmost kids in school REALLY HATED being there (even if it was because<br/>\nthey missed their favorite soap operas)- longed for eternal recess &<br/>\nsummer vacation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told them the goods things that I could remember - like I could go<br/>\nto the library at school, I enjoyed learning, I was able to be in the<br/>\ntalented & gifted program, great fun, although I mostly saw school as<br/>\nan interruption of my reading - lol, I even enjoyed P.E., walked in<br/>\nthe Prom Court (which was pretty open of my parents - against the<br/>\nprevailing thought of most in our congregation) & represented my<br/>\nschool on TV on a varsity quiz show & at those school competitions<br/>\n(again pretty open of my parents, but, boy, did I feel ignorant<br/>\ncompared to a lot of these kids) Most of the social activities didn&#39;t<br/>\nhappen until about 15 or so (whatever age 10th grade).  So, I didn&#39;t<br/>\npaint a terribly, totally bad picture of school - but it &#39;ain&#39;t&#39; the<br/>\nsame anymore - like the schools I went to are now requiring uniforms!<br/>\n unheard of!  & the even more restrictions & monitoring are unreal...<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we have family & friends who insist on putting their kids in<br/>\nschool no matter what their child wants, even when the mom is a SAHM.<br/>\n My children saw that they couldn&#39;t visit us & their whole lives<br/>\nrevolved around the school&#39;s schedule for the better part of the year<br/>\n(as you may have picked up, I&#39;m from Louisiana, so it has been very<br/>\nprominent in our lives as a reason why their aunts, mostly,(adults w/o<br/>\nfulltime jobs) & cousins can&#39;t visit since it&#39;s a 500 mile trip) well,<br/>\nthe offshoot of these discussions is that they would call schools &quot;kid<br/>\njails&quot; & that was that - pretty much all I told them were my experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I do think you missed my point, or perhaps I left it too<br/>\nvague - the subject line states &quot;Why I call it &quot;the public fool<br/>\nsystem&quot; NOT &quot;Why I don&#39;t put my kids in school&quot; or &quot;My opinion as to<br/>\nthe motive for public schooling&quot; - I call it the public fool system<br/>\nbecause it&#39;s stated intent was to &#39;dumb down&#39; the nation&#39;s children,<br/>\nto make fools of the public as those who pose no threat or challenge<br/>\nto the &#39;establishment.&#39; But, please, don&#39;t believe me, look it up<br/>\nyourself, blame the creators, not the victims or the whistle-blowers,<br/>\nI didn&#39;t write the Communist Manifesto.

I respect everyone on this list<br/>\n& I think I&#39;m safe to say that most of us are unconventional, even<br/>\nvisionary thinkers - even if some have &#39;had&#39; to un-unschool their<br/>\nchildren based on pressure from people or circumstances, the fact that<br/>\nthey&#39;re on this list means that many more people are, at least,<br/>\nexposed to the concept. Of course, some may be here to make judgments<br/>\n& use this list&#39;s attitudes & revelations as a way to formulate<br/>\narguments against unschooling.  I&#39;m not so naive as to believe this is<br/>\nimpossible.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy opinions are not based on some heinous happenings, bad memories<br/>\n(although I was teased for wearing glasses, being a bookworm and my<br/>\nreligious beliefs) or vendetta - in fact I was taught in 3rd grade by<br/>\ngrandmother! - I used to walk to school with her - some of my best<br/>\nmemories ever! - However, she was old-school strict & retired early,<br/>\nregretfully, due to parental interference - although she&#39;d have past<br/>\nstudents come visit her at least once a week, telling the class that<br/>\nshe was their favorite teacher ever!  My uncle is/was a principal (not<br/>\nsure if he&#39;s retired) & there were many educators in my family -<br/>\nAll-in-all, I  had a rather good, successful, school experience - did<br/>\nwell, had a good rep, graduated with honors & was offered a 4-yr<br/>\nscholarship to LSU based on my ACT score.  So, I really have no axe to<br/>\ngrind.  I didn&#39;t know anyone who was home-schooled whilst growing up,<br/>\nbut I did know quite a few people who left as soon as they reached the<br/>\n&#39;legal&#39; age to do so & who had the truant officer tracking them down<br/>\nbefore they reached the appropriate age.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW - I didn&#39;t come up with that appellation, however, I did 13 years<br/>\nin it - so based on personal experience  I thought it a clever<br/>\ncatch-all phrase - remember - almost EVERYBODY from politicians to<br/>\ncriminals (is there a difference?...) came from a public school system<br/>\n- except for those small percentage who got private<br/>\nschooling/tutoring, obviously.  Whatever was &quot;good&quot; about the system<br/>\nis mostly gone & as was pointed out several times by others - it&#39;s<br/>\nmore for social interaction or the so-called &#39;socialization&#39; which<br/>\nDOES NOT mean acquiring more social graces (so parents think) although<br/>\nit definitely teaches A LOT about human nature & competition - it<br/>\nmeans becoming more acclimated to a certain/particular controlled<br/>\nenvironment (&#39;official&#39; definition(s) at the end of the email)  - And<br/>\ndid anyone know that in some states, parents can actually GO TO JAIL<br/>\nif their kids miss too much school - I&#39;m serious!  (Again, I know of<br/>\nsomeone who really experienced this scenario.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it rather interesting & sorta humorous that some are taking<br/>\nissue with my apparent intolerance for public schooling - I&#39;m not the<br/>\nintolerant one - below is the govt&#39;s idea (pretty recent, I might add,<br/>\nand chilling...) please note that it does not mention the 3 R&#39;s,<br/>\ncritical thinking, career skills, etc as the primary purpose, which<br/>\nmakes them, at the highest, secondary, I&#39;m looking for the whole<br/>\ndecision, to see if these aspects are mentioned at all:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://daviddfriedman.blogspot.com/2008/03/purpose-of-public-schooling.html\">http://daviddfriedman.blogspot.com/2008/03/purpose-of-public-schooling.html</a><br/>\nMonday, March 17, 2008<br/>\nThe Purpose of Public Schooling<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;A primary purpose of the educational system is to train school<br/>\nchildren in good citizenship, patriotism and loyalty to the state and<br/>\nthe nation as a means of protecting the public welfare.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJustice H.

Schools are to establish<br/>\nfixed habits of reaction to authority. This, of course, precludes<br/>\ncritical judgment completely. It also pretty much destroys the idea<br/>\nthat useful or interesting material should be taught, because you<br/>\ncan&#39;t test for reflexive obedience until you know whether you can make<br/>\nkids learn, and do, foolish and boring things. <br/>\n     <br/>\n    2) The integrating function. This might well be called &quot;the<br/>\nconformity function,&quot; because its intention is to make children as<br/>\nalike as possible. People who conform are predictable, and this is of<br/>\ngreat use to those who wish to harness and manipulate a large labor<br/>\nforce. <br/>\n     <br/>\n    3) The diagnostic and directive function. School is meant to<br/>\ndetermine each student&#39;s proper social role. This is done by logging<br/>\nevidence mathematically and anecdotally on cumulative records. As in<br/>\n&quot;your permanent record.&quot; Yes, you do have one. <br/>\n <br/>\n    4) The differentiating function. Once their social role has been<br/>\n&quot;diagnosed,&quot; children are to be sorted by role and trained only so far<br/>\nas their destination in the social machine merits - and not one step<br/>\nfurther. So much for making kids their personal best.<br/>\n<br/>\n    5) The selective function. This refers not to human choice at all<br/>\nbut to Darwin&#39;s theory of natural selection as applied to what he<br/>\ncalled &quot;the favored races.&quot; In short, the idea is to help things along<br/>\nby consciously attempting to improve the breeding stock. Schools are<br/>\nmeant to tag the unfit - with poor grades, remedial placement, and<br/>\nother punishments - clearly enough that their peers will accept them<br/>\nas inferior and effectively bar them from the reproductive<br/>\nsweepstakes. That&#39;s what all those little humiliations from first<br/>\ngrade onward were intended to do: wash the dirt down the drain.<br/>\n<br/>\n    6) The propaedeutic function. The societal system implied by these<br/>\nrules will require an elite group of caretakers. To that end, a small<br/>\nfraction of the kids will quietly be taught how to manage this<br/>\ncontinuing project, how to watch over and control a population<br/>\ndeliberately dumbed down and declawed in order that government might<br/>\nproceed unchallenged and corporations might never want for obedient<br/>\nlabor.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there is some hope:<br/>\n<br/>\nFor anyone who may be facing legal challenges - but bear in mind that<br/>\nthese are circa 2003:<br/>\n<br/>\nDecisions of the United States Supreme Court Upholding Parental Rights<br/>\nas &quot;Fundamental&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nby Christopher J.
