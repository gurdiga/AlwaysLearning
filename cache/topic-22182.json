One place to start is their info on getting started <br/>\nhomeschooling, titled &quot;From Chaos to Confidence&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to their conference in Sacramento in August with a group of <br/>\nfriends (from San Jose), and it&#39;s my eighth time attending.  This can be <br/>\nfairly expensive if you go for the whole thing and stay at the hotel, <br/>\nbut less expensive if you are close enough to drop by just for one day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe inimitable Pam Sorooshian is a featured speaker this year.  I <br/>\nguarantee that unschooling parents will find her presentations <br/>\nfascinating and enheartening.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a crude rule of thumb, in California it seems like the bigger the <br/>\ncity the worse the schools and the bigger the homeschooling group.  Some <br/>\nsuburbs and rural areas seem to have a thinner smattering of homeschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**What part of California? There are quite a few unschoolers, and <br/>\nthere&#39;s a state organization (good general info, not specifically <br/>\nunschooling) and a fun conference once a year in Sacramento, and you can <br/>\nstill get to lists like this, even if you&#39;re in California. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hsc.org/_\">http://www.hsc.org/_</a> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hsc.org/)\">http://www.hsc.org/)</a> <br/>\n <br/>\nThey have county contacts, and a magazine.**</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22176,"nextTopicId":22187}}
