Most of us got along and played together (some we<br/>\nliked more than others).  Across the street from us were 2 bullies.  The<br/>\nolder one was worse, but his brother followed in his footsteps.  Most of the<br/>\nbullying was verbal: making fun of people, name calling, etc.  I do remember<br/>\none occasion when the older one was trying to choke my older sister (and I<br/>\nremember whacking him over the head with a hoppity hop ball to make him go<br/>\naway) when we were in our yard.  I don&#39;t remember my parents ever<br/>\nintervening, except maybe with the standard things (ie walk away).<br/>\n<br/>\nOne day I was playing with another girl, when the younger bully came along<br/>\nand started tormenting us.  I don&#39;t remember how, but he got us trapped in<br/>\nour neighbor&#39;s garbage bin (a wooden shed-like thing they stored their metal<br/>\ntrash cans in).  Then we heard the older boy ask the younger one who he had<br/>\nin there.  For some reason he wanted to go after my friend.  He opened the<br/>\ndoor and started choking her.  The only thing I could think of to do was<br/>\npick up a rock and hit him on the head with it.  He ran home crying.<br/>\nApparently his mother called my mother on the phone, because the next thing<br/>\nI knew she was there to bring me home.  And as we walked past the bullies<br/>\nhouse, their mother screamed at my mother to &quot;keep your kid away from my<br/>\nkid!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t remember my mother ever talking to me about any alternatives, about<br/>\nmy feelings, and I remember being grounded for hitting someone with a rock<br/>\n(I was probably 8 or 9).  But at the time, my friend was being hurt, I knew<br/>\nwords wouldn&#39;t work (never had before) and I wasn&#39;t strong enough to push<br/>\nhim off by myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m rambling.  I remember the incidents but not any help from my<br/>\nparents.<br/>\n<br/>\nJanet (the bully&#39;s bully, rambling.........)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4518,"nextTopicId":4527}}
