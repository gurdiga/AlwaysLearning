It&#39;s in mind because I&#39;m about to go to  <br/>\nEngland for the third time in my life.  The first time was in 1979 (I  <br/>\nthink; give or take a year).  I was in a fish&#39;n&#39;chips shop run by  <br/>\nAsians (Chinese I think) and they were watching Dukes of Hazard while  <br/>\nmy fish was frying.  I went to England with Holly in 2000.  There  <br/>\nseemed to be a daily TV broadcast of Little House on the Prairie.   <br/>\nMaybe it was only weekly, and I happened to see it more than once.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn both cases it was like the poster of the Grand Canyon I saw on that  <br/>\nfirst trip, in the window of a tiny travel agency office near the  <br/>\nTwinings Tea shop near Picadilly Circus (which isn&#39;t at all like the  <br/>\ncircus Joyce mentioned in her list).   What is exotic, in a place, is  <br/>\nwhat is unlike that place.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I watch Seven Samurai I like the construction of the pens and  <br/>\nlittle out buildings and the clothing and the people&#39;s glance and  <br/>\nposture (which now reminds me of anime, but didn&#39;t when I first saw  <br/>\nit.  When Keith watches it I know he likes the interpersonal relations  <br/>\nof the men, the class issues, and the fighting.   He&#39;s quite into the  <br/>\nparallels with cowboy movies, and not just the obvious.  Keith likes  <br/>\nSeven Samurai much more than I do, but he&#39;s a martial arts kind of  <br/>\nguy.  I&#39;m a language-thinking person, and that movie isn&#39;t in a  <br/>\nlanguage I understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo back to my seeming lack of point:<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s harder to make a list of things that aren&#39;t related than to make  <br/>\na list of things that are.  There&#39;s a game called &quot;Set&quot; and it&#39;s  <br/>\nfamously easier for children to play than adults (generally; of course  <br/>\nthere are exceptions, and any visual or pattern/mathematical  thinkers  <br/>\nwill do better than people who think in words).  One type of set of  <br/>\nthree in that game is three things that are all equally different.<br/>\n<br/>\nMental gymnastics are good for unschooling parents.  If you can jump  <br/>\nfrom one idea to another, as unrelated as possible, somehow you  <br/>\ncalculated or mapped out what WAS related in a split second so you  <br/>\ncould jump away from the connections you were making.  Then when you  <br/>\njump to a third idea or example, you go away from both of those, and  <br/>\nin the time it takes to make such a list you&#39;ve given your mind an  <br/>\ninteresting workout, and it will leave a little after-trail like the  <br/>\nafterimage you see after waving a sparkler in the dark.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to have the Little House cookbook (created by and for Christian  <br/>\nhomeschoolers, it seemed) but I sold it on ebay.  It rarely fails that  <br/>\nI regret not having things I get rid of. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a puzzle or a goof, if you feel like it, maybe try to think of &quot;a  <br/>\nset&quot; of things that aren&#39;t at all related, either here on the list or  <br/>\nin your head while you&#39;re loading the dishwasher or on paper when  <br/>\nyou&#39;re waiting somewhere or with your kids as a game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a school-at-home curriculum can be based on Little House on the  <br/>\nPrairie, maybe an unschooling &quot;curriculum&quot; needs to involve people  <br/>\nwith a facility for finding much larger patterns and connections (or  <br/>\nlack thereof).<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":291006621,"authorName":"g-liberatedlearning","from":"g-liberatedlearning &lt;liberatedlearning@...&gt;","profile":"liberatedlrning","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Little House in the Big Woods, was Re: Banish scarcity","postDate":"1246537964","msgId":46213,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU3QURGODYyLUQ0RTMtNDc3Ny04RjQ3LTVCRjA5QTlFNTNDMUBnbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDRDMEZGQjBELTE3MjMtNEM4Qi1CM0M4LUFCQkE2QzIwNERFMEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGgyZ245dCtvbW1zQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8OTU2MjVCNDItQTk2RS00Rjc4LUEwMUMtOEQyQTlBN0M2MEM4QGNvbWNhc3QubmV0PiA8NzgwODIyLjY4ODA2LnFtQHdlYjg2MjA3Lm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDRDMEZGQjBELTE3MjMtNEM4Qi1CM0M4LUFCQkE2QzIwNERFMEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":46212,"nextInTopic":46217,"prevInTime":46212,"nextInTime":46214,"topicId":46157,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

For movies, thankfully, there&#39;s  <br/>\nkidsinmind.com and imdb.com&#39;s parental guides which I always check for  <br/>\nher before she&#39;ll agree to watch a movie.  But the only way I can  <br/>\nthink of to preview a book is to read it myself ahead of her.  We read  <br/>\nto her a lot.  She has at least three different books going at any  <br/>\ngiven time -- one being read to her by each of us, her brother, her  <br/>\nfather and myself.

It&#39;s looking at a thing and wondering if there is  <br/>\nlearning and importance in it. It will lead to worry about how to get  <br/>\nit into the child. And what if the child rejects it? How else can  <br/>\nthat &quot;important thing&quot; get into the child?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question that will turn thinking toward unschooling is &quot;Is this  <br/>\nsomething my particular child might enjoy?&quot; Ask it of the Little  <br/>\nHouse books, the circus, South Park, pistachio ice cream,  <br/>\ntrampolines, a garden, grocery shopping, a crossword puzzle ....<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than facing a thing and wondering at its merits and how or  <br/>\nwhether to get it into a child, face the child and wonder how to  <br/>\nnurture and support who the child is and what fascinates them, and  <br/>\nwhat kinds of things that they haven&#39;t experienced yet that they  <br/>\nmight also like.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t remember the Little House series being touted as examples of  <br/>\nfamily role models by homeschoolers, but I don&#39;t doubt it. It was  <br/>\nvery popular among the school at homers, especially the  <br/>\nfundamentalists and I can see the family relationship being a selling  <br/>\npoint for them. But it was also an easy way for curriculum users to  <br/>\nget history into their kids!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for me the merit of trying the series with Kathryn was that it  <br/>\nwas a meatier story than what was normally targeted at 4 yos. (It  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have even occurred to me to try it with her except that  <br/>\nseveral homeschoolers had said their 4 yos liked it.) I think I read  <br/>\nit to her on her 4th birthday and she was fascinated by it. (She also  <br/>\ninexplicably enjoyed Dances with Wolves which was 3 hours long. And  <br/>\nSeven Samurai which is longer in Japanese and black and white and I  <br/>\nread the subtitles to her over 3 days. Not sure what possessed me to  <br/>\ntry that but she enjoyed it!)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut my particular child isn&#39;t sensitive. She doesn&#39;t get that  <br/>\nempathic connection some kids do that would cause them to be  <br/>\ndisturbed by the moments of harshness. (I don&#39;t remember many of  <br/>\nthem, but for a sensitive child they would loom larger.) The  <br/>\nharshness was just part of the story for her. Just as Xena kills  <br/>\nthings with a sword. While they might be role models for characters  <br/>\nshe creates, they aren&#39;t role models for her life. Our real life is  <br/>\nand was her role model. Different lifestyles can certainly be fodder  <br/>\nfor conversation though.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Ma&#39;s negative attitude toward Indians -- for those who haven&#39;t  <br/>\nread the series, Pa&#39;s was different and I believe it was clear Laura  <br/>\nunderstood his view better than her mother&#39;s -- again the question to  <br/>\nask is &quot;Is this something my child would find upsetting?&quot; I don&#39;t  <br/>\nthink we should fear kids seeing other viewpoints. Hate doesn&#39;t come  <br/>\nreading about someone hating someone. And it&#39;s helpful to understand  <br/>\nwhy people hate. It&#39;s helpful to see them as real people with real  <br/>\n(to them) reasons for hating others. People who hate, people who  <br/>\nstrike their kids, people who steal, people who use drugs are not  <br/>\n&quot;other&quot;. They aren&#39;t some other lifeform or people who just decided  <br/>\nthey&#39;ll be bad and do bad things. They have understandable reasons  <br/>\nfor their choices. Understanding doesn&#39;t make them right! (If I&#39;m  <br/>\nremembering right, Ma had understandable reasons for her fear and  <br/>\nhatred.)

I loved the idea of a pioneer life and I still do find it fascinating. My mom made me a bonnet and a dress and we went to Minden, Nebraska&#39;s Pioneer Village where I bought a broom. She&#39;s made a dress for Linnaea that was very similar and Linnaea loved it in her turn. No bonnet, though. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have diaries by women who lived in the Dakotas and Nebraska who often made their living as teachers, although one is about two sisters who homesteaded. Old Jules is one of the best reads I know about that kind of life. These weren&#39;t nice people living nice lives. These were people who needed to move up and out and away and didn&#39;t really like to be near their neighbors. These were also my people. My grandfather crossed Kansas in a covered wagon and his grandfather was shot over water rights and his shooter was lynched. Giants in the Earth is also a really fascinating look at the intense loneliness and the possibilities of homesteading. I don&#39;t recall much child hitting in that book. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think Laura Ingalls is the be all end all to exploring that expansionist history of the U.S. I haven&#39;t read them to Linnaea or Simon.

And they are the halcyon days of yore books, like Swallows and Amazons (which I couldn&#39;t finish), they are about how interesting and engaging a life of nature and exploring can be. And I honestly think that&#39;s why they are the books that get touted by the homeschooling community. They are a life without computers and television and video games and the lives are good and Laura lived to be 90 so it wasn&#39;t all hardship. Maybe that&#39;s why I liked Old Jules and Giants in the Earth so much, the life isn&#39;t being painted with a lot of whitewash to show how scarcity makes for a well lived childhood. It might also be why I found Luc Sante&#39;s books about Hell&#39;s Kitchen in New York and a picture<br/>\n book of death in NYC from the photos of the earliest NYC police photographers so fascinating as well as  Wisconsin Death Trip, which is a collection of newspaper articles about insanity and death in Wisconsin in the late 1800&#39;s. But as a child I loved the Boxcar Children and Anne of Green Gables and Betsy, Tacy and Tibb, I liked the myth of a childhood of hardship being good for the soul. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------<br/>\nI&#39;d like to ask, though, if people here think that I ought to have  <br/>\nbrought the Little House books into our lives?

So we set up<br/>\nthe drawer as an accessible place for the stuff they like best, and we&#39;re<br/>\ntotally up for putting whatever they&#39;re into at the moment there.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That doesn&#39;t surprise me.<br/>\n&gt; What might surprise me is that they wanted sweets.  Maybe after<br/>\n&gt; feeling abundance for a bit they&#39;ll ask for things besides candy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, it surprised me too, and I think Pam might be onto something; they&#39;re<br/>\ntrying it on. But it felt really, really good to just say &quot;oh, OK, you&#39;re<br/>\nfeeling a lack there for whatever reason, and we can address it right now<br/>\nwith no drama, before it becomes A Big Thing (tm)&quot;. They&#39;ve gone through<br/>\nstages of asking for other stuff before; there&#39;s a story about Kestrel<br/>\nturning down sweets in favor of garlic pickles on your site.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~L!<br/>\n<br/>\ns/v Excellent Adventure<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theexcellentadventure.com/\">http://www.theexcellentadventure.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Banish scarcity","postDate":"1246465439","msgId":46163,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRBNEI4RDlGLjQwMzA3MDBAbWFjLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEREMDM4RDQzLTZGRDQtNDZFMC05RTMxLUFDMDQ1QURBRDYzMkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGM2NDM4ODRjMDkwNzAxMDg0NnE2MWE3NTNkN3U5MmRmNDk5YzVhODNiNDc0QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8REQwMzhENDMtNkZENC00NkUwLTlFMzEtQUMwNDVBREFENjMyQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46162,"nextInTopic":46166,"prevInTime":46162,"nextInTime":46164,"topicId":46157,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Off we went. And<br/>\nmany great conversations were had. Amongst these, was a talk about how Rowan<br/>\nwas excited about Halloween because &quot;you can eat as much candy as you want.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, we don&#39;t do restrictions. There are several bags of different types of<br/>\nsweets in their &quot;free range drawer&quot; (the place on the boat where they can go<br/>\nto get their own snacks whenever they want, without having to ask us to get<br/>\nthem.) So I was kinda surprised. I asked &quot;do you feel like you can&#39;t have as<br/>\nmuch as you want whenever?&quot; and he said &quot;Yeah, basically.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHm, says I. Let&#39;s fix that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince we were on our way to the store anyway, we picked up a huge bag of<br/>\nchocolate drops, and a huge bag of jelly bellies. Every flavor he wanted, as<br/>\nmuch as he wanted. It was great fun. And as soon as we left the store, he<br/>\nstarted eating. He experimented with one at a time (for the flavor) and<br/>\nhandfuls at a time (for the sheer joy of doing so). He also had purchased a<br/>\nrootbeer, and was seeing what happened when he mixed whatever flavor with<br/>\nrootbeer.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got back to the boat, and of course Kes wanted some, so we poured the bag<br/>\ninto a big flat bowl, so everyone could pick their own flavors. Kes did the<br/>\nsame one at a time, handful at a time, blah blah blah.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this will come as zero surprise to anyone here... but probably 1/2 of<br/>\nwhat we bought is still sitting in the bowl this morning, untouched, and<br/>\nboth boys feel like they&#39;ve had plenty of jelly beans and are totally<br/>\ncontent. The chocolate is in the bag, untouched. And the feeling of scarcity<br/>\nhas been banished.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love living like this.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~L!<br/>\n<br/>\ns/v Excellent Adventure<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theexcellentadventure.com/\">http://www.theexcellentadventure.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46182,"nextTopicId":46191}}
