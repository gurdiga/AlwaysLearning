If it is an odd percentage vs. an even one you can at least get close very quickly.  Things like this were explained to me as a child by my dad - just a farmer living life ;) - not school.

This is <br/>\nwhy the deschooling process is so important.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s often the parent who needs more of it than the kids.  Kids are, by nature, <br/>\ncurious about the world and find things fascinating.  They tend to regain their <br/>\ncuriosity much quicker than an adult who&#39;s been to school for 12+ yrs and lived <br/>\nin schoolish thought for longer than that.  Right now, to you, that puzzle still <br/>\nfeels like school.  It might not at all feel schoolish to one of your kids who <br/>\nfinds puzzles and numbers interesting to play with.<br/>\n<br/>\nMath is a tool, a way of thinking, a way to categorize the world and define it&#39;s <br/>\nparameters.
