I had hoped for some restoration of the way things were, but now I&#39;ve given up.   So if after a while that banner says &quot;Always Learning&quot; with a subtitle of &quot;Always Learning,&quot; that will be why. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nA month or two ago, I fumbled a moderator setting and now the group is restricted, where it was not before.  It can&#39;t be changed back.  But &quot;restricted&quot; doesn&#39;t mean truly private, because people join every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo read more about the purpose and workings of the group:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/lists/alwayslearning\">http://sandradodd.com/lists/alwayslearning</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone has been banned from the discussion following a warning (to me, that he was trouble elsewhere), and then side mail that bore the warning out.  If you get unsolicited messages from someone using the name Elchanan, I&#39;m sorry.  He might be recruiting and wanting money for something called Vibrant Living Ministries, also called Path of Health.  I really hope members of this group have not been spammed or contacted about it.  Part of the information they&#39;re selling is about &quot;schools and education,&quot; so he could have been fishing for ideas to sell there.  Hard to tell when one must pay to read (and that&#39;s not legal for a yahoogroup).  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone is ever contacted directly in any inappropriate way and wishes to report, the moderators will consider banning the person from the list.  I want to provide a space for unschoolers to discuss unschooling in peace.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":72373,"nextTopicId":72390}}
