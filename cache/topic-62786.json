Let her practice seeing you talk to others, maybe.  And then in a serious way I would say &quot;That&#39;s how people live in the world.  I need to talk to others, and you can&#39;t decide that for me.&quot;    <br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce&#39;s ideas were good.  Give her other things to control, but not you.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could make silly, fun rules for each other as a game, and then say when the game is over.  Or play Simon Says, or follow the leader.  Doing a little more of what a child wants can be a way to satisfy and also extinguish (or at least examine) an odd behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is only halfway parallel (?? so NOT parallel...) but Marty wanted potatoes, wanted French fries, one day, when he was middlin&#39; age, 12 or so, maybe?  (I&#39;ll look it up if I ever need to testify in court about it; I don&#39;t remember numbers but I take notes.)  I kept saying yes, in a while, sorry, soon, can&#39;t right now, sounds good.  Realizing I had put him off too long, I said let&#39;s go get French fries, and just the two of us went.  I said &quot;Let&#39;s see who has the best&quot; so kind of as a game, kind of as a joke, kind of to make up for stalling, we started going to fast food places and getting a small order of fries and going to the next place.  There were seven or eight places we could have gone, but after three or four, he wasn&#39;t hungry for fries anymore.  It was a big adventure and we laughed and didn&#39;t even have to drive over a couple of miles, and it would&#39;ve been easier for me to go when he first asked and get one large order, but there it was.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you play with not talking, not sitting, not looking, not laughing dancing/notdancing (music on and off?) and things like that--making rules for another person, but making it light and fun--it might help.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;Don&#39;t talk to anyone, but me.&quot;","postDate":"1315298055","msgId":62788,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVDMzA1MzZELTEyRjQtNEQzMy1BQ0ZCLUEzMzk4QkEzNDEzQkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGo0NDkzOSt1cWpnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGo0NDkzOSt1cWpnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":62786,"nextInTopic":62789,"prevInTime":62787,"nextInTime":62789,"topicId":62786,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
