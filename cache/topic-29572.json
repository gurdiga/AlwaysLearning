Duh..... But sadly this is what my sister <br/>\ndoes to her kids and it is soo sad. &lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nWow, Anika needed a pediatric Dentist at age 3 because of tooth pain.  She<br/>\nended up having several fillings and two extractions all at once while<br/>\nsedated.  The wonderful anesthesiologist talked to her in the waiting room<br/>\nand let her color and sit on my lap while she gave her the initial dose of<br/>\nmedicine out in the waiting room.  She was allowed to stay with me right up<br/>\nuntil she was ready for the procedure and I carried her to the dentist chair<br/>\nafter she was out.  Making the visit pleasant for her was a big priority to<br/>\navoid anxiety at future visits.  Halleluiah.<br/>\n <br/>\nDuring the follow up visit the Dr. admired how clean her teeth were and<br/>\nstarted to talk to me about letting her brush for herself.  His opinion was<br/>\nkids should be allowed to do it themselves and come to good habits on their<br/>\nown terms.  He was really pleased when I told him she brushed for herself<br/>\nand I didn&#39;t make her.<br/>\n <br/>\nI thought He&#39;d be lecturing me (under the circumstances ) but he told me<br/>\nthat decay is largely genetic and that his own daughter had lots of carries<br/>\nand decay at a young age but that her teeth hardened up as she got older -<br/>\nwhich is also what we experienced.  Mostly, I was floored by how respectful<br/>\nand caring he always is with her.  Turns out he only works with children and<br/>\nspecial needs adults.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWe went and talked to three different dentists before we found him but it<br/>\nwas worth the trouble.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo grateful,<br/>\nKrisula<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":295439124,"authorName":"Julie","from":"&quot;Julie&quot; &lt;wisdom1133@...&gt;","profile":"hammy454","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: reminding the kids to brush their teeth","postDate":"1182890048","msgId":29597,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY1cnQ4MCtiaWFuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDlBRTVGQzUyLTRCREItNDNDMi05RUQzLTBCMURGOUJDRkUyM0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":29572,"nextInTopic":29618,"prevInTime":29596,"nextInTime":29598,"topicId":29572,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... constantly ...

I decided to rethink the everynight thing and see what <br/>\nhappened. My 2 yr old like to climb up on the sink and brush her <br/>\nteeth sometimes 5 times a day and will then go a few days the 4 yr <br/>\nold sometimes wants to brush and sometimes not. She usually ends up <br/>\nbrushing every other day. I now say &quot;do you want to brush teeth?&quot; <br/>\nThe teenager was raised with us always nagging and i have no idea if <br/>\nhe brushes at night but does in the morning to get rid of bad <br/>\nbreath. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy two year old chipped a tooth and at dentist said to lay them on <br/>\nthe ground (almost sit on them if you have to) and brush and floss. <br/>\ni thought how degrading would you like to have your teeth brushed <br/>\nlaying down on the floor?
