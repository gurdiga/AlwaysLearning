There are<br/>\nkids everywhere far from any kind of parent running around everywhere.<br/>\nJust got to light a candle for the boy and family and pray he gets home<br/>\nsoon.   The book we are reading is a biography called &quot;This Land Was<br/>\nMade for You and Me&quot; by Elizabeth Partridge.  The author grew up in a<br/>\nrather &quot;Bohemian&quot; family.  They traveled together in a used limousine<br/>\nthat they painted metallic gold and made into a camper.  In the<br/>\nafterward she wrote,  &quot;.For graduation, Miss Brown decided we&#39;d sing<br/>\n&quot;this Land is Your Land.&quot;  We practiced quietly for several weeks in our<br/>\nclassroom.  A day before the ceremony, we walked two by two down to the<br/>\nauditorium for a dress rehearsal.  Miss Brown wanted us to be perfect.<br/>\nI knew we&#39;d be perfect.  I loved the song and felt good inside as I<br/>\nsang.  &#39;Let your voices fill the auditorium,&#39; Miss Brown said, signaling<br/>\nus to begin.  But her bright smile quickly gave way to a frown as she<br/>\nlistened.  &#39;Keep singing,&#39; she said, and walked in front of us, arms<br/>\ncrossed,.When she got to me, she shook her head.  &#39;No, no,no,&#39; she said.<br/>\n&#39;You&#39;re off key.  Stop singing.  Just mouth the words.&#39;  A burning heat<br/>\nflooded my face.  Stop singing?  My warm, confident feelings crumbled to<br/>\nshame.  I felt angry and hot inside.  But I didn&#39;t say anything.  Not to<br/>\nher, not to anyone.&quot; (page 201 &quot; This Land Was Made for You and Me&quot;)<br/>\nShe wrote this biography to heal from that very experience.  Woody<br/>\nGuthrie was a great writer of books but they are not objective, and this<br/>\nbook is great.

He<br/>\nwas a writer of simple words people could relate to.  He wrote a song<br/>\ndaily sometimes two or more.  You sound like a writer.  Woody Guthrie<br/>\nwas a writer because writing is an action.  If you do it, you are.  You<br/>\nwrite very well.  People can understand you and that is one of the main<br/>\npoints isn&#39;t it?   One aspect of school writing was a 4th grade teacher<br/>\nwho was consider very good, told the kids to write and do it creatively<br/>\nbut make sure words are spelled right.  Editing always comes later.<br/>\nWhen you edit when you write creatively, you are breaking the flow,<br/>\ncensoring the mind, breaking the spirit.  Write from the heart and<br/>\nanything you want to.  Hold back nothing.  Than in a week or two,<br/>\nsometimes more, go back and read it with an objective eye.  The third or<br/>\nfourth time around make sure the words are spelled in similarity with<br/>\nthe dictionary.  I have taken creative writing courses and there are all<br/>\nsorts of ways to connect words together in a flow that feels comfortable<br/>\nto you.

I write poetry because there is no<br/>\nway<br/>\nto not write it.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s not good either, but I can stack the really bad ones up and burn<br/>\nthem and I can keep the ones that don&#39;t make me blush for burning later.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I could blame an unsuspecting English teacher but the truth is I<br/>\ndon&#39;t even remember the names of the teachers I had.

I don&#39;t recall saying that the experience with Mrs. Andersen was the <br/>\nonly thing keeping me from writing.  I said that everytime I think about <br/>\ngetting down to it, I remember what she said.  Of course since I am a normal <br/>\nhuman being with an exceptionally stressful set of circumstances in my life, <br/>\nthere are many other things that go into it as well.

Not realizing that I would be called to task and told I was <br/>\nmaking excuses, I didn&#39;t put my entire life and circumstances into my post so <br/>\nthat everyone would get the whole picture.  Nor do I intend to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd apparently &quot;she&quot; is stopping you from reading science fiction too.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo.  The sick feeling that I got that day is brought to the surface when I <br/>\nthink about science fiction writing, since my story was science fiction.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t feel a compelling desire to read science fiction, and am incapable of <br/>\ndoing so.  I said that every time I think about it, I&#39;m flooded with <br/>\nembarrassment.  Does that affect my decision whether or not to read the <br/>\ngenre?  Well, sure, to a degree.  But so do many other things.  Mrs. <br/>\nAndersen&#39;s unkind words and my reaction to them are not the sum total of my <br/>\nlife experience.  Again, I joined the discussion with a description of my <br/>\nexperience with my 6th grade teacher because it was on topic.

I have enough important things happening in my life that it <br/>\nisn&#39;t more than a small drop in the bucket.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do find myself curious about why, considering the several anecdotes that <br/>\nwere posted in this thread, you decided that I, and only I, was making <br/>\nexcuses for not writing.

Always avoid alliteration.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;2. Prepositions are not words to end sentences with.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;3. Avoid cliches like the plague.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;4. Employ the vernacular.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;5. Eschew ampersands & abbreviations, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;6. Parenthetical remarks (however relevant) are unnecessary.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;7. It is wrong to ever split an infinitive.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;8. Contractions aren&#39;t necessary.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;9. Foreign words and phrases are not apropos.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;10. One should never generalize.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;11. Eliminate quotations. As Ralph Waldo Emerson once said: &quot;I hate<br/>\n&gt;quotations. Tell me what you know.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;12. Comparisons are as bad as cliches.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;13. Don&#39;t be redundant and don&#39;t use more words than necessary because<br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s highly superfluous.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;14. Profanity sucks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;15. Be more or less specific.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;16. Understatement is always best.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;17. Exaggeration is a billion times worse than understatement.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;18. One-word sentences? Eliminate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;19. Analogies in writing are like feathers on a snake.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;20. The passive voice is to be avoided.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;21. Go around the barn at high noon to avoid colloquialisms.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;22. Even if a mixed metaphor sings, it should be derailed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;23. Who needs rhetorical questions?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;24. Sentences without verbs--bad idea.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;25. Avoid run-on sentences they are hard to read.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;26. Don&#39;t use no double negatives.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;27. Verbs has to agree with their subjects.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;28. Avoid commas, that are not necessary.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;29. Place pronouns as close as possible, especially in long<br/>\n&gt;sentences--such as those of ten or more words--to their antecedents.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;30. Use parallel structure when you write and in speaking.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;31. Take the bull in hand and don&#39;t mix metaphors.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;32. Never use a long word when a diminutive one will do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;33. Unless you are quoting other people&#39;s exclamations, kill all<br/>\n&gt;exclamation points!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;34. Proofread carefully to see if you any words out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":69247285,"authorName":"Sharon Rudd","from":"Sharon Rudd &lt;bearspawprint@...&gt;","profile":"bearspawprint","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"SCi-Fi : Interesting essay","postDate":"1026762501","msgId":7877,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwNzE1MTk0ODIxLjQwNTE4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0MzA3Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE0ZS4xMGRhMDM1Ni4yYTY0N2NjOUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":7876,"nextInTopic":7878,"prevInTime":7876,"nextInTime":7878,"topicId":7876,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"OOOOooooo I want to read it!!
