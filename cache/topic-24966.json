That&#39;s good; it makes me want to be  <br/>\n&gt; more thoughtful. I have to try to treat people right the first time  <br/>\n&gt; around.<br/>\n&gt; . . . .<br/>\n&gt; Believing there is no God means the suffering I&#39;ve seen in my family,  <br/>\n&gt; and indeed all the suffering in the world, isn&#39;t caused by an  <br/>\n&gt; omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent force that isn&#39;t bothered to help  <br/>\n&gt; or is just testing us, but rather something we all may be able to  <br/>\n&gt; help others with in the future. No God means the possibility of less  <br/>\n&gt; suffering in the future.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One of the most revealing things I was ever asked by another  <br/>\n&gt; homeschooler was by someone who asked (in an online context, before  <br/>\n&gt; unschooling tended to have its own areas) how, without religion,  <br/>\n&gt; could my kids learn morality.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yikes.  WITH religion, they often don&#39;t &quot;learn morality,&quot; they learn  <br/>\n&gt; rules and fear.  Then if one of them starts to doubt the religion  or  <br/>\n&gt; the God, as a teen, all their rules are shed!  They had no reasons at  <br/>\n&gt; all not to murder and commit fornication and steal and lie except  <br/>\n&gt; their fear of eternal damnation or immediate punishment.  If they  <br/>\n&gt; leave their parents&#39; homes and decide to veer off from those rules  <br/>\n&gt; they often seem to go &quot;down a dark path,&quot; or crazy.  They drink and  <br/>\n&gt; hoot and use language that would make their grandmothers&#39; faint,  <br/>\n&gt; without regard to who&#39;s being inconvenienced or offended.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They haven&#39;t learned morality.  They learned to pretend to be moral.   <br/>\n&gt; They had no morality of their own.  They were wearing it like a &quot;real  <br/>\n&gt; men fear Jesus&quot; t-shirt that they could take off, without fear.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If one of my kids started acting immorally I would know there was  <br/>\n&gt; something seriously wrong with him, in the realm of brain damage.   <br/>\n&gt; They&#39;re considerate and attentive to their friends because that&#39;s how  <br/>\n&gt; they have been treated and expected to act, without threat, without  <br/>\n&gt; punishment, but because it makes simple everyday sense.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If a child goes to bed because he&#39;s sleepy, that&#39;s going to bed  <br/>\n&gt; because it makes sense to go to bed.<br/>\n&gt; If a child goes to bed because it&#39;s 8:00, then when that rule is  <br/>\n&gt; gone, the child is likely to stay up past the time he&#39;s sleepy, just  <br/>\n&gt; because he can.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Who would eat six donuts?

That&#39;s good; it makes me want to be  <br/>\nmore thoughtful. I have to try to treat people right the first time  <br/>\naround.<br/>\n. . . .<br/>\nBelieving there is no God means the suffering I&#39;ve seen in my family,  <br/>\nand indeed all the suffering in the world, isn&#39;t caused by an  <br/>\nomniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent force that isn&#39;t bothered to help  <br/>\nor is just testing us, but rather something we all may be able to  <br/>\nhelp others with in the future. No God means the possibility of less  <br/>\nsuffering in the future.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the most revealing things I was ever asked by another  <br/>\nhomeschooler was by someone who asked (in an online context, before  <br/>\nunschooling tended to have its own areas) how, without religion,  <br/>\ncould my kids learn morality.<br/>\n<br/>\nYikes.  WITH religion, they often don&#39;t &quot;learn morality,&quot; they learn  <br/>\nrules and fear.  Then if one of them starts to doubt the religion  or  <br/>\nthe God, as a teen, all their rules are shed!  They had no reasons at  <br/>\nall not to murder and commit fornication and steal and lie except  <br/>\ntheir fear of eternal damnation or immediate punishment.  If they  <br/>\nleave their parents&#39; homes and decide to veer off from those rules  <br/>\nthey often seem to go &quot;down a dark path,&quot; or crazy.  They drink and  <br/>\nhoot and use language that would make their grandmothers&#39; faint,  <br/>\nwithout regard to who&#39;s being inconvenienced or offended.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey haven&#39;t learned morality.  They learned to pretend to be moral.   <br/>\nThey had no morality of their own.  They were wearing it like a &quot;real  <br/>\nmen fear Jesus&quot; t-shirt that they could take off, without fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf one of my kids started acting immorally I would know there was  <br/>\nsomething seriously wrong with him, in the realm of brain damage.   <br/>\nThey&#39;re considerate and attentive to their friends because that&#39;s how  <br/>\nthey have been treated and expected to act, without threat, without  <br/>\npunishment, but because it makes simple everyday sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child goes to bed because he&#39;s sleepy, that&#39;s going to bed  <br/>\nbecause it makes sense to go to bed.<br/>\nIf a child goes to bed because it&#39;s 8:00, then when that rule is  <br/>\ngone, the child is likely to stay up past the time he&#39;s sleepy, just  <br/>\nbecause he can.<br/>\n<br/>\nWho would eat six donuts?
