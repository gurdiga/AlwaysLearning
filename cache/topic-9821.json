I also went to the thrift<br/>\nstore and purchased them ladles, spoons, forks, spatulas, pie pans... all<br/>\ntheirs for mud pies and mud soup (my dd&#39;s favorite thing to create). I have<br/>\nfamily that is horrified that our once manicured back yard is now half dug<br/>\n(the half under the tree shade!) and that I encourage the water hose to make<br/>\nmud, but my children&#39;s learning comes above a perfect yard, and mud washes<br/>\noff!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, yes, definitely, when we have our couple of rainfalls each year, we are<br/>\noutside playing in it!<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin<br/>\nMuch learning does not teach understanding.<br/>\n- Heraclitus<br/>\n540-480 BC<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, October 11, 2002 12:47 AM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Digest Number 559<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are 22 messages in this issue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Topics in this digest:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;       1.

You&#39;ve inspired me to share our day yesterday.  :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We awoke to the sound of rainfall outside.  A slow, steady, relaxing rain<br/>\nthat makes you want to lounge in bed all day.  My daughter was snuggled up<br/>\nbeside me and smiling sweetly from her dreams.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mady (6) somehow talked her brother Alex (9) into painting her toenails<br/>\n(because he does such a gooooood job) for her.  It was the cutest thing I<br/>\nhad seen in a while........he was kneeling in the floor painting toes, while<br/>\nshe sat in the chair looking like a pampered princess.  I did find out later<br/>\nthat it was actually a business proposition that got Alex interested.  He<br/>\nwas charging her 25 cents per toe/finger and he easily told me that she<br/>\nwould be giving him $5 of her allowance on payday.  :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A while later, I found the kids sitting under the patio cover listening to<br/>\nthe rain fall onto it.  I could see the excitement in their eyes as they<br/>\nasked me, &quot;Hey Mom, can we go play in the mud?&quot;   Now, I am sort of a<br/>\nperfectionist and I don&#39;t like things dirty.  I usually don&#39;t intentionally<br/>\nlet them get covered head to toe in mud, but I decided it is surely to be a<br/>\nlearning experience, right?  (we&#39;ve been completely unschooling for 4-5<br/>\nmonths now and I am still doing my best to deschool myself!)  Needless to<br/>\nsay, they had a blast.  After the gigantic mud pie construction, they<br/>\ndiscovered how fun it was to rub the mud all over each other which of<br/>\ncourse, had to be removed by spraying each other with the water hose.<br/>\nAfter their subsequent showers, wrapped in their fuzziest robes, they had<br/>\nsteaming hot chocolate for afternoon snack.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It wasn&#39;t long before something else fun was started.  Alex got his Hot<br/>\nWheels out and they had crash up derby in the kitchen floor.   They used all<br/>\nthe blocks, Legos, and Lincoln Logs to build towers to crash into.  While<br/>\nAlex was building, Mady got tired of waiting and got out a math workbook and<br/>\ndid a couple of pages.  She had to have me check for accuracy as soon as she<br/>\nwas finished (which of course my baby did wonderfully!) and then hang it on<br/>\nthe fridge for all to see.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Then the fort building started.  I truly guess I have lost the battle for<br/>\nthe living room.  We don&#39;t have a playroom so the kids have taken over my<br/>\ntastefully decorated living area.  They had forts built from one end of the<br/>\nroom to the other.  Alex got out his video camera and started filming a<br/>\nsequel to &quot;War of Wars&quot; which he filmed last week for his Mimi.  For his<br/>\nbirthday last year, she got him almost every GI Joe doll and accessory<br/>\navailable.  She is in the Army Reserve and very military oriented.  He<br/>\nfilmed his dolls (excuse me, It was requested I use the term,<br/>\nsoldiers........) ahem, ....soldiers in the midst of a ferocious battle.  It<br/>\nwas kinda Toy Storyish.  Anyway, they were now doing a sequel with Barbie<br/>\nand her friends with the Soldiers.  Barbie&#39;s house was eventually bombed<br/>\n(you could &#39;hear&#39; the fighter pilots coming) but everyone made it out okay.<br/>\nWhew!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What a wonderful day for us all!  I even had time to do some reading<br/>\nmyself.   We now have to plan Daddy&#39;s birthday party ....it&#39;s tonight....and<br/>\npeople are coming over.......eeek!  I guess the forts will have to be put<br/>\naway for another rainy day.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kimber<br/>\n&gt; Momma to Alex (ds9) and Madalyn (dd6)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 3<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 10 Oct 2002 09:06:55 -0600<br/>\n&gt;    From: Deborah Lewis &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ddzimlew@...\">ddzimlew@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: A nice day<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Thu, 10 Oct 2002 02:40:19 EDT <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dnowens@...\">Dnowens@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Do you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; live<br/>\n&gt; &gt; somewhere up in the Northern Midwest?

Dylan loves the<br/>\n&gt; rain, in the summer when it&#39;s warm, and is always out in it.  She came<br/>\n&gt; over a few weeks ago with her littlest boy and told me... came over TO<br/>\n&gt; tell me, that HER kids don&#39;t play in the rain because they could get sick<br/>\n&gt; and she didn&#39;t think it was fair that Dylan was out there, right across<br/>\n&gt; the street, where her kids could see, playing in the rain.  I said, no<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s not fair that they can&#39;t play in the rain too, and I was amazed<br/>\n&gt; about the illness because he&#39;s ten now and has never gotten sick from it.<br/>\n&gt;  She looked at her little boy and said, sternly, &quot;GO HOME&quot;  and then told<br/>\n&gt; me she didn&#39;t appreciate me saying stuff like that in front of her<br/>\n&gt; kids...   She didn&#39;t seem to think it was a problem that she was in my<br/>\n&gt; yard, in front of my kid telling me WE shouldn&#39;t be outside because HER<br/>\n&gt; kids weren&#39;t allowed in the rain.... well, whatever.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your mud story made me happy.  = )  You want to come and be my neighbor?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Deb L<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 5<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 10 Oct 2002 07:43:07 -0700<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Dawn Falbe&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:astrologerdawn@...\">astrologerdawn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: A nice day<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Deb:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I loved reading about your day with Dylan.  Sometimes I forget it&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt; small things that make the difference.  The discovering of something<br/>\n&gt; simple.  Yesterday I picked up my best friend&#39;s son from school (wow<br/>\n&gt; those places are noises)..  He had a half day and she&#39;s out of town in<br/>\n&gt; Kansas for a week.  My boys couldn&#39;t get over the amount of school buses<br/>\n&gt; in one place!!  Zak and Eliott played together for about 6 hours and had<br/>\n&gt; a great time.  They dug up the back garden and built a moat and a<br/>\n&gt; castle.  It was fascinating to watch them on and off.  Soccer practice<br/>\n&gt; came later, followed by a stop at grandma and grandpas and then DH<br/>\n&gt; decided to take both sons to Peter Piper Pizza.  Needless to say my baby<br/>\n&gt; (Max aged 3) didn&#39;t go to bed till I think 11:30pm.  He was in bed with<br/>\n&gt; me and I think I fell asleep about 11:30pm.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What  a great day was had by all...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dawn<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 6<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 10 Oct 2002 10:16:04 -0600<br/>\n&gt;    From: Deborah Lewis &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ddzimlew@...\">ddzimlew@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: A nice day<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dawn, when Dylan five we had a friend here who&#39;s children were in<br/>\n&gt; Kindergarten and second grade.

The little girl, Morgan, always had a headache,<br/>\n&gt; always had been hit or pushed or otherwise assaulted or offended and the<br/>\n&gt; older boy Jared was being bullied by some mean kid.

(the kids and I are spending the day<br/>\nreorganizing<br/>\n&gt; book shelves :o( boring!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Our neighbor once had the nerve to come over and tell me that it wasn&#39;t<br/>\nfair<br/>\n&gt; that my kids got to play outside during the day. I asked why it mattered<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; her, her kids are in school all day. She told me that every time they are<br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; home on a parent teacher conference day or other holiday from school, they<br/>\n&gt; see my kids running around playing. Since she was at work, her kids had to<br/>\n&gt; stay inside until she got home at 5, and they spent the day calling her at<br/>\n&gt; work asking to play outside. This of course is very disruptive to her work<br/>\n&gt; day and she doesn&#39;t want to have to deal with it. I had suggested that she<br/>\n&gt; let the kids come out to play, I was out with the kids, they would have<br/>\nfun.<br/>\n&gt; She, very meanly, told me, she didn&#39;t want her children getting the idea<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; hsing is fun. :o( She then told me she had gone to great lengths to tell<br/>\nher<br/>\n&gt; kids that Moly and Jack had to do all the same things they did at school,<br/>\nall<br/>\n&gt; the bookwork and tests and that them seeing ours out disputed that idea in<br/>\n&gt; her kids heads. So I told her hsing didn&#39;t have to be that way, my kids<br/>\ndon&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have bookwork or tests, my kids are free to play and be kids. She sent her<br/>\n&gt; kids home too, after hearing me say that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Since then, her children have come over often, asking questions about<br/>\nhsing.<br/>\n&gt; They are very curious about our lives, and how Moly and Jack learn to read<br/>\n&gt; and do things like math and science. (Moly said she wished they would get<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; idea and just play, since she isn&#39;t too fond of feeling like a monkey in<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; zoo.) It is a constant source of wonder when I explain that we don&#39;t<br/>\ndivide<br/>\n&gt; our learning into groups like math, reading, and science. When they see<br/>\nMoly<br/>\n&gt; reading about the human body and playing with her models, I hear things<br/>\nlike<br/>\n&gt; &quot;We don&#39;t get to learn about that until high school.&quot; When they see Jack<br/>\n&gt; reading a book with chapters, the youngest Jack&#39;s age, made a comment that<br/>\n&gt; she didn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; to read *chapter books* until next year. (Jack wanted to<br/>\n&gt; know what a chapter book was.) Many times I have had to sit and explain<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; I have never grouped books into categories like chapter books. They are<br/>\n&gt; amazed that my kids can read and write. By the things they say, I am sure<br/>\n&gt; their mother has gone to great lengths to get them to believe they would<br/>\n&gt; never learn by just being kids. :o(<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~Nancy Who would rather hear all about everyone&#39;s great and not-so-great<br/>\n&gt; unschooling days than any &#39;ole neighbor. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 13<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 10 Oct 2002 17:25:14 -0400<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Aileen Bath&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aileenb@...\">aileenb@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Our Rainy Day/nasty neighbors<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I loved reading this!!

I am glad I&#39;m not the only one  :))<br/>\n&gt; &gt; A couple of weeks ago, we were to have our first meeting of a Nature<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Club that I just organized.  I have just invited about 6-8 other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; homeschooling families to go on nature walks with us once a month (I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; go with my girls every week).  Anyway, on the first day, I woke up<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and it was raining!  Of course, this being San Diego, it wasn&#39;t cold<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or anything.  So I called everyone and told them that we were still<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; going, but I would leave it up to them to go or not.  Every single<br/>\n&gt; &gt; person showed up!  Even people with babies and toddlers.  We went<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for a creek walk, climbed rocks, splashed in the creek and got<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rained on for three hours.  What a blast. I am so grateful to have a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; nice group of unschoolers around.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Jean<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 20<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 10 Oct 2002 23:40:24 -0000<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;avgjean&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:avgjean@...\">avgjean@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Our Rainy Day<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In AlwaysLearning@y..., Deborah Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s a great story!

Also,<br/>\n&gt; it can be hard to find &quot;nature.&quot;  For our Nature Club we mostly will<br/>\n&gt; go to state and county parks in the area.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The way I got it going was this:  I have been toying with the idea<br/>\n&gt; of starting some type of co-op activities that would be friendly for<br/>\n&gt; bringing preschoolers and toddlers along, since most of my friends<br/>\n&gt; have these! I thought of doing an art day, a games day, things liek<br/>\n&gt; that.  I wanted it to be free and not require too much commitment<br/>\n&gt; from people, since I always hate the feeling of waking up and<br/>\n&gt; realizing I commited to some activity that doesn&#39;t sound good that<br/>\n&gt; day!  I asked around and everyone I talked to said it sounded great,<br/>\n&gt; so I armed myself with two books:<br/>\n&gt; Walking San Diego--it maps out easy to difficult walks all over the<br/>\n&gt; county with info about native habitats, etc.<br/>\n&gt; Sharing Nature with Children--an old book by Joseph Cornell that has<br/>\n&gt; simple awareness and appreciation activities for kids.  I will pick<br/>\n&gt; out one or two activities each time, but I just leave it open to the<br/>\n&gt; mood whether we actually do them or not.<br/>\n&gt; Then, each week, my girls and I go check out one or two of the<br/>\n&gt; walks.  When we find one that will work for a group, we invite<br/>\n&gt; everyone by e-mail.<br/>\n&gt; Well, I was hoping to get two or three other families to share our<br/>\n&gt; walks, but already I have eight, and more interested.  Yikes!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jean<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 21<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 10 Oct 2002 19:29:40 -0700 (PDT)<br/>\n&gt;    From: Tami Lewis &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:oldfashionmama@...\">oldfashionmama@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: new<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; hello everyone. i&#39;m tami ,married to michael, mom to sarah-16,ben-9,<br/>\nparker-2 and hannah -1. i homeschool/unschool as well as work for my dh<br/>\nsetting appts for his insurance business. i live in florida but dream of<br/>\nmoving to the country.  i love to read and am into alternative medicine as<br/>\nwell.   tami<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Faith Hill - Exclusive Performances, Videos, & more<br/>\n&gt; faith.yahoo.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 22<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 10 Oct 2002 21:31:46 -0500<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Tami Labig Duquette&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tamilabigduquette@...\">tamilabigduquette@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: new<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi Tami,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am Tami and my mate is Michael too :)<br/>\n&gt; Welcome!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Peace,<br/>\n&gt; Tami<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &#39;Namaste&#39; is an East Indian greeting which means &#39;the light within me bows<br/>\n&gt; to the light within you.&#39; In other words, beyond our achy bones, our tired<br/>\n&gt; feet and our multi-colored real life soap operas, lurks a dimension that<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; more than the body, the persona, the ego and all the &#39;trappings and the<br/>\n&gt; suits of woe&#39; as Hamlet would say---a dimension where there isn&#39;t a &#39;you&#39;<br/>\n&gt; and &#39;me&#39; but rather a synergy that is more than all that, a space for the<br/>\n&gt; eternal to rest within the temporal.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Tami Lewis&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:oldfashionmama@...\">oldfashionmama@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, October 10, 2002 9:29 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [AlwaysLearning] new<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hello everyone. i&#39;m tami ,married to michael, mom to sarah-16,ben-9,<br/>\n&gt; parker-2 and hannah -1. i homeschool/unschool as well as work for my dh<br/>\n&gt; setting appts for his insurance business. i live in florida but dream of<br/>\n&gt; moving to the country.  i love to read and am into alternative medicine as<br/>\n&gt; well.   tami<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Faith Hill - Exclusive Performances, Videos, & more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; faith.yahoo.com<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
