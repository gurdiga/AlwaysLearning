Family Guy&#39;s perverted old man has given me<br/>\nthe opportunity to talk about this subject, with some needed humor, in a<br/>\nvery *real* way without bringing up something icky on an otherwise sunny<br/>\nday.  We&#39;ve now talked honestly about the abuse some family members have<br/>\nsuffered and how we (as OUR family) have taken steps to stop/avoid that<br/>\ncycle. Malcom in the Middle does the same thing for a comparison of how I<br/>\n*could have* parented vs how I *do* parent.<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~diana :)<br/>\nxoxoxoxo<br/>\nhannahbearski.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":198231842,"authorName":"Erica Iwamura","from":"&quot;Erica Iwamura&quot; &lt;hakujin777@...&gt;","profile":"hakujin777","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Holly&#39;s take on the 60&#39;s","postDate":"1190921029","msgId":30852,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY4NDUzMWZjMDcwOTI3MTIyM2w0YTYxOWZiNGsxMTUzNThhZDdmYmM4MTU5QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY1MThhOTM2MDcwOTI3MTIxNHI3MWZhOGU4ZWlhNTBhNDQxNjU5ZWM0YmJiQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZkZ2VybCszaWpyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgkgPERDRTEyMTFGLUUyRTYtNDc1RC04QzBDLTI2NDg1QTdFNDYxMkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JIDw2NTE4YTkzNjA3MDkyNzEwNDZsNzlkZjA0OGZ5YmIyMWZlMGNkMDk3MGJjOEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JIDwxRkUxNTlBQi1FNDRDLTQyMEUtODI4Ri02RkI3QjRCNTMyNzhAc2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+CSA8NjUxOGE5MzYwNzA5MjcxMjE0cjcxZmE4ZThlaWE1MGE0NDE2NTllYzRiYmJAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":30851,"nextInTopic":30854,"prevInTime":30851,"nextInTime":30853,"topicId":30832,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On the Family Guy note.. did you see the Star Wars spoof last weekend?
