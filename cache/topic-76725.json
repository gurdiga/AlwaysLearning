To a degree, she can have whatever she wants. If she expresses an interest in something, or sees something which makes her eyes light up, I find a way to get it or get her access to it. Yes there&#39;s an element of privilege here I know, but I don&#39;t think we&#39;re excessive, and often the answer is that we can put it on her wishlist, or take a photograph so we remember it.<br><br>But, I think when children know that their desires are important and you take their requests seriously - thus they can have what they want wherever possible, the desire for whatever they CAN have minimises.<br><br>What I mean is, children who usually CAN&#39;T get what they want, or have to do a lot of asking before anything is granted, I think ask for more (on the off chance that this might be a yes day), and will take what they can have just because this is a rare occurrence of them being allowed something/anything. So they&#39;ll go to a toy shop and always want something, or several somethings, because there might not be another opportunity. Same as how some people always say yes to cake even if they don&#39;t really fancy it, because it&#39;s available and you take advantage of availability (artificial scarcity).<br><br>Thus, my daughter will often turn down a visit to a toy shop, and can visit them without actually wanting anything. This is actually also true of my two year old but she&#39;s not really old enough for me to feel confident to attribute the reason to abundance! I think she just doesn&#39;t really understand the idea of shops just yet.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if this addresses what you mean by gratitude. She certainly doesn&#39;t always jump over herself with gratitude when people expect it sometimes - for example when someone offers her some sweets or chocolate they seem to expect excitement and gratitude beyond what they&#39;d expect if they offered her a cheese sandwich. They are usually disappointed. In that respect abundance doesn&#39;t create gratitude. It&#39;s just food, isn&#39;t it? I&#39;m sure something similar could apply to other things? If someone gives her a toy she doesn&#39;t want, she probably doesn&#39;t feel particularly excited or grateful and is too young really to feel a social pressure to pretend.  Is this a bad thing?<br><br>~Erica</div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":341538868,"authorName":"Kelly Callahan","from":"Kelly Callahan &lt;ridgelife@...&gt;","profile":"kellycallahancch","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Toys and Gratitude","postDate":"1455109228","msgId":76735,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBSzhRZjU5eERZPVpKVUNQRmUrTDExOUY9UTIxV0VmWmNUcUhBR19DU0ZRMHBBMkNEd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":76733,"nextInTopic":76737,"prevInTime":76734,"nextInTime":76736,"topicId":76725,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Around gift giving/receiving/buying is when we are conditioned to expect gratitude and thanks.
