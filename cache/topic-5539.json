La Jolla stays<br/>\ncloudier than any other stretch of beach, because of the shape of its<br/>\ncoastline; we&#39;ll go there at 1 p.m. in August and it will still be cloudy,<br/>\nwhile up and down the coast is already clear.  If you&#39;re not on the coast,<br/>\nsay, 6 miles or so inland, you&#39;ve got sun anytime from dawn to10 a.m. til<br/>\nsundown nearly every day of the year :-)))<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you like cloudy, try anywhere from Seattle,WA to Corvallis, OR.
