I said one -  she asked how old -  I said 16.  She smiled and said &quot;Oh, that has it&#39;s own set of stressors doesn&#39;t it, having a teen? &quot;   I replied with a smile and happiness in my voice &quot;Not at all.  He is a joy.  A very wonderful person.&quot;  It kind of threw her off for a moment because I did not answer affirmative about the trials and tribulations of a teen.  I know she ment it as a conversational piece but I&#39;ve made it my mission that every time someone mentions stress due to teens I respond with what a joy our son is and how wonderful a person he is - which is true!  Even if we were just having a bad moment &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is connected to chores in that becasue we do not have set chores and make him do &quot;X,Y,Z&quot; he is a joy - a wonderful person.  That&#39;s not the only reason of course but it does change the dynamics of the relationship.  If I chose to insist on chores then that would add stress to the relationship.  Instead at age 16 we can ask him if he would please do &quot;X,Y,Z&quot; and he usually does it with a &quot;sure!&quot; For example if it&#39;s trash night and we ask if he will help by gathering the upstairs trash while I clean out the fridge, and dad gather&#39;s recycles - and he jumps up and does it.  &quot;Zac, would you please gather up your scattered dishes so I can wash them - and he does it.&quot;  And he is getting better about not leaving them laying around - becasue I&#39;ve asked nicely if he could please remember to take them to the kitchen as he goes about his day so I can keep them washed.  I too gather them up as I move around the house - it&#39;s not all on him.  When I get up in the morning, if he left stuff on the desk by the computer, I just haul it all to the kitchen - with a smile to myself - thinking well he must have had a midnight snack last night - no different than I would do for my husband of 26 years - or he would do for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Chores and Choices","postDate":"1279346048","msgId":56113,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZGMkJENkE4LUE3MTgtNEIxNi1CNDI4LTI0OUFFNTlFNDQ2QUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":56115,"prevInTime":56112,"nextInTime":56114,"topicId":56113,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I know one of these people but not both and I m not trying to pick on a person, but just to bring a real-life example.

The first one,  <br/>\nI know, reads a lot about unschooling and leans heavily that way.    <br/>\nThe other I would say I know know nothing about, but...

And then  <br/>\nshe made dinner. Somehow I think I got the better end of this deal. :) &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the responses was:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Oh how I envy you. My 15 year old has to be told to unload the  <br/>\ndishwasher everyday. She has had this job for 6 years now.

I brought it here, to get it out of my  <br/>\nsystem.  Hope you don&#39;t mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone is down in a hole, the view of the sky is very small.
