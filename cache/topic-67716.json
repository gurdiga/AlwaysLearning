Some parents may continue to love an offspring who understood they were killing people in order to make money but others would see that as the breaking point.

When they deliberately make a choice that harms what you feel must not be harmed when they had the ability to make not-harmful choices then they&#39;ve met the conditions when unconditional love doesn&#39;t apply.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen kids are young, their understanding of the consequences of their actions, their ability to grasp how to make better choices work, is still developing. If they&#39;re making poor choices, it&#39;s not because they&#39;ve adopted ethics that are counter to the parents.

I don&#39;t think that my owing my children respect as and individual is conditional upon them doing anything. Maybe it is a condition I set for *my self* when I *chose* to have children. But in truth I didn&#39;t think about any such things before I had children, or for a while after. I came in to parenting thinking that children needed to be bent to adult will, and that praise and punishment were how this was to be done.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo despite now thinking that I created a sort of contract for my self when i chose to have children, one in which I decided that I owed my children unconditional love. I actually got pregnant with every intention of being completely conditional.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I try to be unconditional and think others should too...hypocrisy? Maybe.

All of this is making the discussion really challenging for me. Unconditional love is a concept I thought I had some thoughts about.

The condition exists, as a response, a feeling in you that is positive. If the feeling became bad, you would change your behaviour right?

Maybe because my children are young, the oldest is only just verbal, so I am only just getting to know him, as in the him in his head that has abstract thoughts, rather than the baby him that is full of instant needs. Maybe as he (and then his sister) grows I will know them in a way i have never known anyone before and I will better understand this line of thought. Maybe others are more confident in their knowledge of other people. I guess I always feel people might be thinking  something and not revealing it. My mother often asks questions that I dare not answer, because I can tell she has got the whole conversation mapped out in her head, but I don&#39;t have a copy of that script.

I don&#39;t owe my kids love or kindness or care. I know that, because I&#39;ve seen plenty of parents who are careless or unkind, or parent to meet their own needs - and all of them say they love their children. I choose to be kind and thoughtful and gracious to my kids and partner... but I&#39;m not sure I choose to do that out of love. It depends on how one defines the word. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a massive disconnect between what most people mean by &quot;love&quot; as a feeling and &quot;loving&quot; behavior, which leaves this topic rather bitter for me. I don&#39;t see parents loving unconditionally, for the most part. I do see that some people make the amazing and sometimes challenging decision to act kindly and thoughtfully and graciously, to be mindful and joyful and sweet, some of them parents toward their children. Maybe that&#39;s one definition of love - if so, it&#39;s the only one which interests me, because it&#39;s so rare and precious. I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s unconditional, though - to an extent, it&#39;s based in a kind of self interest. When I&#39;m mindful and joyful and sweet, my life is better, right then And other people are much more likely to be sweet to me. But that&#39;s a condition, at least in the behavioristic sense. I&#39;m &quot;loving&quot; (if that&#39;s love) because it makes me happy, it&#39;s self-rewarding behavior. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Even if you love someone unconditionally, as an adult, they might walk away.

I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1014901864\">Hello all.  This is my first time posting as I am still new to the group and to unschooling.  I am not new to thinking about and loving unconditionally.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that you can love unconditionally someone you have issues with, and/or issues with their behavior more specifically.  We have had this tested in the past in a huge way when our son decided to go through life breaking laws, acting disrespectfully towards the family, being hateful in word and deed to just about anyone who came into his path.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDuring these years we continued to love him, to be respectful towards him, to stand along side of, go to court with him, visit him in jail, sort through his thoughts, ideas, grief, anger...  It was not pleasant, easy, desirous at times.  We love him, so we were able to continue to be unconditional with that love - even when we did not like him, his behaviors, choices, actions, reactions.  We set boundaries that we knew were healthy for our family, including him.  He did not always agree, and when he made choices in our home, or in life that came back into the home that were dangerous, scary, hurtful... we asked him to leave.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe accused us of not loving him at times because we did not give into what he demanded.  Now that we are through that season in life, he can speak to knowing that we did truly love him enough to not allow that which was unhealthy/dangerous to be part of any of our lives.  We supported him, not his ill behavior.  We did open our doors up to visits, and then for his return into the home when he was willing to abide by the boundaries in place.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur love for him was not always &quot;touchy feely&quot; type of love.  Sometimes it was &quot;by the grit of our teeth&quot;, or that of a protective Momma bear protecting a cub (even if said cub was making poor choices).  We wanted him to live, to be part of life in a way that was not hurting himself or others.  We opened our doors and fed his friends, even when we knew that the friendship was not good for any of them.  We loved him, loved them (even though we did not know them - we loved them because they were someone&#39;s son/daughter, because they as human beings have worth, and individually they all had their &quot;story&quot; that had led up to where they were at that moment.)  They knew, or soon learned, of the &quot;rules of the house&quot; that were in place for everyone&#39;s protection.  Most willingly left their worst attitudes/behaviors outside.  They were treated with respect, even when they were not being respectful to themselves or others(outside our home).  If that lack of respect rippled out onto the rest of the people in our home, it was time to leave - with the knowledge that they were welcomed back later IF they chose to abide by the expectations we had.  Even though we did not all agree on the why&#39;s of things, we could agree to disagree at least for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did not set rules and regulations just to have a set in place.  We made and revised as needed to provide a safe haven for our family and friends.  We did not always react or respond lovingly and when that happened, we apologized.  Stress levels ran very high for the better part of 3 years, and try as we might, we sometimes failed in reigning in our own emotions.  The neat thing about our failures though, ended up with our son (and on occasion, a friend or two) being able to recognize that we too are human, we err, and we can still be loved - even when acting unlovable.  It was a learning opportunity in his life regarding that very same unconditional love.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur son is now a husband (first anniversary today), father to a sweet little boy, and experiencing a different level of unconditional love that he didn&#39;t understand before becoming a father/husband himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the same for Mothers/Fathers/Siblings... we did not choose them, and might not other wise spend time with them, but we can love them, even if we need to put miles in between us for some semblance of a continued relationship.  I know that even when I am at total odds with my Mom - in many areas of life, there is a connective love that continues to bind our hearts together.  The older I get, the easier it is to let go of real or perceived hurts and just love.  Part of all of that is getting over my own belief that &quot;I am right&quot; when we all know that we all are layers of experiences and &quot;teachings&quot; that are often faulty at best.

The closet thing to unconditional love I<br/>\nhave is from me, as a parent, to my child.  I do not really see true<br/>\nunconditional love anywhere else.<br/>\n<br/>\nA pet does not give you unconditional love (which many say they do) as they<br/>\nlove the person that feeds them and pets them the most.<br/>\n<br/>\nA child does not give unconditional love to a parent, I have disowned my<br/>\nbiological father because of the bad choices he made.  I may not have seen<br/>\nthose choices till I was older, but I certainly do not have unconditional<br/>\nlove for him.  If a parent provides a loving, safe home, then love flows<br/>\nfrom child to parent, but if the home is not safe, then one day the child<br/>\nmay resent that.  So a child&#39;s love is conditional on the type of<br/>\nenvironment the parent provides.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame goes for siblings or other relatives, they certainly could do things<br/>\nbad enough to turn me away if they so chose.<br/>\n<br/>\nA husband-wife relationship isn&#39;t about unconditional love either.  My love<br/>\nfor my husband is based on the mutual respect and trust we have for each<br/>\nother.  If we lost that, the love would be gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as far as my love for my child, there is nothing I can imagine my child<br/>\ndoing (drugs, murder, hard time in jail) that I would turn my back<br/>\ncompletely on him.  If things got bad enough, the love may fade, and worry<br/>\nmay take over, but I feel like there will always be a seed of love for my<br/>\nson no matter what.  I am not sure that I would even call that<br/>\nunconditional love though, but I suppose it&#39;s the closest thing to it.  I<br/>\nwill say, though, that this is not every parent, I know many parents that<br/>\nbase their love on many conditions, like my own biological father, which is<br/>\nwhy I no longer speak to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nRachel<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: unconditional love","postDate":"1340214379","msgId":67736,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQzNzZCNTM1LTY4OTktNEQzMS05MkU5LUI1NEVFMTA3MTRFMkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNDAxOTg3NzUuMzA4NjYuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEzMjEwNi5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDEzNDAxOTg3NzUuMzA4NjYuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEzMjEwNi5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":67735,"nextInTopic":67737,"prevInTime":67735,"nextInTime":67737,"topicId":67716,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-You can t conjour love up.

The laws of the marketplace - supply and demand, tit for tat - have assumed the status of universal and absolute principles, as though everything in our lives, including what we do with our children, is analogous to buying a car or renting an apartment.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there should be no difference in unconditional love for a younger and older child, or even when they are adults. They should not at any point have to &#39;earn&#39; love. This book really clarified for me those behaviours I should work at avoiding with my children and why, as the parenting I had was very conditional, something I was aware of from a very young age.(and it has done me no favours).

I have a couple of thoughts on this based on the difference between my parents and how they have interacted with me and my siblings over the years. First,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-87394669\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Advice given to love one&#39;s child unconditionally seems great for very young children, and for seven and eight year olds, I guess. At some point, though, when the children become less and less a part of a dyad with the mother (which is much earlier than seven or eight in some families), it doesn&#39;t seem as appropriate to me.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have a couple of thoughts on this based on the difference between my parents and how they have interacted with me and my siblings over the years. First, I wonder what you mean by unconditional love because my thoughts are that unconditional love is always appropriate. My definition of unconditional love is a love that is based on honesty whereby two people can be completely honest with each other without fear of retribution. With my dad, I feel like I can tell him anything. When he talks to me, he tends to be pretty honest. When talking with mom, I have to be very careful about what I say because I know that she tends to take things personally and make them all about her. I cannot have interactions with her that are open and honest. Even as an adult, there is an underlying fear that she is going to withdraw her love for some kind of unknown reason. In my opinion, unconditional love is not synonymous with anything goes. I think unconditional love means that the relationship is based on honesty without spite and retribution. Unconditional love is about being able to consider the needs of both parties involved without making it too personal. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was in college and was going on interviews and doing other stuff that required a certain mode of dress, I would try on different outfits and ask my dad for his opinion. I knew I would get an honest opinion from my dad. He would tell me if something looked like crap. My mom would not. My mom wouldn’t give honest feedback about anything because she made everything about her. Her ability to give honest feedback was hampered by HER inability to be honest. It was hampered by HER needs and what was convenient for her. She was unable to separate herself and her likes and dislikes to give me an honest assessment. As a result, it seemed like everything had some kind of condition or underlying motive that was impossible to guess. As I am think about this, the conditions are not about the kids but are instead about the parent and his/her needs. My dad on the other hand would be straight up and tell me, “That looks like crap.” If I did something stupid, he would let me know but letting me know did not involve being punished or berated or belittled. The more I think about it, I think unconditional love is love that gives another person the room to be fully human without being berated, belittled, or punished. Even if my child murdered someone or burned down a house, I would not stop loving them. My actions toward that child might change but the underlying feelings of love would not. The love might be overshadowed by other thoughts and feelings but it would not diminish the underlying love. There would more than likely be conflicting feelings. One of the definitions of love is “to have a strong attachment to”. No matter what anybody does, I will still love them. I will still have that internal attachment. Having an attachment to somebody does not mean that I will become a door mat nor does it mean “anything goes”. I have a sister that I no longer talk to or have a relationship with. I still love her but my love for her is limited to a feeling of concern that I have for her. I won’t talk to her or have anything to do with her but I do not wish ill on her and I like hearing that she is doing okay. No matter what she does, we will always have a connection by virtue of the fact that we are sisters. How I choose to act on those feelings of love is up to me. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;But &quot;love&quot; that&#39;s based on nothing with NO expectations seems worthless. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think that one would need to untangle the feelings of love from the actions of love. I can feel love without any reason. Some questions that came up for me when thinking about this are:<br/>\nHow does one prioritize love of self versus love of others? <br/>\nCan a person have expectations with or without love? Does love mean dropping ALL expectations? As I think about these questions, I am thinking that a person can have expectations about how they want to live in the world without thinking about “love”. For example, I do not need to love somebody in order to want them to treat me a certain way. I expect to be able to go out into the world and have people have a certain level of respect/regard for my space. I expect to be able to go to the store without having random strangers walk up and hug me or hit me or invade my space. Those expectations have nothing to do with love. I can have compassion and understanding for another human being without feelings of love. For me, expectations exist with or without love. Love does not change the fact that I am not okay with murder or other behaviors that I think are “bad” or unacceptable. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was trying to make sense out of this and did some research because I had a faint memory of learning about the different types of love in one of my philosophy courses. <br/>\n<br/>\nI found this link about Theories of Love on about.com: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://psychology.about.com/od/loveandattraction/a/theoriesoflove.htm\">http://psychology.about.com/od/loveandattraction/a/theoriesoflove.htm</a>  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a link from Wikipedia about C.S. Lewis’s book The Four Loves: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Four_Loves\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Four_Loves</a> I haven’t read the book but it gets closer to what I remember about the different types of love. I am not enamored with the Christian focus in the discussion of agape but I think it gets closer to what is meant by unconditional love and how I interpret it. It says, “Charity (agapē, ἀγάπη) is the love that brings forth caring regardless of the circumstance.”<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried to do some searches on love and philosophy because it seems that philosophical discussions of love are the most robust and present the most options. Most of the stuff that I came up with was really long and convoluted. Since unconditional love is typically described as agape, I did a search on that and came up with this Wikipedia article: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agape\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agape</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nThe quote from it that captures my thinking is this: “ Thomas Jay Oord has defined agape as &quot;an intentional response to promote well-being when responding to that which has generated ill-being.&quot;[3] “ Based on this definition, that would mean that even if I came home and found that my child had burned down the house, then I would still try to promote his or her well-being. What “promoting his/her well-being” looks like will be very different depending on the situation. However, promoting somebody else’s well-being should not override my own well-being. A lot of times, love gets tangled up because of  self love versus love for others. Some parents get so caught up in self that they are incapable of unconditional love, which is NOT the same as anything goes. I think some people get caught up in self because of living a life full of unmet needs. One of the things that was brought up in some of the philosophical discussions was reciprocity. In my opinion, unconditional love is reciprocal. However, that reciprocity is not born out of expectations or “have to”. The reciprocity is born out of the fact that it benefits both the person that is loved as well as the person that is doing the loving. With my mom, I feel like she is the one that gets the most benefit out her love for her children. With my dad, everyone benefits. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":231389231,"authorName":"Dawn Sharkey","from":"Dawn Sharkey &lt;sharkeydawn@...&gt;","profile":"sharkeydawn","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: unconditional love","postDate":"1340198775","msgId":67729,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNDAxOTg3NzUuMzA4NjYuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEzMjEwNi5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":67726,"nextInTopic":67731,"prevInTime":67728,"nextInTime":67730,"topicId":67716,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The first time I ever really thought about the term unconditional love is when I read Alfie Kohn s book Unconditional Parenting when my eldest was a babe","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-468027141\">The first time I ever really thought about the term &quot;unconditional love&quot; is when I read Alfie Kohn&#39;s book &quot;Unconditional Parenting&quot; when my eldest was a babe in arms (he&#39;s now two and a half) and before I discovered Unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe term was familiar in that I&#39;d heard it a lot, but I&#39;d never sat to think what it might mean, or look or feel like.<br/>\n<br/>\nKohn&#39;s premise is that all children need to experience unconditional love in order to thrive and become happy, intrinsically motivated adults. When adults punish children for certain behaviours (in particular by using time out), or sytematically praise them for other behaviours, children feel that a parents approval, and thus love, is conditional upon their behaving in a certain manner.<br/>\n<br/>\nKhon argues that we should see the positive aspects in behaviours that traditional parenting would condem, and that parents should alter our environment, activities and expectations to accommodate or avoid other behaviours that are dangerous or hurtful.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe isn&#39;t very specific about how to do this.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first found out about Radical Unschooling and started reading the Always Unschooled list (some time before I joined this one) I felt that the parenting described here is how to do Unconditional Parenting in practice.<br/>\n<br/>\n(From following this list for a little while I hear that there is no love lost between Kohn and the Homeschooling and Unschooling communities...perhaps he feels his ideas will have the broadest affect by targeting them at the school system...or perhaps he has an unconditional love of money?)<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with Sandra&#39;s example of coming home to find your child has committed some horrific act, and finding it hard to love the child, or maybe not even wanting to.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is very unlikely to happen, thank fully.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore likely is that a parent will use frequent withdrawal of love to modify a child&#39;s behaviour. I have seen a 4yo put in time out by a parent for refusing to have a drink when asked to by a grandparent. If you believe Kohn&#39;s idea&#39;s about how children experience love, the message there is &quot;We will only love you when you do as you are told, regardless of your bodily needs&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat seems a very odd condition for love to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think Husbands, friends etc warrant unconditional love. We form contracts with them, with clauses that are variously verbal or written, formal, informal or tacit. These are the conditions of our love. Sometimes we don&#39;t get the conditions all ironed out at the right rate, and this is a problem. Other times people decide to forfeit the love because breaking the contract, breaching it&#39;s conditions, looks better at that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut a child does not enter any kind of contract. They can even love when the most basic, humane conditions are not provided for, such as when abused.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you have brought someone in to the world, or chosen to parent them, parents owe it to that individual to respect them for who they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nLove, should it be there, should not be contingent upon their meeting particular standards.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can&#39;t conjour love up. It is or it isn&#39;t and should not be used as a bargaining chip.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen there is no love for a child (or person) because they have done you great harm, conditions become irrelevant.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you love a child as they are, and not some imagined them, conditions become irrelevant.<br/>\nConditions become important when you love the child in your head, not the child before you. Then your love is a catalyst to change them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128961575,"authorName":"Vicki Dennis","from":"Vicki Dennis &lt;vicki@...&gt;","profile":"vickitexan2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] unconditional love","postDate":"1340194876","msgId":67723,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBTVN1N055SlRWS3R4VG5aMnZnLXpFeWVwa0c3dlE9WU5GcVZ4TFBRQk81WEJhcjVWQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDE4MjQzRjExLTQwM0MtNEQ4Qy04QzM5LTRGNTgwNUEwMTBGQkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDFBQjQ3MjlFLUM5MzEtNEQ1Qi1BQUUwLTVFN0VFREI1RTM3OUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JPENBTVN1N056dmVjLUhpREFoaTNCQWpVMGVZOFBETzZVSkdZeURCMS02TFJtekNwTVlwZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JPDE4MjQzRjExLTQwM0MtNEQ4Qy04QzM5LTRGNTgwNUEwMTBGQkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":67718,"nextInTopic":67726,"prevInTime":67722,"nextInTime":67724,"topicId":67716,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It could have been the 1970&#39;s.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a pushback idea in those days that became kind of a movement:  &quot;tough love&quot; <br/>\nit was, partially, a treatment method for parents to use with juvenile delinquents.  But I don&#39;t want to talk about &quot;tough love.&quot;  I want more thoughts and feedback about &quot;unconditional love.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Love&quot; is a problem in English anyway, because it has a large range of meaning and emotion.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdvice given to love one&#39;s child unconditionally seems great for very young children, and for seven and eight year olds, I guess.  At some point, though, when the children become less and less a part of a dyad with the mother (which is much earlier than seven or eight in some families), it doesn&#39;t seem as appropriate to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs advice to parents of eleven, twelve, thirteen year olds--advice given by schools that need kids to be placated and encouraged--it makes some sense.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my problem:<br/>\nLove that is ONLY contingent and conditional seems to be payment, not love.  But &quot;love&quot; that&#39;s based on nothing with NO expectations seems worthless.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTear it up, if you&#39;re so minded.  I&#39;m not attached to this at all, and it&#39;s not about any current situation in my house or life. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4231,"nextTopicId":67916}}
