By playing and exploring what interests them,  <br/>\nthey figure out who they are and they figure out how the world works.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s much more learningful to figure things out than it is to be  <br/>\nhanded the information. (Though of course when they ask questions,  <br/>\nthat&#39;s reaching out too, and we answer.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey even figure out math by using it as a tool to explore their  <br/>\ninterests. There&#39;s more meaningful math in video games and guides  <br/>\nthan in a 4th grade math book. Kids *use* math to extract meaning  <br/>\nfrom what they&#39;re doing and in the process learn -- as a side effect  <br/>\n-- how numbers work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Should<br/>\n&gt; I just go about my day and stop whatever I&#39;m doing when they come to<br/>\n&gt; me?
