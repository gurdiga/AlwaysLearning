Depends how well you feel you can take what she throws back!<br/>\nI tend to put my 2 cents in...(kinda like now?)  Sometimes if you have excellent tack, you can <br/>\nreally open their eyes. Sometimes if you have some of the skills of some of the ladies in this<br/>\ngroup, you can seriously improve a child&#39;s life.  Sometimes, they will look at you like your a freak<br/>\nif you fail to get the point across or if they are just locked in their ways.  So what can you handle?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy spouse constantly reminds me to sow good karma.  ( He also keeps a running tab of when <br/>\nI withdraw from my karma bank, lol)  No good come back goes without a payment he says.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo with your gut.
