I too banned it (the thought of it makes me shudder with disgust) and would politely say; &quot;we don&#39;t have that in our home&quot; or &quot;we don&#39;t play those kinds of games in our home&quot; (double yuck!). When Lewi got interested in Pokemon through our neighbour at the time, I was so concerned. I tried as many ways as possible to try to manipulate him out of Pokemon. (so too with pretend gun play which started around the same time) The more I did this the more he wanted it. The poor little thing! Once he turned 5, he was still into it and I realised that the way  I was handling it was really not working nor helping. I started looking into self-regulation and what that means for children. Although I&#39;d been unschooling for a little while and practicing attachment parenting the whole of Lewi&#39;s life, I hadn&#39;t fully grasped the self-regulation concepts. It made me realise how much I still controlled in his life and I decided I wanted to change some things about the way I was manipulating him (regarding TV watching and &#39;violent&#39; type stuff). On looking into it I relaised there was even more freedom to be had and since then, (especially since finding this group!) I&#39;ve grown continually forward. It&#39;s so freeing and so beautiful to relish in our children&#39;s joy - whether it&#39;s our cuppa of tea or not. The bond only flourishes between us. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m so pleased that I found it all out sooner rather than later (I&#39;d say Lewi would agree on that one too!)<br/>\n<br/>\nKim<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: diana jenner <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, July 10, 2006 5:40 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Expansion<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra Dodd wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; when Pokemon came along I couldn&#39;t bring<br/>\n  &gt; myself to care as much as I should have.

Keith was working  out of  <br/>\ntown, we were hosting a weekly get together that had gone from being  <br/>\nin parks to just being at our (newer, bigger) house every week, and  <br/>\nHolly was bigger and needed lots of attention, and I failed to get  <br/>\nthe names of Pokemon characters straight.

That was  <br/>\nsewing, though, not &quot;Pokemon.&quot;  And I&#39;m glad his favorite was one  <br/>\nthat lent itself easily to applique!  And I&#39;m sorry he grew up to be  <br/>\n6&#39;3&quot; or so and as big as a freezer, because had he been a scrawny guy  <br/>\nthat shirt might&#39;ve fit him a long time. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI still to this day sometimes find a Pokemon card stuck in some odd  <br/>\nplace, and I put them all in a lost-parts collection drawer.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby got his first job because of Pokemon, and the adult aversion to  <br/>\nit.

Those Pokemon tournaments were  <br/>\nvery elaborate, with weekly pins you could only get by participating  <br/>\nthat week, and special cards sometimes.  Kirby understood it really  <br/>\nwell, at thirteen, and used to help them.  The rules said only store  <br/>\nemployees could run the tournaments (because it involved  <br/>\nresponsibility for inventory, and judging, and reporting), so they  <br/>\nhired him as soon as he turned 14 and Pokemon was his chief  <br/>\nresponsibility.

Ds gets something deep from poetry and music. He<br/>\n listens deeply to words and musical notes, and they actually have an<br/>\n  internal, enriching effect on him. I don&#39;t have the same experience. <br/>\nBut<br/>\n  because I recognize that HE does, I honor it, respect it, find <br/>\nopportunities<br/>\n  for more of it for him. I deeply listen to him recite his writings, <br/>\nlisten<br/>\n  to his music, engage in extensive discussions with him, look for <br/>\nthings of<br/>\n interest on the internet and in stores, look for what&#39;s going on in the<br/>\n  poetry and music scene in the local venues, etc. Even though my juices <br/>\ndon&#39;t<br/>\n  get turned on by these things, my life has certainly expanded because <br/>\nof my<br/>\n  willingness to delve into my son&#39;s passions. And most importantly, my <br/>\nson<br/>\n  has had more opportunities to really get into these passions. This is <br/>\nan<br/>\n important part of his journey.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So I was thinking about how this &quot;behavior&quot;...the behavior of <br/>\nenveloping an<br/>\n  interest that a person doesn&#39;t have themselves so that their child can <br/>\nhave<br/>\n more experiences with it...is what some parents sometimes have so much<br/>\n  trouble with (myself included at times). Video gaming for <br/>\nexample...for so<br/>\n  many, just the mention of the word &quot;video games&quot; turns off the <br/>\nconnection<br/>\n switch right there. Parental interest engines shut down...no help, no<br/>\n connection, no support. So sad.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So I&#39;m challenging myself to look for the areas where my engines may <br/>\nslow<br/>\n  down a bit with my children and their interests, and pumping more fuel <br/>\nin.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n I think this is soooo important!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I know *my* world has been opened in so many ways by my children&#39;s and <br/>\nmy husband&#39;s interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But I also know it&#39;s so much easier when they coincide in some <br/>\nway---or if the boys are engaged in something I deem &quot;worthier&quot; in some <br/>\nway. It was so much easier to shell out the big bucks when it&#39;s <br/>\nsomething *I* am interested in. Like magic. When Cam was into magic, I <br/>\nwas delighted to pay for new effects &#39;cause I loved magic. It was <br/>\nharder when he was into skateboarding. I had to make myself pay for new <br/>\nwheels or trucks---ans smile at the same time. Going to the magic <br/>\nPhoenix Gathering i n Baltimore was easy. I had had to almost force the <br/>\nsmile as I drove him to Woodward Skateboard camp; but Cam was so <br/>\nexcited, that smile was contagious! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ben would *love* to buy Duncan a $500 bicycle. I know he hesitates <br/>\nwhen he pays for $10 Yu-Gi-Oh decks! &lt;g&gt; But I think that&#39;s a huge, <br/>\nimportant necessity in unschooling. We really do need to accept and <br/>\nembrace what our kids find fascinating.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t care for jazz. It&#39;s no secret! &lt;G&gt; But I&#39;ll sit and listen for <br/>\nhours because it&#39;s what Cam loves (until my teeth hurt! &lt;g&gt;).

Ds gets something deep from poetry and music. He<br/>\nlistens deeply to words and musical notes, and they actually have an<br/>\ninternal, enriching effect on him. I don&#39;t have the same experience. But<br/>\nbecause I recognize that HE does, I honor it, respect it, find opportunities<br/>\nfor more of it for him. I deeply listen to him recite his writings, listen<br/>\nto his music, engage in extensive discussions with him, look for things of<br/>\ninterest on the internet and in stores, look for what&#39;s going on in the<br/>\npoetry and music scene in the local venues, etc. Even though my juices don&#39;t<br/>\nget turned on by these things, my life has certainly expanded because of my<br/>\nwillingness to delve into my son&#39;s passions. And most importantly, my son<br/>\nhas had more opportunities to really get into these passions. This is an<br/>\nimportant part of his journey.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I was thinking about how this &quot;behavior&quot;...the behavior of enveloping an<br/>\ninterest that a person doesn&#39;t have themselves so that their child can have<br/>\nmore experiences with it...is what some parents sometimes have so much<br/>\ntrouble with (myself included at times). Video gaming for example...for so<br/>\nmany, just the mention of the word &quot;video games&quot; turns off the connection<br/>\nswitch right there. Parental interest engines shut down...no help, no<br/>\nconnection, no support. So sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m challenging myself to look for the areas where my engines may slow<br/>\ndown a bit with my children and their interests, and pumping more fuel in.<br/>\n<br/>\nJacki</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] night swims","postDate":"1151812442","msgId":26199,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ0NEZDMDVFLUI1NDUtNDM5Qi05ODVGLUNGQUUwM0M2NjE1M0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEI4QUJGQ0Q1LUYzMDItNEZGNy04MTdBLUQyMTRCNEMyNjcwQkBjb3gubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PEE3MjlDMTk5LTBFNjUtNEQ5Qi1COUM2LTY0N0Y4MjM5RDQ5MUBjb3gubmV0PiA8MzlFQjYzMDYtOERFQi00NjQ1LTg1QTUtOThDOTVCQUFGQUMzQHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8QjhBQkZDRDUtRjMwMi00RkY3LTgxN0EtRDIxNEI0QzI2NzBCQGNveC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":26198,"nextInTopic":26200,"prevInTime":26198,"nextInTime":26200,"topicId":26194,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-we re not worthy-=- Every story that helps someone else get it is a perfectly wonderful story. -=-I ve got some pictures on my blog.-=- I linked the blog","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-873259447\">-=-we&#39;re not worthy-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery story that helps someone else get it is a perfectly wonderful  <br/>\nstory.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I&#39;ve got some pictures on my blog.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI linked the blog there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t mind that people will cut out of my site and go elsewhere.   <br/>\nIt&#39;s a good model of how unschooling can work best that they&#39;ll zig  <br/>\nand zoom hither and yon around the internet and other places, from  <br/>\nsomething they read that an unschooler wrote.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205483142,"authorName":"Melissa","from":"Melissa &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;","profile":"multimomma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] night swims","postDate":"1151809703","msgId":26198,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI4QUJGQ0Q1LUYzMDItNEZGNy04MTdBLUQyMTRCNEMyNjcwQkBjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDM5RUI2MzA2LThERUItNDY0NS04NUE1LTk4Qzk1QkFBRkFDM0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEE3MjlDMTk5LTBFNjUtNEQ5Qi1COUM2LTY0N0Y4MjM5RDQ5MUBjb3gubmV0PiA8MzlFQjYzMDYtOERFQi00NjQ1LTg1QTUtOThDOTVCQUFGQUMzQHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":26197,"nextInTopic":26199,"prevInTime":26197,"nextInTime":26199,"topicId":26194,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"we re not worthy....we re not worth Thanks Sandra.

So I picked up a CASE of  <br/>\nthe glowsticks. It was maybe $10 altogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe came home, grilled out, sat out and played cards (FLUXX and  <br/>\nWaterWorks) for a while, and after everyone was ready to transition,  <br/>\nI suggested maybe it would feel good to swim (honestly, 100 degrees  <br/>\ntoday and too hot to swim in the afternoon! 80 degrees at ten pm last  <br/>\nnight, and it felt wonderful!) It&#39;s just odd enough, because usually  <br/>\nI&#39;m hesitant to get them swimming so late, cranky neighbors, hard to  <br/>\nsee, I&#39;m exhausted....So while they jumped in, I ran inside, got my  <br/>\nswimsuit and opened up all those glow sticks. In the pool, I cracked  <br/>\nthem all open and started quietly distributing them around the pool.  <br/>\nTHe girls were THRILLED. We had so much fun swimming around diving  <br/>\nfor sticks. The girls experimented with placing them in different  <br/>\nareas and distribution, and we all agreed that we need to have a  <br/>\nparty and invite everyone over to swim late at night.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was so beautiful to see their happiness and contentment shining in  <br/>\npool late at night. The soft glow through the water was enough to  <br/>\nlight their faces, and they were happy to be out and playing games  <br/>\nwith dad and mom. We floated in the noodle chairs and watched  <br/>\nlightening bugs. We counted stars and adopted some as our own. We all  <br/>\ngathered around Avari in her baby floatie and laughed as she splashed  <br/>\nher way around to try and get the floating glow sticks. Rachel  <br/>\nlearned to dive under water so she could catch as many as Emily was  <br/>\ngetting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI took the big plunge with unschooling, and I&#39;m still finding little  <br/>\nthings I didn&#39;t realize I was ruining for everyone. We stayed up  <br/>\nswimming until midnight. The little ones got out on their own and  <br/>\nclimbed into bed as they got tired. i was surprised to come in and  <br/>\nsee them down. Josh had stayed inside to play video games, and he  <br/>\nhelped settle Dan into bed with kisses and storytime. :-) He&#39;s so  <br/>\nhelpful...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I might blog it later, I&#39;m still tired and maybe not  <br/>\nverbalizing well how cool it was. Even if you have a wading pool, it  <br/>\nwould be cool. We were also talking about how it would be fun to use  <br/>\nthe necklace length ones and tape them onto our homemade water park....<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (8), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (4), Dan  <br/>\n(2), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26375,"nextTopicId":26842}}
