[smiley face]<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for all you&#39;ve done for my family!<br/>\n<br/>\n[heart] [name]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly&#39;s been doing childcare for two girls who are (I think) three and five.  They live in an apartment complex with a pool, and Holly has been playing with them in the water, and they&#39;ve learned to swim (I think; or learning more).  That&#39;s how Holly learned to swim, playing with another family that had two girls, and they would borrow Holly to play, and the dad would play games with them in the pool at their apartment.  Holly has a nice tan, and has been making good money ($10 an hour for both girls, $8 for one).<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s what seems to me to be the coolest part:  The mom is the current live-in girlfriend of Holly&#39;s once-serious, now-ex boyfriend.  So it&#39;s not only about how Holly is at work, but how she is in relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I&#39;m bragging on my kids anyway, here&#39;s an older but visible bit about Kirby some years back.  Kirby is a senior where he works now (a job title), after having worked for Blizzard in Austin for four years, but the feedback is from when he was working at Dion&#39;s pizza:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/kirbyatdions\">http://sandradodd.com/kirbyatdions</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHolly&#39;s job is mostly ending, at the end of summer, but her employer is working and going to the university, so there will be times.  The girls will be in school.  The older one goes to a Campfire program after school for three hours.  WHAT a long day.  Holly&#39;s sad to think about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62564,"nextTopicId":62628}}
