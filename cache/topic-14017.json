It has little to do with anything, except I <br/>\nhave always loved religious music and this has some particularly good stuff.  <br/>\n It has more than one kind of MIDI thing on some, and the words are there, <br/>\nand the versions are long enough to sing four verses WITH an intro and it has <br/>\nDona Nobis Pacem (an old round) and lots of music stuff.  It&#39;s really <br/>\nwonderful and has four part harmonies...  <br/>\n<br/>\nWowie.  Even if you&#39;re not into church music, there will be some stuff there <br/>\nyou might like.  In the Christmas section they have some things which are <br/>\ntraditional and have only become well known in the past few decades.  Newish <br/>\ntwo or three hundred year old songs. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has &quot;Be Thou My Vision,&quot; one of the best songs ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough the site seems liturgically Catholic, the music is mixed, and there&#39;s <br/>\na fair amount of it! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDo the links ever work for anybody?
