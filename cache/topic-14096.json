I was perfectly happy not knowing my exact due <br/>\ndate. I pieced together some information with a friend (we&#39;d had plans during <br/>\nmy last period) and with the midwife, got a rough due date of Jan. 29th.<br/>\nMy poor mother was beside herself that I wasn&#39;t going to have ANY tests, no <br/>\nultra-sound, nothing.<br/>\nWith our family history, she thought I really, really needed an ultra-sound <br/>\nto confirm due date. Silly. I knew it was silly. But she had cancer and was <br/>\ngoing to be my birth coach and I didn&#39;t want her stressing out, so stupidly, <br/>\nI agreed to an ultra-sound.<br/>\nI really wish I&#39;d trusted myself more and not let her pressure me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ultra-sound gave us a due date of Jan. 15th.<br/>\nBy the end of January I was getting nervous. My mother had a history of not <br/>\ngoing into labor until babies were WAY overdue. My sister had to be <br/>\nresucitated because she really should have been born sooner. The placenta was <br/>\nstarting to calcify and such....and she&#39;d been induced as it was. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhoo......here I was getting worried, wanting this baby to be born RIGHT <br/>\nNOW! And here he comes, perfect and healthy on Feb. 2nd. Right when he was <br/>\nready.<br/>\nThe midwife said there were absolutely NO signs that he was past due.<br/>\nThe placenta was healthy and viable, he had no waxiness or anything.<br/>\nFeet weren&#39;t overly wrinkled. He was perfect!<br/>\n<br/>\nTrusting ourselves and our bodies goes right along with unschooling in my <br/>\nmind.:)<br/>\nListening to the so called &quot;experts&quot; over our own intuition, gets us into <br/>\ntrouble in every aspect of life. &#39;Course some people have zero intuition left.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;They dined on mince, and slices of quince, Which they ate with a runcible <br/>\nspoon;<br/>\nAnd hand in hand, on the edge of the sand, they danced by the light of the <br/>\nmoon.&quot;<br/>\n                                                --The Owl and the Pussycat      <br/>\n                                        Edward Lear</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14073,"nextTopicId":14099}}
