Wanting to eat flour","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1076197746\">&quot;I&#39;m sorry you are making fun of me because my child is eating a cup of flour <br/>\nwith a spoon. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Sandra was asking for clarification. Wanting to eat flour could mean <br/>\nthat she only wants foods made with flour, but it could also mean as you <br/>\nclarified that she actually eats flour.  That probably seems confusing to some.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m just trying my best and my child happens to be extreme. She always  has <br/>\nbeen. When she was three she decided to wear nothing but princess  dresses with <br/>\nhats and feathers in the hat. Night and day and we let her.  Then exactly one <br/>\nyear later she declared she didn&#39;t want to wear  dresses, but at that time I had <br/>\nno jeans!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Rowan, 4.5yo, is a lot like this as well, but I used to be/can be also, so I <br/>\nwork very hard to have compassion for how challenging it is to be her at times <br/>\n(to want/need to wear a particular piece of clothing *so* badly that if not <br/>\nfound *immediately* it sends her into an angry, disappointed rage of sorts) as <br/>\nwell as understand her and how to be with, live with, work with her, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as food is concerned, I am not going to answer your query directly <br/>\nbecause Rowan does not eat what most people would consider to be a &quot;balanced&quot; <br/>\ndiet.  She LOVES sugar, and will ask specifically for something &quot;sugary&quot; or <br/>\n&quot;sweet&quot; throughout the day.  But &quot;sweet&quot; has a range, so we keep lots of fruit <br/>\navailable, organic yogurt, high quality dark chocolate, etc. We also <br/>\nconsistently offer/put out other faves like pastas, pizza, hot dogs, hummus and <br/>\ncrackers, cheese and crackers, etc. (all which taste a little sweet). Some times <br/>\nshe eats nothing but the &quot;sweet&quot; foods, some times a little sweet and a little <br/>\nof the other foods, and some times a lot of a range. I used to be concerned, and <br/>\nsome days I feel like she is not consuming enough protein or &quot;colors&quot;, but then <br/>\nshe usually makes up for it another day by eating 3 chicken hot dogs, a plate of <br/>\ncheese, and a turkey sandwich.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I struggled with food and my body image growing up, so before her birth, I <br/>\nmade a promise to myself and to Rowan that I would not make food a big deal (not <br/>\npush for her to eat what she doesn&#39;t want to or doesn&#39;t like; not push for meals <br/>\nto be at a specific time of day; not push for eating all that you are <br/>\ngiven/take, etc.). I believe that this has given room for food to be whatever it <br/>\nis for Rowan rather than what I or her dad think it should be for her (note: dad <br/>\nis still really struggling with this, esp. because he works in restaurants with <br/>\nfood and hospitality and loves it). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I would say, trust your daughter that she will eat more than flour at some <br/>\npoint, and likely soon. In the mean time, you could offer her foods that are <br/>\nsimple and simple to eat (flour is rather tasteless without other ingredients, <br/>\nso maybe she&#39;s seeking simplicity). Maybe you could ask if she&#39;d like pasta <br/>\nsince it is basically flour and water. You could make a game of it with her- how <br/>\nmany foods contain flour, from most basic to more complex. When I turn things <br/>\npositive and fun rather than getting caught up in how difficult I think my <br/>\ndaughter is being, it is so much more interesting, fun, relaxed, and Rowan tends <br/>\nto desire and be open to more connection then too (as long as she doesn&#39;t feel <br/>\nlike I am being condescending or making fun of her-- this is key for us).<br/>\n<br/>\nHang in there. And, more importantly, keep doing all the things that you love <br/>\nwhere food is concerned. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa B<br/>\n<br/>\n Lisa Biesemeyer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Has anyone had this experience?","postDate":"1291386318","msgId":58268,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEMzOTU4MTExLThCRjAtNDQxOC1BNUI3LTdCQkI5NzQxNEQ2OEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDQwOTdBQzQ5LTEzRUUtNDlGNy1BNzdCLUUzRTlGNDU4RTA1QUB5YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGlkYXM3ZitxNmI5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NDA5N0FDNDktMTNFRS00OUY3LUE3N0ItRTNFOUY0NThFMDVBQHlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":58267,"nextInTopic":58270,"prevInTime":58267,"nextInTime":58269,"topicId":58235,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-we talk about anger as an emotion that we were created with, that it s part of us.

I read your links and appreciate them. <br/>\nWhen I said my child is extreme it&#39;s because she has huge emotions and responses to things. I never met any other child who would only wear frilly, Disney, itchy dresses even to bed for a solid year, then one day very suddenly swings in the opposite direction to wanting only jeans and t-shirts. Her emotions are very much that way too. Very angry to very lovey in an instant. Sometimes I&#39;m exhausted! Hope no one is offended by these comments. I&#39;m a little uncertain about my words.<br/>\nLast night as I was writing my response Liv, my daughter, asked what I was doing. I said *Remember when we decided not to do phonics and math u see anymore? And how you could eat more of the things you like?* She smiled big and jumped in my lap to show her glee! *Well, I&#39;m writing to people who also have done that and have had experiences that might help me* So, that was enough to allow me to finish. Then when I was tucking her into bed she said *About that eating thing... I think I would like to eat your chicken soup at the end of each day*!<br/>\nEarlier in the day she came up to me and said, *I know that when I ask you for maple syrup you are going to have a hard feeling and that makes me sad*  I simply said * I&#39;m sorry that makes you sad. Thank you for telling me how you feel* And she leaped into my arms and gave me a bear hug.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-I&#39;m sorry you are making fun of me because my child is eating a cup of flour with a spoon.

I&#39;m just trying my best and my child happens to be extreme. She always has been. When she was three she decided to wear nothing but princess dresses with hats and feathers in the hat. Night and day and we let her. Then exactly one year later she declared she didn&#39;t want to wear dresses, but at that time I had no jeans!! Anyway, she hated homeschooling and as I mentioned she made no bones about telling anyone how much she hated it. So I looked into unschooling and believed that was the best way for her. Since I read more and decided to give up more control I saw a spring effect. And maybe I didn&#39;t need to post this because I know who she is and that she is and always had been extreme.

Keep making your bread and raising your chickens and enjoy it.  In the meantime support their choices too and let them find value their own way.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents were very keen on food, my father especially keen on Indian food but I hated it as a child- the textures and sauces rather than the heat.  There was one particular dish (Marsala Fried Potatoes) that my father made every week as a special treat for them to eat in front of their favourite TV show, and every week he made me scrambled eggs and chips instead, bless him.  Now, as a adult, Marsala Fried Potatoes is my favourite dish (it has to be made by my dad, or it just isn&#39;t the same), and I always choose it for special meals when I get the chance.  I don&#39;t think that would be true if I had been forced to eat it every week as a child.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to avoid turning into your parents! Let them enjoy their own explorations before starting work on their sourdough starters and allotments.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr maybe they&#39;ll go a completely different route- but if that&#39;s the case then far better for you to support them than alienate them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;livwithroz&quot; &lt;livwithroz@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve recently let go of control of my kids meals.
