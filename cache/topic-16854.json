You should have seen me as a child, I was literally <br/>\nforced by my parents to learn to get along in social situations, and I <br/>\noften felt (feel?) very uncomfortable, teased, and not very well liked.  <br/>\nI had the oppotunity to be in gifted classes, but my parents felt that I <br/>\nneeded to learn to get along with my peers, and because of the fact I <br/>\nwas gifted and different, I was teased constantly.  I hated school and <br/>\nlearned to hate social situations.  During park days, I have to repress <br/>\nthese feelings, and social situations are very uncomfortable for me.

Mark is an extrovert.  If I have to do too many <br/>\nthings with people (like too many parties or gatherings over a short <br/>\ntime period (a weekend), especially if I have to be &quot;on&quot; like a LLL <br/>\nMeeting or Girl Scout function when I am in charge or in the classroom <br/>\nas the teacher&quot; I need to have quiet time alone to recharge.  Now that <br/>\nI&#39;m &quot;on&quot; in the classroom 8 hours a day, and coaching and brownies and <br/>\nLLL during the week, etc. I feel as though on the weekend I need more me <br/>\ntime, so I limit stuff to one day.
