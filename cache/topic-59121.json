They were showing Godzilla movies and some other Japanese <br/>\nmonster movies.   We watched and recorded them.   Last week Dylan (now 18) <br/>\npulled out those old tapes and we watched them again.  I made his favorite <br/>\ncookies, we had snacks and popcorn.

It was wonderful.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe didn&#39;t have other plans that he opted out of to be with me, but he made <br/>\nplans to include me and I&#39;m so grateful.
