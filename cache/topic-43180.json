It&#39;s why  <br/>\nwe have reference books &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuppose Holly had written that sentence for publication. If she had  <br/>\ncreated a character who was saying this, a copy editor might leave it,  <br/>\nas this might be exactly how this character would speak. Sort of  <br/>\nstream-of-consciousness.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, if she had written it in non-fiction, an editor might suggest  <br/>\nre-writing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, (checking my Chicago Manual of Style &lt;g&gt;) &quot;Steven plays  <br/>\nsaxophone&quot; is an independent clause. &quot;Who I work with&quot; and &quot;who wasn&#39;t  <br/>\nvery nice to me yesterday&quot; are subordinate clauses.  The phrase  <br/>\nbeginning with the conjunction &quot;but&quot; - &quot;but that doesn&#39;t matter&quot; - is  <br/>\na conjunction linking an independent clause to a subordinate clause  <br/>\n(conjunction is &quot;but&quot;; the independent clause is &quot;that doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nmatter&quot;). Everything between &quot;Steven&quot; and &quot;plays saxophone&quot; are also  <br/>\ninterrupters (interrupting the main thought). There are general rules  <br/>\nfor punctuating the subordinate clauses and interrupters.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, a copy editor might suggest rewriting the sentence this way:  <br/>\n&quot;Steven - who I work with and who wasn&#39;t very nice to me the other day  <br/>\n(but that doesn&#39;t matter) - plays saxophone.&quot; Or they might suggest  <br/>\ncompletely recasting it to: &quot;Steven, who I work with, plays saxophone.  <br/>\nHe wasn&#39;t very nice to me the other day, but that doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, whether it would be one sentence or two would also depend  <br/>\non what was written before or after. Is the fact that he wasn&#39;t very  <br/>\nnice more important than playing the saxophone, regardless of the  <br/>\ndisclaimer &quot;but that doesn&#39;t matter&quot;? Or was the point that he plays  <br/>\nsaxophone? It can get rather complicated!<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who enjoys diagramming sentences, as my instructor does,  <br/>\nit&#39;s like a word puzzle, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy class has been enlightening. I remember my English teachers&#39;  <br/>\nadmonitions to &quot;never start a sentence with a conjunction&quot;,  and  <br/>\n&quot;never end it with a preposition&quot;? Bunk!  I love this quotation from  <br/>\nCharles Allen Lloyd in 1938:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Next to the groundless notion that it is incorrect to end an English  <br/>\nsentence with a preposition, perhaps the most wide-spread of the many  <br/>\nfalse beliefs about the use of our language is the equally groundless  <br/>\nnotion that it is incorrect to begin one with &#39;but or &#39;and.&#39; As in the  <br/>\ncase of the superstition about the prepositional ending, no textbook  <br/>\nsupports it, but apparently about half of our teachers of English go  <br/>\nout of their way to handicap their pupils by inculcating it. One  <br/>\ncannot help wondering whether those who teach such a monstrous  <br/>\ndoctrine ever read any English themselves.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI still have to stop myself from questioning my sentences when I begin  <br/>\nthem with &quot;and&quot; or end them with &quot;in.&quot; And (ha, ha!) there are indeed  <br/>\noccasions when starting a sentence with &quot;but&quot; would not be correct,  <br/>\nstrictly speaking &lt;sigh&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I hope that helps. Or maybe it muddifies it beyond recognition  <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128961575,"authorName":"Vicki Dennis","from":"Vicki Dennis &lt;vicki@...&gt;","profile":"vickitexan2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] diagramming sentences","postDate":"1237226188","msgId":43181,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM5Y2ExYmJhMDkwMzE2MTA1Nnc1NTA0YzdmNXJiY2YwMGRhMGFjZmJjZTE0QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDg5MjIxNDg0LTRBRUQtNDdDMy04MjZBLTU2Njk2RTBEQzk4RUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDg5MjIxNDg0LTRBRUQtNDdDMy04MjZBLTU2Njk2RTBEQzk4RUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":43180,"nextInTopic":43186,"prevInTime":43180,"nextInTime":43182,"topicId":43180,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I always thought of diagramming sentences as being similar to setting up equations out of word problems .
