I  <br/>\ncould be wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a report that someone was bashed recently on &quot;my  <br/>\nforum&quot; (meaning, I guess, SandraDodd.com) but I don&#39;t see how that  <br/>\ncould be.    I think some people call &quot;bash&quot; when anyone fails to coo  <br/>\ntea-party-like about their ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, here&#39;s the report.  I&#39;m sure no one was treated this badly on  <br/>\nany forum I was in or involved with:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;KathyJo I just wanted to say I agree with you 100%. I happen to like  <br/>\nthe term horseshit quite well. Very fitting actually. Have you ever  <br/>\nbeen over to Sandraï¿½s unschoolers forum? If not you really should go  <br/>\ncheck it out. A friend of mine sent me a link to it a couple of weeks  <br/>\nago because she got completely bashed there for making a suggestiong  <br/>\nregarding healthy food. I thought that in this day and age nothing  <br/>\ncould shock me. I was wrong. Horseshit on top of horseshit smoothered  <br/>\nin horseshit.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the final word on the forum from which I was banished, because  <br/>\nthe blog owner has promised to delete any future comments.<br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, I think her whole attack on Zach&#39;s writings will backfire  <br/>\nfor her and introduce dozens or maybe hundreds of people to peaceful  <br/>\nideas they NEVER would&#39;ve gotten from conservative blogs or church.   <br/>\nIt couldn&#39;t possibly have made the blog author any friends (not  <br/>\ncounting one or two who went there because they heard there was blood  <br/>\nand they like to be ringside at fights).  I just don&#39;t feel like the  <br/>\nblood was any of mine, nor the horseshit either.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34994,"nextTopicId":34973}}
