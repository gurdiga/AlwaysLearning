There is no requirement for proof online... Apple goes by the honor system, but does do random audits for people who are trying to get more than the allotted number of systems (1 per academic year).

When I worked at the Apple Store, I always asked if there was a student or educator in the family.  The handful of times homeschooling was the answer, I gave the discount.  Specialists have the ability to give the discount, it&#39;s just a matter of what kind of proof they&#39;re comfortable with.  Corporate policy, depending on the state, requires a copy of the full curriculum or a certificate.<br/>\n<br/>\nTax exempt status is a bit trickier, but the education discount ranges from 5-10%, so it basically cancels out sales tax in most places.  If you really want to try and get tax exempt, you have to either call Apple Sales Support @ 800-676-2775 or go to an Apple Store.  I&#39;m not sure if being homeschooling educator officially counts, but it can&#39;t hurt to ask.  The exemption system at our store required a valid teaching certificate #, so your mileage may vary.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps!  The new iMacs are really great values, and the displays (especially the 27&quot;) are gorgeous.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nYuta<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;chiggins1066&quot; &lt;chiggins1066@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My wife and I are homeschooling our two boys and I was thinking about purchasing a computer primarily for educational purposes (an iMac).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know that Apple offers educator discounts, but they require teacher and/or student ID cards, etc. Other stores have similar policies.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any way I can get discounts and/or tax breaks on educational materials I purchase?<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":143043046,"authorName":"Ed Wendell","from":"&quot;Ed Wendell&quot; &lt;ewendell@...&gt;","profile":"zelco123","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Educator discounts and tax breaks","postDate":"1257097631","msgId":48237,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3MUU2QjJGQUZCQTQzQzRBMjUzQUExNDY4QTRCQUVDQEVkUEM+","inReplyToHeader":"PGhjazRvOCsyM2x0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhjazRvOCsyM2x0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48235,"nextInTopic":48243,"prevInTime":48236,"nextInTime":48238,"topicId":48232,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I just simply sat down at the computer and made all 3 of us homeschooling ID cards.
