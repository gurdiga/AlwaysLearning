Canada&#39;s Wonderland was fun, but very, very wet. <br/>\n It was a steady rain all day which left us all with wrinkled fingers <br/>\ndespite our raincoats.  The girls enjoyed it.  I did, too.  Thank you <br/>\nall for your advise.  We all dressed in red tops, although they were <br/>\nusually covered by the rain ponchos.  I gave each of the three older <br/>\ngirls a whistle to wear on their wrist in case they needed to get our <br/>\nattention quickly.  They never needed them.  The only problems we had <br/>\nwere getting in an equal amount of fun time for everyone because it <br/>\nturns out Aislinn, the eldest, adores rollar coasters, while Elysia, the <br/>\nnext oldest, detests them.  Soleille was scared and overwhelmed at <br/>\nfirst, but then was okay as long as she could be with and/or see me.  I <br/>\nwas the ONLY one allowed to push her stroller.  Leiren, our 18m old, was <br/>\ngreat.  She sat in her little umbrella stroller bundled up in a pink <br/>\nraincoat poncho that was about 5 sizes too big for most of the day.  The <br/>\nfew rides she went on, her face was just kind of blank with wonder. <br/>\n Nobody had much of an appetite, so all we bought for food was a bag of <br/>\nchips.  Of course, we had to by a supply of candy bars before we left <br/>\nbecause there&#39;s always some that you can only get in Canada.  Mmmmm, <br/>\n Coffee Crisp Candy Bars!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I was talking to my mil this morning to thank her for watching our <br/>\ndog.  She went on and on about missing those times years ago when you <br/>\ncould take your kids to an amusement park and just let them go off on <br/>\ntheir own.  Then she went on to plug the Disney Cruise Ships because on <br/>\nthose there&#39;s babysitters so the parents can go off and be alone. <br/>\n Listening to her makes me feel very sad for my dh.  Her ideal vacation <br/>\nhas always been to get away from her children.  I can&#39;t imagine missing <br/>\nthose awesome moments of my children&#39;s lives that will be savored <br/>\nmemories (hopefully).  To me, that&#39;s way more fun than sitting in a <br/>\nbeach chair for an hour.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe girls want to go again next year.  Although, I still think one of <br/>\ntheir favorite parts was jumping on the hotel beds for two hours ;)  One <br/>\nof my favorite parts is coming home again.  It&#39;s like taking off your <br/>\nfanciest dress after a great party to slip into your most comfortable <br/>\nsweats.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you all had a great weekend.  Happy June!
