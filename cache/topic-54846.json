I thought I&#39;d dealt with most of the things that had made me feel small or less than in school. I knew there were things like high waders, trousers that don&#39;t go down far enough, that always disturb me. Both Simon and Linnaea are absolutely nonplussed by the length of their trousers, but my rapid growth rate in junior high was such that I was an easy target for comments at a time when I wanted to just fade in to the background. So there is a mixture of horror and envy as I see them comfortably wearing trousers that don&#39;t even brush the tops of their shoes. But I thought that I&#39;d largely moved on from carrying my school baggage. <br/>\n<br/>\nI got a ukulele a week or so ago. Now I had a range of musical lessons as a child. Piano, privately, and violin and oboe, via school, and I think that covers it. My parents firmly believed that the ability to play an instrument was important to being a well rounded individual. I failed at every turn. I hated practicing the piano, however long I had to practice every day. My brother would help me lie to my parents about how much I played, and we even taped a practice session so that my mom could hear me play if she was upstairs working when I was supposed to be practicing. I didn&#39;t want to play violin, I wanted to play fiddle, so I was seriously disappointed with the whole thing and the oboe was just me being different from all the girls who were playing flute instead, like the German classes instead of French. As an adult I&#39;ve tried the guitar more than once, I have a keyboard upstairs that I got a few songbooks for and, well, I just didn&#39;t stick to any<br/>\n of it. And I knew that it was because I wasn&#39;t musical. I&#39;m just not well-rounded. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I got this ukulele, another in a series of musical whims, and I opened the box and I couldn&#39;t for the life of me figure out why I&#39;d gotten it. I had no vision of me playing a ukulele, I had no songs, particularly that I wanted to learn. I&#39;d just a song on youtube that a friend posted on facebook and I got hooked on the idea of a ukulele. So I got this ukulele and I have no expectations from it, but I am enjoying it like I&#39;ve never enjoyed an instrument before. It is quick to learn, and that helps, I get distracted more easily on something with a steep learning curve. And I set a couple of minor goals, like playing Happy Birthday to You for my mom&#39;s 70th birthday via flashdrive. And then I explored, via the internet, what I could learn. I can play, not totally smoothly, but a bit, Ukulele Lady and I&#39;m working on Mairzy Doats. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have no expectations of what this little stringed thing is going to do for me. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll me more or less rounded if I play the ukulele. I did, however, mention it to my dad yesterday, and he completely brushed it off as being a non-instrument. The disdain wasn&#39;t that obvious, but I am sensitive enough to have felt at least a passing sneer. It&#39;s totally possible that I will learn a few songs and then it will go to gather dust like the other instruments in our house do. But this little ukulele has done for me what none of the stuff that I did as a child ever did, nor what my ranting and raving about my school experiences did. It has let me see how much I enjoy making music. And I enjoy the intellectual pursuit of the skill of making music. I like looking for different strumming patterns, I like practicing barre chords and feeling the ache in my hand as the muscles stretch to reach. I like listening to others explain how to do something or other<br/>\n and being able to move away if they get too boring. I like going at my own pace. I like looking to no one else to define my relationship with music via the ukulele. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo that&#39;s part of how I heal from school damage. I enjoy my life doing things that I couldn&#39;t do through school. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: 1000 Sunny &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kleine-familie@...\">kleine-familie@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to know what to do about old school wounds.

I <br/>\nhad been told by lots of people, starting when Roya was in kindergarten, <br/>\nthat my expectations of school were way too high. I had managed to get <br/>\nthem into an experimental school that had no textbooks, had multiage <br/>\nclassrooms, no grades or tests, and tons of experiential learning <br/>\nopportunities. The students didn&#39;t have to all do the same stuff at the <br/>\nsame time - they had &quot;workshops&quot; (stations) set up with lots of <br/>\ndifferent things to do in each one. So, for math, for example, they <br/>\ncould play games, design a board game, do worksheets, play with <br/>\n&quot;wrap-ups&quot; or pattern blocks, or put on a &quot;math play,&quot; build a bird <br/>\nhouse, or all kinds of creative things. There were some minimum <br/>\nrequirements - they had to do something at the reading workshop or <br/>\nwriting workshop each morning and something in the math workshop each <br/>\nafternoon, I think. But how much time they spent on it was up to them <br/>\nAND there were lots of other options, too. There were generally about 10 <br/>\ndifferent workshops available at any time - like art, music, drama, <br/>\ngardening, web design, ...  Reading workshop included listening to books <br/>\non tape - there were big soft pillows on the floor to curl up on. It <br/>\nincluded some games related to books. It included the kids getting <br/>\ntogether and putting on a skit based on a book. It included the game <br/>\nthey called &quot;hot seat&quot; - one kid would sit on a stool in front of some <br/>\nother kids and would take on a character in a book - the other kids <br/>\nwould ask questions and the kid on the hot seat would answer as the <br/>\ncharacter. The other kids would try to guess who she/he was. It really <br/>\nwas, looking back, a rather amazing school with the cream-of-the-crop <br/>\nteachers. Generally, the kids seemed to have a good time with the <br/>\nactivities. I spent a lot of time in the classrooms and, especially for <br/>\nthe younger kids, it really was fun. There were no grades - the teacher <br/>\nwalked around helping kids with their activities and writing little <br/>\nnotes to herself on post-its. The notes were about what she observed the <br/>\nkids doing and learning. A note might say, &quot;RS leadership org games&quot; -- <br/>\nmeaning Roya Sorooshian was showing her leadership skills by organizing <br/>\nother kids in playing games. Throughout the day, she&#39;d put all the <br/>\npost-it notes for each kid on papers and put them into the file folder <br/>\nshe kept for each kid. When it was time for parent-conferences, she&#39;d <br/>\nuse those post-it notes to do a write-up about each student - talking <br/>\nabout what they&#39;d learned, what kind of learning style they seem to <br/>\nexhibit, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet, in spite of having gotten my kids into what seemed like an <br/>\nalmost too-good-to-be-true school, I was never satisfied. There was <br/>\nalways something going on that bugged me. They got a student teacher in <br/>\nRoxana&#39;s class and changed the usual set up so that he could do practice <br/>\nlessons with the whole class. They were awful and frustrating. They had <br/>\na time after lunch every day when the teacher read out loud to the class <br/>\n- they were reading the Goosebumps books every day, week after week, and <br/>\nRoxana was not enjoying them at ALL. The library/media center teacher <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t let the kids in the lower grades get books from the shelves <br/>\nintended for the older grades. They had computer time once a week in the <br/>\nmedia center and it was run by the media center teacher who was <br/>\nextremely controlling and made them do everything step-by-step as a <br/>\nwhole class. They tested my kids for the gifted program, without asking <br/>\nme, and<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - although a lot of what Gatto talked about in Dumbing Us Down didn&#39;t <br/>\napply to the school experience my kids were having at that time, some <br/>\ndid. And, I had a very very strong reaction to it, in relation to how <br/>\n&quot;I&quot; had felt in school and what school had done to me. Once I&#39;d read <br/>\nDumbing Us Down, I just coudn&#39;t not see the problems with school. I felt <br/>\ncompelled to get my kids out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - I think there is good reason to write (and read) about how school <br/>\nsucks. It can help someone decide to get their kids out of school, and <br/>\nit can inform their homeschooling choices once they have pulled their <br/>\nkids out.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then - move on. I remember that I compared homeschooling to school a <br/>\nlot in the first year of homeschooling, but I haven&#39;t done that in <br/>\nyears. How we lived was completely unrelated to school and no longer in <br/>\nreaction to school, once I&#39;d gotten a good grasp of unschooling. I&#39;ve <br/>\nseen John Gatto speak several times since then and I find what he talks <br/>\nabout almost completely irrelevant to our lives. I have to remind myself <br/>\nthat his critical analysis of schooling is probably still meaningful to <br/>\nothers. He&#39;s clever in how he talks about it and creates some good <br/>\nimages of what school is like (fleas in a can with a lid that doesn&#39;t <br/>\nlet them jump as high as they can) and I can see how it might really <br/>\nhelp someone feel more confident in their choice to get their kids out <br/>\nand to not recreate school at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, once you&#39;ve decided to unschool, you&#39;ll get more out of thinking <br/>\nabout learning, rather than schooling, and about how your kids can learn <br/>\nin the whole real world, rather than how their learning is stunted in a <br/>\nclassroom.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: objection to the &quot;school sucks&quot; phrase","postDate":"1276360022","msgId":54879,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVDMDI0QjlCLThBNUYtNERDNy1BNjIxLUZFOURBOEY0M0Y0OUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDRDMTJCRTlCLjIwMjAxMDhAZ214LmRlPg==","referencesHeader":"PGh1dHM5NCt1ZjZrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NEMxMkJFOUIuMjAyMDEwOEBnbXguZGU+"},"prevInTopic":54877,"nextInTopic":54888,"prevInTime":54878,"nextInTime":54880,"topicId":54846,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I would like to know what to do about old school wounds.

Sandra, you seem pretty at peace with school - how did you<br/>\ndo that?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nGradually and consciously.<br/>\nI thought about how I learned the things I know.  Sometimes it was in  <br/>\nschool, sometimes it was despite school, and I thought lovely thoughts  <br/>\nabout my learning however and wherever it happened.  I learned as much  <br/>\nfrom the backs of cereal boxes as from some of my textbooks, because I  <br/>\nreally read the whole thing, the whole box, and was thinking while I  <br/>\nwas reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach time I do something sweet for one of my children, it benefits  <br/>\nthem, and me now, and me-their-age.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow NOT to recover from school wounds:  Dwell there.  VIsiting a  <br/>\n&quot;school sucks&quot; site a time or two might not be bad, but visiting it  <br/>\nevery day, living there, seems to me a way to let school continue to  <br/>\nruin your life long, long after you are in the real, regular world.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a single, childless person wants to spend a LOT of energy being  <br/>\nnegative about school, cataloging school&#39;s ills, revealing and  <br/>\nreviewing school damage, then that&#39;s a hobby.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the parent of unschooled children wants to do that, I think the  <br/>\nenergy and emotion could be better and more positively spent being  <br/>\nmerry and light with children who are not in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one can have everything.  You can&#39;t store up and identify with  <br/>\ncynicism, pessimism and self-righteous ire and still pour out joy and  <br/>\nhappiness to your family.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: objection to the &quot;school sucks&quot; phrase","postDate":"1276296902","msgId":54864,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVBM0I1NEM0LTVBNTAtNEQzQy1BM0Q4LTVCQ0NCNzE4MzYyQkBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGh1dHM5NCt1ZjZrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGh1dHM5NCt1ZjZrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54862,"nextInTopic":54877,"prevInTime":54863,"nextInTime":54865,"topicId":54846,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think maybe it s because it focuses on something that people on this list already know and have chosen to actively do something about, in their own families.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-163371388\">I think maybe it&#39;s because it focuses on something that people on this  <br/>\nlist already know and have chosen to actively do something about, in  <br/>\ntheir own families.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re not here to school bash, we&#39;re here to learn about being  <br/>\npartners in our children&#39;s learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nWallowing in the fact that school &quot;sucks&quot; won&#39;t help people unschool  <br/>\nbetter.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jun 11, 2010, at 10:37 AM, eintob, d.a. wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Out of curiosity I went and checked it out.
