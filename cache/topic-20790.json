I&#39;ve heard about it - it was designed to test the gift-economy at<br/>\nburning man but caused some controversy as one of the other points in the<br/>\nburning man temporary culture is radical self-reliance, and showing up with<br/>\nnothing for your own survival is not at all self-reliant. Further, as a<br/>\nmember of that community myself, I think it&#39;s one of the most exciting<br/>\nlessons in community, culture, and an immersion in the actual development of<br/>\na society. The burning man experience changes as its numbers increase. There<br/>\nis dissent and creative impulse gives way to rules as the growth indicates<br/>\nneeds for safety and other concerns. The experience really gets people<br/>\ntalking about what makes a society run, and which of our rules are needed<br/>\nvs. which are not. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt reminds me of the process art of Cristo and Jean Claude - going into a<br/>\ncommunity and creating some extreme change but the real art is the process<br/>\nthat has to happen to make the creativity possible - the people in the<br/>\ncommunity and how their understanding changes. Burning Man also offers this<br/>\nexploration of the definition of process art - one which eludes many outside<br/>\nthe art community.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIssues of individual freedom vs. interdependent community building, rules<br/>\nvs. expression, personal responsibility, alternative energy, alternative<br/>\ncommerce, and much more are brought out from the hidden architecture and<br/>\nmade points of discussion by their rawness as the experiment grows. I highly<br/>\nsuggest everyone try it at least one year to experience that. I would<br/>\ncaution that the community standards lean heavily toward freedom and might<br/>\nbe too much for some people or for some parent&#39;s ideas about what their<br/>\nchildren should  be exposed to and at what ages. Radical unschoolers<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t have much of a problem but I would have to point out that there is<br/>\na heavy sexual and nudity content and there are drugs (although they are not<br/>\nas open as the sexuality and nudity.) There is no way to create an event<br/>\nthis size devoted to radical self-expression and not have these things be a<br/>\npart of it. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone is interested, I&#39;m heavily involved with KidsCamp at burning man -<br/>\na sort of subset that is involved but a little more protected from some of<br/>\nthe outside freedoms to make it a little easier for families with children<br/>\nto experience this radical experiment - and I&#39;d gladly put you in touch with<br/>\nthe mayor and help you to set up a trip for next year. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSondra<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Gold Standard [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:contact@...\">contact@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Tuesday, September 14, 2004 1:16 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] nothing without you<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone is interested, nothingwithoutyou.net is the website for the<br/>\ndocumentary of the naked guy who goes with nothing to Burning Man to see<br/>\nwhat happens.
