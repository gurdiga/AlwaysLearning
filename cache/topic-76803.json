One of my favorite ways to learn about unschooling was a podcast series by Amy Childs. I listened to each episode multiple times, and found it especially helpful when I was feeling anxious about my decision to unschool. I also subscribed to Pam Laricchia&#39;s intro to unschooling email series. I joined this group and the Facebook group, and I try to keep up with reading the emails and posts daily. I pay attention mostly to the responses of Sandra, Joyce, Clare, Alex, and a few others who have been the core group of unschooling guides since I&#39;ve been a member. I did buy a couple of books on unschooling, after failing to find them in my local library, however, I find little time to sit and read these days. I follow other unschoolers on social media. I get most of my information through social media platforms. The one that failed me was Pinterest. There was just too much going on there, and too many &quot;eclectic homeschooling&quot; things mixed in with unschooling ideas. As for the phone vs computer: I almost never sit down at my computer at home. I read on my phone, listen to podcasts on my phone, and check Facebook and email on my phone.

What worked for me was to decide early on to choose the groups where I had already been reading for a while and that seemed to offer clear, trustworthy information in a very time-efficient way -- Sandra&#39;s groups.</div><div><br></div><div><div>What also worked for me was reading, reading and reading some more. I&#39;m not talking about reading twenty links on your website in a day. Instead, reading something about unschooling and peaceful parenting everyday, even if just a little bit. Even if it&#39;s only a post from Just Add Light and Stir as I wake up or listening to part of a talk at a conference or a podcast while I cook or clean the kitchen.</div><div><br></div><div>It still happens that sometimes I slowly start to feel like I&#39;m derailing and getting more stressed or doubtful when I haven&#39;t read for a while (it happened recently, when my father was very ill and then passed away), so reading a little something everyday reminds me of what&#39;s important and where I want to go. It usually also uplifts me and gives me confidence and that feels so good.</div><div><br></div><div>More things that have worked for me -- actively trying things that I&#39;ve read about. Watching what happens, with me, with my child, with my husband, with my family and friends. </div></div><blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-2043890011gmail_quote\" style=\"margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-left-width:1px;border-left-color:rgb(204,204,204);border-left-style:solid;padding-left:1ex;\"><div style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\"><div><div><div><p> And do you think people really should use a full-screen computer or am I just old and outdated?<br></p></div></div></div></div></blockquote><div>I&#39;m 41 and I prefer to read these discussions and the links to your website on my computer, so maybe I&#39;m old and outdated too? :) Yes, sometimes I do read on my cell phone but it&#39;s usually when I&#39;m still in bed and Conchinha is sleeping (she won&#39;t sleep as much if I&#39;m not there) or when we&#39;re out and about and she&#39;s ok playing with a friend or with her grandmother. Funny thing is that usually I tend read on facebook in those moments and I think it&#39;s because I know I won&#39;t concentrate as much on what I&#39;m reading.</div><div><br></div><div>To me, using a full-screen computer means that I&#39;m reading when I know I&#39;ll have a bit of time to really focus on reading and thinking, even if I know that I might need to stop at any moment to help Conchinha or Bruno, my husband. I do have more time now because Conchinha is really into minecraft and skyping with friends, but even when she was younger, I chose to read a bit every night, after she fell asleep. </div><div><br></div><div>Because I want to know how to unschool well, and because I know firsthand that learning about and living by unschooling principles is life-changing on so many levels, I have made it a priority to have time to focus and read, to think and have a chat with friends/with Bruno about it. This meant gradually letting go of other things, like an unschooling discussion group that I helped moderate on facebook or an unschooling book that I was going to help translate or having a really clean and spotless house or cooking homemade nutritious meals every day of the week. As Conchinha grows and her needs shift, I know I will have time to get back to all of that.</div><blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-2043890011gmail_quote\" style=\"margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-left-width:1px;border-left-color:rgb(204,204,204);border-left-style:solid;padding-left:1ex;\"><div style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\"><div><div><div><p>What’s the best way these days for people to move from “What!?” to “Oh!” about unschooling?</p></div></div></div></div></blockquote><div>I&#39;d say reading calmly, thinking a bit about it, trying out some of the suggestions, waiting as a situation unfolds and we can use those ideas, watching to see what happens when we do something different and how it feels.

In the beginning, I was lucky enough to join a local group with lots of older unschooled kids, when Kai was 3, and that was really helpful too. As for reading, I only read on my laptop - so I can&#39;t comment on how pages look on a phone. I don&#39;t like reading on my phone at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nEarly on, I also found Sandra&#39;s site overwhelming - possibly because it covers so many topics that, at that time, just seemed crazy to me (food, video games, etc). I read a few books - John Taylor Gatto, Alison McKee, and I read bits and pieces elsewhere. I think, when people don&#39;t want to read links, it may be because of some inner idea that *their* situation is different? Unique, somehow? They just don&#39;t understand in the beginning that they are asking the same question that has been asked over and over, so they don&#39;t want a standard response, they want a personal one? Not sure...I&#39;m not articulating that idea very well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI joined (and left a few times in a huff!) Sandra&#39;s facebook group...but honestly it was just time, and having access to other radical unschoolers in our life that mostly helped. By the time Kai was 6 or so (he&#39;s almost 10 now), I was in a place where I LOVED Sandra&#39;s website - I was ready to take all that information on board by then. I re-joined the facebook group, and began to write more on there and on here. Responding to others has also helped our unschooling, though it took a good few years before I was in a position where I thought I could respond helpfully, and I&#39;m still working on my writing [&#X1f60a]<br/>\n<br/>\nJo<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; on behalf of Sandra Dodd <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: 01 March 2016 16:00<br/>\nTo: Always Learning<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] How to learn about unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve lived and learned through many phases of &quot;information delivery&quot; about unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nin another topic, I posted this:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Some of those pages aren&#39;t good on a phone.

recommending that. &nbsp;It&#39;s just what I did to help myself get more centered, I think.) &nbsp;</span></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial,

while, watch&quot;<span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\">&nbsp;did work perfectly for me, but I needed to *not* to go back to reading conventional material at all until I could more clearly see the

conventional writing for a few years, actually. &nbsp;People would send me articles, and I&#39;d mostly ignore them (the articles, not the people ;-) ). &nbsp;I read almost exclusively here, at Always Learning, after trying a couple other places. &nbsp;This was the clearest, most focused place for me. &nbsp;I seemed to need that. &nbsp;Too many different messages were not helpful for me. &nbsp;Too much fluff didn&#39;t fill me up enough.</span></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;\"><span

read the links at first. &nbsp;(I&#39;m sorry Sandra! &nbsp;Again, I&#39;m in no way suggesting this route for others. &nbsp;It was just my own way, and I don&#39;t always take the best route.) &nbsp;I benefitted more from the back and forth of the discussion at first. &nbsp;That dialogue was kind of like trying to get something in focus under a microscope, going too far one way, then back again, iterating back and forth until it was clear enough for me to begin to identify what I was looking at. &nbsp;Then, when I went to the links, I understood the writing better.

and understand them well. &nbsp;I need to go through all the bits and pieces and imagine how it all fits together. &nbsp;Once I have a clear-ish picture, I can look at the instructions and see how they make sense. &nbsp;I&#39;m not suggestion the unschooling links are instructions, but that my own reading comprehension seems to need something solid to build it&#39;s model from, and the discussions facilitated that for me at first. &nbsp;The one thing I really love about the way Sandra has her pages set up, is that so many of them are built off of the discussions. &nbsp;That was really helpful to me. &nbsp;It was a perfect extension of what was becoming familiar to me.</span></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial,

obstacle to learning. &nbsp;Once I became a little more humble, the reading was clearer and easier to digest. &nbsp;I began to see little nuances that I just couldn&#39;t see when I was looking at things as black and white, right and wrong. &nbsp;I really did need to empty my cup before I could successfully begin to learn about unschooling. &nbsp;That was likely the most important thing I did for myself. &nbsp;Perhaps it&#39;s what I was doing while I was taking a break from all reading. &nbsp;I&#39;m not sure. &nbsp;I don&#39;t remember. I wasn&#39;t intentional about it, but I&#39;m glad it finally happened. &nbsp;Now, I make a habit of doing my best to make sure there&#39;s always room in my cup for more. &nbsp;:-)</span></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\"><br></span></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.8px;\">Karen James&nbsp;</span></div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":495438666,"authorName":"Sarah Thompson","from":"Sarah Thompson &lt;thompsonisland@...&gt;","profile":"wallacesmum","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] How to learn about unschooling","postDate":"1456856493","msgId":76805,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBUHYrY1l4SnlRK0oxMFoxdXpHalBUT2p3RmFMd3RtVHk3Vm9RaDVpMGU3Mmo0X0FPZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDlFRTYyMjExLTYxQjQtNEE5Qy05RTlBLTc2NUM0QkJCRTgxM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDlFRTYyMjExLTYxQjQtNEE5Qy05RTlBLTc2NUM0QkJCRTgxM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":76803,"nextInTopic":76806,"prevInTime":76804,"nextInTime":76806,"topicId":76803,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I get a lot out of discussions, *and* a lot out of links.
