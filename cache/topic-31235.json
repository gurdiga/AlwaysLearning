They&#39;re similar.  Confidence grows from  <br/>\nthe inside, though, while courage can be reckless.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty Dodd, my middle child (who&#39;s 18 and so not much of a child  <br/>\nanymore) is living in a big world.  I know that he&#39;s shy, and the  <br/>\nways that he&#39;s shy, but he&#39;s also confident, and some of the  <br/>\nconfidence comes from experience and feedback.  Learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe feedback from school and in school is so very often discouraging  <br/>\nand negative.  Even the &quot;best students&quot; keep being reminded that  <br/>\nevery school has top students and the competition&#39;s fierce.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were talking about javelina&#39;s yesterday, my sister-in-law-of-sorts  <br/>\nand Marty and me. Her grandfather had a javelina head mounted on the  <br/>\nwall in his den and the grandkids were afraid of the whole room.  We  <br/>\nwere talking about how small they are, and how scary, and I&#39;ve never  <br/>\nseen on in the wild and hope never to.  She&#39;s older and lives further  <br/>\nsouth and has seen some.<br/>\n<br/>\nJavelinas are fierce.<br/>\nThoughts about going into the world and finding friends and jobs and  <br/>\nopportunities shouldn&#39;t be thought of as &quot;fierce.&quot;  That isn&#39;t  <br/>\nconfidence building.   Schools claim to expand kids&#39; lives, but at  <br/>\nthe same time they specialize in shrinking them.  Kids who aren&#39;t  <br/>\n&quot;good students,&quot; their lives start shrinking from the time they&#39;re  <br/>\nsix or seven.  They don&#39;t get courage or confidence.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when you&#39;re thinking about what unschooling can bring into your  <br/>\nlife, don&#39;t forget confidence, or courage.  And do things to build  <br/>\nthat, so your children&#39;s lives and worlds expand.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31203,"nextTopicId":31238}}
