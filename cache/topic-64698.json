There are a couple more definitions, <br/>\nbut, to me, this most closely fits what adults generally mean when they <br/>\nsay their kids are manipulating them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf kids are being docked money for not behaving in a certain way, that&#39;s manipulation on the part of the parent, not the kids. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the parenting style was more traditional (punitive) before a family came to unschooling, it can take time for kids to begin to trust they will not be punished and will be treated with the same level of respect with which their parents expect to be treated. Each time a parent reverts back to that punitive style of parenting, it chips away at any trust that&#39;s begun to form. That&#39;s when an apology on the parent&#39;s part is invaluable. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I regret that I did &#39;x&#39;. That&#39;s not how I want to parent.&quot; goes a long way, *if* it&#39;s not happening so often that the kids become immune to it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: not listening","postDate":"1325628240","msgId":64709,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpkdnUwZyttMzNjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGpkdTJkbCtpNGczQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64706,"nextInTopic":64710,"prevInTime":64708,"nextInTime":64710,"topicId":64698,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ************** Piaget called it the concrete operational stage and noted that children become better at logical thinking and using symbols.

My husband&#39;s and son&#39;s behaviors are their own, of course, but because I was the least peaceful person in our house when we were new to unschooling, when I became more peaceful it had a calming influence on all of us. Their naturally-peaceful demeanors, which had been somewhat squashed by my not-so-peaceful demeanor, were able to come forth again. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI consciously made the effort day after day to change my behavior and my interactions with them. I reminded myself often throughout the day to think before speaking. If I felt snappish or edgy, I made the effort to be extra diligent about not saying something to either of them in anger or because I was tired or hungry or hormonal. I let my husband know that if I sometimes didn&#39;t answer right away, it was because I didn&#39;t want to reply snappishly and say something I couldn&#39;t take back. As the changes in my behavior became second-nature, my guys, especially my husband, no longer felt like being around me required him to walk on eggshells. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t directly change their behavior, but my own behavior changes had a direct impact on how comfortable they felt around me and on our interactions with each other.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":494722316,"authorName":"Radha ma Tayay","from":"&quot;Radha ma Tayay&quot; &lt;blissfulcalm@...&gt;","profile":"lilmasters@ymail.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: not listening","postDate":"1325567221","msgId":64701,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpkdTJkbCtpNGczQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGpkdGlxNCtraGRtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64700,"nextInTopic":64702,"prevInTime":64700,"nextInTime":64702,"topicId":64698,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am also struggling with my son s behavior right now but it is mainly due to the fact we are always together without break/ or buffer from a daddy or","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-367936800\">I am also struggling with my son&#39;s behavior right now but it is mainly due to the fact we are always together without break/ or buffer from a &quot;daddy&quot; or siblings which can get very intense.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs per your two youngest i want to share what I read in a waldorf blog regarding the developmental stages of children.  I always stayed away from waldorfy stuff due to dogma but when I read this it really helped me.  Basically as per waldorf perspective of the developmental stages of children around the age of 5 1/2 to about 7 there is a huge shift in what is called the &quot;first purberty&quot; in which occurs an etheric separation from the mother (also coinciding with the first teeth).  This is especially hard on the mother and can be a turbulent time (which is why waldorf does not add academics into this time of upheaval until after 7).  Reading this stuff really helped regain my sanity.  The mainstream does not recognize alot of this.  Personally, it was like reading a description of my child; it resonated.  Maybe it will not apply for you or your children but it really helped me and so wanted to share.   You can google the six/seven year change to get more of a taste of what i found to be an refreshingly accurate description of child development.  Just having this awareness was a support in that it helped me reframe my perspective about my son&#39;s behavior, especially in the face of mainstream parenting and expectation.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;m_aduhene&quot; &lt;m_aduhene@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; i have 3 children but it is my youngest two i would welcome your suggestions about please.  they are 7 1/2 and 5 1/2.  for the past two months i have noticed that when daddy is around the house my children get along fine, they fall out sometimes but life is harmonious. it seems as soon as the door closes and daddy has gone to work or just out then they begin to change their behaviour.  they don&#39;t listen to me, they argue back, they fight more, they roll their eyes and my youngest has this &quot;look&quot; she gives me, sort of staring and defiant.  my son gets a &quot;gangsta&quot; attitude, sort of arms swinging and a &quot;whatever dude&quot; kind of voice.  as they are so young i want to try and stop this.  i am firm with them and explain this is not respectful behaviour.  i am away at the moment with family and am getting emabbarassed by the behaviour.  becos i feel pressure to be seen to be punishing them for this behaviour then i have resorted to knocking money off their holiday allowance which is not what i want to do but now feel i have to carry out.  their dad is not with us on holiday but they are only behaving like this for me and not when their uncles are present.  i am beginning to feel like i am being manipulated.  any suggestions?<br/>\n&gt; thanks<br/>\n&gt; blessings<br/>\n&gt; michelle<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":67727291,"authorName":"Glenda","from":"Glenda &lt;wtexans@...&gt;","profile":"wtexans","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] not listening","postDate":"1325564427","msgId":64700,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMjU1NjQ0MjcuNDY2NDYuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjY1NjA4Lm1haWwuYWM0LnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMjU1NjM5NjguNzk4NzUuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjY1NjA1Lm1haWwuYWM0LnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGpkdGlxNCtraGRtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MTMyNTU2Mzk2OC43OTg3NS5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViNjU2MDUubWFpbC5hYzQueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64699,"nextInTopic":64701,"prevInTime":64699,"nextInTime":64701,"topicId":64698,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"===To find the compassion for what they might be feeling, instead of feeling defensive of how others might perceive your parenting or to feel that your kids","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1623057830\">===To find the compassion for what they might be feeling, instead of <br/>\nfeeling defensive of how others might perceive your parenting or to feel that your kids are doing something *to* you.===<br/>\n<br/>\nThe beginning of that sentence should read: &quot;Try to find the compassion...&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":67727291,"authorName":"Glenda","from":"Glenda &lt;wtexans@...&gt;","profile":"wtexans","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] not listening","postDate":"1325563968","msgId":64699,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMjU1NjM5NjguNzk4NzUuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjY1NjA1Lm1haWwuYWM0LnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpkdGlxNCtraGRtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpkdGlxNCtraGRtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64698,"nextInTopic":64700,"prevInTime":64698,"nextInTime":64700,"topicId":64698,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"===it seems as soon as the door closes and daddy has gone to work or just out then they begin to change their behaviour=== How does *your* behavior change when","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-733405456\">===it seems as soon as the door closes and daddy has gone to work or just out then they begin to change their behaviour===<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does *your* behavior change when their dad isn&#39;t home?

You have the option to say and do things that will move towards repairing your relationship with them, rather than harming it further.

To me, that&#39;s an adult framing a child&#39;s behavior in negative adult terms. If a parent views their child as manipulative, that&#39;s a negative perception of their child. Perhaps you could reframe how you see your children&#39;s behaviors, to consider they are likely *reacting* to something, and then give consideration to what they might be reacting. To find the compassion for what they might be feeling, instead of feeling defensive of how others might perceive your parenting or to feel that your kids are doing something *to* you.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":227835915,"authorName":"m_aduhene","from":"&quot;m_aduhene&quot; &lt;m_aduhene@...&gt;","profile":"m_aduhene","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"not listening","postDate":"1325551236","msgId":64698,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpkdGlxNCtraGRtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":64699,"prevInTime":64697,"nextInTime":64699,"topicId":64698,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"i have 3 children but it is my youngest two i would welcome your suggestions about please.  they are 7 1/2 and 5 1/2.  for the past two months i have noticed","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1701223506\">i have 3 children but it is my youngest two i would welcome your suggestions about please.  they are 7 1/2 and 5 1/2.  for the past two months i have noticed that when daddy is around the house my children get along fine, they fall out sometimes but life is harmonious. it seems as soon as the door closes and daddy has gone to work or just out then they begin to change their behaviour.  they don&#39;t listen to me, they argue back, they fight more, they roll their eyes and my youngest has this &quot;look&quot; she gives me, sort of staring and defiant.  my son gets a &quot;gangsta&quot; attitude, sort of arms swinging and a &quot;whatever dude&quot; kind of voice.  as they are so young i want to try and stop this.  i am firm with them and explain this is not respectful behaviour.  i am away at the moment with family and am getting emabbarassed by the behaviour.  becos i feel pressure to be seen to be punishing them for this behaviour then i have resorted to knocking money off their holiday allowance which is not what i want to do but now feel i have to carry out.  their dad is not with us on holiday but they are only behaving like this for me and not when their uncles are present.  i am beginning to feel like i am being manipulated.  any suggestions?<br/>\nthanks<br/>\nblessings<br/>\nmichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64684,"nextTopicId":64679}}
