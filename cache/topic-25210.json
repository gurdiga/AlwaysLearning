Her final straw was a <br/>\npresentation her teacher assigned.  Every child was given an <br/>\nAmerican History symbol and she got Mt. Rushmore.  She was supposed <br/>\nto research it, make a model or poster, write a little report and <br/>\nthen give an oral presentation to her class.  She was fine with all <br/>\nthe requirements except the oral presentation.  Every time she <br/>\nthought about it, she&#39;d burst into tears.  This went on for a few <br/>\nweeks until the night before the presentation.  We tried everything <br/>\nwe could think of to help her but she didn&#39;t know what to ask us for <br/>\nand nothing we were suggesting was helping.  She finally realized <br/>\nthat the only way to not be held accountable to the teacher was to <br/>\nnot be in the class.  When I said &#39;family&#39; decision, I meant my <br/>\nhusband and I talked with her about it so the 3 of us decided to <br/>\njust pull her out of school.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What levers did you use to get her to go along with that mutual<br/>\n&gt; family decision?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmm... I told her that the teacher expected her to do certain things <br/>\nand that I couldn&#39;t get her out of them because I wasn&#39;t employed <br/>\nwith the school.  Yes, I did contact the teacher.  And instead of <br/>\ngiving her grace to skip this project, I was assured that making her <br/>\ndo it was beneficial for her career in school.  So basically it was <br/>\nstay in school and play by their rules, or come home and play by her <br/>\nown rules.  That&#39;s a tough decision for a little girl!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And you made her small.  She was feeling big and out there, and<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;mutual family&quot; pulled her back in.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, that makes sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Bring kids over.  Have all-day play sessions and overnighters once<br/>\n&gt; or twice a week.  If it gets to be too much, she&#39;ll tell you.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m trying, but all the homeschoolers we have met so far are <br/>\ntraditional homeschoolers.  They can&#39;t just drop everything and make <br/>\na playdate because they don&#39;t have time to do their schoolwork.  <br/>\nField trips have to be planned 2 and 3 weeks in advance.  However, <br/>\nwe did meet an unschooler at gymnastics recently and I&#39;m very <br/>\nexcited.  She suggested some unschooling email groups including a <br/>\nGeorgia list which I didn&#39;t know existed.  I was just approved and I <br/>\nwill make every effort at finding people close by to hang out with.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice\">http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice</a><br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Okay, I read this but we had already done that.  I never forced her <br/>\nto go and supported what she wanted to do.  She set her own alarm <br/>\nclock each night.  Got herself up and dressed.  I fixed her whatever <br/>\nbreakfast she asked for, and also a lunch if she chose that over <br/>\ncafeteria food (depended on what they were serving), walked her to <br/>\nthe bus, etc.  She loved everything about going to school except <br/>\nthat she was forced to give that oral presentation and that the <br/>\nclass was depending on her reading high level Accelerated Reader <br/>\nbooks so they&#39;d win the pizza party at the end of the school year.  <br/>\nThe class went from last place to second place during her 4 months <br/>\nin school.  At first she thought it was cool but she stopped liking <br/>\nit because the only books left for her to read were books she didn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to read and the teacher encouraged her to read them anyway.  I <br/>\neven contacted the teacher and told her I did not want my daughter <br/>\npressured to read books she didn&#39;t like and the teacher had the <br/>\nlibrarian help my daughter find some other books.  That lasted a <br/>\ncouple of weeks I guess before they were back to encouraging her to <br/>\nread books she didn&#39;t want to read.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And what you&#39;ve effectively done is bring one of the worst parts<br/>\n&gt; of school home.  She is home compulsorily.  She didn&#39;t choose to<br/>\n&gt; come home.  She broke under pressure, because you didn&#39;t think of<br/>\n&gt; other  solutions from which she could choose.  It was all school<br/>\n&gt; or no school, and she wants to be with you.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Had that been the case, I&#39;d totally understand that.  But I really <br/>\ndid try everything I could think of.  I suppose I&#39;m guilty of not <br/>\nbeing creative enough.  We did think about letting her stay home on <br/>\nthe day of the presentation but when I told her that I couldn&#39;t <br/>\nprevent the teacher from asking her to give her presentation on the <br/>\nday she returned to school she didn&#39;t want to go back to school.  <br/>\nWhat else could I have done?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Let her have  her way lots, even if her way is to just be in your<br/>\n&gt; lap.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Okay, I&#39;ll keep on doing what I&#39;m doing then.  That&#39;s good to hear.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve even looked into private schools but #1) we can&#39;t afford them, <br/>\nand #2) all the local private schools are Christian and even if my <br/>\ndaughter wanted to attend, my DH refuses to pay money to a Christian <br/>\nschool.  The closest secular school is for kids with learning <br/>\nproblems and you pretty much have to have a doctor&#39;s diagnosis to <br/>\nget into the school, not to mention the hefty $15K annual tuition <br/>\nthat we can&#39;t afford.

She is home compulsorily.  She didn&#39;t choose to come  <br/>\nhome.  She broke under pressure, because you didn&#39;t think of other  <br/>\nsolutions from which she could choose.

You can help by giving her more choices about  <br/>\nlittle things every day.  Let her have  her way lots, even if her way  <br/>\nis to just be in your lap.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244909672,"authorName":"freepsgal","from":"&quot;freepsgal&quot; &lt;freepsgal@...&gt;","profile":"freepsgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Intro and question","postDate":"1145015669","msgId":25210,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUxbzJobCt1ZTdkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":25212,"prevInTime":25209,"nextInTime":25211,"topicId":25210,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everyone, My name is Beth and I live in GA with my DH and 3 children, ages 13, 9 and 8.

We have homeschooled the younger two for 4+ years now.  My <br/>\noldest attends public school due to a shared custody arrangement.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had to choose a label for our family, I&#39;d call us eclectic <br/>\nrelaxed homeschoolers.  We&#39;ve tried some of every methodology, <br/>\nmostly out of boredom, but also out of my passion for all things <br/>\nschool-like (new books, notebooks, supplies, etc.)  I wrote on <br/>\nanother list that unschooling is like our base.  We start there and <br/>\nif we get bored or in a rut, I bring in things (books and textbooks <br/>\nmostly) to give us something to do.  Then something kicks in, like <br/>\nan addiction, and I find myself wanting to follow a schedule and <br/>\ncheck off the list.  The funny thing is that we never stick with <br/>\nanything very long.  Most of the time, the kids are happy to try <br/>\nsomething new with me and then when the newness wears off, we <br/>\nrealize it&#39;s pretty stupid and we stop doing it.  I have had some <br/>\noccasions where I felt the need to push and force and I&#39;m not proud <br/>\nof those moments.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe moved (local move) last summer and by October we were having lots <br/>\nof various issues.  We decided to put the kids in public school.  My <br/>\nds9 hated it from the first day and we took him out a couple of <br/>\nweeks later.  My dd8 (seven then) absolutely loved being in class <br/>\nthough and begged us to keep her in.  She lasted until February when <br/>\nwe finally made a mutual family decision to withdraw her because of <br/>\nthings we didn&#39;t like.  Although she thought it was a good idea, she <br/>\nwas sad that she wasn&#39;t going to be in a room full of kids every day <br/>\nanymore.  After a few days of being home again, she said she was <br/>\nhappy that she was home but.... and here is my major question for <br/>\nthis particular post... she has become clingy and wanting to spend <br/>\nall of her time with me in particular.  Now, I&#39;m not complaining <br/>\nbecause I absolutely adore being with my children.  I just wonder if <br/>\nthere is something I&#39;m overlooking that I might should be doing for <br/>\nher.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe turned 8 in March.  She&#39;s normally an independent sort, very <br/>\nassertive and decisive.  She has a lovie assortment (3 blankets that <br/>\nare named and best friends) that she sleeps with.  Lately, she <br/>\ncarries them around everywhere, and is always wanting to sit in my <br/>\nlap, and is verbalizing that she is afraid to be alone.  I am <br/>\nanswering every want for her and just need to make sure I&#39;m doing <br/>\nthe right thing.  At the zoo yesterday, she was very whiny and <br/>\ntearful and I ended up carrying her part of the time and she&#39;s quite <br/>\nheavy.  I didn&#39;t complain because I felt like she needed me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do see that she is a social butterfly and thrives on being with <br/>\npeople.  We have some homeschool friends that we see every Wednesday <br/>\nat the park.  She has a gymnastics class on Tuesdays that she <br/>\nabsolutely loves.  We&#39;re starting an arts and crafts club on <br/>\nThursdays with a couple of girls to keep us busy while her brother <br/>\nstarts Robotics classes.  She seems to need more though.  Short of <br/>\nputting her back into school, is there anything I can do for her?  <br/>\nCan a really social butterfly like her be happy at home?  I felt the <br/>\nrules and expectations at school were very unreasonable as they were <br/>\ncausing her distress.  But she just seems so unhappy right now and <br/>\nmy heart is hurting for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuggestions?  comments?  Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25213,"nextTopicId":25147}}
