And it was timely for me.<br/>\nMy 5yo daughter and I are in a monthly science club, ten families with a<br/>\ntotal of about 12 kids ages about 4-7.  Some of us are unschoolers, and some<br/>\nare school-at-home types.  I took my first turn leading science club<br/>\nyesterday, and chose SOUND as my theme.  We played &quot;What can you tell about<br/>\nthis sound?&quot; where I knocked or rubbed various things together in a box<br/>\nwhere they couldn&#39;t see what was making the sound.  They listened to see if<br/>\nthey could figure out the size, what the pieces were made out of, or any<br/>\nother information their ears were picking up.  Then I would unveil the<br/>\nitems.  We made telephones out of plastic cups and fishing line; little<br/>\nstringed instruments out of cans and rubber bands; kazoos out of combs and<br/>\ntissue paper; and poppers that make a fun loud bang, out of folded paper.<br/>\n Everyone could choose which projects, if any, they participated in.  And<br/>\nplaying with the paper poppers turned into me showing a few of them how to<br/>\nmake and use those paper fortune tellers (aka &quot;cootie catcher&quot; in English,<br/>\nand &quot;coin coin&quot; in French).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was fun, and thus successful, in my opinion, but two school-at-home<br/>\nparents had sort of a gently disappointed tone that I didn&#39;t cover<br/>\nterminology or discuss the actual science of any of it, other than what was<br/>\nactually observable (like I observed out loud that you can touch the fishing<br/>\nline and feel the sound go through it while people are talking into it).<br/>\n One on one with the kids and parents, I did answer questions, and some<br/>\nterminology did come up that way, for those who were interested, but I<br/>\nfigured each kid would take what they took from it, and maybe one might be<br/>\nstill playing his kazoo comb, and wondering why it feels vibrate-y, someone<br/>\nelse might be running her finger up and down the rubber band and hearing the<br/>\npitch change, or whatever.  I feel really happy that they got to experience<br/>\nthose things.  And they can take it from there.  Or not.  Or not now.  Or<br/>\nyes now.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I (honestly) feel proud of myself that I feel (mostly) peaceful that I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t stick terminology and schematics in to make myself feel like it was<br/>\nmore science-y, and thus value-added.  And I also feel grateful that I can<br/>\ngroove on the fact that the most universally popular part of the day turned<br/>\nout to be the paper fortune teller things, which wasn&#39;t about sound, and<br/>\nwasn&#39;t planned.

And now, if I flip the box over, your air bubbles <br/>\n&gt; will<br/>\n&gt; finally come to the surface.  But they&#39;ve been trapped under the box for a<br/>\n&gt; while.&quot;  And he was playing right along,&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In a way you got lucky, because what you were showing him was so immensely <br/>\ninteresting that the lecture portion was accetable to him. It was going a <br/>\nbit beyond an honest exclamation of delight or surprise (&quot;oh look at <br/>\nthat!&quot;), wasn&#39;t it?<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of this is also your child&#39;s temperament. My dd would probably have <br/>\ntold me to be quiet almost immediately, because my voice would have been <br/>\ninterfering with her process of discovery. She would much, much rather tell <br/>\nme what she was seeing. If I persisted Jayn would have gone away to do <br/>\nsomething else, and a moment of sharing would have been lost.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe pretty strongly that every time you tell a child a &quot;fact&quot; like <br/>\nthis, or direct their observation, or do the movement for them, you deny <br/>\nthem the opportunity to discover it for themselves. The energy of a child <br/>\nbeing told or shown something really cool is great, the energy of child <br/>\ndiscovering something really cool is stellar.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a similar to this scenario, such as the bath or the pool at our house, my <br/>\nfirst job is done when I have supplied a number of different objects with <br/>\ndifferent properties. Jayn has done almost those exact experiments (and I <br/>\nknow what you mean about the challenge of the exact neutral density with <br/>\nwater bottles) in the course of inventing a game of making a &quot;submarine&quot; to <br/>\npush between us like catch. The next part of my job is not describing what <br/>\nwe are seeing, but listening to her tell me what she is discovering.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has also stood at the kitchen sink on the kitchen stepladder, with many <br/>\ncontainers, bottles, measuring cups, warm water and soap on uncountable <br/>\noccasions from the time she was about 18 months old and played water for 2 <br/>\nhours at a time. Her intensity would have been interrupted if I were trying <br/>\nto give her information. I guess in a way I am disagreeing with Nancy, <br/>\nbecause I believe the younger they are the LESS you should be telling them <br/>\nand doing for them in exploration type activities (and aren&#39;t they ALL <br/>\nexploration type activities), the more you should be holding your tongue and <br/>\nletting them joyously discover these basic laws of physics and chemistry.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s no hurry. These physical characteristics of buoancy and liquids <br/>\naren&#39;t going to change any time soon. Trust your feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

And sorry this is so long.lacking personal clarity on this<br/>\nsubject, I&#39;m using a lot of words.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday we were getting in our hot tub, my 3.5 year old son and I.  He<br/>\nloves playing in the hot tub so spends several hours a week in there.  Even<br/>\nthrough the summer, I kept it maintained with the temp about 99 or 100 so it<br/>\nwas still nice to be in there.  Before getting in yesterday, I said, &quot;let&#39;s<br/>\ngo down to the playroom in the basement and get some toys for the hot tub&quot;.<br/>\nWe looked around a bit, and one of the things I grabbed was a clear plastic<br/>\nshoebox-sized storage container without lid.  Initially I saw the box as a<br/>\npotential boat to hold toys journeying on the ocean, and it could also be<br/>\nattacked by toy dinos to capsize it, etc.  Or it could just be an island in<br/>\nthe middle of the ocean. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce in the tub, I discovered many other fun things to do with it, that I<br/>\nhadn&#39;t been thinking about when I picked it up since I hadn&#39;t realized how<br/>\noptically clear the box was.  I was having fun playing with air and water,<br/>\nfor example holding the empty box on the surface and looking through the<br/>\nbottom to clearly see under the water, like a glass-bottomed boat.  Or<br/>\nholding it under the water upside-down with about a golf-ball-sized air<br/>\nbubble in it and rocking it around, kinda using the box as a &quot;level&quot; and<br/>\nseeing if I could get the bubble to the exact middle of the smooth flat<br/>\nupturned bottom (I couldn&#39;t.the bubble would split into pieces every time).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example: we also had a nalgene bottle in the tub, and I would hold<br/>\nthe clear plastic box, completely full of water, upside down under the<br/>\nwater, and it was pretty much neutrally buoyant, then I&#39;d fill the nalgene<br/>\nbottle with air and &quot;empty&quot; the air from the bottle, under water, into the<br/>\nbox, causing the box to float to the top.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs I was playing, I was sharing &quot;facts&quot; with my son.  &quot;See, if you go under<br/>\nnow, and blow air up into the submerged box, the air from your lungs gets<br/>\ncaptured in the box.  And now, if I flip the box over, your air bubbles will<br/>\nfinally come to the surface.  But they&#39;ve been trapped under the box for a<br/>\nwhile.&quot;  And he was playing right along, enjoying just floating the empty<br/>\nbox on the surface and holding his toys under the water, and seeing how<br/>\nclear they looked, or saying &quot;Daddy, ok to do that again?&quot; and diving again<br/>\nto exhale into the upturned box.  None of it was un-fun, and at no time did<br/>\nI tell him &quot;do this&quot;.I was just passing time, sipping a beer and playing<br/>\nwith the &quot;toys&quot; in the tub, offering ideas for more fun.  At no time did I<br/>\nsay, &quot;no, do it *this* way&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I kept pausing, feeling uncomfortably like I had crossed into taking<br/>\nadvantage of a &quot;teachable moment&quot;.  All the things we were doing were things<br/>\nthat anyone could discover on their own by playing with containers in the<br/>\nwater.  I didn&#39;t have an agenda of &quot;teach him this today, to build on<br/>\nsomething tomorrow.&quot;  I felt more like a good friend of mine who&#39;s very<br/>\nsavvy about many different topics because he&#39;s had many different jobs over<br/>\nthe years, ranging from general contractor building eco homes to chef to<br/>\nliving in a van on the interstate keeping big trucks running, who interjects<br/>\nlittle factoids into any conversation, and I love it.  I could just hear<br/>\nhim, sitting in the tub with us, saying, &quot;if you hold the bottle, filled<br/>\nwith water, upside down and let the spa jets blow air bubbles into it until<br/>\nall the water is displaced, you could submit that air sample for analysis<br/>\nand they could tell you about the health of your pump&quot; or something similar.<br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t do those things to be know-it-all.he&#39;s not out-of-touch or<br/>\nover-the-top like Norm on Cheers with his &quot;little-known facts&quot;.

Completely neutral (it was<br/>\nharder than I thought it would be).  My son wasn&#39;t even involved in that<br/>\nbecause I don&#39;t think it looked too interesting to him.I was just loosening<br/>\nthe lid again and again, above water or under water, making tiny adjustments<br/>\nto the ratio of air and water, over-correcting one direction and having to<br/>\nstart all over again.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo help me tease apart the subtleties of this topic, would anyone be willing<br/>\nto give me a few different short specific &quot;scripts&quot; of how the scenario<br/>\ncould play out with the clear container and nalgene bottle in the tub,<br/>\nranging from &quot;not teaching at all, just letting learning happen and being<br/>\nthere to facilitate&quot; to &quot;maybe teaching&quot; to &quot;definitely teaching so<br/>\npotentially harmful&quot;?
