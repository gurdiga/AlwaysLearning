The reason that I ask is because I am<br/>\nstill learning all about it myself and haven&#39;t even figured out the words<br/>\nto say why I am going to start it, just that I know it is right for us.<br/>\nMy brother and his wife never went to high school and are now in their 30&#39;s<br/>\nwith two boys age 6 and 10.  They both work but I think if they felt they<br/>\ncould do better for their kids educationally, one of them would quit to do<br/>\nthat.  They are in a position of having such a lack of education themselves<br/>\n(including the fact that my brother was labeled learning disabled in grade<br/>\nschool) that considering the difficulty that their sons have had in school,<br/>\nfeel that they need to do everything that they can to help them.....ie,<br/>\nspecial ed teacher, counselors, etc.  They live in MN and I live in FL so<br/>\nthere is little I can do to help them out except give them information and<br/>\nI want to be able to give it to them clearly so that they can make an<br/>\ninformed choice.<br/>\nI am still learning myself as I read all your posts and can&#39;t wait till the<br/>\nconference in October.  They have not asked me about this as we do not live<br/>\nin the same state and do not talk about our kids education very often but I<br/>\nwant to at least share my info with them and someone else&#39;s similar<br/>\nexperience so that they can at least relate.<br/>\nThanks for all your help and I will check out the websites that you<br/>\nsuggested so far.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Shannon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68124,"nextTopicId":68137}}
