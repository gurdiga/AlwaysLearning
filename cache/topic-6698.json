The chain has worked closely with civil rights groups <br/>\nin an effort to rebuild its image, Robertson said. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe restaurant chain was targeted as a class-action defendant and was charged <br/>\nby the Justice Department with forcing Black customers to pay for meals in <br/>\nadvance, denying service and refusing to honor its free birthday meals.<br/>\n<br/>\nDenny&#39;s denied discrimination, but agreed in 1994 to pay more than $46 <br/>\nmillion to settle the lawsuits.
