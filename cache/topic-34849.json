Since  <br/>\nits first publication by Delacorte Press in 1976, the book has been  <br/>\nthe subject of acclaim. Many people have been drawn to its message of  <br/>\nsimple living, tradition, and love of nature. However, The Education  <br/>\nof Little Tree has also been the subject of controversy after the  <br/>\npublication of an article on October 4, 1991 by Dan T. Carter (a  <br/>\nhistory professor and distant cousin of Asa Carter) called &quot;The  <br/>\nTransformation of a Klansman&quot; in the New York Times. This article  <br/>\ndescribed Asa Carter&#39;s past involvement with the Ku Klux Klan.[1]<br/>\n<br/>\nThe novel has spawned films, a sequel attempt and a number of  <br/>\ngraduate theses and scholarly articles. In 1985, the University of  <br/>\nNew Mexico Press bought the book&#39;s rights. It has since sold millions  <br/>\nof copies, a rare level of success for a book distributed by an  <br/>\nacademic press, and won the 1991 American Booksellers Association  <br/>\nBook of the Year (ABBY) award.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLiterary, Personal and Political Controversies<br/>\n<br/>\nThe book was part of a blossoming period for Native American memoirs  <br/>\nand genre fiction, both before and after it was shown to be a  <br/>\nfictional work posing as factual memoir. The controversies and  <br/>\ndiscussions surrounding the story are generally centered on these  <br/>\nmain areas:<br/>\n<br/>\n* the clash of the factual details depicted in the book with those of  <br/>\nthe author&#39;s life<br/>\n<br/>\n* the clash between the cultural descriptions given in the book with  <br/>\ntraditional language and culture as reported by Cherokee reviewers<br/>\n<br/>\n* the possible legitimacy of fictionalized memoirs by a member of a  <br/>\nprivileged class depicting life within an underprivileged class<br/>\n<br/>\n* the book&#39;s possible racial sympathies and the possible intentions  <br/>\nof the author<br/>\n<br/>\nThese issues are magnified by the author&#39;s racism earlier in life,  <br/>\nand the fact that little personal information is known about Carter  <br/>\nor his exact state of mind, outside of reports from his wife, between  <br/>\nhis withdrawal from political life and the publication of The  <br/>\nEducation of Little Tree. Carter was an active participant in several  <br/>\nwhite supremacist organizations, including the Ku Klux Klan and the  <br/>\nWhite Citizens&#39; Council. He was also a speechwriter for Alabama  <br/>\nGovernor George Wallace, for whom he allegedly wrote Wallace&#39;s famous  <br/>\nline, &quot;Segregation today, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.&quot;  <br/>\nAlthough Carter claimed to be part Cherokee, in 1970 he ran for  <br/>\ngovernor of Alabama on a white supremacist platform. That said, it is  <br/>\nbelieved by some that Carter wrote The Education of Little Tree from  <br/>\nhis childhood memories of his Cherokee uncle.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the following years, Carter left Alabama, changed his name, and  <br/>\nbegan his second career as an author, taking care to conceal his  <br/>\nbackground. He even claimed categorically in a 1976 New York Times  <br/>\narticle that he, Forrest, was not Asa Carter.[2]<br/>\n<br/>\nThe publisher&#39;s remarks in the original edition of the book  <br/>\ninaccurately describe Carter as &quot;Storyteller in Council&quot; to the  <br/>\nCherokee Nation. When Carter&#39;s background was widely publicized in  <br/>\n1991, the book was reclassified by the publisher as fiction. Today, a  <br/>\ndebate continues as to whether the book&#39;s lessons are altered by the  <br/>\nidentity of the author. As award-winning Native American author  <br/>\nSherman Alexie has said, &quot;Little Tree is a lovely little book, and I  <br/>\nsometimes wonder if it is an act of romantic atonement by a guilt- <br/>\nridden white supremacist, but ultimately I think it is the racial  <br/>\nhypocrisy of a white supremacist.&quot;[3]<br/>\n<br/>\nMembers of the Cherokee Nation have said that so-called &quot;Cherokee&quot;  <br/>\nwords and many customs in The Education of Little Tree are  <br/>\ninaccurate, and some have said that the novel&#39;s characters are  <br/>\nstereotyped. Several scholars and critics have agreed with this  <br/>\nassessment, adding that Carter&#39;s treatment of Native Americans  <br/>\npossibly plays into the romantic but racist conceit of the &quot;Noble  <br/>\nSavage.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Carter died in 1979 he was working on The Wanderings of Little  <br/>\nTree, a sequel to The Education of Little Tree and on a screenplay  <br/>\nversion of the book. Twelve years after Carter&#39;s death, the fact that  <br/>\nForrest Carter was actually Asa Earl Carter was again exposed  <br/>\n(following the original 1976 New York Times expose) by Dan T. Carter,  <br/>\nwho was a distant cousin and history professor. The supposed  <br/>\nautobiographical truth of The Education of Little Tree was revealed  <br/>\nto be a hoax.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 2007, Oprah Winfrey pulled the book from a list of recommended  <br/>\ntitles on her web site. While Winfrey had promoted the book on her TV  <br/>\nshow in 1994, calling the novel &quot;very spiritual,&quot; after learning the  <br/>\ntruth about Carter she said she &quot;had to take the book off my shelf.&quot;[4]<br/>\n<br/>\nDespite controversy surrounding the author&#39;s identity and legitimacy,  <br/>\nThe Education of Little Tree was critically acclaimed and won the  <br/>\n1991 American Booksellers Association Book of the Year (ABBY) award.  <br/>\nIn 1997, The Education of Little Tree was adapted into a made-for-TV  <br/>\nmovie but was instead given a theatrical release. Despite Carter&#39;s  <br/>\nbackground, The Education of Little Tree remains a classic and much- <br/>\nloved story.<br/>\n============<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":284219281,"authorName":"Meghan Anderson-Coates","from":"Meghan Anderson-Coates &lt;meghanandco@...&gt;","profile":"meghanandco","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re:Movies about parent/child relationships","postDate":"1211088095","msgId":34975,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDcxMTY5Mi4xMTAyLnFtQHdlYjU4NjAxLm1haWwucmUzLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":34906,"nextInTopic":34981,"prevInTime":34974,"nextInTime":34976,"topicId":34849,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"************************************ -=-The Education of Little Tree-=- I have an aversion to recommending this on my site because the author misrepresented ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1411256350\">************************************<br/>\n  -=-The Education of Little Tree-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI have an aversion to recommending this on my site because the author misrepresented <br/>\nhimself QUITE fraudulently.

It is about a girl who stumbles in to a family<br/>\nwhere there is a curse on the family and 13 of them are animals from<br/>\nthe chinese zodiac stories (12 in the zodiac plus the cat) and if they<br/>\nare hugged by a person of the opposite sex they turn in to that<br/>\nanimal.  Sounds a little silly, but it is a great story.   It was<br/>\nrecommend to me by my younger brother so I think that it is one that<br/>\nguys will like too.  Highly recommended.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey did make it into an anime and it is well done, but it doesn&#39;t get<br/>\nvery far in the story.  Definitely worth watching, though, and Netflix<br/>\nhas it.  Watch the anime and then you (or your kid) can go get sucked<br/>\nin to the story and read the manga.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Hikaru No Go&quot; is a good anime for friendship.

And there are some wonderful scenes with prisms. While watching it I was thinking about how much it is like Annie. An orphan inspires a wealthy person to change the world, starting from within. Annie is all about child/adult relationships. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlong Hayley Mills lines, I&#39;ve always loved the Parent Trap. Again, it has some really strange things being glossed over, like the fact that neither girl knows the other girl exists. Differences in parenting strategies. Divorce and remarriage and the risks to children when those things happen. One of the most beautiful swimming pools I&#39;ve ever seen. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Addams Family, both the series and the movies. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been reading a lot of Charlie Brown these days, Linnaea likes to have comics by the toilet. We have a few of the Charlie Brown movies. I&#39;ve always found the adult &quot;wah wah wah wah wah&quot; fascinating. The fact that parents and teachers are not given voices or much presence in Charlie Brown. Even in the comic books adult presence is minimal. <br/>\n<br/>\nChitty Chitty Bang Bang, which is the longest film, has Mr. Potts, the dad, sacrifice work hard to give his children the car that they want. And there is a good scene about why the kids aren&#39;t in school. <br/>\n<br/>\nThose are the ones I can think of at the moment. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Tuesday, 13 May, 2008 11:21:32 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Movies about parent/child relationships<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I just watched Pollyanna yesterday.
