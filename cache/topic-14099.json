My <br/>\nmidwife stripped my membranes that early because my baby seemed big (turned <br/>\nout she just had a HUGE placenta) But she was a very healthey 6lbs 14oz and <br/>\nvery alert and definatly didn&#39;t seem 3 1/2 weeks early to anyone.  She <br/>\nprobably could have gone another week or so just for size.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son was born 1 day before his &#39;due date&#39; at my insistance (castor oild <br/>\ninduction :P blech) because he &#39;felt&#39; late too me.  Even though my midwife <br/>\nsaid it was normal to go up to 2 weeks over the due date.  Again I knew <br/>\nexactly when he was concieved.  And he was 10lbs 9oz.  My midwife was very <br/>\nglad I had the insite to say &quot;no, he needs to be born NOW we can&#39;t wait two <br/>\nmore weeks to see if he comes on his own!&quot;  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d hate to think how big he would have gotten in two more weeks!!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we&#39;ve decided is I just cook em faster.  Mine take only about 37 weeks <br/>\nto reach full term.  It&#39;s legened that some women are pregnant for for 10 or <br/>\n11 months and have perfectly normal babies.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not all that far fetched really.  Elephants are pregnant for what like <br/>\na year and a half or something and cats are only a few weeks.  It would be <br/>\nsilly to assume that ALL humans gestate for exactly 40 weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nKatie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe new MSN 8: advanced junk mail protection and 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14096,"nextTopicId":14067}}
