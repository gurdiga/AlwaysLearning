I purchased Moving a Puddle very recently - just a couple of weeks ago on iBooks. I just did a search now on iBooks and they both still show up in the store. <br><br>I purchased The Big Book a couple of years ago off of lulu.com (PDF version). It worked fine on my iMac but when I moved the file to my Kindle ereader the formatting wasn&#39;t quite right - very likely I did something wrong ;-). I kept watching the Amazon Kindle store hoping The Big Book would become available to download, and was very excited to find it on iBooks. Luckily I was able to read The Big Book on my iPad... Now I&#39;m reading Moving a Puddle from my little iPhone screen, as my 2 yr old has taken over my iPad :-) <br><br>Thank you Sandra for these wonderful books. Your words have helped me become a kinder, more patient mother,\n wife and daughter. <br><br>Jen<br><br><br></td></tr></tbody></table><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-376707431ygrps-yiv-1783630948_origMsg_\"><div><br>\n                </div>\n            </div></div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: About my books (was Re: [AlwaysLearning] Happy 12th Anniversary and so many thanks!","postDate":"1386009391","msgId":72669,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM2QzE3NkIwLTA3NDAtNDAyMy05OTk1LTFDQkIzNzYwQTkyRUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzODYwMDI3NzguNjI0NzMuWWFob29NYWlsSW9zTW9iaWxlQHdlYjE0MjUwNS5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDEzODYwMDI3NzguNjI0NzMuWWFob29NYWlsSW9zTW9iaWxlQHdlYjE0MjUwNS5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":72668,"nextInTopic":72670,"prevInTime":72668,"nextInTime":72670,"topicId":72653,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-For anyone with Apple products (iPad, iPhone etc) with the iBooks app, both of Sandra s books can be purchased to download. -=- Does that still work?
