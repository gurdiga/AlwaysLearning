The office is attached to the living room and separated by a door.  When a resident or someone knocks on the door, she often feels like she has to be in the office with me.  This used to be ok, when she was younger and her 2 year old sister was a smaller baby who I could hold in my arms.  But now, it is really getting too crowded.  The office is very small, the kids are getting bigger, they often try to talk over or to whoever comes to the door, and try to run outside.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my husband is home, he watches them in the house while I work.  But when he&#39;s not, it is becoming really hard for me to talk to anyone in the office.  I either have to deal with them being in the office or leave them in the living room and shut the door.  But then my 4 year old will bang loudly on the door, yell and try to barge in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have tried talking to her about how this is my work and what that means, and this is what I do instead of going away all day like some mommies have to.  I have also starting paying her for &quot;babysitting&quot; her sister for a few minutes while I work, which works sometimes.  I try to let her come in the office at times when it is not such a big deal- like when I am just signing for a UPS package or giving a purchase order number to a vendor.  As often as I can, I have people call and make appointments, so that I can be sure that dh will be home to watch them.  But when it is a resident with a problem or a prospective resident who shows up unexpectedly, I need 3 minutes of peace and quiet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54610,"nextTopicId":54640}}
