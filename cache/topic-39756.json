She wants books to have pictures on every page.  She has been<br/>\ninterested enough in a story to forgo pictures once or twice, but it&#39;s<br/>\nrare.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is starting to be interested in longer stories, though, and it i&#39;s<br/>\nhard to find longer stories with pictures on every page.  We have some<br/>\nnicely done fairy tales that are long, but not many chapter books.<br/>\nThe Catwings series by Ursula K. Le Guin is a short chapter book with<br/>\npretty pictures on every page.  Nicely written, too.  There is an<br/>\nedition of Alice in Wonderland that we are reading that has pictures<br/>\non all but one or two pages in the whole book (edited by Cooper Edens<br/>\nwho has edited more books with lots of pictures).  Captain Underpants<br/>\nis fun for her as well.  We&#39;ve looked a bit at comics (Garfield, some<br/>\nmanga) but she hasn&#39;t been very interested.  I think she liked the<br/>\ncomic format, but the stories weren&#39;t the right ones for her.   She<br/>\nloves Spirited Away (as well as Kiki and Totoro) so we are looking at<br/>\ngetting some of the graphic novel versions of those stories:  she<br/>\nloved the idea when I mentioned it to her.  I&#39;m also going to have to<br/>\nthink about manga that she might like... the ones that I read don&#39;t<br/>\nseem to be very interesting to her but I bet there are some that she<br/>\nwould like.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would be very interested to hear if others have recommendations for<br/>\nlonger stories with pictures on every page.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the littles, we just bought a lot of 10 littles books on ebay<br/>\nand I plan to buy the picture book as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, Oct 30, 2008 at 2:40 AM, Joyce Fetteroll &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jfetteroll@...\">jfetteroll@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Oct 29, 2008, at 4:32 PM, Jenny C wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; If you can find it anywhere, there is a book called The Littles and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; their Friends.
