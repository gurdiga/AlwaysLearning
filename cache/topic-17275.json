Well, I should say I&#39;m<br/>\ngoing along, but we&#39;ve got a caving enthusiast who is<br/>\nactually leading the trip.  And we saw the lunar<br/>\neclipse tonight - it was spectacular!<br/>\n<br/>\noh, I talked to my mom on the phone tonight.  Her big<br/>\nworries (she hasn&#39;t written THE letter yet) are that<br/>\nmy son, age 8, isn&#39;t reading and that he is so<br/>\nunhappy.  I told her that I hadn&#39;t thought of him as<br/>\nunhappy, but I&#39;d think about it.  She managed to tell<br/>\nme without yelling or anything, which was nice.  So<br/>\nthat was interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuentin unhappy???

First, there is a total lunar eclipse<br/>\n&gt; occurring during<br/>\n&gt; what is being called the Harmonic Concordance, a<br/>\n&gt; configuration of<br/>\n&gt; planets around the ecliptic in a most auspicious<br/>\n&gt; arrangement. Then<br/>\n&gt; we have the huge coronal mass ejections that our sun<br/>\n&gt; has been hurling<br/>\n&gt; about our solar system, making it highly probable<br/>\n&gt; that we will see<br/>\n&gt; the aurora borealis if the skies remain clear.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A bunch of homeschoolers, friends, and family here<br/>\n&gt; have arranged to<br/>\n&gt; visit a beautiful nature preserve called Woodland<br/>\n&gt; Altars, run by the<br/>\n&gt; Church of the Brethren (a Christian organization<br/>\n&gt; with a mission of<br/>\n&gt; Peace). We will take our field glasses and<br/>\n&gt; telescopes, musical<br/>\n&gt; instruments, and stories to tell around the campfire<br/>\n&gt; circles Friday<br/>\n&gt; and Saturday nights. And we have arranged a bunch of<br/>\n&gt; other options,<br/>\n&gt; opportunities, for Saturday.  Some plan to just fish<br/>\n&gt; and commune with <br/>\n&gt; nature, sit around the campfire circles.  Others,<br/>\n&gt; like me, plan to <br/>\n&gt; visit the many great sites in the area.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; First we plan to visit Seven Caves, a great natural<br/>\n&gt; cave site. For<br/>\n&gt; this we have been watching the NOVA series on caves,<br/>\n&gt; reading<br/>\n&gt; Plato&#39;s &quot;Allegory of the Cave,&quot; and studying the<br/>\n&gt; symbolism of the<br/>\n&gt; number seven in many spiritual teachings, from<br/>\n&gt; Buddhism, to the seven<br/>\n&gt; chakras. Then we will head over to Great Serpent<br/>\n&gt; Mound, the only<br/>\n&gt; Native American fetish serpent site known, made in<br/>\n&gt; the shape of a<br/>\n&gt; serpent uncoiling in seven deep curves. There&#39;s that<br/>\n&gt; number seven<br/>\n&gt; again! For this visit we have been discussing Native<br/>\n&gt; American<br/>\n&gt; spirituality, the symbolism of the serpent in many<br/>\n&gt; different cultural <br/>\n&gt; traditions, and the history of the Moundbuilders.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And lastly we are visiting the Locust Grove Crop<br/>\n&gt; Circle site, which<br/>\n&gt; is just across the road from Great Serpent Mound.<br/>\n&gt; For that we have<br/>\n&gt; been watching the NOVA series on &quot;String Theory,&quot;<br/>\n&gt; studying some basic<br/>\n&gt; quantum mechanics, discussing favorite science<br/>\n&gt; fiction and other <br/>\n&gt; readings about alternative realities, reading<br/>\n&gt; theories about what <br/>\n&gt; might have caused these different geometrically<br/>\n&gt; patterned circles all <br/>\n&gt; around the globe.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We have also studied about eclipses, read about the<br/>\n&gt; Harmonic<br/>\n&gt; Concordance in science and several spiritual<br/>\n&gt; traditions, and studied<br/>\n&gt; about the intense solar activity going on including<br/>\n&gt; the aurora<br/>\n&gt; borealis. Wow! What a weekend. Each night we will<br/>\n&gt; have campfire<br/>\n&gt; circles for music and storytelling. We will set up<br/>\n&gt; our telescopes<br/>\n&gt; and observe the eclipse, hope to observe the aurora<br/>\n&gt; borealis, all in<br/>\n&gt; a tranquil and beautiful setting at Woodland Altars.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Interested home educators from all over the state,<br/>\n&gt; with friends and<br/>\n&gt; family, will gather for this weekend. Some of us are<br/>\n&gt; staying in nice<br/>\n&gt; warm chalets we have rented. Others will bring their<br/>\n&gt; RVs. The very<br/>\n&gt; brave will camp out. Brrrrrrrrr! Even though last<br/>\n&gt; week we saw<br/>\n&gt; record setting high temperatures here, this weekend<br/>\n&gt; the temperature<br/>\n&gt; has fallen like a rock and it is supposed to be<br/>\n&gt; crystal clear, great<br/>\n&gt; for nighttime viewing, but very cold!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We are all looking forward to this celebration<br/>\n&gt; together where we will<br/>\n&gt; share learning experiences, spiritual wisdom, a<br/>\n&gt; chance to commune<br/>\n&gt; with others in the peaceful setting provided at<br/>\n&gt; Woodland Altars.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh, and lest I forget, all of this is located in the<br/>\n&gt; middle of Amish<br/>\n&gt; country, so we have also studied a bit about the<br/>\n&gt; Amish culture and<br/>\n&gt; will visit one of the great Amish bakeries/bulk<br/>\n&gt; supply stores in the<br/>\n&gt; area. What a weekend!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here are some web sites about all the stuff we have<br/>\n&gt; on the <br/>\n&gt; smorgasbord for this weekend. Hopefully others will<br/>\n&gt; find time to <br/>\n&gt; watch the eclipse, since it will be relatively early<br/>\n&gt; in the evening, <br/>\n&gt; and find your own ways to celebrate the Harmonic<br/>\n&gt; Concordance, if that <br/>\n&gt; happens to appeal to you. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Harmonic Concordance:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.harmonicconcordance.com\">http://www.harmonicconcordance.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lunar Eclipse Observer&#39;s Kit:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.space.com/fullmoonfever/\">http://www.space.com/fullmoonfever/</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Superflares and Auroras:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.spaceweather.com/\">http://www.spaceweather.com/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://virtual.finland.fi/finfo/english/aurora_borealis.html\">http://virtual.finland.fi/finfo/english/aurora_borealis.html</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.exploratorium.edu/learning_studio/auroras/\">http://www.exploratorium.edu/learning_studio/auroras/</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Caves and Caving, and Seven Caves:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/caves/\">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/caves/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.showcaves.com/english/usa/showcaves/Seven.html\">http://www.showcaves.com/english/usa/showcaves/Seven.html</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ohwy.com/oh/s/sevencav.htm\">http://www.ohwy.com/oh/s/sevencav.htm</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ohwy.com/oh/s/sevencav.htm\">http://www.ohwy.com/oh/s/sevencav.htm</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Great Serpent Mound & Moundbuilders:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ohiohistory.org/places/serpent/\">http://www.ohiohistory.org/places/serpent/</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://greatserpentmound.org/\">http://greatserpentmound.org/</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nwoet.org/ohiotrek2/pdf/moundbuilders.pdf\">http://www.nwoet.org/ohiotrek2/pdf/moundbuilders.pdf</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Locust Grove and Crop Circles:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.fuse.net/ufo/formation2003.html\">http://home.fuse.net/ufo/formation2003.html</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.newsnet5.com/news/2460606/detail.html\">http://www.newsnet5.com/news/2460606/detail.html</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/mq7v\">http://tinyurl.com/mq7v</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.paradigmshift.com/theories.html\">http://www.paradigmshift.com/theories.html</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/elegant/everything.html\">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/elegant/everything.html</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ohio&#39;s Amish Communities:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amish-heartland.com/\">http://www.amish-heartland.com/</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.placesohio.com/amish_ohio.htm\">http://www.placesohio.com/amish_ohio.htm</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Woodland Altars & Mineral Springs Lake (cabins &<br/>\n&gt; camping):<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.woodlandaltars.org\">http://www.woodlandaltars.org</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mineralspringslake.com/\">http://www.mineralspringslake.com/</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Have a great weekend, everyone!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Norma<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!

Then<br/>\nwe have the huge coronal mass ejections that our sun has been hurling<br/>\nabout our solar system, making it highly probable that we will see<br/>\nthe aurora borealis if the skies remain clear.<br/>\n<br/>\nA bunch of homeschoolers, friends, and family here have arranged to<br/>\nvisit a beautiful nature preserve called Woodland Altars, run by the<br/>\nChurch of the Brethren (a Christian organization with a mission of<br/>\nPeace). We will take our field glasses and telescopes, musical<br/>\ninstruments, and stories to tell around the campfire circles Friday<br/>\nand Saturday nights. And we have arranged a bunch of other options,<br/>\nopportunities, for Saturday.  Some plan to just fish and commune with <br/>\nnature, sit around the campfire circles.  Others, like me, plan to <br/>\nvisit the many great sites in the area.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst we plan to visit Seven Caves, a great natural cave site. For<br/>\nthis we have been watching the NOVA series on caves, reading<br/>\nPlato&#39;s &quot;Allegory of the Cave,&quot; and studying the symbolism of the<br/>\nnumber seven in many spiritual teachings, from Buddhism, to the seven<br/>\nchakras. Then we will head over to Great Serpent Mound, the only<br/>\nNative American fetish serpent site known, made in the shape of a<br/>\nserpent uncoiling in seven deep curves. There&#39;s that number seven<br/>\nagain! For this visit we have been discussing Native American<br/>\nspirituality, the symbolism of the serpent in many different cultural <br/>\ntraditions, and the history of the Moundbuilders.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd lastly we are visiting the Locust Grove Crop Circle site, which<br/>\nis just across the road from Great Serpent Mound. For that we have<br/>\nbeen watching the NOVA series on &quot;String Theory,&quot; studying some basic<br/>\nquantum mechanics, discussing favorite science fiction and other <br/>\nreadings about alternative realities, reading theories about what <br/>\nmight have caused these different geometrically patterned circles all <br/>\naround the globe.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have also studied about eclipses, read about the Harmonic<br/>\nConcordance in science and several spiritual traditions, and studied<br/>\nabout the intense solar activity going on including the aurora<br/>\nborealis. Wow! What a weekend. Each night we will have campfire<br/>\ncircles for music and storytelling. We will set up our telescopes<br/>\nand observe the eclipse, hope to observe the aurora borealis, all in<br/>\na tranquil and beautiful setting at Woodland Altars.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterested home educators from all over the state, with friends and<br/>\nfamily, will gather for this weekend. Some of us are staying in nice<br/>\nwarm chalets we have rented. Others will bring their RVs. The very<br/>\nbrave will camp out. Brrrrrrrrr! Even though last week we saw<br/>\nrecord setting high temperatures here, this weekend the temperature<br/>\nhas fallen like a rock and it is supposed to be crystal clear, great<br/>\nfor nighttime viewing, but very cold!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are all looking forward to this celebration together where we will<br/>\nshare learning experiences, spiritual wisdom, a chance to commune<br/>\nwith others in the peaceful setting provided at Woodland Altars.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and lest I forget, all of this is located in the middle of Amish<br/>\ncountry, so we have also studied a bit about the Amish culture and<br/>\nwill visit one of the great Amish bakeries/bulk supply stores in the<br/>\narea. What a weekend!<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some web sites about all the stuff we have on the <br/>\nsmorgasbord for this weekend. Hopefully others will find time to <br/>\nwatch the eclipse, since it will be relatively early in the evening, <br/>\nand find your own ways to celebrate the Harmonic Concordance, if that <br/>\nhappens to appeal to you. <br/>\n<br/>\nHarmonic Concordance:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.harmonicconcordance.com\">http://www.harmonicconcordance.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLunar Eclipse Observer&#39;s Kit:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.space.com/fullmoonfever/\">http://www.space.com/fullmoonfever/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSuperflares and Auroras:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.spaceweather.com/\">http://www.spaceweather.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://virtual.finland.fi/finfo/english/aurora_borealis.html\">http://virtual.finland.fi/finfo/english/aurora_borealis.html</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.exploratorium.edu/learning_studio/auroras/\">http://www.exploratorium.edu/learning_studio/auroras/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nCaves and Caving, and Seven Caves:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/caves/\">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/caves/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.showcaves.com/english/usa/showcaves/Seven.html\">http://www.showcaves.com/english/usa/showcaves/Seven.html</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ohwy.com/oh/s/sevencav.htm\">http://www.ohwy.com/oh/s/sevencav.htm</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ohwy.com/oh/s/sevencav.htm\">http://www.ohwy.com/oh/s/sevencav.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nGreat Serpent Mound & Moundbuilders:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ohiohistory.org/places/serpent/\">http://www.ohiohistory.org/places/serpent/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://greatserpentmound.org/\">http://greatserpentmound.org/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nwoet.org/ohiotrek2/pdf/moundbuilders.pdf\">http://www.nwoet.org/ohiotrek2/pdf/moundbuilders.pdf</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLocust Grove and Crop Circles:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.fuse.net/ufo/formation2003.html\">http://home.fuse.net/ufo/formation2003.html</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.newsnet5.com/news/2460606/detail.html\">http://www.newsnet5.com/news/2460606/detail.html</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/mq7v\">http://tinyurl.com/mq7v</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.paradigmshift.com/theories.html\">http://www.paradigmshift.com/theories.html</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/elegant/everything.html\">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/elegant/everything.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOhio&#39;s Amish Communities:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amish-heartland.com/\">http://www.amish-heartland.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.placesohio.com/amish_ohio.htm\">http://www.placesohio.com/amish_ohio.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWoodland Altars & Mineral Springs Lake (cabins & camping):<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.woodlandaltars.org\">http://www.woodlandaltars.org</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mineralspringslake.com/\">http://www.mineralspringslake.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHave a great weekend, everyone!<br/>\n<br/>\nNorma</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17274,"nextTopicId":17283}}
