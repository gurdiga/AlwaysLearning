I just attended a talk <br/>\ngiven by Gordon Neufeld, who wrote Hold On To Your Kids, and he pointed out that a huge <br/>\nleap in development is evidenced by a child being able to experience and hold the <br/>\nawareness of conflicting emotions, and that all of the &quot;higher&quot; states such as compassion, <br/>\ncourage, etc. are the result of a conflict between caring and something else.

I posted a reply in which I described the<br/>\nthen exceedingly narrow range of foods my son preferred to eat and<br/>\nwrote that he was healthy anyway. I got a very stern email from one of<br/>\nthe group administrators telling me I&#39;d &quot;violated&quot; the TCS rule that<br/>\nwe don&#39;t talk about our children.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I wrote back to this woman, told her I thought &quot;violated&quot; was a<br/>\nmost extraordinary choice of word, and that, if she expected me to<br/>\ntalk about raising children in an abstract way without ever mentioning<br/>\nmy own children and their lives, I thought that idea sucked and I<br/>\nwasn&#39;t interested in being a member of the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m afraid I was rather rude to her, but there you go.

It&#39;d be hard not to.  He&#39;s a deep thinker, more intellectual than his parents.  When your kid&#39;s intelligence and maturity surpasses your own by the time he&#39;s talking, you pretty much have to take that seriously. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nI try not to coerce him and if I have been guilty of it (and I can&#39;t think when or if I was) he&#39;s been kind enough not to point it out or shame me about it.&lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve thought of coerce and manipulate as the same thing.  My mom was a great manipulator.  She used guilt to get us to do what she wanted us to do.  I&#39;ve tried hard not to do that.  So, I didn&#39;t say stuff like my mom would have said, &quot;It&#39;d be nice for you to rub your grandmothers feet.  You don&#39;t know how hard it is to be old but you&#39;ll find out someday....And cut her toenails too, you know she can&#39;t do it.    ( I once asked my brother to hit my hand with a big rock so I wouldn&#39;t be asked to trim yellow skyscraper old lady toenails.) (gag.) <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I have also assumed Dylan wanted to do good and helpful things so I never hesitated to ask him to grab a bag of groceries and carry it into the house.   We have the kind of relationship though, where I just wouldn&#39;t have asked if his hands were already full and he would have said if he couldn&#39;t do it for some reason and we&#39;d both be ok with that. <br/>\n<br/>\nI read some of the TCS stuff seven or eight years ago and found it mostly disgusting.

The stuff about assuming no one person&#39;s needs are greater than any other person&#39;s need bugs me.  My mom, who&#39;s had two hip replacements and who&#39;s losing some of her mobility for other reasons has a greater need to sit in the higher, firmer chair than anyone else.  So we hop out of that chair when she wants to sit.  Someone who&#39;s sick has a greater need to flop on the sofa than someone who&#39;s not sick so when the sicko comes into the room we move to a different spot.  That&#39;s ordinary courtesy and assuming kids don&#39;t want to or can&#39;t be courteous doesn&#39;t seem very respectful of kids.<br/>\n <br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re:Terms for parenting and unschooling","postDate":"1205644745","msgId":33118,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEEyMDE0NDQyLTZFMjUtNDExQS1BRUVELTIwRjM0RjBGOUJEQ0BtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZyaGVuZCtjMHQ5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZyaGVuZCtjMHQ5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":33117,"nextInTopic":33119,"prevInTime":33117,"nextInTime":33119,"topicId":33104,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"For the Taking Children Seriously people, coercion is defined as the psychological state of enacting one idea or impulse while a conflicting impulse is still","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1877094135\">For the Taking Children Seriously people, coercion is defined as &quot;the  <br/>\npsychological state of enacting one idea or impulse while a  <br/>\nconflicting impulse is still active in one&#39;s mind.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example of coercion would be me asking my daughter to turn down her  <br/>\nmusic and her doing it to be courteous and kind to me, while still  <br/>\nwishing she was listening to it loudly.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, that is simply my daughter being her gracious, generous self -  <br/>\nnot demanding her own way at all times.

I had a get-together of unschoolers at my house a<br/>\ncouple years ago. Most of us had never met each other in person, though some<br/>\nhad. A bunch of kids were in the pool with a couple of parents. I joined<br/>\nthem. I was playing with a couple of the kids and noticed that one boy was<br/>\nin the big blow-up ball where four people can get in. He wouldn&#39;t let in a<br/>\ngirl who was trying to get in. I saw his mom right there so I hung back,<br/>\nassuming she would help in some way. She watched with a smile and never said<br/>\na word, as the girl, who was shy, started quietly crying. The boy said<br/>\nthings like, &quot;You&#39;re not coming in! I don&#39;t like you!&quot; while the mom<br/>\ncontinued to watch and not say a word.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went over and said happily, &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; The girl quietly said she&#39;s<br/>\nbeen waiting a long time to get in and he won&#39;t let her in. I told the boy<br/>\nthat I noticed that my new friend here was looking upset and what was going<br/>\non with him and he said, &quot;I don&#39;t want her in here,&quot; and turned away. I<br/>\nmoved so that I was in front of him again and said, &quot;How come?&quot; He<br/>\nimmediately acted like I was a huge inconvenience. He didn&#39;t want to talk to<br/>\nme. I said, &quot;Are you wanting to be in there alone?&quot; He nodded, I think<br/>\nseeing that this was an easy way out. Then I said, &quot;I understand you want to<br/>\nbe in there alone, it&#39;s really fun! I had this big ball in the pool for<br/>\neveryone to share, so how much longer would you like to have in there before<br/>\nwe give someone else a turn?&quot; He didn&#39;t answer and turned away. I said,<br/>\n&quot;Well, I know Suzie&#39;s really wants a turn, so how does 5 more minutes<br/>\nsound?&quot; (he was 10 years old). He got out without a word. Had no interest in<br/>\nworking anything out. He clearly didn&#39;t want my presence there, didn&#39;t give<br/>\na hoot about the upset girl...just knew what he wanted and that was all that<br/>\nmattered. I pleasantly said to the girl, &quot;Looks like he&#39;s done! Do you want<br/>\nme to come in with you?&quot; And she said yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really had no intention of taking sides or setting up animosity...I&#39;m<br/>\nreally good at helping work things out so everyone&#39;s happy! I was so puzzled<br/>\nby the mother&#39;s lack of interaction and the child&#39;s lack of connection to<br/>\nanyone. I later learned the parents were libertarian. I didn&#39;t know anything<br/>\nabout libertarianism...still don&#39;t know much...not really an interest of<br/>\nmine, though now I&#39;ll be googling...and I certainly wouldn&#39;t box all<br/>\nlibertarians into one place, but your mention of this history suddenly<br/>\nbrought clarity to that whole situation.

Then the questions are, �What did you do to have a kid like<br/>\nthat?!� Another parent was concerned that because my kids don�t play to win<br/>\nthat they wouldn�t do well in �competition�.

Her father <br/>\nwas/still is a public school teacher.  We put her in a Montessori <br/>\nschool and then into a Quaker school which was still similar to the <br/>\nMontessori style.  I hated when he put her in public school for 3rd <br/>\ngrade.  He had just married another teacher with 2 kids in the p.s. <br/>\nsystem so Claire had to be treated like the others.  Then when my <br/>\nson (from 2nd marriage) was old enough for school, I was so unhappy <br/>\nand wanted to keep him home.  At that time, neither my DH nor I had <br/>\neven heard of homeschooling (this was in 2001).

That&#39;s not what has worked for the people I&#39;ve  <br/>\nrespected online and whose families I have met and been impressed by.<br/>\n<br/>\nYears ago there communications problems because people would say  <br/>\n&quot;unschooling&quot; about all manner of more lightly-structured   <br/>\nhomeschooling.  The arguments lessened when one group decided to call  <br/>\ntheirs &quot;eclectic homeschooling&quot; (because they felt they were using  <br/>\nsome unschooling and some structure, which some unschoolers  <br/>\nconsidered &quot;not unschooling&quot;).   Because I was coming from such an  <br/>\nattachment parenting background (the way we were living before we  <br/>\nthought about homeschooling at all), and because much of what I had  <br/>\ndiscovered about how children can learn and be peaceful came from our  <br/>\nfood freedoms and not having &quot;a bedtime,&quot; I called what I was doing  <br/>\n&quot;radical unschooling.&quot;  The term had been used before, some, meaning  <br/>\ntotally unschooling, even math and reading.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThese discussions were around 1985, I think?  (Others will remember  <br/>\nnumbers and dates better than I do.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThrough lots of daily untangling of what people thought unschooling  <br/>\nwas, the full-on academic unschooling got &quot;unschooling,&quot; the partial- <br/>\nkind-of-unschooling got &quot;eclectic&quot; and the also-includes-parenting  <br/>\ngot &quot;radical unschooling.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s my best recollection.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few years later there were a couple of people who were heavily  <br/>\ninvolved in NCP, &quot;non-coercive parenting,&quot; which came out of some [I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t know the terminology for it] kind of libertarians from the  <br/>\nU.K.   Their ideas had to do with arranging for kids to do whatever  <br/>\nkids wanted to do and to never coerce.  They considered persuasion to  <br/>\nbe coercion, it seemed.  Were they good parents?  Were their kids  <br/>\ndoing well?  None of our business; they wouldn&#39;t even say how old  <br/>\ntheir kids were.  It was top secret confidential information.  The  <br/>\nphilosophy should suffice; no proof was needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving come from La Leche League, where moms nurse babies in front of  <br/>\nother moms and you know the real names of those moms and babies, and  <br/>\nyou trusted the information because  you saw the proof all around  <br/>\nyou, and you saw the evidence of the failures, the only way I wanted  <br/>\nto share my stories was openly that way.  I was candid and  <br/>\nforthcoming about what had worked and had  not worked.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen NCP people showed up and criticized the fact that we were naming  <br/>\nour children in public, I was not at all inclined to feel ashamed.  I  <br/>\nwas also not inclined to help them spread a message they were  <br/>\nspreading on a wholly theoretical level.  Although a few people did  <br/>\ngo to their sites and pick up ideas they liked and used, to overlay  <br/>\nthat on the unschooling discussions that were already going on wasn&#39;t  <br/>\nhelpful.  They weren&#39;t going to mesh.<br/>\n<br/>\nI dug a magnet up in my yard the other day.  It was stuck to the  <br/>\nshovel. It was two inches long, and thick--half of an old ring  <br/>\nmagnet, and had probably been there thirty years.  It had lots of  <br/>\nlittle pieces of iron stuck to it--the iron that&#39;s just in the dirt  <br/>\nhere, where water has run, and our house was build where water used  <br/>\nto run.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter many years of the idea and the criticism of unschooling being  <br/>\nout in the discussions of the world, it has lots of little pieces of  <br/>\nother things stuck to it.  When critics describe unschooling they  <br/>\npour on the &quot;child-led learning&quot; (which might have come from &quot;child- <br/>\nled weaning, now that I&#39;m thinking of influences and cling-ons) and  <br/>\n&quot;non-coercive&quot; and other phrases that are particular to something,  <br/>\nbut which have baggage in the form of negative history and  <br/>\nunsupportable underpinnings.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":337544642,"authorName":"carnationsgalore","from":"&quot;carnationsgalore&quot; &lt;addled.homemaker@...&gt;","profile":"carnationsgalore","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Terms for parenting and unschooling","postDate":"1205589583","msgId":33104,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZyZ2tvZis2cnJmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":33105,"prevInTime":33103,"nextInTime":33105,"topicId":33104,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In one of my previous posts, I was looking for a word to describe my parenting style and said noncoercive parenting.
