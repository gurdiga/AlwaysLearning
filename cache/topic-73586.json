My oldest is a big nose picker (actually picker and eater). It grosses me out a bit, but I know it&#39;s a pretty normal thing, so I&#39;ve worked on relaxing around it. He has suffered from several bouts of impetigo around his nose and mouth which the doctor explained is from his habit. For a long while I tried to get him to stop, but he seemed to become anxious and embarrassed around it, so I stopped about six months ago. \n\nI am finding myself unhappy with the nose picking again, mainly when I see him picking his nose and using the family computer (or iPad, or my phone...things that we all touch and I&#39;d rather not directly be touching someone else&#39;s snot). It *really* bugs the other adults in the house. I have asked him to wash his hands before using the computer, and he will if I remind him, but then his finger is up his nose again within minutes. His brother has now started as well, and I can feel tension building inside of me around it again. \n\nHe has told me that it&#39;s just a habit, that he doesn&#39;t think about it. I have offered kleenexes when I see him picking, I even convinced him to try rinsing his nose everyday (which really helped) but he HATED it so quickly stopped. \n\nHow can I approach this in a way that reduces everyone&#39;s stress around it?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":73640,"nextTopicId":73630}}
