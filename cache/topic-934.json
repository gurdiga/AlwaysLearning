We removed the fireplace screen, set out <br/>\ncookies and milk, lit the tree, etc. The place looked exactly like the house <br/>\non Xmas eve. With the video camera on, we taped &quot;Santa&quot; as he backed out of <br/>\nthe fireplace with his bag. He put all the presents under the <br/>\ntree---including the new bike, stuffed the stockings, ate his cookies and <br/>\ndrank his milk, and hung candy canes on the tree.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe clean up from that was far worse than the cleanup Christmas morning!<br/>\n<br/>\nChristmas eve, after we removed the screen, set out the milk and cookies, <br/>\netc. AGAIN, my husband had the &quot;really neat idea&quot; to set up the video camera <br/>\nto &quot;catch Santa in the act&quot;. Cameron was SOOOO excited to see the film the n<br/>\next morning: he had PROOF that there was a Santa for YEARS even when his <br/>\nfriends insisted there wasn&#39;t. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was teribbly worried about the &quot;truth&quot; when he got older. But by then, he <br/>\nhad a younger brother (8 years apart) and was willing to &quot;play Santa&quot; for <br/>\nhim. So the let-down wasn&#39;t bad. There had been MUCH talk of fantasy and <br/>\nfairy tales and spirits up to that point too---it was kind of a natural <br/>\ngrowing-up progression.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Santa&quot; was here today for a party for the 5-6 year olds. Cameron was <br/>\nexcited, as an almost 14 year old, to see Hal and they talked a while about <br/>\nthe film and how many parties Hal has left before Christmas.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also celebrate Nicholas Day on the 6th (since Cameron was born in <br/>\nGermany)---and he fills shoes with candy and fruit and nuts.

There&#39;s a lot of fantastic stuff that happens <br/>\neveryday; we just really go crazy on a holiday. I can&#39;t speak for Duncan (5), <br/>\nbut Cameron has always loved the idea of Santa.

Some of my little friends say there is no <br/>\nSanta Claus. Papa says, &quot;If you see it in The Sun, it&#39;s so.&quot; Please <br/>\ntell me the truth, is there a Santa Claus?<br/>\n<br/>\n      Virginia O&#39;Hanlon<br/>\n<br/>\nVirginia, your little friends are wrong. They have been affected by <br/>\nthe skepticism of a skeptical age. They do not believe except they <br/>\nsee. They think that nothing can be which is not comprehensible by <br/>\ntheir little minds. All minds, Virginia, whether they be men&#39;s or <br/>\nchildren&#39;s, are little. In this great universe of ours, man is a mere <br/>\ninsect, an ant, in his intellect as compared with the boundless world <br/>\nabout him, as measured by the intelligence capable of grasping the <br/>\nwhole of truth and knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as certainly as love <br/>\nand generosity and devotion exist, and you know that they abound and <br/>\ngive to your life its highest beauty and joy. Alas! how dreary would <br/>\nbe the world if there were no Santa Claus! It would be as dreary as <br/>\nif there were no Virginias. There would be no childlike faith then, <br/>\nno poetry, no romance to make tolerable this existence. We should <br/>\nhave no enjoyment, except in sense and sight. The external light with <br/>\nwhich childhood fills the world would be extinguished.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot believe in Santa Claus! You might as well not believe in fairies. <br/>\nYou might get your papa to hire men to watch in all the chimneys on <br/>\nChristmas eve to catch Santa Claus, but even if you did not see Santa <br/>\nClaus coming down, what would that prove? Nobody sees Santa Claus, <br/>\nbut that is no sign that there is no Santa Claus. The most real <br/>\nthings in the world are those that neither children nor men can see. <br/>\nDid you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn? Of course not, but <br/>\nthat&#39;s no proof that they are not there. Nobody can conceive or <br/>\nimagine all the wonders there are unseen and unseeable in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou tear apart the baby&#39;s rattle and see what makes the noise inside, <br/>\nbut there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the strongest <br/>\nman, nor even the united strength of all the strongest men that ever <br/>\nlived could tear apart. Only faith, poetry, love, romance, can push <br/>\naside that curtain and view and picture the supernal beauty and glory <br/>\nbeyond. Is it all real? Ah, Virginia, in all this world there is <br/>\nnothing else real and abiding.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo Santa Claus! Thank God! he lives and lives forever. A thousand <br/>\nyears from now, Virginia, nay 10 times 10,000 years from now, he will <br/>\ncontinue to make glad the heart of childhood.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523757,"authorName":"Pam Hartley","from":"Pam Hartley &lt;pamhartley@...&gt;","profile":"pdhartley2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Santa and unschooling","postDate":"1008735349","msgId":936,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBHT0swMEEyWlA2RUNZQG10YTYuc25mYzIxLnBiaS5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":934,"nextInTopic":937,"prevInTime":935,"nextInTime":937,"topicId":934,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Mine are 7 and 4 and believe.
