As I sit typing on my computer I hear the Lego<br/>\nRacers tune coming from Zak&#39;s.  He&#39;s so happy that we&#39;ve decided to let him<br/>\nplay as much as he wants....Unfortunately or fortunately he knows about Lego<br/>\nRacers II and that&#39;s why he&#39;s working on conquering this one so that he can<br/>\nhave the next one.... Yes I have tried it and I cannot master it.... I<br/>\nalways seem to end up with the &#39;WRONG WAY&#39; sign showing up when I play<br/>\nit..... I just went and played a game with him and even with him using the<br/>\njoystick (which we&#39;ve only just brought) he still beat me easily....<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\nI usually do not respond but I had to let you know that we share a very<br/>\ncommon experience. My son is also 6 and was pretty much just like your son<br/>\nbefore and after he received Lego Racer. He would wake up at 4:00am with<br/>\nthat game on his mind and play for hours on end. It took him about 2 months<br/>\nto completely master it and these days he has moved on and rarely do I hear<br/>\nthat little lego racer tune coming from the computer room. By the way, have<br/>\nyou ever tried to play it yourself? I have a very difficult time just<br/>\nstaying on the track. My opinion is do not interfere because he is being<br/>\nchallenged, that is what makes it so fun. Just let him get it out of his<br/>\nsystem and then he will move on like my son has. After all once you win<br/>\nfirst place every time it becomes a little boring. Oh-yeah, look out there<br/>\nis also a Lego Racer ll.<br/>\n<br/>\nNic<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n********************<br/>\nDawn  Falbe<br/>\nAstrologer Coach<br/>\n(520) 312-5300<br/>\n********************<br/>\nwww.astrologerdawn.com<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dawn@...\">dawn@...</a><br/>\nEnlightening you on how to discover and live your Soul Purpose<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The people who get on in this world are people who get up and look for the<br/>\ncircumstances they want, and, if they can&#39;t find them, make them.&quot; - George<br/>\nBernard Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The only time my education was interrupted was when I was in school&quot; -<br/>\nGeorge Bernard Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2542,"nextTopicId":2546}}
