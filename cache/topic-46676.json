His latest special interest is Transformers and claymation.  He<br/>\nhopes one day to be a director of sci-fi movies.  He produced this<br/>\nstop-action claymation video despite technical difficulties such as his<br/>\nmother dragging her feet on driving him to the store to get the clay. He<br/>\naccomplished the whole thing without any intervention on my part save the<br/>\ndrive to the craft store. My first time seeing the film was when I received<br/>\nan e-mail from him with the YouTube link.  How affirming it is to see what a<br/>\nchild can accomplish when he is allowed to run with his passion.  He is<br/>\ncompletely self-taught and this is his first attempt at claymation.  We<br/>\nstarted homeschooling (unschooling) less than a year ago.  It crossed my<br/>\nmind that he was possibly just playing video games all day, but decided to<br/>\ntrust that even if that were true there was learning taking place.  I&#39;m very<br/>\nexcited for him that he is pursuing his gift and being affirmed in it.  So,<br/>\nhere is my shameless plea for you to click on the link below, then watch and<br/>\nvote for finalist #3.  That&#39;s my boy!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mark-ryan.blogspot.com/2009/08/behold-glory-of-finalists.html\">http://mark-ryan.blogspot.com/2009/08/behold-glory-of-finalists.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve already voted a sincere ThankYou!!!!!
