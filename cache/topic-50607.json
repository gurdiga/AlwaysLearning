I read much of it. One or two people wrote, more than once, about being rejected, outcast, or some version of that.  For some people everything is personal. <br/>\n<br/>\nI asked a woman I know who is recently divorced what kinds of things comforted her and she said she was comforted when people said her ex husband was an asshole.  There are people who don’t want to think beyond what they feel.  I suppose very few of those kinds of people will ever feel comfortable on a discussion list or forum. <br/>\n<br/>\nI made the mistake of complaining on a friend’s wall at Facebook. (An in person life long friend.)  I don’t usually complain, it was a moment of weakness.&lt;g&gt; I was frustrated about a problem with my mother. People I didn’t know, who have never met me and who could not possibly know what kind of person I am, posted messages of “support.”  “You’re such a good daughter.”   It made me feel a little sick.  I pointed out that they couldn’t know what kind of daughter I was, that the reason my mother was agitated might be because I was poking her with pins.  The “support” kept coming.  It was a good reminder for me, a fresh appreciation for clear thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don’t know what all makes a person want that kind of thing. Lots of insecurity, lots of need, a dose of delusion.   I’m glad Joyce finds it intriguing and is willing to try to explain, again and again, the difference between help and support. My strong inclination to say “Use your fucking brain!” would rightly be considered wrong. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nKaren James wrote a lovely post at that discussion about AlwaysLearning.  I wish I’d saved it.  She compared her family life to a work of art, unschooling to her paintbrush, and said she shares her picture and welcomes ideas on how to make it better.

On the Yahoo groups, there&#39;s far, far less acrimony than their used to be. Some of that is no doubt due to lower volume - but the lower volume is also due to the fact that there&#39;s less drama. I was seeing the drama step down before facebook took off, as list owners and moderators started to learn how to keep things more peaceful - it took some time! A lot of the drama has moved to facebook and I expect to see the same sort of process there - over time page owners will figure out how to create more peaceful spaces. It might happen faster - it certainly will on some pages because people are starting out with more skills from years (decades now) of online communication so the learning curve is shorter and more specific to the network rather than the overall concept of online group discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&quot;But maybe those places should be more upfront with what they are about. I know some have info and rules posted but obviously they are not clear enough about it&quot;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***********<br/>\n<br/>\nI was amazed and fascinated when Sandra first changed the home page on Always Learning to begin with the words &quot;do not post&quot; in all caps. That to people who say the list needs a warning label! I&#39;ve been watching to see if it changes anything, and I don&#39;t think it does (although I may do something similar on Unschooling Basics, just for the &quot;so there&quot; factor). What keeps down the level of drama is moderators refusing to engage in drama and shutting people down when they get hostile. There are venues where people get mean and bully others - every one I&#39;ve seen so far has had an &quot;inclusive&quot; policy and no moderation beyond a spam filter. The groups and lists which have grown less &quot;inclusive&quot; over the years have also seen a significant drop in the sort of &quot;mob behavior&quot; which whips up on the &quot;inclusive&quot; groups. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn face to face groups, there&#39;s also a difference between &quot;inclusive&quot; groups versus groups with a specific focus, although it&#39;s not quite the same as online. I put inclusive in quotes because it&#39;s really a misnomer - it&#39;s a stated goal but one which isn&#39;t ever achieved because the very nature of an &quot;inclusive&quot; group leaves some people feeling unsafe, disengranchised, shut out, bullied, silenced. I&#39;m generally not comfortable in &quot;inclusive&quot; groups - I&#39;m almost always the odd-ball and &quot;inclusive&quot; groups favor people who fit in. So I&#39;d rather be in a specific group where the &quot;fitting in&quot; part is obvious - the group exists for people who all fit within certain parameters. That&#39;s why radical unschooling discussions exist at all - because so many of us have had That experience with &quot;inclusive&quot; homeschooling groups which don&#39;t actually include us at all. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Support","postDate":"1361715746","msgId":70645,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNEN0FFNUNFLTIzOTAtNDkyQy04NTg2LTMyNjFCRkE1RUZBM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBRWhNejVLK0QxV2RvVV8xRVU4NUFqZlBMZzdBbVY0bnByOW1EdWdWZ2Z3VWMrX0tOQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDg2NzJFREI4LTREMUYtNDk2NC05RkI0LTE2ODBEMTA4MkU5MEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4gPGtnYnJydCs0YW9uQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MTM2MTY4ODQ1Ni4zNTE5Ny5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViMTIwOTA2Lm1haWwubmUxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPENBRWhNejVLcHhEZGFXTTZDRG5RPTJ5QVBQejMzd1IyMkF3bjV6ZnpMS2l0MHdXVnE9Z0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPENBRWhNejVLK0QxV2RvVV8xRVU4NUFqZlBMZzdBbVY0bnByOW1EdWdWZ2Z3VWMrX0tOQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":70641,"nextInTopic":70646,"prevInTime":70644,"nextInTime":70646,"topicId":50607,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-*These employees are at high risk of being fired.

I had a lot of questions for her because I had been reading about natural childbirth and the barriers that hospitalization and modern medicine place in the way. Her answers horrified me - she basically said every single thing that was a red flag in the Bradley (and related) literature. I was shaking and almost crying when we left the office.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we got outside, James turned to me with a huge smile and said, &quot;That was great!&quot; He had heard nothing to distress him.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven when we focus on absolute clarity and simple language, there are misunderstandings. People have different reactions to the same stories, not always what the storyteller might intend. Sometimes people seem willfully blind - that&#39;s cognitive dissonance at work I guess. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo now there is all this stuff on Facebook. People talking about hard liners and &quot;bullies&quot; and complaining about the definition of unschooling being rigidly defined.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople grumping about being advised to read more information. People who claim not to be new, complaining on behalf of people who actually ARE new.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople wanting credit for being unschoolers, for living unschooling, and describing their unschooling lives - which sound nice, of course. (But at the same time claiming that labels don&#39;t matter, they don&#39;t care about the label of &quot;unschooler&quot;.)<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople determinedly assert that they know all about unschooling, they&#39;ve been reading at all the sites, on all the lists, in all the groups, that they fully understand how unschooling works, they know all about what is discussed here - what has been said repeatedly over the years. That nevertheless they disagree with how unschooling is defined.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen they blog things like this about those other Radical Unschoolers:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;They want their child to be able to make choices, discover circumstances, and come to conclusions completely on their own.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo all the reading, all the discussions, all the posts, all the YEARS of archives, and still some people come to the conclusion that what we espouse is the *exact opposite* of everything that is said and elucidated here.

I try to do my bit, but my magazine isn&#39;t free; people shouldn&#39;t have to spend money in order not to be bullied or abused.\u2028&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, saying it&#39;s bullying and abuse to try to keep a discussion positive and on topic is, well, bullying and abuse.  Someone who&#39;s not IN any of the philosophical discussions and never has been, but who has been selling magazines (not always successfully) is telling anyone who will listen that if support is to be given, it must be offered equally to all, to welcome all people into the &quot;community.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf all are in a community, it&#39;s not a community anymore.  If this discussion welcomed everyone equally, regardless of their beliefs or posting habits, then what would be the difference between in here and nothing at all? Or between in here and the comments on a youtube video?  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat argument on facebook (which I was not in) started (by its own admission) over frustration about an unschooling discussion that was unmoderated.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have no idea what that lack of moderation brought about.  But the same discussion went from dismay at lack of moderation to dismay at the effects of moderation.   Maybe at that point I should&#39;ve stopped reading, but it seemed so much to be about me and this particular group that I wanted to see how it ended. :-)   [It won&#39;t ever end, really.]<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we can be made to look ogre-esque, it might bring some magazine subscriptions, I guess.  And the magazine says free help is from ogres, and that nobody knows more about unschooling than anyone else, and (it&#39;s going to say, says that source) that &quot;radical unschooling&quot; is redundant (meaning that all unschooling is radical, politically, I&#39;m guessing it will say).  And the way to stay a part of that group is to keep paying the subscription price.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like magazines.  I don&#39;t like for magazine editors to tell others (falsely) what it is I&#39;m doing, and then tell people I shouldn&#39;t be doing it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI like paper magazines.  I don&#39;t like online magazines.  If people are going to wait two or three months to read something that was already written and could have been available electronically earlier, it seems like an impediment to the flow of information, rather than a conduit worth paying for.    But some people want the convenience of pre-chosen information.  I suppose that makes sense, too.

They want that feeling of &quot;I&#39;ve found people who understand and accept me!&quot; It&#39;s something they can&#39;t find in their face to face life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason people share the bad stories is because genetically we&#39;re social creatures. We draw strength from being connected to each other. When someone&#39;s suffering, they need extra strength. When someone&#39;s happy, they don&#39;t. So, biologically, we respond -- we connect -- when there&#39;s suffering in order to support. It&#39;s what draws people together when they all suffer a disaster together.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re waiting with a stranger and she sighs out, &quot;My daughter dumped out an entire gallon of milk on the floor this morning,&quot; you&#39;re likely to feel a connection. Even if your child never did exactly that you can relate to what she&#39;s feeling, relate to what she went through.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, instead, she says, &quot;My 4 year old daughter made me a cup of tea today. It was so cute! Of course she spilled half of it carrying it to me, but it was so thoughtful of her!&quot; It might make you smile. You might carry that image with you for a while. But it doesn&#39;t feel connecting. Even though most of us have felt that happiness at something delightful. It doesn&#39;t connect us. Someone might even think, &quot;My kid never does stuff like that.&quot; Or, &quot;My kid shaved the cat this morning.&quot; ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people share their troubles they don&#39;t *necessarily* want solutions. They want connection. They want to be re-energized by people understanding, by feeling others have gone through this too. Our kids come to us when they&#39;re suffering. It&#39;s instinctual. It&#39;s a biological need. So that need in humans to connect when we&#39;re struggling will always be there, will always draw people together.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT just because it&#39;s instinct doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the best solution! The problem with connecting through suffering is that if you stop suffering then you&#39;re disconnecting from the group. To remain connected you need to keep suffering or relating to the suffering. Connecting through suffering is good for a recharge. It&#39;s not a good solution in the long run. But to do better is to lose your group!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd people *do* find that&#39;s true. Someone said she had joined a support group for moms of Aspergers kids (I think it was). At first it was wonderful finding all these people who knew what she was going through. But the longer she stayed the more she realized the support was to sustain each other in what they were going through, not support in doing better. To do better would take away what they all shared. It would take away what allowed new mothers to feel that instant connection.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis group -- and other analysis-of-unschooling-ideas groups -- is more like a common interest group. It has more in common with a truck repair group than it does with a mom support group. The truck repair group focuses on exchanging ideas and growing understanding. They connect through that shared interest. The mom support group is about supporting each other through shared difficulties. If they help someone do better they&#39;re sabotaging what holds the group together!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like every caring mother should want to put *deliberate effort* into doing better (rather than just fixing problems as they arise). But I think there are two main reasons they don&#39;t.

What is it that creates so much negativity about a person or group sharing their hard-earned knowledge, experience and time (for free, too!)? Do you think maybe it&#39;s because they want easy solutions, everything packaged all nice and pretty on the surface? But if they&#39;re challenged to get beyond that and go deeper, it seems some prefer to lash out and say you&#39;re too mean.

Or be positive - sending an uplifting message instead. To say the least, I&#39;m still baffled. Being straightforward, honest and encouraging families to not unschool in a mediocre way is not nasty. Nasty would be only responding with platitudes when parents are obviously struggling to get it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be honest, the other unschooling groups I&#39;ve joined on facebook don&#39;t offer much. Maybe a good meme to share once in a while. So much of what&#39;s said is focused on why public school is bad. Why government is bad. Why it&#39;s okay to slip up once in a while and be mean to your kid. When they do share something actually pertaining to unschooling, they often make it sound like all one has to do is pull your kid out of school, deschool, and life is easy-peasy.

Only one of them is one I can say is doing so up to the standard shared here. We spend as much time with them as we can. Fortunately their son is my son&#39;s favorite friend. Which doesn&#39;t surprise me - he&#39;s a lucky kid with an amazing, joyful, imaginative family life, and he reflects that back to the world.

One couple I think won&#39;t regret it as much as the other will.  At least one, though, I think will be sorry soon, as they see that things aren&#39;t better.  Their kids are in school already.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe third stayed together.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI wish all three had, at least for a while longer, tried other tactics, and to put their children ahead of their anger and personal problems.  They could have changed some attitudes and actions and many things would have changed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s good when someone does better in a new relationship, after a separation or divorce.  If one can see what went wrong and then avoid what contributed to the problems, that&#39;s great.  But when someone decides to blame the other partner for all of it, entirely, it&#39;s the recipe for a re-run. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know some people who have been married three or four times, with similar problems each time.  From the point of view of the kids, if the problems are the same all the time, it would be better for the problem guy to be their dad than stepdad #2 or #3.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen someone has divorced and it wasn&#39;t something they could find a way to avoid, it&#39;s sad, of course, but if they want to discuss it at length and justify it, an unschooling discussion isn&#39;t a good place for it.    They might still be able to unschool, depending on the ex, the grandparents, new partners, judges, social workers (depending how many eventually get involved).  If it&#39;s not an unschooling situation in the first place, then it has little to nothing to do with this discussion at all, unless it&#39;s about one of the parents here having been harmed by a divorce.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we can take from our lives that helps us move toward more peace is good.<br/>\nWhat is brought here that would encourage negative reactions or behaviors is probably going to be questioned, in light of what helps unschooling work well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI want to support children&#39;s happiness.<br/>\nI want to support knowledge of unschooling, rather than the details of any one family.<br/>\nI want to create an environment in which learning about unschooling can flourish. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Support","postDate":"1361559128","msgId":70601,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNjE1NTkxMjguNjE0NDcuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE4MjIwMy5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNjE1NTgwMTUuMzgwNDYuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE4MjIwMy5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDYzMDk0QTY3LTgyOTEtNEM3Qy1BNkY5LTQ2QjUwRTBBOTQ0OUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDEzNjE1NTgwMTUuMzgwNDYuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE4MjIwMy5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":70597,"nextInTopic":70602,"prevInTime":70600,"nextInTime":70602,"topicId":50607,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"    I meant to say that : ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1641370439\">&lt;&lt;I have been in supportive unschooling groups where everything that was written was  not really challenged or taken as valid.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n I meant to say that :<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been in supportive unschooling groups where everything that was written was not really challenged and that everything was taken as valid.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Support","postDate":"1361558015","msgId":70597,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNjE1NTgwMTUuMzgwNDYuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE4MjIwMy5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDYzMDk0QTY3LTgyOTEtNEM3Qy1BNkY5LTQ2QjUwRTBBOTQ0OUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDYzMDk0QTY3LTgyOTEtNEM3Qy1BNkY5LTQ2QjUwRTBBOTQ0OUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":70595,"nextInTopic":70601,"prevInTime":70596,"nextInTime":70598,"topicId":50607,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sandra I have been in supportive unschooling groups where everything that was written was  not really challenged or taken as valid.
