Sometimes that learning is more effective when experienced rather than read about.  I&#39;m a sahm to dd Sami 6yrs and ds Xander, 3 in April.  We always planned to homeschool and I liked what I&#39;ve read about unschooling (life learning).  About a year ago I purchased a second hand Oak Meadow curriculum for K thinking that I should at least look at some kind of curriculum and that one appealed to me the best.  That thing is still sitting in my &quot;to read&quot; pile and we&#39;ve been doing our own thing which involves no structure though I do try and keep some kind of rhythm.<br/>\nWe have four fire signs living in this house which gets interesting.  This afternoon Sami and I were butting heads about a few things.  I got a little frustrated that she wouldn&#39;t listen to me about anything even though I was trying to show her an easy solution to some frustration that she was experiencing.  I said &quot;why won&#39;t you let me help you?  This (meaning learning at home) is not going to work if you won&#39;t let me help you learn things.&quot;  She declared most strongly &quot;this IS working...I KNOW it is..it&#39;s MY way..My secret&quot;.   I was the one learning a lesson about letting go and letting her find her way and helping when asked.  A little later she said to me &quot;Mum, I know a lot of things...letters, numbers, colours and shapes...but the most important thing is this..&quot; ..and she hugged me.  Another wonderful lesson from a very wise old soul.  How lucky am I?!!<br/>\n~ Annette <br/>\n(Aussie gal stuck in the US desert)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSimplicity cannot be attained by striving, but only by letting go.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
