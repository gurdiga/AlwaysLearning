We did just join a Unitarian <br/>\nUniversalist &quot;church&quot; a couple of weeks ago and today she had her <br/>\nfirst &quot;Sunday School&quot; where they will be learning about all the <br/>\nreligions of the world.  She enjoyed it and I&#39;m hoping that this <br/>\nclassroom environment will be all she needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nLauren is very different from me.  I&#39;m a very unstructured soul, <br/>\nperhaps because my childhood took place in an overly structured <br/>\nenvironment.  When we&#39;re in a hurry, I have to stop Lauren from <br/>\ncleaning her room and making her bed.  Her shoes are all perfectly <br/>\npositioned in her closet and there is NEVER a mess on the floor.  She <br/>\neven begs me for a bed time.  I tell her she can go to bed whenever <br/>\nshe wants, but she won&#39;t go without her sister who does not want a <br/>\nbed time.  Sounds like she&#39;s dying for some kind of structure which <br/>\nis very difficult for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the next question is:  When a child seems to want structure but <br/>\nthen rejects it, what do you do?  She&#39;s asking for homeschooling <br/>\nlessons from her reading workbook (her idea, not mine), but then when <br/>\nI suggest doing it for a half hour in the mornings, she&#39;s never in <br/>\nthe mood.
