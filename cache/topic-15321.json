Hope to see you at the park this week!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Pam (and Joylyn),<br/>\n<br/>\nI am going to try to make it to the park.  I think I can find it, but<br/>\nwhere might I find you guys in the park?  Is it large? I&#39;ve been to<br/>\nseveral park days in the past in my last area, and found out after that<br/>\nthere were actually others, but we didn&#39;t recognize each other.  Any<br/>\nhelp?  I&#39;ll be there with a 7 year old boy (dark hair, probably a<br/>\nbaseball cap) and a 13 year old girl - long medium brown hair and<br/>\nglasses and probably wearing a red plaid flannel shirt (about 75% of the<br/>\ntime) or a long dark grey cape.  lol.  If Lexie is there, I&#39;ll be able<br/>\nto find you.  I know her from South Orange County park days.  I&#39;ve never<br/>\nmet Joylyn, but have met her husband and daughters. Thanks!  <br/>\n<br/>\n~Alyce</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15169,"nextTopicId":15322}}
