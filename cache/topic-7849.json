I have two <br/>\nparts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI play Lucetta (a maid to one of the love interests) and my costume is a long <br/>\nsleeved underdress made from a very tight-weave cotton/poly and an overdress <br/>\n(some name that starts with a &quot;t&quot;) that is a lovely sage green but looks like <br/>\nit used to be bedroom drapes. Also tights, slippers and a head covering in <br/>\n&quot;snood&quot; fashion. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also play Thurio (as I call him, &quot; the sleazy suitor&quot;).  He is not written <br/>\nas a flaming queen, but that&#39;s the way he&#39;s chosen to reveal himself this <br/>\ntime.  The costume is black, above-the-knee pants (with the same tights and <br/>\nslippers from Lucetta), a purple doublet with double sleeves (cut-outs you <br/>\nknow), a purple cape, a lacy ruff and cuffs, black velvet hat with plume and <br/>\na belt with sword and purple velvet purse.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe additional challenge is that during Act I (i.e. before intermission, not <br/>\naccording to the script) I must go from Lucetta to Thurio and back to <br/>\nLucetta.  Act II is only Thurio.  Tis interesting and very fun.  The cast is <br/>\ntight and we had a blast on Wed. when we just danced around the stage to the <br/>\npre-show and intermission music (which is cheatin&#39; songs from the 50&#39;s-80&#39;s <br/>\ncountry, pop, rock, easy listening).  Of course, that rehearsal ran 5 hours, <br/>\nbut at least it was fun in the beginning.<br/>\n<br/>\nWill let you know how it goes.  Curtain is in 4 hours!<br/>\n<br/>\nDiAnna</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7848,"nextTopicId":7841}}
