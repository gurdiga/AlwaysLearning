The catch is that things that are new to the brain are what cause this process to happen.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe downside, I believe, is that we can get locked into ways of thinking that we want to change--like ruts in a road.  For example, we have to break it up and form new connections when we learn something new, like unschooling.  But then the process of &quot;really getting it&quot; will be expressed in our brains with heavier pathways of myelination--when we can function on autopilot in making new and better choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think less myelination just means that mentors are useful--but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s any different for teens than it is for adults.  I look for mentors when I want to learn something new.  I think this &quot;science&quot; might be a case for teens getting out into the real world where they can seek out the mentors they want and create the myelination patterns that will be useful in their/our lives--NOT for locking them up with teachers with each other and being infanticized.

I am watching that ability -- to consider another person&#39;s point of view -- develop in my children.***<br/>\n<br/>\nRight, really young children go through that.  My youngest is 8 and is just really beginning to understand that.  My oldest seemed to get it much earlier, closer to the age of 4 or 5.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been all kinds of studies on the human brain, children&#39;s brains, teenage brains, young adult, old folks, etc.  The thing about all the studies that I&#39;ve seen or heard about that involve the teenage brain, is that there is this underlying idea that something is &quot;wrong&quot; with their brains and they are attempting to discover why.  If you don&#39;t accept that there is something wrong with a teenager&#39;s brain to begin with, the studies come off as a little askew.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSure, a young person&#39;s brain is different.  I suspect that one of the main differences is the biological focus on human reproduction has a huge part to do with why a young person&#39;s brain is different than a middle aged person&#39;s brain.  Every thing a young person does, has to do with human reproduction, the self discovery, the grooming practices, the social networking, all of that is designed to connect with other humans.<br/>\n<br/>\nA middle aged person&#39;s brain is much more focused on preservation.  Since the focuses are so very different it would naturally follow that their brains are different, are making different connections.  Neither is better than the other, the stages a person&#39;s brain goes through, is necessary to how humans survive.<br/>\n<br/>\nScapegoating a teenagers brain, to come up with conclusions as to why they do &quot;dumb&quot; things, leaves little understanding of why people&#39;s brains DO do what they do.  The correlation of doing &quot;dumb&quot; things could be a symptom of other things entirely, like the given environment that the individual is reacting and responding to.  Since most teenagers in our culture are in environments that are almost entirely controlled by others, it seems like there is much more of an environmental factor that should be considered when examining their brain functions.  It&#39;s this missing element that I most object to.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":294520986,"authorName":"Joanna","from":"&quot;Joanna&quot; &lt;ridingmom@...&gt;","profile":"ridingmom1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: feedback on articles about teens?","postDate":"1267641958","msgId":51346,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhtbWFwNis5NWFlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNCNkYzMzE0MzYxRTQxQjhBRDQ3QkVEMkJBQTkyNjRGQExZTEFMQVAyPg=="},"prevInTopic":51344,"nextInTopic":51351,"prevInTime":51345,"nextInTime":51347,"topicId":51233,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Here&#39;s the thing for me.... My parents felt it was good and necessary to go to school and get a diploma, yet they weren&#39;t unkind and forceful and shaming like most of the parents that I&#39;ve met.  So, while I can forgive parents who think that it&#39;s perfectly right and normal to send their kids off to school, I find it harder to forgive parents who are just plain mean about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really don&#39;t understand the dismissive behavior of parents towards teenagers.  It just feels wrong to me on so many levels.  Finding &quot;scientific&quot; data to promote that division of teenagers and adults plays right into that.  I&#39;d rather see teenagers as people, since they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, even though I don&#39;t like what schools do and how parents buy into it, I do have friends with kids in school, who ARE nice to their kids and don&#39;t buy into this kind of scientific data.  It was clear from the article that the mom must have done something right, even though she was promoting this data, since her son is still willing to talk to her and be a part of her life!  The comments though, are another story entirely... lots of really rude and ignorant parents there, reading that and justifying their rudeness!<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185586397,"authorName":"Lyla Wolfenstein","from":"&quot;Lyla Wolfenstein&quot; &lt;lylaw@...&gt;","profile":"lylawolf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] feedback on articles about teens?","postDate":"1267553140","msgId":51275,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk0NUFBQzdEQkZGQTRCNzk4OTY1QUMyNjMwMDgxQTEzQExZTEFMQVAyPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNDRUE1NjEyLTZFRUEtNDEyMS1BM0E4LUMwQTY4MTVCMzA4REBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwM0ZDMDNENzIxNjRDREJBQzVGOUM3NzVFMjFGQjg3QExZTEFMQVAyPiA8Njk3NzIuMTAwOTEucW1Ad2ViMTEwNDA3Lm1haWwuZ3ExLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDM1REI0OTZCMEE4RDQyMjBBRjhDREI5Mjk1REZCRDQ1QExZTEFMQVAyPiA8M0NFQTU2MTItNkVFQS00MTIxLUEzQTgtQzBBNjgxNUIzMDhEQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":51245,"nextInTopic":51296,"prevInTime":51274,"nextInTime":51276,"topicId":51233,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"++++++++ But if, as so many people believe, school is a natural part of life, then schooled-teen-behavior is natural If homework is inevitable, then the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-840622512\">++++++++<br/>\nBut if, as so many people believe, school is a natural part of life, <br/>\nthen schooled-teen-behavior is natural<br/>\nIf homework is inevitable, then the results of and reactions to <br/>\nparents forcing kids to do homework, with punishments, loss of <br/>\nprivilege, shame... that all becomes &quot;normal&quot;--natural.<br/>\n<br/>\n(There&#39;s some potential for insight and forgiveness for people who <br/>\nthink it&#39;s right and true.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n++++++++++<br/>\n<br/>\nyes, but also some food for thought for those considering unschooling before their kids reach teenage years, or even when they are already showing these signs. i have seen transformation in my teen in the 2 years since leaving school, from fitting that description in the article, to absolutely positively NOT fitting it at all.  i don&#39;t know if all teens are &quot;recoverable&quot; that way, but mine certainly was, thank goodness.<br/>\n<br/>\nlyla<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276701487,"authorName":"Michele K","from":"Michele K &lt;mom2rci@...&gt;","profile":"mom2rci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] feedback on articles about teens?","postDate":"1267546214","msgId":51333,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkxMDgyNC40Mjg2MC5xbUB3ZWI1NzIwNi5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDY5NzcyLjEwMDkxLnFtQHdlYjExMDQwNy5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDAwM0ZDMDNENzIxNjRDREJBQzVGOUM3NzVFMjFGQjg3QExZTEFMQVAyPiA8Njk3NzIuMTAwOTEucW1Ad2ViMTEwNDA3Lm1haWwuZ3ExLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":51296,"nextInTopic":51337,"prevInTime":51332,"nextInTime":51334,"topicId":51233,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"But there is one aspect of truth in the quote, right?
