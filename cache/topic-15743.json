I suppose you could try it with studded tires :-0  He developed the skates so he could go down hills fast when there wasn&#39;t snow.  I stick to fairly level surfaces on them.  Pat has mellowed out with his use of them too.  He leaves the extreme skating to the youngsters.  He does still enjoy an occasional down hill ride though.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy brother is waiting on a patent for a device used in commercial bakeries. <br/>\nLong way to go to get one of those.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe patent process is very specific.
