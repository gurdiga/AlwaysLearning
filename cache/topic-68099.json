If your sister chose to homeschool her daughter by *any* method you guys all might be able to hang out more together and over time your sister could just witness more of your life. You might do some fun stuff together. You could also develop a closer relationship with your niece if you saw her without the rest of her family and this is more likely whatever homeschool method your sister chose. If homeschooling went quite well for the first year your sister might then be more relaxed carrying on into the future and less concerned about where your niece would score in terms of grades etc. So maybe try and support your sister into any homeschooling at first. <br/>\nHowever, you don&#39;t want to put such a good spin on it that you get blamed if it all goes wrong.

In a way, she&#39;d be right - if (if!!!) she were to unschool it would likely look very different than your life because her daughter is not your son (and she has a bunch of other kids besides). That&#39;s why &quot;this is what works for me&quot; advice isn&#39;t so good for helping people understand unschooling - personalities matter, and history matters. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I feel like I have 2 months to<br/>\n&gt; show her how awesome life can be and especially how relationships matter so<br/>\n&gt; much more than school subjects and timelines.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can do that with your niece in school by becoming her friend. If you live close enough, pick her up from school some days and take her to do something fun for an hour. If you live a little farther, have her over on the weekend for a &quot;girls day out&quot;. If you live farther, invite her to spend the rest of the summer with you. Make it a gift you&#39;re giving to both your sister and your niece, a break, a chance for your sister to feel like her daughter has Some adult who can connect and guide her, a chance for your niece to feel supported. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your sister and her daughter don&#39;t get along, there may not be a good short-term fix for that. School, with it&#39;s attempts to make things easier on this girl may well be the better option than her being home with a critical mom who&#39;s going to push-push-push her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If anyone has helped a friend or relative find the path to<br/>\n&gt; unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t attach so much to unschooling. It&#39;s not a panacea. I&#39;ve met a few families for which unschooling was a disaster and the kids were miserable - it takes some skills and resources which not all families have! Don&#39;t blame your sister or yourself if unschooling isn&#39;t a good option for her family. Instead, look for ways to help improve the situation at hand - what can you do right now to ease the stress a bit? Maybe instead of taking the girl out, you can invite all the boys over for a day of boy fun and let mom and daughter have a spa day.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;My whole life I felt my mother didn&#39;t like me,<br/>\n&gt; still feel it. She never understood me, she never defended me, she never<br/>\n&gt; listened to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It won&#39;t help anyone to make your sister&#39;s relationship with her daughter about you. Not you, not the sister, not the niece. Maybe you can use a tiny little bit of that to commiserate with your niece and be her friend, but don&#39;t go overboard or you&#39;ll drive the wedge between mother and daughter deeper. If you decide to become her friend, part of your job is to Support the mother-child relationship. So work on keeping your own baggage separate. That&#39;s important.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;One aunt has always had great relationships with her 3<br/>\n&gt; kids and I wanted her to tell my mom the secret.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Part of the secret is to be someone else, have a different history and a different personality. Part of the secret is to have the right resources - but which resources are &quot;right&quot; is going to vary. It&#39;s much easier to have all the right resources with a kid whose personality is like yours than with a kid who doesn&#39;t like what you like or think the way you think or have needs which make sense to you.  When one child is the &quot;odd man out&quot; in a family, it throws a big, big monkey wrench into the works (mixing my metaphors!). Having an &quot;odd man out&quot; can feel like parents being asked to give up what they want and love for their child - and to an extent that&#39;s true, at least at first. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can help your sister and niece, then do that. Don&#39;t frame it in terms of unschooling or teaching your sister to be a better parent, do it as a gift. But don&#39;t beat yourself up if you don&#39;t have the resources to help them - it won&#39;t help anyone to feel crummy about things you can&#39;t change. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: help for my sister","postDate":"1341664374","msgId":68102,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGp0OWE5bStna3FsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNzcwMWNkNWJlNSQ0NjRkNmM5MCRkMmU4NDViMCRAWmVyYmVAZnJvbnRpZXIuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68101,"nextInTopic":68103,"prevInTime":68101,"nextInTime":68103,"topicId":68099,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Step away from all the school stuff.

I would love to have my sister join me on my<br/>\nunschooling journey. I would love for her to take this one child out of<br/>\nschool and then realize she could take the others out too. The other 3 are<br/>\nboys and are all reading beyond &quot;grade level&quot; and being held back by school.<br/>\nThey can only go so far, one in particular is obviously bored.

That&#39;s why I came to this group.<br/>\nMaybe it&#39;s too OT because it&#39;s not entirely about unschooling. I wish it<br/>\nwere.

I don&#39;t know how to help<br/>\nher. I feel like I can&#39;t just stand by while my sister flails and treats her<br/>\npoorly. Or I&#39;d be just as bad as all the adults in my life who looked the<br/>\nother way and didn&#39;t help ME when I was a kid. When she talks frankly about<br/>\nher daughter, I hear my own mother complaining to one of her sisters about<br/>\nme. I wonder if she did. My whole life I felt my mother didn&#39;t like me,<br/>\nstill feel it. She never understood me, she never defended me, she never<br/>\nlistened to me. We don&#39;t have a relationship now. At all. I remember<br/>\nwondering why my aunts didn&#39;t take my mother aside and tell her there was a<br/>\nbetter way, how to have a better relationship with me. Maybe they didn&#39;t<br/>\nknow a better way. One aunt has always had great relationships with her 3<br/>\nkids and I wanted her to tell my mom the secret. I think is has to do with<br/>\nbeing brave enough to not do what your mom did to you if it was awful.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;However, if your sister knew how you homeschooled, it might be helpful to<br/>\nher.

I illustrated examples of what our typical days might be<br/>\nlike. I tried really hard to explain our lifestyle. No bedtime, no limits on<br/>\nscreen time, no forced workbooks or reading time (although he does often sit<br/>\nand read and I read to him most nights in bed), learning all the time and<br/>\nconnecting subjects and going off on tangents, how I play video games with<br/>\nmy son, how he doesn&#39;t have chores but when I need help I ask and he&#39;ll<br/>\noften do what he can and occasionally not help in which case I just do it<br/>\nmyself, how some days we stay in pajamas and other days we&#39;re all over town,<br/>\nhe takes classes and does sports of his choosing, AND I even said several<br/>\ntimes that I don&#39;t care what kids his age are learning in school. Who<br/>\ndecided what kids should learn and when? Why is it different in different<br/>\nstates? We moved around a lot as our dad was a Marine and I told her how<br/>\nwhen we moved to NC my 8th grade year I felt like I was repeating 7th grade.<br/>\nSome of the math I had done in 6th grade in Hawaii. I even had to read the<br/>\nsame books over. It was like torture. That was the year she repeated 4th<br/>\ngrade, after being told she had dyslexia and spending a year doing special<br/>\nwork, but no one at the new school knew.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s worried about too much TV and video games. I told her how much certain<br/>\ngames have helped my son learn to read (and gave him the desire to read) and<br/>\nproblem solve and so on. She said she gets that kids are learning all the<br/>\ntime, but there is a point when kids have been in front of the tv too long.<br/>\nI admitted that some days all he wants to do is master a level and I might<br/>\nsit and watch, play with him, cheer him on, clean the kitchen, take a<br/>\nshower, bring him food, answer emails, talk on the phone, or any number of<br/>\nthings. And when he was done he&#39;d stop and do something else. I do know this<br/>\nis a hard concept for a lot of people to grasp, so I wasn&#39;t pushing it too<br/>\nhard, just put it out there.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Maybe you could suggest that your sister put that child out for<br/>\nadoption.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I could bring her to my house and raise her but that can&#39;t be the<br/>\nanswer!

Maybe sending her to a different school from her siblings could help (if your sister&#39;s family can afford that).  If she does want to keep her home, maybe a few appointments by phone or skype with Michelle Barone could help her settle on ways to help her daughter and to improve their relationship.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.michellebarone.net/\">http://www.michellebarone.net/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf she wants to know about some typical days, maybe send this:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/typical\">http://sandradodd.com/typical</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThere are ideas for a way to look at unschooling in school terms, too, here:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum\">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum</a><br/>\n<br/>\nFor the sake of your own child and your own family, though, don&#39;t attach to this situation or its outcome.

I don&#39;t know how much info to provide or leave out.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister and I always talked about homeschooling, even before we had kids.<br/>\nWe live in the same state about an hour apart and planned to encourage each<br/>\nother and do stuff together. Years passed and she had several kids close<br/>\ntogether. I think her life became overwhelming so she just sent the oldest<br/>\noff to school when it was time for Kindergarten. She had 4 kids then and<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t see how she could homeschool one while meeting the needs of the<br/>\nother 3 and managing the household. I guess getting 1 out of the house made<br/>\nthings easier. Then with one off to school, might as well send the next one,<br/>\nand the next one. Now she has 5 kids, 4 are in school (ages 6, 9, 10, 12)<br/>\nand a 2yo at home.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe middle child who just turned 9 is not doing well in school. She probably<br/>\nhas dyslexia (my sister had it and we think my dad did as well) and although<br/>\nshe has not been officially tested for dyslexia, she attends special classes<br/>\nevery day. She had delayed speech and issues with sounds and has been in<br/>\nspeech therapy for years. This makes her miss whatever is going on in her<br/>\nregular class, so she is behind in all subjects. For some reason the<br/>\nteachers do not make her do the work the other kids are doing. They cross<br/>\noff the math problems she doesn&#39;t have to do so she only does the easy ones<br/>\n(like 8+1, she doesn&#39;t have to do 32+23 that the other kids do). They allow<br/>\nher to copy the spelling word list while other kids are taking a test. They<br/>\ngive her coloring pages instead of reading. This is 3rd grade, btw. I can<br/>\nonly imagine what her self esteem is like. She has to know she is different<br/>\nand being treated differently.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister told me she is thinking of keeping her out of school next year and<br/>\nI said YES, DO IT! She wants to but she is scared. She does not get along<br/>\nwith her 9yo and thinks having her at home will be a nightmare. She has a<br/>\n2yo too. They seem to have nothing in common and my sister doesn&#39;t know what<br/>\nto do or how to help her. She is still stuck on the notion that kids &quot;need<br/>\nto know certain things&quot; and thinking she won&#39;t be able to teach her<br/>\nanything. She knows what it&#39;s like to have dyslexia, having been through it,<br/>\nbut when my sister was diagnosed at age 10, she dove into the program head<br/>\nfirst. She did well memorizing flash cards and listening to phonics<br/>\nrecords/tapes and completing the workbooks. She worked really hard all the<br/>\nway through high school and even college. But this is part of who she is,<br/>\nstrong willed and disciplined, and why it made sense for her to join the<br/>\nMarine Corps at 18. She was all set to go to Iraq (I was going to help her<br/>\nhusband out with the older 2 while she was gone) but she got pregnant with<br/>\nthis child, her 3rd, and didn&#39;t go. (Hmm. wonder if there is a bit of<br/>\nresentment there? She loved being a Marine and trained all those years to go<br/>\nto war and never went.)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, her daughter is NOT like her at all. She is messy; my sister is<br/>\nNEAT, everything must be organized and in its place. She is creative, always<br/>\ndrawing (happens to be left handed); my sister cannot draw and doesn&#39;t see<br/>\nherself as creative. My sister says she is sassy and defiant, has a temper<br/>\nand throws fits, doesn&#39;t listen and won&#39;t do things she is asked to do. They<br/>\nare at odds and my sister had 4 other kids who also need her. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI have 1 child who just turned 8. My sister knows he&#39;s never been to school<br/>\nbut doesn&#39;t know we&#39;re unschooling (and we&#39;re on the radical side,<br/>\nunschooling life and parenting in a very different way than she is). She has<br/>\nbeen asking me questions about how we do things and what our days are like.<br/>\nShe wants recommendations for curriculum and I have no experience there. She<br/>\nwants to make sure she &quot;stays at grade level&quot; or rather catches up to where<br/>\nshe is &quot;supposed to be&quot; since she&#39;s not there now. I don&#39;t want to scare her<br/>\naway from homeschooling, but we are about as unstructured as it gets. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t believe there is a place where all kids should be, I don&#39;t believe<br/>\ntests are helpful, I don&#39;t believe grades are relevant. We don&#39;t have much<br/>\nof a schedule; we eat when we&#39;re hungry and sleep when we&#39;re tired. We might<br/>\nstay at home and play wii in our pajamas or drive across town to visit fun<br/>\nplaces. My son takes classes he wants to when he is interested in something.<br/>\nWe fly by the seat of our pants a lot more than she would be comfortable<br/>\nwith. Since it is summer and her kids are out of school, it&#39;s easier to get<br/>\ntogether with them. Recently we took the kids swimming and last night went<br/>\nto a rodeo together so I&#39;m seeing her kids more than usual. I feel a<br/>\nconnection with her daughter because she is a lot like me (left-handed,<br/>\ncreative, defiant, low self esteem because of a mother who doesn&#39;t like her<br/>\n- my sister did NOT have this issue, she was the clear favorite and had a<br/>\nVERY different relationship with our mother!).<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI just found out my sister&#39;s biggest fear is what if she pulls her out of<br/>\nschool and tries homeschooling for one year but can&#39;t take it and puts her<br/>\nback and she&#39;s not any further along than where she is right now. She was<br/>\ntested a few months ago and scored the equivalent of first grade, first<br/>\nmonth (1.1) in math and reading and this was towards the end of 3rd grade.<br/>\nShe is NOT ready for 4th grade, but the school would just shuffle her along.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I could help her, but I&#39;m not sure what to suggest or say or do.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKim Zerbe<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68073,"nextTopicId":68111}}
