Little art galleries, for instance, are a great way to see some really interesting stuff - and rather than wanting to buy it, kids may be inspired to play with some of the ideas, themselves.

I found it easier to find activities to do together that were fun for kids. We spent a lot of time outdoors exploring. We brought lunches to different parks or found free activities around town. We&#39;d have pizza night and a movie at one of our houses. We would make the pizza from scratch...even the dough. That was more fun than just buying it. I think having a friend with not a lot of money was helpful. <br/>\nI would avoid stores. I see thing I didn&#39;t even know I wanted or needed when I go shopping. It&#39;s even harder for young kids.<br/>\n In the future you might look for free fish, heater, tank...ask around. I know I&#39;ve often had friends that didn&#39;t want pets anymore for one reason or another. We adopted a guinea pig when a friend left town. We got a chinchilla that a friend didn&#39;t want anymore. I got a very old frog one time. He didn&#39;t live long, but we enjoyed him. We&#39;ve taken in unwanted fish. Ask around and you might be able to find a heater for your fish. You might be able to borrow an old gaming system from a friend and the games. If you know someone that has older kids they might be looking to pass on some items to younger kids. <br/>\n<br/>\n***So one fish died and the other one isn&#39;t looking too well while we save more<br/>\nchange for a heater.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of items in my house that stay warm. I think the top of the fridge is one. The TV is warm while on. The floor over our heater is always warmer than the rest of our house....radio, computer etc. You might be able to find a &quot;heater&quot; for the fish if you look around.  A small heat input could be enough. Beta fish can live in small quantities of water, so if it&#39;s in a big tank you could put in something that is a fairly small volume and that might be easier to heat. A small jar will even work.  You could make a bag of rice or beans or something such as that and heat it in the microwave if you have one. That could be a heat source. I would insulate the container the fish is in. Cover the top leaving a hole in the top for air and maybe a viewing window in the front. Leave the bottom uninsulated for heat input.  Cardboard and Styrofoam are often easy to find and are good insulators. I would insulate the bag or rice or beans if you use that so that any heat loss goes to the fish and not to the surrounding room. Your kids might enjoy problem solving and finding away to keep the fish warm. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMeg<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cfebsleb@...\">cfebsleb@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":442033011,"authorName":"Gwen Montoya","from":"Gwen Montoya &lt;lifeisjustthis@...&gt;","profile":"willow_selene","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Ideas for creating an atmosphere of abundance with little money","postDate":"1358011761","msgId":70266,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBTWc9SHBkWFlaOVluY1M2RDdnd2U3UTJpUXY9M3N2UFVEcEJZRlJSVWpKUk9tUUZMd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEE4OTUxQTMyRjM4NDQ2NTJBNjM4REEzNTUzOTE2REE3QERlYm9yYWhQQz4=","referencesHeader":"PGtjcXNkdSt0MDhoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8MjQ5MUU5QkEtOTE4Ni00QjkwLTk4REUtRDk4RTIxQ0QzNUYyQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPgk8MTM1ODAwNjA4MS41OTQ3OS5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViMTgyMjA2Lm1haWwuYmYxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4JPEE4OTUxQTMyRjM4NDQ2NTJBNjM4REEzNTUzOTE2REE3QERlYm9yYWhQQz4="},"prevInTopic":70265,"nextInTopic":70268,"prevInTime":70265,"nextInTime":70267,"topicId":70257,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Depending on where you are, there may be lots of free activities at libraries or state fair grounds.

Making your innocent kids party to neglect and death will be worse for them than being without toys for awhile.  And it’s as bad as it gets for the fish. <br/>\n<br/>\n***So I need ideas for ways to create an atmosphere of abundance with little money. What non-money related things can I do? ***<br/>\n<br/>\nDon’t take them to the store with you if you can’t get some things they want. Do your shopping when they can stay home.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we were without cable TV we asked friends to record things they were watching anyway and let us borrow.  My sister shares our love of old, bad movies, so would send us a box of movies and a few things she recorded from television each week and we’d watch and send them back.  That was fun, getting a package every week, not knowing what fun movies would be inside. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe had friends in Arkansas who would send us pretty leaves and branches with berries, and snake skins, and little dead dried up lizards, and dead bugs, and all that was very exotic and interesting since they had plants and creatures there that we never saw here.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can get books and music and movies at the library if you’re near one.  You can read to them while they play or color. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a printer and some paper you can print lots of things to color. You can print mazes and foldable masks and buildings and all kinds of things. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can make puppets and masks from paper or paper grocery bags. Make paper airplanes. Make paper mache. We used to cut paper dolls and animals and whatnot out of catalogs and magazines. Sometimes they’d get tied to the train tracks or eaten by monsters and sometimes they’d become part of a collage or a story or a home made comic book.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe cut words from junk mail and glued them to paper to make ransom or blackmail letters.  When I was cleaning out my mom’s house I found a few of those that we’d sent to Grandpa. “Dear Grandpa, if you ever want to see The Beans again, be at our house Tuesday with some peanuts.” <br/>\n<br/>\nDylan really liked to talk into a recorder. He’d pretend he was reporting on some disaster, usually involving monsters. <br/>\n<br/>\nAct out some of their favorite books or TV shows. Be as silly or serious as they want. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe went on adventures. We’d pack a lunch and something to drink and go to the park, or start out on a walk not knowing where we were going. I’d pull Dylan in the wagon.  We did that in the wintertime too, when it wasn’t too cold, and take the sled instead. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe played lots of games. Maybe you can borrow some board games from friends.  You can make up your own Mad Libs and have silly stories. You can make up your own version of Mancala with a muffin tin and little stones or marbles. If you have cards or dice you can make up lots of different games to play with those. There are lots of free games to play online. <br/>\n<br/>\nBorrow puzzles from friends. <br/>\n<br/>\nClear a big space in one room and have a dance party. Play some old music your kids might have never heard. It may only last ten minutes.  While you have a big space cleared you can put down some butcher paper or cut open some paper grocery bags and lay on the floor and color. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can spare an old bed sheet you can make something new: mummy wraps, little pillows or pouches, clothes for dolls, capes, silly hats. You can decorate the new stuff with markers. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes your town have a community pool? A playground? Bike trails? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a car and can get out, take food and go for a drive to a big open space in the country and play Frisbee or kick ball or fly homemade kites or just roam around. We used to walk by the river and collect sticks and pretty rocks and feathers. It always felt like we were coming home with treasures.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have friends or family who will come visit and bring cookies? I’d ask grandparents, if they live nearby.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDylan used to really like playing in a big dishpan of cornmeal. If you can afford that. You can put a cut open garbage bag under the pan and kids, and recycle some of what gets spilled. You can make dinosaur landscapes, bury dolls, all kinds of things. There are recipes online for home made play-doh and other goopy things, if you can manage those ingredients. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope some of those ideas give you a place to start. Do what your kids like to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been times when things were really tight for us. I mean no gas money and beans and rice for dinner every night.   And if I had it to do it again I would use the credit card more. Not go crazy but if twenty or thirty dollars made a big difference in the life of my kid then I’d do that. If you’re justifying coffee and makeup or other adult things that aren’t strictly necessary,  then make that same effort to justify some things your kids might like, too. Don’t always sacrifice kid things because they seem less important or urgent.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut don’t underestimate how wonderful your happy presence can be for your kids. Be sweet and playful and optimistic and involved. Give them lots of your time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Ideas for creating an atmosphere of abundance with little money","postDate":"1358006544","msgId":70263,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNTgwMDY1NDQuMTA1MzQuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE4MjIwMy5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNTgwMDYzMDEuOTIyMDAuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE4MjIwMS5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGtjczA4ZitmaHU4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MTM1ODAwNjMwMS45MjIwMC5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViMTgyMjAxLm1haWwuYmYxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":70262,"nextInTopic":70264,"prevInTime":70262,"nextInTime":70264,"topicId":70257,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"And Another Board with ideas :  http://pinterest.com/melissatulip/the-fun-board/ Alex Polikowsky [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2027247389\">And Another Board with ideas :<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pinterest.com/melissatulip/the-fun-board/\">http://pinterest.com/melissatulip/the-fun-board/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Ideas for creating an atmosphere of abundance with little money","postDate":"1358006301","msgId":70262,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNTgwMDYzMDEuOTIyMDAuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE4MjIwMS5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGtjczA4ZitmaHU4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtjczA4ZitmaHU4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":70261,"nextInTopic":70263,"prevInTime":70261,"nextInTime":70263,"topicId":70257,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Great Ideas Rach!
