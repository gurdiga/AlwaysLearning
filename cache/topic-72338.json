A lot of boundaries exist to make things easier for parents... and then end up creating conflict as kids &quot;push the boundaries&quot; which isn&#39;t easier at all.

Be willing to listen to their reasoning too! If they poke holes in your logic, re-consider your position! It will set them up to be more willing to honor the spirit of your concerns if they know you aren&#39;t going to be bullheaded about the details.

They know different places, different friends&#39; homes have different rules.

There&#39;s going to be anger, resentment, feelings of betrayal, distrust. That&#39;s going to be reflected in kids&#39; behavior. They&#39;re going to react more to the parent than the parenting. The reaction will be amplified by parenting choices that feel to them like, &quot;What I want for you is more important than what you want.&quot; It&#39;s just a big echoey reminder of what was done to them in the divorce.</div><div><br></div></div><div>Joyce</div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":459359078,"authorName":"D.

But in the chocolate example, the kinder thing may be to restrict the chocolate for now, if she considers that her daughter will have trouble making sense of abundant chocolate, in the context of the other parent&#39;s views and their family&#39;s history.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s important that the mother focus on where her children are at and what is likely to help them at this point in time.  Taking care to make any changes slowly and mindfully.  The kids have probably had a lot of upheaval already.  They need their mother not to be hastily taking on new parenting ideas.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey need her to be as calm as she can in the face of the turmoil.  I would focus on thinking of what will help her children best in these circumstances, rather than thinking of changing parenting practices.<br/>\n<br/>\nDebbie.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 05/10/2013, at 9:25 AM, Sandra Dodd wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; This is once removed, but I thought it was worth bringing here anyway.

Sometimes the court steps in and forces parents to agree on a method. <br/>\n<br/>\n  My advice would be for your friend to focus on her relationship with her daughter and not on how specifically to handle each situation.  The closer she feels to her daughter, the better things will go in general.  If their relationship is solid, she can explain how things are because of the divorce and they can come up with a solution together.  Even if the solution is that she can choose her foods with mom, but with dad it&#39;s better to just go with his preferences and not say &quot;but mom lets me&quot; because it could end up being decided by a mediator.  It&#39;s a sad situation.  And perhaps her daughter is too young to understand or too stressed to agree to disagree.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nAli</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Question about children in a divorce","postDate":"1380929924","msgId":72339,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZEQzRGODVFLUFCNEEtNDM1OC05OTZGLTVFRjgzQzFBMkFBNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDYzNEMwRkM1LTIwNzQtNDBCOS1BMTEzLTQ5Q0VBNUY4MEE3NUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDYzNEMwRkM1LTIwNzQtNDBCOS1BMTEzLTQ5Q0VBNUY4MEE3NUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":72338,"nextInTopic":72341,"prevInTime":72338,"nextInTime":72340,"topicId":72338,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"For unschoolers who are not divorced, I want to say:  Find ways to strenghten and maintain your marriage.
