Before I quote part of it, I want to  <br/>\n&gt; share something from &quot;Teach Your Own&quot;--John Holt quoting an article  <br/>\n&gt; called &quot;Pumping Polysyllabism, from August 1977 Mother Jones (I  <br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t find that article):<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *******************<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Two Chicago English professors have found that a good way to improve  <br/>\n&gt; your grade on a term paper is to use what they call &quot;verbose,  <br/>\n&gt; bombastic&quot; language.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Professors Joseph Williams and Rosemary Hake say they took a well- <br/>\n&gt; written paper and changed the language a bit.  They kept the ideas  <br/>\n&gt; and concepts the same, but wrote two different versions--one in  <br/>\n&gt; simplified, straightforward language and another in verbose language,  <br/>\n&gt; loaded with pedantic terms.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They then submitted the two papers to nine high school teachers; they  <br/>\n&gt; were surprised to find that all nine gave the verbose papers nearly  <br/>\n&gt; perfect scores but downgraded the straightforward essays as too  <br/>\n&gt; simple and shallow.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The professors then submitted the same two papers to ninety more  <br/>\n&gt; teachers and came up with similar results.  Three out of four high  <br/>\n&gt; school teachers and two out of three college professors gave higher  <br/>\n&gt; marks to pompous writing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ***************(end of the quote)***********<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The premise of the DiMeglio article is that hallucinations are like  <br/>\n&gt; dreams, and hallucinations have to do with mental and emotional  <br/>\n&gt; disorders, so TV being like dreams in some ways.... well  I shouldn&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; do him any favors by extracting clarity from muck.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s the middle of the article.   The beginning and end aren&#39;t any  <br/>\n&gt; better:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; +++++++++++++++++++<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It is not only in the dream that the vision of each individual person  <br/>\n&gt; is necessarily different. That is obvious. Importantly, the  <br/>\n&gt; experience of television is uniquely that of the individual.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Television may be understood as a creation of generalized thought.  <br/>\n&gt; The ability of thought to describe or reconfigure sense is ultimately  <br/>\n&gt; dependent upon the extent to which thought is similar to sense.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Television makes thought even more like vision than in the dream,  <br/>\n&gt; thereby reducing thought and vision.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ++++++++++++(end of the quote)+++++++<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m going to link that anti-TV article on this page<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/t/anti\">http://sandradodd.com/t/anti</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I like that his writing and thinking are so garbled, while my own  <br/>\n&gt; teens are so articulate.

Frank Martin DiMeglio<br/>\nWhat can you do to help?<br/>\n<br/>\n==============================<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a very short article.   Before I quote part of it, I want to  <br/>\nshare something from &quot;Teach Your Own&quot;--John Holt quoting an article  <br/>\ncalled &quot;Pumping Polysyllabism, from August 1977 Mother Jones (I  <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t find that article):<br/>\n<br/>\n*******************<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo Chicago English professors have found that a good way to improve  <br/>\nyour grade on a term paper is to use what they call &quot;verbose,  <br/>\nbombastic&quot; language.<br/>\n<br/>\nProfessors Joseph Williams and Rosemary Hake say they took a well- <br/>\nwritten paper and changed the language a bit.  They kept the ideas  <br/>\nand concepts the same, but wrote two different versions--one in  <br/>\nsimplified, straightforward language and another in verbose language,  <br/>\nloaded with pedantic terms.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey then submitted the two papers to nine high school teachers; they  <br/>\nwere surprised to find that all nine gave the verbose papers nearly  <br/>\nperfect scores but downgraded the straightforward essays as too  <br/>\nsimple and shallow.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe professors then submitted the same two papers to ninety more  <br/>\nteachers and came up with similar results.  Three out of four high  <br/>\nschool teachers and two out of three college professors gave higher  <br/>\nmarks to pompous writing.<br/>\n<br/>\n***************(end of the quote)***********<br/>\n<br/>\nThe premise of the DiMeglio article is that hallucinations are like  <br/>\ndreams, and hallucinations have to do with mental and emotional  <br/>\ndisorders, so TV being like dreams in some ways.... well  I shouldn&#39;t  <br/>\ndo him any favors by extracting clarity from muck.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the middle of the article.   The beginning and end aren&#39;t any  <br/>\nbetter:<br/>\n<br/>\n+++++++++++++++++++<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not only in the dream that the vision of each individual person  <br/>\nis necessarily different. That is obvious. Importantly, the  <br/>\nexperience of television is uniquely that of the individual.<br/>\n<br/>\nTelevision may be understood as a creation of generalized thought.  <br/>\nThe ability of thought to describe or reconfigure sense is ultimately  <br/>\ndependent upon the extent to which thought is similar to sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nTelevision makes thought even more like vision than in the dream,  <br/>\nthereby reducing thought and vision.<br/>\n<br/>\n++++++++++++(end of the quote)+++++++<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to link that anti-TV article on this page<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/t/anti\">http://sandradodd.com/t/anti</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI like that his writing and thinking are so garbled, while my own  <br/>\nteens are so articulate.  Holly&#39;s up watching a DVD of Fresh Prince  <br/>\nof Bel-Air and Marty was playing Rock Band when he got tired of  <br/>\nwatching a DVD he got for Christmas of Tenacious D episodes from HBO.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey both got books for Christmas, too, and lots of music and  <br/>\nmovies.  Holly got a sewing machine. Marty got a skateboard (from  <br/>\nHolly) and a drum stool and some new Rock Band drums.     I&#39;m not  <br/>\nworried about them at all.   This guy with the terrible article on  <br/>\nthe evils of TV (and of sleeping and dreaming, it seems), though...  <br/>\nhe could use some clarity (and sleep, and dreaming, and TV-watching,  <br/>\nand Rock Band playing, maybe).<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41167,"nextTopicId":41169}}
