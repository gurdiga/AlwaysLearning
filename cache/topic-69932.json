I had backed off reading messages in this list for the past year.  Things were messy and stressful with work, I was focusing on things I needed to do to ensure I was employed and that we had food on the table and could pay for the things we enjoy. I didn&#39;t really realize how stressed out I had become until I started noticing how often I was snapping responses, and how often my children were snapping responses back.  I found myself stuck in a rut of being unkind, and responding without being mindful of the choices I had in front of me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRealizing that I was headed in the wrong direction, and seeing the effects so clearly in how all my family was interacting with eachother was enough to wake me up. Interestingly, I jumped onto this list and read through a couple topics and soon felt equipped with the tools I was already in possession of, I had just set them aside. Thanks to the solid, dedicated, and repetitive words of Sandra, and Joyce, and Pam, and Meredith, and so many others, I was able to put those tools back into my parenting toolbox.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realized how very important it is to pay attention to my responses, to take a moment and see the possible choices I had, to remember to be sweet, and loving, and kind whenever I possibly could.  The change has been rapid, and we all feel better.  But it was easy for me to fall off-track simply because I got all wrapped-up into what I thought were more pressing things.  Nothing is more pressing than the happiness and emotional and physical well-being of my kids!  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;When I don&#39;t see their point of view, react and then apologize how wishy-washy do my children view me, or are they seeing that I am trying?

If I mess up I apologize.  I hug my girls, I rub their feet, I brush their hair.  I just do whatever I can to make sure they know that I absolutely love them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been unschooling for 5 years.  I&#39;ve been trying to be a mindful loving Mama for 10.

And send myself in another direction, change the subject, focus my attention elsewhere, away from the details of what and how learning might/should/could happen and on to what my kids were doing in that moment.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Saying sorry, iPad","postDate":"1356288742","msgId":69958,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtiN2p0NittbmpuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PENBTjhGeEwzTXBBaGdPRno4MktYMlRXeXlQMGJWWmU0cnNiUU5NNlRyR0tXMEZ3Ri1KZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":69955,"nextInTopic":69959,"prevInTime":69957,"nextInTime":69959,"topicId":69932,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Kids getting older helps, too. Practice helps more when you recognize your successes, even small ones, and use your less-than-perfect moments as a chance to think and learn, rather than beat yourself up for failing. At first, it may seem like all your best ideas come after the fact - but even those ideas can be stored for later, added to your options for next time. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;When a child falls short of something,<br/>\n&gt; when/ how do you realize the child wasn&#39;t old/mature enough to handle a<br/>\n&gt; situation?

Is it in the set-up that you guys know the difference? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The difference isn&#39;t really important. For one thing, adults regularly make mistakes where they over-estimate what they can handle. It&#39;s normal. In fact, I think it&#39;s endemic among people who run their own businesses ;) What comes from experience (not maturity) is knowing how and when to bail out versus shoving through and getting things done - and part of that comes from learning to have a back-up plan - even a fuzzy back-up plan like &quot;yell for help&quot;. In fact, in the world of very small businesses, yelling for help is a pretty standard plan - the shop I work for trades off favors with half a dozen other small businesses at need: my sewing machine is down, can I use yours? I can&#39;t finish this job in time, would you mind taking part of it? I threw my back, can I borrow your part-timer for a week? Knowing you can get help to get over a hump can be the difference between success and failure in small businesses.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Or when is it that the child COULD have handled it, but decided<br/>\n&gt; not to?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The other thing is to realize that Deciding one isn&#39;t going to handle something can be really healthy. It&#39;s not a bad skill for a child to learn - it&#39;s good to realize that one doesn&#39;t Have To do everything asked of one. A lot of kids don&#39;t get the chance to learn that until they&#39;re adults, and then it&#39;s easy to be the martyr - oh, my life is so hard, I Have To do All These Things... Better to learn to say &quot;you know, I really don&#39;t think I&#39;m up for that right now&quot; and save a lot of stress. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":284087656,"authorName":"Karen","from":"&quot;Karen&quot; &lt;semajrak@...&gt;","profile":"semajrak","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Saying sorry, iPad","postDate":"1356276499","msgId":69955,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtiNzd1ais3cHFnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxMzgwMWNkZTBiZSRlYTRlZTcyMCRiZWVjYjU2MCRAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":69945,"nextInTopic":69958,"prevInTime":69954,"nextInTime":69956,"topicId":69932,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... should only have a cupcake if he Deserves one.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1987253618\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The idea that he should Earn his cupcake is tied up in the idea that he<br/>\n </span></blockquote>should only have a cupcake if he Deserves one.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople seem to do this with a lot of things. In our circle of friends, we see it with video games as well as sweets.  If you get good grades, then you can get another iPad game.  If you pick up after yourself, then you can have a bit more time on the computer.  <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What pressure!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What pressure, indeed!!  And, I believe it muddies the waters.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis past week, we were visiting family.  A cousin my son (Ethan) loves to play with was shocked to learn that our ten year old son knows the password to our iPad Apps account.  My sister-in-law thought that was a very bad idea.  She said her son (the cousin) would rack up a bill she could never afford.  Ethan, who was sitting there listening, said, &quot;Well, I always ask first.&quot;  And, he does always check in with us before he makes a purchase.  About half the time he offers to pay for the games from his allowance.  We&#39;ve never asked him to do so.  He thinks it&#39;s fun buying things with his money.  Sometimes it&#39;s a string of games he wants.  Sometimes they are free.  Some days it might be that we spend $10 on a few games.  Months can go by where we spend $0. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, that night after the conversation about the password, we were back at our hotel.  I was relaxing on the bed watching television.  Ethan came over to me and said &quot;I really like it that you guys let me get games on the iPad.&quot;  He was looking me right in the eyes.  He was smiling, but I could tell he was also searching for something.  So I sat up, took his hands in mine, smiled and looked calmly in his eyes for a moment.  I said, &quot;It&#39;s fun, isn&#39;t it!&quot;  He wrapped his arms around me and said, &quot;Yeah, it is!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re very fortunate we can afford much of what he asks for right now.  Really, he asks for very little anyway.  But, even if we had less income, I wouldn&#39;t make him perform to get the things he wants.  I see what that does in other families.  It erodes trust.  What I have noticed in our family, is that if I am a trustworthy person, who doesn&#39;t act in manipulative ways to get my son to do what I want him to do, my son can be himself too.  I completely trust him.  He knows that, and naturally acts in ways that preserves our relationship.  He&#39;s only ten, as I said, so time will confirm or deny any merit to this way we live.  But I&#39;ll tell you now, it&#39;s easier keeping things honest and clear and free of all the manipulation games of conventional parenting.  Easier for Ethan for sure.  But I&#39;m finding it much, much easier for me too.  Clearer, it seems, for both of us.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":443652592,"authorName":"Stephanie Selby","from":"Stephanie Selby &lt;babelsgp@...&gt;","profile":"babelsgp","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Saying sorry, iPad","postDate":"1356236315","msgId":69945,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBTjhGeEwzcHhZbmhMbTB5bWFKaE1CdS1YV01UaFZzUU5PVD1rRFU2X2RzUkpXajN2UUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxMzgwMWNkZTBiZSRlYTRlZTcyMCRiZWVjYjU2MCRAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PENBTjhGeEwzTXBBaGdPRno4MktYMlRXeXlQMGJWWmU0cnNiUU5NNlRyR0tXMEZ3Ri1KZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JPDAxMzgwMWNkZTBiZSRlYTRlZTcyMCRiZWVjYjU2MCRAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":69942,"nextInTopic":69955,"prevInTime":69944,"nextInTime":69946,"topicId":69932,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- Or if he just decided he didn t want to complete it because it was more work than he WANTED to do, he COULD have made more if he had decided to work","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-687614716\">-=- Or if he just decided he didn&#39;t want to complete it because it<br/>\n<br/>\nwas more work than he WANTED to do, he COULD have made more if he had<br/>\ndecided to work harder.

I feel like I do my fair share of battling the egocentric parent,<br/>\nthat would be myself here, in that I will want something done my way or<br/>\nright now. I am not as calm as I&#39;d like to be and I struggle with the<br/>\nthinking and being thoughtful when it comes to all facets of life,<br/>\nincluding parenting, and I have been more of a type-A personality that is<br/>\nlearning that life is best to watch and see than it is to take life by the<br/>\nhorns. I have gotten to be much more at peace with the way I parent, as I<br/>\nsit back and watch more and listen a lot more and really try to see life<br/>\nthrough their eyes, as people I truly care about. I struggle because I was<br/>\nraised by the hand that dealt a spanking when there needed to be a reason<br/>\nto cry, rather than I was crying because I did have a reason, even if I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t verbalize it.  So I do mess up, and I do apologize. I do not have<br/>\na problem with apologizing; I do not have a part of my personality that has<br/>\na hard time apologizing or seeing from another&#39;s point of view. Ideally<br/>\nreacting, all the time, in such a way that I wouldn&#39;t often have a reason<br/>\nto apologize, meaning that I have finally let-go of expectations, and rely<br/>\non trust and acceptance. This is hard for me. It is a constant<br/>\nself-assessment.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo where am I? I am undergoing a transition and I have explained this to my<br/>\n7 year old, and I think she kind of understands what I am meaning.<br/>\nSometimes it feels like I am apologizing a lot, I also have ADHD, so my<br/>\nimpulse control isn&#39;t fantastic, but I quickly realize there may be a<br/>\nbetter way to solve something. As mindful parenting matures, does this ever<br/>\nbecome more effortless, or is it always a constant watch of what you are<br/>\ndoing? When I don&#39;t see their point of view, react and then apologize how<br/>\nwishy-washy do my children view me, or are they seeing that I am trying? A<br/>\nlot of you have been through this, but I am IN it, I don&#39;t know the<br/>\noutcomes. Is wishy-washiness even an issue I should concern myself with?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy parental role models are my father who went to military school, my<br/>\ngrandfather the Naval Academy and my mother who was more tender, though she<br/>\nwould have outbursts, she tried to see from my point of view and did<br/>\napologize. She still struggles with acceptance by others and expecting<br/>\nchildren to act a certain way. Neither were good at knowing what could be<br/>\nexpected from a child at certain ages, like being &quot;good&quot; at a store/<br/>\nrestaurant etc. Along those lines with the expectation that the 12 year old<br/>\nboy could handle 3 weeks of work.
