He doesn&#39;t get as many stories told about him as Kirby does.  <br/>\nHe&#39;s more quiet (in a quantity, not quality way--he&#39;s loud when he does talk) <br/>\nand more comfortable in himself and in the world than the other two kids, so <br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t get the tales of conflict, or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday I was on the city&#39;s police department webpages, trying to find out <br/>\nwhere to report my half-brother&#39;s possible wherabouts.  Four phone calls <br/>\nlater, I still hadn&#39;t found anyone to take the information.   But in the <br/>\ncourse of looking, I found summer sessions of the Junior Police Academy.  <br/>\nFive days in June, free, to honor students who are recommended by a sponsor.<br/>\n<br/>\nHuh.  We have no &quot;honor&quot; status and he has no principal, counsellor, school <br/>\nresource officer or scout leader.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut we do have a friend who&#39;s a city policeman.  And in the SCA, he&#39;s a <br/>\nknight.  And he was squired to someone who was my husband&#39;s squire.  So we <br/>\nhave a real relationship and he&#39;s known Marty since he was a baby (and I&#39;ve <br/>\nknown AElric since he was a long-haired college kid).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s one.<br/>\nAnd I talked to the coordinator who after going through the list of <br/>\npossibilities, sending them what I have to send the state, or test score <br/>\nresults, understood that I have no such stuff.   So  I think I&#39;ll write a <br/>\nletter, enclose a copy of the interview in HEM to try to prove I&#39;m not <br/>\ntotally just individually off the wall, and tell him it will add to the <br/>\ndiversity of their academy. <br/>\n<br/>\nYeah.  Whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty, I thought, might or might not be interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s said for most of a year now he wants to be a cop or an air force MP, or <br/>\na wrestler. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI said &quot;You need to be able to run for 20 minutes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Sprinting or jogging?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Oh, jogging, I&#39;m sure.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said he could do that.  I read more later.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Can you do twenty push-ups?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;GOD no, maybe twelve.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Well by June, you need to do twenty.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought maybe he was going to balk because of that, but last night he was <br/>\ntelling his friends he was GOING to this session and it was going to be cool. <br/>\n I said &quot;MIGHT go, Marty,&quot; and he said, &quot;NO, I&#39;m GOING!&quot;  And Mark Elrick <br/>\n(who&#39;s Sir AElric in the SCA) already called and said he&#39;d write a letter to <br/>\nhelp Marty get in.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe age range is 12 to 14.  Marty&#39;s 14.  I never heard of it before, but then <br/>\nagain, Marty hadn&#39;t told me two years ago that he might want to be a <br/>\npoliceman.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad to see he&#39;s excited about it.   I hope he&#39;ll be accepted!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13113,"nextTopicId":13117}}
