And so with the same pointing that points toward unschooling I <br/>\nHAVE to point away from a curriculum.  I &quot;just say no&quot; to requests for me to <br/>\nhelp find a curriculum the same way I&#39;d just say no if someone was asking me <br/>\nto lend them illegal weapon and some rubber gloves and a ski mask to pay a <br/>\nvisit to the Circle K.<br/>\n<br/>\nExtreme perhaps, but if people choose a a curriculum it won&#39;t be because I <br/>\nhelped.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here&#39;s the behind-the-scenes peek:  <br/>\nI think a curriculum can work okay in some cases.   I could have really gone <br/>\nfor something like that myself when I was a teenager, and would have done it <br/>\nmyself without anyone making me or having to help me much.  My objection is <br/>\nthe the abuse of materials by parents who know diddly about human development <br/>\nand learning.  It pretty much amounts to abuse of the kids, then, at some <br/>\npoint (sometimes the very first moment and ever thereafter).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s like the arguments against teaching.   I teach all the time.  I teach <br/>\nwhen I speak at unschooling conferences.  I teach a dozen thirty-second <br/>\nlessons a day around here, whether it&#39;s how to use Comet cleanser or how <br/>\napostrophes work.   But I think it&#39;s like playing jazz.  First people need to <br/>\nreally learn to play the instrument, to operate the equipment.  And THEN they <br/>\ncan improvise.   And &quot;the equipment,&quot; the basic instrument of unschooling is <br/>\nto be able to see and trust natural learning.   Until that&#39;s internalized and <br/>\ncan be played in the dark, by ear, not even thinking about it, teaching will <br/>\ntoo often result in disruption of the process, and will erode the learners&#39; <br/>\nability and confidence.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven well-intended unschoolers can do that kind of damage to learning and <br/>\nconfidence that school-at-home families can do if they don&#39;t guard against it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam Sorooshian and I were having a chat the other day I wish I had saved, but <br/>\nmaybe we can reproduce some of the ideas.  (Pam&#39;s about to leave town for a <br/>\nweek and some, but might not be gone yet.)   It concerned the idea that <br/>\nunschooling is a spiritual ...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m out of a noun.  A spiritual endeavor?   That when you get comfortable <br/>\nwith unschooling it&#39;s the same as some of the descriptions of spiritual goals?<br/>\n<br/>\n(Feel free, anyone to jump in if a useful phrase comes upon you!!)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I think it might be is a philosophical position involving awareness in <br/>\nthe moment.  That&#39;s not common in this culture.  We reserve most &quot;philosophy&quot; <br/>\nand &quot;religion&quot; to religion.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are people who &quot;study philosophy&quot; who don&#39;t even seem to have a <br/>\nphilosophy, or who don&#39;t seem to know philosophy is an actually useful thing. <br/>\n They can tell you all about Greeks and Germans and worldviews, but they&#39;re <br/>\nmaking their own daily decisions thoughtlessly.   They studied the study of <br/>\nphilosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here comes something which can (doesn&#39;t have to, but has the potential to) <br/>\nturn into a lifestyle and &quot;practice&quot; which does kind of resemble mindfulness <br/>\nand right living.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe definition has to be discussed constantly not because we&#39;re not sure of <br/>\nit, and not just because there are always newcomers, but because it&#39;s the <br/>\nexamination of the ideas and our beliefs and actions that creates the <br/>\nunderstanding which forms the basis of the relationships within the family.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a new situation comes up here, I run back through all the &quot;rules&quot; and <br/>\nprinciples we&#39;ve used before to try to apply it to the new situation.   Marty <br/>\nhas left without telling me a couple of times.  Not far, and not for long, <br/>\nbut on what basis do we make policies?  Who am I being if I&#39;m really grumpy <br/>\nat him, instead of just letting him know WHY it concerns me and asking him to <br/>\ndiscuss his plans before he leaves, and give us a chance to say it&#39;s not a <br/>\ngood time because we were planning to go somewhere as a family, or whatever <br/>\nit might be.  But I know a flexible agreement about the comings and goings of <br/>\na teenaged boy will last longer than an absolute set of rules and curfews and <br/>\nlimits.  Putting a big boy in a small box is an invitation for him to find a <br/>\nbigger box somewhere else.   But I learned that from having positive results <br/>\nfrom giving him more than usual freedom when he was four, and six...</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7398,"nextTopicId":7327}}
