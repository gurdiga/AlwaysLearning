One way of teaching is by using children&#39;s zone of proximal development. Teaching should begin toward the zone&#39;s upper limit, so that the child can reach the goal with help and move to a higher level of skill and knowledge. Enough assistance should be offered. The question &quot;What can I do to help you?&quot; has to be asked, or simply the child&#39;s intentions and attempts should be observed, so that the child can get enough support in a smooth way. When children hesitate, they have to be offered encouragement. Encouragement should be offered in such a way that the child can practice their skill. Another teaching strategy is to use more-skilled peers as teachers. It is important to remember though that teachers can be more-skilled children. The third strategy is to monitor and encourage children&#39;s use of private speech. The fourth strategy is to effectively assess the child&#39;s ZPD. Standardized tests are not the best way to assess children&#39;s learning. Another good strategy is to place instruction in a meaningful context. This means to use less abstract presentations of material but to let students experience more real-world setting. The last strategy is to transform the classroom with Vygotskian ideas. This means that key element of instruction in this program is the zone of proximal development.[1]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185586397,"authorName":"Lyla Wolfenstein","from":"&quot;Lyla Wolfenstein&quot; &lt;lylaw@...&gt;","profile":"lylawolf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Toddlers and Sharing- any comments?","postDate":"1247338894","msgId":46383,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENEOEY1RjdGQjJCQzQ5NkVBQURDODE4NEU1OTA4QkRCQExZTEFMQVAyPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEYyNjQ2QUE3LUFDNTYtNDVDNy1BMjAzLTE1OEVFNzlGNzM1NkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDM2NDRjMGIzMDkwNzEwMTQwOXc2Njc0ODY3NnZjYzMxMDIyZGU0YzdhZWVmQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8aDM4aWYxK2ZsNTJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDwxYmUwNDdmMDA5MDcxMDIzNThnNzA0ZWNmMTh3NjI2MmFmMDliNDc0Yjc2MEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPEQ5QjMxQTYyLTIxNkMtNEMyMS04N0ZCLUVEMTAzMkYwOUI5MEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4gPDRBNThDMjNCLjQwMzAzMDhAbWFjLmNvbT4gPDM5MTE1OC43MDk3OC5xbUB3ZWIxMTExMDMubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPiA8RjI2NDZBQTctQUM1Ni00NUM3LUEyMDMtMTU4RUU3OUY3MzU2QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46382,"nextInTopic":46384,"prevInTime":46382,"nextInTime":46384,"topicId":46347,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Lower limit of ZPD is the level of skill reached by the child working independently. The upper limit is the level of additional responsibility the child can accept with the assistance of an able instructor. The ZPD captures the child&#39;s cognitive skills that are in the process of maturing and can be accomplished only with the assistance of a more-skilled person. Scaffolding is a concept closely related to the idea of ZPD. Scaffolding is changing the level of support. Over the course of a teaching session, a more-skilled person adjusts the amount of guidance to fit the child&#39;s current performance. Dialogue is an important tool of this process in the zone of proximal development. In a dialogue unsystematic, disorganized, and spontaneous concepts of a child are met with the more systematic, logical and rational concepts of the skilled helper.[1]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Lyla<br/>\n  Recent Activity<br/>\n    a..  11New Members<br/>\n    b..  1New Links<br/>\n  Visit Your Group <br/>\n  Give Back<br/>\n  Yahoo! for Good<br/>\n<br/>\n  Get inspired<br/>\n<br/>\n  by a good cause.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Y!

I think she had a fear that if she didn&#39;t seize<br/>\n&gt; the opportunity to play with it when someone else had it that she&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; not get to. After positive experiences she easily grasped that that<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t so.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is also a brain development stage, though. You cannot persuade a <br/>\nkid that things have &quot;permanence&quot; until their brain has developed the <br/>\nability to grasp the concept. There are some fun little Piagetan <br/>\nexperiments you can do with little children that help parents understand <br/>\nthat you cannot force a child to understand something that their brain <br/>\nisn&#39;t capable of understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, if your child is under 13 to 15 months old, they probably <br/>\ndon&#39;t recognize that they are looking at themselves when they look in a <br/>\nmirror. Try this - use some paint or lipstick or something and put a <br/>\nbright red dot on their nose. Have them look in a mirror right before <br/>\nyou do it and then right after. When they are younger, they&#39;ll notice <br/>\nthe red nose and point to the nose in the mirror and laugh. Do this once <br/>\na month or so - suddenly, one time, they&#39;ll reach toward their OWN nose <br/>\n(not the one in the mirror) and indicate that they realize that red nose <br/>\nis on themselves - not just a face in the mirror. It is VERY obvious <br/>\nthat a change in the brain has taken place.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same kind of development happens with object permanence. It is why <br/>\npeek-a-boo is fun for children. There is an age at which things that are <br/>\nout of sight are considered gone and an age where they know that <br/>\nsomething covered up is still there. As they are developing into the <br/>\nlatter stage, they take delight in discovering, over and over, that <br/>\nsomething can still be there when they can&#39;t see it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Toddlers and Sharing- any comments?","postDate":"1247335954","msgId":46377,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE4QjJGNTMwLUVGNzctNDVGNi04NzBBLUQ3REY1RTk1MDAwREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDE3NGRmOWRjMDkwNzExMTAyOXM1Y2I5ZTYyYmk5ODdiZGFhY2QzNWVlOTczQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDM2NDRjMGIzMDkwNzEwMTQwOXc2Njc0ODY3NnZjYzMxMDIyZGU0YzdhZWVmQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8aDM4aWYxK2ZsNTJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDwxYmUwNDdmMDA5MDcxMDIzNThnNzA0ZWNmMTh3NjI2MmFmMDliNDc0Yjc2MEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPEQ5QjMxQTYyLTIxNkMtNEMyMS04N0ZCLUVEMTAzMkYwOUI5MEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4gPDRBNThDMjNCLjQwMzAzMDhAbWFjLmNvbT4gPDE3NGRmOWRjMDkwNzExMTAyOXM1Y2I5ZTYyYmk5ODdiZGFhY2QzNWVlOTczQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46376,"nextInTopic":46379,"prevInTime":46376,"nextInTime":46378,"topicId":46347,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- Sharing is one instance where adults demand much more of children than of themselves!

I think a lot of parents expect children to share with other children that they barely know and I think children are protective over their things and do not know the other child well enough to know if they are going treat their toy nicely. I know with my girls when I come across the sharing situation I ask them if they have a toy that they wouldn&#39;t mind playing with and if they do can they go and get it for them. I know with myself I am weary when someone new comes into my house and touches things that I are valuable to me because I really do not know the person. I try to prepare my children when someone new is coming over and ask them if they want to put up the things that they do not want others to play with. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I agree if it is done with tears it is not sharing. If the children are young then maybe have a variety of toys out and put up the one that you know your child values over the other toys.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrenda<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nProud momma of 3 amazing girls.

However, I don�t see a lot of options on how to deal<br/>\ncreatively when the issue is happening (reactive). Also, it came up to me<br/>\nthat my daughter has now a strong sense of ownership, she is saying more the<br/>\nwords �it is mine� or �it�s my turn�. Maybe this is a reflection of me<br/>\ntelling her �this toy is not yours� when she grabs the toy from the other<br/>\nchild�  lol.<br/>\nC.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sat, Jul 11, 2009 at 12:47 PM, Pam Sorooshian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On 7/11/2009 4:30 AM, Joyce Fetteroll wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; One thing I did was reassure my daughter (when we were at a community<br/>\n&gt; &gt; place where the toys belonged to the place) was that the other child<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t take the toy home, it would be there waiting for her when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the child was done. I think she had a fear that if she didn&#39;t seize<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the opportunity to play with it when someone else had it that she&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not get to. After positive experiences she easily grasped that that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t so.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is also a brain development stage, though. You cannot persuade a<br/>\n&gt; kid that things have &quot;permanence&quot; until their brain has developed the<br/>\n&gt; ability to grasp the concept. There are some fun little Piagetan<br/>\n&gt; experiments you can do with little children that help parents understand<br/>\n&gt; that you cannot force a child to understand something that their brain<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t capable of understanding.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For example, if your child is under 13 to 15 months old, they probably<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t recognize that they are looking at themselves when they look in a<br/>\n&gt; mirror. Try this - use some paint or lipstick or something and put a<br/>\n&gt; bright red dot on their nose. Have them look in a mirror right before<br/>\n&gt; you do it and then right after. When they are younger, they&#39;ll notice<br/>\n&gt; the red nose and point to the nose in the mirror and laugh. Do this once<br/>\n&gt; a month or so - suddenly, one time, they&#39;ll reach toward their OWN nose<br/>\n&gt; (not the one in the mirror) and indicate that they realize that red nose<br/>\n&gt; is on themselves - not just a face in the mirror. It is VERY obvious<br/>\n&gt; that a change in the brain has taken place.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The same kind of development happens with object permanence. It is why<br/>\n&gt; peek-a-boo is fun for children. There is an age at which things that are<br/>\n&gt; out of sight are considered gone and an age where they know that<br/>\n&gt; something covered up is still there. As they are developing into the<br/>\n&gt; latter stage, they take delight in discovering, over and over, that<br/>\n&gt; something can still be there when they can&#39;t see it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -pam<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":301108410,"authorName":"Marina DeLuca-Howard","from":"Marina DeLuca-Howard &lt;delucahoward@...&gt;","profile":"matedgirl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Toddlers and Sharing- any comments?","postDate":"1247333627","msgId":46374,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3NGRmOWRjMDkwNzExMTAzM3M3MjYyY2M1NXliMWZhNzRkMTBkZmQwNjdmQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE3NGRmOWRjMDkwNzExMTAyOXM1Y2I5ZTYyYmk5ODdiZGFhY2QzNWVlOTczQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDM2NDRjMGIzMDkwNzEwMTQwOXc2Njc0ODY3NnZjYzMxMDIyZGU0YzdhZWVmQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgkgPGgzOGlmMStmbDUyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgkgPDFiZTA0N2YwMDkwNzEwMjM1OGc3MDRlY2YxOHc2MjYyYWYwOWI0NzRiNzYwQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgkgPEQ5QjMxQTYyLTIxNkMtNEMyMS04N0ZCLUVEMTAzMkYwOUI5MEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4JIDw0QTU4QzIzQi40MDMwMzA4QG1hYy5jb20+CSA8MTc0ZGY5ZGMwOTA3MTExMDI5czVjYjllNjJiaTk4N2JkYWFjZDM1ZWU5NzNAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":46373,"nextInTopic":46375,"prevInTime":46373,"nextInTime":46375,"topicId":46347,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Just to add...if the nice policeman who I reported the theft to told me to have some sympathy for the poor guy because he is an addict or poor I would be","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-184017143\">Just to add...if the nice policeman who I reported the theft to told me to<br/>\nhave some sympathy for the poor guy because he is an addict or poor I would<br/>\nbe pretty mad.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when my kids complained about someone taking something from them I<br/>\ntreated this seriously and made sure everyone understood sharing is not<br/>\nsharing unless it is consensual!

You cannot persuade a <br/>\nkid that things have &quot;permanence&quot; until their brain has developed the <br/>\nability to grasp the concept. There are some fun little Piagetan <br/>\nexperiments you can do with little children that help parents understand <br/>\nthat you cannot force a child to understand something that their brain <br/>\nisn&#39;t capable of understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, if your child is under 13 to 15 months old, they probably <br/>\ndon&#39;t recognize that they are looking at themselves when they look in a <br/>\nmirror. Try this - use some paint or lipstick or something and put a <br/>\nbright red dot on their nose. Have them look in a mirror right before <br/>\nyou do it and then right after. When they are younger, they&#39;ll notice <br/>\nthe red nose and point to the nose in the mirror and laugh. Do this once <br/>\na month or so - suddenly, one time, they&#39;ll reach toward their OWN nose <br/>\n(not the one in the mirror) and indicate that they realize that red nose <br/>\nis on themselves - not just a face in the mirror. It is VERY obvious <br/>\nthat a change in the brain has taken place.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same kind of development happens with object permanence. It is why <br/>\npeek-a-boo is fun for children. There is an age at which things that are <br/>\nout of sight are considered gone and an age where they know that <br/>\nsomething covered up is still there. As they are developing into the <br/>\nlatter stage, they take delight in discovering, over and over, that <br/>\nsomething can still be there when they can&#39;t see it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Toddlers and Sharing- any comments?","postDate":"1247330051","msgId":46371,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRBNThCRjAzLjEwNzAwMDNAbWFjLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDFiZTA0N2YwMDkwNzEwMjM1OGc3MDRlY2YxOHc2MjYyYWYwOWI0NzRiNzYwQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDM2NDRjMGIzMDkwNzEwMTQwOXc2Njc0ODY3NnZjYzMxMDIyZGU0YzdhZWVmQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8aDM4aWYxK2ZsNTJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDwxYmUwNDdmMDA5MDcxMDIzNThnNzA0ZWNmMTh3NjI2MmFmMDliNDc0Yjc2MEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":46370,"nextInTopic":46372,"prevInTime":46370,"nextInTime":46372,"topicId":46347,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Does any one have any comments<br/>\nabout it? I am all ears.  ====<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIn that situation, I would have sat back and observed the situation.  If I<br/>\nam watching two children, and one child relinquishes a toy to another who<br/>\njoined in playing with the toy, I do not interfere, regardless of which of<br/>\nthe children in the situation is mine.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAs you described it, the boy gave up the toy by choice, and your daughter<br/>\ndid not take the toy by force.  There was no reason for you to interfere.<br/>\nThe real problem in this situation is not between two children, but rather<br/>\nthan between you and your daughter.  You took a toy away from her, and you<br/>\nowe her a big apology.  No matter what your reasoning was, you were modeling<br/>\nsome very bad behavior.  Children notice your actions more than your words,<br/>\nespecially toddlers.  You showed your daughter that if you are bigger you<br/>\ncan take a toy away from someone even if she is not done playing with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAs to whether you should let children resolve conflict on their own - that<br/>\ndepends.  It always depends on the situation and the children.  Sometimes<br/>\nkids can come up with a solution that works for both of them that we may<br/>\nnever have thought of.  Sometimes both children think the solution is fair,<br/>\neven if the adults don&#39;t.  Sometimes when adults interfere they cause more<br/>\nproblems.  Sometimes, however, a child is not able to navigate a conflict on<br/>\nhis own and needs help.  It is almost always best to observe first before<br/>\nbecoming involved in the situation because if you interfere when you are not<br/>\nneeded, you may make it worse.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for sharing:  that is always a choice in our family.  No one is ever<br/>\nforced to share.  Forced sharing builds resentment.  Sharing should be a<br/>\njoyful experience which is surrounded by positive emotions.  If it is always<br/>\na happy experience, it will be more likely to occur with increasing<br/>\nfrequency.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nTina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Toddlers and Sharing- any comments?","postDate":"1247252595","msgId":46353,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDcyQTRGMkIxLUZENzEtNDQyMC04NUEwLUQ5MDFBQTM0Qjg0NUBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEZEOThFNjFFLTNEODctNDc1Mi04NDRELTZGNkEwMzY1M0U1RkBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDFiZTA0N2YwMDkwNzA5MjI1MWkxMTlhY2JmYXA0ZmM5N2Y3NmYzNmYzNjhkQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8RkQ5OEU2MUUtM0Q4Ny00NzUyLTg0NEQtNkY2QTAzNjUzRTVGQGNvbWNhc3QubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":46352,"nextInTopic":46354,"prevInTime":46352,"nextInTime":46354,"topicId":46347,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Cinira, it probably would have helped if I hadn t put this all in a you context!

I asked her to give the boy  <br/>\n&gt; his turn.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Turn taking is something ingrained from school, our parents, other  <br/>\npeople.

I&#39;d be mad at *you* for  <br/>\nputting another child&#39;s needs (where *was* his mother up until then?)  <br/>\nahead of my own. Validating my feelings when you were the one who  <br/>\ncaused me to feel that way is small comfort when I&#39;m 2 1/2.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaking something else more appealing might have worked if you had  <br/>\ndecided it was the other child&#39;s turn. There has to be something in it  <br/>\nfor your daughter to want to release the toy, and mom explaining that  <br/>\ntaking turns is what she ought to do just doesn&#39;t cut it!<br/>\n<br/>\nI say all of this from experience. I used to do exactly the same thing  <br/>\nwhen my daughter was little. I tried to make her look generous when  <br/>\nshe had no concept of it.

(I&#39;m listening to my neighbor&#39;s kids right now - 4  <br/>\nunder the age of 6 - &quot;resolving their issues.&quot; It always ends up with  <br/>\nsomeone hurt or crying until the parents step in to stop it. And  <br/>\nsometimes, they just ignore them.  Not good.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy only friend who advocated the &quot;let them work it out&quot; scenario  <br/>\nseemed to just let it be when her daughter knocked mine to the ground  <br/>\nor otherwise do something that seemed mean. Her daughter didn&#39;t know  <br/>\nhow else to act because her mother wasn&#39;t helping her to find other  <br/>\nways to handle her frustration. It persisted as they got older; we  <br/>\ndon&#39;t see much of them anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, older kids need help sometimes in resolving their issues.  <br/>\nLearning how to deal with situations is life-long learning. And some  <br/>\nkids need help more than others.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s a very mainstream way of looking at kids&#39; interactions.  <br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t jive well with unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin B.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":311108332,"authorName":"evawitsel","from":"&quot;evawitsel&quot; &lt;evawitsel@...&gt;","profile":"evawitsel","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Toddlers and Sharing- any comments?","postDate":"1247250526","msgId":46349,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGgzODE4dSt1dWZyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFiZTA0N2YwMDkwNzA5MjI1MWkxMTlhY2JmYXA0ZmM5N2Y3NmYzNmYzNjhkQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46347,"nextInTopic":46350,"prevInTime":46348,"nextInTime":46350,"topicId":46347,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

When they argue about taking turns with their toys (or about anything else, what to watch on tv etc.), I ask them if they can think of their own solution. If they can&#39;t, I&#39;ll ask some questions to find out what the problem is and make some suggestions for possible solutions.<br/>\nBut usually they find their own solutions and they are always a lot better/creative than anything that I would have thought of!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I waited for my daughter to play a little bit with<br/>\n&gt; the toy then I told her that she had her turn and that now was the boy&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; turn.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are lots of other solutions to this problem: give your daughter something you know she will like better, so she will drop the first toy, ask her friend if he would like to play with something else, ask them if they can play with the toy together, sit down and play together with them etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Then I decided to<br/>\n&gt; open her fingers so I could give the toy to the boy.

I find that when I give them some time to hand over what they took from the other, they almost always do so. My 4 yo son is not as good at this as my daughter. So sometimes I offer my 2,5 yo daughter other fun options, because I know my son will not give up the toys without a fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nEva</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":337025893,"authorName":"Cinira Longuinho","from":"Cinira Longuinho &lt;ciniravlonguinho@...&gt;","profile":"ciniravlonguinho","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Toddlers and Sharing- any comments?","postDate":"1247205063","msgId":46347,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFiZTA0N2YwMDkwNzA5MjI1MWkxMTlhY2JmYXA0ZmM5N2Y3NmYzNmYzNjhkQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":46349,"prevInTime":46346,"nextInTime":46348,"topicId":46347,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello, I have been reading this forum for a few months now.

I really enjoy it and I<br/>\nam learning a lot. So, thank you!<br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to hear some comments about toddlers and sharing. I have a 2<br/>\n1/2 year old girl.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday we were at a friends house and my friends son soon started playing<br/>\nwith a big toy. My daughter got curious with the toy and went to the front<br/>\nof the toy and started playing with it... the boy step aside and kept only<br/>\nwatching her... He does not really speak. He is 2 years old. So he was sad<br/>\nbut did not do anything. I waited for my daughter to play a little bit with<br/>\nthe toy then I told her that she had her turn and that now was the boy&#39;s<br/>\nturn. She started crying and saying no, no... and would hold a part of the<br/>\nbig toy very tight. I said I could see she really wanted to play and that<br/>\nshe would after the boy had his turn. I asked her to give the boy his turn.<br/>\nShe said no, no, no...Of course, she got really angry. Then I decided to<br/>\nopen her fingers so I could give the toy to the boy. I gave the toy to the<br/>\nboy.  Then the boy&#39;s mother came and said that I should not interfere...to<br/>\nlet the kids resolve the issue by themselves. My daughter was crying so I<br/>\nheld her and told her I knew it was hard to share and that I could see she<br/>\nwas really mad ... I tried to validate all her feelings. She started rubbing<br/>\nher eyes and asked to take her nap... so I went upstairs and stayed with her<br/>\nuntil she fell asleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my way home I was thinking about my friends suggestion to just let the<br/>\nkids resolve the issue by themselves... Does any one have any comments about<br/>\nit?
