In my  <br/>\nstate, private schools (which is what we are) do not have to keep any  <br/>\nacademic records or follow any curriculum or do any assessing or  <br/>\ntesting. HSLDA lawyers have  provided such academic records to  <br/>\ngovernment officials because they are acting in what they, as the  <br/>\nattorneys of a specific family, feel is best for that particular  <br/>\nfamily. It is a bit like plea bargaining. Unfortunately, it sets up  <br/>\nthe rest of us to have the same demands made on us. Lawyers who  <br/>\nrepresent specific clients have to consider what&#39;s best for those  <br/>\nclients - that can be and often is a conflict of interest with what is  <br/>\ngood for homeschoolers, in general. Also, HSLDA used to not support  <br/>\nunschooling at all - memberships were rejected if you admitted not  <br/>\nusing a curriculum. They&#39;ve become more &quot;enlightened&quot; and they accept  <br/>\nunschoolers (usually called &quot;delight-driven homeschoolers&quot; in the  <br/>\nfundamentalist Christian community) but they very much urge all  <br/>\nhomeschoolers to use a curriculum, keep records, do testing, etc.,  <br/>\nbecause it makes mounting a legal defense easier.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Despite what unfortunate things happen to public school students and  <br/>\n&gt; the results that they put out does not mean that we will be able to  <br/>\n&gt; hold our right to home educate our children. There are people  <br/>\n&gt; working to take away that right daily and we have to fight to keep  <br/>\n&gt; it or we will not have a choice in what our children do.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No - that&#39;s much too strong a statement to be true. I don&#39;t think  <br/>\nthere are people anywhere working &quot;daily&quot; to try to take away our  <br/>\nability to homeschool. In my state, I don&#39;t think there is really  <br/>\nanybody working at all to take away that right - not anymore. Our  <br/>\ngovernor supports it, our state superintendent of public instruction  <br/>\nsupports it, our legislature supports it, and our court system  <br/>\nsupports it. The teachers unions don&#39;t support it, but they are not  <br/>\nactively working against it, either - they have bigger fish to fry  <br/>\nthese days.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome states are way easier to unschool in freely than others. Some  <br/>\ncountries are pretty much impossible. We all do what we have to do to  <br/>\nkeep ourselves and our families safe from legal problems that might  <br/>\ninterfere with carrying on our happy lives. For unschoolers, that  <br/>\nmeans protecting our children as much as we can from &quot;academic&quot;  <br/>\nreporting demands.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The testing is the less of the two evils... and just because they  <br/>\n&gt; are required in most states doesn&#39;t mean that people do them. Or  <br/>\n&gt; even register as homeschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Testing is not required in most states. I believe the only states in  <br/>\nwhich it is required are: Arkansas, Georgia (not submitted), Minnesota  <br/>\n(not submitted), New York, North Carolina, Oregon, and South Dakota.   <br/>\nPennsylvania and Washington also have testing requirements unless you  <br/>\nwork with a credentialed teacher. Testing is an option in other  <br/>\nstates, but there are legal alternatives.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know we&#39;d rather talk more about learning and less about the  <br/>\nlegalities here - my point in delving in a little has to do with  <br/>\nfocusing on clear thinking and good information. I think those are  <br/>\nimportant ingredients in a good unschooling home and something worth  <br/>\nstriving for. Question Everything!

My family has not<br/>\nregistered so how could we be included in such a stat? Anyway, I would<br/>\nimagine that many/most unschoolers would look to lists such as<br/>\nAlwaysLearning for discussion and ideas, yet there are &lt; 2000 members on the<br/>\nlargest unschooling lists. If each member on the list represents 2, 3, or<br/>\neven 5 kids then there are still more than a quarter million unschoolers<br/>\nunaccounted for. I&#39;m interested in hearing any thoughts on these stats. How<br/>\nmany unschoolers are there?<br/>\n<br/>\n~Dan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41106,"nextTopicId":41119}}
