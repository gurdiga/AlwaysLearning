I couldn&#39;t figure out why it wasn&#39;t being talked about  <br/>\nEVERYWHERE - it is so wonderful - enjoyable on so many levels and so  <br/>\nmuch food for thought and conversation! I didn&#39;t realize it had had  <br/>\nsuch a small release - only 27 theaters in the whole country on 9/14.  <br/>\nSo, when I read Sandra&#39;s post, I wondered about the release schedule  <br/>\nand I looked it up.<br/>\n<br/>\n********The film received its world premiere on Monday September 10,  <br/>\n2007 at the Toronto Film Festival. The film was then given a very  <br/>\nlimited &quot;platform release&quot; on 27 screens in the US on Friday  <br/>\nSeptember 14. The film had the second-highest &quot;per-screen&quot; average on  <br/>\nits opening weekend. In the following weeks, the release was  <br/>\nexpanded, with the second week of release expanding to 276 locations  <br/>\nin select regions. [3]. The film is scheduled to go into broad  <br/>\ngeneral release in the U.S. on October 12.[6]********<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve seen it multiple times - will be first in line to buy the DVD  <br/>\nwhen it comes out, and we&#39;ve been listening to the soundtrack of the  <br/>\nmovie AND to the original Beatles&#39; songs, over and over and over. I  <br/>\nam surprised at how much I like the covers of the original songs -  <br/>\nI&#39;d have thought I&#39;d have been a Beatles purist &lt;G&gt; but they do a  <br/>\nreally good job on the songs in the movie and I am enjoying listening  <br/>\nto them. A lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really taken by the movie - it so perfectly captured the tone of  <br/>\nthe times - in a very artistic sense. It all seemed to me to evoke  <br/>\nexactly the way the world sort of &quot;felt&quot; to me in those days. These  <br/>\nwere my high school years.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has been my favorite year for movies in a long time -  <br/>\n&quot;Stardust,&quot; &quot;Hairspray,&quot; and now &quot;Across the Universe&quot; - three great  <br/>\nmovies one right after another!

It&#39;s still<br/>\n&gt; not in full release, but will be next week. It&#39;s an art film in the<br/>\n&gt; finest sense, and it&#39;s a musical but not in the classic way, and it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; a period drama with good attention to physicalities, and the<br/>\n&gt; characters are either likable or trippy or both. It&#39;s a picture of a<br/>\n&gt; slice of the 60&#39;s showing a connectedness between the U.K. and the<br/>\n&gt; U.S. (or probably more like the suggestion that the same thoughts<br/>\n&gt; were being thought in the whole English speaking world).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are some pieces of art my kids have had as desktops or<br/>\n&gt; screensavers--paintings that show names of bands, in pictures, or<br/>\n&gt; movie titles. They&#39;re very intricate puzzles, kind of--&quot;find the<br/>\n&gt; picture&quot; but much more. This is a little like that. In any moment,<br/>\n&gt; in the film, there might be reference to several things, in what&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; shown, the music that&#39;s played and the way it&#39;s done, and musically<br/>\n&gt; there&#39;s something wonderful about it too, in the concept.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Younger kids probably would have no interest because it&#39;s hard to<br/>\n&gt; follow, though on DVD at home it wouldn&#39;t be so bad, because they<br/>\n&gt; could come for whatever they thought were the good parts and ignore<br/>\n&gt; the rest. Those my age who have Viet Nam sensitivities might want to<br/>\n&gt; wait for DVD too. It&#39;s not too bad, but some who&#39;ve had loved ones<br/>\n&gt; in in stupid wars might be warned.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dance! There are some choreographed large-group dance moments, and<br/>\n&gt; Holly was able to name off references to choreography in other movie<br/>\n&gt; musicals, so those will be fun for those with that knowledge.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My biggest concern is that now some people will have heard Beatles<br/>\n&gt; songs in cover before hearing the originals, but that&#39;s already<br/>\n&gt; happening from things like the Cirque de Soleil musical and the Black<br/>\n&gt; and White album. But never hearing the originals at all would be<br/>\n&gt; rough. &quot;Hold Me Tight&quot; wasn&#39;t available on Playlist, but I have Meet<br/>\n&gt; the Beatles on vinyl (both my original 60&#39;s copy and a replacement I<br/>\n&gt; bought in the 70&#39;s because the first was so worn), so I was able to<br/>\n&gt; play it for Holly in moments.

It&#39;s still  <br/>\nnot in full release, but will be next week.  It&#39;s an art film in the  <br/>\nfinest sense, and it&#39;s a musical but not in the classic way, and it&#39;s  <br/>\na period drama with good attention to physicalities, and the  <br/>\ncharacters are either likable or trippy or both.  It&#39;s a picture of a  <br/>\nslice of the 60&#39;s showing a connectedness between the U.K. and the  <br/>\nU.S. (or probably more like the suggestion that the same thoughts  <br/>\nwere being thought in the whole English speaking world).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some pieces of art my kids have had as desktops or  <br/>\nscreensavers--paintings that show names of bands, in pictures, or  <br/>\nmovie titles. They&#39;re very intricate puzzles, kind of--&quot;find the  <br/>\npicture&quot; but much more.   This is a little like that.  In any moment,  <br/>\nin the film, there might be reference to several things, in what&#39;s  <br/>\nshown, the music that&#39;s played and the way it&#39;s done, and musically  <br/>\nthere&#39;s something wonderful about it too, in the concept.<br/>\n<br/>\nYounger kids probably would have no interest because it&#39;s hard to  <br/>\nfollow, though on DVD at home it wouldn&#39;t be so bad, because they  <br/>\ncould come for whatever they thought were the good parts and ignore  <br/>\nthe rest.  Those my age who have Viet Nam sensitivities might want to  <br/>\nwait for DVD too.  It&#39;s not too bad, but some who&#39;ve had loved ones  <br/>\nin  in stupid wars might be warned.<br/>\n<br/>\nDance!  There are some choreographed large-group dance moments, and  <br/>\nHolly was able to name off references to choreography in other movie  <br/>\nmusicals, so those will be fun for those with that knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy biggest concern is that now some people will have heard Beatles  <br/>\nsongs in cover before hearing the originals, but that&#39;s already  <br/>\nhappening from things like the Cirque de Soleil musical and the Black  <br/>\nand White album.  But never hearing the originals at all would be  <br/>\nrough.  &quot;Hold Me Tight&quot; wasn&#39;t available on Playlist, but I have Meet  <br/>\nthe Beatles on vinyl (both my original 60&#39;s copy and a replacement I  <br/>\nbought in the 70&#39;s because the first was so worn), so I was able to  <br/>\nplay it for Holly in moments.  Not every mom has all the Beatles  <br/>\nalbums along with the memory of buying them new.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to use and share that page.  It won&#39;t be a permanent thing,  <br/>\nbecause Project Playist is a fluxxy deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31097,"nextTopicId":31098}}
