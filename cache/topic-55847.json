Here&#39;s my Cliff Notes version:<br/>\n-Self-esteem programs INCREASE aggressive behavior of youth at risk. <br/>\n-College students who kept gratitude journals regularly (but not daily I think) seemed to become happier, more optimistic, and got sick less often. <br/>\n-Up to 15 months babies learn the names for objects much easier if you wiggle the object while saying the name. <br/>\n-Babies gain vocabulary faster when parents pay more attention to what the baby is looking at than what the word sounds like when trying to figure out new speech<br/>\n-In cultures in which spanking is seen as totally normal for kids, kids who are spanked are much less likely to exhibit more violent behavior than their peers<br/>\n-Teen brain scans show that they actually consider doing horribly uncomfortable things when asked. While they usually say no just like adults, it&#39;s not because of a visceral reaction like the adults had, because they don&#39;t have enough experience yet to FEEL it<br/>\n-The teen need for autonomy is higher at 11 than 18, and peaks around 14-15<br/>\n-Telling a kid The Boy Who Cried Wolf doesn&#39;t usually decrease lying. Telling the George Washington & cherry tree story (role model who will not lie) usually does. The fact that that story appears to be a lie was not discussed. :)<br/>\n-Some 3 and most 4 year olds lie<br/>\n-In 1 study, the teens who lied the least were the ones with just a few rules in a few areas of their life, which were consistent and openly discussed in the context of a warm relationship <br/>\n-The change in attention span for kids who got one hour less versus one hour extra sleep is greater than the gap between the average 4th and 6th graders<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s more of course. I&#39;m sure I goofed something, and I can&#39;t give you the research that these assertions came from. But that&#39;s at least 2/3 of what interested me about the book. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlex<br/>\nmama to Katya</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] a world of bullshit  (long; large world of bullshit)","postDate":"1278894246","msgId":55882,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkwNTgzMC44MTIwNy5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDgubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDBFNkEwNjY2LUM5NDEtNERFMy1CMDgzLTZCQjI4OUM3MDZDM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDBFNkEwNjY2LUM5NDEtNERFMy1CMDgzLTZCQjI4OUM3MDZDM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":55859,"nextInTopic":55891,"prevInTime":55881,"nextInTime":55883,"topicId":55847,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***One is taking a long time because it bothers me a lot.

If anyone remembers where that request to  <br/>\ndiscus it was, I could go there, later, when I&#39;m through it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reader is doing a bad job of reading.  He wrote it.  Still, his  <br/>\nvoice is painful because he&#39;s using a sing-song with high-pitched  <br/>\nemphasis.  I hope he doesn&#39;t talk to his own child that way, but I&#39;m  <br/>\nguessing he does.   Can&#39;t say it &quot;monotonous,&quot; because musically  <br/>\nspeaking, it&#39;s all over the place.  But it&#39;s like the same irritating  <br/>\nbird call over and over and over.   So I should say that I&#39;m pre- <br/>\nirritated, and I don&#39;t want to pay for the book in hard copy just so I  <br/>\ncan get through it more quickly.  Then it will be sitting in my house  <br/>\nlike a brick.  I might get the paperback used, later, for marking  <br/>\npassages, or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s what I wrote down to share, though.  This is about research on  <br/>\nyoung children.  These phrases were used without shame or amusement,  <br/>\nas though they made a great deal of sense and were worthy of deep  <br/>\nthought:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;preschoolers&#39; EF capability&quot;<br/>\n&quot;attentional focus&quot;<br/>\n&quot;cognitive control&quot; (defined as &quot;when the brain has to manipulate  <br/>\ninformation in the mind&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat the hell!?<br/>\nThe emperor is wearing and breathing a bunch of hooey!  It&#39;s not real  <br/>\ncommunication.  Can those medical-sounding latinate terms be  <br/>\ntranslated into plain real English?!<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, &quot;EF capability&quot; is &quot;executive function capability,&quot; which  <br/>\nphrase alone is wordy word word for doey-do-do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll those quoted phrases above are about learning and thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list is about learning and thinking.  We&#39;re not wiring any kids  <br/>\nup, or having them prove they can (or can&#39;t) associate a picture on a  <br/>\ncomputer of a flower with their right, and a heart with their left (or  <br/>\nthe other way around).  We&#39;re not doing catscans on them while they  <br/>\n&quot;manipulate information.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI will stop and show you a different kind of treatment of learning,  <br/>\nthinking and English:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBelow is something Joyce Fetteroll wrote in the discussion about toy  <br/>\nguns.    It is not bullshit.  It&#39;s in plain English.  It&#39;s based on  <br/>\ndirect experience and years of association with other people, of being  <br/>\nobservant, of thinking and of learning.  If you want to re-read it as  <br/>\na contrast to the phrases above, you&#39;ll see the beauty in plain  <br/>\nEnglish, and maybe understand a little better why I don&#39;t want people  <br/>\nusing any initials or jargon on this list:<br/>\n<br/>\n(Joyce, from here to the end)<br/>\n<br/>\n====================<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen these gun and TV and sugar discussions come up I suspect it reads<br/>\nto some people like the unschoolers have different values. It&#39;s easy<br/>\nto allow your kids to play with (toy) guns and eat Fritos if you don&#39;t<br/>\nbelieve those are dangerous.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut one of the goals of unschooling is creating an environment where<br/>\nour kids can play around with ideas and decide what&#39;s right for them.<br/>\nPart of creating that environment is how parents can prevent their own<br/>\nbeliefs from *interfering* with that process. Parents can&#39;t help but<br/>\ninfluence. Nor should they! But they should be aware of how powerful<br/>\ntheir influence is. Depending on a child&#39;s sensitivity, if beliefs<br/>\nfrom their parents are starting to make more sense, they can feel<br/>\nguilty and bad for having &quot;wrong&#39; thoughts. As they get deeper into<br/>\ndifferent beliefs that are feeling more right to them, they will trust<br/>\ntheir parents less. And -- this is huge if someone wants unschooling<br/>\nto work -- they can&#39;t bounce these new ideas off their parents to get<br/>\nmore input. They already know their thoughts are &quot;wrong&quot;. They already<br/>\nknow their parents want them not to see the right in those ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen parents impose their own beliefs -- even when they provide what<br/>\nthey&#39;re certain is good, solid information to support their beliefs --<br/>\nthey&#39;re doing what schools are doing: handing kids information to<br/>\naccept as right and true. They&#39;re doing what any propagandist does:<br/>\nproviding information meant to sway someone&#39;s emotions and thoughts<br/>\ntowards a particular conclusion.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut unschooling is about the messy process of trying on different<br/>\nideas like hundreds of different colored glasses to see what the world<br/>\nlooks like through them. They will layer glasses. They will toss some<br/>\naside after wearing them for a good while. Some won&#39;t even appeal so<br/>\nthey won&#39;t try. Every pair will have good points and bad points. The<br/>\nquestion they&#39;re always asking is, &quot;Is the good worth the bad?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey will create, as they will continue to create through out their<br/>\nlives, a unique collection of filters that feel right to them and<br/>\nclarify the world in a way that&#39;s meaningful to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne way to help parents avoid imposing strongly held beliefs is for<br/>\nthem to examine the foundation of beliefs *that interfere with<br/>\nchildren&#39;s exploration of beliefs.&quot; To examine what actually happens<br/>\nIN UNSCHOOLING FAMILIES where children are allowed to explore freely.<br/>\n(Not just any family where the philosophy of parents towards children<br/>\nis a big fat X of unknowable.)<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling parents *can* be anti-gun pacifists, non-sugar-eating<br/>\nvegetarians without creating an atmosphere where kids feel wrong for<br/>\ntrying on other beliefs.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut holding a belief that toy guns and playacting violence promote<br/>\nviolence *will* interfere. *And*, not only that, but it doesn&#39;t hold<br/>\nup to examination as the stories here indicate. I have yet to meet a<br/>\nchild who is respected for who he is, whose beliefs are respected, who<br/>\nacts violently. It&#39;s not guns or legs of lamb or candlesticks that<br/>\ncause violent desires but how people are treated by others.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the great things about playacting violence is being able to<br/>\nplay in a world that someone *doesn&#39;t* want to live in but is<br/>\ninterested in exploring to see what it&#39;s like living with different<br/>\nrules (different colored glasses). Living in a world where someone<br/>\nsolves problems with a gun means living in a world where *other*<br/>\npeople solve problems with guns. It&#39;s not a world where anyone can<br/>\npeacefully go to the park or relax in the evening to watch TV. Kids<br/>\ngrowing up in secure homes where they&#39;re respected for who they are<br/>\n(even if they like guns and eating meat!) don&#39;t have any desire to<br/>\nlive in a world like that. They&#39;d have to give up too many other<br/>\nbeautifully colored glasses to wear the &quot;solve problems by shooting<br/>\nproblem people&quot; glasses.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55857,"nextTopicId":55628}}
