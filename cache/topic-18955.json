Having our boys go to college was never a question for us; it was a matter of which high-powered East Coast school (or Stanford) they would go to. Then we started homeschooling our middle son and then our youngest, and then we started moving towards unschooling. My oldest ended up going to the local community college through a program where the district paid for it and then finished at a commuter campus of the state university and lived at home. By the end, he was really ready to be done with the hoop jumping and nonsense. We were able to leave it up to him as to whether he wanted to finish. He just graduated in June and is now unschooling. (Yes, it took us a while to get there.) He always made decisions of what he wanted to do and all the college choices were his, but it was hard for us to shift away from our expectations and we had to defend his choices to my parents. I am really glad that he has the degree but I think he would have been happier if he had gone to work last year, rather than finishing college. We have been doing attentive parenting or radical-unschooling-parenting with him, while he was in college and that worked out really well. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow my middle son is starting the same Running Start program in the fall and I am trying to get out of my college-driven mindset. I may need lots of smacks on the head. I am trying to make sure the he is taking what he wants and exploring whatever sounds interesting, rather than working towards a degree.  A full schedule is paid for and I want him to take advantage of that. But that is a controlling thought. I keep find myself having these kinds of thoughts. Like he should take a full schedule because it is paid for. And he needs to get good grades in the classes that he takes because it will be on his permanent transcript. They don&#39;t allow pass/fail in the program and he can&#39;t take classes there if he isn&#39;t in the program, since he is only 15. But I have to keep reminding myself that he doesn&#39;t have to get all As. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe totally wants to do this program and has tons of friends who are doing it and going to this school. Since he has been unschooling, I am afraid that he will have trouble jumping through their hoops and conforming to their rules. I can help him with that but want to do it because he wants it rather than because I want it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know some of you have had kids who went to college, any advice?<br/>\nJae<br/>\nRedmond, WA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: college","postDate":"1087030433","msgId":19857,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA4M0VFQUVDLUJDNEUtMTFEOC1CNzU2LTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDYuMC4wLjIyLjAuMjAwNDA2MTExOTU0MDIuMDMwMDJiMDBAc2hhd21haWwuZ3Yuc2hhd2NhYmxlLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDE5ZS4yNTVmMThiZS4yZGZiNDA5NUBhb2wuY29tPiA8Ni4wLjAuMjIuMC4yMDA0MDYxMTE5NTQwMi4wMzAwMmIwMEBzaGF3bWFpbC5ndi5zaGF3Y2FibGUubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":19856,"nextInTopic":36956,"prevInTime":19856,"nextInTime":19858,"topicId":18955,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Chris, the oldest, was always very academically ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1958089391\">In our family&#39;s experience the kids haven&#39;t had a very difficult time <br/>\nadjusting to taking college classes.  Chris, the oldest, was always very academically <br/>\noriented.  We had just returned from Okinawa, when he was eighteen, so he <br/>\nstarted community college full-time.  He absolutely loved it.  He said he felt so <br/>\n&quot;fresh&quot; compared to the other students.<br/>\n<br/>\nShawn, was next, and didn&#39;t go til he was nearly 21.  He had some difficulty <br/>\ntaking notes, but worked on it.  All of the kids are/were comfortable talking <br/>\nto their professors, so they asked for help and clarification when they needed <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth Devin and Donika started by taking just one or two classes as high <br/>\nschool students at the community class, so they eased into it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bottom line is that the kids went to college because they wanted to.  <br/>\nYes, there were a few adjustments, but they asked questions, and figured it out <br/>\nquickly.  As long as the desire to be there is personal, the self-motivation is <br/>\nthere too, and it works.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe what the kids have learned at home is to seek information.  Because <br/>\ntheir natural curiousity is still intact, it puts them in the fore-ground in <br/>\nthe college arena.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\nwww.homeschoolingreflections.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36899,"nextTopicId":36953}}
