I think attachment parenting has so many varied definitions, depending on where you look for information.  I also feel like following your child&#39;s cues/needs in terms of what to eat, when to sleep, how to help them when they are upset, etc. gets fuzzier (at least in the ap circles I&#39;m in) when it comes to toddlerhood.  I&#39;ve personally found the philosophies/ideas of unschooling very helpful in my day to day life with my toddler.  I also feel like coming to unschooling while he is so young (under 2) is preventing me from needing to let go or undo of some of my school think/talk from my old life as a &#39;student&#39; and &#39;teacher&#39; later on (I &#39;taught&#39; for 5 years).
