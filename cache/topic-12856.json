Then, flipping through channels one night, <br/>\nwe saw his show being previewed on E. Luckily, it was coming up next, so we <br/>\ndecided to watch it.

It was great watching <br/>\nthis kid and his go-get-em style. Not five minutes into it though, my hubby <br/>\nlooked at me and stated, &quot;This kid had to be homeschooled! I wonder if they <br/>\nunschooled.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI was suprised that the statement came from him first as I hadn&#39;t even <br/>\nthought about it much. I don&#39;t know why, perhaps because I spend a couple <br/>\nmore hours a day with the kids; but then again he has always supported and <br/>\nunderstood unschooling from the day I took them out of school and gleefully <br/>\nsaid we weren&#39;t ever doing &quot;curriculum&quot; again. I initially thought he might <br/>\nbe worried, but if he was, he never said so, only that he trusted me and knew <br/>\nour kids well enough to trust them too.
