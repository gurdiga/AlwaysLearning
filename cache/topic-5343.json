It&#39;s about 7X11 feet.  We left<br/>\n&gt;the posts long too, like 14 feet tall, and put the<br/>\n&gt;roof down at the appropriate height with the house<br/>\n&gt;roof.  That way we have more versatility to reuse the<br/>\n&gt;poles later.  They are really beefy, like 8 inches in<br/>\n&gt;diameter, so we should be able to get good use of them<br/>\n&gt;later as structural posts elsewhere.  It really<br/>\n&gt;changes the look of the mobile for the better.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Yesterday, while we were banging away on it and making<br/>\n&gt;a lot of noise, a family of a doe and two yearlings<br/>\n&gt;came mozeying by, eating the clover and blackberries<br/>\n&gt;about 10 feet away.

So here it is again, for everyone else who was<br/>\ninterested.  By the way, just FYI, the 20 acres<br/>\nadjoining our property with a view of Lake Leland<br/>\n(very nice parcel) is still for sale.  About 80,000.00<br/>\nI believe, from the same owner.

Now we<br/>\nhave one family who has sold their house and another<br/>\nwhich is in the process, but we didn&#39;t then.  I keep<br/>\nhoping, though, that some folks who want to have a<br/>\nsimilar and connected community to ours will buy it so<br/>\nwe can work together as two small villages.  The<br/>\nneighbors around the lake are fantastic, by the way. <br/>\nVery interested in what we are doing, suportive and<br/>\nopen minded.  There are also a number of other<br/>\nIntentional Communities on the Peninsula and in<br/>\nSeattle/Tacoma/Olympia and surrounding areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nLiza Sabater wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So how do you work out the legalities?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Communities all have different setups, depending on<br/>\nthe structure of the community, the local codes and<br/>\nstate laws.  In WA state (where we are) many CoHousing<br/>\ncommunities operate under &quot;outdoor condominium&quot; laws. <br/>\nComdominium laws means that each owner has separate<br/>\nlegal title to an individual dwelling unit and an<br/>\nundivided fractional interest in the common elements<br/>\nof the project as a whole.  When it comes time to move<br/>\nfor any reason, the individual is mainly responsible<br/>\nfor selling their own home, although the process<br/>\nvaries by community, and many communities opt to have<br/>\nfirst buyers rights in order to select a compatible<br/>\nnew owner.  Even if the homeowners are selling<br/>\nseperately, communities still have the right to some<br/>\nselection criteria (all are different, and some have<br/>\nmore than others.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMany other communities, ours included, operate under<br/>\nthe Cooperative Housing laws.  That means a member has<br/>\na membership in the cooperative corporation which in<br/>\nturn holds title to the entire project. Further,<br/>\nmembership in a cooperative housing corporation<br/>\nentitles its owner to the occupancy of a dwelling unit<br/>\nin the project. This right of occupancy is appurtenant<br/>\nto, and inseparable from, the membership interest in<br/>\nthe cooperative.  In our particular project, the<br/>\ndwelling units are to be space efficient, small<br/>\nnatural cottages in the woods, that are owner and<br/>\ncommunity built.  When it comes time to move, a<br/>\nmember/family sells their shares back to the community<br/>\nwho keep a fund for that purpose, and then they select<br/>\nand resell to new members.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How and by who was the land bought?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My husband and I bought the land on an owner held<br/>\ncontract.  We have no bank loan.  We paid $15,000.00<br/>\ndown and have slightly higher interest than market<br/>\nrate, but no bank to deal with.  The title holder<br/>\nholds the contract, and takes our payments through a<br/>\ntitle account with a local bank, which has certain<br/>\nlegal protections and insurance.  It is a common setup<br/>\nfor rural land.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How many families are in your village?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We bought the land this summer, and our family is, as<br/>\nyet, alone here.  We have spent several years working<br/>\ntowards this, and have a very solid plan for growth<br/>\nbased on our experiences with other communities and<br/>\nindividuals.  We are taking our time to grow the<br/>\ncommunity in a stable way.  We meet frequently and do<br/>\nprojects on the land with prospective members, have a<br/>\nmailing list to keep in touch with each other, and<br/>\ncorrespond regularly.  We were involved with members<br/>\nbefore we found this land.<br/>\n<br/>\nA family of 5 (unschooling, mom, dad, 14 y.o.d., 11<br/>\ny.o.s, and 5 y.o.d.) are planning to move in before<br/>\nthe end of the year.  Another couple (a female High<br/>\nSchool teacher, and her muscian partner) are in the<br/>\nbeginning<br/>\nstages of developing membership here.  She calls<br/>\nherself a &quot;plant in the system&quot; because of her<br/>\nunschooling and alternative beliefs.  A third family<br/>\n(unschooling mom, dad and 13 y.o.s.) are heavily<br/>\ninvolved in developing membership here.  A single guy<br/>\nfrom Texas is coming out to visit at the end of the<br/>\nmonth, to explore membership options for himself.  We<br/>\nare incontact with several other prospectives.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur process is to get to know each other through our<br/>\nvarious mediums; spend time working together on the<br/>\nland and doing other things together; move members<br/>\nonto the land on a trial basis for at least a year in<br/>\na temporary structure (such as movable small cabin,<br/>\nyurt or other); then formalize membership together<br/>\nlegally and emotionally (probably with some kind of<br/>\nshared non-religious ceremony to mark the commitment.)<br/>\n We have folks in various stages of this process.  Our<br/>\ngoal is to have about 5 member families here, a small<br/>\nvillage.  We are in contact with other nearby<br/>\ncommunities as well, and hope to function<br/>\ncooperatively with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinancially, trial members will pay a monthly &quot;rent&quot;<br/>\nper adult (about $200.00 each) and their portion of<br/>\nshared expenses, as well as purchase their own<br/>\ntemporary dwelling, unless we have one to offer later.<br/>\n The rent goes towards the land payment and is<br/>\nnon-refundable if they decide to leave.  If they stay,<br/>\nit can be counted towards their total investment<br/>\ncosts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do you have to sign in for a number of years?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, folks can leave at any time.  If they are<br/>\ninvested, then we would buy back their shares for<br/>\nresale later on.  If they are not yet invested, it is<br/>\neven easier.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How much is it to each family? Are the houses the<br/>\n&gt; same?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Cost for total investment has not yet been determined,<br/>\nand will depend on a number of factors.  We estimate,<br/>\nwith 5 families, cost will be about 20-30,000.00 total<br/>\nshare cost.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey also build their own cottages, but we use much<br/>\nnatural, onsite materials, found materials and free or<br/>\nlow cost recyclables in the building process.  The<br/>\ncottages will be owner/community built, and specific<br/>\nto each family&#39;s design.  They will include composting<br/>\ntoilets and a sink which is on a greywater recycling<br/>\nsystem.  They will contain small kitchenettes for<br/>\nprivate family meals and snacks when desired.  Other<br/>\namenities will vary by family, but overall size will<br/>\nremain small.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have broken ground and begun a foundation on a<br/>\npartially earth bermed studio cottage in a site my<br/>\nniece selected.  It will be mainly cob and natural<br/>\nalder and cedar posts cut on site (cob is sort of like<br/>\nclay/adobe - think those white washed cottages in the<br/>\nUK) with a green living roof.  She is 16, and will be<br/>\nmoving up here from California in the next year to<br/>\nlive in her cottage.  Hers will also include a shower<br/>\non a greywater system, at her request.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have selected a site and broken ground and begun to<br/>\ncut cedar poles for our own family&#39;s cottage.  We have<br/>\nposts and beams in place in concrete for a larger<br/>\nbuilding, which will serve as our community house<br/>\n(kitchen/dining/social/multi use space) when it is<br/>\ndone.  We are working on our bathhouse design,<br/>\ngardens, ponds and other features.  We have cleared a<br/>\nsite for group parking, to keep half the property as<br/>\npedestrian friendly, with capabilty to drive on it to<br/>\ndeliver heavy items, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently our family is living in the single wide,<br/>\nolder mobile home which was on the property.  As soon<br/>\nas we complete our initial cottage (a simple, one<br/>\nlarge room open design to begin with, to get it done<br/>\nquickly, which will be added to later for our<br/>\npermanent dwelling) this mobile will become our<br/>\ntemporary community house for a year or two, until our<br/>\npermanent community house is completed.  At that time,<br/>\nthis structure will be torn down and removed, to make<br/>\nmore space on this site for our extensive gardens.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis weekend we built a pole structure porch roof from<br/>\nalders (with bark and moss still in place) using all<br/>\nfound scrap (didn&#39;t buy a thing) for railing, brackets<br/>\nto hold the beams, hardware, roofing, etc.  It looks<br/>\nreally great, and we set the poles in such a way that<br/>\nthey can be reused later in another contruction when<br/>\nthis mobile goes away.  It&#39;s about 7X11 feet.  We left<br/>\nthe posts long too, like 14 feet tall, and put the<br/>\nroof down at the appropriate height with the house<br/>\nroof.  That way we have more versatility to reuse the<br/>\npoles later.  They are really beefy, like 8 inches in<br/>\ndiameter, so we should be able to get good use of them<br/>\nlater as structural posts elsewhere.  It really<br/>\nchanges the look of the mobile for the better.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday, while we were banging away on it and making<br/>\na lot of noise, a family of a doe and two yearlings<br/>\ncame mozeying by, eating the clover and blackberries<br/>\nabout 10 feet away.  The deer are so funny the way the<br/>\nignore us.  I left them a piece of the banana bread<br/>\nthat I made yesterday, but they were more interested<br/>\nin the blackberries.  I am sure something else will<br/>\neat it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, hope I answered your questions.  I gotta get<br/>\nto some chores, clean up, stack some wood for the<br/>\nwoodstove and work on our cottage site and plan.  Have<br/>\na great day!<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99944316,"authorName":"Nancy Wooton","from":"Nancy Wooton &lt;ikonstitcher@...&gt;","profile":"ikonstitcher","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Sigh, we went to a funeral last week","postDate":"1032796883","msgId":9545,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5QjQ4OEUyLjJBOUE5JWlrb25zdGl0Y2hlckBjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDIwOTIzMDQ1OTExLjkxNTg4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0MzA3Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":9544,"nextInTopic":9547,"prevInTime":9544,"nextInTime":9546,"topicId":5343,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

There is no one in France with<br/>\nthat name, left. One small family went to Spain, one<br/>\nto Switzerland, and <br/>\nNathaniel Varnedeaux and one child arrived in Georgia<br/>\nin 1701.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Mother called the Huegenots &#34;those Damned<br/>\nCalvanists&#34;. They were more stiff-necked than any<br/>\nCatholics ever were. <br/>\n<br/>\nI went to my Mother&#39;s brother&#39;s funeral, last<br/>\nWednesday. Aunt Martha woke me up on my birthday with<br/>\na phone call to tell me that Uncle Frank had just<br/>\ndied. Amazing. I haven&#39;t seen or spoken to her in 36<br/>\nyears, or any Rockwells, at all, in 24. I have sent<br/>\nthe occasional card and note. This had so touched her,<br/>\nthat she called me first. Who knew? My cousins were<br/>\ngrateful that my brother and Roy and I went to this<br/>\nfuneral. Surprised us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did ask Roy not to wear his skull and cross bones<br/>\nhelmet-liner to the actual funeral. He wore the<br/>\nlizard-skin looking one, instead. I saw him peaking<br/>\ninto the casket, at the viewing. He had told me he<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to see any dead guys, and I had told him<br/>\nhe didn&#39;t have to look if he didn&#39;t want to. But he<br/>\ndid.<br/>\n<br/>\nA little two and half girl-cousin latched onto Roy,<br/>\ncalling him My Boy. She wouldn&#39;t let anyone sit in any<br/>\nseats that Roy had occupied. She hugged and hugged him<br/>\nand held his hand. At the family gathering afterwards<br/>\n(at the orange grove, were I lived when I was little)<br/>\nRoy watched out for her. He saw a water moccasin just<br/>\nmoments after I had warned him about the snakes there,<br/>\nI saw it too. Ugly, fat one. And the alligators in the<br/>\nriver. <br/>\n<br/>\nRoy took pictures of a huge big nest in the top of a<br/>\ncypress tree. We didn&#39;t get to see if it was an egret<br/>\nor eagle&#39;s. I saw a black panther run through the yard<br/>\nthere, at the grove, when my little brothers and I<br/>\nwere playing on the porch (now enclosed and the yard<br/>\nis part of the grove)47 years ago.  It looked at us,<br/>\nso beautiful, ....Grandmother saw it too....then it<br/>\nran away, in a furtive sort of way. A few minutes<br/>\nlater two hunters on horseback with dogs rode up,<br/>\ntracking that cat. One of the last. They were really <br/>\nblack jaguars, not  panthers. If the light is right<br/>\nyou could see the spots. Grandmother shocked me by <br/>\nsaying we hadn&#39;t seen the black panther. I was glad,<br/>\nbut the dogs knew which way it went, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat used to be endless miles of palmetto and the<br/>\noccasional stand of pine is not anymore.

Oooh. Oh<br/>\nwell. Some others were so HAPPY that they hugged and<br/>\nkissed us.

There is<br/>\na modern resurgance in the last 30 years of the<br/>\nmovement internationally to create communities solely<br/>\nas a social change to create and sustain better lives.<br/>\n It began with counter cultural communes in the 70&#39;s,<br/>\nbut continues today with all types of communities. <br/>\nCommunes are identified by egalitarian principles<br/>\n(total income sharing) and often a shared ideology<br/>\nand/or faith.  They often have a charismatic<br/>\nfigurhead.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Intentional Communities are very much more than<br/>\ncommunes, which is only one specific type of<br/>\ncommunity, just like rye is one type of bread.  The<br/>\nmovement in this country is growing at a feverish<br/>\npace.  CoHousing is particularly big.  It is a Swedish<br/>\nconcept that Americans are embracing.  CoHousing is<br/>\nidentified by the &quot;balance the traditional advantages<br/>\nof home ownership with the benefits of shared common<br/>\nfacilities and ongoing connections with your<br/>\nneighbors&quot; as it says at the CoHousing Network<br/>\nHomepage.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cohousing.org/\">http://www.cohousing.org/</a>  This is a good<br/>\nresource for learning more about CoHousing and finding<br/>\ngroups, communities and individuals in your area.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Intentional Communities website <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ic.org/\">http://www.ic.org/</a><br/>\nis a great place for information too.

We are building a community<br/>\nwhich has a permaculture and natural/eclogical focus,<br/>\nbuilding small natural and sustainable cottages and<br/>\ngrowing organic food, recycling greywater and so<br/>\nforth.  We are committed to living in community and<br/>\nare also building a community house in which we can<br/>\nshare group meals as desired and get together in other<br/>\nways.  We are a continuum concept based village, with<br/>\nall unschoolers so far, non-religious or political,<br/>\nopen minded, and concensus based.  Other plans in the<br/>\nworks are a sweat lodge (designed by a Native American<br/>\nfamily who are deeply involved in their heritage); <br/>\nand a combined Bath House and Hot Tub, with an<br/>\nadjoining &quot;Garden Shed&quot; with snack area, indoor lounge<br/>\nand covered patio for busy gardeners to relax in.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are sort of a hybrid, not quite CoHousing, since<br/>\nmembers will not legally own their specific dwelling<br/>\nand the land it sits on.  Legally we are forming as a<br/>\nHousing Cooperative, with each person/family owning a<br/>\nshare of the total community, which includes their<br/>\ndwelling.  This means we get to buy back someone&#39;s<br/>\nshares who is leaving the community, and we choose who<br/>\nto resell to based on someone who is a good fit in the<br/>\ncommunity.  We are just getting started out here and<br/>\nplan not to exceed a smallish, extended family style<br/>\nvillage with a handfull of families.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope I answered the questions and provided the<br/>\ninformation requested.
