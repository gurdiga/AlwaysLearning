That justification of a window has more to do with  <br/>\norganization and with consistency (and visual conformity) than with  <br/>\nlearning itself.   I noticed as I was writing this that we&#39;re talking  <br/>\nJapan and Germany.  They both have reputations for being humorless  <br/>\nwith and controlling of children.  Perhaps it&#39;s an unfair stereotype;  <br/>\nperhaps it&#39;s as real as any genetic realities can be.  If it&#39;s not at  <br/>\nall genetic, perhaps there are traditions in those cultures that  <br/>\nothers find somewhat inflexible but they&#39;re accepted by those who  <br/>\ngrew up with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe press to have young girls play piano is with us still, even in  <br/>\nJapan now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there are some reasonable concerns with grown women  <br/>\n(especially young wives) being in the company of male teachers  <br/>\n(especially piano teachers who sit right next to them with all those  <br/>\nvibrations coming from the large, hard-bodied instrument).   <br/>\nSeriously.   Electronic pianos are much more safely unsexy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe prejudice about &quot;if you don&#39;t learn it when you&#39;re little you&#39;re   <br/>\nnot going to learn it at all&quot; is reinforced by compulsory attendance  <br/>\n(to 18 in many places; John Holt must be fidgeting in his grave, as  <br/>\nhe thought 15 and 16 were too late to hold young men down like  <br/>\nchildren).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe realities are different now, as to opportunities for learning, I  <br/>\nthink.  Life is easier for us than for great grandmothers who had to  <br/>\nhaul water and heat it over a fire to do laundry for men and teen  <br/>\nsons who were working in other people&#39;s fields all week.    That  <br/>\nwould be my own maternal grandmother, but I&#39;m older than most of  <br/>\nyou.  And some of you might never have had grandmothers who had to  <br/>\nhaul water to wash clothes.   I just have to get my clothes to the  <br/>\nwashing machine.  I don&#39;t even have to make my own soap.  I can play  <br/>\npiano all through the rinse cycle and never even get my hands wet.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo as usual, when considering questions like these, consider as much  <br/>\nas you can historically and geographically and socially to try to see  <br/>\nwhere the messages come from, and how the landscape is changing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":116488337,"authorName":"Gold Standard","from":"&quot;Gold Standard&quot; &lt;jacki@...&gt;","profile":"jackiknouse","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Re: not choosing books","postDate":"1208962543","msgId":34474,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHQ0VMTEFPQUQuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxMGYwMWM4YTUyNCQ1MDVjMjE4MCRmMTE0NjQ4MCRAZjJzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":34473,"nextInTopic":34475,"prevInTime":34473,"nextInTime":34475,"topicId":34421,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Often Simon will notice something that my word-centric perspective completely misses. When we lived in Japan, where I was completely illiterate, I found I looked for many different arenas for information. And Japan is amazingly well setup for the non-literate. In restaurants there are often models of the food that&#39;s on offer in the window so you can lead the waitress outside to point at what you want to eat (amid much giggling). The most difficult request I had to negotiate was for tampons. The poor woman was so embarrassed when I finally communicated to her my need. But that isn&#39;t the point.

The concept of reading was quite clear to him, I<br/>\nthink, and he definitely recognised its value. However, he did not read<br/>\nhimself until he was 12. Another daughter, 11, is now working hard on her<br/>\nreading skills; she was not that interested before.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI notice that kids, left to decide when to learn to read for themselves,<br/>\noften leave it till later - there is so much that is more important to them<br/>\nin their childhood. Reading is a bit abstract, a bit removed from real life.<br/>\nThey want to grasp hold of real life and experience it for themselves, and<br/>\nonly when they are full up and contented with this are they interested in<br/>\nreceiving it second-hand, through books. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople say that a child is losing out if he cannot read. I don&#39;t think so.<br/>\nLeft to decide for himself, a child is busy all day long - living and<br/>\nlearning. And then there are those lovely quiet snugly times when you read a<br/>\nbook together - if he can&#39;t read it for himself yet, there is no reason at<br/>\nall why he should lose out - you can give him the gift of your reading skill<br/>\nto use.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we lived in South Africa, we had a housekeeper in her 30&#39;s who could<br/>\nnot read. She did want to learn, and while working for me, did an adult<br/>\nreading course. However, although being able to read did add value to her<br/>\nlife, she had successfully functioned for all those years without the skill.<br/>\nShe was a nurturing mother of 8 children, a wonderful housekeeper, a super<br/>\nperson. She knew a lot about her environment, nature, folk remedies etc. She<br/>\ncould do her shopping, get from point A to point B, bake and cook... one is<br/>\ninclined to see illiteracy as a great handicap. However, she made a huge<br/>\ndifference to my life in the days when my children were little and my<br/>\nhusband was working far too hard, out of the country more than he was in it.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I do feel that reading is important, and yes, I do want my kids to<br/>\nlearn to read. But I think we place far too much value on the skill as<br/>\ncompared with other skills...<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThus say I, a confirmed book-aholic, who learned to read when I was 4!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRegards<br/>\n<br/>\nCathy<br/>\n<br/>\n.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://geo.yahoo.com/serv?s=97359714/grpId=4410250/grpspId=1705542111/msgId\">http://geo.yahoo.com/serv?s=97359714/grpId=4410250/grpspId=1705542111/msgId</a><br/>\n=34464/stime=1208926968/nc1=4025373/nc2=3848640/nc3=4763758&gt; <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":334634178,"authorName":"Cindy Fox","from":"&quot;Cindy Fox&quot; &lt;outreach@...&gt;","profile":"cindycindyfox","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: not choosing books","postDate":"1208937642","msgId":34467,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZ1bXFiYSttcGM1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZ1bWVwNStvZmQ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":34466,"nextInTopic":34468,"prevInTime":34466,"nextInTime":34468,"topicId":34421,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Sports anyone?  I was a genuine <br/>\nklutz as a kid and my only hope to get through gym was to befriend the <br/>\nteacher. :)  I sat and regaled my high school gym teacher with stories <br/>\nand held his clipboard and ran errands - ANYTHING to stay off that <br/>\nfield, court, track, whatever!  Any time I couldn&#39;t talk him out of <br/>\nkeeping me out of the game, it was like a mile long disconnect with <br/>\nwhat my brain saw, told my body, and my body reacting!  The ball was <br/>\nalways long gone when I swung at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I later worked at a college and my boss wanted everyone on the <br/>\nfaculty volleyball and softball team, I dreaded it but figured I could <br/>\nenjoy the sunshine, take up space and maybe block a ball or two.  But <br/>\ndespite his disappointment in my less than stellar performance, I <br/>\nimpressed myself when I realized that I had actually developed some <br/>\ncoordination!  I could actually see the ball and hit it. :)  Not that <br/>\nit went where I wanted, but I had improved by doing nothing...  It was <br/>\njust when my body was ready... <br/>\n<br/>\nIf only there were a little league for twenty-somethings! :(  Well, <br/>\nthere wasn&#39;t, so I went on to non-competitve sports, like SCUBA and <br/>\nSkiing.  I never became an expert, but I finally got enjoyment out of <br/>\nsomething physical...  Something I had learned to accept that I <br/>\nwas &#39;bad&#39; at and had stopped trying until that fluke.  BTW, thanks <br/>\nalso in part to him, I later became a SCUBA instructor and certified <br/>\nthat boss to dive after starting a program at the college. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI never got very good at eye-hand coordination at activities requiring <br/>\nspeed. :) My body still primarily serves as the vehicle to cart my <br/>\nbrain around, but I can get in a batting cage and hit some, which <br/>\nwould be a miracle to my 16 year old self. :)  Practice might improve <br/>\nmy performance, but I&#39;m satisfied with my abilities in that area.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 8 year old asked why I liked to read so much the other day and I  <br/>\nexplained, but almost everything I heard myself saying could have been <br/>\nalso said about movies, tv, games, roleplaying, etc.  Even my favorite <br/>\npart, which is that books are at my time, my speed can be done with <br/>\nDVR/Tivo these days.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne things books still have over electronics is that they are easier <br/>\nto replace when they fall in the bathtub and they don&#39;t need <br/>\nbatteries, so they work well on long airplane trips and on beaches, <br/>\nbut I see my son self entertain non-electronically by drawing - <br/>\nsomething that has never interested me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realized when I was answering him that escapism was always one of my <br/>\nmain reasons and I read far fewer books today than years ago both <br/>\nbecause I don&#39;t have such a strong need to escape and because I can <br/>\nread online and watch movies instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I&#39;m almost done with my long post.  One last thought...<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I have tried to avoid is comparisons, but right after he <br/>\nasked me why I liked to read, he said he didn&#39;t think he was smart. :( <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter we talked about the difference of smart vs. knowing vs. ability <br/>\nvs. practice and what exactly he is good at and why that might be, he <br/>\nspecifically brought up reading.  So I told him about older kids he <br/>\nknows who didn&#39;t learn to read until they were 10 or 12.  One was an <br/>\nunschooler and one is schooled.  He seemed surprised and then looked a <br/>\nbit relieved.  I&#39;ve always tried to be positive, but he gets other <br/>\nmessages about comparisons to age based abilities from family, friends <br/>\nand tv.<br/>\n<br/>\nI reminded him that he can read some things, so it&#39;s not that he <br/>\n*can&#39;t* read, but that he&#39;s learning to read. I see him developing <br/>\nneed based and practice based (username/passwords frequently entered) <br/>\nabilities and I trust that he will continue that path to meet his <br/>\nneeds in reading.  He&#39;s very proud of how fast he can type his <br/>\npassword on runescape (not an easy word, but I can&#39;t tell) and I told <br/>\nhim my story of typing - another slowly developed physical skill that <br/>\nI&#39;m now excellent at, but only by time and practice, like many <br/>\nthings.  And that he&#39;s probably a better typer than many his age.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is also the boy who could hit a baseball at age two and asked us <br/>\nto take off the training wheels on his bike when he was ready at age 4 <br/>\nand did a perfect ride the very first time.  He didn&#39;t get that from <br/>\nme. :)  (I&#39;ll spare you the story of my riding a bike into a tree at <br/>\nage 12).<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people develop coordination at a young age.

My understanding is that<br/>\nit&#39;s more to do with the way new information coming into the brain is<br/>\ninterpreted in terms of existing information.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow that often works out with children is that an adult who doesn&#39;t<br/>\nappreciate that &quot;careless talk costs lives&quot; (as those WW2 posters used<br/>\nto say) will write them off as a failure for all time on the basis of<br/>\ntheir failure to achieve something on a specific occasion.

The point is, though, that<br/>\nthe change requires an intention to change - beliefs usually don&#39;t<br/>\nchange themselves. Patterns of thought tend to become more rigid over<br/>\ntime as we tend to notice evidence that supports them and disregard<br/>\nevidence that doesn&#39;t.

Those processes are completely internal and can be messed up by an external <br/>\nfocus.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy thoughts--Joanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: not choosing books","postDate":"1208924923","msgId":34464,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZEREMwMThELTdFNTUtNEY2Ri1CNkNBLUM4NTlGN0E0RDBBOUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDliY2E5ZTMwODA0MjIyMDAyazQwZDBkOWU3ZzY2NDUyYThlZTdjZjlhMWRAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDgwNDIyMDk1MzM2LlBTUVJWLjEyMDQ4OC5yb290QGZlcHdlYjAzPiA8ZnVsMTV2K2RlYWlAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDw5YmNhOWUzMDgwNDIyMjAwMms0MGQwZDllN2c2NjQ1MmE4ZWU3Y2Y5YTFkQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":34463,"nextInTopic":34465,"prevInTime":34463,"nextInTime":34465,"topicId":34421,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-But do any of you, who have had children who don t read until 11, 12, 13 + feel that they could have grasped the concept of reading had they read earlier-=-","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1915750135\">-=-But do any of you,<br/>\nwho have had children who don&#39;t read until 11, 12, 13 + feel that  <br/>\nthey could<br/>\nhave grasped the concept of reading had they read earlier-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n??<br/>\n<br/>\nThey read when they read.

I  <br/>\n&gt; asked him to sing the hymn about Jerusalem, and though he knows it  <br/>\n&gt; thoroughly, he was too embarrassed to sing a single phrase.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, I think that&#39;s sad too.  I&#39;m that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will sing to my children.  I will even sing to my students.  There are a few books that I read each year that have songs in them and I will sing the songs when I am reading the book out loud in shared reading.  But if an adult comes into the room, I freeze up.  I would not sing in public.  It is sad.  I&#39;m working on this issue of mine... <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;  From my point of view, that&#39;s debilitating.

I want to be an artist, I tie dye as that is a way i can be an artist and a pretty good one, without the fear that what I am doing is not good enough.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-But reading at a literate level (and that level is of much debate)  <br/>\n&gt; is necessary for life and learning. -=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not as necessary as it once was.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t agree.   Actually, I think it&#39;s more necessary.  My grandfather could be very successful with a 4th grade education and being barely literate.  He was very good with math, but he could not read.  Now, I think there are few jobs that one can do without a level of literacy and education.  Not formal education, but education.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know any illiterate unschoolers (not grown or teens).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>That is very true.  I don&#39;t either.  But sadly, I know a whole bunch of schooled teens who are not literate. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] re: not choosing books","postDate":"1208831900","msgId":34428,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEREMzRDQkMzLTRGM0MtNDA0Qy05NURELURGNUJFNDMwN0ZCNkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDgwNDIxMjIwOTMxLjM5WUVGLjExMDAxNC5yb290QGZlcHdlYjAzPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDgwNDIxMjIwOTMxLjM5WUVGLjExMDAxNC5yb290QGZlcHdlYjAzPg=="},"prevInTopic":34427,"nextInTopic":34429,"prevInTime":34427,"nextInTime":34429,"topicId":34421,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Choosing not to read, I get that...
