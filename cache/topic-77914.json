People look at the situation only through my words, and that helps me see what my choices are. I know that my relationship with my kids really blossomed when we looked at our days in terms of choices.

Staying out of the drama and just being kind and neutral may end up serving the organization and perhaps you&#39;ll find people come around when the realize that you are not contributing to the &#39;poison.&#39;</div><div><br></div><div>The conflicting intentions and goals of our co-op essentially contributed to it breaking down, and then a core group who really wanted the the same thing started it up again. The rest of us did not re-join or try and push our own agenda in their new thing. It was for the best- it serves them well. There was no need to make it be everything or everyone, or meet all of our diverse needs.  </div><div><br></div><div>Also, kids change. Not sure if this runs through the summer, but maybe your kids will not be interested in returning. Maybe you can continue some friendships outside of the formal group over the summer and that will meet Wallace&#39;s social needs and he wont&#39; even want to go back. Or maybe he will, but more time and a break will give a needed pause and getting back together won&#39;t seem so challenging. </div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-2035014826gmail_extra\"><br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-2035014826gmail_quote\">On Mon, Mar 20, 2017 at 12:09 PM, Brenda Dixon <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brendagdixon@...\">brendagdixon@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] <span dir=\"ltr\">&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-2035014826gmail_quote\" style=\"margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;\">\n\n\n<u></u>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n<div style=\"background-color:#fff;\">\n<span style=\"display:none;\"> </span>\n\n\n<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2035014826m_-4561995958368278654ygrp-mlmsg\">\n  <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2035014826m_-4561995958368278654ygrp-msg\">\n\n\n    <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2035014826m_-4561995958368278654ygrp-text\">\n      \n      \n      <p></p><div dir=\"ltr\">Hi, Sarah,<div><br></div><div>I feel your pain.  I have also from time to time found myself in groups where the folks don&#39;t always seem the nicest.  </div><div><br></div><div>If your goal is to figure out how to stay in that group and make the best of it for yourself, you may find &quot;the work&quot; of Byron Katie to be useful.  At the risk of oversimplifying, she basically says first, that our suffering is (always) caused by our thoughts, and if we can challenge our thoughts, we become more peaceful.  She has a formula of questions that she recommends that we ask ourselves about our negative thoughts, starting with, &quot;is it true?&quot;  Then, &quot;are you absolutely sure it&#39;s true?&quot;  So maybe it&#39;s true that the other parents are catty and mean, or maybe it&#39;s not.  If you can find other reasons to attribute to their behavior, then maybe that will help you just move through them without worrying about whether they are being mean or not.  Second, one of Katie&#39;s other famous sayings is something like, &quot;If I had a prayer, it would be not to worry about what other people think of me.&quot;   Katie has lots of videos online, and of course many books and a website; I have found her work to be very helpful in keeping me from getting too worked up about stuff.</div><div><br></div><div>And finally, to quote one of my other heroes, &quot;when they go low, we go high.&quot;  Good luck.</div><div><br></div><div>Brenda Dixon</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-2035014826gmail_extra\"><br><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-2035014826gmail_quote\"><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-2035014826\">On Mon, Mar 20, 2017 at 10:12 AM, Sarah Thompson <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thompsonisland@...\">thompsonisland@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] <span dir=\"ltr\">&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups. com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br></span><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-2035014826\"><blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-2035014826gmail_quote\" style=\"border-left:1px #ccc solid;\">\n\n\n\n\n<u></u>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n<div style=\"background-color:#fff;\">\n<span> </span>\n\n\n\n\n<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2035014826m_-4561995958368278654m_5655211957509867617ygrp-mlmsg\">\n  <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2035014826m_-4561995958368278654m_5655211957509867617ygrp-msg\">\n\n\n\n\n    <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2035014826m_-4561995958368278654m_5655211957509867617ygrp-text\">\n      \n      \n      <p>Here is my situation:</p><div><br></div><div>I am involved in a homeschool group that is sort of like a coop but not exactly. I was asked to join to be involved in the advisory council that was supposed to be establishing this as a new group. My kids said they wanted to join so I agreed.

My younger child hasn&#39;t made any friends, really; he follows his brother around and makes it hard for him to do his own thing. He is finally really happy at home because he has started to make online friends in games. He says he wants to stay because the older child, Wallace, wants to stay, but he&#39;ll do what Wallace does. Wallace wants to stay because he IS making friends and having fun. Since I joined this organization for them, I should stay in it for them, but I don&#39;t know how to navigate an environment that is petty and hurtful in a healthy way for myself while staying positive for my kids, and all the kids I am organizing programming for (with whom I have a terrific rapport). </div><div><br></div><div>Sarah</div>\n<p></p>\n\n\n    </div>\n     \n\n\n    \n    <div style=\"color:#fff;height:0;\"></div>\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div></div></blockquote></span></div><br></div>\n<p></p>\n\n    </div>\n     \n\n    \n    <div style=\"color:#fff;height:0;\"></div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div></div></blockquote></div><br><br clear=\"all\"><div><br></div>-- <br><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-2035014826gmail_signature\"><div dir=\"ltr\"><div><div dir=\"ltr\"><font color=\"#3d85c6\">Kelly Callahan CCH </font><div><font color=\"#3d85c6\">Concentric Healing Classical Homeopathy<br></font><div><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.concentrichealing.com/\"><font color=\"#3d85c6\">www.concentrichealing.com</font></a></div><div><br></div><div><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:concentrichealing@...\"><font color=\"#3d85c6\">concentrichealing@...</font></a></span></div><div><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\"><font color=\"#3d85c6\">(207) 691-6798</font></span></div><div><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ConcentricHealing\" style=\"font-size:12.8000001907349px;\">facebook</a><br></div><div><br><br></div><div><i><br></i></div></div></div></div></div></div>\n</span></blockquote></div>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] I want to leave but my kids want to stay","postDate":"1490051315","msgId":77919,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY5QTlEMEMyLTIxODktNEIwQy05MkIyLTAyQjVCQzhENUU2OUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG9hcDVlMytzbTZ2dXFAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PENBUHYrY1l6TXJpTkRTN1pkMmVkUHFYT3g0clI4Nk5uYVh0V0tacWVaN21pakIreHo0UUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPENBUHYrY1l3ZnU3Z2lleksyeHpkQkFfQm9aUm5jaUxPK25ubnk3LW1rNkt0ODYxPXpFUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPG9hcDVlMytzbTZ2dXFAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":77918,"nextInTopic":77920,"prevInTime":77918,"nextInTime":77920,"topicId":77914,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Others might make different choices--maybe having a grandparent take the kids to the group, hiring a helper to go, asking dad to do it...
