There was a lot <br/>\nof cool math in there, some of it left me scratching my head (not out of <br/>\nlack of understanding, but of wonderment).  If math had been presented <br/>\nto me as a child the way it was in that book, I would have found it a <br/>\nlot more interesting.  There are mysteries to solve that I had no idea <br/>\nexisted before this book!  It left me with an understanding of how <br/>\nmathematicians can dedicate their lives to solving one of these <br/>\nmysteries.  The book was fun even for my 5 year old, even though the <br/>\nmajority of the math was over her head.  Yesterday, a good week after we <br/>\nfinished the book, my 9yo came to me in bed first thing in the morning <br/>\nand told me that 128 was a &quot;hopping number&quot; (a term used in the book for <br/>\npowers of 2;  128 = 2^7).
