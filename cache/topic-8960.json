There are two workshops on <br/>\nSeptember 14 and 15, 2002 from 9 am to 4 pm.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first workshop is called &quot;Discipline Without Punishments or <br/>\nRewards&quot; The description is as follows:<br/>\n\tLearn how to raise cooperative, responsible, and self-disciplined <br/>\nchildren without being either a dictator or a doormat. We will discuss <br/>\nthe pitfalls of punishments and rewards, and review the basic <br/>\ntechniques of democratic discipline with mutual respect between adults <br/>\nand children. Discover the three reasons for inappropriate behavior, <br/>\nand learn how to change children&#39;s behavior by recognizing and meeting <br/>\ntheir needs. <br/>\n<br/>\n\tThis workshop is useful for parents, teachers, daycare providers, <br/>\nnurses, social workers, therapists, and anybody else involved with <br/>\nbabies or children from newborn to pre-adolescents.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second workshop is called &quot;How to Help Children Heal from Stress <br/>\nand Trauma&quot; The description is as follows:<br/>\n\tWhen children are frequently angry, violent, hyperactive, or <br/>\nobnoxious, they may be suffering from the effects of stress or trauma. <br/>\nMore subtle symptoms may include fears, sleep problems, attachment <br/>\ndisorders, or physical illnesses. We will provide an overview of the <br/>\nmajor sources and symptoms of stress and trauma during infancy and <br/>\nchildhood, and discuss the conditions required for children to restore <br/>\nemotional health. The focus of this workshop is on recognizing and <br/>\nfacilitating children&#39;s spontaneous healing mechanisms, specifically <br/>\ncrying, raging, play, and laughter, thereby creating a healthy <br/>\nfunctioning child as he/she grows to maturity.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThis workshop is useful for parents, teachers, daycare providers, <br/>\nnurses, social workers, therapists, and anybody else involved with <br/>\nbabies or children from newborn to pre-adolescents.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fees for the workshops are $90 each but there is a sliding scale <br/>\nfor anyone who has a financial need. We are more interested in having <br/>\npeople come and don&#39;t want to turn anyone away for lack of funds.
