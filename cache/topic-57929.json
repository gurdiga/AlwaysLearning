I have 3 energetic boys, 8, 7, and 4.  A good chunk of the day is peaceful.  They draw, play games, look at and read books, watch tv, make lego creations, and so on.  They dig dirt outside :).  This usually goes well for a long time, but at some point they start arguing most days.  At that point I usually step in and I make suggestions.  We read together, do a project or what have you.  They all seem game.  My activities still seem very...schooly, for lack of a better word.  Unit study type things.  I like doing them, and they seem eager to do them with me.  Is this taking the ball out of their court too much?====<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems a little like you are treating your kids kinda like a unit. I think some of the other posters touched on this, but I think expecting the 8 and 7 year old to have the little one of 4 part of their activities pretty much all the time, or conversely to expect the 4 yo to keep up with the older pair in terms of interests and play, could be setting yourself up for these late day conflicts. Not *all* activities have to be appropriate for all three of them. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter does have friends who are a few years younger, and she loves her opportunities to play with them. She also has a few friends who are a little older. But she also has interests that are so very different from the kind of things that she was into four years ago (to make a point of the difference between 8 and 4). <br/>\n<br/>\nI would look at whether there is an expectation on your part that they all three always play together all day long, and whether some of the conflict is stemming from just flat being worn out by playing with people of such different developmental level for a long time. What might be needed is more separation at times, a little break when you take the little one off so that they can enagage in their more mature pursuits, or engage 4yo with his own age playmate visitor, so that you can spend time with your other boys without him.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Sometimes, it might look like something &quot;schooly&quot; if you are thinking in those terms.  For example, I had been saving toilet paper and paper towel rolls for awhile cause I saw an idea online somewhere of making a big skeleton out of them.  It was part of an online unit study, so if someone had come in while we were doing it, or if someone visits they might think we are studying skeletons.  Matter a fact yesterday, I mentioned to an aquantance that we made the skeleton and she asked if we were studying the human body this year.  Any, I pull the stuff out and if someone is around they ask what I am doing and in the end at least one, if not all the kids join in for atleast part of the thing. If they dont that is ok too.  I like to have some stuff like that to pull out when someone seems bored and having trouble figuring out what they would like to do.<br/>\nOur skeleton man is great by the way.

All of the things you mentioned they currently do without you, get involved in doing those things *with* them.

Ask if you can draw alongside them. Ask if you can sit or lay by them and read your book while they read theirs. Watch tv with them -- actively watch what they&#39;re watching rather than doing something else while they watch. Go dig in the dirt with them; take a bucket or pan of water and make mud, then make mud pies or have mud fights.<br/>\n<br/>\nSurprise them by making a fort inside the house, or set up a tent in your backyard. Set up a scavenger hunt for them. Have an Easter Egg hunt with plastic eggs (although we often hid toy cars or other toys instead of plastic eggs). Tell them you&#39;re going to hide and ask them to find you. Ask them if they want to open a pretend store in their room (or the living room or wherever) - you can alternate being the store owner and the customer. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest thing is to be proactive rather than reactive. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile you&#39;re in the initial stages of deschooling, asking to join in in what they&#39;re doing can be a way to do things with them in a way that allows them to direct what happens, which can, in turn, help you reign in the desire to steer things towards schooliness. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===My activities still seem very...schooly, for lack of a better word.
