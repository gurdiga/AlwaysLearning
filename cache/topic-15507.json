First, Anne is Canadian, so perhaps Jean is<br/>\n&gt; from Quebec, and is male. If that&#39;s the case, maybe Anne is the Daydream<br/>\n&gt; Believer, and Jean is the home coming Queen. Perhaps this song is lamenting<br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; fact that she has feelings for her gay male friend, who alas, does not return<br/>\n&gt; them.  Maybe he&#39;s staying with her while recovering from a bad relationship,<br/>\n&gt; which is also the reason why he needs to cheer up.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Another possibility is this. There have been rumors for years that Anne is a<br/>\n&gt; lesbian. Maybe Jean is female, and her lover. Then either of them could be the<br/>\n&gt; DB or the HQ.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 5 Well, if Jean is a gay male, and Anne was under the impression that he<br/>\n&gt; could save her or something, and was happy about that, then that would explain<br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; whole white knight thing. But later, she reflects that they don&#39;t really need<br/>\n&gt; that, and she can just nurse Jean through this hard time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If Jean is female, then we&#39;re just being sexist to assume that a white knight<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t be female, now aren&#39;t we?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Or Jean could be Jean d&#39;Arc, aka Joan of Arc, and then being female and a<br/>\nknight would make perfect sense!  The rest of the song makes even less sense<br/>\nthen, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; 6 Well, this is clearly an example of misheard lyrics (the original said<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Without dollar one to spend&quot;) but it works too.
