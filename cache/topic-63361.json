When the child is done, then it&#39;s done or, for the more conservative, when the child is slowing down, that&#39;s the only time to consider beginning to discourage it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause so many unschoolers came out of La Leche League, I think (can&#39;t prove this but it seems right) that&#39;s why the phrase &quot;child-led learning&quot; cropped up independently in various places.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that it&#39;s not a good parallel.  LLL doesn&#39;t talk about &quot;child-led breastfeeding&quot; or &quot;child-led nursing.&quot;   That, they&#39;re clear about, is the mom&#39;s job to facilitate and to embrace and understand and Get Right.  If the mom doesn&#39;t figure out how to do it (the baby already knows, pretty much, but moms can be awkward and screw it up), it might not happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo with unschooling.  If the mom doesn&#39;t figure out how to facilitate learning (the children already know how to learn, if they haven&#39;t been to school so long they have scars on their learning), unschooling might not happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for weaning, I think &quot;child-led&quot; is great.<br/>\nFor nursing and learning, moms need to be at their best, on a team, but leading and managing, especially at first.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63354,"nextTopicId":63155}}
