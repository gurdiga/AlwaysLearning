They want the world to be a more child-friendly place. While this wish is very understandable, it can sometimes lead to disrespectful behaviour towards others. <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember a discussion on a German parenting list where someone just couldn&#39;t understand why churches couldn&#39;t be a place for children to play  noisily. But I wasn&#39;t much better myself at that time: When my oldest was little (1 year old) I used to let him run into people&#39;s frontyards when we were out and about. It wasn&#39;t enough for me to be nicer to my child, I also wanted others to be nicer to children and give them more space. In the same way, I could imagine that you just wanted people to be more relaxed about children&#39;s mistakes. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the problem with this kind of thinking is that it doesn&#39;t respect other ways of living. I didn&#39;t respect people&#39;s property by letting my toddler run into their frontyard. The lady from the German mailinglist didn&#39;t respect people&#39;s wish to pray in peace when she wanted the church to be a place where children could play. And you might have come across as disrespectful when you didn&#39;t respect the groups wish for listening to a guide or for carrying on. <br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nBettina</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Trusting my child, waiting, and other adults step in","postDate":"1360938201","msgId":70564,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE4NjFBQjAwLTY1M0QtNEM5Mi1BQjY1LThFN0ZDODc0OUM5Q0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGtma2YxMit2bnI3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtma2YxMit2bnI3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":70563,"nextInTopic":70565,"prevInTime":70563,"nextInTime":70565,"topicId":70540,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

You&#39;re shouldn&#39;t be depending on &quot;hierarchical cues&quot; to tell you. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve guessed wrong about what&#39;s acceptable in a group, if you weren&#39;t paying attention, those cues are useful feedback. But those signals shouldn&#39;t be a constant thing. If they are, you&#39;re missing the big picture of how your behavior is impacting others.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; With the outing that I am highlighting, the cues seemed to go from person to person like a tacit undercurrent.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think the question that will be more helpful to ask yourself is why did the situation seem so out of the ordinary that you needed to rely on other people to give you signals about how to behave?<br/>\n<br/>\nWas it a group new to you? Did they have certain expectations you weren&#39;t aware of? Then part of your learning about the group is hanging back more to observe. (Just as new members are asked to do here to help them figure out how the list works. It&#39;s a principle useful when joining any new group :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIs the group made up of a non-mainstream culture or religion? They&#39;ll have different rules of behavior. It&#39;s up to you to figure them out then help your son with them. If you visit Japan, you pay attention so you know to leave your shoes at the door, then help your son do the same.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; we had three or four different sets of parenting/learning allowances for children&#39;s behavior:<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Different parents will have different standards of behavior for their kids. A well established group will generally have its own standards about what&#39;s okay and what&#39;s not.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your general rule is helping him meet his needs AND let the core of the group do what it&#39;s gathered for, you&#39;ve got a good start. Then you can use what other parents are doing to help you decide if you need to adjust. Or decide if this is the right group for you. If everyone&#39;s making their kids sit quietly to listen and your kids can&#39;t, it&#39;s not a good fit for your family.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 1) Stand completely still and back from the speaker, 2) Standing still but near the speaker, 3) Walking around but not near the speaker, 4) Playing on the logs behind the speaker at their own game. Children were between 5 and 10.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From what I am calling hierarchical cues, my son settled (with my help) from 3, to 2, and then to 1.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Different groups will have different rules about acceptable behavior. Some will want kids more contained than others. Don&#39;t expect your son to be able to figure this out himself yet. He might not be able until he&#39;s a teen. Use your rules as a first guess then adjust.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My 7 year-old wanted to play on the logs (a physical and fun activity that we both value),<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why is your value of this important? What&#39;s important in a group is whether others find it disrupting or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and I let him do so after the guide had finished his talk. After a short time, I received a series of grimaces and head shakes from one of the parents letting me know that the group was done and we as a group were moving on.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you weren&#39;t paying attention, then it was thoughtful of people to give you a clue that the group was moving on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy were they grimacing and head shaking? It sound negative. Did you miss subtler clues? Are there expectations of this particular group that you&#39;re not aware of?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the way they communicated made you uncomfortable, then maybe the group isn&#39;t for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr are you being hyper-sensitive to criticism? Just with this group? Or in general?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Maybe this explanation is better: cues within a group telling you that you don&#39;t get to do what you want to do, that someone else is deciding what you are going to do, and that to be part of the group you will follow along.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what groups are for: to do something together. Some groups are tighter. Some looser. Depends on the group. Depends on what the group has gathered for. If you can&#39;t adjust your own actions so the group can do its thing, don&#39;t join a group.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think that is what some parents joke about when they tell their kids that &quot;the rule is to have no fun&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you feel that vibe from the group, then it doesn&#39;t sound like a good fit. Don&#39;t expect your son to be able to pick up what&#39;s going on and adjust.

Both too little and too much are unclear.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you&#39;re confusing precision with clarity. Plain words are less precise than 25 cent words but they&#39;re usually clearer.

If someone&#39;s speaking, if people are listening, that trumps other people -- adults or children -- doing their own thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelping him understand how to meet his needs AND be nice to others will be a mixture of doing and telling. Doing is usually best. The more you help him meet his needs without disturbing others in a variety of situations, the clearer he&#39;ll get on what behavior is okay where. Sometimes a few words will help him see what&#39;s most important, like, &quot;People are trying to listen.&quot; But it&#39;s really up to you to be aware and do what your team needs to do -- to meet his needs in ways that are kind to him and others -- until he&#39;s able to do it himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I listed my observations of the changing social structure of the hiking outing.<br/>\n&gt; I thought the enumeration would make it easier to understand that there were<br/>\n&gt; many ways that the children and adults were behaving and that a norm had<br/>\n&gt; simply not been reached.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a very complex way of saying that the situation kept changing.

For the sake of the<br/>\nsense of comfort of others, you might have needed to say it out loud so<br/>\nthey knew you&#39;d handled it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":87677351,"authorName":"mommy_singing","from":"&quot;mommy_singing&quot; &lt;theresame2000@...&gt;","profile":"mommy_singing","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Trusting my child, waiting, and other adults step in","postDate":"1360870664","msgId":70540,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtmamVlOCtkaGExQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":70541,"prevInTime":70539,"nextInTime":70541,"topicId":70540,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In my journey into gentle and trusting parenting and helping with my child s learning, we come across this situation - often.

My son started throwing snowballs (as other kids were throwing snowballs and we had talked about this happy possibility while driving to the hike).  He did not get the clue that someone did not want to play, or my child&#39;s desire to play overruled the clue that this other person probably didn&#39;t want to play.  I noticed that the person didn&#39;t like the snowball (the man was bewildered).   My son noticed both the person&#39;s reaction and my clues to have my son stop (I shook my head, no).  My son paused, took in the information, and stopped playing snowball with that person.  I was really pleased that he processed the social cue, and I was pleased that my son remained happy and interacting though he had made a &quot;mistake&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I was about 10 feet down hill from him and moving slowly.  3 parents decided that they had to intervene, scold my child, become upset because he did not say sorry for it, and tell him to stop throwing snowballs period.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do I help my son learn his social cues and recognize his success, because he had several successes in his social interactions, when other adults move in and take over?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, any ideas on how to regain our aplomb in such a situation?<br/>\n<br/>\nTheresa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70526,"nextTopicId":70514}}
