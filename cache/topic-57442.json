Because it&#39;s rare and controversial, I can&#39;t just turn<br/>\nblindly to an expert to guide me.  I spend a great deal of time researching<br/>\ntreatments and doctors who claim to have the answers.  Things are settling<br/>\nback down again, now that my daughter is being treated by someone I trust<br/>\nand she is getting better.  Spending much of the last year wrapped up in my<br/>\nown thoughts was really the reason that I found the right care for my<br/>\ndaughter, so there is a place and a time, but now that she is on the road to<br/>\nrecovery, now is the time to get back to living in the moment.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI know my older daughter especially misses that and today I&#39;m going to step<br/>\nback into that role which once came easily to me and that I took for granted<br/>\nthat I&#39;d never have a reason to stop doing.  Today I&#39;m going to spend time<br/>\njust being with my girls and enjoying the time. I&#39;m not going to spend it on<br/>\nthe internet or worrying about what tomorrow will bring.   It will probably<br/>\nseem like a blink in time before they are gone and I&#39;m sorry that I&#39;ve<br/>\nmissed a good chunk of it this last year.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela ~ feeling thankful <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57418,"nextTopicId":57188}}
