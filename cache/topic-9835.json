She is <br/>\nlooking at making the return trip home in a few days and ought to be <br/>\nconcentrating her energy on Recovering rather than worrying over the <br/>\nconference.<br/>\n<br/>\nA brief note on the conference:  I would call it an Enormous Success.  Sandra <br/>\nhas been missed, no doubt.  She was the reason some attendees made the <br/>\ntrip.  But the generosity of the other speakers in juggling times to fill in and <br/>\nthe pure enthusiasm that is generated by the convergence of 150 <br/>\nUNschoolers can not be Overstated.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wish they would all move in to my neighborhood.  What a cool time we <br/>\nwould have Every Day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is immeasureable comfort in being surrounded by those who &quot;get&quot; <br/>\nwhere you are coming from.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been surprised and pleased by the variety of backgrounds the <br/>\nattendees represent.  City people and Country people.  Northerners with <br/>\nthose &quot;funny accents&quot; ;*)  And plenty of Southern drawl-ers. Veteran <br/>\nUnschoolers and those just recently converted. Vegans to enthusiastic <br/>\ncarnivores.  LOTS of Dads!!!!  Yea.  That has been so THRILLING.  To see all <br/>\nthese guys seeming so comfortable and enthusiastic about their status as <br/>\nUNschooling parents.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe no-age-limit  funshops and presentations have been a rousing success.  <br/>\nNo one has had to be asked to exit a presentation due to a disruptive little <br/>\nperson.  The little people have thoroughly enjoyed the funshops designed to <br/>\npique their interest and the tiniest ones have played at the back of the <br/>\nspeaker rooms with trains, cars, blocks, etc....   happily co-existing with the <br/>\npresenters up front.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I said a &quot;brief note&quot;.  Can you tell what Great Times we&#39;ve been <br/>\nhaving?  :*)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sorry that Sandra has not been able to participate in what I know she <br/>\nwould have fully delighted in.  I do think she&#39;ll be pleased to know that we all <br/>\ncarried on and gleaned the best out of the time spent with other like-minded <br/>\nsouls.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are already talking about next year&#39;s conference.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope Sandra will be able to join us then.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope some of you folks will be able to make it too.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease do send her your good thoughts and best energy.
