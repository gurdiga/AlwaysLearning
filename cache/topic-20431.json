At the<br/>\nmoment it&#39;s hard to live our lives as if school didn&#39;t exist.  We live<br/>\nrurally, and there aren&#39;t that many kids around to play with - and even<br/>\nthen it involves lots of driving.  So at the moment, things look pretty<br/>\ndreary in the playmate department because of school.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter&#39;s best friend is going back to school, and that means she won&#39;t<br/>\nbe available to play.  She&#39;s not really available to play much in the<br/>\nsummer either, because their family is so busy doing all of the non-school<br/>\nthings they can&#39;t do during the school year.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast Spring we found out about a new homeschool park day, met some new<br/>\nfriends, and have been really enjoying that.  It&#39;s been a small group of<br/>\n4-5 families.  However, it&#39;s going to dissolve because 4 of the families<br/>\nare going to send their kids to a homeschool school 2 days a week, and they<br/>\njust don&#39;t have the time to hang out at the park and do all of the other<br/>\nadventures they want to.  My daughter is furious.  She says, how can you<br/>\nhave a homeschool school?  She wants to find a new homeschooling group<br/>\nwhere the folks promise that they will really be &quot;home&quot; schoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat she really wants is someone who can play anytime without all of those<br/>\nridiculous parental limitations!  &quot;Not after school, she needs some quiet<br/>\ntime.&quot;  &quot;Not on the weekend, we need some family time.&quot;  &quot;Not after dinner,<br/>\nshe needs to go to bed early because of school tomorrow.&quot;  &quot;Not this<br/>\nmorning, she needs to do her school work.&quot;  &quot;Not tomorrow, I&#39;ve (the<br/>\nparent) got a lot of work to do.&quot;  I have heard every one of these excuses.<br/>\nThe last one, in particular, really gets me going... so because the parent<br/>\nis busy the kids can&#39;t play?<br/>\n<br/>\nI just read Sandra&#39;s article on playing.  I think that playing is a dying<br/>\nart.  I remember being able to run out of the house the moment I got home<br/>\nfrom school so I could go play until dinner.  But then when I was a kid I<br/>\nlived in a neighborhood without fences between everyone&#39;s yard.  Once<br/>\noutside, it was free... the space, the decisions, the play.  It was all<br/>\nfree.  Here in California every house is fenced, if you live in or near the<br/>\ncities.  Where I live there aren&#39;t any fences, but there aren&#39;t any<br/>\nneighbors either.  It doesn&#39;t seem to matter though, kids still don&#39;t seem<br/>\nto be able to get together when they want to.  What happened?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;m wondering what to do next.  I need some new creative ideas in order<br/>\nto provide the play that my daughter needs.  I can play with her some, but<br/>\nI really can&#39;t be her full time playmate.  We don&#39;t have any siblings for<br/>\nher to play with.  I&#39;m starting to think that staying where we are may not<br/>\nbe the right thing for her, and thus for the whole family.  She&#39;s lonely.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening to me rant.  If anyone has any stories to share, I&#39;d<br/>\nlove to hear them.  For now, we&#39;re going to try to find another<br/>\nhomeschooler&#39;s park day.  It won&#39;t be close to home, but who knows...<br/>\nperhaps it will be if we find some serious homeschoolers, as my daughter<br/>\nputs it.

I guess, tho, there are parents who expected the work years to end once they could pack the kids off to school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe in the case of school-at-homers, that break comes in being able to follow a curriculum and someone else&#39;s hard and fast philosophy, rather than finding your own path.  I find it much harder to try to do things someone else&#39;s way -- I know I&#39;m in the minority there. It seems that with parenting, people like that assurance that if they just follow &#39;the plan&#39; they&#39;ll turn out a good kid.
