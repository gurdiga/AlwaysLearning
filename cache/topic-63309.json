Sandra and Kirby Dodd are already in the film along with some other unschoolers. The film isn&#39;t complete yet - they still have a long way to go because they want to select a family to be sort of the centerpiece. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, they showed what they&#39;ve got so far at the August HSC conference and the September Good Vibrations conference and it really looks like it is going to be a wonderful film. They are doing fundraising for it - and NHEN (National Home Education Network) has just given them a $5,000 matching grant - meaning NHEN will give them a dollar for every dollar contributed (up to $5,000). <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can see a short trailer and get more information about the film on their website:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolfilm.com/\">http://www.homeschoolfilm.com/</a>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you think your family would make a great centerpiece for the film and you&#39;re willing to be followed around by a guy with a camera &lt;g&gt;, you might want to let Jeremy know. I&#39;m confident that it will be a good outcome, unlike some of the commercial tv programs where they edit the footage to make unschoolers look bad. The film is about learning outside a classroom and explores how that learning can take place in a wide variety of ways, including unschooling. It will be really nice to see a film made by someone who really gets unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63201,"nextTopicId":63310}}
