Stopping the medicating of emotions is so important. Allowing our children to feel and be angry or sad or whatever it is without trying to fix it (if it&#39;s not a possibility) for them just to simply stop them crying. It is hard sometimes to listen to crying/raging/screaming and remain calm and kind a nd nurturing but such a wonderful gift we can give to our children.<br/>\n<br/>\nKim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: halfshadow1 <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, March 24, 2007 12:57 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Alot of screaming<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  -Looking at it that way would make me angry too.

What ALWAYS works is real,  <br/>\nhonest, respectful, genuine connecting with my children.  That&#39;s what  <br/>\nthey respond to.  When my girls were 5 they responded well to the re- <br/>\nstating their feelings.  But now if I try that they tell me to shut  <br/>\nup.  Yeah... I&#39;d say the same thing to someone who tried to talk to  <br/>\nme like that.  Kids can always tell if your &quot;there&quot; or if your just  <br/>\nwhipping out tactics to try and &quot;fix&quot; a situation.  One is genuine,  <br/>\nthe other is phony.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks Sandra for the &quot;a HA&quot; moment....

Worse, to do it habitually?<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t help feeling that it wouldn&#39;t be long before he stopped trusting <br/>\nanything you said.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly say tomorrow if that is the truth. Pacifying him is only postponing <br/>\nexpressing his grief.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, people have reported success with pursuing a magical fantasy with <br/>\ntheir upset child along the lines of &quot;Gee wouldn&#39;t it be great if we could <br/>\njust wave a magic wand and have all the cheese puffs we want any time. What <br/>\nif I could wave my wand over that tree and it would just grow cheese puffs <br/>\nas if they were oranges. Or maybe we could have a magic cow that gave cheese <br/>\npuffs instead of milk. I wish we could have that.&quot; It shows that you are <br/>\nsympathetic to the seriousness of his desire.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother idea is to stop saying &quot;but&quot;. Stop before the &quot;but&quot;. The &quot;but&quot; is <br/>\npart of what is negating the feelings that are real and strong right now. <br/>\nYou reported that you have said things like, &quot;I&#39;m sorry that we don&#39;t have <br/>\nany puffs, but we&#39;ll get more tomorrow.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are thinking logically and sensibly, BUT he isn&#39;t able to do that yet <br/>\ndevelopmentally. He is probably hearing everything after the &quot;but&quot; as <br/>\nminimizing. You might have more success if you stick with just the empathy <br/>\nportion of the statement (&quot;I&#39;m so sorry we&#39;re out of puffs&quot;) and let him <br/>\nmourn that loss for a while until he is ready to hear the solution portion.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for you and your dh coping with your nerves, the best suggestion I have <br/>\nis to try to breathe through it. Notice your feelings but don&#39;t follow them <br/>\nor dive into them, if that makes sense. Deep breaths. Vocalize that you are <br/>\ntaking some deep breaths to help you stay calm.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Jayn was a baby, from about 12 weeks old for about 4 weeks Jayn would <br/>\ncry for about 20-30 minutes every evening. This is something that is <br/>\nperfectly normal for some percentage of babies (See Brazelton &quot;Touchpoints&quot; <br/>\nfor more information). It was not colic, and it was not because Jayn had any <br/>\nneed other than to cry. I supported her need to cry - the infant version of <br/>\ntalking out her busy day - by taking her to a private place and holding her, <br/>\nlooking into her eyes and every now and then murmuring something positive <br/>\nlike &quot;Yes, what a hard time.&quot; Eventually she would give a little sigh and <br/>\nlatch on to my always available nipple. It took a concious choice not to get <br/>\ncaught up in the noise of her crying, but to focus actually on her. One <br/>\nthing that helped me was the mantra &quot;This too shall pass&quot;. If I focussed on <br/>\nhow hard the crying was to listen to, it felt like it lasted for hours (even <br/>\nthough it didn&#39;t).<br/>\n<br/>\nDanielle Conger has a great deal of stuff about meditation and strategies <br/>\nthat help her support her son&#39;s rages. Her writing is linked from <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/danielleconger\">http://sandradodd.com/danielleconger</a>  She also owns the Always Unschooled <br/>\nlist for the parents of younger children (also linked from the same page).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a kind of rigor in committing to honesty with one&#39;s children. There <br/>\nhave been moments when I was tempted to utilize a &quot;little white lie&quot; such as <br/>\n&quot;the store was out&quot; instead of admitting I just forgot. But I remind myself <br/>\nto be scrupulously honest with Jayn, so that now I feel strong tension when <br/>\nI am skirting towards leaving something out. The one time that I was living <br/>\na lie with her, without intending to be so, damaged the trust we had built. <br/>\n(It was that I wasn&#39;t expressing my true opinion about one of her friends.)<br/>\n<br/>\nTruth has become so much a part of our life that I get a kind of shock when <br/>\nI hear other parents just using lies for their convenience. Just the other <br/>\nday I heard a Mom saying, &quot;The museum is closing now&quot; because she was ready <br/>\nto leave, instead of being honest about it being her choice. It is a way of <br/>\nabrogating responsibility for choosing to be the authority. And it appears <br/>\nin the short term to be the easiest choice, the pacifying action, but kids <br/>\naren&#39;t stupid. The child in question with the &quot;closing&quot; museum incident was <br/>\nentirely dubious and pointed out several people actually entering. So then <br/>\nthe lie had to change to &quot;They are *getting ready* to close.&quot; Yeah in 2 1/2 <br/>\nhours time! The kid knew. He knew he couldn&#39;t trust his Mom to tell him the <br/>\ntruth if it was at all inconvenient for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

It always amazes me now <br/>\nwhen I read more conventional parenting books the kind of issues that <br/>\nparents are getting tied in knots about, like haircuts or wearing pajamas <br/>\nor...well all the stuff Unschooling has shown me how to just let go of <br/>\ntrying or even wanting to control.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are looking for solutions to &quot;stop the screaming&quot;, I don&#39;t think that <br/>\nbook is about that. I think it is about responding lovingly to the needs <br/>\nthat kids have, and about making life more peaceful overall, creating the <br/>\nenvironment where the stressors are reduced so that there are fewer <br/>\noutbursts over time as the child matures. YMMV.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I really do validate Lukas&#39; feelings, I say things<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; like: your upset because the 4x4 is stuck or Your sad.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmm. If you are making an assumption that the immediate apparent problem is <br/>\nwhat is causing the upset but the real stress is more nebulous those words <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t help. Also screaming is probably not &quot;sad&quot;. Some of those &quot;this is <br/>\nhow to validate&quot; ideas come from the notion that children need to be taught <br/>\nthe right words to identify their own feelings.  :/<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me validating and empathizing with Jayn is less wordy. It is about <br/>\nallowing my internal conviction that Jayn has the right to feel and express <br/>\nher feelings show on my face and in my body. Sometimes it is more like <br/>\nsaying, &quot;What a shame&quot; if the root of the problem really is right in the <br/>\nmoment. Sometimes it is just nodding and saying, &quot;I know&quot;. Sometimes it is <br/>\njust holding out my arms.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy clue usually is if I fix it (to use your example, pull the truck out of <br/>\nthe sand) but she stays upset or cranky then that clearly wasn&#39;t the real <br/>\ncause. I&#39;m very lucky with Jayn because she is a child that usually wants to <br/>\nbe hugged when there is a problem, and certainly wants to interact <br/>\nphysically when she is stressed - so it is a lot easier for me to help her. <br/>\nHowever sometimes I just get it wrong too, and the outburst escalates.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  I like your<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; idea about taking him somewhere when he *explodes* I don&#39;t know how i<br/>\n&gt; can though because it&#39;s so sudden and we live in a small house(619<br/>\n&gt; square feet) So, everything is heard. Plus, when he gets that upset,<br/>\n&gt; he runsinto the bathroom and doesn&#39;t want anyone to bother him.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry to be chuckling but, um, you don&#39;t know how you can, but he <br/>\nalready does! It&#39;s not my idea, it&#39;s the idea of other people who have <br/>\nshared it over the years, AND it apparently is his idea too. So the bathroom <br/>\nis his haven. I bet he enjoys in a visceral kind of way the echoey reverb <br/>\nthat bathrooms often have. Can he run water over his hands while in there?<br/>\n<br/>\nI love the suggestion to just be available on the other side of the door. I <br/>\nwould add that on no account give him a lecture about not screaming when he <br/>\nemerges.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found that much later, after dinner, when Jayn and I are snuggling <br/>\nquietly on the sofa or bed is the best time to ask a few questions about her <br/>\nfeelings earlier. BTW she has found screaming into a pillow to be really <br/>\neffective. There have been times when one really good scream is all she has <br/>\nneeded to let out the frustration. Or pouring out some water. Sometimes our <br/>\nbest conversations about feelings have happened during a physical activity. <br/>\n(Do I seem to be saying this over and over on every list I am on?

Maybe I&#39;m too harsh, but I don&#39;t allow my children to impose their will over other members of the family.  We all have to learn to live together, and of course sometimes nerves get frayed, but part of the learning and growing experience includes respect for other people.  It could be that your son is frustrated because he needs to be engaged in an activity that stimulates his curiosity, or he may be frustrated because he needs more boundaries.  You might say something like &quot;we don&#39;t have any of that right now, but we do have this&quot; and offer an alternative and then suggest some fun activity that you could do together.  If that doesn&#39;t work you might try sending him to his room until he stops screaming with the understanding that he is free to come and join you at any time as long as the screaming stops.  When your husband wants to watch T.V. let him know that<br/>\n this is Daddy&#39;s time to watch T.V. and take him out of the room if he screams.  He needs to understand that there are many hours during the day for him to watch what he wants, but Dad needs time also and this is showing respect for others.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I hope that helps, but I understand that many different approaches could be tried until the right one does the trick.  Another idea that came to me is to keep a record of what he eats and see if you notice a change in behavior when certain foods are consumed.  I don&#39;t know much about food allergies or if that might play a role in his behavior, but it&#39;s worth investigation.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Hang in there!<br/>\n  Melody :-)<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nhalfshadow1 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:halfshadow1@...\">halfshadow1@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  I need help with my 5yo. son.

Whenever he doesn&#39;t hear the answer he<br/>\nwants or a situation happens that is beyond my or my husbands control,<br/>\nhe screams and runs off. I want to help him and our family because it<br/>\nis very stressful to all of us. I make as much as i can userfriendly. <br/>\n I will write some examples;Kuas is riding his 4x4 and gets stuck in<br/>\nsand, as soon as that happens he cries out: Oooh,it&#39;s stuck! and runs<br/>\noff screaming and crying.
