I began ticking off all of the Xmas<br/>\ntraditions that were originally Pagan celebrations (evergreen trees,<br/>\npopcorn/cranberry garlands, lights, mistletoe) -- even the DATE of Xmas is<br/>\nnear to Solstice so to include the Pagans :)<br/>\nShe told me to shut up -- ignorance was more comfortable than knowing the<br/>\ntruth about Paganism in her life. She didn&#39;t want me to touch Easter (the<br/>\nword itself -- a variation of a pagan goddess [*Eostra* (Ostara)] and her<br/>\nbird-turned-bunnie who laid the Spring Colors in her eggs & from whose name<br/>\nwe get estrogen).<br/>\nWhen you look at things like this *without fear* those things can be<br/>\nexplained easily, as they&#39;ve all taken new meaning as they&#39;ve been<br/>\nincorporated into modern-day Christianity.<br/>\nI would be heartbreaking for a kid to grow up hearing from their parents<br/>\nthat Paganism is evil and dirty and then find out how deeply paganism is<br/>\nrooted in our everyday traditions and vocabulary.  I don&#39;t want to be a liar<br/>\nnor a hypocrite in my children&#39;s eyes.<br/>\n~diana :)<br/>\nxoxoxoxo<br/>\nhannahbearski.blogspot.com<br/>\nhannahsashes.blogspot.com<br/>\ndianas365.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40252,"nextTopicId":40639}}
