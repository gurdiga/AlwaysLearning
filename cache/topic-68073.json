Sometimes three, sometimes four or five, depending how much work there is.  Four days a week, sometimes five, not all in a row.  But that leaves all evenings available, though he goes to sleep early those days.  Keith said that Marty was still out at fireworks when Keith went to bed at 9:30, which seemed late, for Marty, to Keith.  When Marty was a the end of his sixteen year, and all through his 17th, he worked from 6:30 a.m. to 3:00.  School hours, basically.  Monday through Friday.   The reason he was working those hours is that he was a &quot;courtesy clerk&quot; (bagged groceries, cleaned up spills, helped people find things, carried groceries to cars), and because he wasn&#39;t in school he could work those hours that schoolkids couldn&#39;t.  All during that time, Marty went to bed at 9:00 when he was working the next day.  It was nothing we advised him to do.  I thought he could&#39;ve done fine going to bed at 10:00 or 11:00, but he made his own schedule, and we were all quiet for him to sleep when he wanted to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI need to add their two latest schedules (somewhere) to the list I started for The Big Book, page 260.  I guess I need a webpage now so I can update it.  It goes around the clock now, because the earliest start time was that 6:30 a.m., and the latest was 6:00 pm.  I think Kirby had a 10:00 starting time at Blizzard last year.  I&#39;ll check with him to be sure.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo my main point is that there was no way to prepare the for any of those work schedules by choosing an arbitrary bedtime.  What *did* prepare them was their learning from an early age to plan around activities and obligations (with my assistance).   And they were always considerate of those who are asleep, and continue to be so.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":440291924,"authorName":"Liz","from":"&quot;Liz&quot; &lt;lizjane68@...&gt;","profile":"lizmikeerinryan","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: kids staying up all night","postDate":"1341510854","msgId":68091,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGp0NGtjNitlZXU5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGp0NGVwZStpdHZkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68089,"nextInTopic":68092,"prevInTime":68090,"nextInTime":68092,"topicId":68073,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Robyn, thank you so much for writing that!!

That sounds like my daughter (and myself sometimes).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI seem to go in cycles throughout the year (of feeling awake more hours than a 24 hour period normally allows, or the total opposite), and my daughter just has always been like this.  I&#39;ve often thought &quot;24 hours is just not enough in the day&quot;, not for the reason of getting things done, but often because it just doesn&#39;t fit her, and at times mine, natural cycle of sleep/waking hours.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a baby, during the day, she slept for 15 minutes, then was awake for hours.  Never was awake for hours, then sleeping for hours (as my son and all the other babies I knew were).  I can&#39;t tell you how many times during her toddler/prek years, she&#39;d wake me up at 2am and happily ask &quot;wanna do crafts?&quot;  There were so many times we&#39;d get up so as to not disturb hubby and son in the family bed, and go downstairs, and just be awake for the rest of the day.  She was just ready.  And she never &#39;crashed&#39; from that cycle.  I often wondered if it had something to do w/ how her brain was wired, connected to her seizures in some way.  of course who knows...<br/>\n<br/>\nyou post has really helped me to see her cycle more clearly.  I always knew it, but didn&#39;t *really* know it.  I&#39;m going to keep this in mind as she and I try some planning of her schedule.

Personally, if I had to be out the door at 10, I’d set my alarm for 9, lie around in bed for half an hour waking up, then rush around the house like mad to get out the door on time.  Other people might like to set their alarm for the latest possible time, then get straight up and rush around the house, or set their alarm early and get straight up and get ready in a leisurely fashion.  Might be worth talking to her and finding out which she’s prefer.  You might even be able to let her sleep in till the last minute, have everything ready, and she can eat breakfast on the way.  <br/>\nTamara<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] kids staying up all night","postDate":"1341389746","msgId":68080,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI5NDY5MjFFLTRBODQtNDE5Ri1CRTQ5LUY5QkQwOEVEQkVGQUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBTUhKS0wtLS1udWdBT0N1bzlLM1lURlIxMkYwdUo2Q3RjNUEyU3czelVPeitIcWhOd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGpzdjA2aytnbTNmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8Q0FNSEpLTC0tLW51Z0FPQ3VvOUszWVRGUjEyRjB1SjZDdGM1QTJTdzN6VU96K0hxaE53QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68078,"nextInTopic":68082,"prevInTime":68079,"nextInTime":68081,"topicId":68073,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I think that at 10 and 12 yrs old your kids should be able to understand that people who are sleeping should not be disturbed, especially the person who has","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1886885871\">-=-I think that at 10 and 12 yrs old your kids should be able to understand<br/>\nthat people who are sleeping should not be disturbed, especially the person<br/>\nwho has to get up and earn the money that makes this whole unschooling life<br/>\npossible!

He leaves all the homeschooling up to<br/>\n&gt; me. I&#39;ve explained a bit here and there about unschooling, but honestly<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t come out and said to him &quot;we&#39;re unschooling&quot;. He sees we don&#39;t &quot;do<br/>\n&gt; school work&quot; anymore, and was questioning it a lot. The kids recently had<br/>\n&gt; to take state tests to comply (we&#39;re in NY and I give them the homeschool<br/>\n&gt; friendly PASS test), and they both &quot;did well&quot; on it, so he was happy about<br/>\n&gt; that, and even said &quot;I guess continue doing what you&#39;re doing, whatever<br/>\n&gt; that is&quot; (not in a detached way, but more of a &quot;I have no idea what&#39;s going<br/>\n&gt; on here, but I trust you&quot; way).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, while he sees the benefits of what the kids and I are doing, he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; having a very hard time accepting this schedule. There have been many times<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s leaving for work at 6am, and our 12yo daughter is just getting ready<br/>\n&gt; to go to bed. He feels like they&#39;re sleeping the day away, which they are,<br/>\n&gt; but I&#39;ve come to feel it&#39;s ok. He has A LOT of &#39;kids should do this and<br/>\n&gt; that&#39; from his upbringing. My upbringing was more free, so I&#39;ve always been<br/>\n&gt; the &#39;easier&#39; parent, whereas he was always &quot;we need rules, don&#39;t we?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; parent. He really tries to be open minded though. I think he also simply<br/>\n&gt; wants the kids on &quot;his&quot; schedule, so when he comes home from work, they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; awake and he can spend time w/ them. He goes to sleep by 8pm and goes to<br/>\n&gt; work at 6am, and sometimes comes home around noon, when the kids are still<br/>\n&gt; sleeping. He&#39;ll say things like &quot;I was thinking we&#39;d all go to lunch<br/>\n&gt; together, but they&#39;re sleeping&quot; and it bugs him. He&#39;d like to be able to do<br/>\n&gt; more &#39;family things&#39; when he gets home from work early (which can be a few<br/>\n&gt; days a week), but again, they&#39;re sleeping. Whether it&#39;s playing in the yard<br/>\n&gt; or going to the movies, we can&#39;t do any of it together. And we can&#39;t do it<br/>\n&gt; with him during the evening, because he&#39;s winding down getting ready for<br/>\n&gt; bed. He doesn&#39;t want to go to dinner when he has work the next day - he<br/>\n&gt; just can&#39;t enjoy it if it&#39;s late afternoon or evening time. If it were only<br/>\n&gt; me, I&#39;d be fine w/ food shopping, going out and doing things w/ the kids,<br/>\n&gt; all at night. It would be fun being &quot;night owls&quot; together. But, it&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; only me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another fear of his is seizures. Our daughter had seizures up until 4yo,<br/>\n&gt; and her first one was an hour long at 15 months old. It was a very<br/>\n&gt; difficult, stressful, scary time in our lives for many, many years. Even<br/>\n&gt; after her seizures stopped, we were &quot;waiting&quot; for the next one for years<br/>\n&gt; and years, until we could finally say &quot;we think she outgrew them&quot;. BUT, the<br/>\n&gt; doctors have always told us they could come back during puberty or during<br/>\n&gt; any stressful times in her life. They specifically said college years,<br/>\n&gt; because college students tend to stay up all night and push themselves past<br/>\n&gt; what is healthy for them, and he feels like she&#39;s doing this now (although<br/>\n&gt; she&#39;s not staying up all night, then staying awake during the day, but it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; triggering a big fear in him).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2) the kids being loud.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s more my son then my daughter, but they both contribute to the<br/>\n&gt; loudness. Mostly laughing, playing, doors opening/closing loudly, with some<br/>\n&gt; fighting (sometimes serious fighting) thrown in. My son especially just<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t remember that it&#39;s the middle of the night and hubby and I are<br/>\n&gt; sleeping. I&#39;ve talked to him about this many, many times, but it&#39;s just not<br/>\n&gt; on his mind in the middle of the night. He talks and laughs SO loudly! He<br/>\n&gt; also thinks nothing of coming in my room, flicking on the light and just<br/>\n&gt; start talking to me (at 2am). Sometimes he does this to give me goodnight<br/>\n&gt; kisses, sometimes he&#39;s telling me about a fight he and sister just had.<br/>\n&gt; Again, just no regard to it being 2am. I want to listen to him, because he<br/>\n&gt; seems to be the most open at this time, but boy am I tired. Then I&#39;m often<br/>\n&gt; cranky the next day from a lack of sleep. I can&#39;t sleep late like they do,<br/>\n&gt; the dogs and life wake me around 8am. I try to nap when I can, but I really<br/>\n&gt; hate being soooo tired.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The arguing also can escalate into physical fights. When this happens, I<br/>\n&gt; immediately get up, and then the night is over. They must go to their rooms<br/>\n&gt; when this happens. Probably once every 2 weeks this happens. I remind them<br/>\n&gt; when I&#39;m going to bed every night &quot;if you fight, you have to go to your<br/>\n&gt; rooms&quot;. I also always say things like &quot;you can disagree, just be quiet<br/>\n&gt; about it. But if you physically fight, that&#39;s it for the night&quot;. I tell<br/>\n&gt; them if they want to be able to stay up all night, they have to be mature<br/>\n&gt; enough to handle it (like not throwing a punch if you&#39;re mad about<br/>\n&gt; something).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3) when we have something to do the next day<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s more my daughter than my son, but getting them up to do things we had<br/>\n&gt; planned is sometimes difficult. My daughter takes a 3-hour art class once a<br/>\n&gt; week at 10am, and loves it. But it can be so difficult to get her up (but I<br/>\n&gt; always do, because it&#39;s a commitment). When she&#39;s fully awake, she wants to<br/>\n&gt; keep the commitment and truly loves it, and thanks me for getting her up to<br/>\n&gt; go. She&#39;s like a grumpy bear going there, and a bouncing ball of sunshine<br/>\n&gt; when I pick her up. So I really want to help her manage her time and<br/>\n&gt; schedule, so it&#39;s healthy for her (again, the seizure fear). She&#39;s always<br/>\n&gt; been the type to hate &quot;going&quot; to sleep. She always fought sleep as a baby<br/>\n&gt; and toddler, whereas my son as a toddler would declare he was tired, ask<br/>\n&gt; for a bottle, and lay himself down on the couch for a nap. As a toddler,<br/>\n&gt; she would walk into walls she was so tired, but still insist she wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; tired.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 4) I can&#39;t leave the house during the day<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I can pretty much work around this one and am usually ok w/ it, but<br/>\n&gt; resentful feelings do sometimes crop up for me, that I&#39;m &quot;trapped&quot; in the<br/>\n&gt; house (I won&#39;t leave them alone in the house when they&#39;re sleeping). Maybe<br/>\n&gt; I just need some thoughtful words here, I don&#39;t know. I very much want to<br/>\n&gt; support them in their current schedules, being they&#39;re enjoying it so much.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m looking forward to any advice anyone can offer. Thanks!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: kids staying up all night","postDate":"1341355221","msgId":68077,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpzdnNjbCtpNjRiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDRjI3NjJCMTc0RDMwOC04Q0MtMzU0OTZAd2VibWFpbC1tMDk1LnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68076,"nextInTopic":68078,"prevInTime":68076,"nextInTime":68078,"topicId":68073,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I have never had a bed time battle, which is very pleasant. I did have times that he tried to stay up as late as I do, he would lay down right where he was and crash, so I carried him to bed. It is very peaceful, my hubby was able to get overnight hours, which works really well for all of us. We turn a fan on high and try to be as quiet as possible if we get up before he does. I work from home and sometimes have to be alert which can be trying but it sure does give us the flexibility to sleep when we are tired. I have always lived by the sleep when tired, eat when hungry.... etc. It works well for us. Because we live this way it is peaceful and very comfortable. My sons friends like to stay over at our house. :-) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe go out and look at the stars and listen to the sounds of the night. The phone doesn&#39;t ring and life is really quiet at night. I have other friends that stay up like I do, sometimes they come over in the middle of the night. I bet our neighbors think we are nuts!

They both are enjoying staying up until the wee hours of the morning.  They then sleep anywhere from 10am to 3pm the next day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a little difficult for me to be totally ok mentally with it in the beginning (just &#39;old school&#39; thoughts popping up), then I read a comment about a child &#39;exploring those hours of the day&#39;, or something to that effect.  That statement helped me to see the enjoyment and exploration for them in what they were doing.  I now think it&#39;s neat they&#39;re doing this... not many people have the opportunity to do this, especially at a young age.  The independence they feel, the darkness, being just the 2 of them, it&#39;s all good (except when they fight, which I&#39;ll get to).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe challenges I&#39;m struggling with are.. <br/>\n<br/>\n1) hubby.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe was against homeschooling in the beginning, then came around (thanks to John Taylor Gatto) and now loves it. He leaves all the homeschooling up to me.  I&#39;ve explained a bit here and there about unschooling, but honestly haven&#39;t come out and said to him &quot;we&#39;re unschooling&quot;.  He sees we don&#39;t &quot;do school work&quot; anymore, and was questioning it a lot.  The kids recently had to take state tests to comply (we&#39;re in NY and I give them the homeschool friendly PASS test), and they both &quot;did well&quot; on it, so he was happy about that, and even said &quot;I guess continue doing what you&#39;re doing, whatever that is&quot; (not in a detached way, but more of a &quot;I have no idea what&#39;s going on here, but I trust you&quot; way).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, while he sees the benefits of what the kids and I are doing, he&#39;s having a very hard time accepting this schedule.  There have been many times he&#39;s leaving for work at 6am, and our 12yo daughter is just getting ready to go to bed.  He feels like they&#39;re sleeping the day away, which they are, but I&#39;ve come to feel it&#39;s ok.  He has A LOT of &#39;kids should do this and that&#39; from his upbringing.  My upbringing was more free, so I&#39;ve always been the &#39;easier&#39; parent, whereas he was always &quot;we need rules, don&#39;t we?&quot; parent.  He really tries to be open minded though.  I think he also simply wants the kids on &quot;his&quot; schedule, so when he comes home from work, they&#39;re awake and he can spend time w/ them.  He goes to sleep by 8pm and goes to work at 6am, and sometimes comes home around noon, when the kids are still sleeping.  He&#39;ll say things like &quot;I was thinking we&#39;d all go to lunch together, but they&#39;re sleeping&quot; and it bugs him.  He&#39;d like to be able to  do more &#39;family things&#39; when he gets home from work early (which can be a few days a week), but again, they&#39;re sleeping.  Whether it&#39;s playing in the yard or going to the movies, we can&#39;t do any of it together.  And we can&#39;t do it with him during the evening, because he&#39;s winding down getting ready for bed.  He doesn&#39;t want to go to dinner when he has work the next day - he just can&#39;t enjoy it if it&#39;s late afternoon or evening time.  If it were only me, I&#39;d be fine w/ food shopping, going out and doing things w/ the kids, all at night. It would be fun being &quot;night owls&quot; together.  But, it&#39;s not only me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother fear of his is seizures.  Our daughter had seizures up until 4yo, and her first one was an hour long at 15 months old.  It was a very difficult, stressful, scary time in our lives for many, many years.  Even after her seizures stopped, we were &quot;waiting&quot; for the next one for years and years, until we could finally say &quot;we think she outgrew them&quot;.  BUT, the doctors have always told us they could come back during puberty or during any stressful times in her life.  They specifically said college years, because college students tend to stay up all night and push themselves past what is healthy for them, and he feels like she&#39;s doing this now (although she&#39;s not staying up all night, then staying awake during the day, but it&#39;s triggering a big fear in him).  <br/>\n<br/>\n2) the kids being loud.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s more my son then my daughter, but they both contribute to the loudness.  Mostly laughing, playing, doors opening/closing loudly, with some fighting (sometimes serious fighting) thrown in.  My son especially just can&#39;t remember that it&#39;s the middle of the night and hubby and I are sleeping.  I&#39;ve talked to him about this many, many times, but it&#39;s just not on his mind in the middle of the night.  He talks and laughs SO loudly!  He also thinks nothing of coming in my room, flicking on the light and just start talking to me (at 2am).  Sometimes he does this to give me goodnight kisses, sometimes he&#39;s telling me about a fight he and sister just had.  Again, just no regard to it being 2am.  I want to listen to him, because he seems to be the most open at this time, but boy am I tired.  Then I&#39;m often cranky the next day from a lack of sleep.  I can&#39;t sleep late like they do, the dogs and life wake me around 8am.  I try to nap when I can, but I really hate being soooo tired.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe arguing also can escalate into physical fights.  When this happens, I immediately get up, and then the night is over.  They must go to their rooms when this happens.  Probably once every 2 weeks this happens.  I remind them when I&#39;m going to bed every night &quot;if you fight, you have to go to your rooms&quot;.  I also always say things like &quot;you can disagree, just be quiet about it.  But if you physically fight, that&#39;s it for the night&quot;.  I tell them if they want to be able to stay up all night, they have to be mature enough to handle it (like not throwing a punch if you&#39;re mad about something).  <br/>\n<br/>\n3) when we have something to do the next day<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s more my daughter than my son, but getting them up to do things we had planned is sometimes difficult.  My daughter takes a 3-hour art class once a week at 10am, and loves it.  But it can be so difficult to get her up (but I always do, because it&#39;s a commitment).

As a toddler, she would walk into walls she was so tired, but still insist she wasn&#39;t tired.  <br/>\n<br/>\n4) I can&#39;t leave the house during the day<br/>\n<br/>\nI can pretty much work around this one and am usually ok w/ it, but resentful feelings do sometimes crop up for me, that I&#39;m &quot;trapped&quot; in the house (I won&#39;t leave them alone in the house when they&#39;re sleeping).

It could also help allay some of your husband&#39;s fears.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;He&#39;ll say things like &quot;I was thinking we&#39;d all go to lunch together, but they&#39;re sleeping&quot; and it bugs him.

If they&#39;re waking up anywhere from 10-3, then it shouldn&#39;t be a big deal to get them up at noon sometimes. They can have breakfast with dad and then do something fun with him before he needs to wind down for bed. But it will be easier to do that with some planning. It&#39;s not really any different than planning around a child who naps, or has an early bedtime - so long as you think of it as a logistical puzzle rather than a conflict between right and wrong. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s another thought, though - if dad comes home unexpectedly and the kids are asleep, use the time to cuddle or get sexy! <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; We&#39;ve been homeschooling for the past 3 years, and have been working our way into unschooling over the past year (using this list and the recommended readings from it).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My 10yo son and 12yo daughter have shifted their schedules immensely in the past few months.

They specifically said college years, because college students tend to stay up all night and push themselves past what is healthy for them, and he feels like she&#39;s doing this now (although she&#39;s not staying up all night, then staying awake during the day, but it&#39;s triggering a big fear in him).  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2) the kids being loud.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s more my son then my daughter, but they both contribute to the loudness.  Mostly laughing, playing, doors opening/closing loudly, with some fighting (sometimes serious fighting) thrown in.  My son especially just can&#39;t remember that it&#39;s the middle of the night and hubby and I are sleeping.  I&#39;ve talked to him about this many, many times, but it&#39;s just not on his mind in the middle of the night.  He talks and laughs SO loudly!  He also thinks nothing of coming in my room, flicking on the light and just start talking to me (at 2am).  Sometimes he does this to give me goodnight kisses, sometimes he&#39;s telling me about a fight he and sister just had.  Again, just no regard to it being 2am.  I want to listen to him, because he seems to be the most open at this time, but boy am I tired.  Then I&#39;m often cranky the next day from a lack of sleep.  I can&#39;t sleep late like they do, the dogs and life wake me around 8am.  I try to nap when I can, but I really hate being soooo tired.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The arguing also can escalate into physical fights.  When this happens, I immediately get up, and then the night is over.  They must go to their rooms when this happens.  Probably once every 2 weeks this happens.  I remind them when I&#39;m going to bed every night &quot;if you fight, you have to go to your rooms&quot;.  I also always say things like &quot;you can disagree, just be quiet about it.  But if you physically fight, that&#39;s it for the night&quot;.  I tell them if they want to be able to stay up all night, they have to be mature enough to handle it (like not throwing a punch if you&#39;re mad about something).  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3) when we have something to do the next day<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s more my daughter than my son, but getting them up to do things we had planned is sometimes difficult.  My daughter takes a 3-hour art class once a week at 10am, and loves it.  But it can be so difficult to get her up (but I always do, because it&#39;s a commitment).  When she&#39;s fully awake, she wants to keep the commitment and truly loves it, and thanks me for getting her up to go.  She&#39;s like a grumpy bear going there, and a bouncing ball of sunshine when I pick her up.  So I really want to help her manage her time and schedule, so it&#39;s healthy for her (again, the seizure fear).  She&#39;s always been the type to hate &quot;going&quot; to sleep.  She always fought sleep as a baby and toddler, whereas my son as a toddler would declare he was tired, ask for a bottle, and lay himself down on the couch for a nap.  As a toddler, she would walk into walls she was so tired, but still insist she wasn&#39;t tired.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 4) I can&#39;t leave the house during the day<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I can pretty much work around this one and am usually ok w/ it, but resentful feelings do sometimes crop up for me, that I&#39;m &quot;trapped&quot; in the house (I won&#39;t leave them alone in the house when they&#39;re sleeping).  Maybe I just need some thoughtful words here, I don&#39;t know.  I very much want to support them in their current schedules, being they&#39;re enjoying it so much.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m looking forward to any advice anyone can offer.  Thanks!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":440291924,"authorName":"Liz","from":"&quot;Liz&quot; &lt;lizjane68@...&gt;","profile":"lizmikeerinryan","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"kids staying up all night","postDate":"1341326356","msgId":68073,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpzdjA2aytnbTNmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":68074,"prevInTime":68072,"nextInTime":68074,"topicId":68073,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We ve been homeschooling for the past 3 years, and have been working our way into unschooling over the past year (using this list and the recommended readings","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2029548336\">We&#39;ve been homeschooling for the past 3 years, and have been working our way into unschooling over the past year (using this list and the recommended readings from it).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 10yo son and 12yo daughter have shifted their schedules immensely in the past few months.  They both are enjoying staying up until the wee hours of the morning.  They then sleep anywhere from 10am to 3pm the next day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a little difficult for me to be totally ok mentally with it in the beginning (just &#39;old school&#39; thoughts popping up), then I read a comment about a child &#39;exploring those hours of the day&#39;, or something to that effect.  That statement helped me to see the enjoyment and exploration for them in what they were doing.  I now think it&#39;s neat they&#39;re doing this... not many people have the opportunity to do this, especially at a young age.  The independence they feel, the darkness, being just the 2 of them, it&#39;s all good (except when they fight, which I&#39;ll get to).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe challenges I&#39;m struggling with are.. <br/>\n<br/>\n1) hubby.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe was against homeschooling in the beginning, then came around (thanks to John Taylor Gatto) and now loves it. He leaves all the homeschooling up to me.  I&#39;ve explained a bit here and there about unschooling, but honestly haven&#39;t come out and said to him &quot;we&#39;re unschooling&quot;.  He sees we don&#39;t &quot;do school work&quot; anymore, and was questioning it a lot.  The kids recently had to take state tests to comply (we&#39;re in NY and I give them the homeschool friendly PASS test), and they both &quot;did well&quot; on it, so he was happy about that, and even said &quot;I guess continue doing what you&#39;re doing, whatever that is&quot; (not in a detached way, but more of a &quot;I have no idea what&#39;s going on here, but I trust you&quot; way).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, while he sees the benefits of what the kids and I are doing, he&#39;s having a very hard time accepting this schedule.  There have been many times he&#39;s leaving for work at 6am, and our 12yo daughter is just getting ready to go to bed.  He feels like they&#39;re sleeping the day away, which they are, but I&#39;ve come to feel it&#39;s ok.  He has A LOT of &#39;kids should do this and that&#39; from his upbringing.  My upbringing was more free, so I&#39;ve always been the &#39;easier&#39; parent, whereas he was always &quot;we need rules, don&#39;t we?&quot; parent.  He really tries to be open minded though.  I think he also simply wants the kids on &quot;his&quot; schedule, so when he comes home from work, they&#39;re awake and he can spend time w/ them.  He goes to sleep by 8pm and goes to work at 6am, and sometimes comes home around noon, when the kids are still sleeping.  He&#39;ll say things like &quot;I was thinking we&#39;d all go to lunch together, but they&#39;re sleeping&quot; and it bugs him.  He&#39;d like to be able to do more &#39;family things&#39; when he gets home from work early (which can be a few days a week), but again, they&#39;re sleeping.  Whether it&#39;s playing in the yard or going to the movies, we can&#39;t do any of it together.  And we can&#39;t do it with him during the evening, because he&#39;s winding down getting ready for bed.  He doesn&#39;t want to go to dinner when he has work the next day - he just can&#39;t enjoy it if it&#39;s late afternoon or evening time.  If it were only me, I&#39;d be fine w/ food shopping, going out and doing things w/ the kids, all at night. It would be fun being &quot;night owls&quot; together.  But, it&#39;s not only me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother fear of his is seizures.  Our daughter had seizures up until 4yo, and her first one was an hour long at 15 months old.  It was a very difficult, stressful, scary time in our lives for many, many years.  Even after her seizures stopped, we were &quot;waiting&quot; for the next one for years and years, until we could finally say &quot;we think she outgrew them&quot;.  BUT, the doctors have always told us they could come back during puberty or during any stressful times in her life.
