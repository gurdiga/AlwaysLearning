I doubt that the 3 yr old will be able to play because most take some reading and boys that little won&#39;t have developed enough hand/eye coordination.  Plus his hands may be too small.  You might get him a toy with buttons and pictures that resembles a Gameboy.

The color gameboy can play any of the monochromatic games, but <br/>\nI&#39;m not sure it works the other way around.  Maybe someone out there <br/>\nknows.  The different color cases on the gameboys don&#39;t mean anything <br/>\nexcept that the person who bought it likes blue, or red or yellow, or <br/>\nwhatever color the best.  It&#39;s like a color on a car.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome games need extra memory, but most don&#39;t.  Check out the bionicle game <br/>\nthe next time you&#39;re in target/wherever and see if the packaging says it&#39;ll <br/>\nneed extra.  Its the best way to tell.  the boy sometimes likes his &#39;light&#39; <br/>\nthat attaches to the gameboy and lights up the screen so he can play when <br/>\nit&#39;s dark.  His game came with an &#39;accessory pack&#39; package and that&#39;s about <br/>\nthe only thing he uses from the pack.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy boy LOVES his gameboy and won&#39;t go on a long car trip without it.  We <br/>\nfrequently get him a new game when we start out on *really* long trips <br/>\n(usually of more than 10 hours).  He would not do well having to share it, <br/>\nbecause the minute he sees someone else playing one, he wants to play <br/>\nhis.  That might be unique to my boy, though.<br/>\nHeidi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10650,"nextTopicId":10666}}
