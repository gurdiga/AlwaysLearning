But they (&quot;Marsh&quot; is our<br/>\nlocal delivery grocery store) have never brought me any bad veggies or meats<br/>\nand the expirations dates are in line with what I would choose normailly..<br/>\nI can also select &quot;no substitutions&quot;on any item I order.  I rarely do this<br/>\nbecause if they don&#39;t have something I ordered they usually do a great job<br/>\nsubstituting it with a similar brand or larger size.<br/>\nOne of the coolest parts is that when I log onto their website www.Marsh.net<br/>\nI can use my &quot;quick shopper list&quot; which is a running list of all items I<br/>\nhave ever ordered from them or I can search the database or browse the<br/>\nstore.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf/when we move from the city I will miss this the most.<br/>\nBut  I can also choose to order online then pick-up my own groceries at a<br/>\nspecified time and store location for about $4.  This works well for people<br/>\nwho work in the city but don&#39;t live in the delivery area.  So this may be an<br/>\noption if we move to the country, hubby could pick up on his way home but<br/>\nstill not have to shop at the store.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve rambled on again!
