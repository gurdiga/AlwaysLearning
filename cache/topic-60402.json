You set it up with their age and then it gives them access to a huge selection of games from a wide variety of sites such as Nick jr and starfall and cbeebies etc. for my daughter its great because she really values her independence on the computer and loves clicking on loads of different games. This site doesn&#39;t show all the little ads for other games that she often clicks on and ends up at less suitable sites to say the least but at the same time there is a huge  choice of games from many of her favourite sites. Plus if there are sites not included that I know she loves there is  a way to add them to her zoodles set up. You can also add any of the other zoodles games to her account even if they are considered suitable for a different age.<br/>\nYou can get it as an app for your phone as well and when its on it locks your other keys so they can&#39;t accidentally ring out but you can answer the phone if it rings. Thats been great when we are out and about.<br/>\nFor us it answered her need for a wide range of games from all different places and her desire not to have us sitting there checking where she was clicking next.<br/>\nIt does offer reporting facilities to the parents for what sort of games they play on most each week but I never look at that. The ones she plays on most go into a favourites area.<br/>\nThere is a paid for version but we have only used the free one and its been great.<br/>\nOther than that cbeebies, nick jr and poisson rouge have all been massive hits with her. <br/>\nJo<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ann-Marie&quot; &lt;annmariehorsley1@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi everyone,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My son, who is almost 3, has recently begun playing online games on our computer.
