Her question and part of my answer:<br/>\n<br/>\n––––––––––––––––––––<br/>\nIn your question you said:  ”The parents think they are actually being kind and forming the child’s character and will.”<br/>\n<br/>\nParents never, ever form a child’s will. They can attempt to break it, but they can no more create a will than they can make a tree grow in any other way than planting the seed and nurturing the sprout. One’s will is inherent. You can’t plant an oak and grow an apple tree.<br/>\n––––––––––––––––––––<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mommy-labs.com/holistic_living/sandra-dodd-interview-how-do-unschoolers-cope-with-college-questions-on-learning-without-school-living-joyfully/\">http://www.mommy-labs.com/holistic_living/sandra-dodd-interview-how-do-unschoolers-cope-with-college-questions-on-learning-without-school-living-joyfully/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing was on facebook, an image from a Waldorf school anti-TV demonstration.   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/t/steinerScreen.jpg\">http://sandradodd.com/t/steinerScreen.jpg</a><br/>\nOne of the effects listed there is &quot;switched off will.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think one&#39;s will &quot;switches off.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69265,"nextTopicId":69355}}
