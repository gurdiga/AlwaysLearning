My response is at the bottom.   <br/>\nMaybe don&#39;t respond to this one, but to the topics I will sort out  <br/>\nand post separately.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n================================<br/>\nDo you have something pre-written- somewhere... where you talk about  <br/>\nhow to switch the switch on the child who is used to being<br/>\nguided through the day by the parents who mean well but have been  <br/>\ninconsistent and maybe messed up!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n  ....read below a little about what I mean.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is..... we (parents ) TRY  very hard to refrain from comments  <br/>\nabout not practicing piano and using the computer too much  and  <br/>\neating easy sweets instead of  other foods.....but we mess up. We are  <br/>\n2 parents with slightly differing approaches.. One parent constantly  <br/>\nreminds the kids to brush their teeth and the other lets them  <br/>\nremember on their own One parent reminds the child that its bedtime.   <br/>\nWe remind the kids that practicing music is required because the  <br/>\nmusic lessons cost money and on and on.....<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter ( 12 and never been to school )  still asks me what is  <br/>\nhappening today instead of making her day happen .When  I suggest an  <br/>\nactivity she likes the idea... but is not the one to think of it  <br/>\nfirst... like call a friend over or go out to play tennis.  She is  <br/>\nused to having choices offered to her instead of knowing that she has  <br/>\nALL the choices available. That, I&#39;m sure, is my fault as the one who  <br/>\nhas always been the leader of the pack. Wanna go for a bike ride?  &quot;  <br/>\nsure &quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know she loves to go to the pool club but she does not ask but  <br/>\nrather says OK when I ask her if she would like to call a friend and  <br/>\nhead over to the pool.<br/>\nOr when I say, wanna play tennis.... she says OK.  ...Not usually  <br/>\nthinking of it for herself.  If I say nothing- she DOES use the  <br/>\ncomputer to play Runescape but I know she loves hunting for mushrooms  <br/>\nand bike riding and swimming and hanging out at the river.  It  <br/>\nappears that she is waiting for those activities to happen...<br/>\nnot making them happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... MY thoughts revert to .. Well, I guess she really doesn&#39;t want  <br/>\nto do these things that badly or she would have asked.<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure how to help her to feel empowered.. Have I totally  <br/>\nmessed her up?  Can this be remedied? Can this be un- done?<br/>\n================================<br/>\n<br/>\nMy/Sandra&#39;s first response:<br/>\n================================<br/>\nAll these things have been discussed, but much of the discussion is  <br/>\nprobably still in archives.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome things you might want to look at are<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/nest\">http://sandradodd.com/nest</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/sleeping\">http://sandradodd.com/sleeping</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/deschooling\">http://sandradodd.com/deschooling</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/music/\">http://sandradodd.com/music/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to take the questions to the list without your name, and  <br/>\nyou&#39;ll get better answers there from lots of people, and the answers  <br/>\nI write will benefit lots of people.<br/>\n<br/>\n==================================================<br/>\n<br/>\nIf any of you feel like searching archives of this or  <br/>\nUnschoolingDiscussion and bringing a link to prior discussions, that  <br/>\nwould be very cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29563,"nextTopicId":29548}}
