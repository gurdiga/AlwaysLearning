It always seems like everything is just a guess and I feel like I <br/>\ncould probably get just as much information off the internet or from <br/>\nsome of my own medical books. I had tendonitis in my foot last spring <br/>\nand the nurse practitioner told me that because I was nursing I should <br/>\ntake frequent, high doses of Tylenol because at that amount it would <br/>\nhave an anti-inflamitory effect. She said I shouldn&#39;t take Advil, which <br/>\nIS an anti-inflamitory, because of my nursing. That&#39;s just ridiculous. <br/>\nIf one Tylenol doesn&#39;t have the ability to bring down swelling due to <br/>\nthe very nature of its ingredients, a whole bottleful isn&#39;t going to cut <br/>\nit either. Besides, if Advil is so bad for babies, why do they make <br/>\nInfant&#39;s Advil???<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion: What do you call the person who placed last on their medical <br/>\nexams?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnswer: Doctor.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi<br/>\n<br/>\nheasue2003 wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Thought I would share this with you all.  My son is going on 8 <br/>\n&gt;months.  About three weeks ago he started to run a high temp&. 103.5 <br/>\n&gt;after Tylenol and Motrin. I would usually take him to our <br/>\n&gt;pediatrician about 25 miles from where we live, but we were snowed <br/>\n&gt;in.  I made an appointment with a Dr I knew at our local McFarland <br/>\n&gt;clinic.  The Dr. diagnosed him with the flu and told me to wait it <br/>\n&gt;out.  I took Brandon back to the Dr.s a second time (still snowed in) <br/>\n&gt;because he was getting congested.  Same diagnoses and promises of a <br/>\n&gt;recovery real soon plus a prescription for an antihistamine with <br/>\n&gt;codeine.  I was concerned about giving my son the codeine.  He <br/>\n&gt;guaranteed me that it was fine.  I took him back a third time (all in <br/>\n&gt;a week or so time) because I wanted to make sure that Brandon wasn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;getting pneumonia.  He told me everything looked great and that I <br/>\n&gt;should be giving him the codeine to help him sleep at night.  I had <br/>\n&gt;only been giving it to him when he seemed really distressed and we <br/>\n&gt;had been up for a while trying to get him to sleep.  Anyways.  Then a <br/>\n&gt;few days later (cough mostly gone, fever lower.)  Brandon develops <br/>\n&gt;pink eye.  Mind you I never once took my son our daughter out of the <br/>\n&gt;house during that week. I think Brandon got pink eye from poor hand <br/>\n&gt;washing on the Dr.s part.  Soooo, by this time the roads are clear, <br/>\n&gt;my daughter is complaining of and earache and I make an appointment <br/>\n&gt;for her to be seen by our Pediatrician and ask the Dr. to look at <br/>\n&gt;Brandon&#39;s eyes. Chelsea has two ear infections.  He looked at Brandon <br/>\n&gt;eyes&. Pink eye.  He looked in his left ear&.. severe ear infection, <br/>\n&gt;in his right her&&& ear infection.  The pediatrician thinks that my <br/>\n&gt;son never had the flu, but had an upper respiratory infection that <br/>\n&gt;lead to ear infections that was missed three times by our local <br/>\n&gt;Dr.!!!!  So, this whole time I have been sedating my son because I <br/>\n&gt;thought he was uncomfortable from the flu when what his real problem <br/>\n&gt;was an ear infection!
