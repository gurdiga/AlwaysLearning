I was hoping to get some advice from you guys  <br/>\nas I try to reach my cousins son. Poor Landon has dealt with a lot,  <br/>\nalready a quirky kid, he&#39;s the son of military family. His parents  <br/>\nlove him a lot, but he does get razzed a lot about his hyperactive  <br/>\ntendencies, his nonsports, computer-loving self. They try to  <br/>\nencourage him, I know, but it&#39;s hard for my cousin and his wife (Lord  <br/>\nknows they do better than my vicious aunt, his grandmother). My CIL  <br/>\nhas really been a good advocate for him in the schools, but whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I only see the guy once a year, and yesterday was it. This  <br/>\ntime I plan on staying in touch through letters (and maybe email if  <br/>\nhe trusts me enough with it later) He&#39;s fifteen and for two years now  <br/>\nhas been really into renderings, he&#39;s really GREAT at it, and even  <br/>\nbetter, is so passionate about it. He spent two hours yesterday  <br/>\nshowing me online the ones he&#39;s done, the programs he uses, and you  <br/>\ncould tell he really appreciated me listening. His grandmother and my  <br/>\nother cousin, his aunt, would look at them and say &quot;Those are good,  <br/>\nyou should keep doing this to make a lot of money&quot;, and his dad would  <br/>\nwalk in and though he was appreciative of the work Landon did, would  <br/>\nimmediately start in &quot;Why isn&#39;t your name on this one&quot;, or &quot;Why is  <br/>\nthat one so blurry?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;d like to mail him and tell him that I really enjoyed the  <br/>\ntime listening to him. Even more, i want to encourage him to follow  <br/>\nhis passion and not worry about money or fame, but to measure success  <br/>\nby his own joy. He&#39;s fifteen, and has been through so much crap,  <br/>\nverbally and physically assaulted by other base brats, moved around  <br/>\nso much that he doesn&#39;t have too many friends, tortured by his  <br/>\n&#39;perfect&#39; little sister (totally fits into the lifestyle, cutesie  <br/>\nlittle cheerleader etc, who is really sweet and loving, but hard to  <br/>\nlive up to, KWIM?) any advice on how to encourage someone who is not  <br/>\nyour own, stuck in school, but such a cool kid (he&#39;s a great self- <br/>\nlearner)<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (8), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (4), Dan  <br/>\n(2), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26216,"nextTopicId":26223}}
