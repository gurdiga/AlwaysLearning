I think the parents, in probably most cases, felt they knew which would be the best field for their children to apprentice in and they made arrangements a bit like arranged marriages.  It wasn&#39;t necessarily a case of children&#39;s interests being considered.  I like that in your case, Sandra, you and your child were on the look-out for something that the child might enjoy, and I&#39;m sure she would have been able to say, &quot;well, thanks, mom, but I&#39;m not sure flowers are really my thing&quot; or whatever and that would be it.  Not so in early times apprenticeships, I don&#39;t think :) What I really like was that this scenario offered something for all parties involved -- a win-win situation, if you will.  The store is being offered cash, taking any perceived risk out of it for them; and because of that, if your child didn&#39;t care for this line of work after a bit, she also wouldn&#39;t have to feel that she &quot;owed&quot; the store anything, nor would you.  I think this particular set-up, where it is a loose agreement between just a couple of people, is rather optimal.  It occurs to me after hearing about it, that there may be any number of businesses and trades that might consider something like this, if someone approached them casually.  Not everyone perceives themselves as a mentor or teacher to others and might not be willing to sign up for any state program or anything, but I would think there are a lot of people who do have something they know how to do well and who would be willing to consider this situation on a casual basis.  Kind of a &quot;let&#39;s see if it might be something we would enjoy&quot; type thing. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Nobody &quot;had to&quot; do anything, and that makes the whole thing pleasant and happy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is exactly what I like about it and why it struck me as so brilliant.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: gaining skills by offering to apprentice","postDate":"1240234429","msgId":44171,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVFMDE2ODE2LTM0MjktNDdBNC05OEJGLUM4MEY5QjdDODcxN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGQyZS4zZTk2NDhkMy4zNzFhMTRhZkBhb2wuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGQyZS4zZTk2NDhkMy4zNzFhMTRhZkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44170,"nextInTopic":44172,"prevInTime":44170,"nextInTime":44172,"topicId":44088,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I guess it s a glimmer of hope that, somewhere in a tiny corner of the powers-that-be, there s some recognition that school is not everything. -=- I doubt","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1566317023\">-=-I guess it&#39;s a glimmer of hope that, somewhere in a tiny corner of  <br/>\nthe<br/>\npowers-that-be, there&#39;s some recognition that school is not  <br/>\neverything. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI doubt it was the idea of the schools, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nApprenticeship is the old-time way.
