The difficulty that they are experiencing is that they are at different levels and are having a hard time playing together.  Incidently we have 2 wii&#39;s in the house but unfortunately one is a modified one that we bought with burned games and so they dont work on the one upstairs....only Lego starwars works on both machines.  Justin (the older one) is of course very set on completing the game and figuring out the puzzles whereas the younger one is focussed on changing his character and jumping around and will go backwards through the doors he has just come in etc.  They both get extremely frustrated with each other.  Justin has started saying that he hates his younger brother and Jordan mainly expresses his frustration by screaming at Justin.  Here are some of the ways that I have tried to help them through this situation:<br/>\n<br/>\nI sit between them and play with them a lot of the time....I was with them for most of the afternoon and a good part of the evening - Justin was still getting really angry but I was able to diffuse the situation by helping Jordie to understand the drop out function for when Justin really needed to be able to do something and also help Jordan to get what he needed when he wanted to change characters or just explore something.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have tried encouraging them to play on separate Wiis for a time - but that doesn&#39;t always work because they both want to play the same game or don&#39;t want to be lonely<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also tried to encourage Justin to just have fun with it when Jordie is around and wait until he is playing with Hessel or I to really try to finish the game....this sometimes is effective but most of the time he finds this really hard to do <br/>\n<br/>\nI have also unfortunately gotten short with them when they have been really bickering...and I don&#39;t think this is a solution at all!  My husband....who is not quite as far along in our new ways of doing things will just arbitrarily turn the game off and declare a break without really trying to help them work through it because he has had enough.  (My husband is actually a really patient guy normally)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo anyway - I&#39;m sure there are other things that I have tried to do but they aren&#39;t coming to mind right now....<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m open to suggestions,<br/>\n<br/>\nTIA,<br/>\n<br/>\nRuth Suyamin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48366,"nextTopicId":48172}}
