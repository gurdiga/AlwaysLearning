Cover","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-414755249\">Thanks Julie<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout 2lb ( a mess) fresh, WASHED, locally grown<br/>\ncollards (local may be the difference), cut up with<br/>\nmost of the thick center vein removed. Cover with<br/>\nwater in a pot big enough to hold them all, add a glop<br/>\nof vegetable oil (fat back or bacon  is<br/>\ntraditional....but so is arteriosclerosis), I use<br/>\ncanola. Salt, black pepper, and about 1 quarter cup of<br/>\nsugar (honey has a nice flavor, too...bet your thyme<br/>\nhoney would be good and would make it yours). Stir it<br/>\nall together and boil, reduce heat, simmer until they<br/>\nare how as tender as you prefer.  I like mine with<br/>\nvinegar (various kinds) DH likes his with corn-bread<br/>\ncrumbled or broken in chunks and salsa and LOTS of<br/>\nSeminole Seasoning (a salt substitute with salt in<br/>\nit)or hot sauce and Seminole Seasoning. Roy, and his<br/>\nbrothers, and most kids, like theirs, as is.  Left<br/>\novers can be frozen in the juice and zapped later, or<br/>\nheated on the stove top.  Old country folks save the<br/>\npot liquor (the juice) and drink it as a beverage. <br/>\nCollards are high in everything, including calcium,<br/>\niron, anti-oxidants, B vitamins, ruffage (give some<br/>\nfolks gas, but it is the same people who get gas with<br/>\nbrocoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and all the rest) and<br/>\nother good stuff I don&#39;t really know about...a little<br/>\nK and ????<br/>\n<br/>\nAdrian had a good appetite! and secure enough to be<br/>\nwilling to try new foods. <br/>\n<br/>\nSharon of the Swamp<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Julie Stauffer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jnjstau@...\">jnjstau@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;&lt;his salads are tasty and interesting&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Must get it from his Mama.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have tried and tried to recreate your greens<br/>\n&gt; recipe.
