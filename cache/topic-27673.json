We <br/>\nwere in the U.S. at the time, so the video wasn&#39;t available. But in the UK <br/>\nthere are lots of Hairy Maclary things. She loved Slinky Malinki (and <br/>\nlooking at Lynley Dodd&#39;s page there is a new Slinky Malinki book out that <br/>\nmaybe I&#39;ll just get) as well. The rhythm of it was so wonderful. Can you get <br/>\nmore stuff like whatever the video is? Can you get the Hairy Maclary stuffed <br/>\nanimals? or books and put them out where your son will see them? there&#39;s a <br/>\ncoloring book at amazon.co.uk that you could do with him? Instead of seeing <br/>\nthis love of the video as a bad thing can you expand on it? Can you find <br/>\nother videos that have a similiar pattern, cadence to them?<br/>\n<br/>\nHe loves this thing. He loves it enough to want to memorize it, make it a <br/>\npart of him, consume it utterly. I don&#39;t think that you should be looking to <br/>\nseparate him from this love, instead you should find ways of helping him <br/>\nsatiate his desire. And maybe by showing him more facets of something like <br/>\nthe world of Hairy Maclary of Donaldson&#39;s dairy you will be doing just that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n- why haven&#39;t I mentioned any of the shows he loves - yes, I did,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Hairy McLairy, perhaps not familiar to you in the US? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27641,"nextTopicId":27675}}
