I rarely cook for more than 30 minutes as we live on pasta, rice, stir fries. All home made but it just doesn&#39;t take long. When I&#39;m feeling lazy they have beans on toast. the older 3 often make their own meals now although I will remind them about the need for fruit and vegetables. B would live on plain pasta with tomato ketchup stirred in for ever!<br/>\n  C can&#39;t eat pasta so she gets mashed up advocado&#39;s or mashed sweet potato.<br/>\n  I can no longer imagine a meal that takes hours to prpare!<br/>\n  Looking forward to the cleaning one. I hate cleaning with a passion and do less than an hour a day. I make sure the kitchen is clean, vacuum the &#39;lived in&#39; floor and ignore everything else. There will be time when I&#39;m old with nothing else to do ;-)<br/>\n  My goal is to get a dishwasher but do they really save time?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  S<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:autismhelp@...\">autismhelp@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  As I stated several days (or weeks? time flies when you&#39;re having  <br/>\nfun) ago, I had some ideas for parents who need to just walk away  <br/>\nfrom cooking.
