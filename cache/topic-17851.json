Of, course the <br/>\nchild may prefer to write a book about what they know for their <br/>\nyounger brothers birthday present, or even video tape a skit, or <br/>\nrecord a song. Of course, there will be 1 teacher in each classroom <br/>\nfor every five children in attendence.<br/>\n<br/>\n12:00 pm: lunch, outside (during good weather) followed by a walk <br/>\nthrough town so kids can talk and enjoy themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfternoon: Class starts at 2:00pm.<br/>\nExpiramentation, tied in with math and Language arts, at the very <br/>\nleast.

They will each be provided with a notebook, <br/>\npencils and crayons for a nature journal. They can write info, draw, <br/>\nwrite poetry or a story, whatever moves them at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nClasses end at four, we encourage older siblings to pick children up <br/>\nafter school, or the parents if possible.

If there is any <br/>\n&gt; reason why I homeschool, this may be it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Teleah<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Silence required at elementary school<br/>\n&gt; 11:08 AM EST on Sunday, January 11, 2004<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Associated Press<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; COLUMBIA, S.C. -- At Meadowfield Elementary School, silence isn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; only golden, it&#39;s the rule. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A committee of teachers and parents came up with guideline for <br/>\n&gt; silent hallways and lunchrooms, they say, to stem bad behavior and <br/>\n&gt; curb inappropriate conversations by students. The rule began when <br/>\n&gt; students returned from winter break last week. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The school&#39;s 600-or-so students who used to gab with friends now <br/>\n&gt; read books while waiting for classes to start and listen to <br/>\n&gt; classical music in hallways and the cafeteria. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lisa Curtis, the Meadowfield teacher who chaired the committee, said <br/>\n&gt; students have shown less control of themselves the last few years. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Even parents were saying that it seems a little more chaotic in the <br/>\n&gt; halls. You could tell the climate was changing and we needed to <br/>\n&gt; change with it,&quot; she said. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Some parents, though, say the zip-the-lips policy goes too far. <br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s a meeting to discuss the policy Monday. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;This is going overboard,&quot; said Billy Smith, a father of two <br/>\n&gt; Meadowfield students. &quot;I grew up talking to my friends during lunch <br/>\n&gt; and using those socialization skills. Kids need that.&quot; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;What about the ones that do their work and behave appropriately in <br/>\n&gt; school?&quot; asked Lee Crabtree, mother of a Meadowfield fourth-<br/>\n&gt; grader. &quot;They&#39;re being punished, too.&quot; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Officials say that if students do a good job keeping quiet, they&#39;ll <br/>\n&gt; be allowed to whisper. And students will be taught what are <br/>\n&gt; appropriate conversations for school. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Not everyone knows what it means to whisper,&quot; said Paula Stephens, <br/>\n&gt; the school&#39;s principal. &quot;But everyone knows what silence is. We&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; starting with that as our baseline.&quot; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Stephens says Meadowfield&#39;s lunch is only 20 minutes. She says most <br/>\n&gt; schools don&#39;t allow talking in hallways. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Plans call for the Meadowfield to put up a traffic light in the <br/>\n&gt; cafeteria. Green means students can talk. Yellow means things are <br/>\n&gt; getting too loud. Red means silence. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Curtis said many teachers are happy with the change. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s amazing how well it&#39;s working,&quot; she said. &quot;The learning <br/>\n&gt; environment is better. The students are being more polite. There&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; no bickering. I&#39;m so proud of them.&quot; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
