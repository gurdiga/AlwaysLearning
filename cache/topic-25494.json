If things are always broken<br/>\ninto short working periods. <br/>\nIf myself and others are allowed to break into their<br/>\nconcentration. <br/>\nIf bells and I are always in control of the pace and<br/>\nflow of work <br/>\nHow will they learn to continue their own work? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf all the marking and editing is done by me. <br/>\nIf the selection of which work is to be published or<br/>\nevaluated is made by me. <br/>\nIf what is valued and valuable is always decided by<br/>\nexternal sources or by me. <br/>\nIf there is no forum to discuss what delights them in<br/>\ntheir task, what is working, what is not working, what<br/>\nthey plan to do about it. <br/>\nIf they have not learned a language to discuss their<br/>\nwork in ways that are intrinsically growth enhancing. <br/>\nIf they do not have a language of self-assessment. <br/>\nIf ways of communicating their work are always<br/>\ncontrolled by me. <br/>\nIf our assessments are mainly summative rather than<br/>\nformative. <br/>\nIf they do not plan their way forward to further<br/>\naction. <br/>\nHow will they find ownership, direction and delight in<br/>\nwhat they do? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I speak of individuals but present learning as if<br/>\nthey are all the same. <br/>\nIf I am never seen to reflect and reflection time is<br/>\nnever provided. <br/>\nIf we never speak together about reflection and<br/>\nthinking and never develop a vocabulary for such<br/>\ndiscussion. <br/>\nIf we do not take opportunities to think about our<br/>\nthinking. <br/>\nIf I constantly set them exercises that do not<br/>\nintellectually challenge them. <br/>\nIf I set up learning environments that interfere with<br/>\nthem learning from their own actions. <br/>\nIf I give them recipes to follow. <br/>\nIf I only expect the one right conclusion. <br/>\nIf I signify that there are always right and wrong<br/>\nanswers. <br/>\nIf I never openly respect their thoughts. <br/>\nIf I never let them persevere with something really<br/>\ndifficult which they cannot master. <br/>\nIf I make all work serious work and discourage<br/>\nplayfulness. <br/>\nIf there is no time to explore. <br/>\nIf I lock them into adult time constraints too early. <br/>\nHow will they get to know themselves as a thinker? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf they never get to help anyone else. <br/>\nIf we force them to always work and play with children<br/>\nof the same age. <br/>\nIf I do not teach them the skills of working<br/>\nco-operatively. <br/>\nIf collaboration can be seen as cheating. <br/>\nIf all classroom activities are based in<br/>\ncompetitiveness. <br/>\nIf everything is seen to be for marks. <br/>\nHow will they learn to work with others? <br/>\n<br/>\nFor if they <br/>\nhave never experienced being challenged in a safe<br/>\nenvironment. <br/>\nhave had all of their creative thoughts explained<br/>\naway. <br/>\nare unaware what catches their interest and how then<br/>\nto have confidence in that interest. <br/>\nhave never followed something they are passionate<br/>\nabout to a satisfying conclusion. <br/>\nhave not clarified the way they sabotage their own<br/>\nlearning. <br/>\nare afraid to seek help and do not know who or how to<br/>\nask. <br/>\nhave not experienced overcoming their own inertia. <br/>\nare paralysed by the need to know everything before<br/>\nwriting or acting. <br/>\nhave never got bogged down. <br/>\nhave never failed. <br/>\nhave always played it safe. <br/>\nHow will they ever know who they are? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25401,"nextTopicId":25514}}
