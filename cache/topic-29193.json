We&#39;ve been into <br/>\n  &gt; the King Of Knives store (while we were in Sydney) and he found a <br/>\n  &gt; sword letter opener that he wants to buy. This would be safe as <br/>\n  it&#39;s <br/>\n  &gt; not really sharp. We&#39;re talking about getting a small pocket knife <br/>\n  as <br/>\n  &gt; well. My dad has found him an antique scythe that he&#39;s going to <br/>\n  hang <br/>\n  &gt; up on his wall in his room and we&#39;ve been to Allens and got a nice <br/>\n  &gt; new knife set for the kitchen which includes a meat cleaver <br/>\n  &gt; (something he&#39;s loved for awhile now).

As much as I possibly can I have been nurturing <br/>\nthis interest. I&#39;m finding it difficult though because of the safety <br/>\nissues involved. He likes the look of sharp blades and is interested <br/>\nin what they&#39;re used for. He constantly admires the ones in our <br/>\nkitchen drawers and gets them out and puts them on our bread boards <br/>\nto look at.I&#39;m very present with him when he&#39;s handling the knives <br/>\nand have given lots of info about how to handle them safely etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a couple of things that concern me. One is the reactions <br/>\nI&#39;m getting from others who aren&#39;t understanding why he&#39;d be <br/>\ninterested in something like a knife. They have alot of fear about it <br/>\n(which I totally understand)  and have questioned him and me about <br/>\nwhy the interest is there. The other is my concern for his safety and <br/>\nthe safety of others if he happens to show them the knives. I trust <br/>\nthat he won&#39;t do anything dangerous with them on purpose and again, <br/>\nI&#39;m very present when this is happening, but am worried nonetheless, <br/>\nthat an accident could happen. Not sure where my boundaries need to <br/>\nbe with it all. I&#39;ve talked to him about the inportance of not <br/>\nwalking around with them etc and that the drawer is a really safe <br/>\nspot for them unless we&#39;re cutting up vegies etc with them. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe also desperately wants to purchase big types of knives -at the <br/>\nmoment it&#39;s  a machette. We&#39;ve had lots of discussion about this, and <br/>\nthat will continue. I&#39;m really feeling like I need to say no to alot <br/>\nof these sorts of things though because of his age. We&#39;ve been into <br/>\nthe King Of Knives store (while we were in Sydney) and he found a <br/>\nsword letter opener that he wants to buy. This would be safe as it&#39;s <br/>\nnot really sharp. We&#39;re talking about getting a small pocket knife as <br/>\nwell. My dad has found him an antique scythe that he&#39;s going to hang <br/>\nup on his wall in his room and we&#39;ve been to Allens and got a nice <br/>\nnew knife set for the kitchen which includes a meat cleaver <br/>\n(something he&#39;s loved for awhile now). I&#39;m feeling like I&#39;m doing as <br/>\nmuch as I can to help him get what he needs but the machette etc <br/>\nfeels like it&#39;s way too much at the moment. He&#39;s very upset about my <br/>\ndecision and my saying no to it. I guess I just needed to hear what <br/>\nsome of your thoughts are on this and whether I could handle this in <br/>\na much better way.<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks so much<br/>\n<br/>\nKim</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29226,"nextTopicId":29167}}
