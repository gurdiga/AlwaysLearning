He is a<br/>\nfundamental Christian who believes in his own self<br/>\nrighteousness more than in the teachings of his faith.<br/>\n He is a hate monger.  What if he ever has a crisis of<br/>\nfaith?  What might he be capable of?  He firmly<br/>\nbelieves that the only think keeping human beings from<br/>\ncommitting crimes against each other is the fear of<br/>\nHell and the righteous wrath of the judgemental god<br/>\nthat he prays to.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two kinds of Chrisitan God, and you can<br/>\nusually tell by a person&#39;a action which type they<br/>\nbelieve in.  There is the forgiving all father, the<br/>\nloving and peaceful Christ who loves all equally. <br/>\nThen there is the fire and brimstone judgement<br/>\nbringer, who casts out the unworthy and shuns the<br/>\nnon-white, oppressing women and heaping sin upon<br/>\nhumanity.  I say those who embrace that second vision<br/>\nof the Christian God are full of guilt and shame<br/>\nthemselves, and crave punishment.
