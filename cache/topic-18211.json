In theory this should be a<br/>\ngood thing, but digestive biscuits are freakin&#39; tiny,<br/>\nand so molten marshmallow oozes all over your hand.<br/>\nMeanwhile, the Toblerone is too thick to melt evenly<br/>\nunder the same molten marshmallow, so you have a big<br/>\nchunk of unmelted Toblerone, which compromises the<br/>\nstructural integrity of the s&#39;more (sorry, encore). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe bad news is that you are left grumpy, blistered<br/>\nand snack fodder for any bear that smells the<br/>\nchocolate.
