I m","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1874128904\">Thanks Deborah. I have to think about this one. If the idea of getting a job<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t come from my teenagers, are you suggesting that we give them the<br/>\nidea? I&#39;m not sure I would even suggest it to them. My assumption is that as<br/>\nthey want to do more things that cost money, they will want to make money.<br/>\nOr if there is a place where they are inclined to work because of their<br/>\nskills or desires, they will pursue that. I would certainly help them with<br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thought I have is that maybe not every teenager is ready for that<br/>\nresponsibility. My 16 yo son, who is autistic/Asperger&#39;s, and has had 3<br/>\nopen-heart surgeries (the last one happened last year and didn&#39;t go well,<br/>\nsome long-term neurological effects) is ready for some responsibility this<br/>\nway, but I am definitely letting him call the shots. He recently said that<br/>\nhe wanted to work at the local multiplex theatre (film-making is his<br/>\npassion) and I took him there, he filled out the application in his unique<br/>\nway, and I even called the administration office to let them know a little<br/>\nabout his history. They were very enthusiastic about his application. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know if he can really fulfill the responsibilities, but we&#39;ll find<br/>\nout!<br/>\n<br/>\nI do understand and believe that teenagers who feel needed and responsible<br/>\nhave a feeling of connectedness to their importance in the world. We have<br/>\nfound ways to do that at home (art, music-making, home care, whatever their<br/>\ninterests) and in the neighborhood (babysitting, animal care) and I can see<br/>\nhow these activities have made them feel important during this  time. Maybe<br/>\nthis is the feeling you are referring to that you&#39;ve seen with your<br/>\nteenagers have started working out of the home.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe description &quot;a job with real responsibility. Someplace<br/>\nthey&#39;re valued for something they can do, that not everyone can do. A place<br/>\nthey<br/>\ncan build mutually dependent relationships with adults outside their<br/>\nfamily -<br/>\nwhere someone is counting on them to be there and do a good job. A job where<br/>\nthey&#39;re just one more warm body out of many probably isn&#39;t going to be as<br/>\nvaluable.&quot; sounds ideal! I hope we all find that!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the thought-provoking!<br/>\n<br/>\nJacki<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DACunefare@...\">DACunefare@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DACunefare@...\">DACunefare@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, March 17, 2005 9:29 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: The oddities of unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\nMy one best piece of advice for helping everyone get through puberty with<br/>\nsanity and relationship in good shape is to do everything in your power to<br/>\nhelp<br/>\nyour adolescent get a job.

Of our kids, Kirby  and <br/>\nHolly are more like my family and Marty is a LOT like his dad in tons of  ways.   <br/>\nKirby&#39;s puberty was harsh, added to we had moved recently and  he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nlike change, and he&#39;s the oldest and resented the fun attention the  younger ones <br/>\nwere getting while he was having his metamorphosis into bigger,  hairier, <br/>\nunfamiliar big-guy.   He was hard for anyone to deal with for  a while.  <br/>\n <br/>\nHolly&#39;s a little volatile sometimes, and short tempered.  She&#39;s  13.<br/>\n <br/>\nMarty, at 16, though he has beard hair and height and shoulders and all  <br/>\nthat, has just lately gotten the snappish impatience the others got sooner, and  I <br/>\nfigure it&#39;s because Keith had &quot;it&quot; late (whatever all the hormonal &quot;it&quot;  is).<br/>\n <br/>\nI think it&#39;s a natural instinctive separation from parents, and parents do  <br/>\nbest to give those kids more respect and more choices and more freedom if they  <br/>\ncan manage to do so.  Acknowledge that they&#39;re old enough to reproduce,  <br/>\nmaybe, that in some cultures of the past they would have been marriageable, that  <br/>\nyou&#39;re glad our culture waits until people are older to launch them out into  <br/>\nparenthood and responsibility for a house or job, and you&#39;re glad they&#39;re <br/>\nstill  around.  (If any of that&#39;s no good for your family, fine; at least remember <br/>\n it in your own mind, though.)<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen my then-best-friend was moving to California a dozen years ago, we  <br/>\nfound ourselves really short-tempered and mean with each other.  Little  things he <br/>\ndid seemed hugely personal to me, and vice versa, but we&#39;ve had a  policy <br/>\nalways to talk about things like that and not guess.  We didn&#39;t  know, though, <br/>\nwhy we were so grouchy.   <br/>\n <br/>\nTurns out it&#39;s something that happens with lots of people in such  <br/>\nsituations.  When friends are going to be separated it causes some anxiety  and like <br/>\nscared dogs biting a person who&#39;s trying to help them, they lash out at  the <br/>\nnearest person, not knowing what&#39;s causing their pain.  If they&#39;re mad  at each <br/>\nother, the parting is easier.  One is more glad to go and the other  says &quot;fine, <br/>\ngood riddance.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nI think something like that happens with parents and children, too.   And it <br/>\nhappens when the instincts get the first whif (probably physically, at  some <br/>\nlevel) of the offspring&#39;s impending adulthood, and happens some more when  they <br/>\nfirst start to care more about what someone outside the family things  <br/>\n(mating business) and then when they leave.   But if we can see it as  natural <br/>\nseparation behaviors, it won&#39;t hurt our feelings so much.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI waited until I was in my 30&#39;s to have kids, but more people my age (and  <br/>\nlots of my friends were already &quot;doing it.&quot;  I&#39;ve held the hand of many  people <br/>\nI knew since we were teens who weren&#39;t handling their own teens&#39; reations  <br/>\nwell (nor reacting well to them) and I&#39;m sure that&#39;s also helped me be calmer  <br/>\nwith my own.  I&#39;ve seen the kind of clinging and controlling and insulting  NOT <br/>\nto do.  Ifail sometimes, but I move away from the &quot;oops&quot; spot and try  to give <br/>\nthe kids more peaceful space for their transformation to occur.<br/>\n <br/>\nHolly, especially, did NOT want to grow older.  She LIKED being  young.  She <br/>\nasked me and Keith yesterday why we didn&#39;t treat her like she  was five <br/>\nanymore.  It was a wistful kind of question.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think it lasts about a year, with occasional relapses, and is worse if  the <br/>\nparent resists it.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":10649172,"authorName":"Julie","from":"&quot;Julie&quot; &lt;xtr581602@...&gt;","profile":"snoozem404","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: The oddities of unschooling","postDate":"1111029780","msgId":21890,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQxYXQ2aysyYW5oQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHSUVHUERCQUEuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":21886,"nextInTopic":21891,"prevInTime":21889,"nextInTime":21891,"topicId":21878,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everyone, I haven t posted here for ages but I just wanted to say thenks Jacky for: My 13 yo daughter seems to roll her eyes at just about everything I say.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1947570897\">Hi everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t posted here for ages but I just wanted to say thenks Jacky <br/>\nfor:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 13 yo daughter seems to roll her eyes at just about everything I <br/>\nsay.<br/>\nI&#39;ve learned to keep it short and light, but sometimes I just want to<br/>\nscream, &quot;I SAY THESE THINGS BECAUSE THEY ARE IMPORTANT AND I LOVE <br/>\nYOU AND I<br/>\nWANT YOU TO HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NEED IN LIFE TO BE HAPPY AND SAFE <br/>\nAND I WANT<br/>\nYOU TO LISTEN!!!&quot; but I don&#39;t, at least not in that moment. <br/>\nBreathing deep<br/>\nand saying something like &quot;it&#39;s just on my job description to tell <br/>\nyou of<br/>\nthese things&quot; or &quot;did I say that again???

After all, everything else she&#39;s ever done in the <br/>\nworld has been pretty darn fascinating to you, right? Why would she not <br/>\nthink this is interest to you, too? And - remember - she doesn&#39;t have <br/>\nthe sense we have of growing older and more forgetful and our concerns <br/>\nabout repeating ourselves and being boring old coots.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad was sick and had to swallow a LOT of pills. He was in the <br/>\nhospital and the nurse was giving him one pill after another. I said, <br/>\n&quot;Did you know I could swallow all of those at one time? I&#39;m amazingly <br/>\ngood at swallowing large numbers of pills at once.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe NURSE jumped all over me. &quot;He&#39;s doing just fine,&quot; etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nHEY - I wasn&#39;t dissin&#39; my dad --- I just thought it was something he&#39;d <br/>\nbe interested in, that I had that specific talent that he probably <br/>\ndidn&#39;t even know about me.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the nurse thought it would make him feel old or something - make <br/>\nhim feel worse. She was probably right - I was young and didn&#39;t have <br/>\nany sense of fear of old age or death and so I didn&#39;t have enough <br/>\nempathy to know that this was probably NOT something he needed to know <br/>\nabout me right at that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking Holly is the same way - it never occurs to her that you <br/>\nactually feel dissed by her comment that you&#39;ve told her something <br/>\nbefore - it is just information - just a tiny bit interesting - from <br/>\nher point of view?<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, she might be just a little irritated by you repeating <br/>\nyourself - it means you&#39;re human and sometimes kids (especially her <br/>\nage) don&#39;t really feel comfortable being reminded that their parents <br/>\nare subject to the problems of aging.
