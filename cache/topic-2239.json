I never thought about it too much, as the real problem understanding him is when he gets so excited and talks so fast I can&#39;t understand him. Thinking back, I know he had other missing sounds earlier, but I never thought about it too much. I guess that&#39;s one advantage of not having a helpful professional in our family. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe started reading at somewhere after 9, I think, when he wanted to do things on the computer. Now he reads voraciously, is always going to the library and reminding me to buy him more novels, and he reads a lot on the web. He loves Brian Jacques, C.S. Lewis, Edward Eager, Harry Potter, and also Tom Clancy, Dale Brown, others I can&#39;t think of right now, but anything with **planes**. One daughter is 10, has been reading fluently for a few months, and very pleased with being &quot;self-taught.&quot; Her main impetus for reading was that she wanted to read her dollhouse miniatures catalogs so she could write up wish lists.

He is my third <br/>\nborn, and definatley the sweetest natured of all my children. <br/>\nWhen I had him in a kindergarden class I was told <br/>\nto expect the school district would most likely ask to have him put <br/>\non Ridilin(sp?).  No way would I do that to him.  This child plays <br/>\nchess, with any willing victim, and loves loves numbers, puzzles, <br/>\nwood working, and books on tape.  I know if he where in PS they <br/>\nwould lable him learning disabled and have him in special ed.  He is <br/>\nnot and does not need it.  He just needs time.  My problem is in <br/>\nexplaining this to a family that is very education (in the <br/>\ntraditional sense) oriented.  I know they are concerend out of love, <br/>\nbut really what are my options here? <br/>\nPut him in school to have his personality ruined?  And most likley <br/>\nfrustrated w/ reading to the point that he might not even enjoy a <br/>\ngood story.???Sigh......Besided when he is 25 will anyone at all <br/>\nsuspect( or even care) that he was a &quot;late reader&quot;?  <br/>\n<br/>\n....Just venting......<br/>\n Thanks for listening.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am going to try and scan a new picture in w/our garden.
