It even has the chemical <br/>\nbreakdown I posted.<br/>\nAnd here is the link:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lifebalm.com/cayenne_herb.html\">http://www.lifebalm.com/cayenne_herb.html</a><br/>\nand a tidbit of info:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCayenne pepper is the name for the hottest form of Capsicum, which can take <br/>\nother forms. If its heat is 1 BTU, this mild Capsicum is called paprika; if <br/>\nit is from one to twenty-five BTU, it is called simply red pepper; but over <br/>\ntwenty-five BTU rating is termed Cayenne. Therefore Cayenne is the strongest <br/>\nof the Capsicum family. In Mexico alone, many varieties (some claim fifteen <br/>\nor more) of peppers are grown, each with a distinctive flavor, and often very <br/>\nhot indeed. Other important varieties are grown in Japan (predominantly used, <br/>\ndried, in cooking), the United States, and Africa, the latter being valued as <br/>\na high-quality medicinal Cayenne. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the United States varieties, imported from the Mexican state of <br/>\nTabasco, has attained great renown. An American soldier, returning from the <br/>\nMexican War of 1846-48, brought some pepper seeds to Edward Mcllhenny, a <br/>\nbanker, who grew plants from them in Louisiana. McIlhenny found that the <br/>\npeppers made a delightfully piquant sauce. During the Civil War, he left <br/>\nLouisiana, but when he returned, finding his plants still flourishing, was <br/>\npersuaded to market his sauce. Since the war had left him without an income, <br/>\nhe thought this was worth a try, and the venture proved successful; Tabasco <br/>\nSauce is a gourmet treat throughout the world (Heiser: 12).</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9305,"nextTopicId":9309}}
