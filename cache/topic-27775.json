She&#39;s  <br/>\nBIG into taking care of herself, and keeps on (and on) reminding us.   <br/>\nSo I don&#39;t feel the urge to help her, because she assures people she  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t need any help.  But then there&#39;s no basis for the  <br/>\nrelationship after a while.  We have no ebb and flow, no favors done,  <br/>\nno minor indebtednesses.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s harsher with her kids than I am with mine, and assures herself,  <br/>\naloud, that it&#39;s for their own good.<br/>\nThey&#39;re not as open and honest with her as mine are with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the most surprising things to me about having teens is how  <br/>\ngentle and sweet they can be, how concerned about my feelings and  <br/>\npreferences.  I didn&#39;t expect it, but looking back over the way they  <br/>\nwere treated when they were younger and needier of approval and  <br/>\nfreedom and sympathy, I see it come flooding back out of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; be as slow and patient with them as I tried to be  <br/>\n(and I failed sometimes, certainly, losing my temper and being too  <br/>\ntired to turn and give them a big dose of attention now and then).  I  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; and nobody made me, and most of my friends and  <br/>\nrelatives would&#39;ve applauded me had I gone a more traditional route  <br/>\n(because it would have made them feel more comfortable about their  <br/>\nown choices).   It was a choice, but once I knew what kind of  <br/>\nhomelife and relationship I wanted with them, it was an easy choice.   <br/>\nIt became a need, to maintain the environment that had grown from all  <br/>\nour earlier choices and actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould I &quot;choose&quot; now to move toward a harsher and less generous  <br/>\nstance?  Could I say, now, &quot;You&#39;re responsible for your own  <br/>\nhappiness&quot;?  There is an up side to that, and they all do know ways  <br/>\nto be more at peace and to view the world from a more positive  <br/>\nposition.  But there&#39;s a mean cutting off of people sometimes when  <br/>\nsomeone says &quot;I&#39;m not responsible for... &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Responsible&quot; means answerable.
