From the time I had teeth according<br/>\nto family legend.  I bite them to the point where they are unbitable.  They<br/>\noften bleed and get very tender.  I&#39;ve also found that reading is REALLY bad<br/>\non my nails.  I tend to bite more when I&#39;m reading a book, I guess it&#39;s just<br/>\nsomething to do with my hands.

But recently in the last year my granmother was up<br/>\nvisiting and I was biting my nails in front of her.  She gave me a dirty<br/>\nlook and batted my hand away and told me to stop.  I was shocked as no one<br/>\nhad done that in years.  I told her I was a grown adult and they were my<br/>\nnails and I would bite them if I wanted.  And walked away.  It was very<br/>\nfreeing!

I don&#39;t<br/>\nremember what he had promised but it was something great I guess and I did<br/>\nstop biting for a month.  It was then that I realized I couldn&#39;t stop biting<br/>\nbecause nails drive me nuts!!  I felt like I was wearing spiked gloves on my<br/>\nfingers.  I had no sensation on my fingertips (which I was VERY used to<br/>\nhaving) and I kept stabbing myself in the eye or the nose.

The last time I wore makeup was my wedding<br/>\nand I only did it then because at the last minute someone looked at me and<br/>\nsaid I needed it.  So everyone else pitched in and made me up.  I can&#39;t wear<br/>\nnail polish because a) the fumes will kill me! and b) it makes my hands feel<br/>\nlike they are being smothered.    DD4yo used to bite her nails.

My 5 yr old dd bites hers down so low I swear they&#39;re <br/>\nabout to bleed.  I try hard to not say anything because I used to bite <br/>\nmine and nothing my mom said would get me to stop.  I try to tell myself <br/>\nthat in the grand scope of things it doesn&#39;t matter.  I just hope she <br/>\nnot doing it because of stress.  Has Holly bit at hers for long?<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidiC.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;In a message dated 4/16/03 7:50:02 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ynxn96@...\">ynxn96@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; Kelli, me...how many other naked-faced <br/>\n&gt;women are out there?  It&#39;s just shocking!  HeidiC.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My husband never liked make-up, which probably is one reason he liked me.   <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have owned some and used some (eye stuff mostly) but it always felt like <br/>\n&gt;there was gunk on me that needed to be taken off.  I couldn&#39;t justify the <br/>\n&gt;time spent, either.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have had female friends whose own families hadn&#39;t seen them without makeup. <br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t imagine an unschooling family in which that could even BEGIN to work.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sunday Holly found a stash of nail polish she had misplaced and we were going <br/>\n&gt;through admiring the colors.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Holly is trying to stop biting her nails.  She quit for a week.  Then bit, <br/>\n&gt;but a whole week!  And she saw how much they grew in a week.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My nails grow fast and they&#39;re strong.  I can use them for pry bars and screw <br/>\n&gt;drivers.  It really irritates my friends who buy nail-jobs.  Especially since <br/>\n&gt;I frequently cut the left hand short to play guitar (and keep the right long <br/>\n&gt;for fingerpicking, or screw-driving.   <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Lately I&#39;ve been playing fiddle with Holly.  Again, left hand gets cut short.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So I painted my nails glittery gold with a clear overcoat.   At night, it <br/>\n&gt;woke me up once.  The smell or the rough texture or something.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But on Monday, an adult friend of Holly&#39;s was coming over, someone pretty <br/>\n&gt;pink (figuratively speaking) and Holly thought it would be cool for me to <br/>\n&gt;have nail polish, kind of in honor of her much more feminine friend who wears <br/>\n&gt;make-up.  And, Holly says, she wears three layers of pink nail polish.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;AHA!  The friend probably dressed down just for us.  She had makeup, but just <br/>\n&gt;a plain kind of sweatshirt, and I noticed (but Holly did not notice) she was <br/>\n&gt;wearing NO fingernail polish. &lt;g&gt;  So we played card games and I myself had <br/>\n&gt;gloriously long and gold-glittery fingernails.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Just thought that image might amuse those who&#39;ve met me. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
