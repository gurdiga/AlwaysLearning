When she was born, my former employer gave her a beautifully soft blanket from India. It very quickly became her favorite thing (understandably so!). It wasn&#39;t long before she wanted to take it everywhere with her. The problem was is that it was big! I cut it into 4 pieces and finished the cut sides and presto, she had 4 blankets! She was delighted (she was about 9 months old at this point)! She could now, easily, take any one of the blankets with us anywhere we went. Her favorite part of the blankets were the corners, so gradually she would &#39;love on it&#39; enough that the edge strip would come off and she would carry that around (that&#39;s how &#39;corner&#39; got it&#39;s name). We had a couple of traumatic times when one got left on the bus and another time when she &#39;lost&#39; one in her bedroom (we never did find it, even when we moved). Luckily we had backups. I still have a &#39;corner&#39; in my jewelery box and she has one in her<br/>\n &#39;special stuff&#39; box. I also made her a doll out of the body of one of the blankets that she keeps on her bed. I can&#39;t imagine taking that away from her! <br/>\nI&#39;m also careful about what she says she&#39;s ready to get rid of. If it&#39;s something that&#39;s one of a kind or something that&#39;s been really special to her, I stash it in the garage, just in case. My mom asked me if we could sell my doll house (it was handmade by her) when I was 13. I said sure, I don&#39;t play with it anymore. I still regret that decision! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMeghan<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nToo much rigidity on the part of teachers should be followed by a brisk spirit of insubordination on the part of the taught.<br/>\n~ Agnes Repplier<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":121479904,"authorName":"Robin","from":"&quot;Robin &quot; &lt;kyra40@...&gt;","profile":"seawind36","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Tossing a Child&#39;s Belongings was Re: Natural Child Article","postDate":"1216698347","msgId":36766,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwM2UwMWM4ZWJhZCQ2ZGZkNWU1MCQwNDAxYThjMEBST0JJTj4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDY1QzY4OUQwLTg4QjctNDM0Qy05N0JDLTkwMDY5RUM4NDZDOEBtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":36763,"nextInTopic":36784,"prevInTime":36765,"nextInTime":36767,"topicId":36705,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I had a soft bodied doll and a stuffed raccoon - Miss Peep and Coon Coon.

It&#39;s fun to see her babies wrapped up in my blanky.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother in law remade a quilt that had belonged to her youngest son. <br/>\nIt was his blanky and he had almost worn it out, but it was a nice baby<br/>\nquilt and really well made, so she fixed it and patched it and put new<br/>\nthings on it without drastically changing it.  Now he can see his kids<br/>\nusing it.  My husband wasn&#39;t so lucky with stuff like that because he<br/>\nwas the oldest and all his stuff either got handed down or thrown out. <br/>\nHe had kept a small bag of stuffed animals, but mice got to them, and<br/>\nthis was when I first met him before we had kids, and they had to be<br/>\ntossed.

Otherwise I&#39;d not<br/>\nbe over anything.  I might say (to myself not others) that&#39;s just the way<br/>\nsomeone is (whoever does this kind of crap).  I might be able to think of<br/>\ntheir as an affliction.  Because throwing away other people&#39;s things or not<br/>\nrespecting other&#39;s privacy really is a kind of affliction.  And if they do<br/>\nit to some and not others, then it&#39;s a problem in all the relationships that<br/>\nthey behave that way in.  Boundaries being marched right over.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my folks, it was said that a child could earn respect but in reality<br/>\nthat so seldom happened that it might just as well have not been a<br/>\npossibility at all, and I remember all too well that as a child I didn&#39;t<br/>\nthink of earning respect as a real possibility.  Instead, private letters<br/>\nweren&#39;t private and neither was one&#39;s room.  Everything under a parent&#39;s<br/>\nroof was just theirs to do with as they pleased and a child&#39;s stuff was not<br/>\ntheir own.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarrot/stick approach to child behavior modification on top of that is mean<br/>\n+ manipulative.
