Activities groups sometimes cause stress and  <br/>\ndisagreements.  DO the kids have to stand in line quietly, or can they  <br/>\nplay until they&#39;re called?  At a pizza-place kitchen tour, when they  <br/>\ngive the kids a free pizza, can one parent buy soda without the other  <br/>\nparents glaring?
