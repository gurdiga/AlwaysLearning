There&#39;s also a door to the backyard so it served as a<br/>\nroute to more fun outside. The main problem though is the garage is only<br/>\nsemi-insulated, and there&#39;s only one smallish window on the side, close to a<br/>\nfence,  so in the winter it&#39;s too cold and dark in there.

Plus messes that stain don&#39;t really matter because if they ever decide to sell they can just either paint over the stains or some such.  The roof is pitched high like the rest of the house,  they put in a normal door leading off the bedroom - buyers would see this as a wonderful, huge, easily accessible attic storage space OR a wonderful kids play area.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister has &quot;finished&quot; their basement with an area rug / carpet remnant, painted the walls, added decor to liven it up and comfy old furniture as a play area.  There is a TV down there - as well as upstairs.  Laundry is down there and storage too.  She made sure it was enticing to kids AND adults so, adults would want to hang out with the kids.  This is not your typical finished basement in real-estate terms - just fixed it so it is appealing to the members of the household.  They have a very tiny house with 5 people so this was a good / cheap option for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing we did that we&#39;ve been grateful for (We built the house and then a month after we moved in I realized I was pregnant.  We&#39;d been married for 10 years and didn&#39;t think that was going to happen after all those years.)  was hard wood floors on the middle level - you can go in the front door straight through to the back door and just clean up the wet, muddy mess without worrying about carpet.  I wanted hardwood through out the house but hubby did not - so I insisted on the middle level - boy are we glad we did. <br/>\n<br/>\n Also our house is built into the side of a hill - so the basement is half garage and half basement - but you can just walk straight into the basement off the garage without going through the house - it has been a wonderful place - we put in a bathtub we found at the home center on clearance because it was scratched.  We elevated it on a wooden frame work - great for bathing dogs was our original intent but it has seen other wornderful uses too.  We also put in a toilet in the basement so people can run in from outside filthy dirty/wet/ etc and not have to worry about tracking on the carpet to get to the bathrooms upstairs.  The toilet and tub are not walled off they are just tucked into the far back corner of the basement for handy use.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a piece of plywood on saw horses in the basement for a while - that was used as a huge &quot;table&quot;  Now we have a ton of shelving - the metal heavy duty stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe lined the garage walls with shelves up high for storage - above auto roof line as the garage has a high ceiling.  Then we also built a loft for storage in the garage too.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the regular part of the house, I reasearched how to make a small house feel big, and we went with high vaulted ceilings (meaning no attic space) and lots of windows - lots of light colors.  We also took out walls where we could.  For example we removed the wall between the kitchen and family room so as you sit at the kitchen table you can watch TV or interact with whom ever is in the family room.  There is a rail because the family room is down half a story - on the same level as the garage.  All in all the house is very open and one does not ever feel shut off from others unless you go to a bedroom or the basement and shut the door.  People cannot believe how few square footage we really have - they think it is more because it is so open.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also made sure there were huge walk in closets off two bedrooms.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe laundry we moved from the basement to the upstairs - next to the bedrooms.  This was a linen closet area in the plans anyway so we made it into a laundry closet.  People said not to do this in case the washer leaked - so we shut off the water supply if we leave for a few days which is much easier than carrying loads of laundry to the basement and back up.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_,_._,___ <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Magazine houses and remodeling, was relatives, changes, and why we can unschool","postDate":"1208613183","msgId":34391,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ1MjE4NTdCLTgzOEUtNDdCRi05NTI4LTQ0MjgyOTA5MkVBNEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDdENkUwNjU5LTYwOTEtNDJFOC04NEIzLUQwOTIwOTRCQUQ1M0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDgwNDE4MDcwNC5tM0k3NHBlUzA4NDgwNUBzaGVsbC5sbWkubmV0PiA8MDJCRjQxREUtNDY2OS00QURGLTgyQjktNURBRUUxQTZBNEM0QHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8OWY3MmQ3NjIwODA0MTkwMDIxaTE4NGY3ZDMydmIwNmIwYTMyYzllZDdiZTNAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+IDw3RDZFMDY1OS02MDkxLTQyRTgtODRCMy1EMDkyMDk0QkFENTNAc2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":34390,"nextInTopic":34392,"prevInTime":34390,"nextInTime":34392,"topicId":34360,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Our<br/>\nhouse is a lot bigger than our last house and that makes a big difference.<br/>\nSome things could be smaller or deleted and we would be fine, but we love<br/>\nthe size or our great room and we wouldn&#39;t change that.  If we could have<br/>\nonly changed one thing about our last house, that definitely would have been<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main thing we wanted was a big great room (living/dining/kitchen all<br/>\nconnected - not sure if it is a regional term or not).  It is nice to have a<br/>\nbig kitchen with room for the kids to join me without feeling crowded.  The<br/>\nmost important part was the living room, though.  We wanted a lot of room<br/>\nfor the kids to play and run around because we spent all our time in that<br/>\nroom in our old house, but it was small.  We still spend most of our time<br/>\nthere, but now there is plenty or room to run, climb and play.  The couches<br/>\nare much better climbing toys now that they are in the middle of the room<br/>\ninstead of against the walls - much better for jumping off the top.  It&#39;s<br/>\ngreat.  There is also enough room that we set up a permanently available art<br/>\ntable for the kids.  It has messy things that I wouldn&#39;t want over the<br/>\ncarpet but we have enough room in the kitchen table area for an extra table.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a lot of built in bookshelves and cupboards throughout the house and<br/>\nthat is great because we really want all the books, games and toys to be<br/>\naccessible.  Another thing is that the built in shelves are much stronger<br/>\nand more stable.  We have some by the fireplace that are cabinets on the<br/>\nbottom and bookshelves above that.  The kids can climb up to reach things on<br/>\nhigher shelves and it is safe.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdjoining the great room, we have a normal sized room with a wall of<br/>\nbookshelves and some comfy chairs.  I thought that it would be nice when<br/>\nsomeone wanted to be near the rest of the family, but wanted some quiet to<br/>\nread a book or work on something by themselves.  Right now that isn&#39;t what<br/>\nthe kids want, but I thought that it would be particularly nice to have a<br/>\nroom like that when homeschooling.  I could be deluding myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like having a big enough master bedroom to have lots of room for everyone<br/>\nto sleep in here.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have some covered areas outside (porch/patio) so that we can hang out<br/>\noutside even when it is raining.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the only thing that we really should have done is have a better<br/>\nspace indoors for messes.
