However, he has  <br/>\nan additional three weeks in which to make said money. He also  <br/>\nrealized that mom wanted his old one, and was willing to pay cash to  <br/>\nbuy it for the girls to have, and also that he could finagle an  <br/>\nadditional 10% out of me to guarantee not to sell it at game xchange.  <br/>\nSmart, huh?
