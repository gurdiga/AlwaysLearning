The<br/>\nyoungest older DS hasn&#39;t decided on anything for the<br/>\nrest of his life yet (except music).

My boys had, and still have, those  same<br/>\nexperiences....with girls and women. The phone#, etc.<br/>\nAs do  the sons of some of the other parents, here. Or<br/>\nmaybe it just a dearth of niceness in general? <br/>\n<br/>\nDo teen girls and young women have similar<br/>\nexperiences?
