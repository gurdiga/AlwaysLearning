Throw in scoops, toy cars, bowls, empty cans, paper towel tubes, etc. and you&#39;ve got hours of fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe also do the same concept but with water. I just fill a big tupperware with warm water (sometimes soapy) and throw out a bunch of big bowls or pots and cups and funnels and egg beaters. Playmobil people get brought in and bath toys and boats and all manner of things.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey key for me to make all of this easy is painter&#39;s plastic and beach towels. You can buy a roll of thin painter&#39;s dropcloth plastic at the hardware store for a few bucks, then just cut off a huge sqare and lay it on the kitchen floor. Throw down some beach towels or an old blanket or sheet and the mess is really contained. (Careful walking on it, though, it can be slippery!). <br/>\n<br/>\nMessy parties are also fun (and again, with the painters plastic, I just wad up the whole thing at the end and throw it all in the garbage). Make a few piles of flour, shaving cream, cooked pasta (leftovers work great!), food coloring, pudding...whatever. I fill a dishpan with warm soapy water and have a bunch of dishtowels on hand, too, for washing up. Makes it so much easier!<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps!<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy<br/>\nSam (10) & Eli (6)<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":472480490,"authorName":"sheeboo2","from":"&quot;sheeboo2&quot; &lt;brmino@...&gt;","profile":"sheeboo2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Ideas for late pregnancy, little kids, and cold weather","postDate":"1325256982","msgId":64672,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpka2plbStuZmdwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDU2MTE5MzdELTc1NDAtNDgxNS04NDRGLUJBRTQ4MDJEMURCM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":64670,"nextInTopic":64676,"prevInTime":64671,"nextInTime":64673,"topicId":64645,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Just a warning... we&#39;re renters and it turned out that taking the tape up also pulled up some surface of the wood floor.  I thought masking tape wouldn&#39;t damage the floors.  Luckily, they are old floors in bad shape, so the landlord won&#39;t care.

I made a second wizard hat as the kit only comes with one.  My 5.5 year old LOVES TV but this kit has her enthralled.  There are plenty of materials to do the spells (experiments) over and over again.  The test tubes alone are going to be hours of fun even after the kit materials are all used.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also got a Smithsonian kit from Michaels on sale that simulates a dig for jewels.  The jewels are small, but my 5.5 year old LOVED this one, too.  We had extra goggles from a kids toolkit set so my 2.7 year old enjoyed discovering alongside her big sis.  I believe this one was under $10, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Smithsonian-Rock-and-Gem-Dig/product-reviews/B00200JX3I\">http://www.amazon.com/Smithsonian-Rock-and-Gem-Dig/product-reviews/B00200JX3I</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThis season, I&#39;ve made handrolled candles from sheets of beeswax with my girls.  They added ribbons to make them extra festive as well as just played with the beeswax.  We ate honeycomb alongside it for an extrasensory experience!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been saving empty toilet paper rolls and having a TON of them has made for interesting inventions by my girls -- instruments, fishing poles, binoculars, bowling pins, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI splurged at Michaels and bought a $4 hot glue gun (not for the kids to use) but I also got a 1 LB. bag of acrylic &quot;gems&quot; and my girls were entranced by their beauty and wanting to decorate their Xmas stockings with them. They laid them out and I glued them on.  I was wondering if they were going to want to bejewel their clothing -- not yet!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been beading jewelry necklaces and bracelets (make sure the beads are easy enough to thread -- my 2.7 needs bigger beads and bead holes than my 5.5 year old).<br/>\n<br/>\nI also gave the girls wool felt pieces and yarn needles (big, dull needles) to sew their own pointy hats for their dolls.  We made pom pom tops for the hats, too.  My 2.7 didn&#39;t really sew on her own, but she enjoyed pulling the needle once I had pushed it into the fabric.  My 5.5 year old sewed a good amount of her own hat.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my 5 year old was 2.7 and I was pregnant (in chilly wintry London) and directed to rest as much as possible, we baked sugar cookies, made all kinds of shapes and decorated with icing (from little squeeze tubes) and sprinkles.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe made short books (4 or 6 pages) where I drew the images and my 2.7 year old painted them.  Some were short rhymes from a book we were reading and others we made up.  It&#39;s really nice to have these as a memory of the time!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; --- And any ideas on what to do about toddlers and winter gear and stairs.

I would bring it with me and let her experience the cold and then suggest we either head home or she put the coat on.  She was running around so much at the playground that she was surprisingly relatively warm.  We also had bought expensive thermal underwear from Patagonia and layered it with regular clothing, a sweater and a fleece jacket.  My second daughter uses the flannel as PJs and they are still in almost new condition!  Having the right mittens (or gloves), a scarf and hat were key.  Having warm tea or soup to bring in a thermos also helps.  For us, making an adventure of the day -- planning on visiting a favorite toy store got us out the door which then could lead us to the park.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had snow and bulky clothes to contend with now, I&#39;d probably talk about going to the moon, moonboots, spacesuits and needing protection (my kids pretend they are astronauts often).

We play ball games such as throwing little basketballs in a hoop, bowling and playing baseball with a balloon. We like making and doing obstacle courses. We often have dance afternoons with different themes, our personal favourite being bhangra/bollywood dance music where we get all dressed up and jeweled up. Other favourites are Abba, Barbie and superhero dance afternoons, with appropriate costumes and accessories. We sing a lot too (while dancing or not), and I think the children would love a karaoke machine, but we don&#39;t have one yet. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe children like to pretend to be Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson and I plant clues for them to solve a mystery. Or they plant clues or do something secretive and I have to figure out what it is. We like to make complicated marble runs with objects we have in the house and hang little bells and try to have the marbles ring the bell. We have a big kapla set that we sometimes build with and we also love trying to make contraptions with the kapla - this is an example: www.mindwarewholesale.com/Solutions/PDF/44156W.pdf<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a two year old though, this might be difficult. When my daughter was younger, I used to sit in the middle and help the children each make their own buildings and simple contraptions. Otherwise it didn&#39;t work.

Sometimes I give them little assignments, such as take a picture of something that makes you happy, something green, something old, something that starts with the letter B, something stinky. They *love* making movies of themselves on photo booth on our mac computer. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was low on energy and late in my pregnancy, my favourite thing to do was to take long baths with my toddler. I would bring books and toys and stay as long as we could. Then I&#39;d make a comfy nest on the sofa with popcorn and a mixed plate of food and we&#39;d watch movies and t.v. while we cuddled. And then I&#39;d repeat the whole thing (hopefully with a nap in between) until my husband came home and did more active stuff with our son. <br/>\n<br/>\nRippy<br/>\nGianluca 7, Gisele 5</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Ideas for late pregnancy, little kids, and cold weather","postDate":"1325101245","msgId":64648,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMjUxMDEyNDUuNzIyNjIuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyMjUwOS5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGpkZm1rMCtqNzFtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpkZm1rMCtqNzFtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64646,"nextInTopic":64649,"prevInTime":64647,"nextInTime":64649,"topicId":64645,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"*** If there isn t snow, perhaps I can get him some warm long underwear and skip the snowpants.

He really hates the snowpants.***<br/>\n<br/>\nSnow or no snow, my kids have preferred wearing layers over winter gear.  They would rather get wet and change into dry things.  I remember being that way too!  The best winter item I ever got was a snug fitting thermal that repelled water, like wool, but it wasn&#39;t wool.  I got it when I was 15 and I still have it and it still works great.  I paid a LOT of money for it at the time, but given that I&#39;ve had it for over 20 yrs, I think it was worth it!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can find wool leggings for kids, that seems ideal.  But really, a pair of thermals under sweat pants seems to work for a couple of hrs before they get too cold from being wet.  You can pack a set for changing into.  Snow pants are bulky and uncomfortable!  I&#39;ve also used garbage bags as clothing under sweat pants.  It&#39;s weird but it works.  I learned that trick from Girl Scout survival training.<br/>\n<br/>\n***So, I would love more ideas for stuff to do at home. I think my 5.5 year old daughter would really like some more &#39;guided&#39; crafts to do, along with all the loose art we do.***<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she likes that sort of thing, why not just add something cool into the mix, like giant chenille craft sticks, or puff balls and googly eyes, or left over wrapping paper, or something more open ended like play dough, you can even make your own. <br/>\n<br/>\n***Even so, it seems like the two of them (2.5 and 5.5 years old) turn to the games on the internet, or TV shows, for much of the day. Its great, and I watch with them. But I feel that sometimes its out of boredom, because I&#39;ve run out of everything I can think of to make things sparkly.***<br/>\n<br/>\nDo the kids seem happy and getting along?  If so, I&#39;d leave it be.  You don&#39;t need to make everyday exceptional.  Some days can be average.  Bring interesting things in to add to average days.  It&#39;s that little bit of exceptional that can spark interest and excitement.  To do it everyday sounds exhausting!  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have rarely watched TV as a solo activity.  What do they do while watching?  Do they play with toys or build things, or move around?  Maybe think about adding to those things.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Ideas for late pregnancy, little kids, and cold weather","postDate":"1325096868","msgId":64646,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgyRkYzODJGLUZEM0ItNDRDMy1BRjI5LUJFMURBRjExRUE4OEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpkZm1rMCtqNzFtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpkZm1rMCtqNzFtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64645,"nextInTopic":64648,"prevInTime":64645,"nextInTime":64647,"topicId":64645,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-So, I m imagining that the next two months or so are going to be spent more indoors - and I d love some more ideas for what to do.

Usually we really enjoy getting out a lot, so this is a challenging time for me.  I&#39;m finding I just don&#39;t have the strength to carry him with all of our winter gear on and those flights of stairs. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;m imagining that the next two months or so are going to be spent more indoors - and I&#39;d love some more ideas for what to do.  We already watch lots of kids shows, and play games online.  I have arts and crafts supplies - and we paint and color and glue and cut.  Taking baths with toys helps the day flow too.  We bake, read books, sew a bit.  We&#39;re working on getting some new toys to liven things up as well - a trip to Value Village soon.  Even so, it seems like the two of them (2.5 and 5.5 years old) turn to the games on the internet, or TV shows, for much of the day.  Its great, and I watch with them.  But I feel that sometimes its out of boredom, because I&#39;ve run out of everything I can think of to make things sparkly.  I&#39;d like to choose from fun and fun, not things they are already bored of.  We seem to be getting one cold after another as well, which makes having friends over more difficult. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I would love more ideas for stuff to do at home.  I think my 5.5 year old daughter would really like some more &#39;guided&#39; crafts to do, along with all the loose art we do.  And any ideas on what to do about toddlers and winter gear and stairs.  If there isn&#39;t snow, perhaps I can get him some warm long underwear and skip the snowpants.  He really hates the snowpants.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nShira</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64704,"nextTopicId":64729}}
