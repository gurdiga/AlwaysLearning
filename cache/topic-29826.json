You notice the animals don&#39;t bark  because <br/>\nthey&#39;re not allowed to. Literally, when they hear [a whistle], they immediately hold their <br/>\nbreath. Because Mother Nature is a good teacher. When you see the alpha male eating <br/>\nfirst, the other ones stay away because [otherwise] they get killed. Good rules, <br/>\nrepercussions for bad behavior  you&#39;ll get results.  [With pets] you can&#39;t do lovey-<br/>\ndovey and you can&#39;t kind of go, &quot;Oh, they&#39;re so cute,&quot; because they will twist you, they&#39;ll <br/>\nrule you.  And young people, children, are trying to figure out how to survive in this <br/>\nworld, which is why they go and they try stuff, trying to figure out who they are.
