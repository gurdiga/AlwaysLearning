He probably really enjoyed that  <br/>\nsense of being part of the big group of friends, and he wants his  <br/>\nkids to enjoy it too. I have something like that, too, which I  <br/>\nsometimes regret my own kids never got. I remember getting up on  <br/>\nSaturday morning, packing a lunch, and going off on my bike - riding  <br/>\nfor an hour or two all over the place. Then I&#39;d stop in a nice place  <br/>\nand eat my lunch, then ride some more. I liked to ride at the  <br/>\ndifferent schools - elementary, jr. high, and high school, as well as  <br/>\nin the open dirt fields. Sometimes another kid and I would hook up  <br/>\nand ride together a while, or get started playing something together,  <br/>\nbut a lot of the time it was just me, by myself. I LOVED the freedom  <br/>\nof it - I appreciated it even then.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is, they aren&#39;t us. Even if they went to school, what was  <br/>\nimportant to us may very likely not be important to them. Given a  <br/>\nlong Saturday with no scheduled activities, none of my kids would  <br/>\nhave chosen to go off, on their own, on a bicycle, just wandering and  <br/>\nplaying pretend games all alone. One of my most treasured memories is  <br/>\njust totally unappealing to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat urge to be part of a big group of friends is interesting. It  <br/>\nmight help your husband to consider that your kids are not needy of  <br/>\nbeing part of a big group to feel accepted. They are more okay with  <br/>\nthemselves than he probably was and probably will be more particular  <br/>\nabout who they spend their time with. And, they&#39;ll be way more likely  <br/>\nto consider their own siblings (and parents) as worthy of hanging out  <br/>\nwith.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Nov 1, 2007, at 8:20 AM, rn9302000 wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; When he said be a &quot;part of it all&quot;, he explained himself.
