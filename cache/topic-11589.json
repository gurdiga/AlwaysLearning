When<br/>\nhe is sick (rarely) it is never for long and hardly<br/>\never serious.  It&#39;s irksome to me, who has always had<br/>\na somewhat compromised immune system and spent much of<br/>\nmy life ill in hospital or convalescing at home. <br/>\nHowever, since leaving my stressful childhood behind,<br/>\neliminating dysfunctional people from my life as much<br/>\nas possible, and getting my allergies under control, I<br/>\nam much, much healthier.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is Tom&#39;s first major injury (injuries) since<br/>\nwe&#39;ve been married, and he is healing with his typical<br/>\nspeed.  I was worried that he would have continuing<br/>\nproblems with the wrist and knee, and have to wear<br/>\nbraces off and on for maybe a long time, but I think<br/>\nwe can possibly make him stronger than before.  We are<br/>\nplanning to start doing Yoga in the mornings for<br/>\nhealth, and hopefully as physical therapy for him as<br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven Tom&#39;s lacerations from all the glass healed so<br/>\nquickly that we had to cut out several pieces of glass<br/>\nthat had healed over.  One on his forehead will leave<br/>\na bigger scar, as it required a trip to the doctor and<br/>\nstitches to remove it.  It&#39;s hard to imagine how you<br/>\ncould miss embedded glass like that, but when you are<br/>\nlooking at a lacerated mess from glass exploding at<br/>\nhim, it&#39;s hard to see anything, and not a place you<br/>\nwant to poke around.  Tom has a number of new scars on<br/>\nhis head and arms, but they are a small price to pay<br/>\nfor his life.  We are very, very lucky.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: question about Tom&#39;s recovery, Nanci--","postDate":"1042485158","msgId":11697,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyYi4yMDA4ODkxZC4yYjU0NjlhNkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":11695,"nextInTopic":11708,"prevInTime":11696,"nextInTime":11698,"topicId":11589,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/13/03 9:36:16 AM, mr_t4of5@yahoo.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1717426455\">In a message dated 1/13/03 9:36:16 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mr_t4of5@...\">mr_t4of5@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; The X-Rays also don&#39;t<br/>\nshow any sign of a chip fracture.

He took X-Rays of both my<br/>\nwrist and knee and tested my knee for strength.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can still see a fracture line on the wrist, but I do not need the<br/>\nbrace anymore.  I still have to be careful about using it and how much I<br/>\nlift with it but it is healing up.  I recently discovered that<br/>\nanti-inflamatory drugs prevent bone regrowth, so I think the Tylonol I was<br/>\ntaking may have slowed the mending of my wrist.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy knee has almost completely healed (two torn ligaments.)  He says that<br/>\nthe healing in my knee is way ahead of schedule.  The X-Rays also don&#39;t<br/>\nshow any sign of a chip fracture.  So, as he put it, either the original<br/>\nX-Rays and ultra sound were flawed or the chip settled back in place and<br/>\nhealed up.  It looks, to his amazement, that I will not require any<br/>\nsurgery on my knee and I should make a near full recovery.    He is not<br/>\nsure that I will regain full mobility with my knee but I have passed the<br/>\n60 degrees of movement that he was hoping to get at a minimum.<br/>\n<br/>\nI go back in a month (from the 7th) for possibly one last visit.  He is<br/>\npretty sure the knee will be beyond what he can do to help it.  He is more<br/>\nconcerned about the wrist at this time.<br/>\n<br/>\nTom Kuykendall<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
