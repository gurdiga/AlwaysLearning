(It would&#39;ve helped me when I was  <br/>\n&gt;little, because I was big into measurements and &quot;fairness.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I like the idea, and I think it will be useful a little more down the road.<br/>\nWe haven&#39;t done anything similar to that for any situation, so I&#39;ll give it<br/>\nsome thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat it stirs for me right now is the idea of &quot;fill his cup&quot;, emotionally<br/>\nand otherwise.  I don&#39;t remember if I originally got the concept from<br/>\nunschooling philosophy, unconditional parenting (Alfie Kohn), TCS, Scott<br/>\nNoelle&#39;s ideas of &quot;attraction parenting&quot;, or somewhere else in the<br/>\nreading/thinking I&#39;ve done, but in most situations where there&#39;s a question<br/>\nof &quot;fairness&quot; or a competition for a resource such as the TV, I try to look<br/>\nfor an underlying need that&#39;s not getting met...for attention or time with<br/>\nme or whatever it might be.  I have chosen to believe that if John&#39;s cup is<br/>\nfull, if his needs/wants are fully met, then we have less drama overall in<br/>\nthe house.  And experimentally/experientially, this seems to be the case.<br/>\nSome days, trying to get everything done, it feels like a high-minded ideal.<br/>\nBut in those times (especially on the weekends) when I can get away from<br/>\ncorporate life and earning money and other adult concerns, and completely<br/>\nconnect with John for uninterrupted hours and hours, life flows magically.<br/>\nOn those days, he&#39;ll *want* to watch motorcycle racing with me on TV,<br/>\ninstead of complaining about it as soon as I turn it on and insisting it&#39;s<br/>\n&quot;his turn&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nDays when we&#39;re connected like that, nothing I say or do or offer to him is<br/>\nchallenged or questioned.  He&#39;s happy-go-lucky.  Life is fun.  Problems are<br/>\nsolved easily and quickly.  Other days, when the attachment/connection is<br/>\nweaker, it feels like all day is one drama after another.  Problems get<br/>\nsolved, but it doesn&#39;t feel like we&#39;re solving the &quot;right&quot; problems.  And<br/>\nattempts to talk and reason through things are met with his high-pitched<br/>\nscream voice to loudly drown out my attempts to calmly offer any of the<br/>\nseveral other options.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if his figurative &quot;cup&quot; were full, I don&#39;t think there would ever be a<br/>\nneed for a physical representation like you described...a way to demonstrate<br/>\nhow much time he got on a resource such as the TV, to somehow convince him<br/>\nthat it&#39;s &quot;enough for now&quot;, and now it&#39;s my turn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI say all this to say that, even though I&#39;d be willing to spend $2000<br/>\noutfitting every room in the house with a home entertainment system to<br/>\nincrease his/our options (all except the master bedroom, where my wife<br/>\nbelieves it would be bad feng shui to have a screen), it doesn&#39;t seem like<br/>\nI&#39;d be solving the &quot;right&quot; problem.  -=b.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBrad in Boulder, CO<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://holcombs.org\">http://holcombs.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: (Video game and TV time) newbie problem....LONG!","postDate":"1228329626","msgId":40775,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENFRUZBODlGLTExNkEtNDExQy1CMTEyLTk3MTRFNTc4MTlCOEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDA1MGIwMWM5NTRkOSQyODhkYWUyMCQwNTAxYThjMEBHb256bz4=","referencesHeader":"PGdoM2FraStucWtvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NTk2MTMyLjgxMzcyLnFtQHdlYjYzNzA2Lm1haWwucmUxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPEJEQUQxN0U1LTczMEYtNDQ1Qy04QUIyLTAyQUE3REFDNDU5OEBtYWMuY29tPiA8OERCOTk1NjQtRjAwMi00OUJBLTg4NTctMkQxOEM2MjcxNUVFQG1hYy5jb20+IDwyMDQxMS45NzA4Ni5xbUB3ZWI2MzcwNC5tYWlsLnJlMS55YWhvby5jb20+IDwwNTBiMDFjOTU0ZDkkMjg4ZGFlMjAkMDUwMWE4YzBAR29uem8+"},"prevInTopic":40774,"nextInTopic":40776,"prevInTime":40774,"nextInTime":40776,"topicId":40729,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I don&#39;t mind a bit  <br/>\ntrying to help my children behave in more socially acceptable ways,  <br/>\nor to see (which they&#39;re good at) that there are better and worse  <br/>\ntimes and places for certain behaviors.  I asked them when they were  <br/>\nlittle not to eat with their mouths open or to bite their forks or to  <br/>\nmake noise when they drink.  It wasn&#39;t a big deal.   It was changing  <br/>\nthem, but they don&#39;t mind assistance to fit in more smoothly and  <br/>\ncomfortably in the world.  I&#39;ve changed a lot over the years I&#39;ve had  <br/>\nkids, too--sometimes from ideas other parents shared with me, and  <br/>\nsometimes from things my kids or my  husband said might be better  <br/>\ndone another way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s an unschooling angle, necessarily, to assume that  <br/>\na child is doing her best in every instance.

That would be ridiculous. Nor have her father or I ever told her <br/>\nshe had that &quot;right&quot; which is nonsensical,  nor modelled persisting in <br/>\nhanging around places we weren&#39;t welcome either. I would say that in her <br/>\nmind she wasn&#39;t &quot;refusing to leave&quot; places; she was just wanting to keep on <br/>\nswimming or playing with her friend, that on a few occasions have become <br/>\nsomewhat embarrassing power struggle - once with me that I can recall, and <br/>\nonce when she was with dh - but I won&#39;t assert that my memory is so <br/>\nfaultless that there may not have been a few more times that I just can&#39;t <br/>\nremember, but these two times loom large.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe often have visitors that don&#39;t want to leave when their parents say so <br/>\ntoo, because they are having a great time. Sometimes it takes a few times <br/>\nsaying &quot;it&#39;s time to go&quot; and other words like &quot;we can come back soon&quot; for <br/>\nthem to leave willingly too. I don&#39;t think they are unschoolers, although <br/>\nthey may be.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso we weren&#39;t saying &quot;If you don&#39;t leave now you will never come back&quot; or <br/>\n&quot;you will go into time out when we get home&quot; or &quot;you just lost tv for today&quot; <br/>\nor &quot;do you want a smack&quot; or any of the stuff that make kids who want to stay <br/>\nat fun, interesting places leave immediately when ordered to (supposedly).<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt; From the time they were nursing babies, they would lie down with us<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; when we went to sleep, or down next to me if I was up writing or<br/>\n&gt; watching a movie.  If we were out and they fell asleep on the way<br/>\n&gt; home, we&#39;d put them in bed.  Bed was always a nice and good thing,<br/>\n&gt; not a &quot;get in and stay in&quot; thing.  Sleep didn&#39;t have directly to do<br/>\n&gt; with bed. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So did Jayn. I&#39;ve written before about when she was younger on numerous <br/>\noccasions. She just went to bed with us and nursed to sleep. She still falls <br/>\nasleep on the sofa about half the time and I &quot;sleep-walk&quot; her into the <br/>\nbedroom. I often think of you or Keith, Sandra, doing the same with your <br/>\nkids, as you have reported.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt; Because we had a good relationship and they liked being able to stay<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; up, they would be quiet or go to bed. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This seems to be implying that Jayn and I don&#39;t have a good relationship, or <br/>\nthat any challenging behavior coming from our children must be because our <br/>\nrelationships with them aren&#39;t sufficient. I would be sad to think that this <br/>\nis what you mean to say.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that Jayn and I do have a good relationship and that many of the <br/>\nchallenges I have, especially in being tired, are because she really does <br/>\nwant even more from me, even more of my attention and time and the fun we <br/>\nhave together. She wants me to play, draw, swim, write down her stories, <br/>\nsew, read to her, make food, watch tv with her, play computer games, walk <br/>\naround our favorite stores, listen to her adventures a lot, lot, lot. About <br/>\na 1000 percent more than I ever wanted my mother in my life at the age of 9. <br/>\nYou know that time versus age graph you made that is a diagonal line? Well <br/>\nour graph looks like a horizontal line most of the time based on her <br/>\ndesires. Plus we laugh our asses off together.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur relationship is my priority.<br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I would&#39;ve said &quot;It&#39;s just not okay.  I have a physical need to <br/>\nsleep, your dad<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; has to go to work, NOBODY would think it&#39;s okay--not the neighbors,<br/>\n&gt; not child welfare, not the police, not a judge.  You can lie down<br/>\n&gt; next to me and be quiet, or you can listen to music with headphones,<br/>\n&gt; or you can watch a movie quietly, but those are  your choices right<br/>\n&gt; now.&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*Of course* I have said very similar things to this. We have had <br/>\nconversations about child welfare and the possibility of other people <br/>\ncalling the police at different times including, I&#39;m sorry to say, in the <br/>\nheat of my anger. She knows that I&#39;m tired if I have gone into bed. She <br/>\nknows that dh has to sleep for work. And if she is in the bedroom poking me, <br/>\nor pushing on dh with her feet and I say any of these things the next moment <br/>\nshe is crying even more loudly and coming up with more choices that involve <br/>\nme getting up, and disturbing dh even more.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one ever told her this behavior was OK, appropriate, or acceptable, or <br/>\none of her choices. On the contrary I would remove her sometimes with a lot <br/>\nof anger and frustration. &quot;That&#39;s not one of your choices&quot; is one of my <br/>\nfavorite phrases in making things clear to Jayn. Now I don&#39;t even try to <br/>\ntake her in to the bedroom or go in myself unless *she* is truly ready and <br/>\ntired, because it isn&#39;t worth a battle.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the real crux of it. When Jayn is having some kind of issue that is <br/>\nmaking her behavior challenging in my judgment, the answer is for me to <br/>\nchange what I can change - which is MY attitude and MY behavior and MY <br/>\nresponses. Because when I am trying to change who she is, the results are <br/>\nanger and stress.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust like I put a lot of energy over the years into keeping her quiet rather <br/>\nthan disturb our neighbor below. Just like I would always take her for a <br/>\nwalk or carry drawing stuff rather than let her disrupt other diners in <br/>\nrestaurants. Just like I don&#39;t let her cut in lines but have various little <br/>\ngames and toys to keep it fun. Just like I didn&#39;t let her twirl in her <br/>\naunt&#39;s chotchkie filled living room. Just like I don&#39;t let her monopolise <br/>\nthe only swing at the park for hours. Just like I don&#39;t let her talk loudly <br/>\nin the movie theater. Just like I ask her to keep her shoes on at the <br/>\ngrocery store. Just like I prevent her from touching things at museums. <br/>\n(These last two are Jayn&#39;s cheerful contributions to this list).<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; But I&#39;m suspecting that somewhere back there she was told she has <br/>\nrights that she doesn&#39;t  naturally or legally have.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSee above.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is stemming entirely from information that I have given in the course <br/>\nof looking for help clarifying my thinking. I kinda thought I had pretty <br/>\nmuch put this to rest with the reply I made the other day. I&#39;ve been <br/>\nthinking it over since then, and truly I think it is temperament and <br/>\npersonality, not some wrong information that I&#39;ve given her. Have you more <br/>\nreasons to believe this than what I have said over the last couple of days? <br/>\nIs there something in any of my posts from long ago that you can remember <br/>\nthat I could look at?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think she is interested in finding how far her edges are in the world. I <br/>\nsee part of my role as parent to help her keep within the limits of decent <br/>\nand lawful behavior, until such time as her own empathy and good sense show <br/>\nher the value of those limits. In this I include such information as the <br/>\nidea that people hearing a child screaming at 2am might call the police, and <br/>\nthe police might call CPS and while we have good food available and a <br/>\nreasonably clean kitchen and bathroom, we would still be placed under <br/>\nscrutiny and our freedoms within our home curtailed. I see the unschooling <br/>\nangle being how I do this, with kindness and understanding and the <br/>\nassumption that she is doing her best and will learn in time, without the <br/>\nnecessity for arbitrary &quot;practice&quot; limits or imposed punishments.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in the end, most of the time, really the vast majority of the time <br/>\nunless she gets particularly hungry or is extra tired (which would be my <br/>\nresponsibility to notice the signs of and address), she is very pleasant, <br/>\nkind, generous and courteous outside of our home with friends and strangers <br/>\nboth.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of days ago I found Jayn sitting a bit weepy on the sofa. She told <br/>\nme that she is sorry she has been mean to me. I thanked her and she suddenly <br/>\nsaid, &quot;I know it&#39;s been for about two years&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

We<br/>\nhave TiVo, so lots of flexibility.  I&#39;ve also ripped about 50 of his<br/>\nfavorite DVD movies to AVI files.  And I often save his favorite shows off<br/>\nthe TiVo to a PC and convert those to AVI.  Besides the PC, we have 3<br/>\nlaptops in the house including his own, for YouTube and movies.  His laptop<br/>\nhas over 100 AVI files on it...all his favorite movies and shows, plus<br/>\nseveral completely new ones that I&#39;m strewing on there.  And he has a Cowon<br/>\nA2 which is a Portable Media Player (PMP) kinda like a video ipod, but<br/>\nbigger, more features, and a 4&quot; screen and 10-hour video battery life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got him his own laptop and the PMP several months ago, when I first sensed<br/>\nany screen &quot;competition&quot;.  I was just looking for ways to expand his options<br/>\nand *our* options (plus the PMP is awesome for plane and car trips...no<br/>\ndiscs to organize/transport/scratch).  And it works, sometimes.  But here<br/>\nlately when his mom or I want to watch something on the big screen, he<br/>\nstarts yelling for one of &quot;his&quot; shows.  It doesn&#39;t seem to matter how much<br/>\nhe&#39;s already watched that day.  If I&#39;m working from home that week instead<br/>\nof flying away to a client, I&#39;m down in my basement office all day, and he<br/>\nwatches whatever he wants all day.  After I finish work, we wrestle and<br/>\notherwise play hard, then a couple hours later I start winding it down, tell<br/>\nhim I want to watch something on the TV so let&#39;s take some toys to the<br/>\ncouch, and 75% of the time he resists it.  We offer to put whatever he wants<br/>\non his laptop or PMP, including new DVD&#39;s he&#39;s never seen before (in his<br/>\nlaptop).  But, no, he wants to watch &quot;the big TV&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we&#39;ve been talking about getting a second TV for several months, but it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem like a good option.  Because, along with wanting to watch the<br/>\nBig TV, he also wants one/both of us in the room *with* him.  Putting a TV<br/>\nin the bedroom or guest room or downstairs in his basement playroom or in my<br/>\noffice...we&#39;ve offered all of those suggestions, and he nixes them.  He<br/>\nwants to watch THE big TV, in the family room, with us there too, period.<br/>\nIt seems like the best option right now would be to put a second TV in the<br/>\nfamily room, but then we&#39;d have the competing noise.  We all cosleep, so<br/>\nwe&#39;ve never setup a &quot;bedroom&quot; for him.  He has the entire big basement as a<br/>\nplay room, but that&#39;s it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not into TV that much.  I like watching MotoGP motorcycle racing when<br/>\nit&#39;s in-season, and other than that I watch Jon Stewart and Colbert once or<br/>\ntwice per week (on the TiVo, not live, sometimes watching 2 or 3 episodes in<br/>\na row in one night, on Thursday).  With those, I just wait for him to fall<br/>\nasleep, and help facilitate that by watching something with him until he&#39;s<br/>\ndozing cradled in my arm.  He and I both love Spongebob and sometimes South<br/>\nPark, so he falls asleep to one of those at least 2 or 3 nights per week.<br/>\nHe and I have gotten into the new Time Warp show (super-hi-speed cameras<br/>\nfreezing cool events) the last couple weeks.  And he/mom/I all enjoy Two and<br/>\na Half Men, although I think he mainly enjoys the audience laughter while<br/>\nwe&#39;re laughing at the raunchy humor (I had a roommate in the mid-90&#39;s who<br/>\nwas a narcissistic &quot;player&quot; type like Charlie, plus was a bodybuilder, so<br/>\nCharlie is doubly funny to me).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs of today, I think that even if I bought four new 40&quot; TV&#39;s and spread them<br/>\naround the house, each with their own TiVo box and DVD player, he would<br/>\nstill want to watch whatever TV I/mom were interested in at that moment, but<br/>\nwith a different show (&quot;his show&quot;) on it.  We have a Wii, but he&#39;s not very<br/>\ninto it yet.  We all play it a total of 3-4 hours/week.  And if mom/I want<br/>\nto play a Tennis match on it, for even a half hour, we have to wait until he<br/>\nis VERY occupied with something (more difficult now that it&#39;s colder and the<br/>\nbig backyard isn&#39;t as attractive to him).  We have a sitter every Friday<br/>\nnight, and while we initially hired her so we could go out for a Date Night<br/>\n(he doesn&#39;t like sit-down restaurants), about half the time we stay home.<br/>\nHe plays with the sitter downstairs (big basement), and we (as a couple,<br/>\nwith a 2-month-old attached to mama) read or snuggle.  Sometimes we&#39;d like<br/>\nto watch TV or play Wii as a couple, watching a show that he wouldn&#39;t enjoy,<br/>\nbut we avoid that because the few times we&#39;ve tried it, he comes running<br/>\nwanting one of &quot;his&quot; shows.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo solutions for you Kim, but it&#39;s helping me to type this.  I do intend to<br/>\nget a 2nd TV, as others have suggested.  I just don&#39;t know where in the<br/>\nhouse it will go.  And I&#39;m still struggling to figure out the ways we the<br/>\nparents are contributing to this Competition dynamic.  Back in the spring,<br/>\nit was pretty obvious...my wife or I would just say, &quot;No, you&#39;ve had the Big<br/>\nTV for X hours today, and now WE want to watch something, so that&#39;s what<br/>\nwe&#39;re going to do&quot; and we&#39;d spend 5 or 10 minutes trying to help him choose<br/>\nsomething else to watch/do on his laptop holding and consoling him as he<br/>\ncried about it, etc.  We were in a tense place in our marriage, she was<br/>\npregnant, I was more cranky, and the whole house had an edge to it.  And<br/>\neven though his laptop is on the kitchen counter, really IN the family room,<br/>\nhe only seems to want to watch it when it&#39;s his idea.  If we ask if he wants<br/>\nto watch some new and cool on his laptop, he resists.  Today is completely<br/>\ndifferent in that our marriage is solidly back on track, yet I&#39;m thinking<br/>\nthat those couple months of being more coercive/firm about the TV around<br/>\nMarch/April are still playing out in his attitude and actions.  -=b.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBrad in Boulder, CO<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://holcombs.org\">http://holcombs.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: (Video game and TV time) newbie problem....LONG!","postDate":"1228317547","msgId":40765,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU5OTM0RkFDLUIyQjEtNDcyQi1BNjEwLTdDRTkxMjNBNDIzNkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIyOTc5Ni43NTc0MS5xbUB3ZWI1MTEwOC5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDIyOTc5Ni43NTc0MS5xbUB3ZWI1MTEwOC5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":40764,"nextInTopic":40766,"prevInTime":40764,"nextInTime":40766,"topicId":40729,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Probably before the expansion though     I was just informed this morning by Alec that they haven t even released the end game bosses yet for Wrath ;)","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1199267934\">-=-Probably before the expansion though  &lt;g&gt;   I was just informed  <br/>\nthis morning by Alec that they haven&#39;t even released the end game  <br/>\nbosses yet for Wrath ;)   patches that are yet to come,  I guess.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn March at the HENA conference, Kirby is going to talk about  <br/>\nBlizzard some--about what jobs people work there, and tell some  <br/>\nstories about the legal department and the internationalness of some  <br/>\nof the games,  and the Chinese WoW points/gold (?) farms and such.   <br/>\nHe does have some good stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard expansion stories that I didn&#39;t understand, from several  <br/>\npeople around me.

Partly, I&#39;m not afraid to tell  <br/>\nmy kids what I think is true about the effects of their behavior.  I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t know if it&#39;s just personality differences or they&#39;ve seen me be  <br/>\nright or what.   Did Jayn&#39;s ideas about her rights and the idea that  <br/>\nshe can refuse to leave a party when it&#39;s ended come from messages  <br/>\nbased on unschooling discussions?  Because if so, I think it set up a  <br/>\nbad contract (without people having thought of it that way) way  <br/>\nearly--that she &quot;had rights&quot; to do what she wanted.    In our family  <br/>\nit was always privilege and gift, so instead of one big &quot;do whatever  <br/>\nforever&quot; that we had to be frustrated about it was &quot;Can I do this?&quot;   <br/>\nYes!   &quot;Can I do it longer?&quot;  Not this time, sorry.    &quot;Can I do it  <br/>\nnext time?&quot;  We can come back tomorrow, even.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went out of our way to find them cool opportunities and they were  <br/>\noften (not always) aware that they had more fun lives than some other  <br/>\nkids, and so they cooperated with us to maintain that mood and momentum.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Enacting &quot;you can watch tv in the bedroom as long as you are  <br/>\nquiet&quot; in an attempt to sleep myself has been a disaster.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not something you can enact, when it&#39;s her behavior.  I would&#39;ve  <br/>\nsaid &quot;It&#39;s just not okay.  I have a physical need to sleep, your dad  <br/>\nhas to go to work, NOBODY would think it&#39;s okay--not the neighbors,  <br/>\nnot child welfare, not the police, not a judge.  You can lie down  <br/>\nnext to me and be quiet, or you can listen to music with headphones,  <br/>\nor you can watch a movie quietly, but those are  your choices right  <br/>\nnow.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-It&#39;s frustrating because clearly conditions and/or &quot;if/then&quot;  <br/>\ncontracts have worked really well at Sandra&#39;s and Joyce&#39;s houses by  <br/>\ntheir own histories, but their kids accepted them. And mine WON&#39;T.  <br/>\nMaybe she&#39;s just flat contrary.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe she&#39;s genetically resistent.  Maybe there are personality  <br/>\ntraits that are clashing with yours?  But I&#39;m suspecting that  <br/>\nsomewhere back there she was told she has rights that she doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nnaturally or legally have.

One was asked what was the most surprising thing that he had <br/>\nlearnt. I&#39;m going to quote directly from my copy here.<br/>\n<br/>\nTom Bouchard:<br/>\n&quot;My really big surprise was that when we started studying twins reared apart <br/>\nI clearly expected there would be some traits that were entirely <br/>\nenvironmental and some others that were heavily influenced by <br/>\ngenetics....Well our first glance at the data...showed that this was clearly <br/>\nwrong. When more data came in from other studies, including data from twins <br/>\nwho had not been separated, the answer became even more obvious - genetic <br/>\nfactors are important for almost every behavioral trait and become even more <br/>\nso over time.<br/>\n    One of the problems was that when we first analyzed the data we didn&#39;t <br/>\ndifferentiate the twins by age. We were pooling observations from <br/>\nadolescents, teenager and even adults. Well, we now know that there are <br/>\nsizable environmental influences early in life, while genetic factors become <br/>\nincreasingly powerful over time. This is exactly the opposite of <br/>\nconventional wisdom...We all assumed that environmental effects would <br/>\naccumulate. So when you look at an adult, you&#39;d expect a larger influence <br/>\nfor environment and a lessened effect for genetics. It turned out to be <br/>\nexactly the opposite.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey were looking at monozygotic twins reared apart and at families with <br/>\nunrelated children close in age adopted into the family:<br/>\n&quot;Monozygotic twins reared apart provide a good estimate of the influence of <br/>\ncommon heredity; unrelated children adopted into the same home gauge the <br/>\ninfluence of the common family environment.&quot;<br/>\n(I am taking the word &quot;common&quot; here to mean &quot;shared&quot; rather than <br/>\n&quot;ordinary&quot;.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this has clear implications for parenting, especially the importance <br/>\nof Attachment Parenting in infancy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Until recently breastfeeding was part of<br/>\nhis night time routine, a good way to calm him down after being so active.<br/>\nIt seems he has given that up to playing wii! Where has my baby gone?! (He<br/>\ncould be my only child.) I am worried about leaving him awake downstairs all<br/>\nalone. It doesn&#39;t seem like 4 is old enough to allow that kind of behavior<br/>\n(is this my mainstream brain talking?) and is it safe? Is it cruel or kind?<br/>\nWe are all night owls here, but sometimes he can outlast us old parents! Dad<br/>\ndoes have to work in the mornings. Weekends we are all up late together.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think the biggest anxiety factor is when Damon (the DS) plays wii all day<br/>\nand into the night, going to bed at 4:30am and sleeping until 1:30pm or so,<br/>\nwhich happened the other day! We checked the console stats and he played for<br/>\n13 hours. We are on a totally different schedule from most people! I was OK<br/>\nwith it being off, I love sleeping in too, but as it slides further away<br/>\nfrom the norm, it just feels even weirder. It is hard to make plans unless<br/>\nothers are available in the afternoons or evenings. Will we ever get back on<br/>\na semi-normal sleep pattern? We can&#39;t even meet Daddy for lunch (our usual<br/>\nfun bonding ritual) because when he calls at 1pm to make plans, Damon<br/>\nprobably just woke up and we&#39;re not ready to go anywhere.<br/>\n <br/>\nI hear you Robyn and Jenny about having strong willed children!!!<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;From the outside looking in it looks very clearly like thet<br/>\nonly reason there is conflict in your family is because someone is trying to<br/>\ncontrol your son away from his passion. It is hard to force children away <br/>\nfrom their passion in the absence of rules/punishments and in the presence<br/>\nof caring about their feelings. Whenever we try to control Jayn in similar <br/>\nways - reducing her choices - because we are locked into some idea of <br/>\n&quot;enough&quot; that is not her idea of enough, the negative results are very <br/>\nsimilar. She will fight for what she sees as her rights. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n======================================================<br/>\n <br/>\nI know, I feel it too, and I can&#39;t figure out how to come to terms with it.<br/>\nIn writing, I discovered that a lot of the frustration on the part of my<br/>\nhusband is because he has to fight with his son for tv time, something he<br/>\nholds dear and uses as a way to unwind after a long day at work. We used to<br/>\nplay games together, before Damon got his passion ignited. I like the word<br/>\npassion better than obsession. I couldn&#39;t think of a better way to put it, I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want obsession to seem negative. Passion is better.<br/>\n <br/>\nI suppose we should talk about a 2nd TV. We are supposed to be remodeling my<br/>\nlarge (read: wasted space) office into more of an office/play room and have<br/>\nplans to put a tv there. So then does the wii go there or is that where<br/>\nsomeone goes to watch their shows? We like playing on the big screen!<br/>\n <br/>\nDH is not fully on board with unschooling, just so you know. He thinks we<br/>\nare lazy parents and I&#39;ve latched onto this term to describe, make sense of,<br/>\nand sort of validate my lazy lifestyle. I don&#39;t see it that way, but it&#39;s<br/>\nhard to have a comeback when he thinks we did nothing all day. He recently<br/>\nsaid our son would be better off in school. He says he has so much potential<br/>\nand he is wasting it; he can&#39;t read, he can&#39;t write, he won&#39;t let me cut his<br/>\nhair or go get it cut so it&#39;s all shaggy in his eyes, he doesn&#39;t use the<br/>\npotty (what he actually said was the kid sits around in his own feces, which<br/>\nis true but if I go near him to clean him up, with NO meanness whatsoever,<br/>\nhe hits and kicks and throws things at me, even calls me names while I try<br/>\nto get him to just lay down then he stops so we don&#39;t get the carpet messed<br/>\nup and steps nicely into a fresh pull-up), and he wastes his days playing<br/>\nwii. I said with a laugh, well I&#39;d like to have his life! <br/>\n <br/>\nThis did not help and the arguement only got worse. He is concerned that<br/>\nDamon will not be prepared for the real world, like we are living in a<br/>\nbubble or fantasy world. I tried to explain that he has incredible dexterity<br/>\nand strategy planning skills. He has mastered games rated for 10 year olds!<br/>\nIn 3 weeks!He knows enough math to know if he can buy a new character or not<br/>\n(or just clicks the button to see if it lets him). He knows who won when we<br/>\nplay against each other. He can read enough to know which menu to choose and<br/>\nhow to change options and settings as he sees fit. But because Daddy said<br/>\n(in front of him) that he can&#39;t read, he isn&#39;t reading anymore. He has<br/>\nmemorized books (since he was 2) and when I ask him to read me those<br/>\nstories, he says he can&#39;t read. I say he can read some, or he knows the<br/>\nwords of how the story goes and that is the beginning of reading. <br/>\n <br/>\nDoes this sound harsh? Is this familiar to anyone, having a spouse doubt<br/>\nwhat you are doing when they are at work? He says this is his life we are<br/>\nmessing with and I say that&#39;s something I think about every day, and I will<br/>\nnot let him be squashed down by the public school system or have his spirit<br/>\ncrushed by anyone. I don&#39;t really want to think about divorce! Can we get to<br/>\na better talking place? What can be done when 2 parents have different ideas<br/>\nof what is &quot;right&quot; for their mutual kid?!<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kim in Oregon<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185586397,"authorName":"Lyla Wolfenstein","from":"&quot;Lyla Wolfenstein&quot; &lt;lylaw@...&gt;","profile":"lylawolf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: (Video game and TV time) newbie problem....LONG!","postDate":"1228287455","msgId":40747,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgyMUY5MTE4Q0YxMTRFMEI5QzQxNDc2NDVENDVERUEyQExZTEFMQVAyPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQwRDlFNUM3RTMzMTQ1NzlBOTI5QTBCODdCMjBERTU5QFJvYnluUEM+","referencesHeader":"PGdoM2FraStucWtvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NTk2MTMyLjgxMzcyLnFtQHdlYjYzNzA2Lm1haWwucmUxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPEJEQUQxN0U1LTczMEYtNDQ1Qy04QUIyLTAyQUE3REFDNDU5OEBtYWMuY29tPiA8OERCOTk1NjQtRjAwMi00OUJBLTg4NTctMkQxOEM2MjcxNUVFQG1hYy5jb20+IDwyMDQxMS45NzA4Ni5xbUB3ZWI2MzcwNC5tYWlsLnJlMS55YWhvby5jb20+IDwwNTBiMDFjOTU0ZDkkMjg4ZGFlMjAkMDUwMWE4YzBAR29uem8+IDw0RjRDNTFBNS1BOTRBLTQ0MzEtODUxNi1COTEwRUYxMEZFQ0VAc2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDw0MEQ5RTVDN0UzMzE0NTc5QTkyOUEwQjg3QjIwREU1OUBSb2J5blBDPg=="},"prevInTopic":40746,"nextInTopic":40750,"prevInTime":40746,"nextInTime":40748,"topicId":40729,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It s frustrating because clearly conditions and/or if/then contracts have worked really well at Sandra s and Joyce s houses by their own histories, but their","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2082687505\">It&#39;s frustrating because clearly conditions and/or &quot;if/then&quot; contracts have <br/>\nworked really well at Sandra&#39;s and Joyce&#39;s houses by their own histories, <br/>\nbut their kids accepted them.

There has been an interesting study <br/>\ndone with chimpanzees about the difference between &quot;unwilling&quot; and &quot;unable&quot;, <br/>\nthat is part of one episode of  &quot;The Baby Human&quot;. Chimps and children can <br/>\nsee the difference between the two. Chimps get furious very fast by the <br/>\n&quot;unwilling&quot; to give them the treat, (like taunting) and are sanguinely <br/>\nacceptant of &quot;unable&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the absence of punishments how did you insist that 10pm or the other <br/>\nconditions are complied with when your kids were that young and empathy had <br/>\nnot yet awakened?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat has been my problem since forever, every time this idea, the &quot;if/then&quot; <br/>\ncontracts idea, comes up. Jayn tests the &quot;contract&quot; every single time. All <br/>\nthese contracts have ever done at our place is turn Jayn into a contract <br/>\nbreaker, so I&#39;ve let go of them and I discourage dh from trying to make them <br/>\nwith her. Because we don&#39;t want to live in rules/punishment mode, the only <br/>\nconsequence has been our frustrated disapproval, or future based threats <br/>\nlike when Jayn refuses to leave the party when it has ended,  &quot;This behavior <br/>\nmakes me unwilling to bring you back next time&quot; or &quot;People won&#39;t want to <br/>\nspend time with you if this is how you treat them&quot;.

It used to be that if she was <br/>\nrowdy in our one bedroom, and wanted me to stay awake and watch the movie or <br/>\nplay with her no matter how exhausted I was, the only recourse was to return <br/>\nher to the living room, and punish her (as she sees it) by leaving her there <br/>\n(with the same movie, a snack and a blanket). She would return to the <br/>\nbedroom shortly, crying, and I would still have to get up and go turn off <br/>\nthe electronics if we wanted to save the power.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is now 100 pounds. I can&#39;t carry her anywhere anymore so now I don&#39;t go <br/>\nto bed until she is ready or fallen asleep on the sofa herself. I sometimes <br/>\nnap near her as I have said. I tell her when I am tired, but it is not worth <br/>\nmy own anger over the poking and noisemaking to go to bed with her still <br/>\nalert, and if I leave her in the living room she cries and howls for me. <br/>\nPlus it is very important that I protect dh&#39;s sleep now that he is working <br/>\nfull time.

It is hard to force children away from their passion <br/>\nin the absence of rules/punishments and in the presence of caring about <br/>\ntheir feelings. Whenever we try to control Jayn in similar ways - reducing <br/>\nher choices - because we are locked into some idea of &quot;enough&quot; that is not <br/>\nher idea of enough, the negative results are very similar. She will fight <br/>\nfor what she sees as her rights. I doubt that introducing or resorting to <br/>\npunishing behavior like holding down the button is going to be helpful in <br/>\nthe long run. Sometimes Jayn has an expectation that her dad is going to try <br/>\nto control her and be pushy even before he starts to talk to her, so she <br/>\ncomes in to a conversation (about changing the tv channel,or sharing a bag <br/>\nof candy with him for examples) with defenses up. I have found that the best <br/>\nthing is almost always to accept her no unconditionally, not argue, and that <br/>\nfrees her to choose to be generous and kind after a few minutes. Encouraging <br/>\ndh to see it that way and act accordingly is not always easy when he is <br/>\nstuck in a place of &quot;she should...&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m reading that maybe the real problem is a conflict over resources. If you <br/>\nonly have one tv set and your son is monopolising it, then I guess your dh <br/>\nis feeling hard done by. Can you work on that issue? Can you get another set <br/>\ndedicated to the Wii? I expect that a bunch of used tv&#39;s will become <br/>\navailable cheaply very soon with the changeover from analog to digital.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish Jayn would let me go to bed while she stays up alone in the living <br/>\nroom! She is too scared to be alone and cries. I can&#39;t drag her to the <br/>\nbedroom before she is ready to sleep because she disrupts dh&#39;s sleep with <br/>\nimpatient, rowdy behavior. So in the past I have napped on the sofa. I do <br/>\nthis rarely now because it hurts my back (really saggy in its old age - er <br/>\nthe sofa I mean) but maybe that would work for you. I&#39;m looking forward to <br/>\nthe time when Jayn will have her own room so that she will have a space she <br/>\nfeels safe to be alone in (I hope) and of course it will include her gaming <br/>\nsystems and her own satellite linked tv set. We&#39;ll work out which system <br/>\nwill be in the living room in due course.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW you can take your old games and dvd&#39;s to the Game Stop or EB Games, and <br/>\nprobably other games stores too, and trade them in to get discounts on new <br/>\ngames and gear. Your ds might like a Nintendo DS with the similar games to <br/>\ntake with him to places.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Good for you! It was funny to read your words as it happened!<br/>\n <br/>\nI am struggling with the same thing and can&#39;t quite put my finger on what is<br/>\nbothering me. Maybe by typing I will figure it out?!<br/>\n <br/>\nMy son is 4 and loves to play wii. I&#39;m trying to remember how it all<br/>\nstarted. My husband got the wii for his birthday almost 2 yrs ago (Jan) from<br/>\nhis mom (who called every store every day until she got one at 7am!) and<br/>\npreviously we were not a gaming family. DH played computer games on his own<br/>\n(I played some on my own too, but not much). DS was 2.5 at that time and we<br/>\ndidn&#39;t think much of exposing him to the wii. He was able to play the<br/>\nsimpler games with us like baseball, tennis, and bowling and we enjoyed time<br/>\nas a family. He would join us when he wanted to or do something else if he<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to play. When we got Guitar Hero, DH and I would take turns<br/>\nplaying while DS would jam along on his little acoustic guitar, striking<br/>\nposes and dancing around.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m not sure when, but I think DS got more interested in the wii when we got<br/>\nCars. He could drive all over town for hours, just checking things out (how<br/>\nit&#39;s designed, very cool actually) and playing various driving games. Mario<br/>\nKart was another favorite. At first he would just drive all over, exploring<br/>\nthe track and came in last place every time, but he did not care! It was<br/>\nreally funny to see how much fun he had letting his character drive off a<br/>\ncliff over and over and over! He would jump and squeal with glee! Back then<br/>\nhe could play for a while and then turn it off.<br/>\n <br/>\nIce Age 2 was a turning point. That game required a nunchuk plugged into the<br/>\nwiimote, so the difficulty factor went up! He was often frustrated by what<br/>\nhe wanted his character to do but couldn&#39;t make the moves for and would ask<br/>\nme to do certain moves for him. There&#39;s one timed game that he still asks me<br/>\nto play, so he can advance faster, but he jumps and cheers me on the whole<br/>\ntime!<br/>\n <br/>\nI could write about other woes we&#39;ve had related to the wii, but not sure<br/>\nhow long I want this to get. Here is 1 aside: We got Kung Fu Panda which he<br/>\nabsolutely loved for a while, and would move all over the living room while<br/>\nplaying. He went on a kung fu kick and would do karate moves all day long,<br/>\nwherever we went. Spinning, chopping, kicking, ending with a still pose,<br/>\nhand out, concentrating on remaining still and stealthful. He still does<br/>\nthis sometimes, now with the addition of rolling on the floor on his<br/>\nshoulder and popping up. Anyway, I have a friend I used to get together with<br/>\noften who has a son 14 mos younger than mine and they seem to be good<br/>\nfriends also (although more and more I&#39;m feeling bad for making them be<br/>\ntogether). So we noticed a lot of turmoil when my DS would act out karate<br/>\nmoves on his friend, who would cry and run to mommy. (I believe the problem<br/>\nwas the age/skills gap, not that my son was trying to be mean. We have<br/>\nanother friend who we don&#39;t see as often whose son is the same as mine, and<br/>\nwhen my son did his moves on that kid, he&#39;d do his own right back!) So my<br/>\nfriend claimed that my son was too violent because he watched excessive<br/>\nviolence on TV and in movies and played Kung Fu Panda which is rated for<br/>\nkids 10 and up (because of the cartoonish violence?). She is a public school<br/>\nteacher... &#39;nuf said?<br/>\n <br/>\nSo fast forward to October of this year. I bought Lego Indiana Jones for the<br/>\nwii because I thought he would like it. Also the game seemed harder than<br/>\nother games we had and I thought he&#39;d enjoy working on new skills. We&#39;d<br/>\nwatched Raiders of the Lost Ark and he had totally fell in love with Indy<br/>\nand the adventure of it. (Indy is the reason he added the shoulder roll.)<br/>\nWell, he became engrossed with the game! He played it morning noon and<br/>\nnight! It was really hard to get him to go anywhere with me (even to see his<br/>\nfriends), and if we did get out of the house, he would continually talk<br/>\nabout going home so he could play more wii. In 3 weeks he had completed the<br/>\nentire game, playing some levels multiple times (although I&#39;m sure there are<br/>\nparts he hasn&#39;t done, secrets to find etc. but he did finish the game).<br/>\nDuring this time the 4th movie (Crystal Skull) came out on DVD and DH bought<br/>\nit along with Temple of Doom and Last Crusade (we only had Raiders). So as a<br/>\nfamily we watched one Indy movie a night for 4 nights. (I don&#39;t know what<br/>\nunschoolers think about ratings except it&#39;s probably more about what&#39;s<br/>\nappropriate for each child, but my son LOVED all 4 movies and is hardly<br/>\nphased by the violence. At least he is not afraid of it.)<br/>\n <br/>\nHe saw a preview for the Lego Batman game and began asking me to take him to<br/>\nthe store to buy it. Every day... can we go to Game Stop? How about Target?<br/>\nI was kind of put off because I&#39;d just spent $50 (oops, not true, I&#39;d bought<br/>\nit used for $40) on a game he only played for 3 weeks! I resisted for a<br/>\ncouple of days, saying games were expensive, then I realized I had cashed<br/>\nhis birthday check from my mom for $100. I told him about HIS money and<br/>\nasked him if he wanted to spend it on Batman. (As much as a 4 yr old can<br/>\nunderstand money, but he was included in the process.) We went to Game Stop<br/>\nand found a used copy for $45 (and I saved another 10% with my membership<br/>\ncard!). So $40 was spent and he was happy as a clam. Back home he got to<br/>\nwork on Batman. He played for a week as the heros before I asked if he had<br/>\nunlocked any of the villain levels (which I had read about in the manual).<br/>\nHe said no and was so excited to figure out how to play as a villain! Then<br/>\nhe conquered all of the villain levels. <br/>\n <br/>\nThen he started asking to go buy Lego Star Wars, which is the one I<br/>\ninitially wanted for ME and DH! I sort of resisted rushing right out the<br/>\nfirst moment he asked for it, but 2 days later we were in Target and they<br/>\nhad it for $19.99 so I got it! He thought that&#39;s why we were there anyway. I<br/>\nwondered why it was so cheap, but the salesman said it had come out first,<br/>\nprobably the appeal had worn off with 2 other Lego games on the market. But<br/>\nit is really neat! You can play as any character (you collect/unlock more as<br/>\nyou play) in Episodes 1-6, so any movie. We have seen all 6 movies with him<br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n <br/>\nI really like playing wii with my son... sometimes.... and I&#39;ll pick up a<br/>\nwiimote and drop into his games and drop out if I need to. When he didn&#39;t<br/>\nwant me to play with him, he&#39;d attack my character and kill me multiple<br/>\ntimes until I quit. Now he just says, &quot;I don&#39;t want you to play&quot; which makes<br/>\nme sad.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy biggest problem I thought was how he ONLY wants to play wii all day and<br/>\nall night, but now I think it&#39;s my husband. Or at least the family dynamics<br/>\nthat are going on here. I am trying to support DS in his game playing. I<br/>\nbought him a small lego set with Indian Jones and 2 other characters that he<br/>\ncarries around with him when we go out. We&#39;ve checked out Star Wars books<br/>\nfrom the library, including a cookbook that we have been using. DH has been<br/>\npretty supportive as well, although in a more passive way, sometimes I see<br/>\nhim as too hands-off. <br/>\n <br/>\nI often retreat to my office in the basement late in the evening to catch up<br/>\non email, read group posts, or to do actual work for my job, and leave the 2<br/>\nof them in the living room. DS plays wii and DH either reads a book, sleeps<br/>\non the couch, or does something on his laptop. At some point (1-2am?!) I<br/>\nwill go upstairs to find DH either asleep or gone to bed and DS still<br/>\nplaying wii. I usually announce that I am going to bed and ask if he wants<br/>\nto join me. He usually says no, he wants to keep playing wii, eyes fixed on<br/>\nthe tv and not me. I know he is tired. He looks like a zombie already. I say<br/>\nhe can come up with me and I&#39;ll help him brush his teeth, get into his<br/>\njammies, and read him stories. If he wanted to stay down here and play, he&#39;d<br/>\nbe all alone because I was tired and going to bed. He usually opts to go<br/>\nwith me, but sometimes he really puts up a fight about playing. This is<br/>\nwhere it gets weird for me. I want him to go to bed, but I don&#39;t want to<br/>\nforce it. I do say he can play more tomorrow. I try to hold him in my lap<br/>\nand give him a break from staring at the screen so he might see that he<br/>\nreally is tired. He might sit quietly and decide he is tired, or he might<br/>\nwiggle away and fight with me. I don&#39;t really feel all that comfortable<br/>\nleaving a 4yr old downstairs playing wii by himself while I go to bed (where<br/>\nDH is already snoring), but once I actually did it. I went upstairs and<br/>\nbrushed my teeth and went to bed. I read a book for a while then turned out<br/>\nthe light. I couldn&#39;t sleep though. DS kept playing, then quit the game and<br/>\nturned off the wii and the tv and the lights and came to bed (we co-sleep),<br/>\nprobably 3am. He was asleep in under 2 mins. The next morning I woke up<br/>\nbefore DS, but I got out of the shower to find him on the couch playing Star<br/>\nWars again!<br/>\n <br/>\nLately DH has been more stern about the wii playing. He was OK with it for a<br/>\nwhile, but is getting uncomfortable with the amount and intensity of DS&#39;s<br/>\nwii obsession. Once he hid all of the wii remotes and I had to appologize to<br/>\nDS because I didn&#39;t know where they were. DH prefers to watch a movie or<br/>\nMythbusters while we all eat dinner (which seems to be a reasonable request)<br/>\nbut DS will ignore requests to turn the wii off. DH will say we&#39;re making<br/>\ndinner, you can play until it&#39;s ready. Dinner will be ready in 5 minutes,<br/>\nyou might want to quit when you get to the end of a level. Two minutes. Then<br/>\ndinner goes into the living room and he makes one more try (which I don&#39;t<br/>\nlike, but he seems out of options) and says pause the game now or I&#39;m going<br/>\nto turn it off. DS usually pauses, but has also ignored his dad, at which<br/>\npoint Dad goes to the box and holds down the power button. Then there is<br/>\ncrying and screaming and rolling on the floor. If the wii remote gets banged<br/>\ndown, there is yelling about how that&#39;s not how to treat things, or be<br/>\ncareful or you&#39;ll break it and not get to play wii anymore! (Last night he<br/>\nsaid this and DS said but there&#39;s 2 more wiimotes up there.) I chimed in and<br/>\nsaid but if you break 1, then all 3 of us won&#39;t be able to play Mario Kart<br/>\nat the same time. The equipment is expensive, please take care of it.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt sounds like others have had this issue with game obsessions, but I got<br/>\nthe impression it was usually with older kids who had gone to school and<br/>\nwere in the process of deschooling. It feels so weird for a 4yr old who has<br/>\nnever gone to school to be this way, and often feels like our family is out<br/>\nof control. We only have 1 TV and DH is missing his shows a lot! When he<br/>\ngets his &quot;turn&quot; with the tv, he&#39;ll usually watch 3-4 hrs of recorded shows<br/>\n(DVR) and DS will get antsy and keep asking to play wii again. We&#39;re not<br/>\ngetting to play our games anymore. We recently did get Star Wars out of the<br/>\nwii and all played Mario Kart. DH and I reunited our band (I play bass) on<br/>\nGuitar Hero Aerosmith and played til our fingers hurt! <br/>\n <br/>\nIt bothers me that DS does not really want to do anything besides play wii.<br/>\nI usually don&#39;t force too much, just give him options. I did force an outing<br/>\nyesterday. We met up with some other unschoolers at a kid-friendly pizza<br/>\nplace with play structures!!! He knew one of the girls already and we met a<br/>\nfew more. He had a great time playing there, but it was hard to get him<br/>\nthere. Then when we were packing up to go, he said I want to go home and<br/>\nplay wii.<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks for letting me pour it all out here! Sorry it got so long!!

He is learning hand eye cordination, he is learning new skills and trying to master levels (trying to succeed in what he is doing), pushing himself to get better and better on every level, he is playing with his brother (age 3) and sister (age 4) and teaching them how to play which in turn is teaching them hand eye coordination (he never liked to play with his brother or sister when he was going to public school, why I don&#39;t know), and he is sharing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not understand why I let TV bother me either. He watched various &quot;educational&quot; shows (History Channel, Animal Planet, Travel Channel, Weather,Food Channel and so on). These shows make him interseted in other things so he searches for books on those topics at the library.On top of that, I think he is a visual learner. I think he learns better watching tv then reading a million words a day. Why didn&#39;t I see all this before!<br/>\n<br/>\nHuh! It is like a huge light just popped on in my head. And it is what you all have been saying all along. My children are learning ever minute of everyday. I feel silly now. I am still gonna do a fully deschooling process because my family still needs this, but I feel better knowing that even while deschooling they are still learning no matter what we do. It is almost like even if you wanted to you can not escape learning something in some way, shape, form or fashion. Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLeAna<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Pamela Sorooshian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Tuesday, December 2, 2008 2:23:37 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: New to the group and unschooling. A little lengthy but need some help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEven in that long post I just wrote, I left out something important.<br/>\n<br/>\nRespect and honor your child&#39;s interest by giving them the space and <br/>\ntime to enjoy and pursue it without unwanted interruptions. Long hours <br/>\nof uninterrupted play time or viewing time are one of the gifts we can <br/>\ngive our kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people find that their kids become miserable and cranky or <br/>\naggressive when they spend a long time playing video games or watching <br/>\ntelevision. I think this is often due to not eating enough, but also <br/>\ncould be that those young bodies need more activity. Solve the first <br/>\nproblem by keeping them fed - put plates of easy-to-nibble- at foods <br/>\nnearby - crackers and cheese and sliced apples or grapes or pieces of <br/>\nleftover turkey. Get insulated coffee cups with lids and put chicken <br/>\nor veggie broth in them so they can sip at it and it stays hot. Also, <br/>\nmake sure the game is physically comfortable - watch him play and see <br/>\nif things need to be moved around. Does he need a better chair? Higher <br/>\nor lower screen? Lighting changed so it isn&#39;t reflecting in the <br/>\nscreen? Better speakers? Also, if playing computer games, is the <br/>\ncomputer fast enough for the game? It can be really frustrating to try <br/>\nto play a game on a computer that isn&#39;t really quite adequate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a little concerned that my long list of examples of how you can <br/>\nsupport and expand and build on video game and tv interests could make <br/>\nsome people think that they should constantly barrage their child with <br/>\nother things to do. Be sensitive and be aware of whether your offering <br/>\nideas is welcome and whether it seems be well accepted. You&#39;ll build <br/>\ncredibility as your offerings are discovered to be worthwhile.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40807,"nextTopicId":40492}}
