I thought about going but it was in the winter and I decided not to go and save the money for a different trip. Turns out we will now be visiting New Zealand in September which is being referred to as winter by all the people in New Zealand I&#39;ve spoken to. I like to call it early spring. It sounds so much better.......  Anyway, I researched Vienna a little and I was thinking about taking the kids to see the Lippizzaner Horses     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lipizzaner.com/home.asp\">http://www.lipizzaner.com/home.asp</a>    I don&#39;t remember the cost. There is a practice or warm up that can be attended, but I read that can be disappointing in that they don&#39;t do the jumps/dance. I don&#39;t know if they have a museum with video.<br/>\n25 years ago I was in Salzburg and went on a salt mine tour. If you aren&#39;t already going to Salzburg, you might consider a day trip by train. I think my kids would love this, but we don&#39;t ever travel by train in the States so it&#39;s a different and fun thing to do. I remember the salt mine being fun. We rode on a small train into the mine and I remember going down long wooden slides once inside. We also dressed like miners.  www.SalzburgTours.net   I&#39;m not sure now if this is the mine I went in, but it would give you a general idea of what it is. I think there could be a silver mine closer to Vienna.<br/>\nI have horticulturist as parents so I always look for gardens and botanical centers when traveling. They usually have wide open spaces for kids to run. I think Vienna might have a castle or two with  beautiful gardens.<br/>\nBeing a cello player, I had also thought about looking into classical music performances and opera. I would have needed a park performance that was kid friendly but decided not to go before searching very long for that type of thing. I think it would be great fun to see an opera that was done with kids in mind.<br/>\nMeg<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":139171607,"authorName":"Katrine Clip","from":"Katrine Clip &lt;katrine@...&gt;","profile":"kaclip","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] ideas","postDate":"1281307809","msgId":56742,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlrLUctdlp4cXhoc1VIMmc9QytEaWJLa2pYNl9jQkEwWXZPZEV5VUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGkzajJzdCtvb2YzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGkzajJzdCtvb2YzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":56734,"nextInTopic":56754,"prevInTime":56741,"nextInTime":56743,"topicId":56732,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We really loved the Karls kirche at Karls Platz. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Charles%27s_Church,_Vienna.
