We<br/>\nuse unrefined sugar for cooking, baking and table<br/>\nsugar, which tastes identical to the bleached stuff. <br/>\nWe also use honey for cooking, baking and sweetening<br/>\ndrinks, and occassionally molasses or organic whole<br/>\nmaple syrup.  All of these sweeteners are not hard to<br/>\ncome by, are infinately better for us, and taste a lot<br/>\nbetter too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe also don&#39;t buy a lot of pre-cooked, processed foods<br/>\nfor several reasons.  Again, we have preservative<br/>\nallergies which makes avoiding them a no brainer.  I&#39;m<br/>\na pretty good cook, and the pre-made stuff just is<br/>\ndisappointing when I think about what I could have<br/>\nmade with similar basic ingredients.  When we are<br/>\nshopping, we look for food options without corn syrup<br/>\nor added sugars.  With all the food allergies in our<br/>\nfamily, we&#39;re definately label readers.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this doesn&#39;t mean we are food nazi&#39;s, or that the<br/>\nkids never get candy, or we never enjoy a burger.  We<br/>\njust try to make choices from the less toxic options. <br/>\nEven the kids prefer the organic honey caramels to the<br/>\nrefined ones, or the granola with fruit to the sugary<br/>\ncereals, or real juice to sugary punch drinks.
