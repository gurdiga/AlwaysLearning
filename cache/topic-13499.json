He&#39;s working hard to find a new<br/>\njob, but this damned war (as I like to call it) is not<br/>\ncondusive to hiring.  Fortunately we spend less than<br/>\nwe make and live simply, so we are able to eke by on<br/>\nwhat we had, his retirement savings cashout from his<br/>\njob and our tax return.  We&#39;re both looking for part<br/>\ntime work to keep us afloat before that money runs<br/>\ndry, and if another job in his field does not present<br/>\nitself before that time.
