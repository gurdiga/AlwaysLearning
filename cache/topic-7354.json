She was too much puzzled to make any other <br/>\nremark. <br/>\n`Ah, you should see &#39;em come round me of a Saturday night,&#39; <br/>\nHumpty Dumpty went on, wagging his head gravely from side to <br/>\nside: `for to get their wages, you know.&#39; <br/>\n(Alice didn&#39;t venture to ask what he paid them with; and so you <br/>\nsee I can&#39;t tell YOU.) <br/>\n`You seem very clever at explaining words, Sir,&#39; said Alice. <br/>\n`Would you kindly tell me the meaning of the poem called <br/>\n&quot;Jabberwocky&quot;?&#39; <br/>\n`Let&#39;s hear it,&#39; said Humpty Dumpty. `I can explain all the <br/>\npoems that were ever invented--and a good many that haven&#39;t <br/>\nbeen invented just yet.&#39; <br/>\nThis sounded very hopeful, so Alice repeated the first verse: <br/>\n&#39;Twas brillig, and the slithy toves <br/>\nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe; <br/>\nAll mimsy were the borogoves, <br/>\nAnd the mome raths outgrabe. <br/>\n`That&#39;s enough to begin with,&#39; Humpty Dumpty interrupted: <br/>\n`there are plenty of hard words there. &quot;BRILLIG&quot; means four <br/>\no&#39;clock in the afternoon--the time when you begin BROILING <br/>\nthings for dinner.&#39; <br/>\n`That&#39;ll do very well,&#39; said Alice: and &quot;SLITHY&quot;?&#39; <br/>\n`Well, &quot;SLITHY&quot; means &quot;lithe and slimy.&quot; &quot;Lithe&quot; is the same <br/>\nas &quot;active.&quot; You see it&#39;s like a portmanteau--there are two <br/>\nmeanings packed up into one word.&#39; <br/>\n`I see it now,&#39; Alice remarked thoughtfully: `and what are <br/>\n&quot;TOVES&quot;?&#39; <br/>\n`Well, &quot;TOVES&quot; are something like badgers--they&#39;re something <br/>\nlike lizards--and they&#39;re something like corkscrews.&#39; <br/>\n`They must be very curious looking creatures.&#39; <br/>\n`They are that,&#39; said Humpty Dumpty: `also they make their <br/>\nnests under sun-dials--also they live on cheese.&#39; <br/>\n`Andy what&#39;s the &quot;GYRE&quot; and to &quot;GIMBLE&quot;?&#39; <br/>\n`To &quot;GYRE&quot; is to go round and round like a gyroscope.

Not only intimidated, but <br/>\nangry that you have helped a lot of people. There is a huge amount of <br/>\njealousy imo.<br/>\nSome people crave power, others simply enjoy being activists, there is a big <br/>\ndifference.<br/>\nI enjoy activism on the unschooling front (now that I finally, really get it <br/>\nmyself) as I think most of the people here and over there do.<br/>\nBut some people just want to control. They want new people to come to them <br/>\nand follow their advice. They want everyone to notice them. And when most <br/>\npeople are noticing others, they have to throw little tantrums to get the <br/>\nattention back to themselves.<br/>\nCombine that with the intimidation factor, and you&#39;ve got a conniving, <br/>\njealous, insecure problem.<br/>\nugh.<br/>\nI think the intimidation with you Sandra, is because you can back up the <br/>\nthings you say with solid facts.  A lot of people get put off when the words <br/>\nthey say get questioned over and over but the person questioning is always <br/>\nable to back up their point.<br/>\nI know that was hard for me at first.<br/>\nBut then it caused me to think more carefully about what I was saying and <br/>\nwhether it was true or not.
