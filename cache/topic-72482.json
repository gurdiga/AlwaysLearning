They want the best for their children and they want to protect them. <br>It must be a biological thing as baby animals are more vulnerable and parents are their only protection against outside dangers.<br><br>So parents read/hear that Video Games changes brains and they are very scared! Never mind that the more they study it the more&nbsp; it shows that they changes are for the best! That it now only heals the brain but it is amazing for learning.<br><br>Parents read/hear that while watching TV the brain is in an Low Alpha state. OH MY Gosh that must be bad! Never mind that is the same state as a brain in a meditative state is and\n how meditation&nbsp; is considered a wonderful thing!<br><br>Parents read/hear that kids&nbsp; behavior is affected by sugar consumption and that kids go crazy. Never mind that all the studies prove that not to be the case and that young brains need sugar!<br><br>&nbsp;But unschoolers that have been doing this and observing and discussing they&nbsp;&nbsp; have&nbsp; been saying that for a long time because they stopped, thought about it, watch their kids, discussed the ideas, read about it, tried doing it and now&nbsp; they are here sharing what has been their experiences.<br>&nbsp;Why is that important?<br>It is important because children&nbsp; studies are usually&nbsp; correlated to school and school performance, To being away from parents most of the waking hours in an environment that can be hostile and&nbsp; being there many times against their will . Those kids have NO choice.<br><br>Unschooling children do not have that. They have choices, time\n to play and explore, attentive parents, great relationships with parents that partner with them, a rich learning environment&nbsp; as parents are always discussing how, what to bring more interesting things to their lives. <br>&nbsp;<br>This is what was seen here. A parent that is asking because she/.he wants to make sure they are doing their best. That they are providing opportunities, bringing in the world to be explored, that they are being present and participating.&nbsp; Yes there are people who think unschooling parents sit back and&nbsp; let the kids *lead* the way. There is&nbsp; neglect in the worse cases.&nbsp; That is not the kind of unschooling people are talking about here.<br><br>&nbsp;So for parents of young kids I&nbsp; repeat what Sandra has been saying:<br><br>&quot;Read a little, try a little. Wait a while. Watch&quot; and someone added &quot;Repeat&quot; I think!<br><br>I talked about &quot;Safety on the Unschooling Path&quot; this year . It was because I have\n observed so many families with young kids that said they were going to unschool only to go the opposite way once the kids were a little older.<br><br>If you are doing something out of fear it cannot lead you to unschooling better. Knowledge, deep thinking, lots of choices, connection, joy, learning, partnership and&nbsp; a little research maybe and&nbsp; absolutely looking to your kids is a much better path than one full of fear and no choices.<br>Is your child happy playing video games?<br>Is he learning? <br>Is he doing it&nbsp; but has many other choices he can pick and not out of no options?<br>Are you connecting with him and supporting him?<br>&nbsp;Are you feeding his passion with&nbsp; things you bring in that relate to the game? ( books about his games, movies, videos, concerts with video game music, music, instruments like in the game, visiting places, and so much more!)<br><br>&nbsp;Ask yourself those questions and think about them.&nbsp; I\n doubt a parent will still be afraid of video games if they truly&nbsp; look at their children, or join them, and&nbsp; ask themselves those questions.<br><br><br><div><span><br></span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><font face=\"courier\">Alex Polikowsky</font></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.polykow.blogspot.com/\"></a>&nbsp;</div><br><div style=\"font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;\"><div style=\"font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt;\"><br> </div> </div>  </div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":372417994,"authorName":"Patricia Platt","from":"Patricia Platt &lt;pnplatt@...&gt;","profile":"plattpatricia@ymail.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Bored Son, not sure what to do next","postDate":"1383829205","msgId":72518,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBRVhyTktwOVNGY3JzczA3X1pabnBKa1VPUlQwNStBWDI5aHJ5aTdHM0FSTVNvQXVUUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":72516,"nextInTopic":72519,"prevInTime":72517,"nextInTime":72519,"topicId":72482,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m so glad Karen S listed those terrific books about the importance of play.

Here&#39;s another one that I&#39;d make &quot;required reading&quot; for every parent if I could:<br><br></div><div>- &quot;Play: How It Shapes the Brain, Opens the Imagination, and Invigorates the Soul,&quot; by Stuart Brown. <br>\n<br></div><div>There&#39;s all kinds of good stories and research in this book about the importance of unrestricted/controlled play. Brown isn&#39;t writing about videogame playing here, but his principles definitely apply. It turns out that unrestricted play makes people smarter, more socially intelligent, more creative, more adaptable, better problem solvers, and on and on with the positives. On the flip-side, restricting and controlling play among children is NOT a good thing. In fact, extensive research among murderers in prison has shown one thing they all had in common: their parents rigidly controlled their play as children. In particular, Brown studied Charles Whitman, the engineering student who climbed the campus tower at the University of Texas at Austin and shot 15 people, including a pregnant woman. Here&#39;s an excerpt: &quot;But the incredibly thorough investigation of Charlie&#39;s whole life revealed a more surprising factor. After extensive interviews with everyone who had entered Charlie&#39;s life, it became clear that the *lifelong lack of play* had itself been an important factor in his psychopathology.&quot;  (pp 95-96)<br>\n<br></div><div>Here&#39;s a related, important point, especially for parents who think they know better than their children what kind of play is good for their children: what is play to one person is not necessarily play for another person. Children are built to learn what&#39;s necessary to survive and thrive as adults in their culture. That&#39;s why so many adolescents today are so drawn to videogame playing. They know instinctively -- often better than their parents -- that computer literacy is critical to their success in their lives as adults. Peter Gray makes that same point in this article, where he compares limiting videogame playing to restricting bow-and-arrow play for a hunter-gatherer&#39;s child: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201201/the-many-benefits-kids-playing-video-games\">http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201201/the-many-benefits-kids-playing-video-games</a><br>\n<br>And, finally, I second Karen&#39;s recommendations. I have read some of these books twice!:<br><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;<br>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;Reality is Broken - Why Games Make Us Better and How They Can Change the

because we never added up the hours, but I do know that giving him unlimited access to video games did not turn him into an addict, or a zombie, or anything else so evil and scary sounding as that - just like giving him unlimited access to the TV and Netflix didn&#39;t turn him into an addict, or a zombie…&nbsp;nor in fact did unlimited access to Legos, books, Nerf guns, etc.

style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:15px;\"><br></span></font></div><div><font face=\"Georgia\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:15px;\">This summer, he spent many, many hours Minecrafting while FaceTiming or Skyping with friends. &nbsp;Some days, the Minecrafting/FaceTiming would start before breakfast and continue with few breaks until well into the night. &nbsp;Other days, he&#39;d stop for a few hours and we&#39;d go out to the beach or to a park or playground, or we&#39;d get&nbsp;together&nbsp;with friends, or do other such things. &nbsp;Some nights instead of playing, he chose to watch movies or Star Trek episodes or documentaries&nbsp;about&nbsp;the Vikings or Roman history or such (whatever&nbsp;was of interest on a particular day) and he&#39;d ask questions and we&#39;d Google all sorts of information and learn even more interesting things…&nbsp;So even in a summer that was very full of gaming&nbsp;there&nbsp;was still other activity too, even if that other activity was somewhat buried in a sea of crafting&nbsp;and&nbsp;chatting about crafting :-)</span></font></div><div><font face=\"Georgia\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:15px;\"><br></span></font></div><div><font face=\"Georgia\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:15px;\">As the summer wrapped up, his interest in Minecraft continued, but suddenly the time he spent playing the game waned and he began asking to go out much more. &nbsp;Somehow along the line of a mostly-gaming-filled few months - probably (I&#39;m guessing) related to trips we took to the beach, walks through nature-filled old cemeteries, etc. - he had developed an intense interest in birding, and the draw of being outside trying to spot a new bird, walking trails, searching for rarities, etc. surpassed the draw to mine and build. &nbsp;</span></font></div><div><font face=\"Georgia\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:15px;\"><br></span></font></div><div><font face=\"Georgia\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:15px;\">So now, he plays Minecraft some days not at all, some days for an hour here or&nbsp;there&nbsp;- but mostly he bounces into our room in the morning and asks &quot;So guys, where are we going today???!!!!&quot; immediately upon waking up in the morning, and soon after breakfast he wants to be on the road to a park, wildlife refuge, nature&nbsp;reserve, etc. &nbsp;If he&#39;s not leafing&nbsp;through&nbsp;field guides and picking out birds he&#39;s hoping to see, he usually plays Pokemon or another game on his DS on the way to wherever we&#39;re going - but once we arrive, he leaves the games in the car and heads out into the woods with his binoculars in hand. &nbsp;He has begun to start many conversations with&nbsp;phrases&nbsp;like, &quot;Someday when I work for Audubon….&quot; - or &quot;Someday when I am crawling through the Alaskan tundra stalking&nbsp;good&nbsp;photos of elusive birds…&quot; and though neither his dad nor I have ever suggested a particular career path to him (as we want him to find his own path - if he&#39;s happy as a game programmer, an artist, a gas station attendant, a naturalist, or anything else, his happiness is our priority!), I admit I do smile at the idea of him keeping his love for nature and birds with him into his adulthood :-)</span></font></div><div><font face=\"Georgia\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:15px;\"><br></span></font></div><div><font face=\"Georgia\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:15px;\">I could probably write about this forever :-) but I&#39;ll give just one more example of how video games aren&#39;t all-or-nothing with my son (or any other child I know - every child I&#39;ve ever met does have other interests in addition to gaming :-)) -&nbsp;</span></font></div><div><font face=\"Georgia\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:15px;\"><br></span></font></div><div><font face=\"Georgia\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:15px;\">This past weekend, he and his dad went to Minecon in Orlando - two whole days of celebrating and enjoying Minecraft. &nbsp;He had really wanted to go&nbsp;and&nbsp;asked us to try to get tickets - which we were lucky enough to be able to do (they&nbsp;sold out very quickly). &nbsp;He loved every minute of the convention (he&#39;s still talking&nbsp;about&nbsp;it now, days later - and he&nbsp;asked us to&nbsp;promise to get tickets to&nbsp;the&nbsp;next one too&nbsp;:-)). &nbsp;But he also asked to take time while in Orlando to go birding, to explore the area, to eat out, etc. &nbsp;There was a gaming area set up at the convention, and my husband and I would have been totally a-ok if he&#39;d wanted to sit and game for 2 days&nbsp;straight&nbsp;- or if he wanted to go to a panel every hour, or chase famous YouTubers for autographs - or&nbsp;whatever&nbsp;would make him happy. &nbsp;But he didn&#39;t want to do only Minecraft-related things. &nbsp;He wanted to be at the convention and meet online friends in real life, tour the exhibits, go to a couple panels - but he also wanted to mix it up by getting out and seeing some of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Orlando area. &nbsp;</span></font></div><div><font face=\"Georgia\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:15px;\"><br></span></font></div><div><font face=\"Georgia\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:15px;\">All in all, if we had put pressure on him, or tried to discourage him from spending this summer with Minecraft, or from spending whatever weeks he spent trying to beat Mario Galaxy, or from gaming for&nbsp;exactly&nbsp;as much as he wanted to - if we had said &quot;yes you can go to Minecon but you better do other things too!!&quot; - he wouldn&#39;t have had the experience of making choices of what to do with his time based on what he wants for himself - and we would have been minimizing his interests and his&nbsp;priorities&nbsp;rather than supporting him in what he loves and giving him the opportunity to learn what he likes and how he&#39;s happy spending his time. &nbsp;My husband and I want to raise a child who knows what he likes, and knows that it&#39;s ok to try different things because no one will decide that he Has To do this and he Has Had Enough Of that. &nbsp;And so far, that seems to be what we&#39;re doing :-)</span></font></div><div><font face=\"Georgia\"><span

Minecon 2013 is on YouTube already, they explain the&nbsp;project. &nbsp;They also talk about it in the older 2012 Opening Ceremony. &nbsp;It&#39;s pretty cool. &nbsp;Minecraft and the UN - a very,

Why is that?","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-481091524\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Isn&#39;t it strange that so many 10-11 year olds are interested in the SAME thing (computer games)? Unschooling is an autonomous exploration of life that follows the person&#39;s  interest so it is a very individually tailored journey for every child, and yet when they discover video games it seem to become the main interest for so many of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why is that?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI would encourage you to spend some time learning what people, young and old, learn from playing video games.     <br/>\n<br/>\nHave a look at one game called Minecraft has to offer it&#39;s players:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI0BN5AWOe8\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI0BN5AWOe8</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s only *one* game.  In our home playing a variety of video games has inspired so many activities both on and off the computer.  Here&#39;s a incomplete list of some of those activities: <br/>\n<br/>\nwatching informational videos and custom animations, <br/>\n<br/>\nreading wikipedias,<br/>\n <br/>\ndesigning and writing our own programs using mods or visual programming languages like Scratch, <br/>\n<br/>\nemploying drawing tools to make our own characters or copy those we are inspired by,<br/>\n<br/>\nusing a digital keyboard and sound recording tools for music and video,<br/>\n<br/>\nlearning to play some of our favourite video game music on the piano,<br/>\n <br/>\nemploying photo and video editing tools,<br/>\n<br/>\nmaking our own stop motion animations using clay, chalkboard drawings, found object pieces, drawing, and computer animation,<br/>\n<br/>\nexploring a huge variety of favourite music on YouTube and Spotify - much of the music first discovered while playing video games.  (Here&#39;s one example of my personal favourites.  I have a lot of favourites.  ;-)  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6PGZskrw-Q)\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6PGZskrw-Q)</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s just off the top of my head, and barely makes a complete list of how video games have enriched our learning.  I&#39;m sure there are ways in which it has done so that I may never fully comprehend.  Such is the nature of learning.<br/>\n  <br/>\nSo you ask us Why...And I ask you, Why not?!  :-)  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s just so much to explore.  So much more offered today than ever before.  Why wouldn&#39;t young people want to take full advantage of that?  I most certainly and enthusiastically do!  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome books you might find shift your thinking could include:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Reality is Broken - Why Games Make Us Better and How They Can Change the World&quot; by Jane McGonigal<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Everything Bad is Good For You&quot; by Steven Johnson<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy&quot; by James Paul Gee<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Killing Monsters - Why Children Need Fantasy, Super Heroes, and Make-Believe Violence&quot; by Gerard Jones<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And it also seems that these children whose curiosity was nurtured from babyhood focus their interests on computer games and the rest of the world with its &quot;off the couch&quot; activities don&#39;t seem very exciting after that.?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That has not proven to be a reality in our home.  Although my son clearly loves the learning that happens via video games and other media activities, he also loves exploring anything and everything that sparks his curiosity in the world at large.  It&#39;s not one or the other.  It&#39;s all connected, influencing and enriching every new and familiar experience.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA simple example of this might be found in a creek bed like the one we found a couple of months ago near home.  Ethan discovered a fairly thick layer of clay.  He was thrilled and started playing with it.  He said &quot;This reminds me of the clay in Minecraft.&quot;  Then he went on to talk about the similarities and differences between real world clay and Minecraft clay, all the while conducting his own experiments with how the clay dissipated in water and flowed downstream, how it clung to the rocks when drawn with, how it could be shaped, and how it could splat and explode on various surfaces.  Then he went home to see how his findings compared to the game design, and talked later about how he would improve the clay properties if he was designing the game himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems that parents are developing special strategies to get the children out of the house, to get them interested in other activities.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I see it as my responsibility as an unschooling parent to provide my son with the richest learning experience I can, both inside and outside of the home.  I make every effort to surround him with things I know he enjoys doing, and I try to find and introduce new things to our days to see if it (and how it) sparks new connections and curiosities.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI, by the simple act of being on this earth 32 years longer than my son, have a little more experience in the world.  I have adult friends who share their experiences with me as well.  Consequently, I may know or have access to more of what is out there than Ethan currently does.  (Although, I must admit, he is rapidly catching up, and in some instances bypassing me in knowledge.)  So, I do my best to expose Ethan to information and activities I know and find, not to strategize or manipulate him into doing what *I* want him to, but to offer up some things he might not have known about previously, as well as to help him get his needs met and build on his current interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s also fun for me.  That&#39;s a bonus.  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe I&#39;m getting it all wrong and it is not like this at all. After all I don&#39;t live with any of these children and don&#39;t see their intense interest in many other things other then compute games. It just seems that parents often single out playing computer games in their discriptions more than any other activity. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For blog readers out there...I&#39;m wondering if there is a good blog that shows us how an unschooling family lives with, and thoroughly embraces, all the learning technology has to offer while, at the same time, illustrates a greater involvement in the community and the world at large.  I was thinking of authoring one, but I&#39;m not sure if I would be the best candidate.  Maybe there are one&#39;s I&#39;m not familiar with?</div>","specialLinks":[{"url":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/M6PGZskrw-Q?wmode=opaque","type":"VIDEO"},{"url":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/RI0BN5AWOe8?wmode=opaque","type":"VIDEO"}]},{"userId":420468373,"authorName":"Lisa Celedon","from":"Lisa Celedon &lt;lisajceledon@...&gt;","profile":"lisajceledon","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Bored Son, not sure what to do next","postDate":"1383767095","msgId":72511,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVBQzNBODUzLUFFQTItNDlDNS1CNDdFLUNBRUMwM0Q5ODQ3NEB5YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":72510,"nextInTopic":72512,"prevInTime":72510,"nextInTime":72512,"topicId":72482,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I (a 32 yr old mother of 2) LOVE video games.

I was seeing not only the joy but all the learning he was doing. Soon after when he was I found a game called Roblox online that was pretty new and we made an account for him. That game was an amazing opportunity for me to see him learn and for my son. It is now 6 years later and his character is still known by veterans.

She enjoys spending her days gaming and Skyping, watching her favorite Minecraft You Tubers, creating stories with her Pokemon and assorted other toys, and watching Digimon (recently several weeks almost nonstop), and Pokemon and a few other things. She finds something she likes and pretty that is the focus for weeks or months. I have gotten a Minecraft and Animal Jam account and we play together or watch Youtube videos together. I know who all her favorite people are and often send her Facebook links when I think there&#39;s something/someone she&#39;ll like. I&#39;m not as good at sitting down and doing the creative play since I need to constantly be moving, so I&#39;ve had to find other ways to stay engaged and share her joy. &nbsp;<br><br>Her interest in staying home vs going out seems to be cyclical and it&#39;s helped me to realize that and be ready for when she&#39;s ready to do a lot of time away from home. We do normally try to get out a couple of times a week, usually for ice cream or some other treats, or the zoo or something else I think falls in line with her interests. Recently, we moved to a much larger house that offers her a lot more space to spread out all her toys, and lots more fun stuff outside and in the neighborhood. New insects and other wildlife have has caught her attention (we even found a walking stick) and she&#39;s become interested in finding out more about local wildlife. I&#39;ve made sure to make those new things exciting for her. She saw snow for the first time last year, and this year it&#39;s the changing of the leaves. I guess my excitement has rubbed off because she&#39;s been pointing out particularly colorful trees or ones that she&#39;s noticing change, and she&#39;s begun to collect leaves which we bring home to look them up together, and then become beds for her favorite toys.<br><br><br>Last week I stopped by the library and picked up two books which I plan to poke through with Caitlyn for some ideas. You might leave something like them around for your son to pick up or for you to look through together.

But I have kept one day a week free from other comittments and we jokingly call it our school trip day.

He is also a lover of home and an avid gamer, so they may have some similar interests.  I will share some ideas that have worked well for us, but I think it&#39;s most important that you observe what he does like currently (in the games he plays, or in the ideas he expresses), so that you can help him build on his existing interests as well as introduce new activities and ideas that might spark something unexpected.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a pull up bar from our kitchen to our living room.  Ethan likes to swing on it.  He has also tied rope to it and used it with the rope in a number of interesting ways.  Some examples included making it into a swing, experimenting with it to see how waves travel along it, making it into a type of pulley.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a small trampoline in the house that has been in both the living room and Ethan&#39;s bedroom.  When in the living room, he would often jump on it while watching tv.  In his bedroom he uses it to bounce out ideas he has when he is playing games on his computer, or when he&#39;s excited about an accomplishment he&#39;s achieved in a game.<br/>\n<br/>\nOutside, pogo sticks have been a big hit with my son and our friends.  We also have a slack line and an outdoor trampoline.  I use the slack line and the trampoline with Ethan.  He loves that.  I try the pogo stick, but I&#39;m not great at it.  We also go bike riding from time to time.  A couple of times we planned a bike trip around our neighbourhood in search of a geocache.  That was fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have nerf guns that we have played with together in the front and back yards.  I&#39;ve set up obstacle courses and hidden targets for something different and challenging.  We throw frisbees and play tag around the yard too.  Recently we played a fun game where one of us took a close up photo of something in the yard, and the other one had to find it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve made a variety of different paper airplane designs and thrown them off our back porch.  We&#39;ve dropped eggs off the porch in a variety of protected housings.  Did you know that you can actually walk on a carton of eggs?!  (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiRw-PzLiXQ)\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiRw-PzLiXQ)</a>  I haven&#39;t tried that yet, but I think Ethan would love that one.  I&#39;m looking forward to surprising him with a few cartons of eggs on the driveway and seeing what the results are!  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve made soda geysers and pop rockets outdoors.  Usually, I set it up and invite him out to watch me.  Most often he wants to give it a go after he sees me.  Sometimes even before I get a chance to try it.  :-)   Giant bubbles have been a big hit as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like to find things that have some unexpected reaction, because that delights Ethan.  One of Ethan&#39;s favourite video games a few years ago was called Crazy Machines.  It was then I discovered that he loved cause and effect type relationships, so I always keep an eye out for anything like that.  Recently, I found this popsicle stick chain reaction (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stevespanglerscience.com/lab/experiments/popsicle-stick-chain-reaction)\">http://www.stevespanglerscience.com/lab/experiments/popsicle-stick-chain-reaction)</a>, and went ahead and made one of my own to show Ethan.  He loved it!  Dominoes are fun too.  Rube Goldberg type set-ups have been a hit here over the years as well.  Here&#39;s a fun one from Honda to inspire you:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWk9N92-wvg.\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWk9N92-wvg.</a>  You can make these from almost anything you find in the house.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor most of these activities, it works best with Ethan if I get involved first.  I have a lot of fun with the kinds of activities I&#39;ve listed.  I think that in itself is contagious enough to encourage Ethan to join me.  From there, he either pursues it further himself, or it becomes something fun that we shared and then cached as a happy memory, maybe to resurrect another day in some unexpected way.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis wrote a nice list of things to do, and Sandra saved it here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/strew/deblist\">http://sandradodd.com/strew/deblist</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWhile your thinking of some ideas to spruce up your days, take some extra time to play his games with him.  Even if he&#39;s using games as a default for the time being, your playing with him will provide him with some variety and company, and will allow you to better understand where his interests lie.

SO he plays games, explores Youtube, Netflix and books. <br>He talks to me, plays a little with his sister and is happy.&nbsp; Maybe do more of the things he likes to do now. <br>Play some games with him, talk about it. watch some good movies together or\n shows!<br><div><span><br></span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><font face=\"courier\">Alex Polikowsky</font></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-702862811y_msg_container\">&nbsp;<br></div><div style=\"font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;\"><div style=\"font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt;\"> </div> </div>  </div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":386666394,"authorName":"","from":"&lt;boisei@...&gt;","profile":"melgqd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"RE: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Bored Son, not sure what to do next","postDate":"1383619771","msgId":72488,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGw1OW1icitxNDhkaGdAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDNzNBMTQ0LTlFMDktNDlDNi1COEQxLUQ0RkIyRDQyQzY5OEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGw1OWJqbCsxNWlldWZtQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4JPDhDNzNBMTQ0LTlFMDktNDlDNi1COEQxLUQ0RkIyRDQyQzY5OEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":72487,"nextInTopic":72489,"prevInTime":72487,"nextInTime":72489,"topicId":72482,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I would love to plan activities out of the house, but when I do or suggest it, he does not usually want to go.
