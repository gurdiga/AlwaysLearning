I often talk about what I already know or believe.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo.  having posted last night I was more present to my goal of being more mindful, more attentive today.  As it turned out my children were all away (never happens) at a friends house so i was home alone all day and it occured to me that if it was appropriate (to this group) I could write a summary of our day and if anyone is interested they could maybe post back where the same conversation or activity in their own house may have led them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat might give me ideas that are relevant.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy boys (age 9 and 10) came home from a friends house with a shooting PS game excited to show dad, showed me (I hate shooting games) I watched, had lots of swearing in it, son said maybe he should turn down volume.  I didn&#39;t answer, he didn&#39;t turn it down.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe played the game until dinner time.  While I made dinner I realised rarely get the boys in the kitchen. so I called the 9yr old and said &quot;do you want to help me? or sit and tell me about your day while I cook?&quot;<br/>\nHe asked if he could help, I said I needed carrots, he asked if he could peel them.<br/>\nended up peeling, grating, then asked if he could set the table.  We don&#39;t often sit at the table so was unusual request.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe added candles and paper towels and tried to wrap the cutlery in different ways in the paper towels.  I googled serviette folding and found some picnic serviettes and proceeded to burn dinner while we learned how to fold a box, this was what he had chosen off  the website I showed him, he found it too difficult and asked if I would make 4 while he finished table. I asked if he wanted to choose something diff to make, he didn&#39;t want to.  He then wrote (thats big) our names on pieces of paper and put them on the table and lit candles for dinner.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe played with dinner and still had most of his plate full when the rest of us were on to seconds.  I asked if he liked it, he said he did, I asked if he wanted to be fed, (he likes to be a baby, tho normally I wouldn&#39;t do this and he wouldn&#39;t eat).<br/>\n<br/>\nI fed him, with all the noises (plane etc) 10 yr old asked to be fed too, was a lot of fun all coming up with vehicles to go in to tunnel.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs leaving table one son grabbed a straw and proceeded to teach me how to make realistic fart noises by placing straw in armpit and blowing.<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t do it but boys did it well and were rolling around on floor crying with laughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nnow all in lounge, one on DS one on PS and hubby doing jigsaw on floor.<br/>\n<br/>\nthats our evening. (daughter at her fathers for night)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would these things have begun at your house, ps looking up the serviettes, for me, was a step up.

I am new on this list and I was hoping someone might say just the right thing to me that will help me see what is perhaps in my blindspot regarding my parenting.  I have changed so so much over the last 8 years. Parenting was very black and white when I started and I was very proud of my consistency and my ability to hold fast to a punishment in the face of pleading and tears etc.  I had a very well behaved daughter as a result and thought I knew a lot about parenting.  I had used behaviour modification well, I shudder now to think of it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sandra Dodds website changed my families life, my whole view of children and control and love, over the last 4 years we have moved through various stages of deschooling and relearning and it has been amazing and all angst about whether or not my children will learn or not has long gone, and the need to control what they do has subsided and I got a wonderful compliment from my now 16 year old daughter when I noticed that if I did have a suggestion, opinion or advice she seemed to follow it, so I asked her why she thought my level of influence was so high and she said, &quot;because I trust you to only say something like that if you genuinely think it is in my best interest and not for your own selfish needs like my friends parents&quot; and I was blown away at how quickly she learned to trust me after years of misguided controlling parenting and I am really proud of how far we HAVE come, however I still have a long way to go and I am stuck.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have 2 more younger children who have benefited from me having transformed a lot of my parenting while they were little.  They sleep when and where they like, do what they choose, are helpful without being made to do jobs and spend their days on the computer, playing in the park with friends or playing lego..mostly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My problem is I am boring.  and I know it and I try and transform it but I keep coming back to boring and I don&#39;t know why I seem stuck.  When the kids were very small I had a dozen or so things I could do..play doh, read to them, tickle fights etc and I had to FORCE myself at first, it felt so fake (well not the tickle fights...I can do that stuff naturally) but games etc felt SO boring that I really struggled, but it did get easier ...still not natural.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  I watch parents who enthusiastically answer their kids questions and I try to be like that...but I can answer the actual question, then I scramble around inside my head for something else to add or do and I come up with nothing. Now that the kids are a bit bigger I can&#39;t think of anything fun or interesting to engage them with, because I don&#39;t find much fun or interesting and they seem happy plodding along but I really don&#39;t like the role model I&#39;m being and I want to find things interesting, but again, when I try and think of things to do that might light them up...well heres the actual list I came up with.

Some people are that way. My partner and I like to hear about people who travel to exotic places or spend a year RV-ing around the country with their kids, but our ideal vacation is this one hotel with a waterpark that&#39;s only an hour&#39;s drive away, plus it&#39;s in a little town with a fun little outdoor mall that includes a really good mirror maze, and it has this one restaurant (two really but they&#39;re actually the same) that is famous for its family-style chicken dinners. So we drive the hour, spend the day at the waterpark, check into our hotel room, where we watch a video or play a video game, get up in the morning and have breakfast at the cafe in the hotel, stroll into town and do the things we do there, come back and spend a big chunk of the day at the waterpark, and then get a chicken dinner on our way out of town.<br/>\n<br/>\nWoo. And also hoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut our whole family _loves_ doing this. (Well, except my partner, who doesn&#39;t actually like getting wet, and only does it for the sake of the kids, God bless him.

You may have to push yourself if your kids want or need to explore more, but they might not need to, or might not need to right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you still want to fly? There&#39;s a small airport near where I live where you can go on a glider ride, and if you like it, take glider lessons. I&#39;d love to try it some day but I think I&#39;d get motion sick...I might try it anyway (what an adventure! I&#39;ve never thrown up in a tiny engine-less airplane before!).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How to you grow passion?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>On the other hand...if you want to start stretching, do it with small steps from where you are. Like I said above, bake something you&#39;ve never baked before. Or bring home some library books or videos about things you&#39;ve never read about before. Watch a TV channel you&#39;ve always just flipped past (my partner and I had the most hilarious fun one night after the kids went to bed a few weeks ago, watching Sadabo Gigante!, a big flashy Spanish-language variety show. He speaks a little Spanish, I speak none. It was great.). Or go to boardgamegeek.com and order a board game of a kind you&#39;ve never played before (my kids and I haven&#39;t played games like Settlers of Cataan, and I look forward to trying that). If part of the problem is that you like being at home, try to bring more of the world home.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, you don&#39;t have to have a big passion to have adventures. Pay attention to the cool things all around you. A couple of summers ago I bought a field guide to spiders, and the kids and I spent some weeks identifying all the spiders we came across in the bathroom or on the front porch. It opened up this whole exciting world that was carrying on right under our feet, all the time. Your kids may well take the lead on this, so if the next time they see something that is new and exciting to them but that you&#39;ve seen a thousand times and stopped thinking about, try to jump into their enthusiasm.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu, mom to Eric, 8; Carl, 6; Yehva, 2.5<br/>\ntapeflags.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":382364493,"authorName":"rewiringma","from":"&quot;rewiringma&quot; &lt;wimvisser@...&gt;","profile":"rewiringma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"stuck","postDate":"1272973109","msgId":53786,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhycDB2bCszM3FtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":53799,"prevInTime":53785,"nextInTime":53787,"topicId":53786,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello everyone.

I am new on this list and I was hoping someone might say just the right thing to me that will help me see what is perhaps in my blindspot regarding my parenting.  I have changed so so much over the last 8 years. Parenting was very black and white when I started and I was very proud of my consistency and my ability to hold fast to a punishment in the face of pleading and tears etc.  I had a very well behaved daughter as a result and thought I knew a lot about parenting.  I had used behaviour modification well, I shudder now to think of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodds website changed my families life, my whole view of children and control and love, over the last 4 years we have moved through various stages of deschooling and relearning and it has been amazing and all angst about whether or not my children will learn or not has long gone, and the need to control what they do has subsided and I got a wonderful compliment from my now 16 year old daughter when I noticed that if I did have a suggestion, opinion or advice she seemed to follow it, so I asked her why she thought my level of influence was so high and she said, &quot;because I trust you to only say something like that if you genuinely think it is in my best interest and not for your own selfish needs like my friends parents&quot; and I was blown away at how quickly she learned to trust me after years of misguided controlling parenting and I am really proud of how far we HAVE come, however I still have a long way to go and I am stuck.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have 2 more younger children who have benefited from me having transformed a lot of my parenting while they were little.  They sleep when and where they like, do what they choose, are helpful without being made to do jobs and spend their days on the computer, playing in the park with friends or playing lego..mostly.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem is I am boring.  and I know it and I try and transform it but I keep coming back to boring and I don&#39;t know why I seem stuck.  When the kids were very small I had a dozen or so things I could do..play doh, read to them, tickle fights etc and I had to FORCE myself at first, it felt so fake (well not the tickle fights...I can do that stuff naturally) but games etc felt SO boring that I really struggled, but it did get easier ...still not natural.<br/>\n<br/>\n I watch parents who enthusiastically answer their kids questions and I try to be like that...but I can answer the actual question, then I scramble around inside my head for something else to add or do and I come up with nothing. Now that the kids are a bit bigger I can&#39;t think of anything fun or interesting to engage them with, because I don&#39;t find much fun or interesting and they seem happy plodding along but I really don&#39;t like the role model I&#39;m being and I want to find things interesting, but again, when I try and think of things to do that might light them up...well heres the actual list I came up with.  Its sat on the fridge for a while with no new things added.<br/>\n<br/>\nbus into town<br/>\nlibrary<br/>\ntoast marshmallows<br/>\nhave hot choc with story<br/>\nread<br/>\nbake<br/>\nbike<br/>\nplay board game<br/>\n<br/>\nand I&#39;ve rotated through it over and over, minus the bike ride as I keep quietly not bringing it up because I can&#39;t think of a worse thing to do (for me)<br/>\n<br/>\nI do things out and quietly count the minutes till we can just go home and I hate that about myself but I am hoping that someone out there didn;t take to being interesting interested naturally and found a way to find inspiration.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote a list of things that I enjoy the other day, was meant to be &quot;what am I passionate about&#39;....took me a really long time to think of anything.  I got... Human behaviour/how brain works, and water slides.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried to think of childhood dreams.  I wanted to Fly... I don&#39;t remember anything else.  I know I very rarely got excited about anything and have always much rather someone told me &quot;what happens&quot; with any given thing ie and experiment, than actually have to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n How to you grow passion?<br/>\nany ideas to help this ball rolling, I figure if the rest of who I&#39;ve been can change so dramatically, so can this, but I&#39;ve been struggling for a few years with this bit,<br/>\nThanks so much if you read this far<br/>\n<br/>\nRM</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53815,"nextTopicId":53881}}
