I find it interesting that people can say that unschooled kids will grow up to be unemployable adults. Maybe it would be possible to find some adults who were unschooled who don&#39;t contribute to society in any way just because anything is a possibility. I don&#39;t have any idea how many unschooled adults are out there and what they are doing. However, there are many, many schooled adults who don&#39;t work, are unemployable and are otherwise not contributing to society. It&#39;s absolutely ridiculous to say that since an 18 or 22 or 24 year old didn&#39;t go to college or isn&#39;t completely self-sufficient that unschooling doesn&#39;t work. If that were true, what does that say about the numerous schooled adults who haven&#39;t done that? When you look at the big picture, statements like that make school look worse, in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlysia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Radical Unschooling Question","postDate":"1272375878","msgId":53488,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhyNnBvNit2MDdmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGcydTNhOTNmZmYxMTAwNDI2MTY1MWgxYzBjZDZlN3g4MWQ0Njg0NzMzYzRlMTg3QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":53478,"nextInTopic":53619,"prevInTime":53487,"nextInTime":53489,"topicId":53415,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"==It IS about feelings.

He said the girl who had the stage crew  <br/>\ncontract works with him at Blizzard, and she&#39;s also an exotic dancer.   <br/>\nShe performed the first night.  I asked him if it was awkward, seeing  <br/>\na co-worker naked.  He said not for him, but his boss didn&#39;t come to  <br/>\nthe festival at all because of that.  He told the boss that Midge was  <br/>\nonly performing on Thursday and that he could come one of the other  <br/>\nnights, but he opted out, Kirby figured for fear of seeing an employee  <br/>\n&quot;out of uniform.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe did indeed get to be a stuntman again the next night, and said  <br/>\n&quot;only one person stuck me with a dart Saturday night.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOH!

And to send my sympathy out into the ether, for what it was worth.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think this list is perfect, but when I&#39;ve tried to join other unschooling discussion lists, it always ends up feeling like there&#39;s just not as high a standard. I recently joined one where the first lengthy discussion I saw was all about what math curriculum to buy. &quot;This is an unschooling list?&quot; I thought. Nobody was even bothering to question whether buying a math curriculum was a good idea or not. I don&#39;t need people telling me to buy a math curriculum; I struggle to let go of the idea that my kids (my oldest in particular) &quot;should&quot; be at a certain level in math and reading. I need people who, if I say, &quot;I&#39;m thinking about doing math worksheets with Eric...&quot; will question that, give me other ideas, tell me stories of how their kids learned and used math.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu, mom to Eric, 8; Carl, 6; Yehva, 2.5<br/>\ntapeflags.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":268230654,"authorName":"delialowell","from":"&quot;delialowell&quot; &lt;nutley1105@...&gt;","profile":"delialowell","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: &quot;instant jobs&quot;","postDate":"1272303966","msgId":53471,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhyNGpndStuMnY5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE0OEFFQUQ0LTVDQjgtNEQ0NC1CQ0VELUY1MkFEMzkyRDM3RUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":53470,"nextInTopic":53472,"prevInTime":53470,"nextInTime":53472,"topicId":53415,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"******* I would appreciate it if people whose kids are enjoying anonymity would step back a bit from telling me I m wrong to have feelings.******* Sandra,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1871153503\">******* I would appreciate it if people whose kids are enjoying anonymity would step back a bit from telling me I&#39;m wrong to have feelings.*******<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra, absolutely.

I can imagine feeling  <br/>\nthat a childhood of joy and laughter would lead to an adulthood of  <br/>\nunemployment and hardship. That you have to pay the piper. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHow true!  We had that story in two or three of our &quot;readers&quot; or it  <br/>\ncame up one way or another more than twice while I was in elementary  <br/>\nschool.  And it was on TV, on some kids&#39; show (Captain Kangaroo,  <br/>\nprobably).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a way to make people feel guilty early and often, if they  <br/>\nweren&#39;t doing what would lead to a long, secure winter.  And maybe  <br/>\nthat came partly from the horrors of the 19th century and early 20th  <br/>\nin general--diseases and wars and the ease with which people were just  <br/>\nput off land they had worked and built houses on.  I know that still  <br/>\nhappens some places, but in Europe and the U.S., it was happening  <br/>\nquite a bit, in various places, in those days.  And for black families  <br/>\nin the U.S.... double disaster with disease and the Great Depression.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo being irresponsible and farting around (or drinking--prohibition  <br/>\ndays in the U.S.) were the worst possible things to do.

All of us who unschool have come from a<br/>\nbackground of having gone to school, and often having had our kids in<br/>\nschool. My oldest was in two schools, as a matter of fact. That<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t make me an expert on schools, but it does give me a base of<br/>\nexperience, combined with my own and my husband&#39;s experience, to form<br/>\nan intelligent opinion about school.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I say something unflattering about school, it&#39;s because I had a<br/>\nreal experience. And I answer the statewide homeschool information<br/>\nline for my state, so I many experiences to draw on from which to form<br/>\nan opinion. People talking about unschooling who haven&#39;t DONE<br/>\nunschooling, or seen it in action in some concrete way don&#39;t have the<br/>\nright to paint any picture of it at all. They can make connections,<br/>\nask questions, have an opinion, etc., but to make any pronouncements<br/>\nabout it such as it couldn&#39;t possibly work, doesn&#39;t really make sense<br/>\nto me at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone says something &quot;offensive&quot; about school, and a reader<br/>\nhasn&#39;t had that experience, then chances are they know someone who<br/>\nhas. If they haven&#39;t and they don&#39;t, then that&#39;s fine too (and a good<br/>\nthing!), but the stories are in the news all the time. It&#39;s not as if<br/>\nwe are making this stuff up!

I told them they didn&#39;t go to school, that<br/>\n&gt; we home-educated them. One little boy got really angry when he heard that<br/>\n&gt; Simon, a boy his age, didn&#39;t go to school. He didn&#39;t want to know that there<br/>\n&gt; was another way. Knowing that there was another way made his suffering<br/>\n&gt; unneccessary. It meant that every morning when he dragged his feet to go to<br/>\n&gt; school and his mom or his dad yelled at him, that was something that didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have to be true. He got angry and he said that Simon and Linnaea had to go<br/>\n&gt; to school and I let it go, because he was 6 and he didn&#39;t need to feel more<br/>\n&gt; lost than he already felt.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve thought about that little boy, who I never really talked to again, it<br/>\n&gt; was just a moment of meeting up on a sunny day in the north of England, and<br/>\n&gt; his shattered belief in the necessity of school and I have hoped that he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; forgotten.

The realisation that a life is better, that<br/>\n&gt; the freedoms that the speaker has are greater than those of their more<br/>\n&gt; traditionally parented peers and how do you say that without hurting the<br/>\n&gt; person you are talking to.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, maybe all those mean commenting folks are so invested in what they did<br/>\n&gt; that they have to justify how it had to work for them and how it has to fail<br/>\n&gt; for our kids and for Holly and Brenna and what a total mess we are making of<br/>\n&gt; their childhoods, that they are angry to see someone articulate, someone<br/>\n&gt; clearly enjoying their life, so they have to tell stories of gloom and doom.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The other day, on the drive to Morris dancing practice, Linnaea and I were<br/>\n&gt; talking about Two and a Half Men. I was comparing the early episodes to the<br/>\n&gt; Ant and the Grasshopper parable and how Alan was the ant and Charlie was the<br/>\n&gt; grasshopper and how the ant always seemed to suffer while the grasshopper<br/>\n&gt; continued to dance in the sunshine. Linnaea hadn&#39;t heard the story of the<br/>\n&gt; ant and the grasshopper so I told it to her and she dismissed it, saying<br/>\n&gt; that she enjoyed working, harvesting, gathering from the garden and that you<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t have to suffer to save. And I talked about how, apparently, ants only<br/>\n&gt; work about 25% of the time, laying around and idling much of the rest of the<br/>\n&gt; time. And she added that most ants are dead before the winter anyhow, at<br/>\n&gt; least in colder climates. But that story was something that was used against<br/>\n&gt; me in my childhood. I was encouraged to be the ant. I was encouraged to look<br/>\n&gt; to the long-term goals over the short-term ones. I can<br/>\n&gt;  imagine feeling that a childhood of joy and laughter would lead to an<br/>\n&gt; adulthood of unemployment and hardship.

Some<br/>\nof these comments are very new.<br/>\n<br/>\n.....<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly had a $10 an hour job working to help set up an art gallery in<br/>\nSilver City. I forgot about that, when I was wasting my time<br/>\nresponding on YouTube. Oh well...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry if I sound harsh, but you could stop taking this stuff so seriously.<br/>\n@$$holes abound on the net. People in the public eye get shit written about<br/>\nthem. You are a star. Holly is a star. You have a great purpose you are<br/>\nfollowing. There&#39;s no sense in letting this stuff get to you. We can&#39;t be<br/>\nuniversally respected and liked if we promote radical ways of thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more boats you shake, the more caustic fallout is going to happen. Its<br/>\nnot criticism of either you or them. It just is. You are a great resource<br/>\nfor those who looked for a better way out of that leaky boat. You have<br/>\nchanged countless lives and have tons of people who appreciate the time you<br/>\nspend thinking about them and their situations. No point being offended by<br/>\nthose who didn&#39;t and chose to plug leaks with great loads of stinky goo.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that it leaves a nasty feeling. Heck, I&#39;ve never met Holly, but<br/>\nI don&#39;t like those comments either. Its just that those crazy people will<br/>\nwrite a few thoughtless comments, which contaminate your joy for half a day<br/>\n(more?), while they probably went on with their lives the minute they hit<br/>\n&#39;send&#39;. Why? Why give them that importance?<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople see what they project. the crap is in their minds. Like the Buddha,<br/>\nwe can refuse to call it ours and leave it at that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry if this offends. Its not that I&#39;m unsympathetic or that I don&#39;t care.<br/>\nI do, but I care about you and Holly. I just don&#39;t see the value in those<br/>\npeople to make them such a focus. I am astounded by you taking those<br/>\ncomments seriously. In your place, I wouldn&#39;t have given them further<br/>\nattention beyond &quot;thank you for providing a sample of what 13 years of<br/>\nschool could have made Holly&quot; and left it at that. Whatever they write, how<br/>\ndoes it matter?

Three little boys came over and started talking to us. They asked about Simon and Linnaea and wanted to know where they went to school. I told them they didn&#39;t go to school, that we home-educated them. One little boy got really angry when he heard that Simon, a boy his age, didn&#39;t go to school. He didn&#39;t want to know that there was another way. Knowing that there was another way made his suffering unneccessary. It meant that every morning when he dragged his feet to go to school and his mom or his dad yelled at him, that was something that didn&#39;t have to be true. He got angry and he said that Simon and Linnaea had to go to school and I let it go, because he was 6 and he didn&#39;t need to feel more lost than he already felt. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve thought about that little boy, who I never really talked to again, it was just a moment of meeting up on a sunny day in the north of England, and his shattered belief in the necessity of school and I have hoped that he&#39;s forgotten. I know there are other children whose lives we have strewn with discontent simply by the choices we have made for our children. I&#39;m listening to the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/listen/teenpanel\">http://sandradodd.com/listen/teenpanel</a> and that comes up at about 23 minutes into the talk. The realisation that a life is better, that the freedoms that the speaker has are greater than those of their more traditionally parented peers and how do you say that without hurting the person you are talking to. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, maybe all those mean commenting folks are so invested in what they did that they have to justify how it had to work for them and how it has to fail for our kids and for Holly and Brenna and what a total mess we are making of their childhoods, that they are angry to see someone articulate, someone clearly enjoying their life, so they have to tell stories of gloom and doom. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day, on the drive to Morris dancing practice, Linnaea and I were talking about Two and a Half Men. I was comparing the early episodes to the Ant and the Grasshopper parable and how Alan was the ant and Charlie was the grasshopper and how the ant always seemed to suffer while the grasshopper continued to dance in the sunshine. Linnaea hadn&#39;t heard the story of the ant and the grasshopper so I told it to her and she dismissed it, saying that she enjoyed working, harvesting, gathering from the garden and that you didn&#39;t have to suffer to save. And I talked about how, apparently, ants only work about 25% of the time, laying around and idling much of the rest of the time. And she added that most ants are dead before the winter anyhow, at least in colder climates. But that story was something that was used against me in my childhood. I was encouraged to be the ant. I was encouraged to look to the long-term goals over the short-term ones. I can<br/>\n imagine feeling that a childhood of joy and laughter would lead to an adulthood of unemployment and hardship. That you have to pay the piper. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, I&#39;m not saying that these folks are forgiveable, just that they are probably miserable. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to work as a writer for a news portal on the Internet, and at some time, I stopped reading comments. I had the feeling that people were commenting only to dump (is this a verb in English ?) their frustration and their unhappiness, and to blame somebody - anybody - about it. YouTube is full of such comments, for what I have seen. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy English isn&#39;t good enough to put it well, but I have the feeling that, somehow, on some level, kids know/feel/guess that what they are told about school isn&#39;t completely right. This whole propaganda. You can buy it or not, but there is a part of you, even a tiny one, who feels that something isn&#39;t right. So when somebody comes, who never had to play this foolish game, who is happy and successful, this person is too often welcomed by anger, and resentment, even hatred. <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: &quot;instant jobs&quot;","postDate":"1272234738","msgId":53423,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI2QzQ2QzU5LTBERTAtNDQ2Ri1CNUY0LTYwNDZEN0I1QTFGNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDJBNjQ2M0VBLTcwNkItNDk0OS1CQTg5LTBDMjA4RkUwQUEwMkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGhyMmFoaittNnVnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MkE2NDYzRUEtNzA2Qi00OTQ5LUJBODktMEMyMDhGRTBBQTAyQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":53420,"nextInTopic":53437,"prevInTime":53422,"nextInTime":53424,"topicId":53415,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Kirby took a day or two of his paid vacation time (I should ve asked him before he went to work; it might have been two days) and his weekend to work a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1132051\">Kirby took a day or two of his paid vacation time (I should&#39;ve asked  <br/>\nhim before he went to work; it might have been two days) and his  <br/>\nweekend to work a temporary job.<br/>\n<br/>\nA female friend of his (sister or friend of a co-worker, someone he  <br/>\nmet socially through co-workers) asked him if he would like to help  <br/>\nher as a stage hand at a small festival.

Parents fall right into it because they don&#39;t want their children to grow up unable to support themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband was a kid that liked school and did decently well.  He tried college and ended up failing too many classes trying to work full time and do school full time.  He never finished.  What he does for a living now, he learned himself.  Someone offered him a job the other day through word of mouth.  I don&#39;t know if he&#39;ll accept it yet, it depends on the details.  He doesn&#39;t have lofty aspirations to be a CEO of a fortune 500 company.  He&#39;s an artist mostly, so work is earning a living for his family, it&#39;s peripheral to what he loves to do.  What he loves to do is hang out with his family, play music, and create things.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo amount of schooling or college could help him do what he loves to do.  At one point he was in a band that was doing really well, getting a lot of reviews, had money, and then one member decided to steal all of that money and skip town.  The means to do what one loves as a way to support oneself financially is partially luck, partially just doing it, and partially talent.  I don&#39;t see anywhere in that, how the lack of school would factor in, unless what you want requires it, and that would be college level things and falls under the &quot;just doing it&quot;.
