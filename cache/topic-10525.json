I don&#39;t<br/>\nbelieve that every parent who applied your methods to their kids would<br/>\nnecessarily get the same outcome.  While I think that your mothering has<br/>\nhelped your children be wonderful, I also suspect that they have some<br/>\ninherent wonderfulness in them.  I&#39;m theorizing that you might have had<br/>\nbetter raw material, through luck of the draw plus parental genetic<br/>\ncontribution than some other mom who&#39;s kid is bull-headed or rockets<br/>\naround the house like a squirrel.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I truly am *guessing* with little real data.  As the mom who&#39;s lived<br/>\nevery minute with your kids, *you&#39;re the one* that has the insight.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know your kids, except for meeting Holly briefly at the<br/>\nconference.  So, just from interactions in this forum, I can&#39;t really<br/>\nknow if as toddlers they were bouncing off the walls and swinging from<br/>\nthe chandeliers &lt;g&gt; but have since been grown wise and been tamed<br/>\nthrough lovingkindness.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn real life I&#39;ve met some very thoughtful attachment parenting moms<br/>\nthrough LLL whose kids were a lot more challenging than mine, and I<br/>\ndon&#39;t attribute it to the mom&#39;s parenting style.  But I&#39;ve been keeping<br/>\na narrow social circle of mostly this type of mom.  I keep my distance<br/>\nfrom extremely conventional moms and choose not to know any drunken<br/>\nmoms.  (OK, I do stay home a *lot*.)  So this helps me give the moms<br/>\ncredit and believe that most of the moms that I know are doing a fine<br/>\njob with their kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line from my life is -- yes my son is sweet and agreeable because<br/>\nhe lives a life full of sweetness and knows that I am on his side.

Could one be wrong?<br/>\nMaybe all across the board some of one&#39;s own assumptions based on one&#39;s own<br/>\ncircumstances won&#39;t fit every family. Is one wrong to focus on the needs of<br/>\nthe children before the needs of the parents? Unequivocally not. The<br/>\noverwhelming evidence of current and past research, that not hidden by the<br/>\nbias to always protect the adult, is that children have needs that if not met<br/>\nat the developmentally appropriate times will be harmed in some way. Is is<br/>\npainful to admit that one&#39;s own parents probably caused a bit of that on one&#39;s<br/>\nown head? Sure it is. Is it painful as a parent to know that mistakes of your<br/>\nown could also cause permanent damage to one&#39;s children? Yes, it is. As<br/>\nparents should our feelings be protected so we can hide our guilt or<br/>\ncomplicity in helping to cause our children pain? I don&#39;t think so, but, the<br/>\nmajority of parents do just that for various reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf children&#39;s very brains and emotions and sanity are threatened by early<br/>\nobedience training that uses harsh methods of coercion and humiliation and<br/>\nphysical punishment then why wouldn&#39;t children who are NOT subjected to these<br/>\nstresses NOT do better?<br/>\n<br/>\nI spent a great deal of time when very young under the care of my 11 year<br/>\nolder sister. Seeing her this summer while she was babysitting two of my<br/>\nnephews, ages 6 and 7, was very amazing for me. It is one thing to know in<br/>\nyour heart that your needs as a child for respect and kindness were not met,<br/>\nand a whole other thing to see the same person who was the vehicle for that<br/>\nbehavior treat other children, thirty years later, much as she must have<br/>\ntreated me. To see that, and KNOW that her model for behavior was my mom and<br/>\nmy dad, and to know how little respect or kindness she herself must have<br/>\nreceived in her turn. It is because I can see working models like this of poor<br/>\nparenting go on and on through the generations that I have no doubt that<br/>\nworking to stop the cycles are so important. Is that arrogant? For me to think<br/>\nI know better than the family of my birth? If it is, I am all for it because<br/>\nSOMEONE HAS TO STOP THIS INSANITY and this terrible waste of human potential.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, this is a bit of a ramble and I didn&#39;t even get to your other points...<br/>\n<br/>\nPeggy </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"arrogance, logic, theories (improved, and more dangerous)","postDate":"1036959444","msgId":10525,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU0LjFlODFkNTkuMmIwMDE4ZDRAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":10534,"prevInTime":10524,"nextInTime":10526,"topicId":10525,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Corrected version  of  arrogance, logic, theories, with the quote restored and the section on political correctness completed.

Perhaps I am arrogant to <br/>\nchoose a politically correct stance and cling to it with feeling.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my thinking:  <br/>\n<br/>\nI HAVE seen families with shit for brains, and while I feel sorry for my <br/>\nkids, I wouldn&#39;t want my kids to hang around with them, nor to marry them, <br/>\nnor to work with or for them, nor to live in their neighborhoods.  [Some of <br/>\nthose families are my blood relatives, which might be about to cause my <br/>\ncurrent theory (not belief, not conviction) to bite its own tail.]<br/>\n<br/>\nEither my kids are genetically superior, and my parenting/homeschooling <br/>\nbeliefs seem right because they&#39;re &quot;just that way,&quot; or they are not superior <br/>\nto other children.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we go with the greatest mythos of the U.S., that all men are created <br/>\nequal, which is just about the only politically correct thing we can do in <br/>\n2002 in the U.S. (NZ, Australia, Canada and U.K. can pass or play on this <br/>\nposition as feels right), then...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only logical or defensible position for me is that my children&#39;s behavior <br/>\nand their abilities (at least in such areas as are considered &quot;scholastic,&quot;) <br/>\nmust be directly attributable to the way they were raised.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow unstable or volatile does my position become if I don&#39;t fully believe <br/>\nthat?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I believe not taking a stand when one<br/>\nbelieves that harm will come from keeping silent is evil.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI do too and have been in trouble more than once in this lifetime, starting <br/>\nat a young age, for saying &quot;That&#39;s not right&quot; to people who were my social <br/>\nsuperiors.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-A stand that forces others to bend their individual will to<br/>\nothers point of view against their individual experience would have the<br/>\npotential for great evil. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only times I&#39;ve had that power were when I was teaching 12-15 year olds <br/>\nin a public school, and when I became a parent.  I think perhaps my many <br/>\nyears of being in the decision making seat with great evil on one side and <br/>\nwhat I saw as my duty on the other have made me arrogant.<br/>\n<br/>\nSO... mathematicians and programmers here, please:   What are our number of <br/>\noptions here?  Let me not suggest a model that&#39;s as pig-ignorant as &quot;either <br/>\nevolution or six day creation.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many combinations of factors are we considering, just in a simple summary <br/>\nof current options?  I&#39;m not a logician and I might have duplicates, and <br/>\nthey&#39;re not probably arranged perfectly.  <br/>\n<br/>\nborn in sin / innocent<br/>\n<br/>\nspanking / no spanking<br/>\n<br/>\ninbred intelligence / empty vessel<br/>\n<br/>\nattachment parenting / techno parenting by the clock<br/>\n<br/>\nadversary / partner<br/>\n<br/>\nbreastfeeding or attempted / unconcerned with even trying<br/>\n<br/>\ndaycare / no daycare<br/>\n<br/>\npreschool / no preschool<br/>\n<br/>\nschool / homeschool<br/>\n<br/>\ncurriculum / no curriculum<br/>\n<br/>\nteaching / natural learning<br/>\n<br/>\nrules / principles<br/>\n<br/>\nmore control / less control<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s a bad set of criteria because there are some (many?) which will <br/>\nexclude or prevent others.  Maybe that&#39;s just the way multiple sets of <br/>\ncriteria go.<br/>\n<br/>\n===============<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&quot;I believe and so must you unthinkingly,&quot; is different from &quot;I believe this<br/>\nand I want you to think about it too.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI never even did that when I was teaching.<br/>\nMaybe I haven&#39;t been so close to evil as my conscience sometimes thinks I <br/>\nhave.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10611,"nextTopicId":10640}}
