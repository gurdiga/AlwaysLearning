But individuals who have  <br/>\nunschooled might have lots to share that you could consider using with  <br/>\nyour family.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is about what to do in lieu of school.  Three year olds  <br/>\naren&#39;t required to be in school, and so unschooling won&#39;t much change  <br/>\nthe fact that your daughter is three and would have been if you&#39;d  <br/>\nnever heard of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nKnowing about developmental steps is good for ANY parent, and  <br/>\nunschooling lives in the real world, not the smaller, artificial  <br/>\nschool-world.  So I recommend reading about three year olds and what  <br/>\nthey understand, and paying really close attention to your daughter to  <br/>\nsee what she really understands.  Many parents will say &quot;Tomorrow at  <br/>\n9:00 we&#39;re going to the zoo, okay?&quot;  and a young child says &quot;okay&quot; and  <br/>\nthe parents then think she understands as much about the conversation  <br/>\nas they did.  If someone were speaking German or French or Spanish to  <br/>\nme, and I was confused but really knew I just wanted them to stop  <br/>\ntalking at me about what I only very vaguely understood, I could say  <br/>\nja or oui or si.  So don&#39;t count on a response to reflect clear or  <br/>\nmature understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I&#39;m an adult, I need to be careful agreeing to things, lest I&#39;m  <br/>\ncommitting myself to some contractual obligation. &lt;g&gt;  NOone would  <br/>\nexpect nor even allow a three year old to enter into a contract.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-My daughter is really clever but not really up to the idea of  <br/>\n&#39;tommorrow&#39; for example and can&#39;t take things like that into her  <br/>\nconsideration about whether to do something or not.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nEven adults should qualify their agreements about tomorrow.  It&#39;s  <br/>\nbetter to say &quot;that would be nice&quot; (a phrase I got from Marty, to use  <br/>\non unreliable friends who promise to come over or do things for us),  <br/>\nor &quot;I&#39;ll try to remember&quot; or &quot;Let&#39;s plan on that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- I am worried if I just let her go for it she will end up really  <br/>\nbattered and worse for wear by the time she finishes childhood.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBy &quot;Let her go for it,&quot; in any sense that she might be beat up by what  <br/>\nshe goes for, I think you might be thinking that unschoolers say &quot;On  <br/>\nyour mark, get set, UNSCHOOL!&quot; and then just lean back on the wall and  <br/>\nwatch them for the rest of their childhoods.  You should do things  <br/>\nwith her and for her all day every day as long as she lives at your  <br/>\nhouse!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, as to &quot;by the time she finishes childhood,&quot; it would help you to  <br/>\nthink of her life rather than her childhood.   She is, right now, the  <br/>\nfullness of the old lady she will someday be.  If you look at photos  <br/>\nof yourself in childhood, that&#39;s YOU you&#39;re looking at, not another  <br/>\nperson, nor even another version of you.  It&#39;s your bones, your skin,  <br/>\nyour hair, your awareness, your growing body of knowledge and memory  <br/>\nand awareness.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you treat her respectfully as a young version of her 30 year old  <br/>\nself, that might help you sort through this news that childhood isn&#39;t  <br/>\nseparate from life, except as school and laws make it so.<br/>\n<br/>\nWow.

He  is now almost 7 and a half and reads amazingly fast.<br/>\nHe started the process of reading and writing around 3.5 years old. He would use foam letters to write things like &quot;Thomas&quot; ( he loved Thomas the Tank Engine).<br/>\nHe recognized   certain words in signs  like Wal-Mart, Hy-Vee, Subway.<br/>\nAt around 5 he was way into video games and new PLAY, GAME, STOP and some other words.<br/>\nBy the time he was 5.5, 6 and beyond he was heavily into ROblox .<br/>\nRoblox is an online game he loves. You can build your own games and play on other player&#39;s games they built. <br/>\n He then wanted to communicate and make friends with other players.<br/>\nThe players can &quot;talk&quot; to each other by either typing their own words or picking from a list of easy phrases like &quot; Do you wanna be friends?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Follow me&quot;<br/>\n&quot; I like your place&quot;<br/>\nand much more.<br/>\nSoon that was not enough for him and I constantly sat with him to read and type. Having a toddler  made me not be available ALL the time so he started typing simple phrases on his own.<br/>\nThen he would ask me how to spell so he could write. That is when he learned ALL the letters.<br/>\nIn the beginning I still typed a lot for him cause I was faster and he wanted fast. <br/>\nMore and more he did it on his own. He got to the point where he barely needed me and would ask me to spell a word just to check if he had gotten it right. That is when I realized he was reading. He was about 6 and a half. <br/>\nAbout 3-4 months later he started reading everything around him out loud. Signs, fliers...What ever he got a hold of.<br/>\nAnd he reads fast. <br/>\nAt the same time he started asking some interesting phonic questions. <br/>\nPhonics was absolutely NOT the way into reading for him.<br/>\nIts amazing the questions he makes about phonis . I wish I remembered some now.<br/>\nHe now loves reading and reads books for older kids , usually books meant for kids 10 and older like Cat Warriors.<br/>\nHe also reads easier books that are funny and loves to read to his sister.<br/>\nBooks are fun to him. Not a chore. Not something hard or difficult.<br/>\nHe types amazingly fast too and reads even faster. Gosh I am a fast reader but he beats me!!<br/>\nHe is also a great speller !
