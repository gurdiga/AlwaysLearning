We all give it a thumbs<br/>\nup! It reminded me of Who Framed Roger Rabbit; that kind of in-humor, so<br/>\nmany visual jokes spinning by that I&#39;ll have to get the DVD to find them<br/>\nall. It was funny that just before the movie I was telling ds about this<br/>\nthread and all the product placement in Cat in the Hat. At one point in the<br/>\nLooney Tunes movie (which was otherwise fairly free of product placement if<br/>\nyou don&#39;t count Acme) they find a WalMart in the desert. As they leave, they<br/>\nsay &quot;It&#39;s sure nice of WALMART to give us these WALMART beverages in<br/>\nexchange for saying WALMART so many times!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, skip the Cat and go see Bugs. It&#39;s mindless fun, although<br/>\nschool-at-homers might want to review pointillism and Salvador Dali. :) I<br/>\nthink toddlers through adults would enjoy this one!<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17393,"nextTopicId":17413}}
