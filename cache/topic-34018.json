Actually, he was in the den watching t.v. and the kids were <br/>\nin the living room playing.  When I got home, my daughter ran up to <br/>\nme and said, &quot;Mommy!  (Brother) did something naughty! Hurry and <br/>\nsee!&quot;  My first thought was, &quot;Oh, no.  What did he do THIS time?&quot;  <br/>\nWell, my daughter led me to the living room and pointed at the big <br/>\ntrain table we have set up (it&#39;s one of those with the plain white <br/>\nformica type top.  The kids use if for all kinds of toys, but usually <br/>\nNOT for trains!)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son had drawn all over the top and even on the wood sides with a <br/>\npermanent marker!  At first, my usual response began to erupt from my <br/>\nmouth, &quot;Oh, Matthew!&quot; (in a very dismayed voice) and then I noticed <br/>\nwhat I was thinking and how I was about to make my son feel horrible <br/>\nand afraid and guilty.  I stopped for a second and really LOOKED at <br/>\nhis drawings.  They were totally awesome!  He had drawn palm trees <br/>\nthat looked really good and all sorts of ocean type things (he&#39;s into <br/>\nthe Beach Boys and sharks right now).  My son had run away as soon as <br/>\nI began to show the look of horror on my face.  He was hiding around <br/>\nthe corner and peeking to see what I was doing.  I smiled at him and <br/>\nasked him to come tell me about his art work.  He hesitantly came <br/>\nover and then, when he knew I wasn&#39;t going to yell at him, happily <br/>\nbegan explaining what all he had drawn.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter he was all finished telling me, I gently told him that he <br/>\nshould probably talk to me or daddy first before drawing on something <br/>\nthat isn&#39;t paper.  I explained to him that permanent markers usually <br/>\ndon&#39;t come off (I don&#39;t keep permanent markers out, but evidentally, <br/>\nmy daughter had found one with my scrapbooking stuff and had it out <br/>\nwhile I was gone).  All three of us worked at getting the marker off <br/>\n(which was nearly impossible - but finally we found nail polish <br/>\nremover worked).  My son actually had fun cleaning it up and making <br/>\nit disappear.  We never could get his name off the wood side, though!<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I realized that I should have taken a picture of his beautiful <br/>\nart work.  Drats!  As we were cleaning, I thought about what he may <br/>\nhave been thinking.  He may have seen that big expanse of white and, <br/>\nsince he loves to draw, he probably couldn&#39;t resist the urge.  I <br/>\nwondered how I could help him meet his need to have a big area to <br/>\ndraw.  Then I remembered that we have a bunch of colored dry erase <br/>\nmarkers.  I told my son that we would try a little of the dry erase <br/>\nmarkers on the table and see if they would clean up easily.  It <br/>\nworked!  So for the last two days, my son has been drawing an <br/>\nunbelievable mural on the train table using dry erase markers.  It is <br/>\na wonderful scene of shark fins coming out of an ocean.  I&#39;ve been <br/>\ntaking pictures of his progress.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to share that it is getting a little easier to stop <br/>\nsome of the learned, automatic responses I usually have and replace <br/>\nthem with more mindful thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34016,"nextTopicId":34048}}
