Oh and we belong to national email announcement lists <br/>\ntoo:  National Wildlife; NASA; National Geographic; I cannot remember them all - but there <br/>\nis probably something out there for every interest.  Many of these let us in on shows that <br/>\nwill be on TV ahead of time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The internet has made homeschooling/unschooling soooooooooo easy in my opinion - <br/>\nyes we live in a metro area with lots to do so that does help.  But one does have to dig to <br/>\nfind things in Kansas City - I think we often have to dig when it is where we live.  I <br/>\nremember visiting my sister and her family on the Gulf Coast 2 years ago, we stayed for 4 <br/>\nweeks and just explored and ran around and had a great time (we used the internet to find <br/>\nout of the way and unusual places/things to do).  This was the second summer in a row <br/>\nthat we stayed for 4 weeks.  One of my nieces (age 21, who grew up there) asked how we <br/>\nfound that many things to do, to stay busy for 4 weeks.  We went and did things that she <br/>\nnever thought to do - it was just a part of the background/landscape of her everyday life <br/>\nbut we thought it was unique, different and fun.  For example we took a sail boat ride on <br/>\nthe back bays - the year before that we took an eco trip on the back bays - they have <br/>\nlived there for 20 years and have never been on the back bays (and it&#39;s not due to a lack of <br/>\nmoney).  There were parks and walking trails that they had never been on - drove right by <br/>\nfor years.  We do the same thing here in our locale - we have to stop and find these local <br/>\nthings to do.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; More connections and opportunities to get out into the community:  volunteer work<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Zac has always loved to build and construct - Lego&#39;s are still a huge part of his life.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We just started volunteering with Habitat For Humanity last month - building houses!   <br/>\nThey wanted him to be 16 to volunteer (he is 14 today)  but they said OK when we said <br/>\nwe&#39;d be volunteering right along beside him.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ed & Zac also volunteer at a place called Harvesters twice a month - actually this is a <br/>\nwhole homeschool group effort project - age limit is 6 and up.  They sort food (or <br/>\nwhatever they are asked to do).  The food is donated food that gets sorted and then sent <br/>\nout to local/in the neighborhood distributation food banks.  I&#39;m saying &quot;they&quot; because this <br/>\nis a project that is done during the day while I&#39;m at work - so the guys (Ed & Zac) do it <br/>\nwithout me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We don&#39;t do this, but another homeschool family does:  they volunteer at an animal <br/>\nshelter.  They keep kittens until they are old enough to be adopted.  They always have <br/>\nthese fun kittens to play with.  The shelter provides all food, etc.  I know others that go to <br/>\nthe shelter and walk dogs/play with the animals/etc.  We talked about volunteering for the <br/>\n&quot;Husky Rescue Society&quot; as we have huskies ourselves, but decided that we were not at a <br/>\nplace to be able to do that right now - there is just about any breed rescue society out <br/>\nthere that would probably love to have foster dog parent help - I read about a rabbit <br/>\nsociety in the paper so I know there are many of that type of thing out there.  Oh and the <br/>\nlocal zoo might take volunteers, as well as the local wild animal places - we have a place <br/>\ncalled Lake Side Nature Center that does rescue work for the local native wildlife - this <br/>\nspring we&#39;ve taken an injured bat and a one footed injured pigeon there for help.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We hatched chicken eggs for a friend - we incubated them for 21 days and then kept <br/>\nthe chicks for 2 weeks before returning them to the &quot;owner&quot;.  This was something I <br/>\nvolunteered to do and wanted to do, but Zac certainly got involved of his own free will.  <br/>\nWe&#39;ve done this several times over the years.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lisa W.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":341636512,"authorName":"healthunlimited1","from":"&quot;healthunlimited1&quot; &lt;shileennixon@...&gt;","profile":"healthunlimited1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Strewing for teenagers ....","postDate":"1214231401","msgId":35659,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGczb2MxOStzc3BnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEVCRjFDN0ZFLTA0MTAtNEZDOC04N0FELTIwMDhGQzdGNTZCQ0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":35658,"nextInTopic":35660,"prevInTime":35658,"nextInTime":35660,"topicId":35623,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Gosh... after all of these responses (thank you very much!) maybe we aren t as far off as I thought.

We do a lot of the things that were shared ... from sharing tv shows and movies <br/>\nto calling for each other when one of us sees something cool.  That just happened 5 <br/>\nminutes ago.  My husband loves bugs/insects - he&#39;s a biology major (never used it <br/>\nthough).  He spotted a very unusual moth and called us all out to look at it.  He&#39;ll often <br/>\ngive us some kind of lesson.  I often spend time in the living room with my laptop or a <br/>\nbook while ds is on WoW just to hang with each other.  Occasionally, if I&#39;m in the family <br/>\nroom, he&#39;ll ask me to join him to keep him company.  He does the You Tube thing <br/>\nsearching for all kinds of stuff.  Half the time I&#39;m unaware.  He likes funny things like crazy <br/>\nthings cats do.  We enjoy sharing our house and will have different youth meetings and <br/>\noccasionally over night guests.  We just had someone in from Serbia and next month we <br/>\nhave some people coming from Holland.  But ... at the same time he&#39;s a typical teenager (I <br/>\nguess typical) wanting to stay home to do his WoW routine (play the game, take a break <br/>\nplay his drums, play the game, take a break workout all while watching tv) or hang out <br/>\nwith his friends which most of them play WoW.  Although today he&#39;s getting together with <br/>\na friend who is a few years older than he is to put flyers around neighborhoods as they&#39;re <br/>\nstarting a grass cutting business.  I do try to be aware of his interests as some of you have <br/>\ndescribed.  I guess I&#39;m feeling like maybe I&#39;d like to step it up a notch.  We really don&#39;t &quot;go&quot; <br/>\nand do much that way.  I&#39;m thinking that we need to provide new and interesting <br/>\nopportunities for ds at least from time to time to enrich his life.  As I mentioned in my <br/>\noriginal post that DH and I tend to get stuck in the grind of life.  DH is happy with that ... I <br/>\nam not.

We belong to a local announcement","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1370408009\">By being alert to conversations around us we pick up on opportunities - or something gives us an idea to follow-up with.  We belong to a local announcement list that people/homeschoolers post things that are going on in the community to do - no chat allowed on the list, just announcements for things to do.  We also join local email announcement lists such as the zoo, our county, local nature parks, parks and recreation, museums, etc.  they put out what they are doing and what is available in the community - some of it is free stuff going on.  Oh and we belong to national email announcement lists too:  National Wildlife; NASA; National Geographic; I cannot remember them all - but there is probably something out there for every interest.  Many of these let us in on shows that will be on TV ahead of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe internet has made homeschooling/unschooling soooooooooo easy in my opinion - yes we live in a metro area with lots to do so that does help.  But one does have to dig to find things in Kansas City - I think we often have to dig when it is where we live.  I remember visiting my sister and her family on the Gulf Coast 2 years ago, we stayed for 4 weeks and just explored and ran around and had a great time (we used the internet to find out of the way and unusual places/things to do).  This was the second summer in a row that we stayed for 4 weeks.  One of my nieces (age 21, who grew up there) asked how we found that many things to do, to stay busy for 4 weeks.  We went and did things that she never thought to do - it was just a part of the background/landscape of her everyday life but we thought it was unique, different and fun.  For example we took a sail boat ride on the back bays - the year before that we took an eco trip on the back bays - they have lived there for 20 years and have never been on the back bays (and it&#39;s not due to a lack of money).  There were parks and walking trails that they had never been on - drove right by for years.  We do the same thing here in our locale - we have to stop and find these local things to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMore connections and opportunities to get out into the community:  volunteer work<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nZac has always loved to build and construct - Lego&#39;s are still a huge part of his life.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWe just started volunteering with Habitat For Humanity last month - building houses!   They wanted him to be 16 to volunteer (he is 14 today)  but they said OK when we said we&#39;d be volunteering right along beside him.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEd & Zac also volunteer at a place called Harvesters twice a month - actually this is a whole homeschool group effort project - age limit is 6 and up.  They sort food (or whatever they are asked to do).  The food is donated food that gets sorted and then sent out to local/in the neighborhood distributation food banks.  I&#39;m saying &quot;they&quot; because this is a project that is done during the day while I&#39;m at work - so the guys (Ed & Zac) do it without me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t do this, but another homeschool family does:  they volunteer at an animal shelter.  They keep kittens until they are old enough to be adopted.  They always have these fun kittens to play with.  The shelter provides all food, etc.  I know others that go to the shelter and walk dogs/play with the animals/etc.  We talked about volunteering for the &quot;Husky Rescue Society&quot; as we have huskies ourselves, but decided that we were not at a place to be able to do that right now - there is just about any breed rescue society out there that would probably love to have foster dog parent help - I read about a rabbit society in the paper so I know there are many of that type of thing out there.  Oh and the local zoo might take volunteers, as well as the local wild animal places - we have a place called Lake Side Nature Center that does rescue work for the local native wildlife - this spring we&#39;ve taken an injured bat and a one footed injured pigeon there for help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe hatched chicken eggs for a friend - we incubated them for 21 days and then kept the chicks for 2 weeks before returning them to the &quot;owner&quot;.  This was something I volunteered to do and wanted to do, but Zac certainly got involved of his own free will.  We&#39;ve done this several times over the years.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":143043046,"authorName":"Ed Wendell","from":"&quot;Ed Wendell&quot; &lt;ewendell@...&gt;","profile":"zelco123","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Strewing for teenagers ....","postDate":"1214225484","msgId":35657,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY5MTY3NzY1RTE4QjQwMkE4RjI0MzkxQUJEMEM4QjkzQEVkUEM+","inReplyToHeader":"PDE2RUEzRTY2LTI4MTQtNEU2Qi1CMDJBLTFDMkQ4QjUyQUY3MUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGczbG9sMCtzbW90QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8N0Y0MjQzQzA2OEYzNEM1QzlBNDNCREE4MzBEQjZFRTRARWRQQz4gPDJDOUFFMzgwLUU1MDEtNDE4NS04NTUzLTRDQTY5QzAxMjUxQUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDE2RUEzRTY2LTI4MTQtNEU2Qi1CMDJBLTFDMkQ4QjUyQUY3MUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":35656,"nextInTopic":35658,"prevInTime":35656,"nextInTime":35658,"topicId":35623,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"THANK YOU !!!!!!

Or I may toss a koosh ball at him just to connect.  OR when I go to get something from the kitchen I&#39;ll ask him if he needs or wants anything to eat or drink.

Zac said he was not interested when we were at the rental store - but when Ed & I sat down to watch it, Zac said, &quot;If you wait until I finish my game I&#39;ll watch it with you.&quot; and he did - which led to links about the old west, bandits, Hole In the Wall, geographic locations, history of people and places, hidden treasures, etc.  We ended up on the computer looking up more information.  Which then led to links about hiking in these areas and hiking safety, etc.  Zac finally wandered off.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\ncomputer games and games for his game consoles - some are rented and some are purchased.  Sometimes this involves simply stepping out of the way - for instance if he is into a computer game for several days we give full access to the computer.<br/>\n<br/>\nkeeping our eyes open for things in the community that would be of interest.  For example we know he loves anything to do with history and particularly war history - so we went to a large civil war battle reenactment - talked about it for a month before hand which led to all sorts of connections;      we go to the local Renaissance fair every year;      driving down the highway we see a small military museum with lots of &quot;equipment&quot; in the yard - we stopped and visited with the people running it - all veterans; <br/>\n<br/>\nWe found out about a &quot;science class&quot; more like science exploration led by an adult - at a really neat science store - he goes once a month to that - dad goes with him.  The store is as much fun and as interesting as the class ;)  it is full of rocks/minerals/ telescopes/ etc. all things that our son is passionate about.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe found a &quot;chain maille&quot; making class that he went to several times this past winter (as long as the people were doing them).<br/>\n<br/>\nhe got into making full sized wooden (replica) swords last year, so we facilitated with trips to the lumber yard; hardware store and fabric store; <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile driving, Ed will ask: do we want to take the fast way home or a different route?  We took a different route the other day - we saw what looked to be an old but elegant apartment building set back on a beautiful, park like lawn.  We made comments about it and wondered about it.  We got home and looked it up and there was the history of the place, a condo for sale (2.5 Million) with a maintenance fee of $3000.00 a month, which led to a discussion of our income/lifestyle in comparison, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe set up an ant farm in the main living area for a while; we have several pets; We have a hamster that is so lively and entertainning that we put her on the kitchen pennsulia where we see her antics all the time (VS in a bedroom where we would not see her much).  This gives us common connections (oh my gosh come see what Camille is doing);  We have bird feeders in our yard and huge windows where we can see out with a bird identifing book lying about; <br/>\n<br/>\nZac is into late seventies (classic and hard rock) music which leads to a lot of You Tube exlploring and down loading music onto his mp3 player - sometimes You Tube is great for clicking and clicking and clicking - the connections that lead every where.  For example Zac loves Star Wars, he was exploring Star Wars on You Tube the other day and came across a guy playing a Star Wars theme song on Bag Pipes (Zac loves bagpipe music and has a good friend that plays pipes & drums in a piping band) so that led to listening to bagpipe champions play some really rocking music!!! He started off looking for Star Wars stuff and ended up exploring Bag Pipe music.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Zac, books are for looking at and exploring - mostly small amounts of reading with lots of pictures w/captions.  He loves loves loves Manga books from Japan and Anime.  I cannot seem to pick those correctly though - I bought a whole set of 25 books on eBay for Christmas and he refuses to read them - sys he is not interested in that series - lesson learned for me is: let him pick the series.<br/>\n<br/>\nAround here there is a lot of:  Hey Zac you should come see this - or - hey mom/dad you should come see this - it could be a bird, spider web, dogs doing something cute/funny/crazy; something on the computer; last night it was the really neat moon as we were driving home (hey look at the really neat moon that is out tonight.)  OR a movie/film/TV show that we would like to share with someone.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep your eyes and ears open for anything and everything that might be of an interest to your son as well as the family and keep providing opportunities.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":341636512,"authorName":"healthunlimited1","from":"&quot;healthunlimited1&quot; &lt;shileennixon@...&gt;","profile":"healthunlimited1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Strewing for teenagers ....","postDate":"1214146016","msgId":35623,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGczbG9sMCtzbW90QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":35627,"prevInTime":35622,"nextInTime":35624,"topicId":35623,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am very interested in hearing how some of you practice strewing for your older children - teenagers to be more specific.
