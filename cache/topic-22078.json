I was thinking of the way<br/>\nyoung people in our culture have their blossoming<br/>\nindependence and maturity squashed and stifled at a<br/>\ncritical time as young adults when they should be<br/>\nmaking that leap from childhood to adulthood.  We<br/>\nstand in their way with laws (applying to &quot;minors&quot;<br/>\nunder a sweepingly general age) as well as (and<br/>\nperhaps more importantly) with the general familial<br/>\nand cultural message at every turn that they are<br/>\nstupid, irresponsible, incapable children until the<br/>\nsudden magic morning of their 18th birthday.  For some<br/>\nfamilies even that age milestone is not enough, and<br/>\nthe continue to hold thier young adult offspring under<br/>\ntheir thumbs until well into their 20s or beyond. <br/>\nJust to clarify, I am not talking about kicking &quot;kids&quot;<br/>\nout at 18 or telling them when to &quot;mature&quot; but rather<br/>\nabout not getting in their way when they are doing it<br/>\nthemselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn light of how other list members were thinking of<br/>\nthis &quot;extended childhood concept&quot; in a somewhat<br/>\nopposite way to what I was, that our kids are not<br/>\nALLOWED to be children at a young age (which I also<br/>\nbelieve) and thus they are unable to progress into<br/>\nmaturity when the time comes, it&#39;s got me considering<br/>\nhow those factors collide.  We have an interesting<br/>\nparadox in our culture where children are expected to<br/>\nact like miniature adults while not extended any of<br/>\nthe courtesies, respect or independence that comes<br/>\nwith that status.  The results, I feel, are often<br/>\ntwisted and broken adults who don&#39;t know who or what<br/>\nthey are or where they belong and have little or no<br/>\nconfidence in their own abilities or decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a radical unschooler, how do I best avoid such<br/>\npitfalls both early in childhood and in young<br/>\nadulthood, or how do I mitigate and repair damages<br/>\ndone by this set of circumstances?  Of course I have<br/>\nmy own ideas and approaches but I am interested in<br/>\nwhat others have to say about this topic also. <br/>\nThoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":116488337,"authorName":"Gold Standard","from":"&quot;Gold Standard&quot; &lt;jacki@...&gt;","profile":"jackiknouse","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Artificial Extension of Childhood","postDate":"1114826693","msgId":22094,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHT0VKREREQUEuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUwNDMwMDExMC5qM1UxQXM1RDAxNDUzM0Bhc3VyYS5jbGVhcmxpZ2h0LmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":22092,"nextInTopic":22095,"prevInTime":22093,"nextInTime":22095,"topicId":22078,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"lol! ...
