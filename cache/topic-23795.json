(La Leche League  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t run such things, but that&#39;s where the group of us had met.)    <br/>\nThen I signed up for *Prodigy, which got you e-mail and access to  <br/>\nbulletin boards (BBs), which were not nearly as spiffy as message  <br/>\nboards, but vaguely like that.  It was like all one big list, and  <br/>\npeople could respond, but you had to go to that site to read it.  The  <br/>\nhomeschooling list we could get to was a mixture of all kinds of  <br/>\nhomeschoolers, but most of them were big into structure, and some of  <br/>\nthem had no idea WHY (or that) anyone would homeschool who hadn&#39;t  <br/>\nbeen directed to do so at church or by her husband.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I moved to AOL, where there were several ways to communicate.   <br/>\nThere were message boards, and chatrooms.  I used to do a two  hour  <br/>\nscheduled topic chat every week, and then edit the text of them down  <br/>\ninto a readable (long) thing people could download and read later.   <br/>\nAnd I put out a newsletter--two of them, but not at the same time  <br/>\n(one led to the other), with a mailing list I kept on the computer,  <br/>\nand updated from e-mails people sent me (and &quot;unsubscribed&quot; people by  <br/>\nsearch and delete on a word file with over 2000 names at one point).   <br/>\nI could only send 200 at a time, so I learned some good file  <br/>\nmanagement and e-mail tricks.  It was a lot of work, but I was happy  <br/>\ndoing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrowing Without Schooling came out every other month or so.  It was  <br/>\nlagging and petering out.   Waiting two months for a magazine  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t   any good as a primary source of support and daily  <br/>\nencouragement.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was not a better source for quick, thorough homeschooling  <br/>\ninformation in those days than the AOL forum.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen AOL got very squirrelly and replaced all the homeschool-mom  <br/>\nvolunteers (who were getting free AOL in exchange for working in  <br/>\nthere, maybe 12 or 15 people at a time) with people who weren&#39;t even  <br/>\nhomeschoolers.  It wasn&#39;t fun anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nHome Education Magazine set up unschooling.com as a place for the  <br/>\nunschoolers to go, and the HEM forum (larger, magazine-focussed) for  <br/>\nall the rest, and from that came the unschooling.com list, which went  <br/>\nthrough a couple of name changes and was passed on to me, Pam  <br/>\nSorooshian and Joyce Fetteroll a couple (or three?) years ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy then, though, people could have webpages, and there were lots more  <br/>\nhomeschoolers, lots more unschoolers,<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has been ten years since anyone had to rely on books or magazines  <br/>\nas their information on homeschooling.  Those who have chosen to have  <br/>\ninternet in their homes have more than they could possibly read, and  <br/>\nthey have to pick and choose.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to both small pools of people/ <br/>\ninfo and of large.   We can&#39;t change it either way.  Life keeps  <br/>\nflowing along.  I miss having Kelly Lovejoy and Ren Allen on  <br/>\ndiscussions &lt;g&gt; but they&#39;re doing a great thing by having a  <br/>\nbeginners&#39; list where they&#39;ll answer the same questions really  <br/>\npatiently.  I myself prefer the in-depth examination of why people  <br/>\nhave a hard time shaking some of their beliefs, and about how culture  <br/>\nwith its questionable &quot;truths&quot; and its platitudes cripples people&#39;s  <br/>\nthinking sometimes.   Some people hate those kinds of discussions,  <br/>\nabout the nature of reality and what &quot;learn&quot; means.  Some people have  <br/>\nsaid they&#39;d scream if another person asked them &quot;How will they learn  <br/>\nto read if you don&#39;t teach them?&quot;  (Some have screamed. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nNobody has to stay on any list forever, either.  There can be ebb and  <br/>\nflow of lists and participants, of topics and moods.   They&#39;re all  <br/>\npart of one fine face. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"One big list..correction","postDate":"1136480891","msgId":23795,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRwampwcitxc2VuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":23796,"prevInTime":23794,"nextInTime":23796,"topicId":23795,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m wrong....Anne wasn t here.
