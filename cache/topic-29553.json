The Who&#39;s &quot;Baba O&#39;Reilly&quot; came on the radio and Ross said &quot;this is one of my all-time favorite song-beginnings.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle asked what the instrument was (Moog synthesizer, maybe?) and then Ross says &quot;Guess who sings this?&quot; Michelle answered &quot;Who?&quot; and Ross said &quot;Yes!&quot; which led to the back and forth &quot;Who?&quot; &quot;Yes!&quot; for a bit. Then, dd *got* it. They proceeded to talk about other names and dd figured out a comedy routine of rock groups:  &quot;Guess Who? Who? Yes! Them!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I got back into the car (and after all this was related), we started trying to think of names we could categorize:<br/>\n <br/>\nAnimal names: Beatles, Eagles, Byrds, Crazy Horse, Monkees, Turtles, Cat Stevens <br/>\n(singing I Love My Dog), Doug & the Slugs (local to Vancouver, B.C. ) <br/>\n<br/>\nWeird and interesting names: !!! (pronounced chk, chk, chk like the <br/>\ntongue-clicking of African bushmen), Smashmouth, Smashing Pumpkins, Golden <br/>\nEarring, Canned Heat, The Killers, The Shins, The Smiths, Maroon 5, The Troggs, Simon and Garfunkel, R.E.M., Gary Puckett and the Union Gap &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPlace names: Chicago, Boston, New York Dolls, John Denver <br/>\n<br/>\nWestern themed: Blue Rodeo, Cowboy Junkies, Crazy Horse (again), John Denver <br/>\n(again) <br/>\n<br/>\nCar themed: Cars, Bachman Turner Overdrive, Booker T and the MG&#39;s<br/>\n<br/>\nWe know there are way more, but couldn&#39;t think of all of them right then.  Additions welcomed!<br/>\n<br/>\nDd thought the absolute funniest name was The Doors. She was thinking of a bunch of dog doors/glass doors/screen doors/front doors/back doors and wondering how the heck they came up with that!   She chuckled about that all night.  It never occurred to me - all I think of is Jim Morrison and he&#39;s doesn&#39;t seem so funny to me...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then we talked about misheard lyrics. My favorites are &quot;Slow motion Walter, fire engine guy&quot; and &quot;&#39;Scuse me will I kiss this guy&quot;, not to mention the unitelligible lyrics of &quot;Jumping Jack Flash&quot; (as Whoopi Goldberg wished aloud in the movie &quot;Mick, Mick, speak English&quot;).  <br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle said she liked &quot;Stop the cat box/lock the cash box&quot; (she&#39;d seen an ad on tv with guys discussing the lyrics).  That lead to a search online when we got home for misheard lyrics.  She couldn&#39;t believe how many misheard versions of one song existed (and how many songs were on the site).
