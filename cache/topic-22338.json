But in terms of <br/>\n&quot;training,&quot; if a kid has too much stuff you can&#39;t bribe and threaten, so <br/>\nyou&#39;ve spoiled the ability to control his behavior with the promise of <br/>\nfood, privilege or material goods.**<br/>\n<br/>\nAh!  This is a new thought for me.  Cool!<br/>\n<br/>\n**Honestly, a lot of the &quot;truths&quot; of conditioning and training and learning  <br/>\ncome from lab-rat &quot;proofs.&quot;  I hadn&#39;t thought of that for years and  years.  We <br/>\n&quot;proved&quot; things with really hungry rats and people applied the  principles to <br/>\nhuman children who didn&#39;t live in cages.<br/>\n <br/>\nAll that operant conditioning is out of style now in psych studies.  I  think <br/>\nthe effects remain in schools.**<br/>\n<br/>\nYes!  A lot of &quot;educational&quot; practices rest on some shaky and OLD research.  Alfie Kohn (in Punished by Rewards) disses B. F. Skinner pretty strongly.  Most unschooling parents will enjoy his point of view, I think.  (He seems to let go of conventional thinking about learning and talk almost only from observations about learning taking place.  I think he&#39;s cool.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been known to try to win arguments on education methodology by saying &quot;Kids are smarter than lab rats&quot; when someone suggests that kids should be trained with rat pellet methods.   Maybe a few steps back in the conversation I would have tried to say &quot;These theories were tested on pigeons and lab rats...&quot;   (Those quotes make more sense in the reverse order, sorry.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":132859234,"authorName":"Paula Sjogerman","from":"Paula Sjogerman &lt;sjogy@...&gt;","profile":"psjogy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] carts before pizzas (was Summer reading\tprogram)","postDate":"1118687758","msgId":22380,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJFRDMzQzNFLkYyQzQlc2pvZ3lAc2JjZ2xvYmFsLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDFjMi4yYTc0YmU1YS4yZmRkYmUzN0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":22338,"nextInTopic":22381,"prevInTime":22379,"nextInTime":22381,"topicId":22338,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
