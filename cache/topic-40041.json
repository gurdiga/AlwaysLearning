If you don&#39;t want pizza, why ask all about ingredients  <br/>\nand toppings and prices and comparisons?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not their job to answer questions of anyone who wanders by and  <br/>\nplainly states no interest?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here&#39;s the deal:  Asking IS showing an interest,  so these  <br/>\nstatement are either contradictory, or this is creepy stalking:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Honestly, unschooling is NOT for me and my family for many  <br/>\nreasons. -=-<br/>\n-=-I didn&#39;t realize I was asking either of you for help.  I am doing  <br/>\njust fine in my &quot;mainstream&quot; world. -=-<br/>\n-=- I find that any lifestyle lived in one end of the spectrum or  <br/>\nanother can be thwarting to some degree.  What disturbs me is the  <br/>\nattitude of superiority that the Unschooling Community seems to  <br/>\nhold.  There could be some useful techniques or tips from your  <br/>\nlifestyle I could use in my life, however, I will never know since no  <br/>\none will answer some basic questions. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving written to another unschooler eighteen months back, that shows  <br/>\nan interest.  Not having gotten over it, and writing more (lengthily,  <br/>\nto me, on a Sunday) about something that is CLEARLY available (&quot; I  <br/>\nhad taken time to browse some sites (including yours) before emailing  <br/>\nyou.&quot;), what could be the deal?  Harrassment?  An awkward request to  <br/>\nbe persuaded?  Unhealthy obsession?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s Sunday.  Shouldn&#39;t people be spending time with their kids?   <br/>\nMine aren&#39;t even young, but this mom&#39;s kids are both younger.   <br/>\nSURELY, certainly, hanging out with them should win out over bugging  <br/>\nme.  So it&#39;s not true that there&#39;s no interest.  There&#39;s a deep,  <br/>\nabiding, disturbing interest.<br/>\n<br/>\n[And so far today I was on the phone with Kirby for half an hour  <br/>\n(he&#39;s 22), talked to Marty and helped him get ready for his half-day  <br/>\nin Santa Fe, and he&#39;s going to go with me to dinner tonight (I didn&#39;t  <br/>\nknow that when he left, but it&#39;s cool) and I took Holly to rendezvous  <br/>\nwith the other airsoft players, and then went to get gifts for her  <br/>\nbirthday-celebrating friend.  We&#39;ll probably miss Desperate  <br/>\nHousewives, what we usually do on Sunday  night while we sort  <br/>\nlaundry.  We&#39;ll watch it online tomorrow or Tuesday.  Lily Tomlin  <br/>\nwill be on (and was briefly last week), so I found her a couple of  <br/>\nold Lily Tomlin bits on YouTube the other day.]<br/>\n<br/>\nAh.

I think she wants to  <br/>\ncorrespond with people she considers prominent, who have been on TV  <br/>\nor have websites.
