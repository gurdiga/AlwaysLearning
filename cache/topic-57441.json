I woke up and could not get out of bed.<br/>\nI was alone with my almost 4 year old son and felt helpless. Logan&#39;s first reaction was that he wanted to take care of me. He went downstairs and opened the refrigerator by himself, something he had not done before, and brought me food.<br/>\nHe was very proud of himself for taking care of mommy. It could have been a rough day, but he rose to the occasion. My friend came over to bring me Dramamine, she helped him with breakfast, and the potty, he was a gem.  Then my dad came over to play with Logan so I could rest. On a normal day, he would have wanted me there, but he happily played with grandpa.<br/>\nIt was wonderful to see his compassion, and I know he learned this from me and his dad, because make meeting his needs a priority.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeryl<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;joanne.lopers&quot; &lt;wilmalv@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There was a conversation posted recently by Alex reguading meeting the needs of a two year old that struck a cord with me.
