To connect with<br/>\n our families and engage in our communities.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I stick my nose in a book to escape and relax then I isolate myself.  If I dig in my flower garden by myself then I isolate myself - well someone might join me in the endeavor or they might not.  But if I made him turn the TV off and help with the garden & he griped and complained to the point of ruining the relaxation for me - what good would that do???   Usually he will come dig with me a bit and it is true connecting then.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I choose to join my son on the couch and we watch a show together then we are discussing and connecting with each other;  socializing & laughing together.  My son is a talker and discusser - in fact sometimes I have to ask him to wait until the show is at a commercial to talk or we&#39;ll miss something.  This is why we like DVD&#39;s - we can pause it to discuss while we are &quot;in the moment&quot; and that thought is in our heads.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow oh how is relaxing with a book; sitting on the deck soaking up the new spring air, reading emails, reading on the net, reading the news paper, or anything else I do to relax, any different than watching TV ?????  Each one could be described as time wasters if you wanted to pick it apart and look for the negative -<br/>\n<br/>\nI really never watch TV on my own - but I do watch to purposefully connect with my son - same goes for movies.  I really do love to read more than watch.  But my son &quot;learns&quot; best with visual input and really enjoys the TV being on.  Most discussions that happen in our home happen BECAUSE of something he/we have seen on TV or in a film of some type.  My son knows more about world history than most schooled people because of TV and film format.  Well I could say he knows more than most schooled people because of TV and film format.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe/we watch everything from The History Channel, The Military Channel, nature programs, forensic investigation, to Looney Tunes cartoons and America&#39;s Funniest Video&#39;s reruns.  Oh and he loves, Who&#39;s Line Is It Anyway and old MASH reruns. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we first pulled him from school mid-third grade (age 8.5) we were worried that all he wanted to do was watch TV - we had glorious visions of him being outside or actively doing things - but he had the TV on all day no matter what we suggested.  We didn&#39;t know about &quot;de-schooling&quot; at the time.  If we got him out of the house to do something he would literally run in the house and turn on the TV when we returned home.  Or worry about a program we was missing.  So we decided we would limit not what he watched but how much.  He could watch until noon and then again in the evening - TV off every afternoon. He immediately began to negotiate with us - he&#39;s always been a great negotiator ;)  -  trading certain times in the morning for afternoon times because there was something on in the afternoon he wanted to see.  It became a huge time consumption to keep track of what he wanted to watch when, and what time he had available - in other words we soon realized it wasted more time worrying about how much and when than to just let go.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is getting long but I wanted to ad that Zachariah is his most creative when the TV is on.  He is also very active. TV has inspired some awesome Lego creations for example.  Or he might see something that inspires him to go outside and do something similar.  Archery or target shooting with his BB gun comes to mind or digging a fox hole for days on end in the back yard when he was younger.  Anime shows have led to his love of reading graphic novels (specifically Japanese Manga)<br/>\n<br/>\nAll said:   TV is often the inspiration / catalyst for him to think, read, create, and do. To connect with his family and engage in his community.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: national turnoff tv week, april 21- 27","postDate":"1208518586","msgId":34362,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZ1YTEzcSs1dm4xQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNFRjlBQzhBLUY5RjQtNEYyRC1CMzRDLTZCMzhDMTFGQThGQkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":34355,"nextInTopic":34365,"prevInTime":34361,"nextInTime":34363,"topicId":34345,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~ Turning off the television gives us a chance to think, read, create, and do.

I don&#39;t know what guilt they carried for fudging the rules, but I know it didn&#39;t give them a happy and good relationship either with television or with their religion. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Tammy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jjandtammy@...\">jjandtammy@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Wednesday, 16 April, 2008 10:06:46 PM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] national turnoff tv week, april 21- 27<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Turnoff TV Week<br/>\nTurnoff Week 2008 April 21th - 27th<br/>\n<br/>\nan interesting challenge!<br/>\n<br/>\nTurning off the television gives us a chance to think, read, create, and do.

And next week we should all do &quot;Don&#39;t read a book  <br/>\nweek&quot; so we can watch, create and do.

How about &quot;No socializing week&quot;? I mean, really, unless your  <br/>\ndiscussing something enlightening, what use is it? So unless you have  <br/>\nsomething weighty or educational to discuss, don&#39;t spend time  <br/>\nchatting with people for a whole week. Imagine all the engaging  <br/>\ndiscussions people will have all week! And all the more creative and  <br/>\nuseful things they can do with that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd &quot;No computers week&quot;. Let&#39;s shut the lists down. Everyone turn off  <br/>\nthe computers. Go use the library. Write a real letter by hand. Look  <br/>\nup words in the dictionary. Because all of those are impossible  <br/>\nchoices with computers. It&#39;s evil computers fault that we don&#39;t do  <br/>\nany of that. Demons. Controlling evil spirits.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; an interesting challenge!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A far more interesting challenge might be to get people to think  <br/>\nabout why they watch TV rather than to treat it as some drug they  <br/>\nneed to the kick the habit of.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would bet good money that most people who feel the TV controls  <br/>\ntheir lives are people who work or go to school and use TV to relax  <br/>\nor had TV controlled or limited as children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI watched a lot of TV as a kid. As soon as I came home from school,  <br/>\nall the schlocky (now classic!) shows (Love Boat and Lost in Space  <br/>\nand Charlie&#39;s Angels ...), Saturdays cartoons, Saturday matinee,  <br/>\nChiller Theater on Saturday night. I even remember watching bowling.  <br/>\nFortunately my parents were happiest when I was engaged and I got  <br/>\ngood grades. As far as I know they didn&#39;t give much thought  to my TV  <br/>\nwatching. I think they just didn&#39;t want to mess up what was working! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I worked my husband and I  often watched rerun TV with dinner  <br/>\nand the shows after. It was a way to relax.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs much as I love TV, I just don&#39;t find as much time to watch it now.  <br/>\nThere&#39;s way too much to do. We do watch a show or movie with dinner.  <br/>\nAnd despite that, we&#39;re a close family. No, actually, because of  <br/>\nthat. Okay, it&#39;s not the single factor that will connect any  <br/>\nfamily ;-) but it&#39;s a shared history we have. We often make TV and  <br/>\nmovie references in our lives. We talk about the shows and the  <br/>\ncharacters. We anticipate the return of House together! We even do  <br/>\nother things too that aren&#39;t TV related ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nTV is another thing in our lives like the cabinet of games, and  <br/>\nGuitar Hero, and way too many books. It&#39;s not evil. It&#39;s not  <br/>\ncontrolling. It&#39;s something fun to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nRanting about the evil TV belief is one of my favorite activities ;-)  <br/>\nand I&#39;ve collected lots of them at:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joyfullyrejoycing.com\">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n(Obviously I not only watch TV but find time to be inspired by it ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra has a lot of writings collected too:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/tv\">http://sandradodd.com/tv</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":170430677,"authorName":"Tammy","from":"&quot;Tammy&quot; &lt;jjandtammy@...&gt;","profile":"kidsarewild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"national turnoff tv week, april 21- 27","postDate":"1208380006","msgId":34345,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZ1NXBwNitkcnZlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":34346,"prevInTime":34344,"nextInTime":34346,"topicId":34345,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"National Turnoff TV Week Turnoff Week 2008 April 21th - 27th an interesting challenge!
