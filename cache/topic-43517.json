I joined UD at the end of 2000 and our first conference was<br/>\nthe second Live and Learn a couple of years later.  We were already<br/>\nliving what I describe in my book by 2000. Not that I haven&#39;t learned<br/>\nfrom email lists and conferences - I have and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll continue to<br/>\n- but the larger portion of my understanding of living an unschooled<br/>\nlife came from interacting with and learning from my children and from<br/>\nmy own just-about-lifelong fascination with how and why people learn and<br/>\nhow children are viewed and treated. What was great for us about finding<br/>\nUD, RUL, unschooling.com, the conferences, and John Holt was that we<br/>\nrealized we were not alone in how we saw things, where before we had<br/>\nbeen feeling so.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy mom is a special education &#39;expert&#39; who is well-known in her field.<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been talking about and (pleasantly) arguing about learning for<br/>\nmuch of my life.  I like to tell her she has only herself to blame that<br/>\nmy kids don&#39;t go to school, since she&#39;s the one who first recommended<br/>\nbooks for me to read about brain development and learning and childhood,<br/>\nwhich led me to think about those things all the more.  We were just<br/>\ntalking on Sunday about how I remember feeling while I was in school<br/>\nthat life had to be bigger than that.  She didn&#39;t argue with that :o).<br/>\n <br/>\nI can barely remember a time I wasn&#39;t questioning and thinking about<br/>\nparenting practices. I came from a large family and became an aunt for<br/>\nthe first time when I was 9 years old. We all lived together on one<br/>\nproperty for years. Something about being a kid myself but being given<br/>\n&#39;adult&#39; power (I was often left &#39;in charge&#39; of the kids and was<br/>\ninstructed that I could slap their hands as punishment) really affected<br/>\nme, as did seeing that my siblings were in essence making up the rules<br/>\nas they went along.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThen I met Jon.  We were teenagers, and we talked a lot about what sort<br/>\nof family we would want - what sort of relationships between parents and<br/>\nchildren? What accepted wisdom seemed like nonsense? What parts of our<br/>\nchildhoods did we like? What didn&#39;t we like?  Not too far from childhood<br/>\nourselves, we could easily remember what felt right for us and what<br/>\ndidn&#39;t - what felt respectful of us as whole humans and what didn&#39;t -<br/>\nand we determined that we would not forget those things, but in the end<br/>\nwhat has always mattered most to us is what feels respectful to Dagny<br/>\nand Rowan. <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; It&#39;s a good book, but they&#39;re not Rue&#39;s own personal revelations.<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>**For me it is very much a record of my own personal revelations.<br/>\nRevelations about the relationships in my family, revelations about our<br/>\nplace in society as a family, as children, as adults, revelations about<br/>\nlearning from each other and from our lives how our relationships can<br/>\nbest grow and flourish, revelations about my kids and myself, and<br/>\nrevelations about how and why the way we choose to live as a family<br/>\nworks for us, what it means to us, and how I think it translates on a<br/>\nlarger scale to how other families can live happy lives together. <br/>\n <br/>\nOthers had revelations about natural learning and respectful parenting<br/>\nbefore I even had kids, of course, and I&#39;m hopeful that in the history<br/>\nof the world John Holt wasn&#39;t the first and none of us reading and<br/>\nwriting here will be the last. <br/>\n <br/>\n~Rue<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: New to this group and unschooling","postDate":"1238455771","msgId":43585,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFEN0EwQUJCLTM0NEQtNEQ1Mi1COUE1LTJFMDBBNEQxMUUyRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDcyMDQ4NC4yMTQyNi5xbUB3ZWIxMTE0MDIubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDcyMDQ4NC4yMTQyNi5xbUB3ZWIxMTE0MDIubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43583,"nextInTopic":43593,"prevInTime":43584,"nextInTime":43586,"topicId":43517,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-To also answer the new post by Jen, a great book I just read is Parenting a Free Child: an Unschooled Life by Rue Kream.

My name is Mary and I have been, for 10 years a homeschooler to 3 boys (10, 5 1/2, 19 months) along with my husband Jeff.  I have felt for a few years now that something was just not quite working.  2 1/2 years ago we moved to Costa Rica (which has been fabulous) from CT and experienced an unschooling lifestyle for about 6 months.  Then I reverted back to what society says is important and started to force the actual lessons again.  Since then we have all been getting increasingly more angry and sad.  I recently had my son in a local school which did not work out at all but was a great learning experience of what we really wanted to prioritize.  We pulled him out and have been reading a great un schooling book and have realized that this is the answer we have been looking for.  The motivation that we needed to change is upon us and we have been working really hard to make the changes we feel are important.  We really need the support and guidance of a great group that has been through it.  I imagine it will take a little time and there will be many questions for us to get to where we are headed and that is to be the best parents we can be.  I know we haven&#39;t been lately and that has just broken our hearts.  I am confident that we can make the change we so deperately need.  I look forward to all of your insight and hope you will bear with me as I adjust and ask probably too many questions:)  Thanks for having us!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43620,"nextTopicId":43649}}
