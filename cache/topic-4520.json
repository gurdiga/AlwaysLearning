I know how I want to handle things, but I<br/>\ndon&#39;t always live up to it. I struggled with bulimia and anorexia in my<br/>\nteens and early twenties, although I&#39;m really over it now. I eat what I<br/>\nwant at the time, I don&#39;t worry about calories, and I trust my body to<br/>\ncrave what it needs. And it works... however, I&#39;m 5&#39;8&quot; and about 130<br/>\npounds, so it&#39;s pretty easy for me to talk.  My mom was constantly on a<br/>\ndiet, my sister went on her first diet at 5 and ate nothing but celery<br/>\nand water chestnuts, stuff like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nCacie, OTOH, was a 9 pound baby and has always been big, tall and heavy<br/>\nand solid. My friends tell me she&#39;s not fat, but I have some skewed<br/>\nperceptions and I think she is sometimes. Actually, she was a chubby baby<br/>\nand toddler and 3 yr old, and ever since then she&#39;s gained a bunch of<br/>\nweight and then grown a lot taller, so to me she looks chubby for a<br/>\nwhile, then she grows taller and looks average, then it all repeats. <br/>\n<br/>\nLast Septemeber she apparently gained 20 pounds in a couple of months,<br/>\nand weighed 102 pounds at 4&#39;9&quot;. She was 8... and she looked fat to me,<br/>\nshe had a big belly, and I had a really hard time with it. I really do<br/>\nthink it was mostly her natural growth pattern  again, because she just<br/>\nseemee constantly starving,  but there was also a lot of food around that<br/>\nwe didn&#39;t usually eat, mostly processed snack foods like chips and kudos<br/>\nbars and stuff like that... plus we were all busy and stressed, and so<br/>\nfor whatever reasons, she ate a ton of &quot;junk food&quot; and gained that<br/>\nweight. <br/>\n<br/>\nI had a really hard time with it, probably more than when she was little<br/>\nbecause it&#39;s not cute and chubby anymore, she ws developing physically<br/>\nand it was preteen and chubby. I did start to realize how much I still<br/>\nbought into the ideas that fat was ugly and bad, and fat wasn&#39;t  as good<br/>\nas thin and all that, especially with my own kid. I felt ashamed that she<br/>\nwas fat. I have friends who are overweight, and somehow I don&#39;t feel the<br/>\nsame was about them - I&#39;ve tried to talk them out of going to Weight<br/>\nWatchers, I think because I was afraid they&#39;d develop an eating disorder,<br/>\nnow that I look back on it.... another branch on thsi whole issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n I really struggled with limiting food for Cacie - I wanted to, but I<br/>\nalso knew it was the wrong thing for me to do, I didn&#39;t want to give her<br/>\na complex about what she ate, I didn&#39;t want food to be an issue like<br/>\nthat. I faltered a few times but recovered, basically. I did consciously<br/>\ndo some things, like make sure I was cooking healthy, filling meals that<br/>\nshe liked, and offering to do things with her that were physically active<br/>\n(and she&#39;s always been very physically active, she loves soccer and<br/>\nsoftball and football and stilting and hiking, all of it). They were<br/>\noptional, of course, but they were things she liked and she almost always<br/>\ntook me up on it, and  I felt better, it gave me some fuel against my<br/>\ninner tapes... but I was almsot always clear that it was my issue, my<br/>\nproblem, she was fine, happy, and healthy...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, now Cacie&#39;s grown an inch or two, I think; she looks taller and<br/>\nslimmer again. She&#39;s not constantly hungry... and it&#39;s easier for me, I<br/>\nfeel like I&#39;ve gone through the gauntlet. Maybe next time I&#39;ll be better,<br/>\nI don&#39;t know. <br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
