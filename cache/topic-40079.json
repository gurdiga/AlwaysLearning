If they are late trying to catch a plane and the child is  <br/>\nbusy playing and doesn&#39;t want to go, they would miss their flight, pay  <br/>\nthe penalty, go later, or not go at all, rather than coerce the child.  <br/>\nYes, when it is a matter of life and death safety issues, they say  <br/>\nthat coercion might be necessary (blame the parent for their poor  <br/>\nplanning), but otherwise, the child&#39;s judgment and parent&#39;s judgment  <br/>\nare considered equally valid, ignoring the reality that parents may  <br/>\nhave much more information and more understanding of consequences,  <br/>\nPlus, the parent is expected to be the one to give in when mutually  <br/>\nagreeable solutions can&#39;t be found.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was influenced, for the better, by reading all the discussion about  <br/>\nhow to find mutually agreeable solutions - as I was reading about how  <br/>\nfar people were willing to go to get to that point, I practiced and  <br/>\nlearned, myself, how possible it was to work together, not against  <br/>\neach other.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think, in practice, it goes too far - it ignores the reality that  <br/>\nparents are more knowledgeable and more able to anticipate  <br/>\nconsequences in ways that children cannot.
