Her mom was sitting and filling out her schedule for  <br/>\nher totally, while the roommate was arranging her lotions and  <br/>\nshampoos and underwear.  That seemed to me at the time to be too much  <br/>\nmothering, but probably I was partly just jealous that neither of my  <br/>\nparents knew enough to advise me at all, and had basically left me  <br/>\noff at the curb and waved goodbye.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Kirby took some community college classes I did help him with  <br/>\nhis schedule.  Those schedules are really hard to read, but I did try  <br/>\nto show him what all the little codes meant about what building and  <br/>\nwhat days and hours.  We were trying to work around his work schedule  <br/>\nand karate, too, so it was complicated.  Still... &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSchools have for years said &quot;parents need to be more involved&quot; but as  <br/>\nsoon as a parent does get involved, the teachers and administrators  <br/>\nget defensive and feel crowded.   In the case of charter schools,  <br/>\nlocally, some of them become SO infested with parental input that  <br/>\nthey don&#39;t even last the year.  A friend of mine started last fall at  <br/>\na new charter school being based on some system that had just gone  <br/>\nout of print, so they were kinda winging it, and only two teachers  <br/>\nhad been trained in it (whatever it was, I forget), and by October  <br/>\nparental pressure was turning the school into a Waldorf school.  In  <br/>\nsummer when the school was advertised nobody said &quot;Waldorf,&quot; and by  <br/>\nOctober some kids were pulled out because of disorganization, and by  <br/>\nChristmas anyone who didn&#39;t like Waldorf was gone.  I seriously doubt  <br/>\nthat the school lasted all year.  Another charter school in town here  <br/>\nwas closed in late winter for financial mismanagement.  It&#39;s  <br/>\ninteresting to see even public schools coming apart from within.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":176439663,"authorName":"Kelly Shultz","from":"Kelly Shultz &lt;kashultz@...&gt;","profile":"shultzfamily5","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] summerhill","postDate":"1149569503","msgId":26045,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFBNTk5MUQyLUZBNjAtNEQ5OS04OUQ0LTVDODUwQ0NFRkMwQ0BtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDODU2MjhEMERCMTJGOS05RTQtNTAzQ0BtYmxrLXI0MS5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGU1dXU3NCtjNHJkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MUZBREFBQzItOENEOS00OTMxLUIxRkItQzA5REM2NjEzQ0JGQHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8N0VCMjAzOUEtRjQ0NC00RjJDLTlCMTgtQjVDRTU1N0QyMjA3QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+IDw1MTk1NEYyNS1GQzg3LTRDMjctODNDNS0xQTA5QjZCNzY4NTZAc2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDw4Qzg1NjI4RDBEQjEyRjktOUU0LTUwM0NAbWJsay1yNDEuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":26027,"nextInTopic":26049,"prevInTime":26044,"nextInTime":26046,"topicId":26009,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It <br/>\n  was,<br/>\n  in fact, the very epitome of the kind of liberal progressive school so<br/>\n  frowned upon by education traditionalists such as Chris Woodhead, the <br/>\n  former<br/>\n  schools inspector.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Now, in a new book, its current head, Zoe Neill Redhead, the founder&#39;s<br/>\n  daughter, reveals the school is having to adopt a more disciplinarian <br/>\n  tone<br/>\n  towards its current pupils, who have been so pampered by their parents, <br/>\n  she<br/>\n  says, that they no longer know the boundaries of acceptable behaviour.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;We see the results of parental interference and over-indulgence all the<br/>\n  time,&quot; she says in the book Summerhill and A S Neill, previewed in this<br/>\n  week&#39;s Times Educational Supplement and published by the Open <br/>\n  University.<br/>\n  &quot;In modern society, parents seem to be unable to leave their kids alone <br/>\n  for<br/>\n  more than a short while. At Summerhill, we now see many children who <br/>\n  are in<br/>\n  constant search of adult influence and stimulation, unable to quietly <br/>\n  get<br/>\n  along with their own lives without the need for admiration and <br/>\n  attention.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  The result has been that - while the school still adopts its liberal<br/>\n  approach with pupils able to make their own rules - it has had also to <br/>\n  adopt<br/>\n  the role of a disciplinarian towards them, because they know no rules. <br/>\n  In<br/>\n  Mrs Neill Redhead&#39;s words, it has had to start &quot;teaching kids that they<br/>\n  can&#39;t do what they like, that they have to have regard to other people&#39;s<br/>\n  rights and feelings - a bit of a role reversal that Neill would have <br/>\n  found<br/>\n  interesting&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The philosophy of Summerhill, which is in Leiston in Suffolk, has always<br/>\n  been that the individual has control over his or her own life. Hence the<br/>\n  policy that pupils are allowed to decide for themselves which lessons <br/>\n  they<br/>\n  want to attend - a policy criticised by Ofsted, the education standards<br/>\n  watchdog, in the late Nineties, which led the then education secretary <br/>\n  David<br/>\n  Blunkett issuing a notice of complaint against the school which could <br/>\n  have<br/>\n  led to its closure.<br/>\n<br/>\n  He was insistent that pupils should be compelled to attend lessons - but<br/>\n  ultimately lost a court battle with the school.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So Summerhill continued with its ideal that &quot;you don&#39;t have to be <br/>\n  answerable<br/>\n  to your parents or any adult; you can just get on with your life and <br/>\n  learn<br/>\n  or make mistakes&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;You can be lonely, you can be bored, you can take risks, you can be <br/>\n  really<br/>\n  nice or you can be quite horrible,&quot; says Mrs Neill Redhead. &quot;So long as <br/>\n  what<br/>\n  you do doesn&#39;t upset or hurt anybody else, you can be completely <br/>\n  yourself.&quot;<br/>\n  Unfortunately, she argues, this philosophy does not fit in with modern<br/>\n  parenting. &quot;The new parenting trend makes parents feel they have to be <br/>\n  part<br/>\n  of their children&#39;s childhood at every turn,&quot; she writes. &quot;Parents rush <br/>\n  home<br/>\n  from work or pick up the children from school and are immediately <br/>\n  involved<br/>\n  in the pattern of providing a stimulating environment for the children. <br/>\n  We<br/>\n  must not let them watch too much television, play computer games or play<br/>\n  outside in the street ... Talk to them at home and make sure that we are<br/>\n  always on hand to inspire and encourage them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;This in itself causes many tensions within the family for the obvious<br/>\n  reason that parents find it extremely difficult and tiring to provide <br/>\n  this<br/>\n  constant stream of enthusiasm and that the children are more often that <br/>\n  not<br/>\n  reluctant participants.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  As for Summerhill, it is thriving again with 84 pupils (its average was <br/>\n  60<br/>\n  while A S Neill was head), after winning its legal showdown with the<br/>\n  Government.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://red.as-eu.falkag.net/red?cmd=url&flg=0&&rdm=94074268&dlv=1028,300\">http://red.as-eu.falkag.net/red?cmd=url&flg=0&&rdm=94074268&dlv=1028,300</a><br/>\n  28,<br/>\n  386161,177088,660284&kid=177088&ucl=111111A&dmn=.mia.bellsouth.net&scx=80<br/>\n  0&s<br/>\n  cy=600&scc=32&sta=,,,1,,,,,,,0,6,0,27330,27228,14659,1642,528&iid=386161&<br/>\n  bid<br/>\n  =660284&dat=&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kelly Lovejoy<br/>\n  Conference Coordinator<br/>\n  Live and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n    &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting.

A late show - started at 10:30 - by the time we saw it and  <br/>\nstood around in the parking lot and talked about it for a while, it  <br/>\nwas 2 am when we got home.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was 8 boys ages 16 to 20, my 15 yo daughter, and me. Breakdown -  <br/>\ntwo other radical unschoolers, two pretty relaxed homeschoolers, one  <br/>\nschool-at-home homeschooler, one who goes to public school, one who  <br/>\ngraduated from high school, one who got himself out of high school  <br/>\nand is taking back his own life - after getting to know unschoolers.   <br/>\nThey mostly know each other through their karate studio. We went out  <br/>\nfor ice cream, first, then we went to see Mission Impossible. I hung  <br/>\nout with them easily, naturally, and didn&#39;t give it much thought  <br/>\nexcept I do remember saying to one of them that it had suddenly  <br/>\noccurred to me that this was a really unusual group of kids who  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t think twice about including a mom in their Friday night out  <br/>\nplans and that I was really lucky to know them. There were two other  <br/>\nadults who I thought might go along, too, but didn&#39;t. And there was  <br/>\nanother mom and her son who had ice cream with us, but didn&#39;t go to  <br/>\nthe movie. Maybe I&#39;m deluding myself, but I honestly think they like  <br/>\nme just fine and it never even occurred to them that it was in any  <br/>\nway odd for me to go with them. I was there when plans were being  <br/>\nmade and was included very naturally.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow - the other unusual thing was the 8 boys to 1 girl ratio, among  <br/>\nthe teens, I guess. but that is not unusual for my daughter - she has  <br/>\nsome girlfriends and has overnighters with them and hangs out some  <br/>\nwith them, but most of her close friends are boys.  There was another  <br/>\ngirl who had been with them earlier in the evening, at the karate  <br/>\nstudio, and we thought she was going, and also a sister of one of the  <br/>\nboys was planning to go and then backed out. My other daughter was  <br/>\nplanning to go - I was actually on my way to pick her up and she  <br/>\ncalled and said she&#39;d gotten hooked on watching recorded episodes of  <br/>\nLOST, so she&#39;d changed her mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - two back-to-back stories of movies and teens and parents being  <br/>\ninvited/included. Cool!<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way - it was really good to see Mission Impossible with a  <br/>\nbunch of teenage boys - they LOVED it - they were all charged up by  <br/>\nit, lots of adrenaline - made it that much more fun for me, just  <br/>\nobserving their reactions to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] summerhill","postDate":"1149442971","msgId":26014,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFGQURBQUMyLThDRDktNDkzMS1CMUZCLUMwOURDNjYxM0NCRkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGU1dXU3NCtjNHJkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGU1dXU3NCtjNHJkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":26013,"nextInTopic":26015,"prevInTime":26013,"nextInTime":26015,"topicId":26009,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well I guess part of the problem is that those kids still have to go to school.

Not such a great thing for life skills.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTrue.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think about that sometimes, in an unschooling context.  Sometimes  <br/>\nin the past detractors of mine have said &quot;You think you can tell  <br/>\npeople whether they can unschool.&quot;  They misunderstand deeply.  There  <br/>\nare people who can&#39;t successfully unschool, but it has nothing to do  <br/>\nwith the opinions, approval or permission of others.  They wouldn&#39;t  <br/>\nbe able to unschool even if I&#39;d never been born, or never had kids,  <br/>\nor whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people aren&#39;t energetic or creative or desirous enough to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when it comes to the social end of parenting, the nature vs.  <br/>\nnurture part is very problematical.  If parents aren&#39;t filled with  <br/>\ninterpersonal intelligence, and their children are genetically  <br/>\nlikewise unendowed, how will the children get the clues they need to  <br/>\ndeal with other people?<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool?<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes there&#39;s a teacher who&#39;s able to help kids understand some  <br/>\nsocial realities.  My 4th grade teacher was really good at  <br/>\nrelationship counseling on a casual level.  She noticed if best  <br/>\nfriends were mad at each other, or if someone was being harrassed,  <br/>\nand would give subtle suggestions to both parties to help them move  <br/>\ntoward more peaceful stuck-in-the-same-classroom co-existence.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore often, schoolKIDS &quot;teach&quot; other kids how to act, or how not to  <br/>\nact.   In some cases that might be better than nothing at all, if the  <br/>\nfamily of origin was able to provide exactly &quot;nothing at all.&quot;  It&#39;s  <br/>\ncruel and can be painful, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly and I have watched the first season of Desperate Housewives  <br/>\nthis week.  I&#39;m nearly through and she has a couple of bonus bits to  <br/>\nwatch.  That&#39;s the most intense watching she&#39;s ever done and the most  <br/>\nI&#39;ve done since The Two Towers DVDs came out.  It&#39;s a lot at once,  <br/>\nwhich is kind of fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a situation in which Lynette leaves all her kids with Bree  <br/>\nsuddenly, after all others turned her down.  Bree was saying no, but  <br/>\nshe relented.  Those kids are played as horror kids sometimes, for  <br/>\nthe effect.  Bree spanked one, for dumping a tray of homemade cookies  <br/>\nall over the floor after she had told him no, and wait, and that she  <br/>\nwould give him cookies when they were cool.  He kept going back, and  <br/>\nthen the whole pan and cookies were on the floor.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynette was furious because Bree spanked, but Lynette&#39;s tool was &quot;I  <br/>\nwill spank you&quot; and she never did (admittedly).  So the next time she  <br/>\nwas really angry with her kids, she threatened to take them to Bree&#39;s  <br/>\nhouse for a spanking. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut my rambling point is that at some level if parents are unable to  <br/>\nlearn at home how to be considerate of others, and to take &quot;no&quot; for  <br/>\nan answer about other people&#39;s personal stuff and boundaries, their  <br/>\nchildren will have to learn that somewhere else.  The idea that  <br/>\nparents whose kids weren&#39;t good at interpersonals would leave their  <br/>\nkids at a boarding school (no matter how &quot;free&quot; the curriculum) is  <br/>\nprobably the very issue central to that article.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I retract my previous defense, because I suppose it is possible  <br/>\nfor parents to be with their children SO much that the kids never  <br/>\nhave an opportunity to see whether they can get along with other  <br/>\npeople, and make social decisions without looking at their mom for  <br/>\ndirection or approval.  And a level lower is those who look to a mom  <br/>\nfor approval and she approves EVERYTHING, no matter how wrong or bad,  <br/>\nand then simple gets angry at the other people for not allowing the  <br/>\ninappropriate behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd since I&#39;ve already written a friggin&#39; book here, I will close  <br/>\nwith a recent success story.   Yesterday two of Marty&#39;s friends were  <br/>\ngoing to pick him up to go run around, but they ended up staying  <br/>\nhere.  Then another friend came over to see all my kids.  Then a  <br/>\nfriend of Kirby&#39;s from work came over.  I hadn&#39;t met her before.  She  <br/>\nwas nice.  So my three (14, 17, 19) plus four more (17-21) were all  <br/>\nhaving a great time laughing and looking at stuff on Kirby&#39;s computer  <br/>\nand around our house, and Marty&#39;s big Lego Viking village, and so forth.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey decided to go out for ice cream and then to see &quot;Over the  <br/>\nHedge.&quot;  I asked Holly if she needed money, and she didn&#39;t.  (She  <br/>\nsaves her allowance up.)  Every other person there has a job.   <br/>\nOutside of Kirby possibly having an interest in the girl from work,  <br/>\nthere were no couples.  Two of those kids do have steady others, but  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t bring them over.  So it was four teenaged girls, four teenaged  <br/>\nboys, no romantic tension (unless Kirby and new-girl; didn&#39;t see any).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here&#39;s the big success part.  They asked Keith if he wanted to  <br/>\ngo.  I didn&#39;t know they had, when Marty came and asked me if I wanted  <br/>\nto go.  So they would have taken me, or Keith, or both of us, with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe separately thanked them and declined and found out later they had  <br/>\nasked us both.

It <br/>\nwas,<br/>\nin fact, the very epitome of the kind of liberal progressive school so<br/>\nfrowned upon by education traditionalists such as Chris Woodhead, the <br/>\nformer<br/>\nschools inspector.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, in a new book, its current head, Zoe Neill Redhead, the founder&#39;s<br/>\ndaughter, reveals the school is having to adopt a more disciplinarian <br/>\ntone<br/>\ntowards its current pupils, who have been so pampered by their parents, <br/>\nshe<br/>\nsays, that they no longer know the boundaries of acceptable behaviour.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We see the results of parental interference and over-indulgence all the<br/>\ntime,&quot; she says in the book Summerhill and A S Neill, previewed in this<br/>\nweek&#39;s Times Educational Supplement and published by the Open <br/>\nUniversity.<br/>\n&quot;In modern society, parents seem to be unable to leave their kids alone <br/>\nfor<br/>\nmore than a short while. At Summerhill, we now see many children who <br/>\nare in<br/>\nconstant search of adult influence and stimulation, unable to quietly <br/>\nget<br/>\nalong with their own lives without the need for admiration and <br/>\nattention.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe result has been that - while the school still adopts its liberal<br/>\napproach with pupils able to make their own rules - it has had also to <br/>\nadopt<br/>\nthe role of a disciplinarian towards them, because they know no rules. <br/>\nIn<br/>\nMrs Neill Redhead&#39;s words, it has had to start &quot;teaching kids that they<br/>\ncan&#39;t do what they like, that they have to have regard to other people&#39;s<br/>\nrights and feelings - a bit of a role reversal that Neill would have <br/>\nfound<br/>\ninteresting&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe philosophy of Summerhill, which is in Leiston in Suffolk, has always<br/>\nbeen that the individual has control over his or her own life. Hence the<br/>\npolicy that pupils are allowed to decide for themselves which lessons <br/>\nthey<br/>\nwant to attend - a policy criticised by Ofsted, the education standards<br/>\nwatchdog, in the late Nineties, which led the then education secretary <br/>\nDavid<br/>\nBlunkett issuing a notice of complaint against the school which could <br/>\nhave<br/>\nled to its closure.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was insistent that pupils should be compelled to attend lessons - but<br/>\nultimately lost a court battle with the school.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Summerhill continued with its ideal that &quot;you don&#39;t have to be <br/>\nanswerable<br/>\nto your parents or any adult; you can just get on with your life and <br/>\nlearn<br/>\nor make mistakes&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You can be lonely, you can be bored, you can take risks, you can be <br/>\nreally<br/>\nnice or you can be quite horrible,&quot; says Mrs Neill Redhead. &quot;So long as <br/>\nwhat<br/>\nyou do doesn&#39;t upset or hurt anybody else, you can be completely <br/>\nyourself.&quot;<br/>\nUnfortunately, she argues, this philosophy does not fit in with modern<br/>\nparenting. &quot;The new parenting trend makes parents feel they have to be <br/>\npart<br/>\nof their children&#39;s childhood at every turn,&quot; she writes. &quot;Parents rush <br/>\nhome<br/>\n from work or pick up the children from school and are immediately <br/>\ninvolved<br/>\nin the pattern of providing a stimulating environment for the children. <br/>\nWe<br/>\nmust not let them watch too much television, play computer games or play<br/>\noutside in the street ... Talk to them at home and make sure that we are<br/>\nalways on hand to inspire and encourage them.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;This in itself causes many tensions within the family for the obvious<br/>\nreason that parents find it extremely difficult and tiring to provide <br/>\nthis<br/>\nconstant stream of enthusiasm and that the children are more often that <br/>\nnot<br/>\nreluctant participants.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Summerhill, it is thriving again with 84 pupils (its average was <br/>\n60<br/>\nwhile A S Neill was head), after winning its legal showdown with the<br/>\nGovernment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://red.as-eu.falkag.net/red?cmd=url&flg=0&&rdm=94074268&dlv=1028,300\">http://red.as-eu.falkag.net/red?cmd=url&flg=0&&rdm=94074268&dlv=1028,300</a><br/>\n28,<br/>\n386161,177088,660284&kid=177088&ucl=111111A&dmn=.mia.bellsouth.net&scx=80<br/>\n0&s<br/>\ncy=600&scc=32&sta=,,,1,,,,,,,0,6,0,27330,27228,14659,1642,528&iid=386161&<br/>\nbid<br/>\n=660284&dat=&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting.
