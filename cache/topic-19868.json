My <br/>\nclasses are loving them.  We are doing a pretty intense (for 6th grade) <br/>\ncompare and contrast between Romeo and Juliet, and Westside Story.  I am <br/>\nonly showing portions of R&J, but the kids are really getting into the <br/>\nlanguage.  There&#39;s no fear of it.  I am reading a few vital scenes and <br/>\nthen we watch that portion of the movie.  Then we watch those parts of <br/>\nWestside, but we are watching ALL of westside, not just a bit. Today we <br/>\ncompared the balcony scenes.  Tomorrow the weddings.  ANd the &quot;rumbles&quot;. <br/>\n  It&#39;s very interesting to see the kids react to my reading.  I&#39;ve been <br/>\naccused of memorizing R&J, and while I recognize that I LOVE that play <br/>\nand have much of it committed to memory, or almost, I could not do it <br/>\nwithout the book.  I&#39;m getting a big head, here, but it just shows you <br/>\nthat if the teacher is absolutely thrilled with teaching something that <br/>\nshe loves, that the kids will get into it as well!  However, I am glad <br/>\nthere are no adults watching.  I totally loose myself in the moment, and <br/>\nact like I&#39;ve never done before!  It is also showing me that these <br/>\nstudents can understand more than we often give them credit for being <br/>\nable to understand.  Although they say that my own emphasis and body <br/>\nlanguage helps them understand the language, as well as the wonderful <br/>\nactors in the movie.  Yes, they lack significant background and daily <br/>\nknowledge our children get, but they are still capable beings and given <br/>\nthe right climate can succeed beyond their dreams.  It&#39;s neat to see <br/>\nthem leave saying &quot;parting is such sweet sorrow.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWe also have done Annie, and they are still going around singing &quot;Easy <br/>\nStreet&quot; and &quot;Hard Knock Life.&quot;  There is more music in this world than <br/>\nrap!  Amazing!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe may have an opportunity to see Kiss Me Kate, so I may be reading bits <br/>\nof Taming of the Shrew, and then letting them watch the <br/>\nElizabeth/Richard version.
