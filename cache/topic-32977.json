If the number was off, he&#39;d hunt it down.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a favorite family story from when he was in elementary school. He was given a dollar to buy something at school, and during the walk to school memorized its serial number. When he got there to pay for whatever the dollar was for, some older boys in upper grades basically stole his dollar. When he told a teacher what had happened, he was able to give the dollar&#39;s serial number as proof that the other students had it. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe went on to get an MBA from Harvard, work in Spain for a Spanish bank, which then took him to Hong Kong (where he lives) and China where he now works for various banks as a banking/finance consultant. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a child, he probably appeared to be obsessive about money. As an adult, he used it to his advantage and built on this strength.

If so, you could get forty $1 bills -- that&#39;s a nice little mountain of money to pile on the bed and look at [g]. Or maybe split it up so she gets $5 or $10 in quarters + some $1 bills + some $5 bills. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen our son was younger, when my hubby&#39;s change jar would get full, he&#39;d give it to our son and tell him he could have the dollars once we exchanged the change for dollars (which we&#39;d do that day or the next). It would only happen about twice a year, but it&#39;d be anywhere from $50 or $60 each time, which was a huge treat for kiddo. (Now that he&#39;s older and gets a larger allowance, the change jar is dedicated as &quot;vacation fun money&quot;.) <br/>\n<br/>\nAn alternative to letting a kiddo have all the money in the change jar is to let them sort out a particular kind of change -- the pennies or nickels, maybe -- and take that to the bank or money exchange machine at the grocery store and swap it out for dollars.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor several years, Andrew would often set up a store or a cafe in his room and I would use toy money to pay him for my purchases. But you could use money from the change jar instead of toy money. For the cafe, Andrew made up a menu and he acquired a small collection of dishes from Goodwill that he chose to buy with his own allowance. He made a sign for his door, and for a short period of time he typed up a newsletter for his cafe which diners could read while they were waiting on their order [g]. If he&#39;d asked, or if I&#39;d thought about it, we could&#39;ve used change-jar money instead of toy money -- we had a toy cash register and he just opted to use the toy money that came with it. Anyway, this particular idea doesn&#39;t relate to allowance, but it is a fun way your daughter could earn some change if this kind of thing appealed to her or inspired her in any way.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":266704357,"authorName":"Debra Garner","from":"&quot;Debra Garner&quot; &lt;debra@...&gt;","profile":"teecups4me","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Allowance","postDate":"1270776815","msgId":52564,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU0RjExNjgyQzNCRjQ0REM5MzQzREJBOUEyQzQ0MkIwQERlYnJhUEM+","inReplyToHeader":"PGhwbHVwMitoYzgzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhwbHVwMitoYzgzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":52563,"nextInTopic":52574,"prevInTime":52563,"nextInTime":52565,"topicId":32977,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My parents did something similar- we had a a base allowance but could earn more by doing extra jobs.

We started off doing a weekly allowance equivalent to his age, and did that for four or five years. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce he really got into video games, saving a weekly allowance until he had enough money to buy one game was frustrating for him, so he asked to start receiving his allowance monthly. Around that same time, we started giving him a flat $50/month -- that generally covered any game purchases he wanted in a month&#39;s time. If he and I were both interested in the same game, then we&#39;d split the cost of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nA year and a half ago, Andrew discovered the Xbox 360. Those games tend to run $59.99 new, but most of the time the $50/month allowance worked just fine because he&#39;d plan ahead for upcoming games and budget accordingly -- sometimes Rodney and I would buy a game for him when we could, and my mom and other relatives here always give cash or gift cards to Andrew for birthdays and Christmas so that he can buy games he wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in the last month or two, I&#39;ve noticed his allowance just isn&#39;t jiving with his gaming wants. He&#39;s become more and more interested in older games, some of which can be downloaded onto the Xbox or Wii or PS2, some of which can be found used on Amazon or Ebay, most of which aren&#39;t available to rent. He reads and watches online reviews, then researches online to see if the games can be found and how much they cost -- he&#39;s being thoughtful about what he wants. He loves comparing these old games to each other and to newer versions, and writing his own reviews of them, and making video playthroughs (to post on YouTube) for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night we were at the video game store and he was looking through a gaming guide. I offered to buy it for him because he has the game that corresponds to it rented right now, with the intent to buy the game when he can. He was kind of glum and said he didn&#39;t know when he&#39;d be able to buy the game because it&#39;s $59.99 -- if he used May&#39;s allowance + the $10 he has left this month, he can get the game at the first of May, but then he wouldn&#39;t have money left to buy another game until June. It wasn&#39;t a &quot;poor me&quot; kind of thing at all; he was simply bummed that if he bought the game, he wouldn&#39;t have allowance to buy another game until June. I told him that I&#39;d split the cost of the game with him in May, so that he would still be able to buy downloadable games or whatever, and that cheered him up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, in the shower this morning, I had one of those &quot;Duh! Why didn&#39;t I think of this sooner???&quot; thoughts. I realized that it&#39;s time to adjust his allowance so that it better meets his needs. I talked with my husband about it and we agreed to double Andrew&#39;s allowance. I know some parents would freak about the idea of a $100/month allowance -- in fact, my hubby and I both freaked a little about it ourselves [g]. But when we put it into perspective, we agreed that it&#39;s something we can afford to do right now, so we will. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the things we considered that helped us put it into perspective:<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Other than the cost of Xbox Live, this is really the only consistent monthly expense we have for Andrew. At the end of March, Andrew opted to drop out of the acting class he was taking because he wasn&#39;t enjoying it. That class was $45/month, so freeing that up offsets the increase in allowance (we didn&#39;t present it to Andrew that way, but for budgeting purposes it helped Rodney and I to keep this in mind). <br/>\n<br/>\n~ If Andrew was in school, there would be expenses related to that, and his allowance would be above and beyond those expenses. We don&#39;t have school-related expenses, so why not adjust his allowance to reflect that.<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Andrew has never had expectations that we would buy things for him that exceeded his allowance. Sometimes we offer to -- sometimes he accepts those offers, other times he doesn&#39;t. For the past five-ish years, he&#39;s been very thoughtful with his allowance, planning ahead and budgeting for the things he&#39;s wanted to buy with it -- in fact, I&#39;ve commented to him many times that he&#39;s been a good example for me in that respect, and it&#39;s true! While some people would say he&#39;s spoiled for getting a $50/month allowance, he&#39;s shown that he&#39;s responsible with his spending and he doesn&#39;t expect us to pick up the difference when his allowance is less than his wants. He&#39;s truly appreciative of getting an allowance.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy hubby is working out of town this week, so after he and I talked and agreed upon the allowance increase, I asked if he&#39;d like to share the news with Andrew -- it was so cool watching the ear-to-ear smile spread across Andrew&#39;s face as they talked. I headed outside while they finished chatting, and Andrew came outside after they were done and gave me a big hug and thanked me (Rodney had told him it was my idea). I told him we were happy to do it for him. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe said he knew that if things got really tight financially, we might have to decrease it but that would be okay with him -- and I know he means it. He&#39;s seen that I&#39;ve always treated his allowance with the same importance I treat other monthly bills -- it&#39;s budgeted and given to him when I pay bills each month, rather than being treated as an afterthought. That part is particularly important to me, not treating his allowance as an afterthought -- when I was a kid, even though we were supposed to get an allowance, actually getting it was sporadic, yet my mom and stepdad would somehow have &quot;extras&quot;, which I thought was terribly unfair. So, for me, making sure I have Andrew&#39;s allowance money for him when he&#39;s supposed to get has always been important to me, even back when he was 4 and didn&#39;t yet know the days of the week to know which day was Friday (ie, allowance day) [g].<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, that&#39;s been our journey thus far regarding allowances. I&#39;m open to the idea of Andrew&#39;s allowance possibly increasing again a time or two before he reaches driving age. Hopefully it won&#39;t take me as long to notice when it&#39;s time for another change [g]!!<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77228268,"authorName":"Marla","from":"&quot;Marla&quot; &lt;marla@...&gt;","profile":"hilltowner4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Allowance","postDate":"1270751257","msgId":52560,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhwbDc2cCs4aWlpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDRCQkQ2RjNCLjQwNTA4MDRAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":52556,"nextInTopic":52561,"prevInTime":52559,"nextInTime":52561,"topicId":32977,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I agree, Pam.

Once was from my mom&#39;s purse, $2 that was visible in the open  <br/>\nzipper. My mother had told me since I could remember, &quot;Don&#39;t ever steal. If you <br/>\n need money, ASK me.&quot; Problem was, when I *did* ask, I got asked in return <br/>\nwhat  it was for and I don&#39;t ever remember anything being &quot;valid&quot; enough in her <br/>\nrealm  of reasoning to say yes. I asked and asked but the answer was always, <br/>\n&quot;No.&quot; So,  I made my own &quot;yes&quot;.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe second was the stash of change my dad had in his wardrobe. I was  <br/>\nyoung-ish (11?). Definitely inexperienced and unaware of many things-I was  <br/>\n&quot;sheltered&quot;. Those dusty old coins in jars and bowls in his wardrobe just sat  there <br/>\ngetting older and dustier. In my realm of understanding at the time, old  and <br/>\ndusty meant less worth. So, when I wanted some candy one day (candy was  <br/>\ndefinitely forbidden except for special occasions), I dug out a dollar or two&#39;s  <br/>\nworth of dimes and nickels and took them to our local store in our small town.  My <br/>\nmom&#39;s friend was a cashier there and asked my mom later on if we had gone to  <br/>\nCanada on vacation and my thievery was discovered. My mother explained while <br/>\nshe  yelled at me that my dad had collected those coins over the years and <br/>\nthat they  were OLD (and from the way she said it, I understood that old coins <br/>\nhad  value-more value than new coins! Go figure...) and that he&#39;d collected some <br/>\nof  those coins from places he&#39;d been while he was onboard his aircraft <br/>\ncarrier in  the Navy and that he&#39;d been saving them for years to pass down to his <br/>\nson. My  dad built a wooden box in the bottom of that wardrobe with a padlock <br/>\non it and  it stayed locked until I inherited the wardrobe after they built <br/>\nclosets in  their bedroom. That box broke my heart. Everytime I looked at my <br/>\ndad&#39;s wardrobe,  it was a reminder. After it was explained to me the value, both <br/>\ninvestment-wise  *and* sentimental-wise, I would never have taken that money <br/>\nagain, so to top it  off with a locked box for the coins made me feel worse than <br/>\nthe label of thief.  It meant to me that my dear dad thought I didn&#39;t care <br/>\nabout his feelings-which  was certainly not true! And 30+ years later, my <br/>\nparents still think of me as  untrustworthy. A thief. For $4 or less. For two <br/>\ninstances as a kid.

They took into  <br/>\naccount how MUCH someone else would enjoy something or how much they  <br/>\nneeded it.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoya was the most impulsive spender in our family - but now she&#39;s 23  <br/>\nand has a full-time career and is 100% responsible for herself. She  <br/>\njust bought a car, she has health insurance, she is paying off her own  <br/>\nstudent loan and she had a performance review at her job this week and  <br/>\nthey gave her a 6% raise! She&#39;s careful with her money and she saves  <br/>\nsome out of every paycheck.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoxana is now 20 - about 3 years ago I gave her an atm card for my  <br/>\nregular bank account - so she has total access to our checking and  <br/>\nsavings and credit card. I also got her a credit card in her own name.  <br/>\nI never worry that she&#39;s going to take out too much - if she needs a  <br/>\nlot, she brings it up in advance. She has been involved in theater and  <br/>\noften goes out to eat after rehearsals or shows and she can always get  <br/>\ncash if she needs it. She takes college classes and can get cash for  <br/>\nlunch money or to pay for books or supplies. Sometimes she gets a  <br/>\nlittle extra cash to offer to pay for gas when she has friends driving  <br/>\nher here and there. She doesn&#39;t take the money and spend it  <br/>\nfrivolously - she&#39;s careful with it. Rox is in France now and living  <br/>\non her own in an apartment - I don&#39;t worry about her going nuts and  <br/>\noverspending. In fact, I have to remind her that this is a big giant  <br/>\nlife-changing experience and it is okay to splurge (she didn&#39;t go to  <br/>\nEuroDisney because we live right by Disneyland - been there a million  <br/>\ntimes - and she thought EuroDisney was too expensive).<br/>\n<br/>\nRosie is the same way - she&#39;s now 17, and she has her own money  <br/>\nbecause she gets paid to teach martial arts classes. But she&#39;s careful  <br/>\nwith it - not foolish. She&#39;s saved up about $1400 for a trip to New  <br/>\nYork City (taking the train from Southern California to NYC, staying  <br/>\nthere a week, taking the train back home - ANYBODY with any possible  <br/>\nleads on affordable places to stay for 7 people in Manhattan - please  <br/>\ncontact me offlist).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe didn&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; them to handle money - they learned by handling it  <br/>\nat whatever level they could. We did give them about $50 per month,  <br/>\nonce they were in their early teens, specifically for buying their own  <br/>\nclothes and for gifts for friends. Interestingly, they&#39;d still ask for  <br/>\nmy opinion about their clothes, but - it was THEIR money and that made  <br/>\na difference in my attitude. II wasn&#39;t my decision whether it was  <br/>\nworth buying or not worth buying.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they were even littler, we&#39;d give them money to spend that day.  <br/>\nIf we went to Disneyland, we might give them each $10 and say, &quot;That&#39;s  <br/>\npretty much the money we can afford for treats or souvenirs for  <br/>\ntoday.&quot; If they wanted something, they&#39;d spend it. Sometimes they  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t spend it. OFTEN they pooled their money to get something.  <br/>\nSometimes one would give some of hers to a sister who really wanted  <br/>\nsomething too expensive. Sometimes I&#39;d see that there was something  <br/>\nthey wanted that they couldn&#39;t afford and I&#39;d buy it as a gift for  <br/>\nthem, maybe for later. Anyway, all kinds of possibilities - we weren&#39;t  <br/>\nrigid about this.

She said &quot;I like feeding Ben&#39;s dogs  <br/>\nbetter than Sadie&#39;s, because they food&#39;s still measured, but they  <br/>\ngive them more of it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEverywhere my kids have fed dogs (I&#39;m thinking of four houses, people  <br/>\nI know in all), the dogs are fed by the clock and by the measure.   <br/>\nThe dogs are rambunctious and knock each other and people away to get  <br/>\nto the food, and they beg and bug people all the time between times.   <br/>\nThey&#39;re hungry.  They&#39;re needy.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur dog was at the vet a few months back, for the first time in  <br/>\nyears.  The vet did the routine thing, and asked what she was eating,  <br/>\nand Keith said &quot;table scraps, some of her food, some of the cats&#39;  <br/>\nfood; whatever she wants.&quot;  The vet was stunned and had no follow-up  <br/>\nspeech.  Our dog&#39;s not the least bit fat, and she&#39;s ten years old  <br/>\nthis season,  and running around fine.  It seemed from what Keith was  <br/>\nsaying that the vet figured there must be something wrong with her  <br/>\nfor her not to be fat, if she had unlimited food.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot only does Gudrun let the cats come up and eat what&#39;s been put  <br/>\ndown for her (she knows they&#39;ll never finish it), and the cats let  <br/>\nher eat from their bowls, but when we have visiting dogs, Gudrun will  <br/>\nlet them eat too.  She&#39;ll chase dogs away from the front of the house  <br/>\nif they&#39;re out there, but if we let them in the house and tell her  <br/>\nit&#39;s okay, she doesn&#39;t growl about her food.  I think it&#39;s because  <br/>\nshe knows if the bowl&#39;s empty we&#39;ll put some more down.  She eats  <br/>\ndry, and sometimes cooking- or table-scraps, and she loves cheese (so  <br/>\nwe grate a little too much each time and let her have some) and  <br/>\npeanut butter) so stale bread or leftover pancakes become peanut  <br/>\nbutter sandwiches for her, which we break into little pieces.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone said once &quot;So we&#39;re unschooling our dogs now?&quot;  I don&#39;t think  <br/>\nit&#39;s unschooling, and I don&#39;t really think of what we&#39;re doing with  <br/>\nthe kids at such levels to be unschooling either.  I think it&#39;s  <br/>\nliving naturally--paying attention to what people want and need, and  <br/>\nkeeping them from being desperately needy or frustrated.  It has  <br/>\nworked with our dog too, and the cats.  The yard isn&#39;t fenced.  They  <br/>\ncan take off when and if they want to.  They don&#39;t want to.  They  <br/>\nhave it good here, and we&#39;re nice to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven without comparing their own lives to other people their age, our  <br/>\nkids have taken a lesson in behavior and psychology from feeding  <br/>\nother people&#39;s dogs and comparing all that to our pets.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestions about allowance can be recast as &quot;What will you provide?   <br/>\nWhat choices can others make when they HAVE a choice?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a dog knows he has to eat fast and defensively or go hungry, he&#39;ll  <br/>\neat fast and defensively.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a dog knows there will be more food there when she&#39;s hungry, she  <br/>\nonly eats when she&#39;s hungry.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":199360242,"authorName":"graberamy","from":"&quot;graberamy&quot; &lt;graber@...&gt;","profile":"graberamy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Allowance","postDate":"1205351712","msgId":32994,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZyOWNmMCttdGQ1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQzOTA1QTdBLTM5RDktNEU4MC1CRjc0LUM4RUQ0QkE1ODc1NEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":32988,"nextInTopic":32996,"prevInTime":32993,"nextInTime":32995,"topicId":32977,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

(www.aniboom.com  Really cool<br/>\nand FREE BTW)<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout 30 minutes later, he comes down the stairs and asks me if I<br/>\nnoticed his &quot;chores list&quot;.  Then he brings me to look.  I feel asleep<br/>\nearly last night (ahhh... pregnancy) and apparently my husband and S.<br/>\nmade this list together.  We have not required or asked any &quot;chores&quot;<br/>\nor cleaning of him for a very long time.  I don&#39;t know who initiated<br/>\nit.  I don&#39;t know any details other than the fact that it was there<br/>\nthis morning, he seemed happy, and he had proudly cleaned his room.  S<br/>\npresented this to me this morning and said &quot;I was thinking  I could<br/>\nget about 4 bucks a week, every Saturday, for this.&quot; I&#39;m pretty sure<br/>\nhe came up with his own dollar amount.  He said he wanted 2 dollars to<br/>\nsave, and 2 dollars to spend.  ( wants to open a bank account for his<br/>\nsavings!  COOL!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, we chatted, and I chatted with my husband and we all came to<br/>\nthe conclusion that &quot;YES, definitely.  4 dollars every Saturday is<br/>\nyour allowance.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo... here&#39;s my questions.  <br/>\n     - should I ask my husband who&#39;s idea it was?  does it matter how<br/>\nit was handled.  I&#39;m not suspecting any coercion and he seems really<br/>\nindependent and content with his proposition.<br/>\n<br/>\n     - if he decided NOT to do the list he made, which he inevitably<br/>\nwill (LOL) how should this work?  I don&#39;t think his allowance should<br/>\nbe contingent on whether he completes chores or not.  But I feel that<br/>\nhe has made a commitment to us.  Maybe I should help him honor that,<br/>\nby helping him complete his list?  or reworking his list?  or should I<br/>\njust stay out of it and give him 4 dollars every saturday as promised?<br/>\n<br/>\n     -what if he drops the list altogether.  I don&#39;t mind.  I just<br/>\nwant to be able to say the right words to him I guess.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance.  This is my first allowance! :-)  i never got<br/>\nallowance as a kid.  Even if I did I&#39;m pretty sure it would have been<br/>\nhandled very poorly.  LOL</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52596,"nextTopicId":52613}}
