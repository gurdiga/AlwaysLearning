I know that if my son spends the day in the house, he&#39;s very hard to get to sleep. Also, maybe try a bedtime routine with him so his body clock learns when to wind down. Like after supper let him romp around but maybe just for a half hour, then suggest something calming like a book you can read together or a show or movie on tv. Then have him bathe, which is relaxing, right before you want him to start settling in for the night. But that playing outside works wonders-I got that one from my Grandma a long time ago! Good luck with him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;joanne.lopers&quot; &lt;wilmalv@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I enjoy when people post things that they have discovered on their own work for their families.
