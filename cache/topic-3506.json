I also have a 2 year old nursing toddler. We have been at <br/>\nhome learning since the birth of my oldest. I&#39;m very impressed with the <br/>\nfeedback and personal stories regarding TV. I went TV free some 10 years <br/>\nago. For me this was very enlightning. Maybe I learned more about myself in <br/>\n6 months than my entire childhood. The TV was unlimited in my house I grew <br/>\nup in and a major substitute for an available parent. I also find it non <br/>\ncommunitive in that people around me veg out, myself included. It puts me <br/>\ninto an alpha state of consciousness very quickly. I usually do not remember <br/>\nwhat I watch, the story line, the characters. Now, if I read a book, I <br/>\nremember forever. Also when I experience something , I retain/remember all <br/>\nthe details. I love live theater because I retain what I saw and can develop <br/>\nan opinion later. With TV, I veg, it is lost time to me. Now that I&#39;m older, <br/>\na mere 35, my time is important. I have loads of things I want to do and <br/>\nlearn. No time for TV viewing, though it sounds like I&#39;m missing good <br/>\nthings.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext Topic:<br/>\n<br/>\nClasses. We have great social gathering with our homeschool group. We have <br/>\nput on many wonderful performances, learned about ancient cultures, have <br/>\neaten tons of various cultures foods, played games, done crafts, made peace <br/>\nworkshops,... I&#39;ve only been invovled for 4 years with the groups. What is <br/>\nso nice about our homeschooling community is that each group activity is <br/>\ntruly a social gathering for families. One week it is our family providing <br/>\nsnacks and scripts about the Celtic culture. Another week, another family. <br/>\nSometimes we do things for 6 weeks or so, other times its a one time deal. <br/>\nThe synergy is incredible. The older kids help pull in shy or hesitant kids <br/>\nin a very gentle way. The kids can listen or not, participate or not. They <br/>\nabsorb, they play. We, the adults provide the ideas, ususally because one of <br/>\nour kids are into it, and then we grow from there. Lately it has been acting <br/>\nfor many families. We have learned that structure inhibits us and we reach <br/>\nbeyond the box and invent our own ways. Families come when they want, no <br/>\nexpectations. I dig our group and our social gatherings. We made soap, <br/>\ncandles, bath salts, all together, for gift giving. So fun to be with <br/>\nfriends always learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nBaby is now asleep on my lap, TV is on with The Princess Diary. I&#39;m taking <br/>\ncare or my 3 1/2 year old neice for 5 days. She is playing with Legos. It <br/>\nsnowed in Davis Ca. on Monday. It is very cold. We went to the Raptor Center <br/>\nand saw loads of rescued birds, hiked with some other homeschooling families <br/>\n(one of our social gatherings aka classes) played at McDolalds. It is 2 pm <br/>\nnow. Thank you all for throwing the party. I would love to donate my TV, but <br/>\nI live in a family and would offend those here who love it. My passionate <br/>\nson will get to see TV, though I feel it isn&#39;t the best for his developing <br/>\nself. Constant compromise.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary H.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3603,"nextTopicId":3583}}
