I am very thrilled. I wasn&#39;t really<br/>\nwantingher to do this, but she was begging<br/>\nfor some sort of school thing, and so I found<br/>\nthis, which is, as I said, a one day a week<br/>\nfull day school thing with other<br/>\nhomeschoolers.  Most are homeschoolers,<br/>\nthough, and not unschoolers, and as Lexie<br/>\nsaid &quot;there are more and more rules every<br/>\ntime I go!&quot;  Her only reason for staying was<br/>\nthe kids, she loves being around other<br/>\nchildren, but she said &quot;I never get to do<br/>\nanything with them, I have to be quiet and<br/>\nsit but then the other kids talk and the<br/>\nteacher has to tell them to be quiet and they<br/>\ndon&#39;t, and so I don&#39;t learn anything,<br/>\nanyway.&quot;  The last months she was talking<br/>\nabout how she really wasn&#39;t learning<br/>\nanything, except for in Spanish.  Also, I<br/>\nthink she saw a lot of stuff she didn&#39;t like,<br/>\nthe management issues, how kids who behaved<br/>\n(like she did) were &quot;punished&quot; (her word)<br/>\nalong with those who misbehaved (example, the<br/>\npe teacher said that those who behaved could<br/>\nhelp her with something but then decided that<br/>\neveryone had misbehaved and no one could help<br/>\nand Lexie said that she and brett and another<br/>\nchild had behaved but the teacher hadn&#39;t seen<br/>\nthis or didn&#39;t care.  typical school stuff).<br/>\nAnyway, she agreed the other night that the<br/>\nwork was all very easy, except for the<br/>\nwriting, which she says &quot;I can do that on my<br/>\nown&quot; and that she hadn&#39;t relaly learned<br/>\nanything &quot;except in Spanish&quot; and &quot;I can do<br/>\nthat on my own, better&quot; and she doesn&#39;t like<br/>\ngetting up so early, etc.  So she wants to<br/>\nnot go.  We will attempt to spend time with<br/>\nthe kids she has chosen to stay in contact<br/>\nwith, she made a list of 4-5 kids she wants<br/>\nto keep seeing.  I am concerned about Janene,<br/>\nshe has two older boys she loves there, and<br/>\nshe wont&#39; see them again, but I am certain<br/>\nthis is the right decision.  Change is hard,<br/>\neven if we know it&#39;s for the best.  I am<br/>\ntaking tomorrow off from work to go wtih her<br/>\non the last day of the semester, so we can<br/>\nget phone numbers of the friends she wants to<br/>\nstay in contact with and so I can try to talk<br/>\nto those parents.  Not sure if we&#39;ll stay the<br/>\nentire day or not...<br/>\n<br/>\nI am very pleased about this decision, but a<br/>\nbit surprised.  She has all along said she<br/>\nloved it, but what I see she really loves is<br/>\nthe social, and I think she realized that the<br/>\nconfounds of school makes the social she love<br/>\njust not happen.  We&#39;ll ahve to work hard to<br/>\nmaintain these relationships...<br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2268,"nextTopicId":2274}}
