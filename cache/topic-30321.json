I  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t take a camera.   If anyone here has photos in a public place I  <br/>\ncould see, that would be very cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby was there.  He ran a workshop on games based on history, and he  <br/>\nwas on a young adult homeschoolers&#39; panel.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did three talks and was on two panels.  (Hey, maybe that&#39;s why I&#39;m  <br/>\nso tired!)  They&#39;re for sale on CD, but I don&#39;t know the details yet  <br/>\n(and anyone who does is welcome to put that here).<br/>\n<br/>\nPam Sorooshian was there with Rose and Roxana.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile we were there, we went to see Stardust, which was highly  <br/>\nrecommended by Marty (and others).<br/>\nWhen Keith, Holly and Marty picked me and Kirby up at the airport,  <br/>\nthey had the plan to go see Stardust.  Kirby had already promised a  <br/>\ncouple of friends he would meet with them (separately, at different  <br/>\ntimes), so we picked our friend Bo up when he got off work (same time  <br/>\nas our flight and not far from there), went to Dion&#39;s, took Kirby  <br/>\nhome, and went to see Stardust.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday I will put up a new page which isn&#39;t there yet containing the  <br/>\nquestions asked on paper at the unschooling panel.  We only got to  <br/>\nabout half of them.  And the other panelists will be contacted so  <br/>\nthey can write answers to any that interest them particularly, if  <br/>\nthey want to.   So the conference isn&#39;t over for me yet.  Oh! and  <br/>\nthen there&#39;s laundry and paper and such--sorting the games out and  <br/>\ndeciding which go with Kirby to Texas tomorrow and which stay here.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby to Texas tomorrow...<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30315,"nextTopicId":30323}}
