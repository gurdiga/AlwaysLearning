I remember when my best friend had a bathroom put in their house.  I also remember using oil lamps when the electricity went out.  I have my grandparent&#39;s and great grandparents oil lamps sitting on my fireplace mantel.  My dad went to a one room school and he was born in 1938.  My grandfather was a school teacher - he had an 8th grade education so he qualified to teach, but he was born in 189_  (something).  I remember the Saturday night bath - now I shower every morning.  Both my parents were born at home.  We only had a black and white TV with 3 channels (rabbit ears on the top) - even color TV&#39;s became available and we got one when I was in high school we still only had 3 channels and there was no such thing as renting a movie.

When my son is really upset and falls into<br/>\nthe midst of a tantrum, he wants nothing to do with being touched,<br/>\nmuch less hugged in that moment; and in fact, trying to comfort him<br/>\nout of a tantrum only makes him scream louder.  This has taken some<br/>\ntime for me to understand and get used to; but when I really thought<br/>\nabout it, I realized I&#39;m the same way.  If I were angry or upset about<br/>\nsomething and my SO wanted to just hug me and poopoo it away before I<br/>\nhad finished expressing myself, I would be insulted and even angrier.<br/>\n (This has actually happened before, and I said to him &quot;I&#39;m not<br/>\ndone!&quot;)  I think children deserve the same respect to be allowed to<br/>\nfeel their way through strong emotions.

I learned to suppress my emotions and am to this<br/>\nday still learning to give myself permission to feel them.  (I&#39;m<br/>\npretty sure that&#39;s why movies are so therapeutic for me; they bring up<br/>\nthose emotions I&#39;ve been trained to suppress.)  So, when my son is<br/>\nmelting in anger, I offer the hug or touch first to see if he wants<br/>\ncomfort (which is usually not yet), then I sit near him (within a foot<br/>\nor two) to let him know I&#39;m there to comfort him when he&#39;s ready.  And<br/>\nindeed, within a few minutes, he turns to me, wraps his arms around my<br/>\nneck, and settles in for comforting.  He&#39;s only 2 and not yet talking<br/>\nmuch; but when he&#39;s older, I expect this will follow with discussion<br/>\nas appropriate.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things that&#39;s helped me to &quot;stay on their side&quot; in the<br/>\nmidst of a tantrum is the advice I read on one of these lists (sorry I<br/>\nforget the author and am poorly paraphrasing) that a tantrum is an<br/>\nopportunity to practice my best mothering skills.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTanya</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":308765881,"authorName":"Tanya Ziegler","from":"&quot;Tanya Ziegler&quot; &lt;tanyaz1@...&gt;","profile":"tanyaziegler","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: stressful life","postDate":"1211478332","msgId":35056,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGcxNGJmcytzNnJyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDg0NkFCMkM1LTI2M0ItNDFDOS05QjJELTBFRjc3QkRGOTg1OUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":35055,"nextInTopic":35057,"prevInTime":35055,"nextInTime":35057,"topicId":35021,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Stress in us always seems to bring about a higher &quot;neediness&quot; in our children.  Somehow they just want to find safety, find security and if you are always DOING for and with them, that feels pretty safe!<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to say that I know your pain with your grandmother.  I lost my grams almost 4 years ago now when she was 89--and right up to the end everything seemed pretty ok.  There was enough time to prepare....in other words, to feel a tremendous and deep sorrow, unlike anything I had ever experienced.  Tell your children how you feel.  Tell them you are sad.  My kids were then only 2,6, and 10.  But you know what?  They were the only ones who truly comforted me.  Kids say the things that are the closest to the truth, and sometimes the closest to our souls.  For all these years, seems like 1 day btw, that have passed, they continue to be the only ones who can just BE with me when I am sad; who don&#39;t try to fix anything or avoid the sorrow,.  They have really felt what I needed, without me having to point it out.  I don&#39;t feel better about her being gone anymore today than I did when she died.  When you grow up with someone the way it sounds like you did, with her in your life in a very important way--seems almost like we depend on them always being there.  And certainly your grandma has lived to be so old, that at some point I am sure it kind of was forgotten that she would ever not be with you.  Anyway, tell your kids, share your tears, and let them hug you.  It&#39;s ok to be stressed and sorrowful.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all have times in our lives we are not our best.  But that is part of life and it is healthy for your children to see that even supermom has needs and sometimes that THEY can DO FOR YOU.  If you can, go be with her.  Take the kids if you can.  If you can&#39;t, then don&#39;t and go anyway that you can.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut just allow.......yes, stressful living ain&#39;t easy, but I think sometimes we put so much pressure on being &quot;the best&quot; that it makes it almost impossible to just live.

It&#39;s part of why church works, y&#39;know.  Religious  <br/>\nceremonies have some things in common, or at least three or four of  <br/>\nthe set:  Fire, water, chanting (and especially &quot;mmmmm&quot; words like  <br/>\n&quot;om&quot; or &quot;ammmmen&quot;), banners/flags/streamers/cloth, and a pointy- <br/>\ntopped space (ideally, and I think it&#39;s for acoustical/vibrational  <br/>\npurposes).  Even in little old churches, there&#39;s often a high part of  <br/>\nthe ceiling.  Even in a half-underground, roudish Saxon church in  <br/>\nCambridge, England, the ceiling is high.  Outside gatherings might be  <br/>\nin a glade or a tent.

And I had forgotten to do one thing, but could  <br/>\nstill send it up with Marty, and, and...<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty was sitting at his computer, in the time before he needed to  <br/>\nleave for work.  I went up and held his head gently from behind and  <br/>\nsmelled his hair.  He might have felt it as a gesture of soothing  <br/>\naffection, but it was a self-therapeutic move on my part.  Smelling  <br/>\nhis hair gave me the mom-emotions that helped me be grateful for the  <br/>\nwhole thing instead of feeling put-upon and pressured.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrior to that, when Marty came in the house after Keith (outside  <br/>\npacking the truck) had been impolite, Marty said &quot;He still loves you&quot;  <br/>\nand smiled really big.

Seriously.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would be surprised if your children weren&#39;t feeling your stress. <br/>\nEven infants feel and respond to their mother&#39;s stress.  I know my son<br/>\nhas since he was an infant.  When I am feeling overly stressed and my<br/>\nson begins to show signs of stress too (he&#39;s only 2, so that means<br/>\nquicker to cry), I stop everything in that moment, kneel down to his<br/>\nlevel, and embrace him in a good hug.  It&#39;s amazing how good it feels<br/>\nto feel those little arms wrapped around my neck and those little<br/>\nhands holding tight; sometimes he even pats my shoulder.  Both of us<br/>\nimmediately feel a little dissolution of our stress together, and we<br/>\nare better able to move forward with our day.  The source of the<br/>\nstress hasn&#39;t been removed, but I feel better equipped to cope and<br/>\ndeal for the time being, and my son seems reassured that everything&#39;s<br/>\nokay.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, literally, stop and smell your children, and embrace them in a<br/>\nhug.  I don&#39;t know how old or young your children are, but I would<br/>\nalso suggest talking to them and letting them know too that everything<br/>\nwill be okay.  They need to know that, especially because they do feel<br/>\nyour stress.  I remember being as young as 5 or 6 and becoming very<br/>\nanxious and worried any time my mom was hurt or upset.  I remember<br/>\nthinking, &quot;you&#39;re my mom, I need you, please be okay&quot;.

Sometimes I&#39;ve gone weekly for a month or two  <br/>\nwhen I was feeling depressed or overwhelmed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I&#39;ve done is when I was frazzled I&#39;d ask friends to  <br/>\ntake my kids to do something.  Some all-day thing, or an  <br/>\novernighter.  And I would use that time to breathe and think and plan  <br/>\nhow to fit everything in.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-It seems like the children need me more than usual lately.
