That old, wind-up 8 millimeter camera that was in your drawer?&quot; And he goes, &quot;Sure, take it.&quot; And I took it and I started making movies with it and I started being as creative as I could, and never once in my life did my parents ever say, &quot;What you&#39;re doing is a waste of time.&quot; Never. And I grew up, I had teachers, I had colleagues, I had people that I worked with all through my life who always told me what you&#39;re doing is not a waste of time. So that was normal to me that it was OK to do that. I know there are kids out there that don&#39;t have that support system so if you&#39;re out there and you&#39;re listening, listen to me: If you want to be creative, get out there and do it. It&#39;s not a waste of time. Do it. OK? Thank you. Thank you.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI think there might be something very special about the working culture over at Pixar, the kind of people they attract.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
