Using an intimate journalized style, her book, <br/>\nHomeschooling Reflections, provides a peek into the lives of her homeschooling family of <br/>\nfive children over two decades. It is riveting reading as she recounts <br/>\nthe fear, anxiety, joy, sorrow, and ultimately the celebrations of self-discovery <br/>\nand self-directed learning when day-to-day life and education are naturally <br/>\nentwined. This book provides an exceptional look at the constantly changing lives, <br/>\ninterests, and needs of a growing homeschool family. Read Homeschooling <br/>\nReflections and you&#39;ll rest assured that you too, can successfully homeschool your <br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n <br/>\nDiane Flynn Keith<br/>\nAuthor of Carschooling, &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.carschooling.com/&quot;\">http://www.carschooling.com/&quot;</a>&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.carschooling.com/&lt;/A\">http://www.carschooling.com/&lt;/A</a>&gt;<br/>\nEditor of Homefires~The Journal of Homeschooling Online, &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homefires.com/&quot;\">http://www.homefires.com/&quot;</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homefires.com/&lt;/A\">http://www.homefires.com/&lt;/A</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">    &gt; &gt;&gt; This book has something others miss:  the changes that take place in <br/>\n&gt;&gt; a parent    who lives consciously and mindfully with children.  Natural <br/>\n&gt;&gt; learning is quite different from &quot;school at home,&quot; and can be hard to explain or <br/>\n&gt;&gt; imagine.   It comes not from &quot;what to do&quot; stories, but from considerations <br/>\n&gt;&gt; of how to live.  Not all homeschoolers have models and mentors, but this <br/>\n&gt;&gt; book can be the next best thing.  Not only are the Coltens&#39; lives shared, but <br/>\n&gt;&gt; other homeschooling families have offered glimpses of their own herein as <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ....  Sandra Dodd, unschooling advocate, SandraDodd.com/unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Connie Colton has bravely poured out her heart about her family life <br/>\nhomeschooling. As with many families, homeschooling for the Colton&#39;s <br/>\nmakes sense as they move often as a Military family. She tells us about <br/>\nroutine and special days, and how she, like many of us, become more <br/>\nradical homeschoolers when threatening incidents occur, and it becomes <br/>\nnecessary to be part of The Movement to affect political changes. The <br/>\nbook reads like a blog, or online journal, though the messages are <br/>\nsorted into logical topics. This is a rather new form of written <br/>\nexpression, which I think you will find refreshing and enjoyable.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnn Zeise<br/>\nA to Z Home&#39;s Cool<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gomilpitas.com/homeschooling\">http://www.gomilpitas.com/homeschooling</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe webpage is the only location for purchase of the book.
