She&#39;d scream in the  <br/>\nbath, so I would give her sponge baths only. As she got older, she  <br/>\ngradually got more comfortable and would have baths (sometimes 3 or 4  <br/>\na day &lt;g&gt;) and liked warm pools, but would not go under the water. She  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t like the water in her eyes. But at about age 6, I offered  <br/>\nlessons and she thought she&#39;d like to take them because her  <br/>\nhomeschooling friends were going to be there.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the first things the instructor had the kids in the class do  <br/>\nwas put their faces in the water. That was not going to fly with  <br/>\nMichelle and she balked, soon dissolving into defensiveness and tears.  <br/>\nI was right there and asked her if she wanted to stop. She said yes,  <br/>\nso I took her out to the other, non-lesson pool. The instructor came  <br/>\nover to me to say that Michelle *had* to put her face in the water to  <br/>\ncontinue in the lessons and &quot;learn to swim&quot;. I told her Michelle  <br/>\nwanted to be happy in the water and if she was currently afraid to put  <br/>\nher face in the water, I was not going to make her do it. The  <br/>\ninstructor shrugged and went back to the class.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe tried a couple more sessions, provided at private home pools, but  <br/>\nwe bailed out of those, too. Instead, whenever we traveled, we&#39;d find  <br/>\na hotel with a pool. We&#39;d spend lots of time in the water with her,  <br/>\njust playing, using floatie things. We bought her a swim mask (the  <br/>\nkind you use to go snorkeling) and she soon went happily underwater  <br/>\nwith it.  Since then, she&#39;s been like a little fish and can&#39;t wait to  <br/>\nget into a pool. She still uses her mask, still likes floatie things  <br/>\nat 13.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took patience, opportunity and the enjoyment of wherever she was in  <br/>\nher swimming journey.

She got angry that he was swimming instead of<br/>\nlistening to instructions, so she threw him out of the class. I love being<br/>\nable to say that he got thrown out of swim class for swimming too much. =)<br/>\nAnd even at that stage, Rowan got how completely ridiculous the whole<br/>\nsituation was. What&#39;s funny is that Jason and I were totally proud of him<br/>\nfor the swimming he was doing, and the parents on the bleachers around us<br/>\nwere seriously encouraging us to reprimand him and &quot;make him go back into<br/>\nclass.&quot; Um... if the point is to teach him to swim, and he&#39;s swimming, then<br/>\nwhat&#39;s the point? Oh yeah. Compliance.
