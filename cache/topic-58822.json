My parents never pushed me like What Amy did. Instead, I was pushing myself. I was pushing myself so I didn&#39;t need to face my parents&#39; disappointment. The pressure was the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe results:<br/>\n<br/>\nI was accepted by the most competitive and prestigious university in China and I was one of the 15 students chosen from the province of 60 millions population.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt that time, in China (still true today), getting a college degree was a matter of life or death for one&#39;s life. And the annual college entrance exam was the only goal for all children as far as schooling was concerned.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor that goal, I had been following a routine like this: get up at 5am and sleep at 10pm everyday for ten some years. Study, study and study.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn school, we studied for the purpose of THE Exam down the road (college entrance exam). Any books other than textbooks were discouraged because only content that would be tested had meaning. The strategy was that you had done testing so many times that you should be able to &quot;know the answer&quot; right away.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the real results:<br/>\n1. I had false self-confidence. <br/>\n<br/>\n2. I am afraid of failures. I didn&#39;t like to try anything that I didn&#39;t feel I would &quot;succeed&quot; (no matter what it means)<br/>\n<br/>\n3. I had a very narrow &quot;knowledge base&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. I only had &quot;textbook knowledge&quot;. I didn&#39;t know how to apply to real life. In my middle school physics class, I could solve any problem about pulley. But I had never seen one in real life until a year ago when I installed pulleys on a play house for my children.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. I only had one way of learning: linear (from start to end), following instruction...by comparison, my children have so many ways of learning <br/>\n<br/>\n6.When I graduated from university, the only applicable skill I had for working on a real job was my typing skill.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. I constantly seek validation and approval. Also I look for the &quot;right answer&quot; (those multichoice questions did the trick to condition my brain)<br/>\n<br/>\n8. I focused on end results instead of processes.<br/>\n<br/>\n......<br/>\n<br/>\nSo having been on &quot;the other side&quot;, I am not impressed by or interested in Amy Chua&#39;s Chinese way at all. Let them be the doctors, whom I am not going to see; or lawyers, whom I don&#39;t think I would trust (street smart is more important)<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, I think the unschooling way is superior:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. produce happy children<br/>\nsave them from being lost in their life, soul searching for many years and seeing psychiatrist.<br/>\n<br/>\nSacrificing our children&#39;s childhood (only 12 or 15 years) for adulthood? not a good plan. <br/>\n<br/>\n2. Relationship lasts for a long time while &quot;preparing for the future&quot; only lasts for a short period of time.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Just-in-time learning is better than just-in-case learning<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Passion driven pursuit can turn hard working into enjoyment instead of suffering<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Freedom <br/>\n<br/>\n6. More adaptable<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Creativity and originality are the most important competitive advantages in a more and more flattened world.<br/>\n<br/>\n8. Collaboration is more important than competition <br/>\n<br/>\n9. Communication/social skills are must-haves for the future<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd...by the time they turn 18, we will already have 18 years happy and fulfilling life...we are 18 years ahead of them. They may not be happy by the time they have achieved all their &quot;goals&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI vote for unschooling for its superiority. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":413967925,"authorName":"Bea","from":"&quot;Bea&quot; &lt;beatrice.mantovani@...&gt;","profile":"bmantovani","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: the other side","postDate":"1295101222","msgId":58940,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlnc2FmNitsMG1hQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlnYWdtZiticHNlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58871,"nextInTopic":58947,"prevInTime":58939,"nextInTime":58941,"topicId":58822,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There is a follow up article here: http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/fashion/16Cultural.html?ref=homepage&src=me&pagewanted=all Here is my favorite quote: She","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-872154470\">There is a follow up article here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/fashion/16Cultural.html?ref=homepage&src=me&pagewanted=all\">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/fashion/16Cultural.html?ref=homepage&src=me&pagewanted=all</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHere is my favorite quote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;She confesses in her book that she is &quot;not good at enjoying life,&quot; and that she wasn&#39;t naturally curious or skeptical like other law students. &quot;I just wanted to write down everything the professor said and memorize it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was determined to raise her daughters the way she and her three sisters had been raised  which, she said, left them adoring their parents.

In  <br/>\norder to successfully know how to play piano, asians must know how to  <br/>\nread both the treble and bass clefs. That means understanding the  <br/>\nintricacies of a whole other language at the ripe age of 3, which in  <br/>\nturn, allows most asian children to comprehend how to efficiently use  <br/>\ntheir left and right brain hemispheres at an earlier age. Do you ever  <br/>\nwonder why asian children are so gifted mathematically and spatially?  <br/>\nThat’s your answer. Asians will also enroll their children in musical  <br/>\nclasses to serve the community.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Asian-Christian families, the ability to play piano means that the  <br/>\nchild can have his or her turn at ‘performing” during church  <br/>\nservices. That way, Mrs. Chung can brag (more on bragging below) to  <br/>\neveryone that it’s her Jenny out there playing ‘”˜Praise My  <br/>\nSoul’ like an angel.” The accolades don’t end in the  <br/>\ncongregation hall. That’s why pianos are, most importantly,  <br/>\nexpensive. To have one in the living room is a subtle (in an asian  <br/>\nsense) way of telling everyone that the Asians are keeping up with the  <br/>\n‘Joneses” (or the Wongs).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn asian circles, piano is the choice instrument, followed very  <br/>\nclosely by the violin. The violin is often a preference because it’s  <br/>\nsmall and portable, great for young children. Asian kids start private  <br/>\nmusic lessons as kindergarteners (before they start learning how to  <br/>\nuse chopsticks, but after they start their introductory calculus  <br/>\nlessons), or even while in pre-school (I had my first piano lesson  <br/>\njust before my 4th birthday)! The sound it makes is very soft and  <br/>\nsmooth when playing strictly classical music (a proper Asian kid does  <br/>\nNOT fiddle). The violin, like piano, is also more likely to be a  <br/>\n‘star” instrument, which will more times than none draw more  <br/>\nattention to the child’s parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo Conservative Asians, most other instruments are a no-no. Especially  <br/>\nbrass instruments and instruments associated with bands and more  <br/>\npopular music. To Asian parents, instruments such as trombones,  <br/>\nsaxophones, trumpets, percussive drums, guitar (especially ELECTRIC  <br/>\nGUITAR) are blasphemous. Asian parents don’t want their child to risk  <br/>\nbecoming evil rock musicians! Asian kids must be proper. They must be  <br/>\nable to play the kind of music that can be heard at church or when  <br/>\nfamily friends visit. They must be able to read at a 5thgrade level  <br/>\nbefore they are potty-trained. And most importantly, they must learn  <br/>\nhow to haggle with other children when trading lunches in order to  <br/>\nachieve the most economical utility.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote from Author: Acceptable instruments other than piano and violin  <br/>\ninclude: flute, clarinet, oboe, cello (only after Yo-Yo Ma became a  <br/>\nbig star), and vocal ensembles. (At my middle and high schools, the  <br/>\nflute sections at ensembles were overwhelmingly Asian while brass  <br/>\ninstruments were white.) The guitar is allowed after the age of 18,  <br/>\nwhen children are legal adults and want to play sad songs about how  <br/>\nthe girl in Multi-Quantum Physics isn’t digging their outfit or  <br/>\naccepting their invitations to buy boba (but let’s save that for a  <br/>\nlater post).<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: the other side","postDate":"1294676814","msgId":58865,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ3NDE0RTZFLTZFOTMtNDJDRS04NTE4LTQ5MTU1NEE0RTU2M0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEVDNzIyOUNBRjJCQzRERkRCQzIzQTlBQTJBNENCRUY2QEVkUEM+","referencesHeader":"PGExNzk3LjRkOTNhMWU4LjNhNWIwMzg0QGFvbC5jb20+IDxEMjc1NjE5Q0MwMUM0RkVEOUNGNUQ1RDE1QzYxNkIwMEBFZFBDPiA8NThGMkQ0MDctQjc4OC00MjZBLTlCMTUtNEI1RjU0MzM1OUVCQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8RUM3MjI5Q0FGMkJDNERGREJDMjNBOUFBMkE0Q0JFRjZARWRQQz4="},"prevInTopic":58864,"nextInTopic":58868,"prevInTime":58864,"nextInTime":58866,"topicId":58822,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-The part I don t understand is why violin and piano and absolutely no other instrument?

She wrote an essay on the clitorectomy she was forced to undergo as a young child. I know it is culturally accepted in many countries to maim female children in this way so that they will make &quot;successful&quot; wives. I&#39;m sure it works. But it doesn&#39;t make it right or healthy and probably destroys pleasure in marriage for both husband and wife who never even conceive what lovemaking can be when it is mutually enjoyed. <br/>\n<br/>\nAmy Chuan&#39;s idea of forcing success down her children&#39;s throats for their own good is not much different in my view than an enforced clitorectomy. Her concept of success is entirely about pecuniary and social valuations it has nothing to do with the inner life of her children. Obedience and rote learning can only achieve so much.  If what the writer says is true about most Chinese American families, I don&#39;t think I will ever be able to look at one of these paragons of academic perfection again without a deep sense of pity and visceral distrust in their ability to think for themselves or make judgments not centered on their own &quot;success&quot; or fear of humiliation. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am more than ever glad that I discovered unschooling and I feel more than ever ashamed of the few times I did say mean things to my own child to shame her when I was still caught up in the idea that the only way one can succeed is to do well in school.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":143043046,"authorName":"Ed Wendell","from":"&quot;Ed Wendell&quot; &lt;ewendell@...&gt;","profile":"zelco123","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: the other side","postDate":"1294593677","msgId":58832,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQyNzU2MTlDQzAxQzRGRUQ5Q0Y1RDVEMTVDNjE2QjAwQEVkUEM+","inReplyToHeader":"PGExNzk3LjRkOTNhMWU4LjNhNWIwMzg0QGFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGExNzk3LjRkOTNhMWU4LjNhNWIwMzg0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":58828,"nextInTopic":58833,"prevInTime":58831,"nextInTime":58833,"topicId":58822,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"* Linnaea, who read the article with me, thinks they won t be the happiest of adults.

Someone long ago invented the violin and piano ;)  but what about electricity, computers, automobiles, stoves, blow-dryers, clothing/fabrics, bridges, roads, ???  What about their teachers?  They obviously take lessons.  OH what about the composers - very creative people.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess you need a lot of doctors - especially psychiatrists - in their world !<br/>\n<br/>\nI read she is a Yale Law professor and author of a few books so I googled her and read some of her &quot;history&quot; - WOW - it really gave perspective to her roots and how she could be this way with her children and so snooty towards &quot;Western parents&quot;.  She was  born in the Philippines to Chinese parents.  The Chinese are a minority group in the Philippines but are the wealthiest group with the indigenous people being the poor working class / servants.  The wealthy Chinese see the indigenous group as lazy and stupid.  Her Aunt treated her servants so poorly that they slept on dirt floors, she belittled them, etc. to the point that her chauffer slit her throat.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nZachariah is 16 and he has decided to take violin lessons.  We have his great, great grandfather&#39;s violin.  We just got a call from the repair shop that it is refurbished and ready to play so he will begin lessons this week.  He made this decision all on his own at 16.  He came up to us about 3 weeks ago with the violin in hand and said &quot;I&#39;d like to take violin lessons if possible.&quot;  I found a local shop that sells, leases, and repairs.  Took the violin in for it to be looked at and was reassured that the investment in repairing it was worth the money vs. leasing or buying new.  He may take a few lessons and that is it or he may go further - who knows???<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve offered violin lessons before - as we had the violin.  We&#39;ve offered guitar lessons too as we have a guitar.  He always said he was not interested.  However he did take HapKiDo for 5 years until he was within two months of testing for his black belt.  He wanted to quit, so he quit.  He has taken fencing lessons; played basketball and volleyball; taken Parkour at a gymnastics facility, horse back riding lessons for several years (still does)  played Magic the Gathering off and on for 6-7 years (currently playing).  He had a job at the local pet shop for a year working one afternoon/evening a week - age 14.5 - 15.5  then got laid off due to &quot;economic times&quot;.  He has also participated in a host of classes such as drawing, pottery, photography, stop motion film, Japanese language, science,  - too many to remember.  The classes are offered as a co-op through our local homeschool group.  Mostly it is an opportunity to get together with other people and do something fun.  He has done various volunteer work at the local food pantry, planted trees in parks for Arbor Day and helped build a house for Habitat for Humanity as well as water the horses at the stable one summer.  OH and he took a couple of classes on making chainmail - the list could go on and on.   He has figured out with a bit of help from his dad how to make wooden swords - replicas of real swords he researches as well as ones he designs.  He did this about 3-4 years ago and just this week started again.  And last night I showed him how to tell if the macaroni noodles are done :) <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, he has had a very wide range of experiences in life as well as TV, movies, films, games, books, etc.  and he is still choosing to expand his horizons.  Not because someone told him to, nor to please someone else, but because he chooses to for his own self.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] the other side","postDate":"1294576489","msgId":58827,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVGNUNFRkQ3LTFFODMtNDcxRi04OUJBLTUyNkY2QzYyNTlDMEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlnYWdtZiticHNlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlnYWdtZiticHNlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58826,"nextInTopic":58828,"prevInTime":58826,"nextInTime":58828,"topicId":58822,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The other other side is from the point of view of a Chinese child who hasn t graduated into the lofty realm of power wielder over a child.

She is all about her children&#39;s future, all about <br/>\nensuring that they have some kind of place in a highly competitive world. She <br/>\nmentions in the story about Lulu learning The Little White Donkey that parents <br/>\ncame up to her and praised the match of Lulu to the piece. Even though it didn&#39;t <br/>\nseem to be part of her aim, this melding of personality to piece as it was a <br/>\npiece that her not very individual older daughter Sophia had mastered at the <br/>\nsame age. So there is something very big about her own sense of self as a parent <br/>\ninvolved in her daughter&#39;s success. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut mainly what struck me was that I have no sense of Simon&#39;s or Linnaea&#39;s <br/>\nfuture.

I&#39;m <br/>\nguessing that they won&#39;t strive in the same way that Amy Chua&#39;s daughters will <br/>\nstrive. They won&#39;t be seeking to crush the competition under their heels, they <br/>\nwon&#39;t be working to achieve the next medal or stamp of approval or whatever it <br/>\nis that lets them feel good and skilled enough to cuddle up with their mom and <br/>\ngiggle. I&#39;m guessing that they will do the things that they want to do and do <br/>\nthe things that interest them without looking so much for external rewards, <br/>\nbecause they know how to feel good without those rewards already. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy Chua believes that what she is doing will prepare her children to do well in <br/>\nthe future, to excel against any odds, to know they are capable of surmounting <br/>\nany challenge that they encounter.

I have no sense that the <br/>\nfuture will be the same as the now, not that I think the end is nigh or that the <br/>\nworld will be radically different in 10 years than it is now. But I don&#39;t know <br/>\nwhat they will want to do with their lives when they aren&#39;t so overlapping with <br/>\nmy life.

And what happens when they fight back?<br/>\n<br/>\nBy AMY CHUA<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of people wonder how Chinese parents raise such stereotypically successful kids. They wonder what these parents do to produce so many math whizzes and music prodigies, what it&#39;s like inside the family, and whether they could do it too. Well, I can tell them, because I&#39;ve done it. Here are some things my daughters, Sophia and Louisa, were never allowed to do:<br/>\n<br/>\nView Full Image<br/>\n<br/>\nErin Patrice O&#39;Brien for The Wall Street Journal<br/>\nAmy Chua with her daughters, Louisa and Sophia, at their home in New Haven, Conn.<br/>\n<br/>\n attend a sleepover<br/>\n<br/>\n have a playdate<br/>\n<br/>\n be in a school play<br/>\n<br/>\n complain about not being in a school play<br/>\n<br/>\n watch TV or play computer games<br/>\n<br/>\n choose their own extracurricular activities<br/>\n<br/>\n get any grade less than an A<br/>\n<br/>\n not be the No. 1 student in every subject except gym and drama<br/>\n<br/>\n play any instrument other than the piano or violin<br/>\n<br/>\n not play the piano or violin.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m using the term &quot;Chinese mother&quot; loosely. I know some Korean, Indian, Jamaican, Irish and Ghanaian parents who qualify too. Conversely, I know some mothers of Chinese heritage, almost always born in the West, who are not Chinese mothers, by choice or otherwise. I&#39;m also using the term &quot;Western parents&quot; loosely. Western parents come in all varieties.<br/>\n<br/>\nView Full Image<br/>\n<br/>\nChua family<br/>\nFrom Ms. Chua&#39;s album: &#39;Mean me with Lulu in hotel room... with score taped to TV!&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the same, even when Western parents think they&#39;re being strict, they usually don&#39;t come close to being Chinese mothers. For example, my Western friends who consider themselves strict make their children practice their instruments 30 minutes every day. An hour at most. For a Chinese mother, the first hour is the easy part. It&#39;s hours two and three that get tough.<br/>\n<br/>\nDespite our squeamishness about cultural stereotypes, there are tons of studies out there showing marked and quantifiable differences between Chinese and Westerners when it comes to parenting. In one study of 50 Western American mothers and 48 Chinese immigrant mothers, almost 70% of the Western mothers said either that &quot;stressing academic success is not good for children&quot; or that &quot;parents need to foster the idea that learning is fun.&quot; By contrast, roughly 0% of the Chinese mothers felt the same way. Instead, the vast majority of the Chinese mothers said that they believe their children can be &quot;the best&quot; students, that &quot;academic achievement reflects successful parenting,&quot; and that if children did not excel at school then there was &quot;a problem&quot; and parents &quot;were not doing their job.&quot; Other studies indicate that compared to Western parents, Chinese parents spend approximately 10 times as long every day drilling academic activities with their children. By contrast, Western kids are more likely to participate in sports teams.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it comes to parenting, the Chinese seem to produce children who display academic excellence, musical mastery and professional success - or so the stereotype goes. WSJ&#39;s Christina Tsuei speaks to two moms raised by Chinese immigrants who share what it was like growing up and how they hope to raise their children.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore Parenting Videos<br/>\n<br/>\nTeaching Math to Spark Creative Thinking<br/>\n<br/>\nCan Bilingualism Make Preschoolers Smarter?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat Chinese parents understand is that nothing is fun until you&#39;re good at it. To get good at anything you have to work, and children on their own never want to work, which is why it is crucial to override their preferences. This often requires fortitude on the part of the parents because the child will resist; things are always hardest at the beginning, which is where Western parents tend to give up. But if done properly, the Chinese strategy produces a virtuous circle. Tenacious practice, practice, practice is crucial for excellence; rote repetition is underrated in America. Once a child starts to excel at somethingwhether it&#39;s math, piano, pitching or ballethe or she gets praise, admiration and satisfaction. This builds confidence and makes the once not-fun activity fun. This in turn makes it easier for the parent to get the child to work even more.<br/>\n<br/>\nChinese parents can get away with things that Western parents can&#39;t. Once when I was youngmaybe more than oncewhen I was extremely disrespectful to my mother, my father angrily called me &quot;garbage&quot; in our native Hokkien dialect. It worked really well. I felt terrible and deeply ashamed of what I had done. But it didn&#39;t damage my self-esteem or anything like that. I knew exactly how highly he thought of me. I didn&#39;t actually think I was worthless or feel like a piece of garbage.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an adult, I once did the same thing to Sophia, calling her garbage in English when she acted extremely disrespectfully toward me. When I mentioned that I had done this at a dinner party, I was immediately ostracized. One guest named Marcy got so upset she broke down in tears and had to leave early. My friend Susan, the host, tried to rehabilitate me with the remaining guests.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact is that Chinese parents can do things that would seem unimaginableeven legally actionableto Westerners. Chinese mothers can say to their daughters, &quot;Hey fattylose some weight.&quot; By contrast, Western parents have to tiptoe around the issue, talking in terms of &quot;health&quot; and never ever mentioning the f-word, and their kids still end up in therapy for eating disorders and negative self-image. (I also once heard a Western father toast his adult daughter by calling her &quot;beautiful and incredibly competent.&quot; She later told me that made her feel like garbage.)<br/>\n<br/>\nChinese parents can order their kids to get straight As. Western parents can only ask their kids to try their best. Chinese parents can say, &quot;You&#39;re lazy. All your classmates are getting ahead of you.&quot; By contrast, Western parents have to struggle with their own conflicted feelings about achievement, and try to persuade themselves that they&#39;re not disappointed about how their kids turned out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve thought long and hard about how Chinese parents can get away with what they do. I think there are three big differences between the Chinese and Western parental mind-sets.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChua family<br/>\nNewborn Amy Chua in her mother&#39;s arms, a year after her parents arrived in the U.S.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeigh in<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy Chua will answer readers&#39; questions Thursday on Review&#39;s new blog, Ideas Market.<br/>\n<br/>\nWrite to: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:IdeasMarket@...\">IdeasMarket@...</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I&#39;ve noticed that Western parents are extremely anxious about their children&#39;s self-esteem. They worry about how their children will feel if they fail at something, and they constantly try to reassure their children about how good they are notwithstanding a mediocre performance on a test or at a recital. In other words, Western parents are concerned about their children&#39;s psyches. Chinese parents aren&#39;t. They assume strength, not fragility, and as a result they behave very differently.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, if a child comes home with an A-minus on a test, a Western parent will most likely praise the child. The Chinese mother will gasp in horror and ask what went wrong. If the child comes home with a B on the test, some Western parents will still praise the child. Other Western parents will sit their child down and express disapproval, but they will be careful not to make their child feel inadequate or insecure, and they will not call their child &quot;stupid,&quot; &quot;worthless&quot; or &quot;a disgrace.&quot; Privately, the Western parents may worry that their child does not test well or have aptitude in the subject or that there is something wrong with the curriculum and possibly the whole school. If the child&#39;s grades do not improve, they may eventually schedule a meeting with the school principal to challenge the way the subject is being taught or to call into question the teacher&#39;s credentials.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a Chinese child gets a Bwhich would never happenthere would first be a screaming, hair-tearing explosion. The devastated Chinese mother would then get dozens, maybe hundreds of practice tests and work through them with her child for as long as it takes to get the grade up to an A.<br/>\n<br/>\nChinese parents demand perfect grades because they believe that their child can get them. If their child doesn&#39;t get them, the Chinese parent assumes it&#39;s because the child didn&#39;t work hard enough. That&#39;s why the solution to substandard performance is always to excoriate, punish and shame the child. The Chinese parent believes that their child will be strong enough to take the shaming and to improve from it. (And when Chinese kids do excel, there is plenty of ego-inflating parental praise lavished in the privacy of the home.)<br/>\n<br/>\nView Full Image<br/>\n<br/>\nChua family<br/>\nSophia playing at Carnegie Hall in 2007.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, Chinese parents believe that their kids owe them everything. The reason for this is a little unclear, but it&#39;s probably a combination of Confucian filial piety and the fact that the parents have sacrificed and done so much for their children. (And it&#39;s true that Chinese mothers get in the trenches, putting in long grueling hours personally tutoring, training, interrogating and spying on their kids.) Anyway, the understanding is that Chinese children must spend their lives repaying their parents by obeying them and making them proud.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy contrast, I don&#39;t think most Westerners have the same view of children being permanently indebted to their parents. My husband, Jed, actually has the opposite view. &quot;Children don&#39;t choose their parents,&quot; he once said to me. &quot;They don&#39;t even choose to be born. It&#39;s parents who foist life on their kids, so it&#39;s the parents&#39; responsibility to provide for them. Kids don&#39;t owe their parents anything. Their duty will be to their own kids.&quot; This strikes me as a terrible deal for the Western parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, Chinese parents believe that they know what is best for their children and therefore override all of their children&#39;s own desires and preferences. That&#39;s why Chinese daughters can&#39;t have boyfriends in high school and why Chinese kids can&#39;t go to sleepaway camp. It&#39;s also why no Chinese kid would ever dare say to their mother, &quot;I got a part in the school play! I&#39;m Villager Number Six. I&#39;ll have to stay after school for rehearsal every day from 3:00 to 7:00, and I&#39;ll also need a ride on weekends.&quot; God help any Chinese kid who tried that one.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t get me wrong: It&#39;s not that Chinese parents don&#39;t care about their children. Just the opposite. They would give up anything for their children. It&#39;s just an entirely different parenting model.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a story in favor of coercion, Chinese-style. Lulu was about 7, still playing two instruments, and working on a piano piece called &quot;The Little White Donkey&quot; by the French composer Jacques Ibert. The piece is really cuteyou can just imagine a little donkey ambling along a country road with its masterbut it&#39;s also incredibly difficult for young players because the two hands have to keep schizophrenically different rhythms.<br/>\n<br/>\nLulu couldn&#39;t do it. We worked on it nonstop for a week, drilling each of her hands separately, over and over. But whenever we tried putting the hands together, one always morphed into the other, and everything fell apart. Finally, the day before her lesson, Lulu announced in exasperation that she was giving up and stomped off.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Get back to the piano now,&quot; I ordered.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You can&#39;t make me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Oh yes, I can.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBack at the piano, Lulu made me pay. She punched, thrashed and kicked. She grabbed the music score and tore it to shreds. I taped the score back together and encased it in a plastic shield so that it could never be destroyed again. Then I hauled Lulu&#39;s dollhouse to the car and told her I&#39;d donate it to the Salvation Army piece by piece if she didn&#39;t have &quot;The Little White Donkey&quot; perfect by the next day. When Lulu said, &quot;I thought you were going to the Salvation Army, why are you still here?&quot; I threatened her with no lunch, no dinner, no Christmas or Hanukkah presents, no birthday parties for two, three, four years. When she still kept playing it wrong, I told her she was purposely working herself into a frenzy because she was secretly afraid she couldn&#39;t do it. I told her to stop being lazy, cowardly, self-indulgent and pathetic.<br/>\n<br/>\nJed took me aside. He told me to stop insulting Luluwhich I wasn&#39;t even doing, I was just motivating herand that he didn&#39;t think threatening Lulu was helpful. Also, he said, maybe Lulu really just couldn&#39;t do the techniqueperhaps she didn&#39;t have the coordination yethad I considered that possibility?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You just don&#39;t believe in her,&quot; I accused.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;That&#39;s ridiculous,&quot; Jed said scornfully. &quot;Of course I do.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Sophia could play the piece when she was this age.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But Lulu and Sophia are different people,&quot; Jed pointed out.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Oh no, not this,&quot; I said, rolling my eyes. &quot;Everyone is special in their special own way,&quot; I mimicked sarcastically. &quot;Even losers are special in their own special way. Well don&#39;t worry, you don&#39;t have to lift a finger. I&#39;m willing to put in as long as it takes, and I&#39;m happy to be the one hated. And you can be the one they adore because you make them pancakes and take them to Yankees games.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI rolled up my sleeves and went back to Lulu. I used every weapon and tactic I could think of. We worked right through dinner into the night, and I wouldn&#39;t let Lulu get up, not for water, not even to go to the bathroom. The house became a war zone, and I lost my voice yelling, but still there seemed to be only negative progress, and even I began to have doubts.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, out of the blue, Lulu did it. Her hands suddenly came togetherher right and left hands each doing their own imperturbable thingjust like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nRead More<br/>\n<br/>\nIn China, Not All Practice Tough Love<br/>\nThe Juggle: Are U.S. Parents Too Soft?<br/>\nLulu realized it the same time I did. I held my breath. She tried it tentatively again. Then she played it more confidently and faster, and still the rhythm held. A moment later, she was beaming.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Mommy, lookit&#39;s easy!&quot; After that, she wanted to play the piece over and over and wouldn&#39;t leave the piano. That night, she came to sleep in my bed, and we snuggled and hugged, cracking each other up. When she performed &quot;The Little White Donkey&quot; at a recital a few weeks later, parents came up to me and said, &quot;What a perfect piece for Luluit&#39;s so spunky and so her.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEven Jed gave me credit for that one. Western parents worry a lot about their children&#39;s self-esteem. But as a parent, one of the worst things you can do for your child&#39;s self-esteem is to let them give up. On the flip side, there&#39;s nothing better for building confidence than learning you can do something you thought you couldn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are all these new books out there portraying Asian mothers as scheming, callous, overdriven people indifferent to their kids&#39; true interests. For their part, many Chinese secretly believe that they care more about their children and are willing to sacrifice much more for them than Westerners, who seem perfectly content to let their children turn out badly. I think it&#39;s a misunderstanding on both sides. All decent parents want to do what&#39;s best for their children. The Chinese just have a totally different idea of how to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWestern parents try to respect their children&#39;s individuality, encouraging them to pursue their true passions, supporting their choices, and providing positive reinforcement and a nurturing environment. By contrast, the Chinese believe that the best way to protect their children is by preparing them for the future, letting them see what they&#39;re capable of, and arming them with skills, work habits and inner confidence that no one can ever take away.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy Chua is a professor at Yale Law School and author of &quot;Day of Empire&quot; and &quot;World on Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability.&quot; This essay is excerpted from &quot;Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother&quot; by Amy Chua, to be published Tuesday by the Penguin Press, a member of Penguin Group (USA) Inc.
