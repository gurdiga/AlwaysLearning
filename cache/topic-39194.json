Many parents want *more* control not less.  Video games<br/>\ndon&#39;t provide that.  In their thinking, video games come right between them<br/>\nand their children.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome might see video gaming as a cultural void, which many people don&#39;t see<br/>\nas viably filled up if it&#39;s the young and inexperienced who are doing the<br/>\nfilling up of it.  Well, it&#39;s make believe right?  There have probably<br/>\nalways been people who worry about children being too imaginative or out in<br/>\nspace, with not enough focus on reality.  They might also worry about kids<br/>\ngetting the idea that fantasy is real or that they have the ability to make<br/>\ntheir crazy stories reality.  Video games play into a lot of feelings like<br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nOut of their depth, parents might also feel they&#39;re rapidly losing ground.<br/>\nFor some, there&#39;s a fear that the basic structure of video games is<br/>\nmind-altering in some insidious, subversive or evil way.  Somebody in<br/>\ncomputer programming unknown to the parents --who might not even be parents<br/>\nthemselves-- developed the game.  The parents don&#39;t know who these people<br/>\nare.  This could be a valid fear when we consider that school is very<br/>\nsystematic and channels people a certain way.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy opinion is that the best protective measure (where we see a need for it)<br/>\nis to enable children to move through and critically assess their world as<br/>\nindependently as possible at an early age.  People (even children) who are<br/>\nagents in decision-making are much more difficult to stupefy or program or<br/>\nmess with.  Some of the benefits:  The sooner children realize that they<br/>\nsometimes make fouled up decisions, the more realistically they are able to<br/>\nlearn from them.  Also the younger a person is, the less damaging the<br/>\ndecisions in play are likely to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople who think they&#39;re breaking the rules to think unconventionally or<br/>\nmake their own decisions are easily pushed/rushed into letting others make<br/>\ndecisions for them.  In most modern wars, the first people to protest, take<br/>\nsocial action and/or go into exile were the free thinkers.  They wouldn&#39;t go<br/>\nalong with the program.  They objected and asked sticky questions.  Many of<br/>\nthese people were independently educated.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst we want to be able to see our children primarily as people with the<br/>\ncapacity to make important decisions.  (Not saying that children can make<br/>\nall the important decisions or that they exist in some vacuum where the<br/>\nparents offer no help.)  That&#39;s simple.  It&#39;s doable.  Unschoolers are doing<br/>\nthat!  Many people can&#39;t say that and it&#39;s scary for some of them to hear<br/>\nabout parents who *can* say it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a Christian, may I say one could, if so inclined, take the above and<br/>\nmultiply by an extra percentage of relevance, and see a much bigger<br/>\ndisconnection than secular people do in video games.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 10/7/08, Kelly Lovejoy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n    &quot;Online fantasy worlds may seem too disconnected from real life to have<br/>\neducational value,... &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n    -=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n    That&#39;s a quote from the article that Kelli and Jill were quoted in.<br/>\n<br/>\n    OK, so how does that &quot;disconnection&quot; differ from that of, say,<br/>\nCharlotte&#39;s Web, Little House on the Prairie, Sarah Plain and Tall, Lord of<br/>\nthe Flies, King Lear, Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin, Mary Queen of Scots, Tale of Two<br/>\nCities, Tom Sawyer....I could go on and on.<br/>\n<br/>\n    How are *all* those books, which were required reading for me and/or<br/>\nCameron, any more connected to our &quot;real lives&quot; to have any educational<br/>\nvalue?<br/>\n<br/>\n    I don&#39;t know that &quot;educators&quot; really understand how things *ARE*<br/>\nactually connected.
