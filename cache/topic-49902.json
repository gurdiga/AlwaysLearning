I know that guilt was one reason it took me a while to completely unschool my kids.  It just seemed too good to be true.  I was so used to the &quot;no pain, no gain&quot; mentality all of my life that it seemed strange at first to let go of that. So I suggest you also take your time.  I also think that you should give your hubby time to &quot;deschool&quot;.  <br/>\nI must say that for me unschooling doesn&#39;t mean letting my kids go &quot;wild&quot;.  At leat not at the expence of the peace of others in our home.  I think it&#39;s great that you&#39;r relationship with your kids is improving, but if their relationships with their dad and older brother are being harmed then something is not right.<br/>\nI have 4 kids 9yrs-1yr old and our in-laws live with us.  Also my bro-in-law is staying with us temporarily.  I let my kids know that we should treat others the way we would like to be treated and that is with love and respect.<br/>\nFreedom is wonderful, but freedom doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s ok to do whatever we feel like doing at the expence of other people.  That is even true in our society.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nRosy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;kaclip&quot; &lt;katrine@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Iâm learning about unschooling, using what I read here and also using what Iâve been reading in books by Naomi Aldort, (Raising our Kidsâ¦), and Alfie Kohn, (Unconditional Parenting) and feel that Iâm moving in the right direction.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And now I feel guilty.

Isn&#39;t that WHY he works <br/>\nso hard?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you&#39;re making too many changes too quickly. Back off and just say <br/>\nyes more, but don&#39;t unilaterally change the way you (two) are raising <br/>\nyour children. If you want to keep your marriage a good one, or even <br/>\nmake it a better one, then don&#39;t dismiss or disregard your husband&#39;s <br/>\nconcerns.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found that it was a big mistake to try to minimize my husband&#39;s <br/>\nconcerns. When he thought the kids were too...whatever --- lazy, wild, <br/>\nunfocused, not learning what they should be, ....whatever.... it helped <br/>\nhim a lot if I would acknowledge why it seemed that way to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, he says: &quot;Johnny is way too wild. So-and-so big brother <br/>\nwasn&#39;t like that at his age. He shouldn&#39;t be allowed to act like that.&quot; <br/>\nYou can say, &quot;He&#39;s not that wild. He&#39;s just being a normal kid. I&#39;m so <br/>\nhappy to see him have the freedom to be himself.&quot; blah blah blah  Your <br/>\nhusband is NOT going to feel like you were listening - he&#39;s going to <br/>\nfeel like you&#39;re off on a path of your own and not on one with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, just maybe say, &quot;I know - he&#39;s a lot more active than so-and-so <br/>\nwas.&quot; Acknowledge the reality, at least, of what your husband is <br/>\nnoticing. Sometimes, that creates a minor miracle. Your husband might <br/>\nshock you by saying, &quot;Well, each kid is different,&quot; and just moving on. <br/>\nOr, he might want to talk about how to control him and you might be able <br/>\nto have a conversation about helping the kid be wild in ways that don&#39;t <br/>\nimpinge as much on other people&#39;s comfort. A dad who is working as hard <br/>\nas your husband is kind of deserves to come home to a relatively <br/>\npeaceful home. Acknowledge THAT, too, and look for solutions that take <br/>\nthat into account.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust ideas - maybe they&#39;ll inspire you to look a little deeper for your <br/>\nown answers.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":139171607,"authorName":"kaclip","from":"&quot;kaclip&quot; &lt;katrine@...&gt;","profile":"kaclip","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Feelings of guilt","postDate":"1264189971","msgId":49902,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhqY3Ztais5ajBsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":49906,"prevInTime":49901,"nextInTime":49903,"topicId":49902,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I’m learning about unschooling, using what I read here and also using what I’ve been reading in books by Naomi Aldort, (Raising our Kids…), and Alfie","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-66950515\">Iâm learning about unschooling, using what I read here and also using what Iâve been reading in books by Naomi Aldort, (Raising our Kidsâ¦), and Alfie Kohn, (Unconditional Parenting) and feel that Iâm moving in the right direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now I feel guilty.
