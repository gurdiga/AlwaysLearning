Inertia would have come up some <br/>\nother time, some other place. My kids probably know more interesting<br/>\nthings <br/>\nto say about it than I do &lt;G&gt;. I never planned an &quot;inertia&quot; experiment<br/>\nfor <br/>\nthem, to make sure they knew about it.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout 3 days ago I was watching a demonstration of how inertia, mass and<br/>\nforce effect how an ice skater spins.  I wasn&#39;t even think about where<br/>\nthe kids were and how &quot;instructional&quot; this was, I was just watching<br/>\nbecause this kind of thing fascinates me.  I always have something like<br/>\nthis on the TV, Discovery, PBS, History, etc.  I have it on because it&#39;s<br/>\ntruly what I prefer to watch, sometimes the kids join me and sometimes<br/>\nthey don&#39;t.  If they watch it&#39;s because they were drawn to it or my<br/>\nenthusiasm.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis time my daughter was watching from the kitchen table and eventually<br/>\nmoved over next to me.  When it was done she said, &quot;I have no idea what<br/>\nthey were saying.&quot;  I explained it a couple of different ways and with<br/>\nthat &quot;Hmmmmm&quot; look on her face wandered off.  About 20 minutes later she<br/>\ncame back and said, &quot;They could have explained it better if they had just<br/>\nsaid........&quot; and she launched into an explanation which showed she<br/>\nunderstood the concept.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo plans, no experiment, just natural interest.  I didn&#39;t even think it<br/>\nthrough to &quot;She just learned something about physics.&quot; until this thread<br/>\ncame up.  I don&#39;t have a problem with &quot;experiments&quot; if it&#39;s a natural<br/>\nthing, something you would do whether it proved the kids are learning or<br/>\nnot.<br/>\n<br/>\nKris<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
