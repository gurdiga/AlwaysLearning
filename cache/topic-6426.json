I do find Ashley <br/>\ntotally able to handle her brother when other outsiders are not part of the <br/>\npicture. She does want freedom from him and she gets alot. Playdates, <br/>\nsleepovers, weekends at friends houses. When she asks for time with just her <br/>\nfriends she gets it. She is involved in lots of out of the home activities <br/>\nbecause she loves them. She does take up a huge amount of my time and I&#39;m <br/>\nfeeling way overwhelmed by her constant negative to her brother. I have <br/>\nflubbed at times and have tried control parenting, it doesn&#39;t work, so maybe <br/>\nshe is sending some of it back. As for the game, yes, Riley maybe should <br/>\nhave played something different. The 3 of them picked the game. Ashley was <br/>\nactually suppose to be at the 4-H meeting and slipped out when I wasn&#39;t <br/>\nlooking. OK with me, we unschool, right, if you want to be out go ahead. <br/>\nAshley and 17 year old friend each got a turn being it. Logic says he should <br/>\nbe next, but they wouldn&#39;t budge about him being a non speller. The 17 year <br/>\nold is a girl scout conselor and very intune with the kids, it suprised me <br/>\ntoo, but I see favoritism sometimes. My daughter is a magnet for friends, <br/>\nshe makes them all over the place. My son is having a harder time and his <br/>\nbest friends keep moving away. He also wails loudly when hurt, physically <br/>\nand emotionally, so I think people in our court are ignoring him when he <br/>\ncries as a way to cope. He really wants to be listened too, which seems hard <br/>\nfor the friends we have here, mostly 7, 8, and 9 year olds.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you tell your kids you can not be mean and they continue to be mean, <br/>\nwhat do you do? I have told my daughter the things you said Sandra about my <br/>\njob is to protect all the people in the house from meanness, she doesn&#39;t <br/>\nseem to get my seriousness. She keeps being mean. She is also a teaser, <br/>\nwhich really frustrates the little ones. Just this morning Tessa ,who is 2, <br/>\nasked for no kisses. Ashley kissed her 3 more times, so what did Tessa do, <br/>\nshe pinched her, hard, making Ashley cry. Tell me how you would handle this. <br/>\nAshley sets herself up all the time like this. Pushing to find peoples <br/>\nlimits. Her brother will tell her a story and she tells him he is wrong. <br/>\nOuch.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny more thoughts or mom ideas when dealing with respect would be helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary I<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nChat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.msn.com\">http://messenger.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6425,"nextTopicId":6442}}
