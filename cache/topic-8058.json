(oh,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1482109076\">Last Thursday we went to a place called Crystal Park.  It&#39;s over by the<br/>\nBig Hole Battlefield National Monument  near a little, town called Wise<br/>\nRiver.  (oh, oh, Why did Wise River stop crowning a Queen during<br/>\nBattlefield Days???  Nobody wanted to be MISS BIG HOLE!    &lt;snort&gt; ) <br/>\nCrystal Park is National Forest Service land and there&#39;s water,<br/>\npicnicking, potty&#39;s, etc, all the conveniences of home.  <br/>\nAt this amazing place you can turn over a shovel full of sandy dirt and<br/>\nfind crystals and minerals of all kinds.  Quartz and smokey quartz,<br/>\namethyst, sapphire, it&#39;s wonderful.<br/>\nWe took my friend Linda and her visiting nephew, Lane, who is a very<br/>\nsmart and studious and quiet boy, but if fun that day could be measured<br/>\nby layers of dirt, he had more than any of us.  <br/>\nDylan took his rock pick, but the digging was so easy he didn&#39;t need it<br/>\nmuch, and the boys found bags full of crystals.  <br/>\nThe terrain is surreal.  People have been digging there for years and<br/>\nit&#39;s not an open, barren pit but some steep and some flat land, and<br/>\nforested.   As you walk around there are pits and holes and mounds of<br/>\ndirt.  If you threw in a naked woman or a melting wristwatch it could be<br/>\na Dali painting. (or a crime scene!)  Truly weird. There are chipmunks<br/>\nevery where and by golly you&#39;d better have something for them because<br/>\nthey just charge right up to you and demand food, like little, fat<br/>\nhighway men.  <br/>\nThe kids climbed around in pits and on boulders and Dylan identified<br/>\nrocks and they dug and dug and played and picked wild flowers for us.  It<br/>\nthundered and threatened to storm the whole time we were there but it<br/>\ndidn&#39;t rain.  We spent hours digging, sifting dirt, washing crystals and<br/>\nplaying.  <br/>\nThen last Friday and Saturday was Art in the Park, in Anaconda, where<br/>\ntalented folks get together to sell their wares.  There&#39;s food and music<br/>\nand dancing, but most importantly, pottery.&lt;g&gt;   The boys liked the food<br/>\nand dancing part the most. Who&#39;d have thought a nine and ten year old<br/>\ncould eat and dance so much?   I laughed so hard my stomach hurt for<br/>\ndays.<br/>\nThis week has been quiet and slow.  Lane went home to eastern Montana,<br/>\nwe&#39;re dog sitting for our neighbors and Dylan is studying like mad for<br/>\nhis purple belt test.  I had to move the kicking bag outside it rattled<br/>\nthe house so much.  <br/>\nWe&#39;re watching a baby Yellow Warbler in our apple tree as he tries to<br/>\nfly.  We&#39;ve been worrying over him through hail storms and high winds and<br/>\nGunther, the cat from down the street,  but there he sits this morning,<br/>\nready to try again. <br/>\nWe finally identified our mystery stink bug, Perillus bioculatus, for<br/>\nthose who care. &lt;g&gt;   But still researching a new jumping spider.  And we<br/>\nhave big plans for the Drive-in Saturday night.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8038,"nextTopicId":8060}}
