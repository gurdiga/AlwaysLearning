I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2049127003\"> Its amazing how learning is all connected.<br/>\nSome may think that playing video games is a waste of time and that a child <br/>\nneeds a well rounded education.<br/>\nI have a homeschooling friend that is really into all the well rounded classic <br/>\neducation.<br/>\nHer kids have classes for; French, piano and ballet just to mention a few.<br/>\nIt was not like her oldest boy wanted to learn ballet or tap dancing. <br/>\nHe really wanted to do TaeKwon Do.<br/>\nBut he is stuck with Tap dancing and ballet. Hard for a kid build like a <br/>\nlinebacker that loves fighting  and stuff that is very boyish.<br/>\nIt is not that her kids all asked for piano lessons.<br/>\nThat is what they do.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son MD turned 8 this Summer and   has never really asked to learn any <br/>\ninstrument.<br/>\nWe have a piano he played a lot as a toddler. We had an acoustic guitar ( I fell <br/>\non it and broke it :(  )<br/>\n MD really loves playing video games. He loves Legends of Zelda and has many of <br/>\nthe games.<br/>\nHe has also read about 10 of the Manga books.<br/>\nHe is very interested in Knights and all that goes with Middle Ages until about <br/>\nthe Renaissance period.<br/>\nSO Friday we went to the Minnesota Renaissance Festival.<br/>\nIt was school days so they had several events specially for kids .<br/>\nWe made plans to get there early before 10 AM so he could hear about swords and <br/>\nfighting.<br/>\nHe listened to them show and demonstrate  combat for over an hour and was <br/>\ntotally into it.<br/>\nOn the way there, a two hour drive, he read his book about Knights.<br/>\nThen we watched the jousting  and many other cool things around.<br/>\nAbout one hour before we left I was in a store as Gigi , my 4 year old daughter, <br/>\nwas checking<br/>\nout dresses and other girl stuff, I looked across the street and there is a <br/>\nstore with Ocarinas for sale.<br/>\nNext I see a sign with a triangle that I recognize as the Tri- Force symbol for <br/>\nLegends of Zelda.<br/>\nI have not played any of the games but I listen and watch and I have read a few <br/>\npages of the books.<br/>\nMainly I have listened to my son talk about it.<br/>\nThere is one game that Link plays the Ocarina.<br/>\n SO we all went across the street and I bought him an Ocarina. They came with <br/>\n two sheets of songs including one with <br/>\n<br/>\nthe music from the video games.<br/>\nHe practiced playing for almost two hours coming home and have practiced since <br/>\nFriday.<br/>\nI started writing this post just after he started to practice again. He <br/>\njust got done and it has been almost one hour.<br/>\n( I write a little, feed a kid, move laundry...)<br/>\nSo from liking Knights, swords, video games my son has found a musical <br/>\ninstrument that he wants to learn.<br/>\nOcarinas are hard but he is very happy with how he is playing.<br/>\nThis may not last long or it may. I don&#39;t know yet. But it is sure amazing to <br/>\nsee him learn so much and be happy with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57483,"nextTopicId":57554}}
