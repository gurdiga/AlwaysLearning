This week we <br/>\ngot our CAT tests to do, to fulfill Virginia requirtements and the <br/>\nchildren don&#39;t want to do them. My husband seems to think that <br/>\nthey should get 90%+ in order to prove that &#39;unschooling&#39; works <br/>\n(he&#39;s amathematician, you&#39;d think he would know that average is <br/>\n50% but he&#39;s always scored top marks in every test or exam he <br/>\nlooked at and he was top of his year for the whole country in his <br/>\nmaths degree). I tried pointing out to him that if they were in <br/>\nschool, years of boredom would have resulted in not only low <br/>\nmarks but disaffectation with learning itself but because he <br/>\nenjoyed school he doesn&#39;t believe me. accused me of making <br/>\nup psychobabble. He cited all the homeschoolers we know <br/>\nwho&#39;s kids can&#39;t read by 8 or so, said I was ruining my children&#39;s <br/>\nlife through sticking to a philosophy that was &#39;unproven&#39; (he&#39;s a <br/>\nscientist, can you tell?) <br/>\nThen he cited all the other homeschoolers who score in national  <br/>\ntests, who are building rockets by the time they are 6, who spend  <br/>\nages reading books, who are maths geniuses (are these the <br/>\nsame ones who can&#39;t read?), who spend all day excited by <br/>\nmicroscopes etc etc.<br/>\nWhen my daughter was in school (from age 4 to 8) she was at <br/>\nleast 6 years head of her peers in maths. Now that she is 10 and  <br/>\nhas been homeschooled for 2 years, she is not. She&#39;s maybe 2 <br/>\nyears ahead in some areas and average in others. He ranted on  <br/>\nabout that too.<br/>\nI feel fed up with the lack of support. I feel guilty that everyone <br/>\nelse is buying curricula and spending all day conducting science  <br/>\nexperiements. I am tired from fighting with my children all day  <br/>\nabout everything.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry you&#39;re having a hard time Shyrley.  It sounds like you&#39;re <br/>\nunder a lot of stress right now.  I&#39;m sorry that you&#39;re husband is <br/>\nbeing so unsupportive of you.  I don&#39;t mean to offend you, but it <br/>\nsounds to me as if he doesn&#39;t have faith in you, to do what is <br/>\nright for your kids.  Doesn&#39;t he believe that you&#39;ve researched <br/>\nunschooling and have faith in what you&#39;re doing?  What does he <br/>\nconsider to be important for his children to be successful, and <br/>\nwhy does he measure their success against his (as in they have <br/>\nto get top marks)?  Is a love of life and learning successful? Or is <br/>\nit just how much money they earn, or how much notoriety they <br/>\nhave in their field?  What if one of them chooses to be a <br/>\nhousecleaner or a handyperson?  Is that going to be totally <br/>\nunacceptable to him and, if so, why?  Has he done any reading <br/>\nor research on unschooling himself?  If he hasn&#39;t, then I would <br/>\npoint him in the direction of books and websites and tell him to <br/>\nstart reading before he criticizes any more.  If he is undermining <br/>\nyou and doesn&#39;t seem to trust you then your kids are probably <br/>\npicking up on it and feeling unsettled and insecure, which in turn <br/>\nleads to more strife between you and your kids.<br/>\nThere are millions of people in this world who hated or had a <br/>\nhard time in school.  That&#39;s not &quot;psychobabble&quot;.  I&#39;m sure there <br/>\nare books and websites where this could be researched and <br/>\ndocumented as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; This morning they are refusing to eat because the bread is <br/>\namerican.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may be because you&#39;ve all seemed to have a hard time <br/>\nassimilating into the area you&#39;re in, and so have negative <br/>\nimages of the USA.  Also you&#39;ve all been homesick.  When you <br/>\ndo some travelling (and/or when you move), you may find that <br/>\nyour impressions and/or feelings about the USA change.

This site gave even a better explanation, though, since<br/>\nthe snopes article referred to a daddy longlegs as an arachnid that wasn&#39;t a<br/>\ntrue spider, and this explains it:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://spiders.ucr.edu/daddylonglegs.html\">http://spiders.ucr.edu/daddylonglegs.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDADDY-LONGLEGS ARE ONE OF THE MOST POISONOUS SPIDERS BUT THEIR FANGS ARE TOO<br/>\nSHORT TO BITE HUMANS<br/>\nThis tale has been lurking around for years. I have heard it repeatedly in<br/>\nthe United States and even heard a schoolteacher misinforming her class at a<br/>\nmuseum in Brisbane, Australia. This is incorrect, but to clarify it, several<br/>\npoints need to be explained first.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe animals<br/>\nMost folks who retell this tale have no idea that they are referring to two<br/>\ncompletely separate groups of animals: &quot;daddy-longlegs&quot; and &quot;daddy-longlegs<br/>\nspiders&quot;. In the animal class Arachnida, there are several lower level<br/>\ndivisions called Orders. Scorpions are in the Order Scorpiones, spiders are<br/>\nin the Order Araneae, ticks and mites are in the Order Acari.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe creatures most correctly called daddy-longlegs are in their own separate<br/>\nOrder which is Opiliones. Common names for this Order are 1) daddy-longlegs,<br/>\n2) harvestmen and 3) opilionids. They are characterized by having one basic<br/>\nbody segment which shows segmentation on the posterior portion, at most 2<br/>\neyes and all 8 legs attach to the pill-like body segment. They are usually<br/>\nfound under logs and rocks, prefer moist habitat although they can be found<br/>\nin the desert, often have long flexible legs (in the temperate Northern<br/>\nhemisphere but there are also short-legged daddy-longlegs) and they do not<br/>\nproduce silk so therefore they are never found in webs unless they are being<br/>\neaten by spiders. Because they are found under logs and other stuff which<br/>\npeople most often are not turning over, most folks don&#39;t run into<br/>\ndaddy-longlegs very often.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother creature often called daddy-longlegs are actually spiders. These<br/>\nlong-legged spiders are in the family Pholcidae. Previously the common name<br/>\nof this family was the cellar spiders but arachnologists have also given<br/>\nthem the moniker of &quot;daddy-longlegs spiders&quot; because of the confusion<br/>\ngenerated by the general public. Because these arachnids are spiders, they<br/>\nhave 2 body basic body parts (cephalothorax and abdomen), have 8 eyes most<br/>\noften clumped together in the front of the body, the abdomen shows no<br/>\nevidence of segmentation, have 8 legs all attached to the front most body<br/>\npart (the cephalothorax) and make webs out of silk. This is most probably<br/>\nthe animal to which people refer when they tell the tale because these<br/>\nspiders are plentiful especially in cellars (hence their common name) and<br/>\nare commonly seen by the general public. The most common pholcid spiders<br/>\nfound in U.S. homes are both European immigrants. Pholcus phalangioides is a<br/>\nuniformly grey spider with rectangular, elongate abdomen and is found<br/>\nthroughout the U.S. Holocnemus pluchei also has a rectangular, elongate<br/>\nabdomen but has a brown stripe on the ventral side (the belly side - which<br/>\nis typically directed upwards since the spider hangs upside down in its web)<br/>\nwhich covers its sternum and is a stripe on the abdomen. These spiders are<br/>\nvery common along the Pacific Coast. and into the southwest deserts.<br/>\n<br/>\nPossible envenomation<br/>\nIs there any truth to this oft-repeated tale?<br/>\n<br/>\nDaddy-longlegs (Opiliones) - these arachnids make their living by eating<br/>\ndecomposing vegetative and animal matter although are opportunist predators<br/>\nif they can get away with it. They do not have venom glands, fangs or any<br/>\nother mechanism for chemically subduing their food. Therefore, they do not<br/>\nhave poison and, by the powers of logic, cannot be poisonous from venom.<br/>\nSome have defensive secretions that might be poisonous to small animals if<br/>\ningested. So, for these daddy-long-legs, the tale is clearly false.<br/>\n<br/>\nDaddy-longlegs spiders (Pholcidae) - Here, the myth is incorrect at least in<br/>\nmaking claims that have no basis in known facts. There is no reference to<br/>\nany pholcid spider biting a human and causing any detrimental reaction. If<br/>\nthese spiders were indeed deadly poisonous but couldn&#39;t bite humans, then<br/>\nthe only way we would know that they are poisonous is by milking them and<br/>\ninjecting the venom into humans. For a variety of reasons including Amnesty<br/>\nInternational and a humanitarian code of ethics, this research has never<br/>\nbeen done. Furthermore, there are no toxicological studies testing the<br/>\nlethality of pholcid venom on any mammalian system (this is usually done<br/>\nwith mice). Therefore, no information is available on the likely toxic<br/>\neffects of their venom in humans, so the part of the myth about their being<br/>\nespecially poisonous is just that: a myth. There is no scientific basis for<br/>\nthe supposition that they are deadly poisonous and there is no reason to<br/>\nassume that it is true.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about their fangs being too short to penetrate human skin? Pholcids do<br/>\nindeed have short fangs, which in arachnological terms is called &quot;uncate&quot;<br/>\nbecause they have a secondary tooth which meets the fang like the way the<br/>\ntwo grabbing parts of a pair of tongs come together. Brown recluse spiders<br/>\nsimilarly have uncate fang structure and they obviously are able to bite<br/>\nhumans. There may be a difference in the musculature that houses the fang<br/>\nsuch that recluses have stronger muscles for penetration because they are<br/>\nhunting spiders needing to subdue prey whereas pholcid spiders are able to<br/>\nwrap their prey and don&#39;t need as strong a musculature. So, again, the myth<br/>\nstates as fact something about which there is no scientific basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn summary<br/>\nFor true daddy-long-legs, the opilionids, the myth is certainly false, and<br/>\nfor the daddy-long-legs spiders it is certainly not based on known facts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2294225,"authorName":"freeform@juno.com","from":"freeform@...","profile":"freeform_ca","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Spiders!","postDate":"1021571411","msgId":7048,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwNTE2LjEwNTAxNC4tMzI1MTg3LjEuZnJlZWZvcm1AanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":7050,"prevInTime":7047,"nextInTime":7049,"topicId":7048,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On Thu, 16 May 2002 08:57:06 -0700 Nancy Wooton  ... of ... danger ... poisonous ...

First of all, the daddy longlegs<br/>\nisn&#39;t &quot;poisonous&quot; at all. Poisonous animals give off toxins which are<br/>\nabsorbed when they are touched or eaten by attackers; spiders are an<br/>\nexample of venomous creatures, which transmit toxins by injecting them<br/>\ninto their victims. And the honor of the world&#39;s most poisonous animal is<br/>\ngenerally awarded to the South American poison dart frog or the box<br/>\njellyfish. <br/>\nThe daddy longlegs isn&#39;t technically a spider, but even if it were, it<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be the world&#39;s most venomous one of those, either -- that prize<br/>\nis claimed by the funnel web spider or the brown recluse spider. The<br/>\ndaddy longlegs isn&#39;t &quot;poisonous&quot; (or venomous) at all. In fact, it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t even bite and poses absolutely no threat to human beings (other<br/>\nthan sometimes emitting a foul smell). <br/>\nSome of the confusion undoubtedly stems from a North American<br/>\nperspective, since more than one critter in the world is referred to as<br/>\n&quot;daddy longlegs.&quot; The crane fly, an unrelated winged insect which looks<br/>\nlike a large mosquito, is also called daddy longlegs in some parts of the<br/>\nworld (such as England), but it too is a non-venomous, non-biting<br/>\ncreature. Pholcus phalangioides, also known as the long-legged cellar<br/>\nspider, is another example of a &quot;daddy longlegs,&quot; probably the one<br/>\nreferred to here as being the world&#39;s &quot;most poisonous animal&quot;: <br/>\nAlthough Pholcus phalangioides is indeed a spider and is venomous to<br/>\nboot, it is (as suggested) far too small to pose any threat to human<br/>\nbeings, so the strength of its venom is moot. <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7174,"nextTopicId":7201}}
