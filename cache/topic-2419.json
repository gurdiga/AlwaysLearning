I explained in my initial question that I run a home daycare.  So, yes we get outside - we actually spend lots of time out there.  We are limited to a small section of the yard that is fenced in, but we make good use of the space.  We follow bugs and build things in the sand box.  She swings on the swings and plays.  After daycare hours I take her outside to garden with me.  Usually she spends that time rolling down the hill near the garden....lol.  I didn&#39;t mean to make it sound like we couldn&#39;t leave the house.  We just feel a bit like caged rats sometimes - lol.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou are right that I&#39;ve got to adjust my thinking.  My issue with not being able to take spontaneous trips is I guess because I&#39;ve just gotten the idea in my head that following the child in her learning interests would require that we are able to get out in the world and get the information that she seeks when she seeks it.  Not &quot;Well, this Saturday if you are still interested we can take a trip to &lt;insert location&gt; to learn more about that&quot; She&#39;s 6...she doesn&#39;t stay interested in very much long enough to wait.  So, we are missing opportunities.  Using the computer is an option, but she doesn&#39;t have the patients for searching things on the internet.  It&#39;s much more efficient to go to the library a find a book about what we want to know or run to a museum that has an exhibit about it.  So we do use the internet if I&#39;m fairly certain of where to find the info...otherwise she walks away saying &quot;Nevermind&quot;  LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway...obviously I&#39;ve got lots more thinking to do about this.

I am homeschooling my youngest child, and have homeschooled my oldest one although she is back in public school now (her choice).  We live in a small town, my husband works a lot of hours and generally doesn&#39;t do any of the schooling with the kids unless there is a specific piece of a project that he wants to/is asked to do.  I am a home daycare provider and so we are basically home bound most of the week.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve not been unschooling but have always been interested in it.  I always intended to look into it and see how it would work for us but just never got the chance.  And then today, Alora out of the blue started talking about wanting to be in a wheel chair.  It sparked a discussion about how life would change for her which turned into a discussion about accessibility.  She went all around the house and pointed out all the things that would be difficult for her if she was in a wheelchair and is very interested in talking about it!  So, then I realized that it would be awesome for her developing empathy to get her a wheelchair and let her spend a day or two trying to figure out how to get around during our daily activities.  So I posted to our freecycle sites looking for a child sized wheel chair that we could borrow/have.  Then all of the sudden I realized - &quot;This must be what homeschooling is like!&quot; We could spend days measuring areas of the house and designing accessible equiptment.  I haven&#39;t seen her this excited about learning but she doesn&#39;t even seem to know that she&#39;s learning...so AWESOME!!  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the question - My big concern is that we&#39;ll commit to unschooling and then she&#39;ll decide to go back to public school next year and won&#39;t have learned yet the stuff that she&#39;ll need in order to transition back in.  I&#39;m also concerned that I can&#39;t with my schedule unschool successfully.  I can&#39;t just up and go to the museum or a library to learn more about something she&#39;s interested in.  We can&#39;t go for nature walks every day.  We are stuck in this house for a good portion of most days, and I&#39;ve always thought that unschoolers are able to do what they do because they have more opportunities to get out in the world.  Is there anyone else who had these concerns/limitations when they started unschooling?  If so....how did you get past them?  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nLeah</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":195979760,"authorName":"MLewis","from":"&quot;MLewis&quot; &lt;m9f9l@...&gt;","profile":"m9f9l","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Question","postDate":"1214297574","msgId":35714,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGczcWNsNisxcmphQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGczcGxobCtlaWZuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":35712,"nextInTopic":54554,"prevInTime":35713,"nextInTime":35715,"topicId":2419,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I usually just say how old my child is, since that s usually the underlying question.

So many parents are holding kids back or starting them early.

My own kids are more likely to freak out if I even start the car before they&#39;re buckled in, but they&#39;ve all resisted the carseat after age 3 or so.  The most recent version of this is that Dan wants his carseat moved to the middle of the backseat (right now they each sit at a window).  Sure, I could buckle his seat in there, but it would really crowd his brother.  What do you say when the only reason you can&#39;t comply is fairness to others?  He&#39;s never acknowledged it would be unfair to his brother -- I&#39;ve just told him I won&#39;t do it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I find my biggest challenge with consensual living is reaching a compromise when one of us wants/needs to go somewhere and others resist going along.  My kids are too young to stay home alone, and we simply don&#39;t have the income to pay a sitter (besides where would I find someone mid-day on a weekday during the schoolyear?).  It seems the more I try to convince for the activity or commitment, the more resistance I get.  Fortunately, it&#39;s not terribly often, but invariably it&#39;s when I simply don&#39;t have the time to negotiate.<br/>\n<br/>\n  A recent example is that Andy has decided we doesn&#39;t want to go along to LaLeche meetings.  I&#39;m one of two leaders in our group, so skipping the meeting really isn&#39;t an option.  I&#39;m on call for the phones one day a week, and also listed online, so I sometimes get calls when it&#39;s not my day.  When I interrupt or have to put off something he wants to take a call, he&#39;s very upset.  This week, he&#39;s said several times that he&#39;d like me to quit LaLeche League.  That&#39;s not an option -- I really enjoy this and it&#39;s important to me.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  And what do you do/say within TCS for those instances where two children are at complete odds over something and there&#39;s just no physical way to accommodate both?  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Syl<br/>\n<br/>\n              <br/>\n  ---------------------------------<br/>\n  Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n  Yahoo!

If a kid does bring in report cards <br/>\nwith the A&#39;s and they get the patch they are congratulated, but it&#39;s pretty <br/>\nlow key. Glenn&#39;s instructor is a great instance of a non-academically <br/>\ntalented karate student. He is 19 years old, the dojo owner&#39;s son, very <br/>\nhandsome, and the kindest, most loving, sweetest person I have ever known. He <br/>\nis amazingly talented in karate and in kickboxing (holds numerous national <br/>\ntitles and several world titles) and not in the least at school. All his <br/>\nyears in school he never got straight A&#39;s or anything close to it and it <br/>\ndidn&#39;t matter. His dad didn&#39;t fuss at him, nobody cared that he didn&#39;t have <br/>\neven one academic patch on his gi. So it&#39;s not like there is a stigma <br/>\nattached to not having the patch. My son Glenn just wants to earn one. I&#39;m <br/>\ntrying to figure out how to help him meet that goal in some sort of manner we <br/>\ncan both be happy with. I&#39;d prefer it if he didn&#39;t care about the patch, but <br/>\nfor right now he does, so that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to work with.

They wouldn&#39;t allow summaries for<br/>\nhigh school, though, and some parents thought the whole thing was too<br/>\nmuch off a hassle anyway, so we just did all A&#39;s or O&#39;s (for Outstanding,<br/>\nthe K-3 deal was O -S - N).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole thing was one of the more annoying changes, and one of the<br/>\nreasons I left.
