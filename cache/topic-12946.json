I should say almost 6 as his birthday is next weekend <br/>\nbut he has decided to change his birthday so he won&#39;t be 6 now until June.  <br/>\nAnd don&#39;t try to tell him otherwise.  LOL.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe started out as attachment parents (is that a phrase) but didn&#39;t know it <br/>\nwas called attachment parenting.  Then when it came time to think about <br/>\n&quot;school&quot; and &quot;preschool&quot; I had set in my mind that learning for them would <br/>\nalways be fun.  Not like it was for me.  And after thinking about things and <br/>\ndabbling a little.  Like introducing a subject and seeing my oldest turn up <br/>\nhis nose we decided that we would follow their passions. Let them decide what <br/>\nthey were interested in and we would help them out by answering questions <br/>\nproviding transportation and making suggestions always knowing that they <br/>\nwould be the ones to make the choices.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt just fit in with our lifestyle.  Then about 2 years ago we discovered that <br/>\nit had a name.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t have a typical day.  Errands, play groups, right now they are into <br/>\naliens, Warhammer 40,000, Mythology, LEGOs, play doh, oh and we just made <br/>\nsome neat stepping stones for the flower garden.  We are going to a play this <br/>\nweek.  Anyway hope that helps on your journey.<br/>\nPam G.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12945,"nextTopicId":12949}}
