They&#39;re<br/>\nfascinating, big crabs with claws so strong they can crack coconuts.  <br/>\nTwo of the coconut crab habitats mentioned were Gardner Island and <br/>\nHowland Island.

Some hopeful Amelia Earhart fans have suggested she<br/>\nsomehow made it to one of the islands and survived for some time,<br/>\nsomehow.  We speculated that if she&#39;d had reached the sandy shores of the<br/>\nisland, exhausted, and had fallen into a coma like state... (remember,<br/>\nshe&#39;d been ill in the days leading up to her disappearance and probably<br/>\ninjured when the Electra crashed) Coconut crabs, mistaking her head for<br/>\n(what else?) a coconut may have snipped her open. (CRUNCH)  Then, upon<br/>\ndiscovering yucky brains inside instead of lovely coconut milk, realized<br/>\ntheir mistake and buried her on the beach.
