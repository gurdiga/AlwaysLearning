In different I mean she has always been somewhat of an<br/>\n&gt; introvert- very clingy as a baby, nursed for 2 solid years and refused<br/>\n&gt; solid foods until she weaned, spoke very little until baby # 3 came<br/>\n&gt; along (she was 2 1/2) and as of the present reads very little and<br/>\n&gt; struggles to articulate herself. She is finally becoming much more<br/>\n&gt; verbal with others- so much so it struck me the other day when at a<br/>\n&gt; restaurant she very bluntly blurted out what her selection for her  <br/>\n&gt; meal<br/>\n&gt; was going to be ( I usually order for her).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What does nursing for two years have to do with anything? Two years  <br/>\nisn&#39;t long. It also isn&#39;t at all uncommon for younger kids not to  <br/>\nspeak as early or as much as older siblings. My now-19 year old  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t order for herself in restaurants until she was a young teen.  <br/>\nVery shy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She really is truly a<br/>\n&gt; beautiful child and very similar, it seems, to my husband. He  <br/>\n&gt; claims he<br/>\n&gt; was very much the same as her as a child. She is quite artistic and  <br/>\n&gt; very<br/>\n&gt; passionate about whatever she is working on. She frustrates easily<br/>\n&gt; though when her siblings don&#39;t follow her rules for play and as of<br/>\n&gt; recently she is very quick to correct and set straight what she  <br/>\n&gt; sees as<br/>\n&gt; wrong or bothersome behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>She&#39;ll probably always have a strong sense of justice and she&#39;ll be  <br/>\nfrustrated that not everybody shares it. Over time you will help her  <br/>\nto learn to decide when it is &quot;worth it&quot; to set others straight and  <br/>\nwhen to be silent. She&#39;ll learn this through trial and error, so  <br/>\nyou&#39;ll also be there to comfort her when she finds out the hard way  <br/>\nthat others don&#39;t often appreciate unsolicited opinions about their  <br/>\nbehavior.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She seems at times lonely yet I really<br/>\n&gt; think she is just intensely thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My very-intense middle daughter IS lonely sometimes, yet other times  <br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t want company because she&#39;s deeply involved in her own  <br/>\nstuff. She wants friends who are there when she wants them, but isn&#39;t  <br/>\nsuper good at maintaining friendships because she needs/wants so much  <br/>\nalone time, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My problem is that I tire easily<br/>\n&gt; trying to listen as she attempts to tell me things<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Tire easily? You don&#39;t get to do that - you&#39;re her mom. If you&#39;re  <br/>\ntiring &quot;easily&quot; then maybe you need to find a way to have more energy  <br/>\nfor her.  How tiring can it be to talk with your own child? What do  <br/>\nyou mean &quot;attempts to tell&quot; you things? Meaning she&#39;s not articulate  <br/>\nenough for you to understand what she&#39;s trying to tell you? Then all  <br/>\nthe conversations you have together are part of what you could  <br/>\nconsider &quot;speech therapy&quot; and it is, if anything, even MORE important  <br/>\nthat you listen patiently, reflect back to her what you do  <br/>\nunderstand, help her phrase things when you can, etc. If you&#39;re  <br/>\nletting on that you&#39;re impatient, then you could be creating a  <br/>\nproblem of her feeling pressured and that&#39;s likely to make her less  <br/>\narticulate, not help her express herself more easily.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and I find it<br/>\n&gt; difficult at times to be sensitive when she overreacts to situations<br/>\n&gt; that irritate her.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I truly understand. HOW many times I&#39;ve thought (and occasionally and  <br/>\nregrettably said aloud to her) that my daughter is overreacting. I  <br/>\nremember we were sitting around a campfire with lots of other people  <br/>\nand playing a game and my daughter quietly &quot;called out&quot; an answer and  <br/>\nsomeone else heard and they called it out louder. They were heard and  <br/>\ngot the &quot;credit&quot; for her answer. She was really upset about how it  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t fair. She was about 9 years old, by the way. I was embarrassed  <br/>\nand made things far worse by trying to shush her. She got more and  <br/>\nmore upset and I had to take her away from the group and she sobbed  <br/>\nand sobbed. I was frustrated and told her she was acting like it was  <br/>\nthe end of the world. She sobbed more and got angry with me, too.  <br/>\nThings escalated until I took her back to our tent and the evening  <br/>\nwas over for us. I was mad that she&#39;d wrecked MY night and she was  <br/>\nhumiliated and angry. This kind of scenario repeated a number of  <br/>\ntimes over the years. Looking back, I know NOW that what I should  <br/>\nhave done was take her very seriously - she was totally right and the  <br/>\nperson should NOT have taken credit for her answer. It was cheating  <br/>\nand unfair and it mattered tremendously to her 9 year old self. She  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t care about the rest of the world, ending or not &lt;G&gt;. I should  <br/>\nhave commiserated and comforted and maybe even spoken up and said,  <br/>\n&quot;Just for the record, that last answer was first given by Roxana.&quot;  <br/>\nSHE would have seen that as me standing up for what was right. Who  <br/>\ncares if other adults would have thought it was making a mountain out  <br/>\nof a molehill? Knowing what I know now, I realize made many mistakes  <br/>\nof this type - trivializing what was really super important to her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She seems rather immature on some level yet very self<br/>\n&gt; assured on others.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>She is who she is - so what she needs is you to accept that. Learn  <br/>\nfrom my experience and don&#39;t expect her to &quot;act&quot; mature all the time  <br/>\nor to have mature considerations or understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I guess I just need some help understanding her. We<br/>\n&gt; are so different and I&#39;m not sure what she needs of me.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Probably for you to listen to her more willingly and eagerly and  <br/>\npatiently (without showing that you&#39;re being patient). I know my  <br/>\nmiddle daughter needed me to &quot;be there&quot; for her when she was ready to  <br/>\ntalk, even more than my other kids did. And it was easy for me to  <br/>\nunintentionally blow her off because if I didn&#39;t appear to be eager/ <br/>\nwilling, she&#39;d just drop it and I&#39;d miss an opportunity to connect  <br/>\nwith her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I wonder if she<br/>\n&gt; feels different than her siblings or other kids her age and if that is<br/>\n&gt; causing her confusion & insecurity.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Of course she feels different.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She realizes reading is a useful<br/>\n&gt; skill she would like to have, but does not work very hard to build her<br/>\n&gt; ability up.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Does she think that she needs to do that in order to learn to read?  <br/>\nIf I was you, I&#39;d be sure to toss around ideas about multiple  <br/>\nintelligences - in words she can understand. What she needs is to be  <br/>\naware that children develop different skills at different ages as  <br/>\ntheir brains and nervous systems develop differently. She has  <br/>\ndeveloped some ability to think deeply about justice and morality and  <br/>\nethics. Lots of kids haven&#39;t got that ability at her age. And her  <br/>\nartistic abilities are developing before her language abilities and  <br/>\nthat&#39;s great - every person is unique and this is how she is. When it  <br/>\nis natural to do so, point out how so-and-so has natural physical  <br/>\nability and so-and-so has natural singing ability and how someone  <br/>\nelse has natural reading ability - all learning things, all  <br/>\ndeveloping at their own speeds in their own directions. What an  <br/>\nadventure it IS to grow and find out what her own special strengths  <br/>\nwill be. Don&#39;t let her think learning to read requires that SHE work  <br/>\nat it - it really just requires that her brain be developed in  <br/>\ncertain areas. Commiserate if she says it is hard to wait, but also  <br/>\npoint out that she can listen to books as much as she wants, no need  <br/>\nto wait to be able to read them for herself, right? If she wants to  <br/>\nbe more well-read, get her audible books on an mp3 player to listen  <br/>\nto on her own.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I suppose it&#39;s just not important to her enough yet,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yikes. Have you told her that she&#39;ll be able to learn when it is  <br/>\nimportant enough to her? So now she feels like it is her own laziness  <br/>\nthat is keeping her from reading? You owe her an apology, in that  <br/>\ncase, because that is SO not true.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but as<br/>\n&gt; her 6 yr old sister is advancing and her 5 yr old brother showing much<br/>\n&gt; interest I&#39;m worried this will cause more frustration for her.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It could - but get her lots of books to listen to so that she can  <br/>\nhave the chance to have &quot;read&quot; books before they did and she can  <br/>\nrecommend books to them, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Does<br/>\n&gt; anyone have any suggestions for me in how I should relate to her or  <br/>\n&gt; help<br/>\n&gt; her in anyway?

She is the 2nd of 4 children and quite different in many ways than<br/>\n&gt; my other 3. In different I mean she has always been somewhat of an<br/>\n&gt; introvert- very clingy as a baby, nursed for 2 solid years and refused<br/>\n&gt; solid foods until she weaned, spoke very little until baby # 3 came<br/>\n&gt; along (she was 2 1/2) and as of the present reads very little and<br/>\n&gt; struggles to articulate herself. She is finally becoming much more<br/>\n&gt; verbal with others- so much so it struck me the other day when at a<br/>\n&gt; restaurant she very bluntly blurted out what her selection for her meal<br/>\n&gt; was going to be ( I usually order for her). She really is truly a<br/>\n&gt; beautiful child and very similar, it seems, to my husband. He claims he<br/>\n&gt; was very much the same as her as a child. She is quite artistic and <br/>\n&gt; very<br/>\n&gt; passionate about whatever she is working on. She frustrates easily<br/>\n&gt; though when her siblings don&#39;t follow her rules for play and as of<br/>\n&gt; recently she is very quick to correct and set straight what she sees as<br/>\n&gt; wrong or bothersome behavior. She seems at times lonely yet I really<br/>\n&gt; think she is just intensely thinking. My problem is that I tire easily<br/>\n&gt; trying to listen as she attempts to tell me things and I find it<br/>\n&gt; difficult at times to be sensitive when she overreacts to situations<br/>\n&gt; that irritate her. She seems rather immature on some level yet very <br/>\n&gt; self<br/>\n&gt; assured on others. I guess I just need some help understanding her. We<br/>\n&gt; are so different and I&#39;m not sure what she needs of me. I wonder if she<br/>\n&gt; feels different than her siblings or other kids her age and if that is<br/>\n&gt; causing her confusion & insecurity. She realizes reading is a useful<br/>\n&gt; skill she would like to have, but does not work very hard to build her<br/>\n&gt; ability up. I suppose it&#39;s just not important to her enough yet, but as<br/>\n&gt; her 6 yr old sister is advancing and her 5 yr old brother showing much<br/>\n&gt; interest I&#39;m worried this will cause more frustration for her. Does<br/>\n&gt; anyone have any suggestions for me in how I should relate to her or <br/>\n&gt; help<br/>\n&gt; her in anyway?

If it&#39;s the school which <br/>\noften identifies these problems, and we never send our kids, how do we <br/>\nknow if they&#39;re just following their own timetable, or if they need <br/>\nsome kind of intervention?

He was intensely quiet for long periods, and it took me quite a<br/>\nwhile to feel comfortable with that. I thought it indicated that he was in<br/>\ndiscomfort. But really, he was just fine with his reflection and<br/>\nthinking...he wasn&#39;t looking for outside help or connection during these<br/>\ntimes. I learned to not &quot;leave him alone&quot;, but to let him be while at the<br/>\nsame time being watchful for a time that I could supportively say, &quot;hi&quot;.<br/>\nThat often opened up discussion for us...it wasn&#39;t invasive or intruding in<br/>\nhis space, but a simple word that was more an invitation if he wanted to<br/>\nconnect. It was important to not try to get him out of his space, but to<br/>\nfigure out ways to join in his space...respectfully.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd his long periods of introversion were often followed by explosions of<br/>\nactivity...it&#39;s just the way his brain worked.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe talked at a later age too...lots of kids do. He still has great<br/>\ndifficulty expressing his thoughts and feelings, but he writes. He writes<br/>\nmovie scripts, short stories, poems, etc...writing is a very important part<br/>\nof his life. When he was younger, he drew a whole bunch, mostly stick<br/>\nfigures, because his hands didn&#39;t work all that well with writing or<br/>\ndrawing, and to this day it is very difficult to read his writing. He types<br/>\nreally well. He can type about 50 words a minute and he this has been a<br/>\ngreat communication tool for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has always been important for me to be especially vigilant to listen to<br/>\nhis words, to try to interpret what he is really trying to say. I have been<br/>\na kind of interpreter for him in life...an interpreter of life to him and of<br/>\nhim to others in life. This has been needed less and less as he has gotten<br/>\nolder, but certainly was a necessity to get him to where he is today. And<br/>\nthat is completely okay. It is who he is and what he needed and that is<br/>\nunschooling in action.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe too seems &quot;immature&quot; in ways, and yet very insightful in others. This is<br/>\nperfectly perfect...our individual children are who they are, and<br/>\nunschooling philosophy allows us to see without a second&#39;s thought that<br/>\nthere is nothing &quot;wrong&quot; with who they are...if they were in public school<br/>\nwhere children are compared with each other, THEN there would be problems<br/>\nwith our &quot;outside the box&quot; kids. But they really aren&#39;t outside any box,<br/>\nthere is no box, the box is man-made and imaginary.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is completely reasonable, in my oh so humble opinion, to trust that your<br/>\ndaughter does not need your teaching if she does not want your teaching.<br/>\nEven though she looks different from your others, she still knows what she<br/>\nneeds more than you do. She may have more scattered skills than your other<br/>\nchildren, and that is okay. You will need to continue to learn about and<br/>\nunderstand your daughter, probably more consciously than your others, in<br/>\norder to truly support her in the ways that she needs. You may need to be<br/>\nmore a guide to appropriate public behavior for her than you need to be for<br/>\nyour others, you may need to be ready to show her something new in a<br/>\nmoment&#39;s notice more so than your others who may give you time and patience<br/>\nto gain more information. For instance, my guy once said to me &quot;How do you<br/>\nmake purple&quot; with great intensity and a desire to know right then. I jumped<br/>\nto it more quickly than I would have for my others, because I knew that he<br/>\nwould lose the moment more quickly than my others would have. Those<br/>\nconnection times are fewer and farther between with ds than with my other<br/>\nkids, who have relationships with me in relaxed ways all the time, and who<br/>\nhave the capacity to work and live more patiently, who seem to more believe<br/>\nthat all is well.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess I mostly want to encourage you to continue to know your daughter,<br/>\nto be okay with the fact that it is a different-looking path than with your<br/>\nother children, and that with that comes lessons that you may not have<br/>\nwanted to teach. For instance my 16 yo is driving, my 18 yo won&#39;t be able to<br/>\nfor a long time it appears. My 18 yo has watched his younger siblings<br/>\naccomplish many things, including having healthy friendships, before he did.<br/>\nThese are tough life lessons to watch as a parent, at least they were for<br/>\nme, and my guy has had pain that his sibs probably never will have...but at<br/>\nthe same he has great insight into things that his sibs don&#39;t have, he is<br/>\nintensely creative and sees things that others typically don&#39;t. He has<br/>\nopened my mind tremendously...<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep listening, watching, loving and supporting...<br/>\n<br/>\nJacki</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":259654066,"authorName":"rachel","from":"&quot;rachel&quot; &lt;boulier72@...&gt;","profile":"boulier72","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Nine is fine!

In","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1409282287\">I have a 9 yr old dd and my question posed to the group is regarding<br/>\nher. She is the 2nd of 4 children and quite different in many ways than<br/>\nmy other 3. In different I mean she has always been somewhat of an<br/>\nintrovert- very clingy as a baby, nursed for 2 solid years and refused<br/>\nsolid foods until she weaned, spoke very little until baby # 3 came<br/>\nalong (she was 2 1/2) and as of the present reads very little and<br/>\nstruggles to articulate herself. She is finally becoming much more<br/>\nverbal with others- so much so it struck me the other day when at a<br/>\nrestaurant she very bluntly blurted out what her selection for her meal<br/>\nwas going to be ( I usually order for her). She really is truly a<br/>\nbeautiful child and very similar, it seems, to my husband. He claims he<br/>\nwas very much the same as her as a child. She is quite artistic and very<br/>\npassionate about whatever she is working on. She frustrates easily<br/>\nthough when her siblings don&#39;t follow her rules for play and as of<br/>\nrecently she is very quick to correct and set straight what she sees as<br/>\nwrong or bothersome behavior. She seems at times lonely yet I really<br/>\nthink she is just intensely thinking. My problem is that I tire easily<br/>\ntrying to listen as she attempts to tell me things and I find it<br/>\ndifficult at times to be sensitive when she overreacts to situations<br/>\nthat irritate her. She seems rather immature on some level yet very self<br/>\nassured on others. I guess I just need some help understanding her. We<br/>\nare so different and I&#39;m not sure what she needs of me. I wonder if she<br/>\nfeels different than her siblings or other kids her age and if that is<br/>\ncausing her confusion & insecurity. She realizes reading is a useful<br/>\nskill she would like to have, but does not work very hard to build her<br/>\nability up. I suppose it&#39;s just not important to her enough yet, but as<br/>\nher 6 yr old sister is advancing and her 5 yr old brother showing much<br/>\ninterest I&#39;m worried this will cause more frustration for her. Does<br/>\nanyone have any suggestions for me in how I should relate to her or help<br/>\nher in anyway? Do I continue to stay out of the way or do try to guide<br/>\nher a little and how would I do that without insulting her intelligence?<br/>\nShe really doesn&#39;t want me to &quot;teach&quot; her anything and refuses to listen<br/>\nto me whenever my inner teacher shows up!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, Rachel</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28244,"nextTopicId":4172}}
