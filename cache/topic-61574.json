When they found out last year that we don&#39;t send our son to school, they&#39;ve been asking lots of questions about home education, especially the wife. She seems to be intrigued, and perhaps even would like to try it but there are a lot of things that make her thinks she can&#39;t do it. Lots of usual questions like socialisation, or how to cope with having children all the time at home, etc, I&#39;ve answered them as best I know. However, last easter she came up with more questions that I couldn&#39;t answer to her satisfaction because my knowledge is only as far as how it works in the UK. Things like: what about exams? What about getting a job? (They said you can&#39;t get a job in France without getting any qualification, hence the importance of passing exams). Is it possible to unschool in France? (I think they need to register and have evaluation yearly?) There were more questions but I can&#39;t remember.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been trying to find info for them but my french is very limited so not much I can offer, and even those sites I found, I&#39;m not confidence about the content.
