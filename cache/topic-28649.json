Lots to consider there.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thought that comes immediately to mind is this one: which principle (or<br/>\nmaybe &#39;philosophy&#39; is the better word) is going to take precedence? If<br/>\nUnschooling is first, then I will &#39;compromise&#39; on religious belief to be<br/>\ntrue to it. Alternatively, if my religion is first, then I will &#39;compromise&#39;<br/>\non Unschooling to be true to it. The reason I put the word &#39;compromise&#39; in<br/>\ninverted commas is that I think that there is a way of looking at two<br/>\ndifferent philosophies and yet finding commonality in them. For example, for<br/>\nme, freedom and respect for the personhood of a person, are very important<br/>\nvalues. I find expression of and support for freedom and respect in both<br/>\nUnschooling and Christianity. Hence the idea that it is possible to live as<br/>\na Christian Unschooling family. Yeeha! Thrashing out the reality is another<br/>\nmatter. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIf it comes down to brass tacks and I felt pushed into a stalemate where I<br/>\nhad to choose between the two, Christianity comes first. This is because<br/>\nthere is a sense of allegiance to Jesus as a living Lord, to Whom I have<br/>\nfreely given my life, so in that way my choices are now limited. In much the<br/>\nsame way as my choices were limited after my marriage to my husband in a way<br/>\nthat they weren&#39;t when I was single.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo yes, my children are growing up in an overtly Christian home. But no, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think they are feeling coerced (actually I asked 2 of them and they<br/>\nlooked at me as if I was crazy). The funny thing is that my oldest daughter<br/>\nsaid that she sometimes feels coerced by my strong feelings about education!<br/>\nShe doesn&#39;t feel like I give her freedom to choose a different path on that<br/>\none, and she says that in retrospect maybe she would have preferred to have<br/>\nbeen schooled. Now that is a real curved ball!!!! <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMany families as an ideal prefer to leave the options open for their<br/>\nchildren on all things. But can any of us honestly say that we do not<br/>\ninfluence our children in the context of our family culture? We have an<br/>\nidentity as a family after all. I don&#39;t think this is wrong. But where I do<br/>\nthink there is potential to go wrong is when we don&#39;t leave the option for a<br/>\nparticular member of the family to be different - on any issue, be it<br/>\nsomething as important as religion or environmental responsibility or<br/>\nsomething as seemingly unimportant as foods to eat, clothes to wear and<br/>\nchoice of music. And we must recognize the subtle ways as well as the overt<br/>\nways of getting people to do what we want, rather than respecting their<br/>\nfreedom to choose.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nChristianity makes sense to me. So does Unschooling. The challenge lies in<br/>\nhow to implement the concepts. All around me are people, in many cases<br/>\nimplementing one or another of the concepts dear to me. But maybe I don&#39;t<br/>\nagree with their implementation. Or maybe I try to implement something, but<br/>\nin a very short while I can see that it does not work. It is back to the<br/>\ndrawing board. Honest, rueful, apologetic assessment of where it went wrong.<br/>\nThe principle however remains. I am challenged to return again to the<br/>\nprinciple - study and consider and investigate ways that work.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRegards<br/>\n<br/>\nCathy<br/>\n<br/>\n.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":286686117,"authorName":"Melody Flurry","from":"Melody Flurry &lt;imagine1harmony@...&gt;","profile":"imagine1harmony","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Christians Unschooling?","postDate":"1178814476","msgId":28723,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgyNzI5Ny40MzkwNy5xbUB3ZWI1ODExNS5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDgxMzQyQjRGLUQ4NTEtNDlGQS1CQUNCLTcwNjA3RkQ3QUQ2QUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":28715,"nextInTopic":28749,"prevInTime":28722,"nextInTime":28724,"topicId":28649,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In case anyone wants to check it out, I thought I would post that there are discussion groups related to Christian unschooling where discussion of religious","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-542081321\">In case anyone wants to check it out, I thought I would post that there are discussion groups related to Christian unschooling where discussion of religious matters might be more appropriate.

(and whats even worse if we don&#39;t conform to that standard then we don&#39;t fit the &quot;right way&quot;!!)  <br/>\n<br/>\nMAN i know God as the first & ultimate unschooler! he gives us the freedom to explore His world, His creations,our relationship with him and nutures us right along in FREEDOM! INCLUDING the _choice_ to chose to believe in & follow Him or NOT.  i think of this in relation to what bob said <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Yes, indeed. If more schoolchildren knew the truth about what home <br/>\neducation can be, their parents might have to re-examine their <br/>\nbeliefs about a lot of things.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nthe truth is if one is truly intimate with God then one will know his character and principles is NOT about limits or control. yes there are guidelines yet they are simply for protection to accompany us on our learning journey,which He longs to be a part of! JUST like that role we play as an (unschooling) parent!  we nurture our relationship with our children and their journey of learning, because we love them, and because we love them we spend TIME with them and desire the fullest life for them by seeking their interests! it is our job as parents to protect them i mean _hello_ we don&#39;t want our kids to play in a busy highway because obviously its dangerous territory!  anyhow He&#39;s ALL about freedom and i think its been the best kept secret! LOL  He paid the price to SET us FREE, to encourage our dreams,to elevate and give the desires of OUR hearts. its NOT a one way street!! once your liberated by seeing what God&#39;s freedom brings,wow the whole world opens up!  it really so simple yet sooo many complicate it. yes if indeed the truth be known.<br/>\n<br/>\ni appreciate your honesty cathy about your fear. my sons are only 12 & 8. they truly made their own choice for their relationship with God each in their _own_ time. when they shared it with me, it was a beautiful moment knowing it was THEIR choice, and their relationship with God. they will have a different experience than i, because we are after all unique individuals. if they chose not to have a relationship with God later in their years that would be very hard yes, but i would have to respect their choice. <br/>\n<br/>\nwhich reminds me we were recently discussing this very subject. i can&#39;t remember exactly what triggered the conversation but during it i made a comment to my son that not everybody worships/believes in jesus and we have to respect that. he (my youngest) who is so very sensative and intimate with God (by which he most often teaches & humbles ME! LOL) was very passionately upset and asked &quot;WHY _wouldn&#39;t_ people believe in jesus, thats just stupid!! don&#39;t they know how awesome He is!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\ni see many parents constantly make the mistake to &quot;shove&quot; their beliefs onto their kids, only to see them rebel and then wonder why?  sometimes the child comes back to these beliefs but its usually after they&#39;ve had the freedom to explore the &quot;world&quot; yet unfortunately it caused much hurt to their (parent/child) relationship in the process. i encourage parents if you give them that freedom in the first place, you will avoid the hurt and be respected more. it all comes down to their choice, & their free will. what will be, will be....truly what do we control?? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nemmy<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.cafepress.com/emmytofa<br/>\nwww.emmytofa.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":259654066,"authorName":"Rachel","from":"&quot;Rachel&quot; &lt;boulier72@...&gt;","profile":"greenqueen72","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Christians Unschooling?","postDate":"1178645359","msgId":28700,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGYxcWMxZys0NDliQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxMDAwMWM3OGY5ZSRiYzczYWExMCQyNzVmY2Q0NEBncmFwaGljcz4="},"prevInTopic":28662,"nextInTopic":28712,"prevInTime":28699,"nextInTime":28701,"topicId":28649,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is my response to the question about whether you can be a Christian and also be an unschooler.

If you would allow me to share my<br/>\nexperience & thoughts...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are a Christian family of 6 who do not attend a church, but my DH<br/>\nand I are Christians- in the sense that we do believe God created the<br/>\nworld and provided redemption through Jesus (I know that sounds<br/>\nhorribly religious, but basically we believe the bible to be God&#39;s<br/>\nWord and His will).<br/>\n <br/>\nNow we spent the better part of our marriage, now in it&#39;s 13th year,<br/>\nattending church, serving there, talking about and teaching our<br/>\nchildren about God and making our decisions based on what we thought<br/>\nwas correct according to the bible or traditional thought. We no<br/>\nlonger attend church and have ceased stressing the bible so urgently<br/>\nin our home. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe do talk a lot about a responsibility to love one another and do<br/>\nwhat is right- for the betterment of us as individuals and a family &<br/>\nin order to help others achieve better. We speak a lot of social<br/>\ninjustices, politics, the FDA, the war, corruption, morality without<br/>\njudgment and honesty. The interesting thing is that since we have<br/>\ndiscontinued the &quot;training&quot; our children they really do not talk much<br/>\nabout biblical things as they used to. Prior to that I think the kids<br/>\nwould talk more about things related to church and the bible because<br/>\nit was what we were stressing. Duh... kids will mimic and aim to<br/>\nplease those in which they fear an opinion! I really don&#39;t want the<br/>\nkids to mimic me- i do want to be the best I can be, but I always tell<br/>\nthem I want them to be and do better. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the discussion of things that may pertain to religion or the such<br/>\ncome up I allow them to voice their opinion without forcing mine. God<br/>\nis a part of our lives as is everything. To many religious people that<br/>\nmight seem as if  we have done our kids a disservice and that they<br/>\nwill not grow up Godly because of our so called neglectfulnesses to<br/>\nthe Word. We now see how we were not fully using our own brains on<br/>\nmany issues and thanks to our own enlightenment (in which I personally<br/>\nthank God- cause I am a bit of a thickhead!) we are allowing our kids<br/>\nto learn without outside pressure. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe  have begun the unschooling process in ourselves. We have begun<br/>\nquestioning things and in so doing allowing our kids to think & learn<br/>\nfreely, even on this topic. My relationship with God is my<br/>\nrelationship and I now realize it to be rude and frankly unnecessary<br/>\nto force that down anyone&#39;s throats. I see that verse about &quot;training<br/>\nup your children&quot; quite differently. I feel what that truly means is<br/>\nto support and allow your kids to go in the way they know (within<br/>\ntheir hearts) and they will succeed- which is supportive of unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\n I am not worried or concerned about my children following God or<br/>\nChristianity per say because I know it is a choice everyone must make<br/>\non their own. Without manipulation, perhaps they will truly experience<br/>\nGod&#39;s love for them and mankind. Our decision to step away from church<br/>\nand indoctrination was also a decision to decide to find out for<br/>\nourselves what God really is to me. What I have found is that He is<br/>\nnot confined to our limited ideas of Him and He is wonderfully vast<br/>\nand loving and kind. I will not use fear of any kind to cause my kids<br/>\nto conform and I will fight everyone and everything that tries to do so. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo it is possible to be a Christian and unschool. Never anywhere have<br/>\nI found support for coercion, manipulation (may I say slavery!) in the<br/>\nBible. Why would anyone willingly choose to be led and controlled? I<br/>\ndecided to stand up for myself and trust my own heart and my primary<br/>\nmotivation is to entrust my kids to do the same. So far it&#39;s working. <br/>\n<br/>\n-Rachel</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":116488337,"authorName":"Gold Standard","from":"&quot;Gold Standard&quot; &lt;jacki@...&gt;","profile":"jackiknouse","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Re: cathy & a ?","postDate":"1178518232","msgId":28662,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHRUVDS0dEQUIuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNzcwMWM3OGZmYiRhOTdlNzlmMCQwMjAyYThjMEBDcmFpZz4="},"prevInTopic":28660,"nextInTopic":28700,"prevInTime":28661,"nextInTime":28663,"topicId":28649,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... mill ...

Listening to their insights and supporting<br/>\ntheir explorations has been key for us in freedom and unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand the idea that religion can feel like the core of one&#39;s life,<br/>\nand that it could be quite difficult not to share the wonders of it with<br/>\none&#39;s children daily. But I do wonder the effect on their true freedom. I&#39;m<br/>\nnot trying to be antagonistic, but this is sort of the crux of the religious<br/>\nunschooling question in my mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, if I may ask, I am curious how each one of your family members<br/>\ncame to unanimously agree to live as Christians. How old are your kids? When<br/>\nthey are younger, parents really do get to make decisions without much<br/>\nquestion or disagreement. Maybe that is where your family is? Or maybe they<br/>\nhave been exposed to the many possibilities with openness, and they have<br/>\nchosen Christianity for their lives?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe religious unschooling is a little like the strong convictions about<br/>\nTV/computers/video games being harmful and damaging in unschooling in my<br/>\nmind, and maybe I am offbase with that thinking. Having doctrine in my home<br/>\nabout anything, be it following commandments created thousands of years ago<br/>\nor espousing the evils of video games would impinge on my kids true freedom.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is very good in unschooling to question what I would do if one or<br/>\nmore of my kids chose a path that I strongly disagreed with. First question:<br/>\nWHY do I disagree? That is my issue to resolve. My disagreement will surely<br/>\nget in the way of our relationship. Short of choosing a path of murder or<br/>\nmayhem, there shouldn&#39;t be all that much that I couldn&#39;t support in my<br/>\nchildren&#39;s choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are the questions that come to me when I think of incorporating one<br/>\nreligion in an unschooling family.<br/>\n<br/>\nJacki<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":183568025,"authorName":"Bob Collier","from":"&quot;Bob Collier&quot; &lt;bobcollier@...&gt;","profile":"quaussiebob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: cathy & a ?","postDate":"1178505608","msgId":28660,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGYxbTNpOCs0M20wQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDRCOUM4RTUwLUU1MUUtNEY3RC04QTg0LTAxNzVENzZENzQyRkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":28657,"nextInTopic":28662,"prevInTime":28659,"nextInTime":28661,"topicId":28649,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... on ... that, ... children s ... is ... their ... homework ... financial ...

Didn&#39;t want to talk about it;<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to discuss it, just KNEW I was wrong. Now I ignore those kinds<br/>\nof people and stick to fruitful conversations with people, no matter how<br/>\nstructured, who respect me enough to really want to know why I don&#39;t agree<br/>\nwith the above statements, or in what way I don&#39;t agree with them. I don&#39;t<br/>\ncare if they end up not agreeing with me in the end if at least they will<br/>\nconsider my ideas!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI have realized that so many people are just so scared. They are afraid of<br/>\nmessing up in some way. It takes so much courage to trust God, your kids,<br/>\nyourself. Far easier on the surface to stick to accepted protocol.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI have discovered that all the above ideas are JUST NOT TRUE!!! And that<br/>\nwhen Jesus Christ said that He came to give life, and life more abundantly,<br/>\nHe meant what He said. Paul said that it was for freedom that Christ had set<br/>\nus free, and that we should not again allow ourselves to be bound by a yoke<br/>\nof slavery. He was talking about slavish application of Judaic law. I see<br/>\nparallels here too. Following rules and regulations makes people feel safe,<br/>\nas they then can fool themselves that they are no longer responsible for<br/>\ntheir actions. Ho hum..<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIn our family we unanimously agree to live as Christians, to copy the<br/>\nexample set for us by Jesus, and to follow the teachings of the Bible. This<br/>\nis like a huge, overriding rainbow, under which we revel and delight in the<br/>\nbeauty of our lives. The picture that means the most to me is of a huge,<br/>\nrich, delightful pasture, surrounded by a secure boundary fence. But the<br/>\npasture is HUGE and the boundary fence is not restrictive at all. In fact,<br/>\nthere is more freedom than we ever realized, and one goes deeper and deeper<br/>\ninto it. Using this picture has enabled me to speak about unschooling in<br/>\nconservative Christian contexts and be heard.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t experience conflict between the two philosophies, and so if some<br/>\nthink that that means we compromise, I suppose that is just tough. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been so excited and so grateful for the discoveries I have made, and<br/>\nJohn Holt is my hero! I have read all his books and my copies are underlined<br/>\nand scribbled in and I still don&#39;t feel I understand enough to leave them on<br/>\nthe shelf. And yet it has become normal to live this way, so much so that it<br/>\nfeels strange to think back on the days when I was asking &#39;Can a Christian<br/>\nbe an unschooler?&#39; and &#39;Can an unschooler be a Christian?&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nA tough question that I sometimes ask (I tend to put myself through the mill<br/>\non stuff) is how would I react if one of my kids didn&#39;t want to be a<br/>\nChristian anymore. I have to admit that that would be very tough for me, and<br/>\nthat it is important to me that my kids love Jesus and have their own<br/>\nrelationship with Him. I also know though that I would have to find the<br/>\ngrace somewhere to let them be - because I couldn&#39;t do otherwise and still<br/>\nbe true to myself. This does not mean that I would not have the right to<br/>\ndebate the subject furiously with them if they were willing to do so though.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI am about to leave for one of Kelly Marks &#39;Intelligent Horsemanship&#39; demos,<br/>\nand I am starting to run late, so I had better go.

We were always<br/>\nrelaxed/delight-directed homeschoolers, but after reading John Holt&#39;s &#39;How<br/>\nChildren Learn&#39; and &#39;How Children Fail&#39; in 2000, (and lurking for a while on<br/>\nSandra&#39;s radical unschooling list where everyone was frolicking in the deep<br/>\nend of the ocean, so it gave me confidence to think &#39;hey, let&#39;s test the<br/>\nwater here on the shallow end.), we took the plunge into unschooling and we<br/>\nhave never looked back. Of course, it is a constant and challenging learning<br/>\nexperience for me here in highly structured, hyper-testing orientated,<br/>\nconservative England, and I mess up a lot of the time, but the kids are<br/>\ngreat - so patient when they remind me that it is supposed to be their<br/>\nchoice.. Back off mom, we know what we need.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest daughter is now in South Africa, where she is the youngest<br/>\naspirant dancer of her ballet company, and where people are constantly<br/>\namazed that a 17 year old is so sure of what she wants and is so<br/>\nself-disciplined and self-directed, and is able to live so far from her<br/>\nfamily without falling apart.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond daughter is constantly mistaken for an 18 year old - again because<br/>\nshe is so confident and sure of herself, and of her goals and objectives. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey alone are sufficient evidence for me that unschooling really really<br/>\nreally works! I tell people everywhere, and I love seeing them spend time<br/>\nwith us and gradually become more relaxed and laid back in their home<br/>\neducation, even if they continue to follow their precious curriculum guides!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are Christians, and at times we get a lot of criticism, as many<br/>\nChristians feel that you cannot be both a Christian and an unschooler.<br/>\nInterestingly, many unschoolers also think so. I was so convinced by John<br/>\nHolt&#39;s writings that I determined to confront this perception - for myself<br/>\nand for my family. And ultimately for other people who would like to know.<br/>\nIt is a wonderful journey.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith regard to the TV issue, you may be amused to hear that in our family it<br/>\nwas daughter 2 who most strongly voted for us not to have one in our home<br/>\nright now. We keep horses, and we do all the care ourselves. She is the<br/>\nowner of three of the horses, so she has soooo much work to do every day. We<br/>\nlive on a small farm and there are always tasks to accomplish. Her concern<br/>\nwas that, even if we only watched 1 hour of TV per day, it would add up to 7<br/>\nhours/week - which is almost a full day&#39;s work!!!! What a dreadful waste of<br/>\ntime when we don&#39;t ever have enough time in the week to get everything done<br/>\nthat we want to do as it is. (she has visions of losing all her slave<br/>\nlabour!!!!) Everyone, except poor hubby - who wanted Sky TV so that he could<br/>\nwatch the sport - was won over by her argument and agreed! Thus a decision<br/>\nhas been made and the TV issue is to be reviewed again in a few months time.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne question that does come up regularly is to do with being part of and<br/>\nrelevant to our society - TV is a useful way of keeping some sort of track<br/>\nof what is considered important at any given time.<br/>\n<br/>\nA concern that I have is that I don&#39;t really want my 5 year old hearing<br/>\nabout all the gory bits of what paedophile/sex murderer/whoever got up to.<br/>\nThe BBC delights in hashing and rehashing these kinds of news items. Most<br/>\nrecently an English 3 year old was stolen from the bedroom in which she was<br/>\nsleeping - taken out of her bed by some swine who climbed in through the<br/>\nwindow. She hasn&#39;t been found yet. I feel sick myself at the thought, and I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think Kate needs to know about that right now. I would like her to<br/>\nexperience her world as a wonderful safe place, at least for these few short<br/>\nsweet years of early childhood. <br/>\n<br/>\nDear son, who is very aware of what money can buy, said that a SKY TV<br/>\nsubscription would not be the best use of our funds. He felt that we were<br/>\nbetter off continuing to have the money available to buy whatever we are<br/>\ninterested in at the time (currently it is beading, so we are always buying<br/>\nbeads). <br/>\n<br/>\nWe all enjoy watching TV a bit when we are on holiday, but on the whole we<br/>\nare not majorly impressed by most of the programming - about 80% of it we<br/>\ncan skip.

We were always<br/>\n  relaxed/delight-directed homeschoolers, but after reading John Holt&#39;s &#39;How<br/>\n  Children Learn&#39; and &#39;How Children Fail&#39; in 2000, (and lurking for a while on<br/>\n  Sandra&#39;s radical unschooling list where everyone was frolicking in the deep<br/>\n  end of the ocean, so it gave me confidence to think &#39;hey, let&#39;s test the<br/>\n  water here on the shallow end.), we took the plunge into unschooling and we<br/>\n  have never looked back. Of course, it is a constant and challenging learning<br/>\n  experience for me here in highly structured, hyper-testing orientated,<br/>\n  conservative England, and I mess up a lot of the time, but the kids are<br/>\n  great - so patient when they remind me that it is supposed to be their<br/>\n  choice.. Back off mom, we know what we need.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My oldest daughter is now in South Africa, where she is the youngest<br/>\n  aspirant dancer of her ballet company, and where people are constantly<br/>\n  amazed that a 17 year old is so sure of what she wants and is so<br/>\n  self-disciplined and self-directed, and is able to live so far from her<br/>\n  family without falling apart.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Second daughter is constantly mistaken for an 18 year old - again because<br/>\n  she is so confident and sure of herself, and of her goals and objectives. <br/>\n<br/>\n  They alone are sufficient evidence for me that unschooling really really<br/>\n  really works! I tell people everywhere, and I love seeing them spend time<br/>\n  with us and gradually become more relaxed and laid back in their home<br/>\n  education, even if they continue to follow their precious curriculum guides!<br/>\n<br/>\n  We are Christians, and at times we get a lot of criticism, as many<br/>\n  Christians feel that you cannot be both a Christian and an unschooler.<br/>\n  Interestingly, many unschoolers also think so. I was so convinced by John<br/>\n  Holt&#39;s writings that I determined to confront this perception - for myself<br/>\n  and for my family. And ultimately for other people who would like to know.<br/>\n  It is a wonderful journey.<br/>\n<br/>\n  With regard to the TV issue, you may be amused to hear that in our family it<br/>\n  was daughter 2 who most strongly voted for us not to have one in our home<br/>\n  right now. We keep horses, and we do all the care ourselves. She is the<br/>\n  owner of three of the horses, so she has soooo much work to do every day. We<br/>\n  live on a small farm and there are always tasks to accomplish. Her concern<br/>\n  was that, even if we only watched 1 hour of TV per day, it would add up to 7<br/>\n  hours/week - which is almost a full day&#39;s work!!!! What a dreadful waste of<br/>\n  time when we don&#39;t ever have enough time in the week to get everything done<br/>\n  that we want to do as it is. (she has visions of losing all her slave<br/>\n  labour!!!!) Everyone, except poor hubby - who wanted Sky TV so that he could<br/>\n  watch the sport - was won over by her argument and agreed! Thus a decision<br/>\n  has been made and the TV issue is to be reviewed again in a few months time.<br/>\n<br/>\n  One question that does come up regularly is to do with being part of and<br/>\n  relevant to our society - TV is a useful way of keeping some sort of track<br/>\n  of what is considered important at any given time.<br/>\n<br/>\n  A concern that I have is that I don&#39;t really want my 5 year old hearing<br/>\n  about all the gory bits of what paedophile/sex murderer/whoever got up to.<br/>\n  The BBC delights in hashing and rehashing these kinds of news items. Most<br/>\n  recently an English 3 year old was stolen from the bedroom in which she was<br/>\n  sleeping - taken out of her bed by some swine who climbed in through the<br/>\n  window. She hasn&#39;t been found yet. I feel sick myself at the thought, and I<br/>\n  don&#39;t think Kate needs to know about that right now. I would like her to<br/>\n  experience her world as a wonderful safe place, at least for these few short<br/>\n  sweet years of early childhood. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Dear son, who is very aware of what money can buy, said that a SKY TV<br/>\n  subscription would not be the best use of our funds. He felt that we were<br/>\n  better off continuing to have the money available to buy whatever we are<br/>\n  interested in at the time (currently it is beading, so we are always buying<br/>\n  beads). <br/>\n<br/>\n  We all enjoy watching TV a bit when we are on holiday, but on the whole we<br/>\n  are not majorly impressed by most of the programming - about 80% of it we<br/>\n  can skip. I think I can honestly say that none of us feels like we are<br/>\n  missing out. <br/>\n<br/>\n  What we did instead was buy a digital projector so that we could set up big<br/>\n  screen media in the lounge, and we have a subscription to hire DVD&#39;s and we<br/>\n  also buy quite a lot of DVD&#39;s. If anyone wants to watch something, it goes<br/>\n  on the list and we get it. We also like hooking the computer onto the<br/>\n  digital projector and messing around on the internet together. Finally, the<br/>\n  kids also go through intense stages where they love playing racing games on<br/>\n  the playstation (again on the big screen), although I really DO think that<br/>\n  this is one huge waste of time - and what is more, it makes me seasick to<br/>\n  watch!!!~! <br/>\n<br/>\n  Regards<br/>\n<br/>\n  Cathy<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____ <br/>\n<br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>]<br/>\n  On Behalf Of Sandra Dodd<br/>\n  Sent: 05 May 2007 02:15 AM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: Re: Validity (was Re: [AlwaysLearning] TV)<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-Maybe &quot;valid decision&quot; was the wrong phrase to use!
