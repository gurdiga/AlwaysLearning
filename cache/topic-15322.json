Pediatric<br/>\ngrowth charts have been used by pediatricians, nurses, and parents to track<br/>\nthe growth of infants, children, and adolescents in the United States since<br/>\n1977. The 1977 growth charts were developed by the National Center for<br/>\nHealth Statistics (NCHS) as a clinical tool for health professionals to<br/>\ndetermine if the growth of a child is adequate. The 1977 charts were also<br/>\nadopted by the World Health Organization for international use.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the 1977 NCHS growth charts were first developed, NCHS recommended that<br/>\nthey be revised periodically as necessary. With more recent and<br/>\ncomprehensive national data now available, along with improved statistical<br/>\nprocedures, the 1977 growth charts were revised and updated to make them a<br/>\nmore valuable clinical tool for health professionals. The 2000 CDC growth<br/>\ncharts represent the revised version of the 1977 NCHS growth charts. Most of<br/>\nthe data used to construct these charts come from the National Health and<br/>\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which has periodically collected<br/>\nheight and weight and other health information on the American population<br/>\nsince the early 1960&#39;s.<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":96795689,"authorName":"Tuckervill@aol.com","from":"Tuckervill@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Growth charts question","postDate":"1056402986","msgId":15322,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1LjE0MGFiZjM1LjJjMjhjODJhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":15323,"prevInTime":15321,"nextInTime":15323,"topicId":15322,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Someone on another list wants the answer to this question.
