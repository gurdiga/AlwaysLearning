I&#39;ve spoken in depth with two new, emerging unschooling moms who are at this minute bringing their children home from school.  It&#39;s been so energizing for me (we&#39;ve been homeschooling loosely, and then unschooling for 6 years now) to talk with new people and see all the potential for such a richer and better life.  It&#39;s very exciting, and you have such an exciting time ahead of you with all the new depth that is there for you to discover.  Life is so much more fun than school!<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It doesn&#39;t help that my youngest&#39;s teacher asked why I was doing it so close to the end of the year, that she thought it was a bad idea to start now.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy?  Is it because you won&#39;t teach your daughter to follow through?  Or the inconsistency will be bad for her?  Or...  OMG!  None of that matters.  What you are actually doing is showing your daughter that you love her and are willing to support her even though her teacher (read:  authority) doesn&#39;t approve.  Taking her out (assuming that she wants to be at home) is a more powerful message of saying yes to life than it would be to wait until the end of the year.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps the teacher feels like it would send a bad message to everyone else to see someone simply choose to keep their child at home.  What if everyone else with unhappy children were to get this crazy notion?  Where would her job be?  Scary.   :-)  It would be so much easier if you just quietly disappeared and didn&#39;t come back.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun!!  Eat ice cream for breakfast.  Watch a movie before lunch.

It might be that long before they  <br/>\ncan even begin to really want to explore anything that might seem  <br/>\n&quot;academic&quot; at all, and that&#39;s IF you&#39;re able to totally deschool that  <br/>\nwhole time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/deschooling\">http://sandradodd.com/deschooling</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSo plan on six months of summer vacation, on 180 Saturdays all in a row!<br/>\n<br/>\nFun ones. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":299167699,"authorName":"lbgjones","from":"&quot;lbgjones&quot; &lt;lindajones@...&gt;","profile":"lbgjones","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Last day in Public School...","postDate":"1240606206","msgId":44275,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdzdDhsdStxN2k5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":44277,"prevInTime":44274,"nextInTime":44276,"topicId":44275,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well, I ve finally done it - today is the last day of school for my 8 & 9 year old.

Now that the time has come, I&#39;m having some last minute fears (you know, is this the right thing to do, will I be able to do it, etc, etc).  It doesn&#39;t help that my youngest&#39;s teacher asked why I was doing it so close to the end of the year, that she thought it was a bad idea to start now.  As is usually the case with me, when confronted I can never remember all of the arguments for my position.  So I&#39;m feeling a little doubt.  Plus, we told the in-laws this weekend and they had a ton of questions about my ability and socialization, blah, blah, blah.  I try to ignore them - I know it really doesn&#39;t matter what anyone else thinks - but it&#39;s really hard not to second guess myself about homeschooling, much less unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I guess I just need some words of encouragement please.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44295,"nextTopicId":44288}}
