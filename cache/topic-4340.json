I am a terminal worrier about lateness.  Although, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t seem to require it of folks coming to my house : )  I do try to think <br/>\nahead about where we need to go and how much needs to get into the car before <br/>\nwe leave, etc.  I find that the times that are the worst are when I&#39;ve let <br/>\nthe girls to &quot;just one more thing, Mom.&quot;  Of course, we move at different <br/>\nspeeds and I get more and more volcano-ish.  Not a pretty sight.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd money... that is a whole new stress area.  I go through weeks where I can <br/>\njust think philosophically about the fact that we are just making the <br/>\npayments.  And then some horrid bill comes in that I had not <br/>\nanticipated...like dh&#39;s car breaks down (again) or his yearly professional <br/>\nmembership renewal ($187 and required for him to keep his OT license in the <br/>\nstate)  is due.  Then I go from bitchin&#39; and moanin&#39; to nearly crying at the <br/>\ncontinual stress level regarding money.

I <br/>\ncan usually short circuit the stress and my bad behavior by identifiying <br/>\nexactly what the pressure is.  I am chronically, pathologically early--I <br/>\nhate to be late for anything.  This causes a lot of time-coercion in my <br/>\nlife, as you can imagine.  (My husband is chronically late, but he just <br/>\nthinks it&#39;s because he&#39;s an optimist.  i.e., he thinks he can get more <br/>\ndone than he actually can. :)  So when I feel the time crunch and start <br/>\nhurrying Will, I try to remind myself that it&#39;s OKAY to be on time.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n(Interestingly, when it comes to a project or job, I work better under <br/>\ndeadline pressure, and often save the largest and most creative tasks <br/>\nfor the last minute.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe money-coercion thing I handle best by planning ahead for everything, <br/>\nand using Quicken.  :)  I put money-to-blow right there in the budget <br/>\n(luckily we generally have some to blow).  It usually goes for the Big <br/>\nKid meal on the way home from the skating rink, when Will is <br/>\ndemonstrating the hungry-uglies because he should have eaten something <br/>\nbesides cookies for breakfast, or stuff like that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if you can remember that it&#39;s not the kids, it&#39;s the time or money <br/>\nthat&#39;s making you stress out, you&#39;re one step closer to happy childhood.<br/>\n<br/>\nTuck</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":70914754,"authorName":"Cheryl Flohe","from":"Cheryl Flohe &lt;cheryl98178@...&gt;","profile":"cheryl98178","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Digest Number 209","postDate":"1013035662","msgId":4340,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwMjA2MjI0NzQyLjU2NTgucW1haWxAd2ViMTQ0MDcubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMTMwMzQxNjcuMTAxNDUuMzIzOTIubTlAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4380,"prevInTime":4339,"nextInTime":4341,"topicId":4340,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... his own business so he bought an old truck and a half dozen garbage cans and now operates a thriving poop-scooping business, where people pay a monthly fee","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1051680627\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&gt;I know a guy here in our town who desperately wanted<br/>\n </span></blockquote>his own business so he bought an old truck and a half<br/>\ndozen garbage cans and now operates a thriving<br/>\npoop-scooping business, where people pay a monthly fee<br/>\nand he comes and cleans up after their dogs.
