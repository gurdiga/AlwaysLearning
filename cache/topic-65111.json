Going to the afterschool program enables him to see kids everyday 4-5 days a week. <br/>\nI spoke with the director who said they have a zero tolerance policy. She asked that I let her speak with the parents and the boy. She also told the leader in the room that day to speak to the boy. While I filled out the incident report, my son went into the room. He told the boy that he didn&#39;t appreciate being called that name and told on him. The boy laughed and said,  I didn&#39;t say that.&quot; Then he said it doesn&#39;t matter because his parents weren&#39;t going to say anything anyway. He felt better because he said something and stood up to this *16* y/o.<br/>\nMy son likes Sandra&#39;s idea of trying to find something else he can do. They have a martial arts class 2 days a week. Its only an hour per session but he&#39;s interested. The local library just started a teen craft program and an anime club once a month so we&#39;ll add those.<br/>\nWe appreciate everyones advice.

Maybe he’s misguided and thinks he’s being cool or funny when he uses that word.  Maybe he doesn’t have much guidance or help from parents.  Maybe he doesn’t have very nice parents.

If your son was willing to be there, I would encourage him.  If not, I would arrange to talk while he was occupied.  At that meeting, I would encourage the organization to have anti-hate literature posted.  Here is an example of posters I have seen around our community:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bikeithaca.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/United-Against-Hate-poster-PDF.pdf\">http://bikeithaca.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/United-Against-Hate-poster-PDF.pdf</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI think you can print that one as an example.  I would also ask that it be written clearly in the class agreement that bullying and actions of hate of any sort will not be tolerated.  If the people in charge of the program were not open to discussing these changes, I would write a letter to he editor of the local paper, and I would let the organization know I was doing so. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know it is not at all your responsibility to educate bullies or racists, but I do believe it would help your son feel empowered and not victimized to see you work toward a resolution that allows him to feel safe in his community.  I would also ask my son if he wanted me to stay present during the class.  If so, I would.  If not, I would ask an instructor to keep a closer eye on the situation.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have permission to post this and the mom says it didn&#39;t need to be anonymous.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi Sandra,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am new to the list and usually read and learn.

It&#39;s not likely to be a peaceful environment for anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if that action would be illegal in an adult, maybe you could state that.  Find out what the policies of the center are about harrassment, and maybe they will remove that boy from the program.  But there&#39;s only one or two days left, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-.

You could think of not doing something your son doesn&#39;t want, but as a mother I would have a hard time standing by while my child took more abuse.  Yet much of the sports world and military training and fraternities involve systemic abuse and belittling (and worse) and mothers&#39; sons voluntarily participate in those things all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think if my child were willing not to return, I would write a letter to the director with a copy to the parents of that boy, say he wasn&#39;t coming back, and state clearly why.  I would tell them they need to take better care of what&#39;s going on with kids there, and have better supervision. <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t be surprised if they pull the &quot;sensitive homeschooler&quot; move on you.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Racial Hatred problem","postDate":"1326991973","msgId":65111,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZFM0U0RkUwLTJBRkItNENEMi05QzY3LTQ4ODlCNTEwNTQzQkBTYW5kcmFEb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":65112,"prevInTime":65110,"nextInTime":65112,"topicId":65111,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have permission to post this and the mom says it didn t need to be anonymous.
