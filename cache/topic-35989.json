Do you think that she <br/>\nwas implying that you were consuming happiness by arguing with her, or that she was <br/>\nconsuming happiness in trying to coerce her children?  If it&#39;s the second, then no response <br/>\nseems necessary, and if it&#39;s the first, then that&#39;s a pretty strong statement of &quot;leave me <br/>\nalone,&quot; and I would if it were me.  It doesn&#39;t seem like she&#39;s likely to be very receptive to <br/>\nyour point of view.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr is she talking about children who don&#39;t do chores that are consuming happiness?  If the <br/>\nanswer is door number 3, then I&#39;d still leave it alone, because if, after all the reasons <br/>\nyou&#39;ve likely expressed about why she shouldn&#39;t rag on her kids, she&#39;s posted that quote, I <br/>\nthink she&#39;s dug in her heels for the moment.  Maybe just backing off and seeing if the <br/>\nseeds will grow might be a better use of your emotional energy.  At some point, she may <br/>\ndecide she doesn&#39;t like the sound of her own voice and your words will come to mind.  If <br/>\nshe is a very proud person, it may be hard for her to jump on board right away with you <br/>\nwatching so closely.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe may need to have a little time for self-examination.  You can always continue to post <br/>\npositive things on your blog, even if they don&#39;t reflect a specific answer to this quote--<br/>\nbecause just the tone of loving and appreciating your children for who they are is going to <br/>\nnag at her!  She&#39;d probably like to feel that and doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":321346721,"authorName":"barbara emrich","from":"&quot;barbara emrich&quot; &lt;barbaraemrich@...&gt;","profile":"barbaraemrich","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] hello and thoughts","postDate":"1214786862","msgId":36008,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg3ZTkxOWI2MDgwNjI5MTc0N3k3ZTExMjA3ajdlM2E3ODhiMGZkNGUyMzRAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGc0OGdnditwNXJyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGc0OGdnditwNXJyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":35996,"nextInTopic":36016,"prevInTime":36007,"nextInTime":36009,"topicId":35989,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t know if I could come up with a response to this quote without first having your friend explain what SHE thinks it means.
