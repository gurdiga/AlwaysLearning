Sorry..I can <br/>\nramble at times.<br/>\nThanks for the reply.<br/>\nWe actually wanted their whole family to come too.  My SIL, niece and <br/>\nnephew.  But that wasn&#39;t the plan for them.  It all worked out in the <br/>\nend.  My dd decide to go with my niece (fly) and they will come back <br/>\nthe day before Easter.  And we&#39;re going in Feb.<br/>\nI&#39;m glad I was sensative to her feelings.
