I <br/>\nwas raised in the Religious Science church, a &quot;New Thought&quot; religion, <br/>\nwhere we believed our thoughts controlled the universe around us.  It&#39;s <br/>\na terrifying thing for a child.  Kids should be free to think whatever <br/>\nthoughts arise, to examine them, enjoy them, reject them, as they <br/>\nchoose.  To be told we have to watch what we *think* when our young <br/>\nimaginations run wild, beyond our control, is too great a burden for a <br/>\nchild.
