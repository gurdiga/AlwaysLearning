You have both reminded me that I need to be doing this more. I do do it often, but other times we (my son and I) are really into something and I forget and then it&#39;s too late. One thing that has helped is that my husband has recently started coming home at a regular time, so that makes it easier for me because I know when we can expect him.<br/>\n<br/>\n*I don&#39;t think it is terribly uncommon as a reaction, though. It probably is<br/>\nbecause daddy coming home means his play will be interrupted and your<br/>\nattention taken away.*<br/>\n<br/>\nI get this. Jay (my husband) and I talked about it. We usually limit our conversation down to a bare minimum when he comes home, in the hope that Sam doesn&#39;t associate Daddy coming in with himself losing out. I make a point to stay as focussed as I can on Sam and whatever we&#39;re doing. It seems to work ok from Sam&#39;s point of view, but not from Jay&#39;s.

Something along the lines of grabbing my husband and hugging him like a teddy bear and saying, “That’s okay, I love daddy enough for the both of us.” or something else that makes everyone laugh but makes it perfectly clear that it is NOT okay to talk to daddy that way.*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie your post just came through while I was re-reading the above.

At first, I asked her not to say it but that didn’t work. I know my husband did not want to come home or walk into a room and hear that stuff so we talked about things that we could do. One of the things that worked was for him to scoop our daughter up and shower her with attention. She would be laughing while saying “I hate you Daddy”. Rather than taking it personally,  my husband turned it into a game. I a not sure how to explain it but we think that our daughter was rejecting dad because dad was going to work and she didn’t want him to. At various points during the day, she will talk about wanting daddy home but then when he gets home she gets mad and rejects him. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome things that we have done to make a big deal out of daddy’s arrival:<br/>\n<br/>\n-The girls and I have walked down to the end of the driveway and greeted him so we could ride up the driveway with him.<br/>\n<br/>\n-The girls and I have hidden from dad so that he had to find us when he got home. Dad was in on it so he knew that we were hiding. It was fun and the girls were all tickled over it because my husband is so good at acting surprised and scared and the girls think it is hilarious. <br/>\n<br/>\n-We have cooked fancy dinners and had them waiting on dad.<br/>\n<br/>\n-If the kids don’t acknowledge dad, I will try to shower him with attention.<br/>\n<br/>\n-When my husband leaves work, he usually calls me and I make sure to let the kids know that dad is on his way home. I build it up because I genuinely look forward to my husband coming home every day. <br/>\n<br/>\n-If we have done anything super cool during the day, I build up the fact that I can’t wait to share it with dad. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile my husband doesn’t like it when the younger ones say “I hate you” or other negative stuff, he recognizes that it is a phase and he doesn’t take it personally. The reason that he is able to not take it personally is because I have worked really hard to build him up. I will also interfere on his behalf. I try to do it playfully. Something along the lines of grabbing my husband and hugging him like a teddy bear and saying, “That’s okay, I love daddy enough for the both of us.” or something else that makes everyone laugh but makes it perfectly clear that it is NOT okay to talk to daddy that way. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":504505579,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] How to stop a 5-year old to yell at strangers that give her praise","postDate":"1341000008","msgId":68021,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBT09UYVhPdTNfeEc0V0ZuQmpzS0ViZy1oV1NMWVNnWVg2cGlHV2ZiakMwV2hMLWlmQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDFERTM3QUMwLTA3M0UtNEFCQS1CRjg2LTYwQTZDNThCQjY2MEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGpzanZmaCt0cHA4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8MTM0MDk4MTg1My45MTE0My5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViMjk2MDUubWFpbC5pcmQueWFob28uY29tPgk8MURFMzdBQzAtMDczRS00QUJBLUJGODYtNjBBNkM1OEJCNjYwQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68019,"nextInTopic":68023,"prevInTime":68020,"nextInTime":68022,"topicId":68009,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

If you have a little notice when you&#39;re out, remind her again - Mrs So-and-so is coming, remember to tell her you&#39;re a cat today. Reminders can help a lot!
