We feel that we are home.<br/>\nLove it. Andy is signed up for their first-ever week-long Vacation RE<br/>\nCamp in August, which will involve 3 hours each day of singing,<br/>\nactivities, guest speakers, art, blah blah. He made the choice to sign<br/>\nup for it; I&#39;ll take him and hang out there, and he can participate as<br/>\nhe chooses. And if he changes his mind about going, he won&#39;t go. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis fall he&#39;ll be old enough to attend the RE classes on Sunday<br/>\nmornings. I have a feeling he may prefer to stay in the playroom<br/>\ninstead. I am not going to force him to go to a class, and I will<br/>\noffer to go with him if he wants to check it out. <br/>\n<br/>\nEven if he doesn&#39;t attend any classes, our church regularly discusses<br/>\nworld religions and different belief systems and encourages tolerance<br/>\nand respect. So he&#39;s picking up on that, and already getting a base of<br/>\ninformation about different choices and directions. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe live our beliefs each day, and just by being around people at<br/>\nchurch and talking with them and interacting with them, Andy is<br/>\nexposed to them too.
