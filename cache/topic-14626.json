This was to me, the most shocking 60 <br/>\nminutes ever aired on TV! About 20 people got off the bus and the <br/>\ncameras followed these people throughout the store. Each person <br/>\nsystematcally filled their carts with everything you could imagine, <br/>\ngroceries, film, pet needs, baby goods, cleaners, toiletries, etc. <br/>\nThen one by one they went to the cashier and had their orders rung <br/>\nup. The smallest order was in the neighborhood of $600.00. They are <br/>\nall members of a program at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wrldofproducts.com\">http://www.wrldofproducts.com</a> One by one <br/>\nthey presented the coupons that they receive from this program and <br/>\nthe deducutions began. The most anyone had to pay was $19.66 and even <br/>\nthat person had an overflowing cart! I joined this program minutes <br/>\nafter the show aired and I still can&#39;t believe my eyes when week <br/>\nafter week I leave the supermarket with a full cart of products for <br/>\nnext to nothing!<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: Here is the link to their family network of sites: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.networkofsavings.com\">http://www.networkofsavings.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14385,"nextTopicId":14634}}
