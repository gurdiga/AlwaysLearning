Maybe it&#39;s because my kids don&#39;t have a total lack of eye contact all the time, but occasionally in certain situations where they&#39;re nervous or uncomfortable or don&#39;t know what to say.  I am rethinking that because of this discussion, though.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOr sometimes my younger son, who isn&#39;t shy in new situations, doesn&#39;t look up or greet someone because he&#39;s engrossed in what he&#39;s doing.

I gave the example of talking with my son about things that would make his interview go smoother, things the employer is likely to be looking for.  And honestly, it might&#39;ve been an oversight on my part, but I don&#39;t think I mentioned eye contact!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to talk to my son about this and see if it&#39;s information that he hadn&#39;t considered and would&#39;ve found valuable and helpful had I shared it.  (Not being facetious even though that sentence could be read as such.)  He already knows there are certain behaviors that are expected and accepted by society.  I&#39;ve done what I could, and what he&#39;s wanted, to help him.

It was an amazing experience overall, but during one of the closing ceremonies, the leader asked us to turn to the person sitting next to us and gaze directly into her eyes while we sang a song.  I found it almost unbearable, I was so uncomfortable.  In fact, I couldn&#39;t do it.  I fidgeted and twitched and shifted in my seat, and probably lost eye contact more than I maintained it.  Thoughts like &quot;I wonder if she&#39;s as uncomfortable as I am&quot; and &quot;I bet she wishes she had a different partner&quot; raced through my head, completely wiping away any notice of the song and its lyrics or the leader&#39;s intended meaning of the exercise.  When it was finished, I was sooo relieved, only to hear the leader say, &quot;Now turn the person on your other side&quot; and we were to do it all over again.  The only reason I didn&#39;t get up and leave is because I didn&#39;t want my partner to feel badly. I&#39;m pretty sure it &quot;screwed with my hormonal soup&quot; - because I remember very physical reactions as well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\nwww.piscesgrrrl.blogspot.com<br/>\n*****<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":255893983,"authorName":"piscesgrrl@aeroinc.net","from":"&quot;piscesgrrl@...&quot; &lt;piscesgrrl@...&gt;","profile":"piscesgrrl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"RE: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: A need to &quot;coach&quot; more concentration?","postDate":"1245687842","msgId":46005,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY5ODFiZjE2NGZlOTRiYzNhZDczOWNjNTA2OTRlNzdiLnBpc2Nlc2dycmxAYWVyb2luYy5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":46007,"prevInTime":46004,"nextInTime":46006,"topicId":46005,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

(There was recently a rather rousing discussion of just such a thing - in that case, giving personal information over the internet - on the UWWG list.)  Like anything else, it might become useful and pertinent information at some point for some kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest at 16 is rather shy and while he has several very good friends he finds it difficult to navigate interactions with people he doesn&#39;t know well.  We&#39;ve talked about it occasionally, when he&#39;s especially bothered that an encounter felt awkward or when I noticed something I thought would be helpful to share.  Most recently I was able to share my insight that while he feels nervous and shy, his body language sometimes, instead, suggests he&#39;s disinterested in the person.  Or rude.  That&#39;s not how he wants to be seen, so we talked about it.  I was able to share my observations and suggestions in a way that he didn&#39;t find threatening, because I&#39;ve not pressured him to change.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if I&#39;d been pressuring him for years and years to make eye contact with every person he encounters, I&#39;m certain it would&#39;ve done very little in the way of making him more comfortable yet far more in the way of creating resentment toward me for pushing him out of his comfort zone in a way that isn&#39;t helpful and partnering.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my son went to his first job interview, we talked about what the employer might be looking for.  He got the job.  We didn&#39;t have to spend years practicing making eye contact or shaking hands or dressing appropriately for an interview or ending his interview with &quot;thank you for considering me.&quot;  The information was relevant and desired and he nailed it on the first try.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we worry about society&#39;s expectations, about how our children will be seen by others, we place more importance on the feelings of others and less on the needs of our child. Most of the time my son is quite satisfied to have his few close friends and doesn&#39;t feel the need to belong in every circle of teens he meets.  I admit it&#39;s been a process for me to see that as perfectly ok, since as a teen (and, well, an adult) I was the opposite and sought ways to jump into every swirl.  I try to help my son be happy the way he wants to be happy, not how I - or especially others - think he should.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\nwww.piscesgrrrl.blogspot.com<br/>\n*****<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45998,"nextTopicId":45964}}
