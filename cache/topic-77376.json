While I had the traditional visual vs auditory vs kinesthetic learning methods in mind, I didn&#39;t really understand what those meant on a deeper level.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I want to learn something new, my first instinct is to take a class or get a stack of books on the subject. From a very early age, this is what the kids would get from me if they showed any interest in learning something new. It took me longer than I&#39;d like to admit, but it eventually dawned on me how counterproductive this was with these particular kids. Once I eased up (and we let go of technology restrictions), they gravitated towards the learning methods that work best for them. They play tons of games and watch hours of YouTube videos. They prefer to use apps to learn things like music and languages as opposed to in-person classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEven as I relaxed into helping them learn how they wanted, I still felt they needed more &quot;real life&quot; experiences to become well-rounded individuals. I generally needed to plan something super-sparkly-spectacular to even get them out of the house, and then they&#39;d be unimpressed with whatever we were doing and clamoring to go home. For example, I got tickets to take Owen (11) to an air show. He is obsessed with planes and has amassed an impressive amount of knowledge of them. He was excited to go, but it took a little coaxing to get him out of the house (he doesn&#39;t do well with crowds and was worried about it being too crowded). We got there, found our seats right next to the runway, and watched a Raptor VTOL helicopter do its thing. I expected him to be enthralled to see this *right here* in front of him, in real life! I sure was. But after about 20 minutes, he was asking to go home.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI was a little disappointed because I wanted to watch the rest of the show, but I knew he wouldn&#39;t last four more hours. As we were walking to the car, I mentioned my surprise that he didn&#39;t seem very interested in seeing all those planes do their thing up close. He replied that he could see all these planes and more on YouTube, and those videos let you see the controls, the pilot&#39;s view and a bunch of other stuff beyond what the plane looks like from the ground. And he can go into WarThunder or GTA V and fly those planes himself. I almost smacked my forehead with my palm b/c this was such an a-ha moment. I would much prefer seeing things in person rather than on a video, but for Owen, the learning and fun he could pull from his computer was so much richer, he didn&#39;t want to waste time sitting in the hot sun on a hard plastic chair at the air show. He wanted to go home and fly those planes himself!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is one example of a layer we&#39;ve pulled off our unschooling onion (there are more, but I think I&#39;ve used up my word quota for this message!).

The replies so far have been very joyful which is as you would expect from seasoned unschoolers.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whenever I&#39;ve felt shaky along the way it usually had to do with my ideals or expectations being out of kilter with the everyday realities of unschooling. I&#39;ve come up with a few ideals vs reality examples (well what has been my reality anyway) that could be helpful for people not at the very start but not quite there yet in terms of everything flowing as best as it could.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ideals vs reality</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ideal: We will unschool with a supportive unschooling community.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Reality: Whilst there is fantastic support online thanks to people like Sandra, Joyce &amp; Pam you might be it in terms of local unschoolers at least initially. Don&#39;t let that put you off as it takes time to build community &amp; facebook is a great way to seek out like minded families. Also be open to the fact that you won&#39;t be living in an unschooling bubble. Just as your friends aren&#39;t necessarily all unschoolers it&#39;s possible that your kids will make friends with school kids, home-ed kids, online friends who may live far away, kids from sports, so not all unschoolers basically. Seek out social connections as needed but don&#39;t fret that they need a huge amount of &quot;friends&quot; like school kids as a couple might do. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ideal: We will do lots of cool and interesting things together </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Reality: Your idea of cool &amp; interesting may be entirely different from that of your children. Keep exposing them to new &amp; interesting stuff but if your child would prefer to watch anime &amp; game online rather than take a walk in nature for eg then go from those interests &amp; see where that takes you rather than being frustrated trying to lure them towards something else that you think is more interesting or better for them. It&#39;s finding that balance between strewing new possible interests/activities &amp; supporting the things they already love &amp; having downtime too, just being &amp; resting. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ideal: As a family we will have freedom to go out &amp; explore together.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Reality: If you have more than one child they won&#39;t always want to go to the same places or do the same activities. You might have one child who vetoes lots of your ideas or likes to stay home a lot &amp; others that prefer being out. You might spontaneously decide that the weather is perfect to explore rockpools but the kids would prefer to skype their friends or one wants to go &amp; the other doesn&#39;t. You need to find creative ways to balance everyone&#39;s needs. It&#39;s tricky &amp; can be deflating sometimes when you think something would be new &amp; fun for everyone but it really just highlights the individual differences between your kids. They are all unique &amp; it&#39;s important to respect that. Being out all the time doesn&#39;t necessarily equate to more learning. Sandra wrote about balancing new &amp; comfortable.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ideal: As a close unschooling family where the kids aren&#39;t separated because of school, the kids will all enjoy being together.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Reality: This is a reasonable ideal because I would guess that most siblings in unschooled families would for the most part get on but certainly not all of the time. They will still argue, annoy each other, fued over stuff etc but that&#39;s normal family life. As an unschooling parent though you are likely to know the triggers, &amp; intervene before things get crazy. It&#39;s up to you to set up spaces &amp; resources that allow siblings to play/create/watch/rest/be noisy/have quiet time etc more harmoniously. It&#39;s not always easy balancing the needs of more than a couple of kids (&amp; i think this could be a topic itself) but the upside of all your effort (aside from creating peace) is when you see something like a child singing for the baby, or your older child steps in with a fun toy when your 3 year old is throwing a tantrum. Little things like that help you to see the life learning that happens every day from a family of all ages being together. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">------<br>\nHope this hasn&#39;t missed the mark entirely. :-) </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Niki <br><br><br><br><br><br></p>\n<div class=\"ygrps-yiv-2092429645gmail_extra\"><br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-2092429645gmail_quote\">On 20 Aug 2016 10:02 AM, &quot;Jo Isaac <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joanneisaac@...\">joanneisaac@...</a> [AlwaysLearning]&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups. com</a>&gt; wrote:<br><blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-2092429645gmail_quote\" style=\"margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;\">\n\n\n<u></u>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n<div style=\"background-color:#fff;\">\n<span> </span>\n\n\n<div>\n  <div>\n\n\n    <div>\n      \n      \n      <p>\n\n\n<div style=\"font-size:12pt;color:#000000;background-color:#ffffff;font-family:Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(33,33,33);font-family:Georgia;font-size:15px;\">=-Any stories or memories of things that helped you, but that were not at all on the horizon when you were a new unschooler?-=-</span><br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<div>Being friends with people with slightly older children, especially in real life.

What came to mind for me under the idea of “advanced topics” is that next level of challenge when","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-306309523\">I have two always unschooled kids, a 13 and 11 year old.&nbsp; What came to mind for me under the idea of “advanced topics” is that next level of challenge when you realize that unschooling is not a way to raise kids if you want them to be...obedient.&nbsp; If you like the idea of being In Charge, and the Head of Household, forget it.&nbsp; Be ready to be challenged, to explain your reasons, to be transparent about your thinking on all kinds of issues.&nbsp; They won’t always agree with your take on things…because you’ve trained to think for themselves&nbsp; AND THEY DO.&nbsp; It’s much more of a partnership than I expected (which is delightful, although sometimes inconvenient, haha).&nbsp; They bring real value toward solving problems.&nbsp; They certainly don’t want problems “solved” for them (quotes are because parents often go about “solving” problems they perceive in their kids by limiting, punishing, structuring, etc,).&nbsp; And they want to define what the problems are for themselves, too.<br>&nbsp; <br>What I’m saying is that my kids have turned out to be super independent, clear-headed people who respect logic and critical thinking but have no time for top-down rules or emotional demands.&nbsp; If I want them to do something, they will listen to my reasons, evaluate them against their own concerns, and often make a counter offer.&nbsp; It’s reasonable and friendly, but they are completely used to being taken seriously at this point and to not having their time wasted.&nbsp; Were I to announce, “Now we will do this because I say so.” …well, I’m just going to get an eye-roll and a joke unless it’s an obvious emergency.&nbsp; (Daughter, reading this, just said, “Well, if you felt really strongly about something, there’s probably a good reason. I’d go along with that!”&nbsp; WHEW.)&nbsp; <br><br>It goes both ways, too, which is nice. They offer me bulletpoint lists of convincing reasons when they want something I&#39;m not sure about.&nbsp; But if you want to be the Big Voice of Authority, and have less discussion, I think beating one’s kids and time-outs might work better.&nbsp; Unschooling, in my experience, creates people who are good at seeing through bullshit and who don’t put up with bullying.&nbsp; (Huh, never noticed both of those are bull-based words. Poor bulls, they have bad PR.)<br><br>For example, my then-12 year old girl wanted to go hang out with some new and old friends and I was a little uncomfortable.&nbsp; I wanted to say No.&nbsp; I had to think about why.&nbsp; Three things: one of the kids was new to homeschooling and had that adversarial-to-adults rebellion thing going on and I didn’t trust her to make good decisions. Plus these friends were older (13-15 years old).&nbsp; And finally I wanted to know what my girl (who looked older than she was) would do if she felt uncomfortable or got hit on or got ditched, because none of those sorts of things had ever come up before for her.&nbsp; When she heard my concerns she nodded, agreeing about the angry-ish kid, and we talked about strategies, with the clear intent between us at that point that we were trying to put me at ease so that hopefully I could say yes…unless it became apparent that it really wasn’t a good idea for her to go. Turns out she *had* thought of some of my concerns already (which helped me feel better), and *hadn’t* thought of others (which helped her trust my perspective a bit).&nbsp; I also copped to some irrational fears (my baby is growing up! Plus generalized ideas about what age is okay for what behavior, vs looking at This Person here in front of me, and what she, specifically, was capable of) that I had to let go of.&nbsp; After twenty minutes of chatting, we had it pretty well worked out.&nbsp; We also gave her my phone (and later got her her own phone).&nbsp; It ended with us both respecting the other one a little more, I think.&nbsp; Win win.<br><br>My point is, she wasn’t going to just accept a No without explanation. And if my reasons had been silly or unfounded—and if I hadn’t listened to her competence—we would have ended up in a worse place.&nbsp; It occurs to me now, typing this, that the part of her that won’t accept demands from me is the same strong-willed, self-assuredness in her that won’t accept crap from anyone, which is a big part of why I was able to feel good about her going out with those friends. <br><br>Advanced topic: top-down parenting is not an option in our house any more.&nbsp; At this age, these guys are beyond that. (Daughter, reading this, laughed, and I harumphed and said, “The beatings will now begin!” and she said, “You’ve had me in martial arts since I was five. Trying to beat me now would be a mistake.” HA! She is so right.) In case this sounds like my kids run all over me, they don’t.&nbsp; We just solve situations together.&nbsp; I think they respect me for being smart (sometimes? I hope?) and for having good ideas that are useful or interesting to their lives, not because I’m older or The Mom.&nbsp; And I get feedback from other adults that they are polite, well-mannered, a pleasure to have over.&nbsp; I quite agree!&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>SO what helped me with this...this <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">wanton defiance of my rightful place of power</span> :) was seeing them become people I respect, people that think for themselves, that question everything.&nbsp; Who still do things just because I ask sometimes, just to be nice to me.&nbsp; In other words, I&#39;m getting what I wanted! Strong-willed smarties!&nbsp; Who don&#39;t obey, dammit! :)<br><br>As they get older, if you&#39;re doing unschooling right, you will not be able to tell them what to do.&nbsp; That method just won’t work.&nbsp; This can be terrifying to some parents, I think.&nbsp; Everything you say will be fundamentally optional to to your unschooled kids.&nbsp; But it’s okay because partnership works better than obedience anyway. <br><br>Maya<br>(sorry this turned out so long!!)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":262895925,"authorName":"Sam","from":"Sam &lt;rainmountain1@...&gt;","profile":"rainmountain1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Advanced topics","postDate":"1471660073","msgId":77393,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ3M0RBMDNFLTUxN0QtNDJCQS1BMDZDLTk2Qjk1NkVEMEIyQkB5YWhvby5jby51az4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBQjBQN2hybXkxRjc9WnducytjcGY1MWYxSE5aWDMwYllLdEpBcGhLMF95aGszcDFkUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBQjBQN2hybXkxRjc9WnducytjcGY1MWYxSE5aWDMwYllLdEpBcGhLMF95aGszcDFkUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":77392,"nextInTopic":77394,"prevInTime":77392,"nextInTime":77394,"topicId":77376,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

They have the time and the space to be themselves, they have a calm knowing I never had that young. At first  I trusted old- timers on what they said, but also, I could see the children I remembered before school returning and that made me more determined to work harder at this. Now we just are. We flow. We work through things and thrive. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do think that spending time and energy with your kids is a priceless component here, though. Real relationships and conversations, real commitment to  their interests and needs  cannot be skipped or passed over and yield the same results. No shortcuts there. That&#39;s my incoherent response after a day swimming.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don’t want to be the only response to the topic!  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-Any stories or memories of things that helped you, but that were not at all on the horizon when you were a new unschooler?-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Seriously.

We all continue to grow and flourish in our own ways.

I will look through the pages on growth and “getting it” to see if there are things not already in my notes, but I’m sure a few things could be added by some of you here!  Help me, please! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe standard beginners’ questions are already listed here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/faq.html\">http://sandradodd.com/faq.html</a><br/>\nThat’s what I do NOT plan to talk about.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny stories or memories of things that helped you, but that were not at all on the horizon when you were a new unschooler?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77397,"nextTopicId":77409}}
