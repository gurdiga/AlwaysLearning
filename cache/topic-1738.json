We listen to classical, we draw, color, play games...of course they have plenty of time to play, but my 6 yog is often found of her own volition copying, writing numbers, we are finishing Peter Pan (the real one) and about to start the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe...I mean truly the children are constantly engaged in something.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  My PS teacher husband asked my daughter one day what I had taught her and  she said &quot;I teach myself&quot; and we had a long discussion on motivation and he had to agree that the optimal position to &quot;teach&quot; from was more as a guide to someone who is motivated.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  As far as what curriculum you can say you are eclectic, or we use the public library.  I personally feel that the term &quot;unschooling&quot; is kinda imflammatory and people just have no concept and jump to the worst conclusions.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  That said I had a big discussion with my sil tonite on hsing and she is thrilled with her ps and it sounds like they have a good one from what she said but a few of the thoughts I left her with *we just want something different* and *we don&#39;t really need government testing because I already know how she&#39;s doing*  and as a response to her complaint that her 13 yos is getting disrespectful I told her that it sounded like he needed some private time with her and she said she just couldn&#39;t cause there is no time and I told her that that is one of our luxuries *time*<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Fortunately I had my sis there who used to hs, doesn&#39;t anymore (Don&#39;t know why) but she totally backed me up that the ps kids are bullies and really rotten to anyone who is not up to snuff academically.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I have been learning about Thomas Jefferson Education and I&#39;m totally turned on by it to be honest.  They have a lot of fantastic ideas that are totally unschoolish, and yet I am learning how I can inspire my kids to learn...one of their foundation ideas is *inspire, not require*  and also that the leaders of tomorrow are going to have a hard time developing into leaders if they are constantly being directed to do this and that.  Like I said...I am totally jazzed.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  So that&#39;s my story and I&#39;m stickin&#39; to it.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Dora<br/>\n   <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nChristy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:christy-aitken@...\">christy-aitken@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  Welcome, Melissa.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy little sister lives in OK City.

Hmmm.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, my name is Melissa, I live in Oklahoma. I&#39;m married to a networking<br/>\ntech named <br/>\nZane, we have seven kids. Josh is age 10, Breanna is 8, Emily is almost 7,<br/>\nRachel is 5, Sam <br/>\nis four, Dan is two, and Avari is four weeks old today. I&#39;ve posted before<br/>\nabout my 8yo, <br/>\nwho has severe autism. Josh also has autism in the form of Aspergers. Sam<br/>\nhas dysarthria, <br/>\ncharacterized mostly by his speech deficits. On top of that, Bre is allergic<br/>\nto all cornbased <br/>\nproducts and Dan is allergic to wheat.<br/>\n<br/>\nLong story short was I had always planned on homeschooling the kids, but<br/>\nwhen Bre was <br/>\ndiagnosed at age three I was convinced that the school system would know<br/>\nwhat was best <br/>\nfor her. That was the same year that Josh was to start kindergarden, and dh<br/>\nwas deadset <br/>\nagainst homeschooling. After three years, public school became a struggle.<br/>\nEmily and <br/>\nRachel started school, Emily in kindergarden, Rachel in PreK, Josh was dxed,<br/>\nand Breanna <br/>\nleft the comfort of the developmentally delayed program. By last Christmas I<br/>\nwas ready to <br/>\npull my poor, stressed out children OUT of school.  We left them in til the<br/>\nend of the year. <br/>\nBre&#39;s psych is generally against homeschooling for someone as severe as she<br/>\nis, but finally <br/>\nagreed it was that or medicating her. What a fool I was for thinking the<br/>\nschools are trained <br/>\nfor this. In some places maybe, but not here. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy plan was to just spend a year getting to know my kids, and practice being<br/>\na family. Bre <br/>\nneeds a schedule, so it was easy to kind of follow the preschool schedule<br/>\nthat Emily and <br/>\nRachel were used to from preschool and kindergarden. It worked until I was<br/>\nput on <br/>\nbedrest. Actually we had a lot of fun, and we had fun on bedrest too. It was<br/>\nprobably the <br/>\nbest thing that happened, lots of times the kids would bring books to me, we<br/>\ndid a lot of <br/>\njust growing from one topic to the next, depending on their interests. Josh<br/>\nand Emily love <br/>\nto sit and work on math, so they are the kind to ask for math equations.<br/>\nRachel loves to <br/>\ndraw, and actually learned to read from art books. Breanna is very<br/>\nkinesthetic, learns by <br/>\ndoing. Sam is very active. The school last year kept asking him how excited<br/>\nhe was to <br/>\nstarte preschool this year, and I thought even if we were going to keep them<br/>\nhome, there <br/>\nwas NO way I would send Sam to preK, they would break his spirit in no time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I would like to unschool.

While in college I had a placement","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-5135111\">Hello everyone!!<br/>\n <br/>\nMy name is Kerri & my family lives in Ontario on 3 acres of forest in a house we started to build in 1998. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile in college I had a placement & then did research working with language delayed & not language delayed pre-schoolers who were primarily in day-cares. That is when I decided I would NEVER put my child/ren in day-care. Then I was at a placement in the primary school system & decided I could not put my kids into primary school either. <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally school was not a very good experience for me. We moved a lot when I was a kid (my dad was a bank manager). I almost always ended up starting at a new school at the end of October. My marks were always good despite all this. However I was very tiny for my age, was placed a year ahead (started senior kindergarten when I was 4) and I wore glasses. So...I was teased A LOT.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I got to high-school I was still very tiny, still wore glasses & had moved from the city to a very small town so was an out-cast because I was a &quot;city-slicker&quot;. Though I did surprise them with my &quot;country&quot; knowledge as I had always wanted to live in the country & had volunteered at a country animal-shelter and with twin veterinarians who did large & small animals when I did live in the last city. For some odd reason they all thought I was super-smart. Ha, far from it!! So I was shunned into the &quot;smart&quot; group, which was also apparently the &quot;kids of professionals&quot; group. They wouldn&#39;t accept me either because I wasn&#39;t snobby enough!! So I had the odd friend here & there & was never in a group. I was however, still teased a lot. I was stuffed into my locker (not locked in at least), the football players would scoop me up onto their shoulders, carry me half way through the school & make me late for class. Plus the verbal teasing wasn&#39;t pleasant either. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I would be content for my kids to not go to high-school either.  We belong to a provincial home-schooling organization right now. <br/>\n<br/>\nI had to really convince DH that our kids would be fine learning at home. His brother is a teacher & his new wife is too. They were against our choice to home-school as were both sets of our parents. My MIL even told my oldest DD if she didn&#39;t go to school she would end up being stupid. Funny thing is BIL&#39;s DD was home-schooled by his ex-wife & his DD went on to a 3 year college program in computers.In the meantime, his DS (living with my BIL) was unable to read when he was in grade 9. BIL had no idea till the school told him!So I figured he better stop nagging us about the merits of &quot;public&quot; education!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI essentially unschool. Have tried the &quot;forced&quot; book work stuff when DH was bugging me to do it. Kids & I never lasted long ( a few days ). It was often after visiting with his parents!! <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter my twins were born the 4 older kids were totally unschooling!! It really is amazing to see how much they do learn just from living life. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids have recently asked if we could do learning stuff in the mornings. So we do, but their choice of what to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy issue right now is my 13 year old DD really wanting to go to high-school. She admits it is for social reasons, not to learn. So I am trying to give her alternative ideas, other than going to a &quot;brick & mortar institution&quot;. My DH had a wonderful high-school experience & seems oblivious to the abuse, drugs, attitudes, teasing, etc. that occured. We went to the same high-school, but he is 2 years older. I must say, that he was one of the popular kids who teased the other kids. We met after we were both done school & he was very different when not with his previous peer group.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that if he was married to someone that was very mainstream. That he would also be mainstream. He has agreed with my choices for our family, because that is what I think is best. But though he agrees, it isn&#39;t in his heart, they way it is in mine. <br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this ended up being a novel didn&#39;t it!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am looking forward to getting support here for my choice of unschooling my children.

I would like to know more, so I am here to<br/>\nlearn....<br/>\nBlessings<br/>\nCathy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, December 28, 2001 2:37 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Digest Number 78<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 12/27/01 2:48:58 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wordup@...\">wordup@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; I&#39;ve never seen the unschooling.com list -- in fact, I&#39;m new to this<br/>\nlist<br/>\n&gt; as well.
