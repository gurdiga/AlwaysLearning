sound.  Then the child can go pick<br/>\ntreat out of a box.  Megan always finds the monkey, but doesn&#39;t always<br/>\nwant the treat.  She just likes to find the monkey.<br/>\n<br/>\n* If a display is disordered or packages that are supposed to be hanging aren&#39;t, both Megan and Zoe will stop and straighten it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love shopping with my kids.  We have fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGwen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":137349367,"authorName":"cathyandgarth","from":"&quot;cathyandgarth&quot;

We were at our local corner market, picking out donuts, and the deli guy came over with some cheese slices for the kids.  There was another little boy standing there as well, about Zach&#39;s age (3) at the time, and the deli guy offered him some cheese too.  My kids were thrilled and the other little boy was excitedly reaching for his peice of cheese when his father stopped him, &quot;no, you can&#39;t have that, you are having a donut!&quot;  The boy looked heart-broken.  (I thought about dairy allergies, but there is milk in donuts, and the father didn&#39;t say, no, you are allergic or anything like that.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI wondered if the father ever thought about or realized later on how his Automatic No stopped his son from having a good slice of cheese in favor of a donut?
