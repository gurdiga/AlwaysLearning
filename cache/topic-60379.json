It is not an admission of any wrongdoing.<br/>\n<br/>\nDina explained: &quot;Obviously she&#39;s not pleading guilty. My children don&#39;t steal things.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n==========================<br/>\n<br/>\nI had already set up a post at Just Add Light and Stir, to be mailed automatically tomorrow, because Holly and I are going to Chicago tomorrow, for the InHome Conference in Illinois.   The quote I put up before I found the article above is:  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If your child is more important than your vision of your child, life becomes easier.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA mother saying &quot;My children don&#39;t steal things&quot; isn&#39;t very helpful if one of the children has been caught stealing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf a mom says &quot;We believe...&quot; or &quot;We love...&quot; something, speaking for her entire family, how free will her children feel to choose otherwise?  And if the mother holds her statement of belief in such high regard that she won&#39;t even look at what her children actually do believe or love, she is not seeing her children directly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t apply to a three year old boy.  It&#39;s about why it would ever be a problem for one person to speak for a family and to defend that position &quot;la la la la&quot; without considering that children grow older and might not WANT their mother speaking for them.  Or that one person can&#39;t be positive that her hoped-for family belief might not be shared by her husband or by each of her children.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/expectations\">http://sandradodd.com/expectations</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/words/without\">http://sandradodd.com/words/without</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/being/\">http://sandradodd.com/being/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60375,"nextTopicId":60377}}
