I hate it, and I don&#39;t get at all how he could enjoy it!  It would be painful for me to be in front of all of those people.  I was prepared to back out of any tournament at the last minute, even if we had paid.  Richard has never wanted to though.  He has been competing both locally and nationally since he was 7.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been to HUGE national tournaments.  I don&#39;t know how big the one that you are going to is, but I have been to ones with thousands of competitors.  They can be overwhelming.  My advise is take snacks in your bag, lots of high protein snacks.  The national ones that we have been to had very expensive snack bars with long lines.   <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, be calm, if you are calm, then you can be a center for her in all of the chaos.  Take time passing things for her, gameboy, psp, cards, drawing paper, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAt first I worried that I would miss the call for Richard&#39;s group, because they are big and loud, but all of the ones that we have been to have been really good about making multiple announcements.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI would let her know that she can back out.  I understand that you feel like she is obligated since she said she would do it, but it is not like she is an instructor leading part of the competition.  So what if she backs out?  But at the same time I would also encourage her if she really does want to do it.  Let her know that if she does it and doesn&#39;t like it she doesn&#39;t have to do another.  She may love it though.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the big competitions break the groups up so that there are only 6-12 in a ring.  Maybe yours will be different, but I doubt it.  Ours usually have many many rings.  Once you get to your ring, you really don&#39;t see all of those people.  You may have mentioned this, but has she been to local tournaments?  If so point out to her that once you get to your ring it really isn&#39;t much different.  Or point out the similarity to local testing, or even class.  Something she is comfortable with.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI got frustrated when I paid too much attention to the scores, I thought my boy should be scored higher of course!  It was all internal, I didn&#39;t express my frustration at all.  But when I loosened up and just enjoyed watching him and enjoying his happiness it was a lot better for me.  Him too, probably, though he never seemed to notice.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that she has a good time, whether she competes, just watches, or stays home.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKaty<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185586397,"authorName":"Lyla Wolfenstein","from":"&quot;Lyla Wolfenstein&quot; &lt;lylaw@...&gt;","profile":"lylawolf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] sports competition","postDate":"1235027323","msgId":42092,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJCNEQyODRFRjkwRDQ3MDU5ODlFRTg2QzIxNUM4MzEzQExZTEFMQVAyPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDM5MjQ0Ni4yNTk4OC5xbUB3ZWI1MDQwMy5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDM5MjQ0Ni4yNTk4OC5xbUB3ZWI1MDQwMy5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":42091,"nextInTopic":42093,"prevInTime":42091,"nextInTime":42093,"topicId":42083,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"i didn t mean to be all doom and gloom.  just wanted you to be prepared for the possibility that it would take most of the day. i am sure you can still make it","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-73620871\">i didn&#39;t mean to be all doom and gloom.  just wanted you to be prepared for the possibility that it would take most of the day. i am sure you can still make it a fun experience for your daughter, with good support and a joyful attitude!  is it in gresham?<br/>\n<br/>\nlyla<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":12252351,"authorName":"Gwen","from":"Gwen &lt;willow_selene@...&gt;","profile":"willow_selene","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] sports competition","postDate":"1235027129","msgId":42091,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5MjQ0Ni4yNTk4OC5xbUB3ZWI1MDQwMy5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDgyMDE0NjFCQzdDNDQwM0M5Njg1RjdDMjhDQjEwNzc2QExZTEFMQVAyPg=="},"prevInTopic":42090,"nextInTopic":42092,"prevInTime":42090,"nextInTime":42092,"topicId":42083,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"ok, so far I am not seeing any fun happening!

She<br/>\n&gt; likes the classes and really likes her instructor.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   The instructor doesn&#39;t schedule much time between<br/>\n&gt; classes, so one on one time to talk to him is limited (which<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t to say he isn&#39;t accessible, just busy). He<br/>\n&gt; leaves important notes on a whiteboard. Things like when the<br/>\n&gt; next testing date will be, when the Christmas party is, and<br/>\n&gt; other things everyone needs to know. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Last week, there was a note on the board that said every<br/>\n&gt; student must participate in an upcoming tournament. Megan<br/>\n&gt; said she didn&#39;t want to compete. My husband went in,<br/>\n&gt; with Megan, before one of Megan&#39;s classes to talk to her<br/>\n&gt; teacher and explain that Megan was not interested in<br/>\n&gt; competing. Her teacher said something (to Megan) like<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Are you sure? There will be forms and board breaking<br/>\n&gt; and sparring. You don&#39;t want to do any of that?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Megan decided she wanted to try sparring. My husband asked<br/>\n&gt; if she was sure and Megan said she was. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Here are my concerns:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   1) her teacher is very charismatic and I am a little<br/>\n&gt; concerned that his enthusiasm rubbed off on Megan and she<br/>\n&gt; agreed to something that maybe she wasn&#39;t behind 100%. I<br/>\n&gt; probably would have chosen to talk to her teacher without<br/>\n&gt; Megan in the room, but it didn&#39;t happen that way.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   2) Megan only spars with full gear on once a week and the<br/>\n&gt; other two classes are no contact sparring mixed with forms<br/>\n&gt; and other things. The teacher lets the kids choose their own<br/>\n&gt; partners about 50% of the time. Megan usually pairs with her<br/>\n&gt; cousin who is a year younger (my niece usually chooses Megan<br/>\n&gt; before Megan can choose someone else). My niece has no<br/>\n&gt; enthusiasm or interest in the class (she usually cries<br/>\n&gt; through most of the class, it is awful and I feel horribly<br/>\n&gt; for her, but my brother won&#39;t take her out of the class<br/>\n&gt; because it is &quot;good for her&quot;). So when Megan and<br/>\n&gt; my niece spar, Megan is sparring with someone who runs away<br/>\n&gt; or tries to tackle/tickly her and doesn&#39;t hit back. When<br/>\n&gt; Megan spars with other kids she gets a gleam in her eye and<br/>\n&gt; has a great time. There is only session for sparring per<br/>\n&gt; week. My niece lives with us from Friday night to Sunday<br/>\n&gt; night and most holidays. So they do see each other<br/>\n&gt; frequently. Anyway, my concern is that Megan<br/>\n&gt;   won&#39;t do as well as she would like to do in the<br/>\n&gt; tournament. Megan takes Taekwondo for fun. I never expected<br/>\n&gt; her to want to compete.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   3) My niece will also be competing in the tournament. You<br/>\n&gt; know those parents who coach their kids from the sidelines<br/>\n&gt; in the most ungentle way possible? That&#39;s my brother. He<br/>\n&gt; will be taking her to the tournament and then dropping her<br/>\n&gt; off at our house. So whatever happens at the tournament will<br/>\n&gt; be ours to deal with for the rest of the weekend. I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; guessing he won&#39;t actually talk to her while she is on<br/>\n&gt; the mat (is that the right word?), but I&#39;m sure he will<br/>\n&gt; be doing it before and after.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   4) Megan is very enthusiastic about the tournament. Megan<br/>\n&gt; has been known to change her mind in the past and we&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; accommodated that as much as possible. But now that<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;ve paid an entry fee and she will be scheduled to<br/>\n&gt; compete...I&#39;m feeling as if her option to back out<br/>\n&gt; closed when mailed the entry fee (not because of the<br/>\n&gt; fee...although $60 is a lot of money right now...more<br/>\n&gt; because by entering and paying the fee we&#39;ve made a<br/>\n&gt; commitment to be there - at her request). But I also realize<br/>\n&gt; she&#39;s seven and that is too to put on her, so other than<br/>\n&gt; asking &quot;are you sure?&quot; and saying &quot;this means<br/>\n&gt; you need to go because you are scheduled to be there&quot;<br/>\n&gt; she isn&#39;t getting baggage from me about it. I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; love that phrasing, so if there is a better way I can state<br/>\n&gt; it, I&#39;m open to suggestions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   5) I&#39;ve never been to one of these tournaments<br/>\n&gt; before, so I&#39;m not sure what to expect. I&#39;d like to<br/>\n&gt; prepare Megan a little bit. Has anyone&#39;s kids<br/>\n&gt; participated in something like this at younger ages?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   6) Ok, so after the tournament...any suggestions on how I<br/>\n&gt; can support Megan and my niece? They are very likely going<br/>\n&gt; to have very different experiences.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;   Gwen<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
