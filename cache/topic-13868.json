Clever thinking and then I told them to wait for the answering <br/>\nmachine to pick up any calls and only pick up if they heard my voice. To <br/>\nthat, they were thrilled and shoed me right out the door.<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13867,"nextTopicId":13874}}
