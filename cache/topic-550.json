When I was very young, our next door<br/>\nneighbor was a psych major.  As part of a project, he tested me, my sister<br/>\nand brother, and my mom and dad.  My mom would never say *exactly* what our<br/>\nscores were, just that dad was lowest and she and the kids were all above<br/>\n145.  She liked that.  (Dad was soon out of the picture, btw.)  I lived in<br/>\nthe shadow of that number all my life; I got the &quot;she&#39;s not working up to<br/>\nher potential&quot; comment on my report cards.  I never understood why school<br/>\nwasn&#39;t easy for me if I was so smart.<br/>\n<br/>\nI took an online IQ test the other day (the Internet is a *dangerous*<br/>\nthing!).  My score was 113.
