It is not that I started off with formulating some sort of <br/>\nroutine, it just kind of evolved.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEach night, we all go get on our comfy p.js.  I put in a &quot;night-<br/>\nnight&quot; video for dc (something calming at their request and only <br/>\nabout 30 min. long) and prepare them a &quot;night-night&quot; snack to eat <br/>\nduring the video -- something simple like apples and peanut butter or <br/>\nbanana slices and carrot sticks - you get the picture.  While they <br/>\nare watching the video, I get their room ready - turn back the <br/>\nblankets a bit, warm up the rice bags in the microwave (they&#39;ve had <br/>\nthose since they were babies for upset tummies! now they like them on <br/>\ntheir toes!) and place them under their blankets, get all <br/>\ntheir &quot;friends&quot; together (special stuffed animals, blankies), turn on <br/>\nthe crickets (noise machine), dim the light.  After the video, we all <br/>\n(me included) brush teeth, they climb in under the warmed up blankets <br/>\nand I read to them.  Then it&#39;s lots of kisses and hugs.  I then turn <br/>\non their classical music cd, turn off the light and turn on the night <br/>\nlight, sit between them and rub and pat their backs until they fall <br/>\nasleep.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is all so calming and at the end of a busy day, they both really <br/>\nlook forward to bedtime.  After writing all this, I realize that I <br/>\ncan not replicate this scenerio when we are away from home.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, when we visited their cousin, I tried to have things as <br/>\nmuch like what they have at home, but out of respect for the cousin, <br/>\nwe followed HIS routine, which looks very different from ours.  The <br/>\nmusic is different, the night light is a lot brighter, there is no <br/>\nstory time (although I did read anyway but my nephew really didn&#39;t <br/>\nwant it because that is not part of his routine), dc were sleeping on <br/>\nthe floor (even though I brought their blankets and &quot;friends&quot; and <br/>\npillows, the floor just feels so different than their own bed).  I <br/>\nstill sat between them and patted their backs, but they still missed <br/>\nhome.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we went camping, the entire night time routine was gone.  We <br/>\nlisted to real crickets (imagine that!), the stars were our night <br/>\nlights, and we read stories by the fire.  But after we got in the <br/>\ntent, they began crying wanting to be home.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; How have you responded?

I am sure I <br/>\nprobably did try to talk them out of their feelings.  That is one <br/>\nthing I will do differently.  Even at the time, it seemed wrong to <br/>\ntry to help them &quot;get over&quot; it instead of helping them acknowledge <br/>\nthe feelings and to allow them to &quot;feel&quot;.

They seem to be <br/>\nhaving so much fun with cousins, but they are used to being with me <br/>\nmost of the time.  Maybe when all is still and it is time to sleep, <br/>\nthey really do feel a little abandoned, even though they were having <br/>\na good time with cousins.

Maybe a little feeling of abandonment to their own devices while you&#39;re with your family?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI had something kind of like this happen just this week.  The background is that my step-father passed away and we had a lot of family in the area.  We were spending a couple of nights up at his old mountain house in Ruidoso (about 45 minutes away), and while getting ready to go I asked Richard to do a few things, it seemed like everything I asked him to do got lost in translation.  He kept forgetting what I said, or doing the opposite, and once while I was letting the dog out he accidentally locked me out of my mom&#39;s house.  I was getting really frustrated.  We were in a hurry, so in my frustration I really didn&#39;t want to stop loading the car and talk to him calmly, but I did and I am so glad.  I apologized for blowing up, and we talked about how things like grief and anger and stress and hunger and tiredness and everything else affect each of us differently,  and I told him that with me, though I have gotten much better in the last few years, any one of those things can cause me to be short tempered, but all of them together make it really bad!   <br/>\n<br/>\nPart of my frustration I think came from what I am used to from my son.  He usually seems much older than his 12 years, he is dependable and responsible, more so than many adults that I know.  So when he was having a hard time, and I was super stressed, I forgot how to deal with it.  He had lost his grandpa, he was very tired, I had fed him but since people were bringing food to us it wasn&#39;t what he was used to, I was rushing him, and over the last few days I hadn&#39;t spent nearly as much time with him as he is used to.  It is a wonder he did as well as he did!  In fact he was still doing pretty great, I was the one with the issues!  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo while we were in Ruidoso, there were so many people around, and everyone wanted to talk and I really didn&#39;t want him to get pushed to the side again.  I made sure to go and find him fairly often and hug him, bring him food or drinks, make sure he had enough to do (we brought favorite video games and movies, as well as toys), talk to him for a while privately or bring him around with me to talk to people, whatever he needed.  It really made a difference, for both of us.  I told myself that I was trying to take care of him, but really going and spending some time with him between people really lowered my stress level, which meant I was better with him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI found that most people really understand if you excuse yourself to check on kids or spend some time with them, and if they don&#39;t, so what?!  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing that helped were those little familiar things from home.  I take his pillow and favorite blanket on trips right off of the bed without washing them, so they smell like home.  His favorite stuffed animals are important, I always make sure to take one or two.  We have a portable DVD player, and we always bring his favorite movies, and often I will hit the $5 bin at Walmart and grab one or two new movies to surprise him with on trips.  He is really into the movie &quot;300,&quot; so I got him the History Channel&#39;s show on DVD about the real battle that the movie is based on, and recently I found another older movie about the same battle and I had been hanging onto it, so we took it up there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTime with me and the little familiar things from home seem to be the best things for my son when away from home or during stressful times.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKaty J<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] home sickness","postDate":"1203789336","msgId":32247,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIxM0FBQzc2LTFCMDMtNDAxQS1CODRBLUIwRDYzQkZBNTREM0BtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZwcGRkdCtuYmZsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZwcGRkdCtuYmZsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":32246,"nextInTopic":32258,"prevInTime":32246,"nextInTime":32248,"topicId":32246,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I mainly lurk on this site, but have an upcoming <br/>\nsituation that I need advice on.  I am fairly new to unschooling <br/>\n(since this past fall) and have been reading everything I can about <br/>\nunschooling (books, websites, discussion groups, etc.).  So your <br/>\nadvice would be very helpful here.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy ds(5) and dd(8) have never been in any kind of school.  We have <br/>\nalways done things together as a family.  My children enjoy being at <br/>\nhome where everything is familiar.  When we went on vacation last <br/>\nfall (when I had first &quot;discovered&quot; the concept of unschooling) ds <br/>\nand dd had fun until the first night (we were camping and they were <br/>\nhaving so much fun).  They missed their bed and all their familiar <br/>\nthings and smells of home.  By the second night, dd and ds were <br/>\ncrying, wanting to go home.  Also dd ended up being sick with a sore <br/>\nthroat and a fever, so we went home the next day.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt Thanksgiving, we went to my parents&#39; house which is only about 50 <br/>\nminutes away.  We spent the night on Wed. night so that we would have <br/>\nmore time to spend with family (I have 11 brothers and sisters, most <br/>\nof them married with kids!).  Both kids were sad at night and wanted <br/>\nto be home.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, this past December, the kids and I went to visit my sil and her <br/>\ntwo children.  They live only an hour away.  We spent the night so <br/>\nthat we could get up in the morning and do some fun Christmas stuff.  <br/>\nThat night, both kids cried and said they wanted to be home in their <br/>\nown beds and they missed their daddy. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow here is the problem.  My niece who lives about 7 hours away is <br/>\ngetting married.  Dd has been asked to be a flower girl and she is so <br/>\nexcited.  I&#39;ve been talking a bit about it and ds is getting <br/>\nanxious.  Dd is excited right now, but I know once we get there and <br/>\nnight time comes around, she will get homesick.  We had planned for <br/>\nmy dh to take vacation time that week and then we could plan to do <br/>\nsome other fun stuff as well (we will be heading to southern part of <br/>\nMississippi).  The wedding is not until June.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I am asking for help in how to deal with this situation.  I <br/>\nwant to know how I can help them feel safe and also experience places <br/>\nother than home.  I know they will have fun doing all the &quot;stuff&quot; but <br/>\nit is night time that gets hard.  How do others deal with <br/>\nhomesickness?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nMelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32254,"nextTopicId":32277}}
