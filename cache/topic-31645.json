I am passing on what a friend of mine wrote to the editor:<br/>\n<br/>\nEditor,<br/>\n<br/>\nYour article, &quot;Huckabee Draws Support of Home-School Families,&quot; said that conservative <br/>\nChristians are &#147;the vast majority&#148; of the homeschoolers, which is inaccurate. A 2003 U.S. <br/>\nCensus survey reported that only 33% of homeschooling households cited religion as a factor <br/>\nin why they homeschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is possible that homeschooling liberals and moderates may swing the political tide.  <br/>\nAccording a 2001 survey by the The Barna Group, the majority of American homeschoolers <br/>\nare non-white.  And don&#39;t forget that many evangelicals may be led by their conscience to <br/>\nvote for a Democrat based on his or her record on the environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe statement, &quot;As a group, [homeschoolers] are &#133; in a constant struggle with public <br/>\nauthorities&quot; is misguided.  Homeschooling removes the child from the local authority&#39;s <br/>\njurisdiction, so mostly any &quot;struggle&quot; with outside parties is resolved.  There are ample legal <br/>\nprotections for homeschoolers in most states.  Colleges now welcome applications from <br/>\nwell-educated homeschoolers.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31644,"nextTopicId":31650}}
