I truly feel that this is because of the limitations my own parents put me on as a child. We weren&#39;t allowed to have snacks or sweets in the house, so when I&#39;d go to a friend or a relative&#39;s home where these were allowed, I&#39;d overindulge on them - every time. I saved allowance and lunch money to buy candy and sodas after school. When I was old enough to get a job, all my money went to food that I wasn&#39;t allowed at home. When I grew up and moved out of the house my diet consisted of spaghetti-o&#39;s, totino&#39;s pizza, chips, cherry coke and Dr. Pepper. I did not eat real food at all. As a result, by the time I had my second child I was over 300 lbs with high blood pressure and a myriad of other health issues. By then, it was too late for me - I could not get the weight off on my own and I had gastric surgery last year. I now can LITERALLY not eat the things I did before because they make me really sick. I&#39;m forced into a diet of strictly meat and vegetables with some fruit here and there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI absolutely REFUSE for my children to go through what I went through. Therefore, chips, candy, soda, cookies and other things are allowed in my house as well as apples, carrots, grapes and yogurt. This &quot;food freedom&quot; in my home is something I decided on long before I even knew what unschooling was. My food issues are not my children&#39;s food issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally speaking, my kids have chips and soda and candy most days, but they also eat meat, cheese, fruit and veggies. Their diets are well-rounded and they are healthy children. They choose daily what they want to eat for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. Some days I cringe at their choices (this morning for my five year old it was chips and Oreo cookies for breakfast), but I also know that later on they will probably chose an apple and milk for a snack. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is this, when we freak out and get hyper over our children&#39;s food choices, there is a good possibility that they will have eating disorders or other issues later in life.

It hasn&#39;t gone far yet. <br/>\n&quot;If you don&#39;t recognize an ingredient, your body won&#39;t either.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n I went to look.  The earliest I found was a tweet or instagram or something, and was marked #inflammation (as in &quot;file this with other info about inflammation).   Someone made an image with the quote and &quot;~Inflammation&quot; in a smaller font to the right, as though the author of the quote was &quot;Inflammation.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s an interesting thought, and a propagandistic slogan probably created to sell something or to increase fear.   Lots of people responded &quot;how true&quot; and such, as though it were literally sensible and true.  But it&#39;s not.  Your body doesn&#39;t care what you know or recognize.  How long ago was yogurt unknown in much of western culture?  If someone doesn&#39;t know that acidophilus or kefir is, will their bodies reject them?  If people fifty years from now say &quot;Cannot BELIEVE people thought acidophilus was good for them,&quot; will that mean that people who used it in 1980 were idiots?  <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople live where they live.  They believe what they believe.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of people my age and older had their tonsils removed because doctors didn&#39;t know what they were good for, but they saw them become inflamed, and so blamed the tonsils for the infection.  Rather than figure out how to improve health for a person&#39;s appendix, doctors didn&#39;t know what they were for and so assumed they were vestigial and not good for anything.  Out went lots of them.  Gall bladders; similar.  That&#39;s in the U.S.  Other cultures, different parts of bodies are considered mysteriously unimportant, or dangerous, and are cut off.   <br/>\n<br/>\nBodies operate without people&#39;s will or knowledge.  Our hearts beat because they do.  Someone very smart and someone who can&#39;t speak or walk, both their hearts know how to beat.<br/>\n<br/>\nHumility is underrated in our culture.  People think they KNOW just because they kind of heard, or think they read, or the friend whose car and house they admire is doing it, or there&#39;s a whole magazine about it, and so it must be important.  Following groups is okay.  It&#39;s probably safer and more adaptive in many ways that going out alone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling isn&#39;t done in groups, though.  It&#39;s done by parents in their homes, with their individual children.

By the time unschooled kids are ready to leave home, their diets should show full blown addiction with convenience foods making up the bulk of their diet. But that doesn&#39;t happen. I would say as an adult my daughter definitely eats fewer commercial foods than when she was a kid. And when she was a kid she didn&#39;t eat that much. The appeal of convenience foods for kids is they&#39;re easy to grab, easy to eat, high in calories and carbohydrates. And the taste, texture, presentation is appealing.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the way it happened here, too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEach of my kids is careful and aware of food choices.   <br/>\n<br/>\nOn these road trips the two younger ones are one, food photos were posted.  Holly went to a sushi restaurant in Oakland and sent a photo of her food, and of her boyfriend with along sushi roll.   I don&#39;t like sushi; she didn&#39;t get that from me.   (Holly also sent a photo of one piece of pizza left on a pan, from another night.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty posted a photo of a steak and lobster dinner he or Ashlee (his girlfriend) was about to eat at a casino in Las Vegas.  Not everyone wants to eat steak or lobster.  I don&#39;t eat steak, and I don&#39;t eat lobster.  He didn&#39;t get that from me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last I knew, Kirby wasn&#39;t drinking soda.  Marty went a long time without it, but is drinking Dr Pepper again now sometimes.  Holly has a coke a time or two a week, but she&#39;s also big into farmers&#39; markets and loves lots of vegetables her dad won&#39;t eat.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause we hadn&#39;t demonized or villified any foods at all, their choices were as untainted as we could make them.  Sure, sometimes people express negativity.  I wish I never had.  A friend of theirs brought a jar of marshmallow creme over, which I had never owned, and I said gross, and it sat in the cabinet for a year until I threw it away.

That&#39;s the important thing, the thing that gets missed if you go into a full-on panic about toxic/addictive whatever foods and food ingredients. Children are busy people. They are busy learning and exploring - physically, mentally, spiritually. It feels good to learn and explore in all those ways. It feels good to be healthy. <br/>\n<br/>\nGiven the chance, given real options, kids eat pretty darned well. Sure, they&#39;ll eat some sweets, some pre-packed foods, but they don&#39;t gorge on those things. They eat when they&#39;re hungry and stop when they&#39;ve had enough. Given a variety of things, they&#39;ll try a variety of things and make choices based not only on immediate pleasure but on what feels good over time. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve never seen that, if you&#39;ve only ever seen the way people eat in response to teaching and resistance to teaching and all the guilt and shame and self-loathing which goes with that, it seems widely unlikely children could learn to eat what&#39;s good for them without being taught - but they do. It&#39;s not a guess, it&#39;s the common experience of radical unschooling families. Kids actually can tell what&#39;s good for their bodies over time and they care about that. You don&#39;t have to teach them. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf anything, teaching creates more problems, it Causes people to be oblivious to the real information of their bodies and feelings. Think of all the adults who struggle soooooo much with knowing what to eat and when and how - they didn&#39;t grow up with parents saying &quot;whatever&quot; - there has Yet to be a generation where that was the common parenting practice. All those people struggling with food and eating and eating disorders grew up being taught about food, about what they should and should not eat, and when, and how much. Eat your vegetables, or no dessert for you. How can you have any pudding if you don&#39;t eat your meat? That&#39;s Normal. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing about that sort of food control is that it Makes Sense in poverty. If you&#39;re poor enough, if food is scarce enough, you eat what there is. You absolutely bully your kids to eat what there is because there Are no better options and pure survival is more important than any kind of emotional well being. If you&#39;re poor enough, when there&#39;s plenty of Anything it makes good sense to gorge on it, because you won&#39;t be seeing that kind of abundance again soon. <br/>\n<br/>\nApplying those kinds of standards and expectations to a life in which food is relatively abundant doesn&#39;t work. It&#39;s a set-up for years of struggling with food. Happily, it Is Not Necessary. In an environment of abundance, of variety and choices, kids have the innate ability to experiment and discover what is good for them - Because good food supports health and vitality.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Food choice backed by research (and Google)","postDate":"1363527594","msgId":70960,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYxQzg0QzBDLTUzOEItNDc1RS05OEZCLTFBRjBBNzY2NUZFOUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGtpMmN2cCszMWx2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtpMmN2cCszMWx2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":70959,"nextInTopic":70961,"prevInTime":70959,"nextInTime":70961,"topicId":70935,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It&#39;s just going to make people want them more *not* because people want super sized drinks. But because people like to decide for themselves. If you put the calorie content on the menu, then people can decide *each time* &quot;Do I want 450 calories from my Coke this time?&quot; Maybe sometimes it will be yes! Sometimes, probably way less than it is now, the decision will be no.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what most people first *expect* from giving kids choice is kids learning quickly to make the &quot;right&quot; choice for all time. But the goal should be learning and listening to their own needs and making a choice that&#39;s right for *each time*. If a choice they make has upsides and down sides -- as most choices do -- it&#39;s information for the future. By exploring and discovering for themselves, each time someone can weigh the downsides of available choices and upsides against their needs in them moment and make better choices for that instance.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; there is still &quot;good food&quot; and &quot;not-so-good food.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are nutritionally more dense foods and nutritionally less dense foods. There are also foods that are more convenient and foods that are less convenient. And other factors.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen given choice, kids *won&#39;t* prioritize nutrition over other factors. That&#39;s important to realize in what we&#39;re saying! They will -- as all humans will -- *also* weigh convenience (that&#39;s a biggie for kids!), taste, texture, appearance, smell, personal preferences and other factors that aren&#39;t quantifiable. The food manufactures know this. Rather than fighting against it, moms can use it too to help their kids find what&#39;s right for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the mom&#39;s goal is providing nutritious snacks, then leveling out the playing field of food choices by paying attention to those other factors will allow kids to choose Oreos *because* they want Ores, not because they&#39;re easier or chocolatier or sweeter than the other choices. (But, as I said before, twisting yourself into knots to try to get kids to always make the more nutritionally dense choice is very likely to backfire. Relax! Make it *easier* for them to make certain choices.) <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen kids are young and convenience is a priority, it doesn&#39;t go against free choice to make nutritious foods more convenient than the less nutritious foods. It doesn&#39;t hurt to put the water and juice at the front of the refrigerator rather than at the back. Now if someone complains or the soda is always being moved to the front, it would be manipulative to always move it to the back. But if it doesn&#39;t matter to the child, and reaching into the back for a soda when they really want a soda rather than what&#39;s easiest, then making the less nutritionally dense foods a little less convenient doesn&#39;t go against the principle of choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Food choice backed by research (and Google)","postDate":"1363524202","msgId":70959,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxNjhFODY3LUI5OTktNDNEMC1BQ0IzLUVDRTZFNDg5ODlGOUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAzRTFFRkQ5OTYzMTRDMDVCNEE5NjIxOUZEOERGRTY0QFRoZUZpdHpGYW1pbHk+","referencesHeader":"PHBpYm42czQzZDM1MTFuYm91d2tjNnRnaS4xMzYzNDg4MTU3ODIxQGVtYWlsLmFuZHJvaWQuY29tPiA8MDNFMUVGRDk5NjMxNEMwNUI0QTk2MjE5RkQ4REZFNjRAVGhlRml0ekZhbWlseT4="},"prevInTopic":70958,"nextInTopic":70960,"prevInTime":70958,"nextInTime":70960,"topicId":70935,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... *If* the people who object to allowing kids commercial convenience foods are certain that even a small amount of these is poisonous then nothing we say","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1354977695\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; GMO corn syrup and this and that, refined, processed, not digestible<br/>\n&gt; to our system,,These cause you addiction, obesity,sick and diseases<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*If* the people who object to allowing kids commercial convenience foods are certain that even a small amount of these is poisonous then nothing we say here about food choice will mean anything to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n*If* you&#39;re certain that occasional convenience foods will lead to diseases and obesity far in the future, what we say here won&#39;t mean anything to you. The information here is for people who question that idea AND are certain that control will damage relationships and mental health. (Jenny&#39;s is just one of many stories members have told here of the damage their parents controlling what choices of foods they had as kids did to them.)<br/>\n<br/>\n*If* you&#39;re prioritizing your kids understanding food the way you do over them exploring to discover what foods are right for them, then what&#39;s said here won&#39;t be useful for you. The information here is for people who prioritize children exploring widely to discover what is right and meaningful to them. If someone wants that but also fears food AND is willing to work on her fears, members here can help with stories and information.<br/>\n<br/>\n*If* you&#39;re certain these foods are addictive, then unschooled kids should show signs of addiction. By the time unschooled kids are ready to leave home, their diets should show full blown addiction with convenience foods making up the bulk of their diet. But that doesn&#39;t happen. I would say as an adult my daughter definitely eats fewer commercial foods than when she was a kid. And when she was a kid she didn&#39;t eat that much. The appeal of convenience foods for kids is they&#39;re easy to grab, easy to eat, high in calories and carbohydrates. And the taste, texture, presentation is appealing.<br/>\n<br/>\n*If* you&#39;re certain that bodies can&#39;t learn the difference between what&#39;s digestible and what isn&#39;t, what the body needs and what it doesn&#39;t when manufactured chemicals are thrown in the mix, then the only evidence that would change your mind is unschooled children trying commercial foods once then rejecting them. You want to see evidence that kids can make the &quot;right&quot; choice, e.g., the choice you believe is right. It won&#39;t makes sense to you that people can choose commercial products for reasons *other* than the manufactured chemicals in them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat unschoolers have found is kids make the choices their bodies need as they&#39;re growing. If a home has snacks that offer the same advantages as convenience foods (as listed above), unschooled kids will eat them. (The foods need to be appealing to that particular child. So if a parent pays attention to the types of convenience food the child is drawn to, they can *also* explore natural versions and make -- with the child :-) -- homemade versions to give the child even more choice. How much of the commercial food the child continues to eat will depend on the child&#39;s taste. The more effort the mom puts into responding to that child&#39;s particular tastes -- and the less she fears him making commercial choices, the less she&#39;s invested in him making the choices she feels are right -- the more likely the child will choose natural foods. (Though if the goal is to have the child never choose commercial convenience foods, that&#39;s likely to backfire and fill the home with pressure and tension. It&#39;s important that the goal be choice that appeals to the child, not getting the child to make the choices mom believes are right.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point isn&#39;t to find foods for the child to eat instead, but to be responsive to the child&#39;s tastes and offer variety so *they* can discover what feels right to them. By making choices, by exploring broadly they discover what they like and don&#39;t like and they grow to understand their body&#39;s language and learn how to respond to it. They do this naturally.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhereas the natural foodists are fighting against natural learning. They&#39;re certain that manufacturers are so clever they can make bodies want their manufactured chemicals more than natural chemicals. So the natural foodists need to make sure their kids have the information to keep the body from wanting the wrong things. But if that theory were true, since unschooled kids have a broad array of choices, they would be choosing a diet heavily ladened with manufactured foods. But the evidence from unschooled kids doesn&#39;t support that. When given choice, unschooled kids don&#39;t exclusively or even mostly eat convenience foods. They make choices each time. Real food *does* taste better. But they don&#39;t fear a pack of Oreos. Sometimes Oreos are just the thing you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s important to realize that all this food fear is arising *not* from how unschooled kids respond to a world full of convenience foods. It comes from the masses that are schooled and pressured and struggling with relationships with people who want them to be &quot;better&quot; and different than who they are. When kids are raised without that, when they&#39;re raised with parents who are supportive of who they are, who provide choices for their kids to explore what these &quot;want voices&quot; inside of them are asking for, they don&#39;t show the same effects as the masses.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the answer isn&#39;t as simple as eliminating convenience foods. The answer is change how kids are related to. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Food choice backed by research (and Google)","postDate":"1363517438","msgId":70958,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU2QUJDMTU1LTFFRTctNDExRS1BQTVCLURBOTBFNjU2QjM4NkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PHBpYm42czQzZDM1MTFuYm91d2tjNnRnaS4xMzYzNDg4MTU3ODIxQGVtYWlsLmFuZHJvaWQuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PHBpYm42czQzZDM1MTFuYm91d2tjNnRnaS4xMzYzNDg4MTU3ODIxQGVtYWlsLmFuZHJvaWQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":70956,"nextInTopic":70959,"prevInTime":70957,"nextInTime":70959,"topicId":70935,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Besides allowing pets, writing on walls and scavenger hunts, they have free food (breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks!):<br/>\n<br/>\n====================================<br/>\nIn one of the open kitchen areas, Dr. Welle pointed to an array of free food, snacks, candy and beverages. “The healthy choices are front-loaded,” he said. “We’re not trying to be mom and dad. Coercion doesn’t work. The choices are there. But we care about our employees’ health, and our research shows that if people cognitively engage with food, they make better choices.”<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the candy (M&Ms, plain and peanut; TCHO brand luxury chocolate bars, chewing gum, Life Savers) is in opaque ceramic jars that sport prominent nutritional labels.
