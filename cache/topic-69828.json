So the<br/>\nproblem for a really sensitive and imaginative child is that anything they<br/>\ncan imagine seems pretty much equally likely. Once they&#39;ve imagined their<br/>\nparents&#39; deaths, they have no way to soothe themselves with words like, &quot;It<br/>\nisn&#39;t likely to happen anytime soon.&quot; That&#39;s all we adults really have to<br/>\nsoothe ours own fears - outside of religious beliefs - and children do not<br/>\nhave that ability. For that reason, I&#39;d support my children&#39;s religious<br/>\nideas even if I had my own doubts. If they said, &quot;I think people go to<br/>\nheaven,&quot; I would agree with them without much comment. If that comforts<br/>\nthem, I&#39;d be happy they have that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would be pretty strong, as a mom, in saying to my own children, &quot;I&#39;m not<br/>\ngoing to die for a REALLY long time.&quot; Some people might object to that<br/>\nbecause you can&#39;t really know it. But, that&#39;s as close to giving an<br/>\naccurate estimate of the probability as the child can understand. The<br/>\nprobability is very small that you are going to die during her childhood<br/>\nyears. The probability that a 30 year old American woman will die in the<br/>\nnext year is .00059 - that is less than 6 hundredths of a percent - it<br/>\nrounds off to zero percent. I&#39;d go with that. If you&#39;ve made it to 30 years<br/>\nold, your life expectancy is another 51 years. You could say, &quot;I am<br/>\nprobably going to live to be really old - more than 80 years old or maybe<br/>\neven 100 years old.&quot; She still won&#39;t understand &quot;probably&quot; and it might<br/>\nsound like a promise to her. I&#39;d let her take it that way, myself. If she<br/>\nsaid, &quot;Really?&quot; I would say, &quot;That&#39;s what I think, yes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Sun, Dec 23, 2012 at 10:47 PM, jencookies43<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cookiesforthree@...\">cookiesforthree@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My children went through a period of fear of me dying and then fear of<br/>\n&gt; their Daddy dying or of themselves.

He *loves* walking around old graveyards, looking for interesting gravestones, seeing the names and dates on the stones and imagining who the people might have been, figuring out how old people were when they died, searching for the oldest stones we can find, wondering if we’ll see a ghost (and hoping we will :-)), visiting the gravesites of dead US presidents, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, he doesn’t want to watch the movie We Bought A Zoo because when we looked it up on the imdb database, it said the story centers around the mother of the children dying, and he says that’s way too sad to think about.  He wanted to watch the TV show Duck Dynasty, until he saw part of one episode where the family goes hunting for frogs which they then cook and eat.  He was ok with the hunting part and knows some people hunt for food – but he said he didn’t want to actually watch anything die. <br/>\n<br/>\nOur family has experienced the passing of two close relatives this year – and he’s so far processed their deaths as simple facts – they were alive, and now they’re not.  He doesn’t ask questions about what happens when someone dies or about an afterlife or heaven or such – but he does seem to like the idea that he heard on a Stephen Hawking documentary that energy can’t be created or destroyed and so even in death, a person’s energy is still around somehow.<br/>\n<br/>\nWatching him process the experience of relatives dying, going to cemeteries with him, watching and talking about movies and TV shows and documentaries that touch on death and dying, etc. has confirmed once again for me how very important it is to make sure to pay attention to each individual child’s interest level and comfort level with particular topics of conversation and exploration – to follow their lead to where they want to go, and not try to get in front and pull them along with you :-) <br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids might find cemeteries to be a big yawn :-) but would be really into dissection, decomposition, mummies, and such.  Others, when trying to process the idea of death, might want to go to church or talk about heaven, think about angels and reincarnation, etc.  Some kids go hunting and fishing, and others don’t want to give one thought to the idea that the meat they eat was once alive. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had assumed that because my son likes cemeteries, I should introduce a whole bunch of other stuff about death and dying - I’d have scared him and upset him rather than supporting his interests in a way that works for him.  So we take him to all sorts of gravesites, look up how different presidents died, get Haunted Hikes books out of the library and try to find local ghosts :-) and we leave We Bought A Zoo for those who like that sort of story.<br/>\n<br/>\nColleen <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":383312070,"authorName":"Cara Barlow","from":"Cara Barlow &lt;carabarlow@...&gt;","profile":"crbrlw","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Looking for help with anxiety","postDate":"1355920760","msgId":69869,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBRWhNejVLR3ZHc3I1dmJTa1EzR2JDcEx2WWtRWEcxOGJQXzFRSEtkbXY3and4MlFPZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDRkFCOUU4NzQ0NDE1OS0xOEI0LTJBMzAwQHdlYm1haWwtZDE0My5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDhDRkFCOUU4NzQ0NDE1OS0xOEI0LTJBMzAwQHdlYm1haWwtZDE0My5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":69868,"nextInTopic":69870,"prevInTime":69868,"nextInTime":69870,"topicId":69828,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"When I was in my 20 s I worked as a children s librarian.

I<br/>\n&gt; never<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; stayed overnight and she was always with my husband but she took it<br/>\n&gt; really<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; hard.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The feeling was compounded when an older friend of hers (12) told her<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; about hell. We are Muslims and this girl told her some pretty hard stuff<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; about going to Hell. I was in the next room while they were playing<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; together on a computer and the next thing my daughter came in petrified.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Both of those things have had a major effect on her I think. It<br/>\n&gt; manifests<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; itself at nighttime. We will lay in bed together (we cosleep) and she<br/>\n&gt; will<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; tell me she is scared of me and her father dying. That she wants to die<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; first or will kill herself when we die. She asks about hell and if we<br/>\n&gt; will<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; go there.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sometimes she gets so worked up about she can&#39;t stop crying and it has<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; actually made her vomit.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I tell her I understand that those are scary thoughts. That no we won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; go<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to hell and try and calm her down. She takes deep breaths and we hug and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; talk. Sometimes she says she will bury us in the garden or imagines all<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sorts of scenarios where she can preserve our bodies. I listen and<br/>\n&gt; answer<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; all her questions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sometimes I tell her that I think it&#39;s better if she can be positive and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; think about how wonderful our life is now and how long that will<br/>\n&gt; continue<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; for. Or maybe its not a good idea right before we go to sleep to talk<br/>\n&gt; about<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; how long our flesh will stay before we decompose and become skeletons.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;m not sure how to handle it. She gets so hurt and upset and I want to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; help her deal with these feelings. Is it ok to tell her to try not to<br/>\n&gt; think<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; about these things? We talk about feelings a lot anyway. I don&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; dismiss her feelings. I want to help her cope with them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; We&#39;ve tried listening to relaxation podcasts before bed and she also<br/>\n&gt; likes<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to be read to or listen to audio books. I&#39;ve also tried massages.<br/>\n&gt; Sometimes<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; she falls asleep during those and it&#39;s fine, but others times not. I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; asked her what will help or what first makes her think those feelings in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the first place but shes not sure.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I look forward to hearing your suggestions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Rachel, mum to Leila x<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homeschoolers.in\">http://homeschoolers.in</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thouartthycreator.wordpress.com/\">http://thouartthycreator.wordpress.com/</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://childrenmypartners.wordpress.com/\">http://childrenmypartners.wordpress.com/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thouartthycreator.wordpress.com/\">http://thouartthycreator.wordpress.com/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ourcreaivealtar.wordpress.com/\">http://ourcreaivealtar.wordpress.com/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; *&quot;Be kind to yourself and others,*<br/>\n&gt; &gt; *Come from love every moment you can,*<br/>\n&gt; &gt; *Speak of love with others.

I think it was things like eating healthy, exercise, wearing a seat belt, smoke alarms etc. That might help your daughter feel like there is some actions you are taking to try to be around as long as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could also talk about what can be done medically if you get sick or hurt. It might make her feel like there are things that can be done to help people not die when serious things happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was also reminded by one of the posts of the time I volunteered with children in the hospital. There were many that were facing their own death. There was a excellent play therapist at the hospital. She had a huge collection of children&#39;s books that dealt with death, but often not directly. They were not written especially for sick and dying children. They were your average children&#39;s stories. It wasn&#39;t even obvious to me that the books could be interpreted to be discussing death until the play therapist point it out to me.   You might look at children&#39;s books in that light and might find some that would help your daughter with her anxiety.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMeg<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cfebsleb@...\">cfebsleb@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":359707411,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"Robyn Coburn &lt;dezignarob@...&gt;","profile":"dezignarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Looking for help with anxiety","postDate":"1355858205","msgId":69863,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDcwMUM5Qjg4LTZGMDgtNDc3Qy05MDc1LThFMDVENjQ0MEMwOUBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":69862,"nextInTopic":69864,"prevInTime":69862,"nextInTime":69864,"topicId":69828,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On a slight tangent...There is a book you may find interesting, Philosophy and the Young Child by Gareth B.

My mom died when I was 4, so it&#39;s never felt right to me to brush it off, saying, &quot;oh, we&#39;re going to live a long time, don&#39;t worry about it.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I mostly responded to say that I think Leila is at an age when I lots of kids do start thinking about death--it may have been somewhat prompted by external events, but it&#39;s also likely part of a developmental phase.  I actually had forgotten about my son&#39;s period of anxiety about dying until you wrote.  He&#39;s 8 now, and it&#39;s been over a year since he got really, deeply sad about it.  It may help *you* to be more calm and centered with her if you&#39;re not thinking about it as something that you need to solve for her, but rather a period that she&#39;s going through, the intensity of which will likely pass.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGenevieve<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Dec 16, 2012, at 1:56 PM, &quot;rachel k&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rachk2000@...\">rachk2000@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi, <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My daughter (6) has had what she calls the dying feeling on and off for over two years.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think it stemmed from a time when I was in and out of hospital and was the first time we were ever separated for more than an hour or so.
