She also said &quot;no&quot; to me when I asked her for something that day.  I don&#39;t know if she has ever said that to me.  I think I responded with &quot;okay&quot; and then laughed at that too.  I love that she was expressing her autonomy and it made me happy, so I laughed.

I think we need to re-establish connection.  I know this will pass or settle down in a few days so I am just seeing it as humorous right now.  I used to think that I had to &quot;fix&quot; all of these little things but now I trust that our family values, mores will win out as long as the connection is intact.<br/>\nIf my children were acting out in this way I might look at the last couple of days and see if there were times that we failed to connect or if I had been too busy.  If all had been normal, I might see it as her trying on some new behaviors and make sure she was aware if she had hurt my feelings.<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\nHeidi<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------- Original message -------------- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Sandra Dodd&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n-=-My girls have started to pick up the<br/>\nmean and rude behavior. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has happened a few times with my kids, and because I still have vivid memories of kids <br/>\ntrying on (or unconsciously adopting) other kids&#39; mannerisms and tones, I would just very <br/>\ncasually say &quot;That sounds like something AJ would say&quot; or whichever kid it might have been <br/>\nthat season.

I think its harder to do that when the rude kids are family i.e cousins but when they are neighborhood kids I just cut it right off at the start. My son plays baseball and 1 kid on there is just nasty.  He said at the last game that he wanted to play with one of the other players pink bats. I thought wow, for him that is good.  Then another kid teased him and said that pink is not for boys, which in turn the nasty boy said &quot;well pink is for pimps too&quot;.  This kid is 8yo.  I was dumbfounded. When I hear things like that I thanks God that my kids are homeschooled. But I am always right there behind the bench watching and listening and the kids know it.  I am not afraid to tell them whent hey are misbehaving and being rude.  Although this is easier in this environment becasue there are rules about sitting on the bench and supporting the team.  But I have many friends whose kids i don&#39;t bring my kids to play with.  My kids even notice<br/>\n when other kids are rude and they ask not to go back to play with them.  I try not to shelter my kids but I also try to limit their interactions with kids that are just not nice.  1more short story...I went to my first homeschool birthday party for my cousins daughter.  It was the most laid back, subdued, non-stressfull party I have ever went to.  NO parents were yelling at their kids, the kids were polite, they focused on the presentation...I really was just a nice party. I told my cousin that afterwards and I really didn&#39;t want the party to be over.  3 hours of no yelling, discipline nothing!  I was astonished.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sorry ranted a bit there.  But I would limit the time spent. Then when they do play together I would be on top of everything those kids say. If they are in your yard then they play by your rules or they can leave. If they want to be nice and respectful then they can stay. Otherwise they need to leave until they can be nice.
