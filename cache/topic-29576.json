And I don&#39;t think you need a black-or-<br/>\nwhite solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut maybe you need more days where you let things slide, just <br/>\nletting her play Runescape and craft her own day. We have lots -- <br/>\nLOTS -- of days where there&#39;s no **activity for the day**. Instead, <br/>\nwe just hang out. Lots happens, lots of activities take place, but <br/>\nthere&#39;s not an instigator for any of it. It just flows. A tremendous <br/>\namount of fun and learning and family bonding time happens on those <br/>\nmellow days.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd remember that some people are laid back and happy to go with <br/>\nother people&#39;s flow. This is not a bad thing! The world would be <br/>\neven more frenetic if *everybody* were trying to drive! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd remember that your daughter will change. She might always be <br/>\nthat terrific friend who&#39;s always ready to jump up and do the fun <br/>\nthings that you suggest, but you will probably see more and more <br/>\nindependence as she grows into womanhood.<br/>\n<br/>\ndf</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"jenstarc4","from":"&quot;jenstarc4&quot; &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: waiting for someone else to suggest something","postDate":"1182878729","msgId":29582,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY1cmk2OSttYnMzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhBNTc3NzE4LURCMjMtNERBNi04RUNBLURFOTJBRUYzMzQyNUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":29576,"nextInTopic":29598,"prevInTime":29581,"nextInTime":29583,"topicId":29576,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... has ...

My 13 yo <br/>\ndd, who can decide for herself what to do, doesn&#39;t sometimes.  The <br/>\nfact is, I do plan stuff for my kids.  I ask them first if it is <br/>\nsomething they are interested in, then I make a plan.  I call the <br/>\nfriends for them.  If I left it up to my 13 yo dd, she wouldn&#39;t do <br/>\nit.  It would feel overwhelming to her.  For now, she wants me to do <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes she requests things to do, and I implement them.  I&#39;m sure <br/>\nit depends on the child and age, but some kids are happy to let <br/>\nothers do it for them and go along with the plan if it sounds fun.  I <br/>\nknow what my kids like and plan accordingly.  I feel that this is a <br/>\nhuge part of my job as an unschooling parent, to make plans and <br/>\nprovide interesting activities for my kids without them instigating <br/>\nit always.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think kids know all the options, I know I don&#39;t, and I&#39;m an <br/>\nadult!  I really think kids will naturally take over their own lives <br/>\nbit by bit as they get older.  You&#39;ll see it happening.  Until then, <br/>\njust do it for them.
