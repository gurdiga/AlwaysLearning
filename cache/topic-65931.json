Our culture (western Europe and its colonial spawn) moved to an in-print alpha female system largely--etiquette books.  But even in smaller situations, women decide how other people should act in social situations, and they (instinctively and naturally) try to pass that on.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Would your answer have been different if it was grandpa&#39;s male friend that<br/>\ninsisted the kids call their mother using a title rather then her name?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t.  Hypothetical situations aren&#39;t as good to discuss as the real ones.  Real-world, it was a woman.  I wasn&#39;t surprised.  I responded to a real-life question.

She has a relationship to the other people (close or distant) or the offending (to her) behavior took place in her house or sphere or her presence.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I say to someone &quot;Don&#39;t talk to your child that way,&quot; they can easily say &quot;Who does she think she is?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I were to say to someone (as I did one day when a man threatened to spank his daughter at my house at an unschooling gathering), &quot;Not in my house you won&#39;t,&quot; then &quot;Who does she think she is?&quot; is &quot;The owner of the house.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is NOTHING in the whole world that you (Claire) would object to in another adult/child interaction, then that&#39;s one thing.  If there *IS* anything (like spanking, or aggressive insult in public, or reports of sexual abuse, or whatever in the world it might be) that you would object to, then I wanted you to feel that, to imagine that, to try to understand why a woman would express an opinion to another woman or child on behalf of peace and safety, respect and decency.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":261223738,"authorName":"Claire Darbaud","from":"Claire Darbaud &lt;cdarbaud@...&gt;","profile":"cdarbaud","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Children addressing adults by their first names instead of their titles","postDate":"1330515272","msgId":65981,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBRzB1VzhrQjUwcjJrbTB0WFFWN3dPMHF6TFRrZlhPcVZQMHRRV25UZVk0TWhyaWNaQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDkzOTZBOTU5LTAwQTYtNDdFRS04RjA0LUVEMUM1RjUyRjA2MUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGppZ2ZhbStsNnM4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8NjI4OTFBMzMtNEUxQy00NDAwLUFDQ0QtN0UzRDBCNDExQTI2QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPgk8Q0FHMHVXOGtNOVRwNE5RTkNpRkVHZ2RjN2F0RzYxTU5yOXkxdWQyQ05PZXJxUmRYTGJBQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgk8QkFDOENBN0QtNjMzMy00MUVCLUE3QkEtQTYwNjY5RTJFNUIxQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPgk8Q0FHMHVXOG5zTEJCQ1NUK1NvPTAtUHhpX0s9WDVpeVZSVUxhb2gySkxoNERjUGFVZnpBQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgk8OTM5NkE5NTktMDBBNi00N0VFLThGMDQtRUQxQzVGNTJGMDYxQHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":65977,"nextInTopic":65983,"prevInTime":65980,"nextInTime":65982,"topicId":65931,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks Joyce, I get it now. :-) And it makes sens I think (I need to think about it more though).

It&#39;s inherent in women&#39;s chemistry. It&#39;s not strong but if it&#39;s nurtured by culture, it can make some women feel like it&#39;s a moral imperative to be the guardians of how people act toward each other. So it&#39;s unlikely a grandfather would even care what people call each other ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nUnderstanding why someone&#39;s acting as they do can make it easier to respect their needs and wishes even if you don&#39;t agree with them. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo it&#39;s not whether they&#39;re right or wrong in their actions, or whether they get to decide how others should act, it&#39;s about respecting their feelings and making them more comfortable when you&#39;re with them.

And they can be more generous with their behavior and adapt to the group rather than making it about themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs people are saying, What&#39;s the big deal about what people call each other? Is it that difficult to adjust what you call each other for that short period of time to make someone more comfortable? Is it too difficult to coach a child on what makes someone feel comfortable? If what the other person needs to feel comfortable is more than you or your child feel comfortable giving then don&#39;t visit. You&#39;ll both be happier since you won&#39;t be upsetting them with your behavior and you won&#39;t have to do uncomfortable things ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":261223738,"authorName":"Claire Darbaud","from":"Claire Darbaud &lt;cdarbaud@...&gt;","profile":"cdarbaud","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Children addressing adults by their first names instead of their titles","postDate":"1330502656","msgId":65976,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBRzB1Vzhuc0xCQkNTVCtTbz0wLVB4aV9LPVg1aXlWUlVMYW9oMkpMaDREY1BhVWZ6QUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBQzhDQTdELTYzMzMtNDFFQi1BN0JBLUE2MDY2OUUyRTVCMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGppZ2ZhbStsNnM4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8NjI4OTFBMzMtNEUxQy00NDAwLUFDQ0QtN0UzRDBCNDExQTI2QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPgk8Q0FHMHVXOGtNOVRwNE5RTkNpRkVHZ2RjN2F0RzYxTU5yOXkxdWQyQ05PZXJxUmRYTGJBQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgk8QkFDOENBN0QtNjMzMy00MUVCLUE3QkEtQTYwNjY5RTJFNUIxQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65954,"nextInTopic":65977,"prevInTime":65975,"nextInTime":65977,"topicId":65931,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"2012/2/28 Sandra Dodd  ...

People are spending a lot of time thinking and sharing what they know.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-respect? i mean, what?? it&#39;s a name for goodness sakes.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it can, in many instances, be a blatant show of disrespect not to use a title. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler&#39;s husband teaches at a medical school in the UK.  It&#39;s not a system with which I&#39;m familiar, and I was going to be introducing him to some people, and I asked what title he used.  He looked at me, and I asked what his students called him.   He said &quot;Sir.&quot;    So I used &quot;Dr. David Waynforth&quot; for one introduction, and &quot;this is Schuyler&#39;s husband, David&quot; another couple of times.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, in that class, one of the students called him &quot;David,&quot; or worse yet &quot;Dave&quot; or &quot;Davey,&quot;  how far would it go for someone to say &quot;respect? i mean, what?? it&#39;s a name for goodness sakes.<br/>\nok im done lol-&quot;     <br/>\n<br/>\nI think they WOULD be done!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-there is one woman who is friends with my mom, she gets SO UPSET that kevin calls me meg. i really have to keep her in check because she&#39;ll say something like &quot;I will give you a SPANKING if you dont start calling your mother mom!&quot; i mean who does she think she is? sheesh-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s a friend of your mother&#39;s.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes your fifteen year old son need to call you Meg where his grandmother&#39;s friend is if he knows it bothers her? <br/>\nWould he use really bad language in front of her?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the threat of a spanking is rude, but I think being dismissive of the idea of respect is equally rude.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128961575,"authorName":"Vicki Dennis","from":"Vicki Dennis &lt;vicki@...&gt;","profile":"vickitexan2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Children addressing adults by their first names instead of their titles","postDate":"1330372608","msgId":65942,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBTVN1N053akRFQXluNzRCZTMxQk56WlE1UVktVzZwel9zQkYzZkRwTTl3Z3E5eWNYZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGppZ2Jibis2b2U5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PENBQ3B0TUc9eFNxQlFjcFA3UkY1QVdEanVHd0hfMEYxNj1tM3dDLTQrd19IY3paa3Z5d0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JPGppZ2Jibis2b2U5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65938,"nextInTopic":65943,"prevInTime":65941,"nextInTime":65943,"topicId":65931,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Our two sons used Big Mama and Little Mama   but not exclusively.
