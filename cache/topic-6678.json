When we were stationed in <br/>\nOkinawa Japan,  my son Shawn was twelve.  The Japanese people liked to use <br/>\nAmerican kids in their advertising and commericals.  Shawn was a skateboarder <br/>\nand was auditioning for one of these as such.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he came home from the audition I asked how it went.  He said the woman <br/>\nin charge wanted him to come back next week, and bring his blond <br/>\nskateboarding friends.  Then he stopped, did a mental inventory, and stated, <br/>\n&quot;I don&#39;t have any blond skateboarding friends.&quot;  We ran over the list and <br/>\nfound many nationalities, all of which tended toward dark hair.  In Shawn&#39;s <br/>\nmind you were divided only on the basis of do you, or don&#39;t you skateboard!<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was so oblivious to race, that once when he told me his little girlfriend <br/>\nwas SO short, I asked him if her mom was oriental.  Oh, yes she is, he said, <br/>\nsurprised at the thought.  The idea of race just didn&#39;t matter or register <br/>\nwith him at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6668,"nextTopicId":6682}}
