Just in May of this year they upheld in a federal <br/>\ncourt (over a Camdenton Missouri case - again TOO CLOSE TO HOME) <br/>\nthat the state has the right to MAKE a child be evaluated under <br/>\nthe &quot;Child Find&quot; section of the IDEA. But that doesn&#39;t mean that <br/>\nthey can MAKE a parent give their child psyc. drugs. Now that&#39;s what <br/>\nthey&#39;re trying to do again in this case, MAKE the child be evaluated <br/>\n(and in their opinion put on stimulants for ADHD)claiming that the <br/>\nparents are neglectful for not having their child evaluated, etc. <br/>\nAccording to the same act, the IDEA, it is also unlawful for these <br/>\nsame people to even state &quot;he should be on medication&quot;!!! The HSLDA <br/>\nis opposing the May federal court decision as well. But from my <br/>\nunderstanding of the law they don&#39;t have the right to call not <br/>\nputting a child on psyc. meds as neglect and they should not be <br/>\nthreatening to take the child into custody, there are no legal <br/>\ngrounds for their threats! <br/>\n So that&#39;s my take on the situation, that they just don&#39;t have a <br/>\nlegal &quot;leg&quot; to stand on. Because today is a holiday they haven&#39;t <br/>\nbeen able to get any legal contact yet but hopefully on Friday they <br/>\nwill get things more straightened out. I&#39;m feeling somewhat better - <br/>\nUnfortunately one of my cats was killed last night by a &quot;hit and <br/>\nrun&quot; driver. I am frankly mad at myself because I saw him the day <br/>\nbefore just laying in the road and I didn&#39;t go and make him leave <br/>\nbut drove around him - I knew then that he was getting too <br/>\ncomfortable with the road. He as always been an &quot;inside/outside&quot; <br/>\ncat - the first one of those I have ever had, kindof like a dog that <br/>\nhe scratched on the door when he wanted in or out and he seemed so <br/>\nhappy outside - enjoying the world  - and up until 2 days ago seemed <br/>\nto stay away from the road I figured I would let him (not like he <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t continue to scratch at the door until I let him out <br/>\nanyways.) but now I feel like I could have somehow avoided the <br/>\ntragedy, Urgh! He was only a little over a year old also! <br/>\n Anyhow I am off to make some pizza dough for pizza for supper and <br/>\nalso I think my ds wants to bake a cake this afternoon which will <br/>\nhopefully cheer me up as I really am enjoying his new found interest <br/>\nin baking.

Even a kid who might be helped by Ritalin at school wouldn&#39;t require it at home.

They started homeschooling last <br/>\nyear because they didn&#39;t want to put him on meds and they were tired <br/>\nof defending their position to the school, so the mom decided to buy <br/>\na curriculum and homeschool him of which he is excelling at! The <br/>\nfather is a former meth addict, an addiction that he belives was <br/>\ncaused by having been medicated with stimulants for his supposed <br/>\nADHD as a child - so he will do ANYTHING to keep his child off the <br/>\ndrugs and now they are coming after them! This is just too close to <br/>\nhome for me! I am giving them the number for the HSDLA but I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow how else I can help.  <br/>\n  I have also been digging information about the IDEA act which says <br/>\nthe officials are in the wrong just by stating that &quot;the child needs <br/>\nmedication&quot;. BUT here (in Missouri) they just in May of this year <br/>\npassed in a federal court that a child MUST be evaluated for mental <br/>\nhealth because of the same law - the IDEA, the Child Find part <br/>\nsupposedly gives them permission. The family services/school <br/>\nofficials even told this family that they would pay for them to the <br/>\nUniversity for evaluation - This is where I had the horrible <br/>\nexperience having my son evaluated (eyeopening for me - Never went <br/>\nback) - They&#39;re so in the drug companies pockets that EVERYONE they <br/>\nsee has ADHD - URGH! BUT just because they have to be evaluated <br/>\nDOESN&#39;T mean that the parents MUST follow the treatment.<br/>\n  Apparently also there is a &quot;Child medication safety act&quot; that <br/>\nwould prohibit parents from being coerced into administrating <br/>\npsychiatric drugs to their children but it is stuck in the Senate <br/>\nafter passing in a landslide vote (425 to 1) in the House of Reps <br/>\nduring May of 2003. <br/>\n  Can anyone think of anything else I could tell the parents to <br/>\nhelp?
