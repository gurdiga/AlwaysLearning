And I am oh so VERY grateful.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, we five have our own stuff to attend to and we fb. If your child is over 13, I highly suggest fb. It&#39;s great fun and helps to keep me up with everything going on with them without being in their face about anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI make sure that we have time in the car to discuss, catch up, whatever, whenever we&#39;re attending some event in town.

So - clarification:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy assumption was that help is always offered, real ideas, new ways of  <br/>\nlooking at the problem, questions asked that might help the person  <br/>\nthink about it more productively, etc. So - I&#39;m for sure not  <br/>\nsuggesting not helping. My comments about detachment have to do with  <br/>\nthe emotional aspect of it - how to be sympathetic and caring without  <br/>\nbeing caught up in the emotions ourselves. How to stay clear-headed  <br/>\nand not feel our kids&#39; emotions so strongly that we are just as unable  <br/>\nto consider options as they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, it can sometimes be apparent that the kid isn&#39;t actually looking  <br/>\nfor solutions and doesn&#39;t want to make a change, but wants sympathy  <br/>\nfor their &quot;plight&quot; (the plight they&#39;ve chosen to be in). Roxana has  <br/>\ndecided to go to a university in the fall to study acting and musical  <br/>\ntheater. She&#39;s decided to finish all the general education  <br/>\nrequirements in her last semester at the community college so that  <br/>\nshe&#39;ll have only theater-related courses when she is at the  <br/>\nuniversity. All her choice - all to do something she&#39;s SUPER excited  <br/>\nand thrilled to do. If, halfway through the semester, she is moaning  <br/>\nand groaning about how awful her teacher is, in one of those last few  <br/>\ncourses, if she is frustrated at the teacher&#39;s grading policies, or if  <br/>\nshe&#39;s bored out of her mind and wishes with all her heart that it was  <br/>\njust over, then that is the time I&#39;d use that &quot;Buddha-like  <br/>\ndetachment.&quot;  I mean, if there is anything I could do to help make it  <br/>\nmore comfortable for her, I&#39;d offer that. But, I can imagine that  <br/>\nthere will be times during the semester that she&#39;ll really gripe and  <br/>\ncomplain, but not want help or solutions, just sympathy. These are the  <br/>\ntimes I have to watch myself, not to let myself get worked up and add  <br/>\nto the emotional upheaval and drama in the house. That&#39;s the time I  <br/>\nneed to find my own center, be confident and calm that she&#39;ll get  <br/>\nthrough this. I can do the helpful things - make sure she&#39;s getting  <br/>\nfed well, help her get enough sleep, suggest any real options that I  <br/>\nmight think of. But I don&#39;t do anybody any good by getting my own  <br/>\nemotions involved, by feeling frustrated or angry, myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids will sometimes ask, &quot;Mom, can I just rant for a minute without  <br/>\nyou getting all upset?&quot; That&#39;s because I am quick to want to take  <br/>\naction, to solve the problem. One of my kids got a &quot;B&quot; instead of an  <br/>\n&quot;A&quot; in a design course because the teacher didn&#39;t give clear  <br/>\ninstructions about how to sign in and out of the lab. (My kid was the  <br/>\nonly person in the class that semester who hadn&#39;t taken the class  <br/>\npreviously.) She didn&#39;t want to appeal the grade or complain about it  <br/>\nto the teacher, but she was upset about it. I&#39;m a person who takes  <br/>\naction when I&#39;m upset; she really wanted to be able to complain to me,  <br/>\nbut didn&#39;t want me to tell her what to do about it. I said, &quot;You could  <br/>\ntalk to the teacher about it.&quot; She said, &quot;I feel stupid that I didn&#39;t  <br/>\nunderstand.&quot; I said, &quot;She thought you knew, she wouldn&#39;t want you to  <br/>\nget a lower grade than you deserve.&quot; Roxana said, &quot;I&#39;m fine. I&#39;ll take  <br/>\nthe B.&quot; But she was emotional about it and I was picking that up and  <br/>\ngetting upset on her behalf and getting upset with her that she would  <br/>\nbe upset but not do something about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a couple of things I have to say about this kind of  <br/>\nsituation - but the most important is that the parent needs to find  <br/>\ntheir own center and not drift over to taking on the emotions of their  <br/>\nchild. That&#39;s too much empathy. Second is that there is only so much  <br/>\n&quot;emotional ranting&quot; that is reasonable to be expected to listen to - I  <br/>\nhave said, &quot;Okay, is it time to move on? Can you choose to be happier  <br/>\nright now?&quot; That might seem cruel, like it is discounting their  <br/>\nfeelings, but I know that my kids can get caught up themselves in the  <br/>\nemotions and find it hard to let go. That kind of emotion, negative as  <br/>\nit is, is a rush, maybe it is adrenaline, and comes with a feeling of  <br/>\nimportance and significance, and self-righteousness. Again, though, I  <br/>\ncan really only help them move on if I&#39;m not also caught up in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing is that some people are intellectually quick-thinking  <br/>\nand others process ideas more slowly. In the same way, some people  <br/>\nhave flashes of emotion and move quickly back to equilibrium while  <br/>\nothers build emotions slowly and/or get over them slowly. I have a kid  <br/>\nwho is quick-thinking in the intellectual realm and slow to process  <br/>\nthrough her emotions. So, in the first few minutes of some upset I  <br/>\nmight offer a bunch of ideas for solutions - she&#39;ll hear those and  <br/>\nprocess them. But she might not &quot;get over&quot; the emotions for quite a  <br/>\nwhile after that, even when the solutions make perfect intellectual  <br/>\nsense to her. If I keep repeating the ideas, as if she didn&#39;t  <br/>\nunderstand them, that also frustrates her and makes her more upset.  <br/>\nSo, I offer ideas, and I know she heard them and is considering them.  <br/>\nBut then I back off and give her time and space to recover her  <br/>\nequilibrium. If I&#39;m all upset emotionally, too, then it is going to be  <br/>\nhard for me to back off - but what my kid needs from me at that point  <br/>\nis to be calm, offer a cookie, smile benevolently, be more buddha-like.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":166322738,"authorName":"Nancy Wooton","from":"Nancy Wooton &lt;nancywooton@...&gt;","profile":"ikonstitcher","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Teens","postDate":"1229023370","msgId":40936,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgwNTBERjBDLTgzRUItNENBOC1CRjJELUVBRUY5OTQ0NjdBREBjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdocm9jNCsxN2JpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdocm9jNCsxN2JpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40935,"nextInTopic":40937,"prevInTime":40935,"nextInTime":40937,"topicId":23613,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Roxana, for example, is<br/>\n  taking an algebra class. She doesn&#39;t care much for it - actually, she<br/>\n  sort of likes the math but the teacher is way over the edge of<br/>\n  ridiculous in her demands for homework and tests being formatted<br/>\n  exactly her way.

Sometimes I<br/>\n  have to leave the room, get out of earshot, to keep from being sucked<br/>\n  in. When I talk to her, at times like that, I am careful to keep my<br/>\n  voice sympathetic, but also relaxed and confident that she can handle<br/>\n  it. I might say, &quot;Yeah, frustrating, huh?&quot; But not much more than that.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I still don&#39;t think we&#39;ve got the complete picture of what&#39;s going on<br/>\n  with you and your daughter.

If you keep your perspective clear and more simple, maybe you  <br/>\ncan help her let go of the stress more - maybe you&#39;re sort of adding  <br/>\nto it instead of being the calming influence that helps her settle  <br/>\ndown and be comfortable with her own choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a mom to three young women who are VERY intense - high energy,  <br/>\nemotional types - I have had to learn to do this over and over.  <br/>\nSometimes it means leaving the room, getting out of earshot, when they  <br/>\nare vocalizing their frustration or misery. Roxana, for example, is  <br/>\ntaking an algebra class. She doesn&#39;t care much for it - actually, she  <br/>\nsort of likes the math but the teacher is way over the edge of  <br/>\nridiculous in her demands for homework and tests being formatted  <br/>\nexactly her way. So, Rox will be doing homework and start getting  <br/>\ncranky and irritated and start moaning and groaning out loud. I might  <br/>\nmake a couple of sympathetic sounds, and I&#39;ll certainly sharpen her  <br/>\nbroken pencil and bring her a cup of tea, but I don&#39;t let myself get  <br/>\nhooked so much that I&#39;m also experiencing her frustration. Sometimes I  <br/>\nhave to leave the room, get out of earshot, to keep from being sucked  <br/>\nin. When I talk to her, at times like that, I am careful to keep my  <br/>\nvoice sympathetic, but also relaxed and confident that she can handle  <br/>\nit. I might say, &quot;Yeah, frustrating, huh?&quot; But not much more than that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still don&#39;t think we&#39;ve got the complete picture of what&#39;s going on  <br/>\nwith you and your daughter. You said; &quot;I can live with that but teens  <br/>\ncan be inclined to blame their parent for choices they are not happy  <br/>\nwith and spend hours glowering.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not my experience. Not when they are clearly the ones who made  <br/>\nthe choice. I don&#39;t see why any of the results of her choice get  <br/>\nthrown back at you unless she felt pressured by you to make that  <br/>\nchoice or to stick with it or something?<br/>\n<br/>\n  If my kid is glowering, I might ask, &quot;What can I do to make it  <br/>\nbetter?&quot; Again, I&#39;d be as supportive as I could be short of taking ON  <br/>\nher unhappiness, myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my kid was spending hours glowering at me over the misery of the  <br/>\nschool work she&#39;d chosen to take on, being unreasonable in targeting  <br/>\nme since the choice was entirely hers, then I&#39;d find somewhere else to  <br/>\nbe until she got over it. It won&#39;t do her or me any good for me to get  <br/>\nall worked up, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nHoping this is helpful as this detach/support balance has been  <br/>\nsomething I had to work hard on, myself.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":10649172,"authorName":"Ward","from":"&quot;Ward&quot; &lt;xtr581602@...&gt;","profile":"snoozem404","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Teens","postDate":"1228980756","msgId":40926,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI2NzdCQTFFQ0I0RjQxMzJBNEFCNTU3QTcxQ0IyNjkwQFdhcmR3aW5kb3dwYz4=","referencesHeader":"PEI2QjkxMTE0NTQ4OTRGODdBNUNCRDRDM0FDMzE3MjE0QFdhcmR3aW5kb3dwYz4gPEI3NzlDM0Q3LUQ1MjUtNDg0Mi04MTVCLTQyNENDMDIwRTQwMEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPEFCOUQ2RUVFNzUwQTQyQUNBRTE5NEQzQTU2N0E2NEYwQFdhcmR3aW5kb3dwYz4gPDIyMUEyQ0JBLTYwQkMtNDkzQS1CQjBDLUYyODJEQTQ4Q0Y0QkBtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40925,"nextInTopic":40927,"prevInTime":40925,"nextInTime":40927,"topicId":23613,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Pam, You said: I can t get what made you all so miserable.

You have all in different ways reinforced the postion I was coming through myself.

We have a relaxed run unschooling household for the past nine years but I have come up against a problem I am not sure how to address.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur daughter is 16 going on 17 - By way of background our country has a standard for admitting people under twenty to university (your equivalent of college) and in a nutshell it requires &quot;school&quot; credits from a fairly limited selection of prescribed subjects or you can take a gamble that they will accept you with some kind of equivalent status but no guarantees in advance.  As there is only a once a year opportunity to sit the &quot;school&quot; exams you have to wait another year if your alternative proves unsuccessful. Dd is a keen writer and at this point thinks she may wish to pursue a career in communications supported by a university degree and work on her novel in her spare time.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe University Entrance process is essentially a two step process unless you do math all the way through. Some credits in math are compulsory.  To complicate matters to get enough credits you need some credits which are internally assessed so you can&#39;t just work through things at home at your own pace as you need a school to &quot;assess&quot; work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t really feel like a radical unschooler but the messages I am getting from dd is that I have instilled unschooling values.  She hated having to hook into the school system.  She felt the structure was awful, the correspondence booklets useless and the work pointless.  I can understand her point of view. I tried to gently modify as much as possible but she was left feeling afraid she would not pass the courses if she did not do it the school way.  The upshot has been a pretty miserable year all round.  I am not sure how much of this is just being 16 going on 17 and how much is the school stuff.  We are now faced with choices for 2009 and at present we have a reluctant acceptance of more &#39;school&quot; stuff but the prospect breaks my heart.  There have been many tears shed and I am looking for encouragement and advice on going forward.<br/>\n<br/>\nDd does not want to take a gamble on submitting an unschooling transcript along with some credits from the system (which are not the ones specified) and I respect that but I don&#39;t really want to endure another year like 2008 either.

I have tried  to help prepare  <br/>\nthem for this for their whole life.  But I do  know that they all work into  <br/>\nthe <br/>\nidea that they want to be &quot;adult&quot;  as far as the privileges, but aren&#39;t as  <br/>\nwilling to realize the  responsibilities that go along with that.  I feel it  <br/>\nis <br/>\nmy duty  as a parent to help them learn that ----- <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*******Oh, no, it isn&#39;t nearly as drastic as it sounded in the  e-mail.  The <br/>\nway it goes is that at 18 we no longer give them their  clothing allowance or <br/>\npersonal allowance.  They are &quot;free&quot; to live at home  as long as they care to <br/>\n-  that has ranged from 1 to 3 years and still  counting - so far. (We do <br/>\ncharge rent, based on their earnings, to  teach them the reality - a bit anyway- <br/>\nof what it costs to live and  eat). What I meant was that the decisions of - <br/>\nwill I work, will I go to  school, will I buy a car, etc, become theirs ( we <br/>\noffer info and advice ).   By no means are they abandoned, but they have been <br/>\nsetting up their  savings/checking acct for a few years, have had jobs of various <br/>\ntypes, and  usually taken some college classes by then. <br/>\n <br/>\nThey are always welcome to come home if they need to - only Shawn did once  <br/>\nfor a summer job in his transfer from PA back to CA and then grad school.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy intended meaning, was that being grown up and making grown up decisions  <br/>\ncan be VERY difficult.
