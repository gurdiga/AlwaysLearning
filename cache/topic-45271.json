She has talked about having ballet lessons one day, but<br/>\nright now I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s the best thing for her.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI love all the things you&#39;ve already done to support her interest, and<br/>\nall the possibilities you see.  I, too, have a tiny dancer, and thought<br/>\nyou might find something useful in our story.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnalise started asking to take &quot;a ballet glass&quot; right around the time she turned 2.  At 3.5, we signed her up for a class at the YMCA.  Her instructor was very patient and did not rush any of the children (she was also Lise&#39;s tap teacher this year, and even better!).  The class focused very much on letting them find the joy in the dancing.  There were six girls in the class.  parents were welcome to stay, and the children to run for a kiss, hug, or drink if they needed one.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love all the things you&#39;ve already done to support her interest, and all the possibilities you see.  I, too, have a tiny dancer, and thought you might find something useful in our story.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo help break the ice, we first tried a Creative Movements class.  It was the first class she had taken, and involved circle songs, turn taking, and lots of physical movement with music, balls, ribbons, and scooters.  If she hadn&#39;t enjoyed that, we would have postponed the ballet until she was a bit older, since at that time, she was rather reserved and unsure away from our sides.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is a nearby Y or community center, you might see if they run programs.  Those are often a lot cheaper than going to a studio, and less formal and results-oriented.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve also amassed a collection of ballet books, pictures, magnetic dolls and puzzles.  This summer, I will be taking her to her first live ballet (opens the day before her 5th birthday...).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever you choose, I hope it brings joy to your little ballerina! =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;There is a microscopically thin line between being brilliantly creative and acting like the most gigantic idiot on earth.
