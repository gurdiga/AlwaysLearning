If we &quot;control&quot; too much of their education - we <br/>\nnever really get that joyful &quot;free and happy&quot; feeling that you expressed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be a fine line between &quot;offering&quot; a swirling, interesting, stimulating <br/>\nlife filled with possibilities and &quot;pushing&quot; nonstop learning opportunities <br/>\nonto our kids. Not every unschooling house has to be filled with nonstop <br/>\nactivity and visitors and travel and so on. People can live great unschooling <br/>\nlives that aren&#39;t as wild or exciting as some others. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow that my kids are older and have specific interests and activities that <br/>\nthey&#39;re involved with, I YEARN for the days when a slow rambly walk out in <br/>\nnature, followed by a bubble bath and some read-aloud time, was plenty of <br/>\nactivity for the day. I try really really hard to KEEP long days with no <br/>\nplanned activities included in our weekly schedule. When I check my calendar, <br/>\nto see if we can do something, I always have in my mind which days of the <br/>\nweek I&#39;m reserving to be just &#39;hang around&quot; days. On those days, Roxana will <br/>\noften spend hours and hours in her room - reading and writing or singing or <br/>\njust listening to music. Rosie will spend hours puttering around the house <br/>\n(making little messes everywhere &lt;G&gt;) - &quot;just&quot; playing -- with dolls or <br/>\nstuffed animals. I call those our &quot;benign neglect&quot; days - when I purposely <br/>\ntry to avoid interfering with them. I also try to really respect our weekly <br/>\npark day time and let the kids have as LONG a day as possible without adult <br/>\ninterference. We usually get to the park about noon and leave around 5 or so <br/>\nand even later as the days get longer. Those long hours seem important to me <br/>\nfor some reason - I don&#39;t like to go late and leave early - feels like <br/>\ncutting off something. I know that, for years, the best park time has so <br/>\noften been the last hour or two - after a few hours of play, the kids seem to <br/>\nsettle down into a calm intenseness that feels more deep and focused. I can&#39;t <br/>\nreally articulate what it is  -- but it feels to me like they are learning <br/>\nsomething really worthwhile at those times. Maybe somebody else can express <br/>\nthis in words.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna, like you, I try to focus on what I am giving the kids - the freedom <br/>\nand the support to be themselves and to really know themselves and to choose <br/>\nthe direction their lives take rather than feeling as if life is imposed on <br/>\nthem by outside forces.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is so much more important than learning about any specific subject <br/>\nmatter - if they grow up feeling &quot;in charge&quot; of their own lives -  all I can <br/>\nsay is WOW!!! <br/>\n<br/>\n--pamS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59432230,"authorName":"joanna514","from":"&quot;joanna514&quot; &lt;Wilkinson6@...&gt;","profile":"joanna514","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Digest Number 285","postDate":"1016897369","msgId":5778,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGE3aTcwcCtwNnZqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGY2LjE4Nzk4MjYzLjI5Y2RlZmU3QGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":5775,"nextInTopic":5783,"prevInTime":5777,"nextInTime":5779,"topicId":5775,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The ideas can go on and on. ... places and ... you ve been ... are just ... desire to find ...

I love my mom and think she was a very good one.  She just <br/>\ndidn&#39;t think our education was her job(thought she would interfere <br/>\nwith our schooling) and she didn&#39;t do anything to encourage us <br/>\noutside of school(and not much in it either).<br/>\nAynway, my point is, that it&#39;s taking me YEARS to grow and rediscover <br/>\nthat wonder I had so long ago in my life.  My children don&#39;t have any <br/>\nstuggles with this.  <br/>\nThough I could be doing more, and am stuggling to do so, my kids are <br/>\ncurious and learning and living a free and happy life.  I am so happy <br/>\nI can give them this freedom.  <br/>\nI am so happy I can give myself this freedom!<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Digest Number 285","postDate":"1016894951","msgId":5775,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY2LjE4Nzk4MjYzLjI5Y2RlZmU3QGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":5778,"prevInTime":5774,"nextInTime":5776,"topicId":5775,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Nancy,  Did you see the Charlie Rose interview with Ron Howard last night?

I thought he acheived that beautifully.<br/>\nThe scenery was so incredible, the cinematography astounding.<br/>\nNot to mention all the costuming and props.<br/>\nI guess they didn&#39;t rent any of the props from a warehouse, everything had to <br/>\nbe built especially for the movie.<br/>\nThey discussed details like what kind of silverware elves would eat with, and <br/>\nthen made it.<br/>\nI hope it wins a bunch of awards!  Great interview anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat, I know the struggle you are going through. I&#39;ve been there to some <br/>\ndegree myself in the past.<br/>\nOne thing I did before I was totally unschooling, was create &quot;unit studies&quot;. <br/>\nThey weren&#39;t your traditional unit studies that most moms do in a homeschool <br/>\nsituation, because I didn&#39;t make them do paperwork type stuff.<br/>\nThe kids picked a topic and I would gather art, science and other fun <br/>\nprojects centered around that topic.<br/>\nWe all did them together and I would even make a snack that fit the topic. We <br/>\nmade cottage cheese &quot;turtles&quot; when we did the ocean theme.<br/>\nIt was fun, the kids didn&#39;t balk because it was all project, hands-on <br/>\noriented things.<br/>\nIf they got bored with something, they could walk away, or move on to <br/>\nsomething else.<br/>\nOur butterfly unit involved hatching butterflies and releasing them, visiting <br/>\na butterfly house etc...<br/>\nI say school has drained you of  YOUR desire to learn.<br/>\nLife is fascinating, there is a ton of cool things to see and do.<br/>\nI realize that there are different levels of interest from person to <br/>\nperson....but if you have NO desire to learn about new things, that is <br/>\ndetrimental to unschooling.<br/>\nI think once that desire is drained, it takes a long time to reignite that <br/>\nflame of desire.<br/>\nDon&#39;t give up.<br/>\nThink about things you always felt intimidated to try in school...maybe <br/>\npainting a picture, or photography? What excited you as a child? <br/>\nThink about things that bring pleasure to you....watching enjoyable movies <br/>\nhas been mentioned. How about a water fight, painting with your feet or body <br/>\non large paper, building a terrarium, visiting pet stores, taking a tour of a <br/>\nbakery and baking some bread at home...? The ideas can go on and on.<br/>\nLife is HUGE, the world is cram packed with interesting people, places and <br/>\nthings.<br/>\nIf there is no desire to find out about some of this, then I say you&#39;ve been <br/>\nhurt by school!!<br/>\nI also love being home and puttering. Most days the simple things are just <br/>\nwhat we need. But there needs to be some desire for knowledge, desire to find <br/>\nout when questions arise.<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5854,"nextTopicId":5892}}
