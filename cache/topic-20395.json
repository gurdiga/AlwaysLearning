You know workbooks, some curriculum,etc.  That was ok for a bit with my oldest, but was pointless with my youngest.  So I just started letting them choose what they were interested in.  I did not know actually a whole lot about unschooling, probably still don&#39;t.  But something has worked.  My eldest daughter, 15-is running several sites for actors in Broadway Musicals, and has developed quite a following of people.  She aspires now to be a publicist, or director, or who knows as long as it has to do with Broadway acting.<br/>\n  My youngest daughter 13-is interested in music, and writing.  She has a viviid imagination, and a very set idea as to how her life is going to go.<br/>\n  Both of my girls taught themselves to read.  We have always read to them all of their lives. <br/>\n  I have always kept phonics workbooks around, and tapes etc.  The eldest learned mostly by sight.  I got worried and tried to push phonics for her, but to no avail, and low and behold she can read beautifully, and has marvelous comprehension.  My youngest made use of the phonics tapes and books some, and learned as well with the same results.<br/>\n  So to conclude, I just keep our house full of interesting materials, and they do the rest.<br/>\n  Hope this helps, it is not as eloquent as some, but it is what we do.<br/>\n  Tina Hanson<br/>\n<br/>\nBob Collier &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bobcollier@...\">bobcollier@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">           --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;minker30&quot; &lt;mink30@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; i am doing research and wondered if some of you could post for me.<br/>\n&gt; basically, i want to hear of why you unschool....did you always <br/>\n&gt; unschool or how did you come about doing it....<br/>\n&gt; do you see your children actually taking interests in things and <br/>\n&gt; learning on their own???<br/>\n&gt; any info is greatly appreciated...<br/>\n&gt; dominica<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHi, Dominica<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my story:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://parental-intelligence.com/bobcollierarticles002.html\">http://parental-intelligence.com/bobcollierarticles002.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of my children do whatever they like.

Her main<br/>\nmotivation was to meet people her own age.  She has always been a VERY<br/>\nquiet and introverted person, but with a strong personality and strong<br/>\nopinions.  She told me that she needed to be somewhere where she was<br/>\nforced to be with and talk to people if she were going to make friends. <br/>\nWe have belonged to homeschool groups and scout groups and she&#39;s really<br/>\nonly connected with one girl in the last five years.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also believe that a second motivation was to convince herself that her<br/>\nother public school friend was wrong when she told her that she couldn&#39;t<br/>\npossibly know anything if she didn&#39;t go to school.  So now she&#39;s been<br/>\nthere for a semester, she&#39;s had no problem with the school work and<br/>\nproven she&#39;s not stupid and would like to come back home.  BUT she has<br/>\nenjoyed the social part and says that if she does stay home she will need<br/>\nsomething that will get her out of the house and with people her own age.<br/>\nSo we have been trying to come up with ideas.  She&#39;s recently taken up<br/>\nand is really into playing the guitar.  She doesn&#39;t want to take classes<br/>\nin guitar playing (she and her dad are doing this together) but she might<br/>\ntake a class in music theory - but where and how with people her own age?<br/>\n She doesn&#39;t feel confident enough socially or in her playing ability to<br/>\nplay with others so no playing in a band.  She was into gymnastics for<br/>\nyears but now has little desire to do anything physical.  What about art?<br/>\n Maybe, but she&#39;s in a funny in between age group - classes seem to be<br/>\nfor younger or older ages.  What about a job?  She says maybe but it has<br/>\nto be something fun.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m stumped.  Do I just leave her with all these options and let it go? <br/>\nI don&#39;t really care which direction she goes but she&#39;s really struggling.<br/>\n We&#39;ve talked about how there never really is a perfect solution to<br/>\nthings.  That there will always be parts of anything you do that are<br/>\nfrustrating or irritating and that you need to weigh the benefits against<br/>\nthe negatives.  The semester ends next week and I know she is trying to<br/>\nmake a decision by then.  So I guess I&#39;m wondering what else I can or<br/>\nshould be doing to help her make this decision and does anyone have any<br/>\nideas about other activities that could help her be with her peers? <br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristi</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":160772665,"authorName":"Gold Standard","from":"&quot;Gold Standard&quot; &lt;contact@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"[AlwaysLearning] question","postDate":"1093407935","msgId":20498,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFBBRUlKS0hPQkFIRkNERElJS09JTUVGS0NKQUEuY29udGFjdEBib2FyZHByZXAubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":20492,"nextInTopic":24064,"prevInTime":20497,"nextInTime":20499,"topicId":20395,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The problem we are having is the kids are in emotional overload when they get home.
