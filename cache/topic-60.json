And to carry that thought a little further - it also implies that it <br/>\nonly MATTERS if you know something for a moment - there is no point to <br/>\ndeeper, richer learning --- and that there is no point to &quot;wallowing in it&quot; <br/>\n-- much less any point to just enjoying it.  This results in parents asking, <br/>\nwith concern, about their kids wanting to read books that are too &quot;low&quot; for <br/>\nthem. Or always reading one kind of book - &quot;He just won&#39;t read fiction,&quot; for <br/>\nexample.<br/>\n<br/>\nAh - and it ties back in with those obsessive qualities and how parents worry <br/>\nabout that in their kids --- we&#39;re TRAINED, most of us, to value learning <br/>\nthat is a mile wide and an inch deep and doesn&#39;t &quot;stick&quot; anyway. So it looks <br/>\nweird and like, at best, a waste of time, for kids to want to stick with one <br/>\nthing too much. We have many years of &quot;school schedules,&quot; too, that we&#39;ve <br/>\nincorporated into our beings. So we might feel discomfort when our kids don&#39;t <br/>\ndo a little of everything on a regular basis - a little reading, a little <br/>\nscience, a little math, a little history, and so on. I know that it <br/>\nencouraged me to keep a journal when we first started homeschooling - because <br/>\nI observed the kids and noted what they did (on their own) that was related <br/>\nto all these different subject areas. It comforted me. Nowadays, I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\ncare -- it wouldn&#39;t comfort me because it doesn&#39;t make me uncomfortable <br/>\nanymore if I don&#39;t see them learning stuff in different subject areas. But <br/>\nwhat Betsy said brought that back to me -- how relieved I was to see that <br/>\nthey did stuff that could count as history, science, math, etc., even when I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t plan it for them. And it was a good exercise for me to do - to start <br/>\nto stretch my way of looking at what &quot;counted.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\nPam Sorooshian<br/>\nNational Home Education Network  &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nhen.org/default.html&quot;\">http://nhen.org/default.html&quot;</a>&gt;&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nhen.org\">http://www.nhen.org</a>&gt;&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"nvux4DBNRa4n7sQrTt-1g57MxsmdQ5hXTv4lvR6eMTJ7tC4eUaULmszgyh0KUJTRNsBkyKyNhXQq","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] fantasy gaming vs real challenges (was Re:   Expensive G...","postDate":"1006889426","msgId":60,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyZC44M2JjNGZhLjI5MzU0M2QyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":108,"prevInTime":59,"nextInTime":61,"topicId":60,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
