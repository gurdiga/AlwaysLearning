It gave me a lot to think about.  I&#39;ve discussed a few of these things with DH, and am making an effort to both share with him the seemingly mundane tasks of the day in a sparkly way, as well as making sure he and B get to talk to each other whenever possible.  They&#39;ve been emailing back and forth which is new and pretty cool.  (not to mention helping with spelling, sentence structure, etc, etc)<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t gotten into unschooling with him yet, mostly because he&#39;s going to have to go through deschooling with us a bit.  Luckily, we actually will be on vacation right after he gets home, so we&#39;ll just have to work on the respecting each other (B included obviously) and then we can talk about unschooling as an extension of that.  To a man who dropped out of High School in order to work in the real world, I think it might just appeal to him.  His biggest concern has always been the old socialization thing and we&#39;ve got that covered. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve had to be...stealthy...with MIL a few times.  She would start to say something that would make B feel bad/stupid/unloved and I had to interject with patience and understanding.

Dh works offshore, so he is gone for weeks at a time. (Although when he&#39;s home, it&#39;s all.day.long for weeks.)  I realized recently that I simply don&#39;t talk about B enough and about the day-to-day stuff for him to really have that connect that many fathers have.  When he is home, it&#39;s completely different and we often focus so much on what DH wants or doesn&#39;t want to do that B takes a back seat to it all.  I have begun to change this focus back to B, (especially since I stopped forcing math pages down her throat. lol) and letting him join the fun when he wants.  But he&#39;s gone again now, so I can breathe a little easier and focus completely on B.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI recently gave B her own email address for talking to family and stuff.

Not because she is mean but rather because she is soooo sweet and sooo attentive.  He feels like she&#39;s not treating him like an adult much of the time.  She absolutely loves me.  In fact, I think if I told her straight out what I was thinking/feeling she might actually listen.  The more I think about the issue with her, the more I think it&#39;s no problem at all.  We had dinner this evening and I concentrated hard on not letting her make a big deal out of B&#39;s silliness.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m hoping the answer to all of this will simply be in changing my own attitudes and behaviors and then diffusing any tense situations as much as possible by diverting the attention of the adult and soothing the hurt feelings B may feel.

I wished the things my husband and I faced were that simple. And you are truly blessed to have people that care about your kids that much, play an active role, and think in a positive direction! And great ways to disarm a conversation and still validate the person&#39;s concerns. Really good examples... <br/>\n <br/>\nAnd looks like you try to keep a positive sense/feeling in the home... much like me. ~*Smiles*~... I started out simple, with compliments, finding the positive/good qualities, and reflecting that in daily life… while trying to not have an “everybody gets a trophy” mentality. I make it a point to take notice of all positives in our home, like last night when hubby was playing with the kids, on the floor, on their level… or story time each night… and all those things that will make a difference in the long run!

We dealt with either being around us once every year or so when we served a purpose, or last minute back breaking labor, or when we were pawns in a bigger game they were pulling on others/each other! In a way it was a blessing to walk away, but left us with just each other. And after the childhhods we both endured, one might ask why we had anything to do with such dysfunctional people in the first place, but the bigger question for us has always been… how will we keep our home together/functioning/normal when we didn’t have a model to base it off of as children ourselves… one reason I NEVER judge others!!!

My MIL and Jayn share a love of making little things,<br/>\ncrafting. This would be the path to their connection.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other side of this is that if you want to help your dh be kinder and<br/>\nsweeter to you dd, you have to be willing to hear his criticisms of you too.<br/>\nMy dh is so great at seeing when I am being harsh, or inconsistent, or<br/>\nwanting to keep on doing what I&#39;m doing instead of turning my focus to Jayn.<br/>\nHe is great at pointing out how I am contributing the greater part to any<br/>\nconflict between Jayn and me, if I can&#39;t see it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nRobyn L.

I started homeschooling very recently, just this past Summer.  Unschooling is something I am very interested in, but to be honest have only just recently even started reading about.  I am trying to shift the way I approach my relationship with my daughter.  I grew up with a very emotionally and psychologically abusive mother (let&#39;s be honest, she hasn&#39;t changed) and overcoming the negative attitude toward my own child has been a long and slow process.  Since I found Unschooling and Sandra&#39;s website, I&#39;ve been more able to stop and see a situation before acting on it and choosing to be respectful and considerate instead of annoyed and spiteful. I talk to her a lot (I always have) about how sorry I am for my blowups or how I shouldn&#39;t have said x or shouldn&#39;t have done y and let her know that I&#39;m working on it, because I really am.  If I catch myself mid-flip-out then I try to explain that as well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, being able to see myself before I act has also given me the ability to see how my husband&#39;s action/reaction to her is so...just...mean.  She often doesn&#39;t even have to be interacting with him, just being a kid and he&#39;s totally on her just because he&#39;s annoyed or she&#39;s being silly (or the other day she put something in her mouth after taking it away from the dog and he just went off!) Not all the time, but many times I can even see that he sounds just like my mother might have.  I feel like (maybe I read somewhere?) I&#39;m not supposed to correct him in front of her, but at the same time I think she deserves to know that she shouldn&#39;t be treated like that. It&#39;s not just him, either.  Much as his mother loves her, she belittles her whenever she&#39;s around as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is about how to approach a situation where other people are being disrespectful to your child.  Not just random people, but people in your family or people that you care about.  People that are older than you and deserve your respect.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll probably have a lot of questions as I try more and more to implement the things I&#39;ve learned.  I&#39;m glad to have found this group.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":51233,"nextTopicId":51590}}
