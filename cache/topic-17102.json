They <br/>\nall remained at home until entering college. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie&#39;s kids are all doing well. One is married and has a daughter, and is <br/>\nworking as an accountant. Another graduates in December with a degree in <br/>\nTheatre, and is applying for graduate school. One child is a journey man in the <br/>\nheating/air conditioning field. Her daughter, Donika, majors in music and dance at <br/>\nGrossmont Community College, and Trevor at 15 is still home. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie says, “It has been an amazing life experience, not only to watch my <br/>\nchildren grow to young adults...but also to watch the growth of the <br/>\nun/homeschooling movement.” Join us as she shares her experiences and offers sage advice <br/>\nto those who have questions about homeschooling and unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo prepare for the conference please read an excerpt from Connie&#39;s soon-to-be <br/>\nreleased book, Homeschooling Reflections, at: &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homefires.com/farticles/conniecolten.html&quot;\">http://www.homefires.com/farticles/conniecolten.html&quot;</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homefires.com/farticles/conniecolten.html&lt;/A\">http://www.homefires.com/farticles/conniecolten.html&lt;/A</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNote: This is a perfect opportunity for those who are considering <br/>\nhomeschooling to find out more about it!  If you know someone who needs answers to their <br/>\nquestions about homeschooling, please invite them to join the Homefires <br/>\nJournal E-List to participate in the e-mail discussion on November 3rd.
