Unschooling is certainly turning away from <br/>\na system, but it doesn&#39;t involve neglect and shouldn&#39;t involve anything that <br/>\nlooks like neglect.  It&#39;s more about happy learning than letting kids run around <br/>\nby themselves or run naked in the front yard.  Those are individual things that <br/>\nare pretty contextual.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur family lives one block from a HUGE 70 acre park with 7 playgrounds, the <br/>\nnearest being at the entrance near our house.  I wouldn&#39;t let my 9 yr old go <br/>\nthere alone, but I would let her go with a group of kids from the neighborhood, <br/>\nif they all knew to stick together and I could trust them to do that.

If anything, it provides a whole &#39;nother set of challenges, the kind you get when you&#39;re trying to unschool while living with people who don&#39;t understand what you want to do or why. In that sense, its rather like living with extended family. <br/>\n<br/>\nCommunities form because of shared Adult values, and that only leaves room for supporting natural learning when kids are perfectly sanguine about those adult values. The positive stories I&#39;ve heard about unschooling in community have stressed that its vital for parents to advocate for their kids against the community as a whole - its do-able, but its not easier or better, necessarily, than living anywhere else. You don&#39;t get the perfect village, you get a bunch of human beings with histories and baggage, most of whom are absolutely sure that &quot;respecting children&quot; means teaching them lessons about respect and &quot;natural learning&quot; means no plastic toys or electronics.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best fit for unschoolers in community - for anyone who may be looking - is something closer to an eco-village setup. Basically, the more independent your family is from the community, the less chances for conflict concerning how you&#39;re raising your kids. Income sharing communities are the least likely &quot;fit&quot; for unschoolers, as those will have the most ideological expectations as to how community members and their children spend their time. <br/>\n<br/>\nIts not impossible to unschool in community, but its not an ideal, either. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":257591843,"authorName":"Vivvie","from":"&quot;Vivvie&quot; &lt;vivvie1703@...&gt;","profile":"vivvie1703","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Expectations (not about UK) Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Radical unschooling communities in the UK","postDate":"1284309683","msgId":57252,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGk2aXZyaisyNDQ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEQ0NjJFOTVBLUQ4MTYtNDNERS1BQUI5LTczOTFCNDc4MjJGRUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":57251,"nextInTopic":57254,"prevInTime":57251,"nextInTime":57253,"topicId":57227,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
