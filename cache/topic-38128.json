It *sounded* cool. I tried to  <br/>\nfind ways to replace what was so cool about it, but only the online school <br/>\nwould  do. Our computer hadn&#39;t arrived by the time we left for the Live and Learn <br/>\n conference, and on the way home, I commented to Dave that now we were going <br/>\nfrom  wonderful freedom to having to go by someone else&#39;s curriculum. Wyl <br/>\noverheard  and said, &quot;I don&#39;t want to do it, now.&quot; Well, the computer had already <br/>\narrived  and so after we got the packages from the neighbor, we set it up <br/>\ntoday and  started on a workbook (easy, one page) &quot;story&quot; that they wanted him to  <br/>\nwrite-about travel in his home city or state. The instructions stated &quot;with a <br/>\n partner&quot;, so I offered to write for him. He knows how and does write, but <br/>\nnot  long things and still finds the process of making letters and words with a  <br/>\npencil or pen tedious, so I figured he&#39;d prefer help. He did. He wanted to <br/>\nwrite  about Kalahari (a waterpark in Ohio where there was an unschooler <br/>\ngathering this  past January), and so I poised my pen and waited. As I waited, I <br/>\nrealized typing  would be faster, so I pulled up a blank page and waited. He <br/>\nstarted out with  something he saw, and as I suggested he might think about telling <br/>\nthe story to  Scott (whom he just spent a good deal of time with at Live and <br/>\nLearn), who  hadn&#39;t been there before, and pretend he was telling the story to <br/>\nScott. He  tried to start a couple times but shortly melted down in teary <br/>\nwhines of  distress: &quot;It&#39;s to HARD!&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nNow for those of you who know Wyl, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be astounded at this  <br/>\ncomment from one of the most prolific, descriptive, verbose story-tellers I  know! <br/>\nI sure was. But I knew. I knew it was the pressure to perform that was  <br/>\nmaking it tough. It didn&#39;t flow. It wasn&#39;t natural. It didn&#39;t happen in real  life.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m learning that it&#39;s a darn good thing we didn&#39;t get into online school  <br/>\nbefore we found unschooling, because it would be too easy for the  <br/>\nfollow-the-instructions, start-to-finish parts of my brain to get sucked into  this whole <br/>\nshebang and become the demon mother-teacher from hell. I&#39;ve had to  re-center <br/>\nmyself several times already today. I&#39;m hoping that Wyl will get  whatever <br/>\ncuriosity he had about this thing satisfied soon and we can quit the  repetitious <br/>\nbusy-work and get back to real learning. He&#39;s already made several  comments <br/>\nabout the questions posed to him (&quot;What do they think, we&#39;re  stupid?!?&quot;) that <br/>\ntell me how monotonously drilling this &quot;education&quot; is, and I&#39;m  even more <br/>\nready to be done with it than when we first started the process of  signing up for <br/>\nit. Bleah. Hopefully, it will be over before any real damage is  done. <br/>\nBecause if my super self-confident story-teller can be sidetracked by one  *day* of <br/>\nschooling, I can only imagine what weeks, months, years can do to make  a <br/>\nperson hate the things that are being forced upon them in the most unnatural  ways.<br/>\n <br/>\nOff to research who to notify when we&#39;re unschooling again,<br/>\nDe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************Psssst...Have you heard the news?
