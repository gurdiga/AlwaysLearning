The conversations here are toward the  <br/>\ngroup and for the group, and anything anyone throws out there is  <br/>\nlikely to be dissected and laid out in the unschooling light.<br/>\n<br/>\nI LOVE advice and wisdom from unschooling parents.  There&#39;s a book  <br/>\nout by Rue Kream that would probably be perfect for you if you&#39;re new  <br/>\nto this (and one by me that might help, but Rue&#39;s is great for people  <br/>\nwith really young children).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a list specifically for parents of very young children, too,  <br/>\nyou might want to join instead of or in addition to this one.   <br/>\nAlwaysUnschooled.<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":43831080,"authorName":"Arlynn","from":"&quot;Arlynn&quot; &lt;abfab@...&gt;","profile":"abfabarlynn","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"New Here","postDate":"1138083218","msgId":24182,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRyNGdpaSthc3R0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":12226,"nextInTopic":24184,"prevInTime":24181,"nextInTime":24183,"topicId":12224,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Just saying hello, I m new to homeschooling/unschooling and am listening in to see how it is done IRL.

I have 2.5 yo b/g twins that <br/>\nI am currently homeschooling/unschooling in that we have decided not <br/>\nto send them to preschool like almost everyone does here in our area <br/>\nof NY. Over the past couple of years as I find my way as a new parent <br/>\nI am finding that I particularly like advice/wisdom given from parents <br/>\nwho did or are currently unschooling b/c they are so child-friendly <br/>\nand respectful. I have also been told several times by some <br/>\nacquantainces who are former teachers that I am probably more of an <br/>\nunschooler when they learn how we parent our kids. So, here I am to <br/>\nlisten and learn if I am indeed an unschooler as they said &lt;G&gt; and to <br/>\nsee where this journey will take us if it is so. -Arlynn</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"New Here","postDate":"1044548295","msgId":12226,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0Ljk0MjFjODAuMmI3M2U0YzdAY3MuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":12225,"nextInTopic":24182,"prevInTime":12225,"nextInTime":12227,"topicId":12224,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/6/03 2:47:39 AM Central Standard Time, AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1737486609\">In a message dated 2/6/03 2:47:39 AM Central Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; <br/>\n Because somewhere in there someone who&#39;s a certified teacher has to touch <br/>\nyou <br/>\n with a magic wand of some sort, huh? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNO, not at all.
