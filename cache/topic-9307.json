Well, it has waffled a bit, the 2 <br/>\nolder boys spent the last 3 years mostly sharing a room which was <br/>\ndirectly off of our master bedroom, while the youngest had a twin <br/>\nbed next to our king--and went between each.  HOWEVER, since we have <br/>\nmoved, and have a typical &quot;split style&quot; home with the master a bit <br/>\nremoved from the other 2 bedrooms, ALL the boys are sleeping in our <br/>\nroom.  The 5 year old in our bed, the 8 year old in the adjacent <br/>\ntwin, and the 13 year old was on the floor until I moved in his <br/>\nqueen bed into our room yesterday. --why should he sleep on the <br/>\nfloor when there are so many empty beds in the house?  No, we don&#39;t <br/>\nhave a lot of romantic nights--haven&#39;t quite figured out when/where <br/>\nwhen everyone is up until 11, and then we are ALL tired, BUT I do <br/>\nknow that they feel immense love, safety, thankfulness and happiness <br/>\nall sleeping in our one bedroom.<br/>\n<br/>\nDH loves it too--minus the lack of alone time, and the bottom <br/>\nline....it won&#39;t last forever--such a shame I think!  All the <br/>\nworrying, thinking about, researching etc was exhausting!--sure wish <br/>\nsomeone had just laid it out for me from day 1!--- Just stop and <br/>\nthink about your kids, their needs and how you can meet those <br/>\nneeds!  You know, our DNA is wired to NEED to sleep in the safety of <br/>\nothers.  Without the safety of other humans sleeping near, your <br/>\nsurvival is at risk (wild animals, cold etc).  Some things take <br/>\n100&#39;s-1000&#39;s of years to leave our hard wiring.  And some things <br/>\nshould not be pushed out so fast!  I also think the nighttime <br/>\ntogetherness is a silent bonding between all of us.  Not to mention, <br/>\nwho would cover them up for the 8th time at night if it were not <br/>\nme???<br/>\n<br/>\nKelley</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"bedtimes","postDate":"1031776305","msgId":9307,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE2OC4xMzkzMzEzMC4yYWIxMDIzMUBjcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":32630,"prevInTime":9306,"nextInTime":9308,"topicId":9307,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/11/02 2:45:35 PM Central Daylight Time, AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-99657896\">In a message dated 9/11/02 2:45:35 PM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I tend to think that Papa Bear could be a little<br/>\n creative, himself. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree, he needs a jolt of creativity once in a while.
