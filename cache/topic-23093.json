Not many other places in Canada.   <br/>\nBonfield. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my early 20&#39;s I had a &quot;Nuke the Whales&quot; t-shirt with an elegant piece of <br/>\nart.   It was funny at the time, in the context of the day.   But later people <br/>\nmade shirts that said &quot;Nuke a baby gay whale for Jesus&quot; and that much stuff <br/>\npiled all in one pile just stunk.   No clever turn, no simplicity.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if some people with absolutely no sense of humor and not much habit <br/>\nof thinking looked at that shirt and thought about real nuclear weapons and <br/>\nreal live whales, rather than the weird political snork it was.   Keith had one <br/>\nthen too, with a drawing of a bear holding a rifle, and it said &quot;Defend your <br/>\nright to arm bears.&quot;    His was funny because in the SCA his heraldic charge <br/>\nwas a big golden bear, standing with one forepaw raised.   Kinda like the bear <br/>\nin the drawing, and people who knew him knew all that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":10590565,"authorName":"conniecolten@aol.com","from":"conniecolten@...","profile":"conniecolten","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: T-shirts with hell","postDate":"1128272295","msgId":23093,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVhLjcyNzBkYjk2LjMwNzE2YmE3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":23094,"prevInTime":23092,"nextInTime":23094,"topicId":23093,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"When the  first T-shirts came out that said I m Bart Simpson -- who the hell are you?  my mom was appalled.
