Good for you for being able to manage your time better <br/>\nthan I...or thanks for sharing your time with us now that your kids <br/>\nare older and off doing their own thing!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy hubby started blogging after LIFE is Good.  I was very please at <br/>\nthis, since there are few Dad&#39;s perspectives out there.  Jeff is in <br/>\nHuman Resources, so sees more people in a month than I do in a year.  <br/>\nI think he gets asked about unschooling more than I do - and frankly <br/>\nis more open to talking with people that have no idea what it&#39;s all <br/>\nabout.  Anyway, he wrote in his blog about some of the questions that <br/>\nhe comes across.  Here is the link to his response: <br/>\nhttp://freeboysdad.blogspot.com/search/label/Common%20Unschooling%<br/>\n20Questions<br/>\n<br/>\nHope you find this insightful.<br/>\n<br/>\nGinger</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36402,"nextTopicId":36485}}
