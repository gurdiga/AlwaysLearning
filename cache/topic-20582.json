WE started out calling it that because the kids wouldn&#39;t come there  to <br/>\nstudy.  We found a local boys and girls club, they have after school  programs <br/>\nfor school kids but the facility wasn&#39;t used during the day.  They  had a gym <br/>\nand gym type equipment, pool tables, computers, fooz ball table, table  hockey, <br/>\ngames, tables and chairs, bumper pool.  We hammered out  arrangements for <br/>\nprice per child and basically we had the gym to ourselves with  the agreement that <br/>\nwe would be out in time for their after school program and we  would clean up <br/>\nafter ourselves.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt worked out great.  WE opened it up to all homeschool kids and found  that <br/>\nunschoolers were the only ones with a free enough schedule to come.   LOL it <br/>\nstarted off slow but by the end of the year we had 30 kids coming.   The thing <br/>\nthat was better than a park day was that we came even if it was  raining, and <br/>\neven older kids enjoyed.  It was so nice to see all ages  playing together.  <br/>\nThe kids would go from one game to another as they  liked.  We had no <br/>\npreplanned games or activities it was up to the kids what  they did.  Some kids would <br/>\ndraw while others would just shoot the basket  ball around.  Then more would <br/>\njoin in on the basketball and some would go  play something else.  Very free and <br/>\nnice.  I drove about 25 minutes  but we had some that would drive about 1 1/2 <br/>\nhours to come.  <br/>\n <br/>\nJust another thought,<br/>\nPam G<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":5047879,"authorName":"Susan Fuerst","from":"&quot;Susan Fuerst&quot; &lt;fuerst@...&gt;","profile":"jsf491","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Digest Number 1369","postDate":"1093809023","msgId":20582,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWM0OGUwMSQ2ZTdlMDJjMCQ2NjAwYThjMEB5b3Vyam9ua3c2OHRseT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwOTM3OTc4MTAuMjA0My44NjM0NS5tMTJAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":20584,"prevInTime":20581,"nextInTime":20583,"topicId":20582,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... neilinda@chesapeake.net writes: ~ Or,alternatively, what an unschool lifestyle is all about.

It is a lot of work <br/>\nto stay in touch.  I started the NCUnschoolers yahoo  list so that the <br/>\nunschoolers from around the state could be &quot;in touch&quot;.   That has been a<br/>\ntremendous <br/>\nhelp.  I do drive a lot but it has been worth  it, making friends across<br/>\nthe <br/>\nstate. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;,,, <br/>\n <br/>\nI know that&#39;s part of it for me...the alienation from school(and<br/>\n&#39;school-parents&#39;) friends as well as from school-at-home types.  I can<br/>\nrelate to the  &quot;I just want some friends&quot;!<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently opened up the issues with a friend/parent who started her<br/>\nchild in all day kindergarten this year.  We are sad for them, and I<br/>\n(naturally) think it is practically criminal to stick a five year old is<br/>\nschool all day!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mom thinks we can maintain a friendship as long as we respect each<br/>\nother&#39;s choices.  This can get difficult for me...what did someone say<br/>\nabout longing to have them truly &#39;see&#39; what school does and is.  I had<br/>\ntold her about some parents who decided their children couldn&#39;t come<br/>\nover to play because they want to be taken out of school, and being<br/>\naround others who have that opportunity, and live it joyfully, causes<br/>\nstrife for weeks in their household.  The Mom I talked to says she<br/>\nthinks the world of my children, and &#39;as long as they don&#39;t speak<br/>\nnegatively about how (her dd) is schooled, that she thinks they will<br/>\nmaintain the friendship.&quot;  But honestly, my children do feel negatively<br/>\nabout school...and are happy with our lifestyle.  So even without<br/>\nverbalizing it, they can cause others to question their lifestyle.  I<br/>\nguess it&#39;s possible to have some relationship, though it will have<br/>\nenough necessary differences due to scheduling, etc, already; plus one<br/>\nmore topic that is basically &#39;off limits&#39; along with religion and<br/>\npolitics!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, regarding what Pam said about lots of driving - I think that works<br/>\nfor lots.  It has been hard for me due to a basically homebody<br/>\npreference; in addition to having four children and one on the way, plus<br/>\ntrying to be frugal with transportation costs.....but it&#39;s worth a<br/>\nre-examine to find what works for the youngsters.  I also like the idea<br/>\nof a weekly play plan, though vaguely tried that last year...it fizzled;<br/>\nso I thought I&#39;d try the club idea....must get over that &#39;fear of<br/>\nfailure&#39; issue and dive in!!<br/>\n<br/>\n Susan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20556,"nextTopicId":20586}}
