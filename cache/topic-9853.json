I would listen to them already, but Julie thinks having an only  <br/>\nchild who is young and easy isn&#39;t enough.   I was speaking when Kirby  <br/>\nwas nine, and just didn&#39;t say anything I didn&#39;t know for sure from  <br/>\npersonal experience, or that I didn&#39;t know from having taught, or read  <br/>\nJohn Holt, or having been around other unschooling families.<br/>\n<br/>\nRippy and Graham Dusseldorp will be worth listening to, also, when  <br/>\nthey get the confidence to speak about unschooling and parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoon I can stay home. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd speaking of being home, there is this, in Albuquerque, in  <br/>\nDecember, and I encourage anyone who thinks someday they want to go to  <br/>\na serious symposium to come now, because life does not last forever,  <br/>\nand your children are getting older, and Rosie Sorooshian will someday  <br/>\nbe too busy with her own family to come and speak to other people&#39;s  <br/>\nparents, but this year she is going to come and speak, and lead a  <br/>\npanel that should include Kirby, my oldest, and my other two kids too,  <br/>\nperhaps, and maybe other older unschooled kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://allunschooling2012.blogspot.com/\">http://allunschooling2012.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nFor those on the other end of North America from where I am in the  <br/>\nsouthwest, you might consider Florida in October.
