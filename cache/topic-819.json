(It makes me realize why<br/>\npeople get fed up with unschooling nitpicking ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seemed shockingly uncaring to me that MA homeschoolers weren&#39;t supporting<br/>\nthe Bryants but apparently their case is based around their contention that<br/>\nthe compulsory attendance law goes against state constitutionally guaranteed<br/>\nparental rights so the law itself is unconstitutional. There&#39;s a hugely<br/>\nsteep learning curve involved in figuring out what in the world anyone is<br/>\ntalking about in order to try to decide if such a law can be (legally)<br/>\nunconstitutional and if so whether it is and whether that really has<br/>\nanything to do with the legalities of homeschooling in MA. Basically the<br/>\nrallying cry is too muddled to get everyone to answer the call.<br/>\n<br/>\n(The Bryants stance is they don&#39;t have to submit an education plan to be<br/>\napproved by the Superintendent since the compulsory attendance law is<br/>\nunconstitutional. One of the problems that prevents people from rallying<br/>\naround the case is that the education plan is not a much of a hoop to jump<br/>\nthrough (I use Carol Narigon&#39;s which I can pass on if anyone&#39;s interested)<br/>\nand the case law is very clear that the state can&#39;t dictate the manner of<br/>\neducation so unschooling is very easy in MA.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s been a good summary of the two Mass homeschooling points of view on<br/>\nthe case and why the Bryants aren&#39;t being backed universally by<br/>\nhomeschoolers in MA on the MHLA email list. (The second list has had many<br/>\nongoing discussions about it and others.)<br/>\n<br/>\nmasshomelearningassoc at Yahoo Groups (supposedly the MHLA list for<br/>\nnonpolitical homeschooling discussions but a good summary)<br/>\nMAhomeschoolers at Yahoo Groups (the MHLA list for political talk)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether the Bryants have helped the homeschooling atmosphere in Mass as they<br/>\nclaim, or hindered as MHLA claims, apparently no real changes can happen if<br/>\nthe foundation of the changes keeps coming back to the argument of whether<br/>\nto work with what is there (compulsory attendance laws and others) or<br/>\nwhether that&#39;s ridiculous because the laws are unconstitutional. :-/<br/>\n<br/>\nThe scary/sad part is the DSS involvement in what is by-the-legal-book<br/>\neducational neglect and therefore child neglect, but which doesn&#39;t match<br/>\nreality since the kids are clearly being well educated. (They probably know<br/>\na lot more about law than a lot of lawyers!)<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\n<br/>\nI also clarified that MA doesn&#39;t have homeschooling laws, per se. Being<br/>\n&quot;otherwise educated&quot; is mentioned in the compulsory attendance law. The<br/>\nrules and regulations on homeschooling are based on a case, The Care and<br/>\nProtection of Charles, that, sometimes ambiguously, states what is required<br/>\nof homeschoolers -- an education plan and the superintendent *can* ask for<br/>\nsome form of assessment but the parents need to agree on the form -- and the<br/>\nscope of the superintendent&#39;s involvement.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one wants to overturn Charles because if it&#39;s interpretted &quot;properly&quot; ;-)<br/>\nit makes homeschooling easy.

I&#39;m still learning. I&#39;m terribly <br/>\nthick-skinned, and have a tendency to assume the same of others. I&#39;m also a <br/>\nvery straight-up communicator, and really had no clue that some people in the <br/>\nworld have hidden agendas. I was and am particularly naive and susceptible to <br/>\nmanipulation when it comes to rooting for underdogs. I&#39;m also really bad at <br/>\nasking for help or appearing weak. Most of what I know about relating to <br/>\npeople in a healthy way has been learned pretty late in life. What I&#39;m saying <br/>\nis that I&#39;m no expert, but here are some things I&#39;ve learned.<br/>\n<br/>\nA very wise woman once said to me regarding gossip that the problem with <br/>\ngossip is not that people gossip too much, but that they don&#39;t do enough of <br/>\nthe right sort of gossiping.<br/>\n<br/>\nHurtful, slanderous gossip exchanged with the voice of the rather arch lady <br/>\nelephant in Dumbo and with sly winks is right out. Pretty much, if I find <br/>\nthat I can transfer what I&#39;m thinking about or hearing from someone with that <br/>\nsort of a voice, I really don&#39;t need to say it. Obviously, that&#39;s <br/>\noversimplified (and if you haven&#39;t seen Dumbo, I guess it&#39;s also hard to <br/>\nrelate to).<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, the right sort of gossip can bring a group together and be <br/>\nsupportive of a person. Suppose that someone in your group just suddenly <br/>\nstopped showing up to gatherings. You have no idea what&#39;s up. You call her <br/>\nhouse, no answer. You go over, no one&#39;s home. The neighbour comes out and <br/>\nsays, &quot;Oh, Jenny had to fly to Texas suddenly because her mom had a stroke.&quot; <br/>\nThat&#39;s certainly gossip (&quot;rumour or talk of a personal, intimate or <br/>\nsensational nature&quot;), however, I would maintain that it&#39;s the sort of gossip <br/>\nthat is beneficial. It allows the rest of us to prepare to lend a hand when <br/>\nwe can. Similar to this is spreading of good news (&quot;David passed his Ph.D. <br/>\ndefense!&quot; &quot;Shannon had a baby girl!&quot;) -- this is also by definition gossip, <br/>\nbut is a courtesy to the hearer as well -- perhaps they weren&#39;t aware, and <br/>\nnow gives them the opportunity to offer well wishes to the new Dr. or mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it interesting that &quot;gossip&quot; (when applied to people) not only <br/>\nreferred to someone who habitually spread gossip, but it could also mean &quot;a <br/>\nclose friend&quot; in days gone by. Also interesting to me that gossip is rarely <br/>\napplied to men.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If a friend comes to me and wants to talk about issues she has with someone <br/>\n&gt; else - isn&#39;t it gossip and should I not tell her to keep it to herself, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t want to hear it? Or is it a friend venting her frustrations and <br/>\n&gt; negative feelings to me, a person she trusts? Or, should I listen and then <br/>\n&gt; report what she said to the person she&#39;s talking about because it is only <br/>\n&gt; fair that they ought to know what&#39;s being said about them?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For me, truth has to do with what makes useful talk. If someone wants to blow <br/>\nhot air and lies around, I usually find that I&#39;m needed elsewhere, just after <br/>\nasking the person if s/he has spoken to the one they are talking about. If <br/>\nits just beefing due to putting up with grating personalities, I&#39;ll listen <br/>\nand do the tongue-cluck until they&#39;ve calmed down enough to &quot;rejoin polite <br/>\nsociety&quot; (as my mom would put it); no real input needed from me. If it&#39;s an <br/>\nhonest problem, then I listen sympathetically and offer advice. If it&#39;s an <br/>\nhonest problem that the other person is not aware they are causing, I <br/>\ncertainly will talk to the person about approaching that other person and <br/>\nbringing it to light. Sometimes our best helpers are the ones who aren&#39;t <br/>\nafraid to tell us our zippers are down and we have spinach in our teeth.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also learned that some people need intermediaries (another lesson from <br/>\nthat same wise woman, learned when I was venting to HER about how much some <br/>\npeople kept venting to ME...) to approach other people for them, and are not <br/>\noften good about asking in plain English for help. It may come veiled as <br/>\ngossip or venting. I have no problem running interference for myself, but not <br/>\neveryone is as thick-skinned. So when someone comes venting, I now am savvy <br/>\nenough to ask, &quot;Do you want me to talk to him about it?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI have also learned the importance of gathering enough information on a topic <br/>\nto determine whether it is truth or balderdash. Some completely true things <br/>\nmasquerade as absurd simply because we have had limited exposure to them. <br/>\n<br/>\nNaturally, just because something is true does not mean it should be spread <br/>\naround if the person doesn&#39;t wish it. But sometimes people do it because they <br/>\nneed support dealing with it. When I was going to have a biopsy to check for <br/>\nlymphoma, I really didn&#39;t want people knowing about it (see above, under <br/>\n&quot;weakness&quot;), but my husband really needed to talk to someone about it so he <br/>\ncould process it. Difference in family culture: my family were stoic silent <br/>\ntypes, his were talkers. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;ve learned so much about dealing with other humans from this wise <br/>\nwoman, and I continue to do so on a daily basis now that I&#39;m on this list -- <br/>\nthanks, Sandra!!

So men condemned gossip, and said gossips were lazy and <br/>\nshould be home doing laundry or ironing underwear.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about doing laundry together?  No, that leads to gossip. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The nuclear family&quot; and the isolation of pioneer life are legacies in much <br/>\nof the U.S. which is interesting now that the internet can bring everyone <br/>\ninto the same laundryroom, as it were.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is malice and there is information exchange.  If someone gets divorced, <br/>\nI can use knowing not to invite them both over together, not to send them a <br/>\nChristmas card together and so forth.  It&#39;s social necessity.  There are <br/>\nparts I do NOT need to know.  And finding ways to make one or the other of <br/>\nthem more unhappy is just hateful.  But failing to discuss it at all on the <br/>\ngrounds that it&#39;s gossip keeps much of culture from smoothly continuing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome things need to be discussed so that the person doesn&#39;t have to repeat it <br/>\nover and over for every person she meets:  miscarriage, childbirth, marriage, <br/>\ndivorce, death of a family member.   Those should be spread as the important <br/>\ninformation they are.  And the details are more or less needed by some, and <br/>\nnot needed by others.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing we can&#39;t prescribe or enforce is common sense.  Making rules like <br/>\n&quot;no gossip&quot; doesn&#39;t allow common sense the freedom it needs to operate.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose with more social skills and social awareness will make others&#39; lives <br/>\nbetter, and those with little to none will make people&#39;s lives worse.

How thrilled do you think <br/>\n&gt; I was??  <br/>\n&gt; Marty told me &quot;Michael told me to feel Holly&#39;s bones, and we did.&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; It <br/>\n&gt; involved putting their fingers inside a girl a year old.  Marty was <br/>\n&gt; three, <br/>\n&gt; came upon Michael messing with Holly, and Michael implicated Marty.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So I checked with other families and came up with four other <br/>\n&gt; incidents, <br/>\n&gt; usually with boys.  Each family had assumed it no big deal, hadn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; wanted to <br/>\n&gt; talk to the mom, hadn&#39;t wanted to gossip, just told their own child <br/>\n&gt; not to be <br/>\n&gt; alone with him.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And in fact, the mom had told me one day &quot;Michael needs to keep his <br/>\n&gt; clothes <br/>\n&gt; on when he&#39;s playing.&quot;  I said okay without asking why.  In NONE of <br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; incidents did Michael have pants off.  She had never said &quot;And your <br/>\n&gt; kids <br/>\n&gt; probably should too.&quot;  It was summer, and every day was water-day <br/>\n&gt; and <br/>\n&gt; sandbox-mud-day.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So as soon as the family came home I talked to the mom, who had been <br/>\n&gt; a really <br/>\n&gt; close friend of mine, as peacefully and sympathetically as I could, <br/>\n&gt; figuring <br/>\n&gt; we would figure out something positive and compassionate.  She <br/>\n&gt; wanted to <br/>\n&gt; offer to pay for counseling for my kids.  I said they were fine, <br/>\n&gt; that wasn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; necessary.  She said if it had been Lauren (a five year old; Kirby <br/>\n&gt; and <br/>\n&gt; Michael were six) it would have been okay, but that Holly was just a <br/>\n&gt; baby and <br/>\n&gt; that wasn&#39;t okay.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I had a huge physical wave of fear go down me.  I still remember the <br/>\n&gt; feeling. <br/>\n&gt;  We were on her front porch where the boys couldn&#39;t hear us.  I <br/>\n&gt; said, &quot;So <br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re saying it would have been okay with you if he had stuck his <br/>\n&gt; finger up <br/>\n&gt; a five year old girl?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She stopped, got quiet, and didn&#39;t look at me.  The question had <br/>\n&gt; short-circuited her thoughts and the dialog was pretty much over.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She hadn&#39;t been happy that I had inquired of other families.  She <br/>\n&gt; had known <br/>\n&gt; NONE of it, though.  She was denying that Michael was a problem.  <br/>\n&gt; She said <br/>\n&gt; &quot;All kids play at sex.&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They don&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Kirby hadn&#39;t had any problems, and I didn&#39;t figure he would, <br/>\n&gt; because between <br/>\n&gt; the two of those boys Kirby was the dominant idea-getter.]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So anti-gossip rules don&#39;t solve all, and go-to-the-mom rules don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; either.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe the thing to do is for each mom to use her own judgment about <br/>\n&gt; how to <br/>\n&gt; deal with stuff.  Some have NO ability to be confrontational and <br/>\n&gt; will need a <br/>\n&gt; go-between.  It&#39;s not a sin to ask for help.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This weekend we had ten houseguests.  One was a mom with two kids, <br/>\n&gt; and her <br/>\n&gt; treatment of them grated on me worse and worse all weekend.  I told <br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; person who had arranged for them to stay with us.  (It was crash <br/>\n&gt; space for a <br/>\n&gt; medieval feast; they had driven from Colorado Springs.).

He said he had issues with <br/>\n&gt; the way she <br/>\n&gt; talks to her kids and treats them too, but didn&#39;t know how to deal <br/>\n&gt; with it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So now, because of some communication, he knows the problem is bad <br/>\n&gt; enough <br/>\n&gt; that she&#39;s not welcome here next year (she&#39;s been here three years, <br/>\n&gt; but only <br/>\n&gt; had the baby last year as an infant and this year as a beginning <br/>\n&gt; toddler).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What turned the tide for me was her saying &quot;that little shit&quot; about <br/>\n&gt; her eight <br/>\n&gt; year old son, while he was one room away.  I don&#39;t have to have that <br/>\n&gt; in my <br/>\n&gt; house.  I defended him in the story analysis (he hadn&#39;t been where <br/>\n&gt; he said he <br/>\n&gt; would be when they were ready to go, but for good reason--and I know <br/>\n&gt; that <br/>\n&gt; building and those people and easily saw the kid&#39;s side).  I made a <br/>\n&gt; couple of <br/>\n&gt; suggestions casually about how to keep the baby from crying.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m considering writing to the mom, because if she never likes me <br/>\n&gt; anymore it <br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t matter.  And if she&#39;ll treat her kids better it will be good <br/>\n&gt; for all <br/>\n&gt; mankind.  And the wife of that same group leader is pregnant, and I <br/>\n&gt; would <br/>\n&gt; much hate for her to take the other mom&#39;s actions as any sort of <br/>\n&gt; model or <br/>\n&gt; pattern.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!

I know you said nobody has to, but <br/>\nif that&#39;s the group&#39;s policy, not following it is uncooperative.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo stories--one ten years old (names are common and kids have moved to <br/>\nopposite ends of the country), and one one day old:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a family in a babysitting co-op in which the little boy had been <br/>\nsexualized (by a neighbor, or vice versa; ultimately we came to think it was <br/>\nby the mom, and the neighbor might be a victim too).<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was messing with other kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI discovered it when he and Kirby were away for a five day fishing trip in <br/>\nanother state in a cabin without a phone.  How thrilled do you think I was??  <br/>\nMarty told me &quot;Michael told me to feel Holly&#39;s bones, and we did.&quot;  It <br/>\ninvolved putting their fingers inside a girl a year old.  Marty was three, <br/>\ncame upon Michael messing with Holly, and Michael implicated Marty.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I checked with other families and came up with four other incidents, <br/>\nusually with boys.  Each family had assumed it no big deal, hadn&#39;t wanted to <br/>\ntalk to the mom, hadn&#39;t wanted to gossip, just told their own child not to be <br/>\nalone with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in fact, the mom had told me one day &quot;Michael needs to keep his clothes <br/>\non when he&#39;s playing.&quot;  I said okay without asking why.  In NONE of the <br/>\nincidents did Michael have pants off.  She had never said &quot;And your kids <br/>\nprobably should too.&quot;  It was summer, and every day was water-day and <br/>\nsandbox-mud-day.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo as soon as the family came home I talked to the mom, who had been a really <br/>\nclose friend of mine, as peacefully and sympathetically as I could, figuring <br/>\nwe would figure out something positive and compassionate.  She wanted to <br/>\noffer to pay for counseling for my kids.  I said they were fine, that wasn&#39;t <br/>\nnecessary.  She said if it had been Lauren (a five year old; Kirby and <br/>\nMichael were six) it would have been okay, but that Holly was just a baby and <br/>\nthat wasn&#39;t okay.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI had a huge physical wave of fear go down me.  I still remember the feeling. <br/>\n We were on her front porch where the boys couldn&#39;t hear us.  I said, &quot;So <br/>\nyou&#39;re saying it would have been okay with you if he had stuck his finger up <br/>\na five year old girl?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe stopped, got quiet, and didn&#39;t look at me.  The question had <br/>\nshort-circuited her thoughts and the dialog was pretty much over.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe hadn&#39;t been happy that I had inquired of other families.  She had known <br/>\nNONE of it, though.  She was denying that Michael was a problem.  She said <br/>\n&quot;All kids play at sex.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Kirby hadn&#39;t had any problems, and I didn&#39;t figure he would, because between <br/>\nthe two of those boys Kirby was the dominant idea-getter.]<br/>\n<br/>\nSo anti-gossip rules don&#39;t solve all, and go-to-the-mom rules don&#39;t either.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe the thing to do is for each mom to use her own judgment about how to <br/>\ndeal with stuff.  Some have NO ability to be confrontational and will need a <br/>\ngo-between.  It&#39;s not a sin to ask for help.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis weekend we had ten houseguests.
