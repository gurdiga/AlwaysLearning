Cheap sets are fine with them.  Americans have<br/>\nto have everything look like solid <br/>\nperfection, new furniture, beautiful models to show<br/>\ntoasters, etc.  Some of the game shows in <br/>\nEngland are gloriously cheap and tacky.  And seeing<br/>\nwhat&#39;s typically on there, I get the TV-based humor<br/>\nbetter.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI get it now. I know what you mean and that&#39;s one of<br/>\nthe things I love about British TV, not everyone is a<br/>\n&#39;beautiful person&#39;. There are all shapes and sizes on<br/>\nBrit TV! And I know what you mean about the tacky<br/>\nsets, LOL! The thing about the sets is that they are<br/>\nactually very realistic (the house ones anyway). I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen in a lot of British houses and a lot of them<br/>\nreally are like that (where are the taste police -<br/>\nwhat IS it about the clashing carpet and wallpaper<br/>\nthing?)!<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I was ashamed at the American shows they were<br/>\nhappily watching.  Not ashamed of the Simpsons or<br/>\nSouth Park.  But ashamed that Brits had Jerry Springer<br/>\n(which I&#39;ve never even seen except a moment in<br/>\npassing).    An episode Little House on the Prairie<br/>\nwas on some afternoon on a weekend, I think.  And they<br/>\nwere getting Frasier, I&#39;m guessing in part because<br/>\nthere&#39;s an English character.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a lot of American shows over there (of all<br/>\nkinds). Friends was huge! Ally McBeal was popular and<br/>\nso was Sex In The City, Northern Exposure, Twin Peaks<br/>\n(remember that one), and X Files, among others. The<br/>\nother good thing about Brit TV is that it&#39;s not as<br/>\nprudish on the sex front as US TV (they even put on a<br/>\nslightly edited Emanuelle after 10pm). They also have<br/>\nfar more shows that include homosexuality and other<br/>\ncultures in everyday lifestyles. It surprises me<br/>\nsometimes how much more openminded the Brits are (in<br/>\ngeneral) compared to a lot of Americans.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeghan <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend your FREE holiday greetings online!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://greetings.yahoo.com\">http://greetings.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1844,"nextTopicId":1855}}
