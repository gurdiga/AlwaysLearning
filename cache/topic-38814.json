Once a week you would have this kind of talk therapy where  <br/>\nyou told your worst story and you were loved despite your worst self.  <br/>\nSo you never developed this alienation and isolation that split you  <br/>\nso far from your community that you could just walk into a McDonald&#39;s  <br/>\nand kill everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Then church became that place where people went just to look good,  <br/>\nand you didn&#39;t get that release of looking bad once a week. In a way,  <br/>\nthe support groups and 12 step groups and phone sex chat lines, all  <br/>\nthese contexts in which people present their worst selves and find a  <br/>\ncommunity despite their behavior, these have become the new Church.  <br/>\nThese are the new escape valves where people go and confess and are  <br/>\nredeemed by their peers.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s talking Catholic church there, with weekly confession.  It  <br/>\nhasn&#39;t worked that way for most Protestant churches for a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes people want a group like this for a sense of belonging.   <br/>\nThat&#39;s okay, and sometimes not okay.    It&#39;s not the purpose of the  <br/>\nlist.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Oh.  The &quot;he&quot; of the quote above is Chuck Palahniuk, who wrote Fight  <br/>\nClub and Choke.
