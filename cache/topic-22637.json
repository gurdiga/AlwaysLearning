My 8 year old autistic son","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1108397694\">Well I talked to my kids about the reading program at the library that <br/>\nI outlined here earlier: a prize for every 4 hours read.  My 8 year <br/>\nold autistic son Thomas could not grasp the concept of this program, <br/>\nmarking time in a notebook and getting prizes for so much accumulated <br/>\ntime, no matter how many times and in how many ways I tried to explain <br/>\nit.  So I told him I would show him when we got to the library.  Once <br/>\nhe had the booklet in his hand and I explained it again as I used the <br/>\nbooklet for illustration he seemed to get the idea.  He has trouble <br/>\nwith abstracts, and also with the grasping of the passage of time.  We <br/>\nread for ten minutes and he asks me if it&#39;s been 4 hours yet.  Having <br/>\nan analog clock to look at helps him a lot, with hands moving around <br/>\nin different places.  Digital doesn&#39;t help much since he&#39;s dyslexic <br/>\nand the numbers are just confusing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is only interested in getting the prizes and doesn&#39;t seem to care <br/>\nwhat the motivations are of the library for wanting him to read, <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t ask, doesn&#39;t wonder.  I just told him that the library is all <br/>\nabout books and it makes them happy when kids read, so they like to <br/>\nencourage it  lol.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo we got him the little booklet to track his reading time when we <br/>\nwent to the library this afternoon and he&#39;s been drawing pictures or <br/>\nputting stickers into the little squares in the book that represent <br/>\neach half hour being read to or looking at books himself.  He&#39;s not a <br/>\ndelayed gratification kind of kid and has this idea that a prize will <br/>\nmaterialize when he reches the 4 hour mark, or that we can go back to <br/>\nthe library instantly tonight and get it.  In fact he wanted to sit in <br/>\nthe truck and read for 4 hours and then go back in a get a prize, not <br/>\nunderstanding how long 4 hours really is.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been reading to him all afternoon and evening now, as time <br/>\nbetween meals prep and so forth permitted, and he&#39;s got about 3 hours <br/>\nmarked off.  This really is not that out of the ordinary around here <br/>\nthough, as he often hounds me to read to him until my voice gives <br/>\nout.  I keep warning him that the prizes might not be too spectacular <br/>\nand he needs to be prepared in case they are not what he&#39;s hoping.  I <br/>\ncan see a huge tantrum if he&#39;s hoping for and visualizing something <br/>\nspecific and the prize is disappointing to him.  Autistics don&#39;t shift <br/>\nthought gears easily.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile his 7 year old brother amicably (as usual) said Yeah!  he <br/>\nwanted to try it out as well, since his brother is doing it, and got <br/>\nhis own booklet.  I&#39;ve marked his time off for him because he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nseem to care much, and I know from experience with him that whatever <br/>\nthey give him, paper bookmark, eraser, pencil, plastic ring, whatever <br/>\ntheir prizes are, he will be happy as a clam and say &quot;Ooooo, thanks!&quot;  <br/>\nlol  He&#39;s a pretty easy kid.  He may not care to continue after the <br/>\nfirst prize if he doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s really cool though, just be happy <br/>\nwith what he got and say &quot;no thanks&quot; to marking off any more time in <br/>\nthe booklet.  I doubt he will read any longer than he normally does <br/>\neither way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI find myself wondering if this stuff actually works on other kids, <br/>\nbecause aside from being excited about prizes and keeping track of <br/>\nreading time it seems to be business as usual around here with books.  <br/>\nI guess schooled kids often avoid schooly stuff and shun reading <br/>\nduring their summer of freedom and the powers that be are trying to <br/>\ncounteract that?  Mine have never been in a school, or preschool, or <br/>\ndaycare, so it&#39;s hard for me to visualize what it&#39;s like in homes <br/>\nwhere there is another reality.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22658,"nextTopicId":22657}}
