Lately,<br/>\nthough, they are finding that their interests<br/>\nare diverging.  This is distressing for both of<br/>\nthem, but for my daughter especially.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey had a relationship that was so close, they<br/>\nalmost seem telepathic.  Now, as they move into<br/>\npuberty, they are having a really difficult time<br/>\nfinding mutually enjoyable things to do, which<br/>\nmeans they aren&#39;t &quot;hanging out&quot; as much as they used<br/>\nto, and they miss each other.  I should explicitly <br/>\nstate that this is a problem that they brought to<br/>\nme, as something that is troubling them, rather than<br/>\na situation that I am looking at and seeing as a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey came to me, and asked me to mediate for them,<br/>\nas they were feeling quite distressed.  We all talked,<br/>\nand listened, to one another for quite awhile, and came<br/>\nto the conclusion that it would be nice if they could find<br/>\nactivities that they could do individually but side by side.<br/>\nSo, my son could work a jigsaw puzzle and my daughter could<br/>\ndraw, and they could talk as they each did their own thing.<br/>\nThey feel it&#39;s not as nice as doing one thing together, but<br/>\nbetter than not spending time together at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut now, they can&#39;t think of &quot;enough&quot; (their words/their feelings) things that they can do individually but in tandem.  And so they feel that they still won&#39;t be spending as much time together as they would<br/>\nlike.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suggested that they might want to try making some new <br/>\nfriends, and also suggested that they might try taking <br/>\nturns doing activities that one or the other liked, with<br/>\nthe explicit understanding that then they would switch off.<br/>\nFor example, she might shoot baskets with him, in return for<br/>\nhim taking some time to draw pictures with her.  Both suggestions<br/>\nwere rejected:  they reiterated to me that they want to repair<br/>\n*this* relationship, not build others, and as to the second <br/>\nsuggestion, they said they&#39;d already thought of and tried it, and<br/>\nthat it didn&#39;t work.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end, we came to the realization that relationships have<br/>\nebbs and flows, and that they might just have to weather this<br/>\nperiod, with the realization that they love one another, even<br/>\nthough they don&#39;t necessarily enjoy one another&#39;s company as <br/>\nmuch as they used to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I could do more to help them right now, and feel that<br/>\nI am probably missing something obvious here.  I trust that<br/>\nthe wise people on this list will have some helpful suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Sturman<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://kelly-livingjoyfully.blogspot.com\">http://kelly-livingjoyfully.blogspot.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46871,"nextTopicId":46804}}
