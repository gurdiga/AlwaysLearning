There are two teams of three - one is a resident team of<br/>\n&#39;brains&#39;, the other team is made up of members of the public who are<br/>\ncompeting against each other for the highest score, the winner each<br/>\nweek then goes through to the next round. The underlying implication<br/>\nseemed to be that the member of the public who wins this competition<br/>\nand takes home the Einstein Factor trophy has proven themselves to be<br/>\nas brainy as the resident panel of brains. I think so - it was the one<br/>\nand only time I&#39;ve watched the show.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd what a crock it is. It&#39;s a remember or guess quiz show in which<br/>\nthe contestants are given three answers to choose from. The panel of<br/>\n&#39;brains&#39; gets its chance to remember or guess first and then their<br/>\nanswer is compared to the answers the contestants&#39; go for. A, B or C?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was one particular question about Body Shop founder Anita<br/>\nRoddick. Her parents came from which country? Is it (a) Italy, (b)<br/>\nCroatia or (c) Greece? I think the third option was Greece. So the<br/>\npanel of brains starts into this line of thinking about how Roddick<br/>\nsounds Croatian and immigrants often Anglicise their family names,<br/>\nperhaps Anita Roddick&#39;s family added the k after coming to England -<br/>\nnot even considering that Roddick might only be her surname by<br/>\nmarriage. So I&#39;m shaking my head as the brains go for Croatia and so<br/>\ndoes the other team and everybody gets it wrong and I say to my wife,<br/>\nwho was watching with me and used to be a Body Shop consultant, &quot;I<br/>\nthought everybody knew Anita Roddick&#39;s parents were Italian.&quot; Her<br/>\nmaiden name was Perilli, which, of course, if anybody had remembered<br/>\nthat, would have been a give away. So who were the brains on this<br/>\noccasion - the alleged clever people on The Einstein Factor or the<br/>\ntens of thousands of people who are familiar with Anita Roddick&#39;s<br/>\nbiography?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point of my story, though, is that it had little to do with any<br/>\n&#39;Einstein Factor&#39;. Remembering or guessing which is the right answer<br/>\nout of three given possibilities is more like a &#39;Monkey with a Pin<br/>\nFactor&#39;. Not particularly useful in the real world.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething not totally unrelated that&#39;s on *my* mind right now. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBob<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Melissa Dietrick&quot; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;melissa.dietrick@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; She *knows* so much, she is so wise, and creative and free, yet <br/>\n&gt; she will be tested on just a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; bit of knowlege, <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I got into a discussion about this sort of thing with my mother <br/>\n&gt; recently.

In italy, so far, there is no sign of multiple <br/>\nchoice tests.  They do oral exams and written exams...the math is like a math worksheet, I <br/>\nexpect.  I dont really have a clue. Its only been a few years that they actually do tests on <br/>\nelementary kids within the school.  So i really expect that they will give her some <br/>\nworksheets. Ask her to write something, read and comprehend, and do some math. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter writing this morning, my dd woke up and I got a reminder of why I am so worried. <br/>\nShe had a bad experience entering in the first grade. We have always done a gentle entry <br/>\nfor our children, letting them stay home when ever they wished, and with Shanti, she <br/>\nseemed okay at first.  But bit by bit things added up (wont go into details here) and by <br/>\nNovember she was staying home more than she was going. After the xmas holidays, we  <br/>\npulled her out, but not without her having paid for our tardiness...she had nightmares for <br/>\nmonths and months.  So this morning, I remembered this, because she had a nightmare <br/>\nagain just before waking... <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so my fears are more from the gut, I think and the rest is the cover, maybe?  I m <br/>\nscared that this will cause her pain.  But Im also afraid to ask them to hold off on the test <br/>\nfor her...boh Im stuck.  Sometimes Im thinking if I could just shake the fear of everything, <br/>\nthe whole thing will flow without a problem.  <br/>\n<br/>\nso my question does remain however, about the test, how will this effect her experience of <br/>\nwhole learning, rather than fragmented learning? And should I give her a little &quot;prepping&quot; <br/>\nso that she doesnt feel any sort of overwhelming &quot;I dont get this, what is it they want from <br/>\nme?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nmelissa <br/>\nin italy<br/>\nmamma di 7<br/>\nlucia 20yr, lidia 17yr, matteo 13yr, raffaele 10yr, <br/>\nelena shanti 7yr, giacomo leo 4yr and gioele 2y<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;There is a Place beyond Rightness and Wrongness -- I&#39;ll meet you there.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRumi <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.larimeloom.etsy.com\">http://www.larimeloom.etsy.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.flauto.tk\">http://www.flauto.tk</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.attachmentparenting.eu\">http://www.attachmentparenting.eu</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":286713246,"authorName":"Melissa Dietrick","from":"&quot;Melissa Dietrick&quot; &lt;melissa.dietrick@...&gt;","profile":"melidi7","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: *my* testing anxiety","postDate":"1209879965","msgId":34629,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZ2amlpdCtvaHJmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZ2ZmIzYys3YWRjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":34628,"nextInTopic":34630,"prevInTime":34628,"nextInTime":34630,"topicId":34597,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi robin, I thought I had written you but I see that I must have closed witout sending. ...

How can I? no one agrees with me!  Ive never <br/>\nmet a homeschooled family here in italy yet, except by email, and then thats only 3 <br/>\ndirectly, and 3 others, indirectly (mentiond by the other 3).<br/>\n<br/>\n Especially<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; since homeschooling seems to be even less accepted there than it is in<br/>\n&gt; France, the teachers will likely have never even thought about<br/>\n&gt; unschooling at all, much less embraced it as you have. And if push<br/>\n&gt; comes to shove, they would likely encourage you to put her in school,<br/>\n&gt; for her own good. BECAUSE they like kids. BECAUSE based on what they<br/>\n&gt; have internalized, that is what is best for her. And while that<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t &quot;ruin her life&quot; in all likelihood, it&#39;s certainly not what<br/>\n&gt; you would consider best for her, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, they could try to argue that, but since her experience in first grade before pulling her <br/>\nout had such traumatic consequences for her, I dont think they would ever convince me.  <br/>\nShe had wanted to try again for 2nd grade (this is a very tiny elementary school, with only <br/>\n25 children total, for 5 grades) and because the school mates are our neighbors and <br/>\nfriends, people she knows, she wanted to be with them...so we tried for 5 days.  BUt the <br/>\nschool would meet us half way. I insisted to be there till she got past the anxiety, I insisted <br/>\nthat she never be left alone in the  hallway (she refuses to enter the class at first), I asked <br/>\nthat the first and second grades be put together (as they usually are, but were not when <br/>\nshe was in first grade, and again, were  not in second)...so when they wouldnt meet us for <br/>\nher needs, we left.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; In general, I would suggest that you keep this in mind in your<br/>\n&gt; dealings with anyone in the system. I don&#39;t think paranoid is the way<br/>\n&gt; to go into it, but neither do I feel that you can believe that you are<br/>\n&gt; all partners in looking out for your family&#39;s welfare.

Whatever their personal<br/>\nmotivations, they *are* part of that system, and obliged to defend it.<br/>\nAnd you are the odd one out, however well liked your family is in the<br/>\narea. The fact that your older children are also supporters of that<br/>\nsystem (by their actions and even some of their &quot;not deschooled&quot;<br/>\nsentiments, as you described) could even work against you, in a worst<br/>\ncase scenario.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know I&#39;m speaking from personal experience here, but I don&#39;t think<br/>\nit&#39;s safe to assume that what others think is best for our children<br/>\nwill actually be what you or the children think is best. Especially<br/>\nsince homeschooling seems to be even less accepted there than it is in<br/>\nFrance, the teachers will likely have never even thought about<br/>\nunschooling at all, much less embraced it as you have. And if push<br/>\ncomes to shove, they would likely encourage you to put her in school,<br/>\nfor her own good. BECAUSE they like kids. BECAUSE based on what they<br/>\nhave internalized, that is what is best for her. And while that<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t &quot;ruin her life&quot; in all likelihood, it&#39;s certainly not what<br/>\nyou would consider best for her, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, I would suggest that you keep this in mind in your<br/>\ndealings with anyone in the system. I don&#39;t think paranoid is the way<br/>\nto go into it, but neither do I feel that you can believe that you are<br/>\nall partners in looking out for your family&#39;s welfare.

I am going to meet <br/>\nwith her next week, but for this year I expect the test to happen.  Next year maybe this <br/>\n&quot;regulation&quot; will be dropped. We did just change governments. What I do understand is if <br/>\nthe principal doesnt want to test, she doesnt have to.

Then the next year they would register him  <br/>\n&gt; for 5th grade.  Can you do something like that?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That is  clever! The &quot;regulation&quot; that came before this one (2006) wanted testing to happen <br/>\nin first, third and fifth grades but from what I understand, this was never done. the <br/>\nfamilies I exchange emails with have never had to do any testing.  And from what I gather, <br/>\nthe newest &quot;regulation&quot; (because again, they arent Laws, in the true sense) which was sent <br/>\nout the end of March 2008, has not reaped any other heads other than my own.  sigh.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor this year, I am pretty much resigned for the test. And Im hoping to change schools <br/>\nwith which to deal with.  I was hoping I could do it with a private school,  but regestering <br/>\nmust be with a public institution...or even the correspondence school you mention, but <br/>\nbecause we are &quot;part&quot; of the italian system already, Ive been told that sort of solution <br/>\nwouldnt work.  It is not recognised as a school, and so we would still be homeschooling.  I <br/>\nthink that the clonlara school works for&lt; both parents foreigners&gt; families. And especially <br/>\nfor families who dont have other children within the school system.  I cant vanish <br/>\nanymore.  At least not this year.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is there some sort of correspondence school you could sign up with  <br/>\n&gt; there?

But not <br/>\nskip it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIm rather reluctant to use this strategy here, as there is that clause that says &quot;if the parent <br/>\nis not able to teach&quot; then he must avail of the public school system, and the clause gives <br/>\nthe principal the power to decide that I am not capable of teaching.  Obviously I can take <br/>\nthis to court, but I would rather just slide by this year, at least...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-he principal looks up the information, as it seems possible, but<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; no, there is a new &quot;request&quot; ( &quot;circolare&quot;) from the Dept of  <br/>\n&gt; Education that all<br/>\n&gt; homeschoolers take an exam which I have come to understand is to see  <br/>\n&gt; if the child is<br/>\n&gt; indeed learning-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How binding is that?

But the circolare specifies 3. I <br/>\ndont really get why 3 are needed.  I suggested having the testing happen in our home, <br/>\nseeing as this is the environment where she learns.  That was no dice.  He did give me one <br/>\nlittle assurance:  I told him that I was worried because of her negative experiences with <br/>\nschool the year before.  I explained that we dont use the same methods nor arrive at the <br/>\nsame goals as might be done within a school context...he asked for a collection of her <br/>\nthings she has done and they would base the test on that.  So I said okay.<br/>\n<br/>\nThing was, Ive got no collection of works.!  just drawings, yarns she has  spun, cloths she <br/>\nhas woven, a few stories that Ive not even read as she likes to write for herself...and a <br/>\ncouple pages of workbook stuff here and there.  She has a formidible pile of books she <br/>\nhas read---hats she has sewn, dollies she has created but not much for basing their <br/>\nbeloved test upon.

I surely must have <br/>\nworded my post poorly as I did not get any sort of response, on or off list. So I am trying <br/>\nagain.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst the background, then my issues...<br/>\n<br/>\nHere in italy, homeschooling is garanteed by the law, as long as the parents have the <br/>\ncapability both economically and &quot;physically&quot;  (Im not remembering the wording in italian <br/>\nbut it comes basically to that)...  And according to this same law, testing is not required <br/>\nexcept apon re entry to the public school system,  except for the 8th year (end of 8th <br/>\ngrade).  All exiting 8thgraders must take a public exam and homeschooled children are <br/>\nincluded...all well and good.  THis information for me was what let me really go free with <br/>\nunschooling, because I had no fears for annual testing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen boom, the 15th of april, I get the letter that tells me to prepare a curriculum for april <br/>\n30, along with a request for admission to the exam for going into the 3rd grade.  I call the <br/>\nprincipal to clarify, We intend to continue homeschool so as I understand it there is no <br/>\nneed to take this exam...the principal looks up the information, as it seems possible, but <br/>\nno, there is a new &quot;request&quot; ( &quot;circolare&quot;) from the Dept of Education that all <br/>\nhomeschoolers take an exam which I have come to understand is to see if the child is <br/>\nindeed learning...I understand now that there are many children that are being kept home <br/>\nto work or worse, so that the daughters do not mix with unwelcome others...Or at least, <br/>\nthis is the fear, as I have yet to meet in person another homeschooled child. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a handful of us, doing it Italian Style (as opposed to expat style--they are <br/>\nbasically ignored as they are learning in english or foreign languages).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my fears are many and not all stemming from the exam per se but exasperated by it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am afraid she will feel inadequate if she doesnt understand  what is required of her.  I <br/>\nalready get this feeling that she thinks that she doesnt &quot;do&quot; anything (she is incredibly <br/>\ncreative and free and wonderful) because her two older brothers help her along this way.  I <br/>\nsometimes feel like they (well, mainly my 14yo, the 10yo not so much) are mobbing <br/>\nher...not full time, but enough that I am feeling overprotective, maybe...afraid for her self <br/>\nesteem...afraid that Pure Unschooling may just not be possible, as I have no chance of <br/>\ndeschooling my 14 yo?<br/>\n<br/>\nIm wondering about things that Ive read here and elsewhere where Sandra writes to just <br/>\nlet the child go into the test &quot;cold&quot;.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI just recently read this on Unschooling discussion and altho it was referring to a teenager, <br/>\nit really resonated as a Truth.  Yet Im scared.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat am I scared of? and can this be possible for a child of almost 8years?  She will be <br/>\nfacing 3 teachers, whom she does not know, in a strange environment, and they will be <br/>\ncovering all that they &quot;do &quot; in school.  GRanted, I am not required to follow the school <br/>\ncurriculum, yet, with basically no materials to show *what* she has done, they have <br/>\nnothing to go by to create their test...<br/>\n<br/>\nI have all sorts of books for &quot;2nd&quot; graders, with worksheets to fill out and such, because <br/>\nhaving had 4 children already go thru the second grade, these things acumalate (we buy <br/>\nnew books year by year in italy, but that is another issue)...<br/>\nSo I know what they will be looking for.  I am pretty sure she is fine for just about <br/>\neverything except long division and multiplications with carryovers (we havent ever <br/>\ntouched the stuff on paper, just as it comes up...she can see a bunch of orderly holes and <br/>\ncount that they are 5 holes by 10 holes and knows instantly they are 50. so I know the <br/>\nconcepts are there, so I said so, but I dont know if she can *do* them on paper unless I <br/>\nshow her first...I d really hate for her to have to do multiplication or long division and not <br/>\nhave the slightest clue.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelp!<br/>\nmelissa<br/>\nin italy<br/>\nmamma of 7<br/>\nlucia 20yr, lidia 17yr, matteo 13yr, raffaele 10yr,<br/>\nelena shanti 7yr, giacomo leo 4yr and gioele 2y<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;There is a Place beyond Rightness and Wrongness -- I&#39;ll meet you there.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRumi<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.larimeloom.etsy.com\">http://www.larimeloom.etsy.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.flauto.tk\">http://www.flauto.tk</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.attachmentparenting.eu\">http://www.attachmentparenting.eu</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34632,"nextTopicId":34639}}
