It&#39;s been a heavy snowfall winter. My girls have not wanted to get outside much. Mostly they have played all day with their Polly Pockets and dollhouses, Hot Wheels cars, &quot;Messy Messes&quot; (I dig out all the &quot;going-old&quot; items in the pantry, throw in measuring cups, spoons, a variety of containers that pour, add a dash of food coloring or sprinkles, and they go to town.) Playing on our inside rope swing, playing gymnastics, putting on performances, watching TV or movies, playing games on the computer.<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds great on paper, but then I realize that they&#39;ve not been asking me for help/answers/questions/etc. They&#39;ve not been proclaiming boredom, or asking me to help them find something to do.
