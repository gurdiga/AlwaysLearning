Our kids help <br/>\ngrow the food, prepare the food (my oldest two beg to cook!). We have <br/>\ngone through nutritional books together. We shop at a co-op together and <br/>\nthe kids have gotten to know the staff. We have what might be thought of <br/>\na &quot;dinner&quot; food for breakfast often, or vise versa, because that&#39;s what <br/>\nthe kids want to eat. It&#39;s a holistic approach towards eating.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne great way to have a decluttered home and not neglect your children <br/>\nis to talk to them about what kind of space they want for their own. <br/>\nWhat does it look like? How do we make it that way? Sit and sort with <br/>\nthem, rather than &quot;tell&quot; them to clean it up. Go the home store together <br/>\nto get the supplies; ask which parts (some, none, or all!) of the <br/>\nprocess do they want to participate in (for instance, one of my children <br/>\nis totally present in the design process but absent during demolition. <br/>\nAnother enjoys pulling out staples and knocking down walls but hates to <br/>\npaint).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing we&#39;ve done to organize books to a certain extent is to <br/>\nvisit used book stores. The environment always stimulates the kids&#39; <br/>\nminds to come home and see what they are no longer using to trade for <br/>\nnew ones! Their dad and I would probably just pile them up and build <br/>\nmore shelves :-). But our kids are more pragmatic...if they can get <br/>\nsomething new for something they no longer use, they&#39;ll freely sort and <br/>\norganize to make the trade.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve moved several times in the last few years. Keeping an eye on <br/>\nlayout is an important way to fascilitate a rich learning environment <br/>\nthat allows for both together and alone spaces. Our kitchen and eating <br/>\nroom is one big space and our library is just in the next room, through <br/>\na wide doorway.  We chose this over the very closed &quot;boxy&quot; other house <br/>\nwe were looking at when house shopping. The bedrooms are upstairs, which <br/>\nhas turned out to make a nice rhythm in the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our next house, we are considering a separate room  for clothing and <br/>\nlaundry...a sort of communal closet. It would eliminate the chore of <br/>\nputting clothes  away and also clothing clutter in the bedrooms, freeing <br/>\nthem up for better sleep and private desk/studio space, something our <br/>\noldest two children want very much. Does anyone else do this in their home?<br/>\n<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-.

This is why I started a new thread. I wasn&#39;t wanting to &quot;tell them <br/>\nthat settling for less...etc&quot;.  I was wanting to discuss a contrasting <br/>\nthought triggered by the first thread. For example: there was a need and <br/>\ndiscussion expressed in one thread. I even contributed some helpful <br/>\nhints to that thread, knowing all too well the need for a break or a <br/>\n&quot;down&quot; kind of time to recharge.

I think you&#39;re wrong in thinking that, in fact, other people<br/>\n&gt; can do it, just because you can. For example, I almost never had a<br/>\n&gt; time when all three of my little ones were choosing to go off and do<br/>\n&gt; something on their own. And if I did have such a moment, it was short-<br/>\n&gt; lived and I needed the sit-down rest. I almost always had to be<br/>\n&gt; present - I remember once I was on the phone with my mom (those days<br/>\n&gt; the phone was attached by a wire to the wall, remember that? &lt;G&gt;). I<br/>\n&gt; said, &quot;Mom, I really need to go, Roya has been out in the back yard<br/>\n&gt; on her own for five minutes.&quot; She said, &quot;She ought to be able to play<br/>\n&gt; in the back yard without you for longer than that.&quot; &quot;Maybe she<br/>\n&gt; should,&quot; I said, &quot;But I&#39;m not comfortable with it.&quot; For good reason -<br/>\n&gt; she was beyond high energy - there was no down time with her, ever.<br/>\n&gt; There was always something, some big plan she was engaged in, and she<br/>\n&gt; really needed my help to be able to safely do whatever she wanted to do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m not saying you are neglecting your kids to do it,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you may be far more efficient and skilled at this kind of thing that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I ever was or am, and maybe your kids keep themselves busier on their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; own than mine did, but if I&#39;d spent my time preparing three meals per<br/>\n&gt; &gt; day, from scratch, that would have taken considerable time away from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what I spent with my little children, for sure.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But you are, aren&#39;t you? The message I&#39;m getting is that &quot;mess is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; evidence of unschooling and order is the evidence of child neglect<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mom who consistently chooses other things over her children&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Because it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t your experience, or that of some others, it must not be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; possible<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or valid.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You might want to reread what I really wrote. &quot;You may be far more<br/>\n&gt; efficient and skilled at this kind of thing than I ever was or am,<br/>\n&gt; and maybe your kids have always kept themselves busier on their own<br/>\n&gt; than mine did.....&quot; Didn&#39;t doubt the truth of your own experience,<br/>\n&gt; but I don&#39;t think it is reasonable to expect that to be the<br/>\n&gt; experience of others. If it is, they know it, they aren&#39;t asking for<br/>\n&gt; help, they&#39;re fine, right? When someone writes to the list about<br/>\n&gt; being completely overwhelmed with several young children and feeling<br/>\n&gt; like they can&#39;t do everything, what good does it do to tell them, &quot;It<br/>\n&gt; IS possible to do it all - you ought to be keeping your house clean<br/>\n&gt; and cooking three meals a day from scratch and, in fact, doing it<br/>\n&gt; happily and easily while the kids go off and take some pleasant alone-<br/>\n&gt; time of their own just when you happen to need them to do that so<br/>\n&gt; that you can do housework or cook.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The message from your post was that the advice on alternative ways to<br/>\n&gt; deal with and avoid housework and cooking was just to let people feel<br/>\n&gt; less guilty about their failures as cooks and housekeepers.

I think you&#39;re wrong in thinking that, in fact, other people  <br/>\ncan do it, just because you can. For example, I almost never had a  <br/>\ntime when all three of my little ones were choosing to go off and do  <br/>\nsomething on their own.

I can say <br/>\nin our household, we have fully embraced putting kids and family first. <br/>\nBut organization and useful storage was not something I did only after <br/>\nthis...it&#39;s quite necessary when living in small living spaces, which we <br/>\nalways have done, and surely, surely I can not be only unschooler out <br/>\nthere that likes to maintain, for the good of the entire family, a neat <br/>\nenvironment that promotes creativity.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;they don&#39;t write about the days they spent shopping, coloring,<br/>\nmanaging disagrements; because the thought of taking the time to<br/>\nwrite about them is more likely to fill them with an urge to clean a<br/>\ncloset or something ;-)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI both write about this kind of day and clean my closets :-).

Focus there first. Everything else is a choice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; After that I think the most helpful thing we can do about the extras<br/>\n&gt; is help people find ways to make them 1) less time consuming and 2)<br/>\n&gt; choices rather than necessities, to help them again focus on what&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; important. 3 meals from scratch a day isn&#39;t important. It *is*<br/>\n&gt; helpful to see 3 meals from scratch as a gift someone wants -- freely<br/>\n&gt; *chooses* -- to give their family rather than something the family<br/>\n&gt; needs. It&#39;s a present, not a necessity. If someone is taking from the<br/>\n&gt; family (time, sending negativity into the environment) to give the<br/>\n&gt; family a gift that the family doesn&#39;t necessarily want, then it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; helpful to see it clearly in that light that it isn&#39;t a gift. It&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; vision of perfect homelife mom&#39;s trying to impose on the family.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think tips on how people do family maintenance is great. (There&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; useful thread at UnschoolingDiscussion on storage.) I think too much<br/>\n&gt; moves the focus away from the kids onto the extras. The extras are<br/>\n&gt; advanced unschooling ;-) They&#39;re only for after people have fully<br/>\n&gt; embraced putting kids and family first.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rather than a pervasive imagery that implies unschoolers are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; messy, tv-watchin&#39;, gaming, chubbies (what I&#39;ve heard about it irl and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the image I most come into contact with in conversations with others).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; People whose kids choose not to watch TV, don&#39;t like video games, who<br/>\n&gt; are active, only eat organic food by choice don&#39;t write in to ask for<br/>\n&gt; helpful suggestions!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The advice obviously does skew towards helping people be comfortable<br/>\n&gt; with what they perceive as problems. The picture we paint on lists<br/>\n&gt; and boards tends to be skewed because we&#39;re dealing with problems.<br/>\n&gt; Just as a dermatologist&#39;s office tends to be skewed towards people<br/>\n&gt; with skin problems, totally ignoring the majority of the population<br/>\n&gt; who doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are Days In the Life collections.

The girls got fancy dresses from  <br/>\nthrift stores and the boys wore suits.  The couples were drawn with  <br/>\nrejections on sibling draws or already-couples.  Some of the girls  <br/>\ngot together Thursday night and made corsages and boutonneires from  <br/>\nroses and greens they&#39;d bought at a flower shop.   They were going to  <br/>\none of the boys&#39; parents&#39; house for photos, then to an Italian  <br/>\nrestaurant, then back to the house to dance and swim.   They&#39;re all  <br/>\nstill asleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf that group, five were unschoolers, and the rest &quot;school kids,&quot; but  <br/>\ntheatre and gaming and fantasy kids mostly.  Holly says lots of them  <br/>\nare easily discouraged about their creative bursts by other kids  <br/>\nsaying &quot;dumb,&quot; but not as bad as most groups she&#39;s been around.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point of this story was going to be this:  Beth, the organizer,  <br/>\nwho is a regular in local theatre stuff, came into my den when she  <br/>\ncame to pick Holly up for flower arranging.  She said &quot;I LOVE this  <br/>\nroom!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy den is not my best room.  I had been making costumes for weeks,  <br/>\nand never cleaned up after it.  There was laundry all over the couch,  <br/>\nand baskets of sorted laundry various places on the floor.  There&#39;s a  <br/>\nshelf of DVD&#39;s and tapes nearly as big as a wall, and books about  <br/>\nmovies and TV shows there.  There&#39;s another shelf of games, with  <br/>\nstuffed monkeys (dusty stuffed monkeys) on the top.  The ironing  <br/>\nboard was up with piles of ironed napkins and sewing supplies on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut she loves that room.   And here&#39;s one reason why:  I asked what  <br/>\nsupplies they had, and she said she got florists&#39; tape and roses and  <br/>\ngreens.  I said &quot;Are you using wires?&quot;  She looked blank, so I opened  <br/>\na drawer, in that room, and pulled out a pack of florists&#39; wire and  <br/>\nhanded it to her.  I said maybe they&#39;re using something else more  <br/>\nhigh-tech these days; if so, bring these back and let me know what  <br/>\nthe deal is (because one of the girls had worked for a florist).<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly said the next day that the florist girl was embarrassed and  <br/>\nworried because she hadn&#39;t said &quot;and buy wire,&quot; and Beth was happy to  <br/>\nbe able to hand the wires over, and say to Holly several times that  <br/>\nnight &quot;I&#39;m so glad your mom gave us wire!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy house is cluttered, but I had florist&#39;s wire in the room where  <br/>\nsomeone mentioned flower arranging.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other extreme of that is a house so sterile that there is nothing  <br/>\nwith which to create or from which to learn.  Holly had a best  <br/>\nfriend, when she was four and five and six.  The girl LOVED to come  <br/>\nacross the street to our house, and she loved to paint.  We had all  <br/>\nkinds of paints and paper, and she did different kinds of painting  <br/>\ndifferent days, and sometimes would come in the door saying &quot;Can I  <br/>\npaint?&quot;   For her birthday we gave her a how-to-paint book with the  <br/>\nwater colors built into it, and pages right there to paint on, all  <br/>\nself-contained, with a storage space for the brush.  Her mother was  <br/>\nNOT happy at all.  She said she didn&#39;t want her painting in the  <br/>\nhouse, that she could paint at school.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaint at school!?  Not for many years, and even then, once a week  <br/>\n*maybe* unless one was in an art class in high school, and even then,  <br/>\npainting would only be one small part of the years&#39; media experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my house is going to be a school too, I want it to be a GREAT  <br/>\nschool where kids can paint every day if they want to.  I want it to  <br/>\nbe the best school, where there are things to discover and use  <br/>\nindependently or share or take outside into the sunlight and rain  <br/>\n(not musical instruments, but most other things), and I want a  <br/>\nmicroscope, but they take room.  And I want adult-reading-level pop- <br/>\nup books about physics and Egypt, but they take room.  And I want  <br/>\nLOTS of recorded music and movies and books, but they do certainly  <br/>\nand absolutely take a lot of room.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] housekeeping, eating, and unschooling","postDate":"1180870091","msgId":28994,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ0M0U3NEZBLUM5MkQtNENERS04MDYzLTkwQjE2QzA5NDI5NEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ2NjFENEMyLjkwNDAzMDdAc2l4cmVkaGVhZHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PEMyODcxREZCLjhCRTk1JWttY2tlcm5hbkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0PiA8NDY2MUQ0QzIuOTA0MDMwN0BzaXhyZWRoZWFkcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":28992,"nextInTopic":28997,"prevInTime":28993,"nextInTime":28995,"topicId":28971,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

There is a big difference  <br/>\nin attitude between slothfulness versus choosing to lower the  <br/>\npriorities of housecleaning, cooking from scratch, eating off nice  <br/>\ndishes, and so on, in order to spend your time and energy in other ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople have different kinds of intelligences, ala Howard Gardner. I  <br/>\nthink some kind of space and time &quot;orderliness&quot; might be one of the  <br/>\nso-far undefined ones. I don&#39;t have much natural &quot;orderliness&quot;  <br/>\nintelligence and had to learn and practice it over years. By the time  <br/>\nI figured out how to do some of what relatively neat people seem to  <br/>\ndo naturally, my kids were in their teens and my house was way  <br/>\noverloaded and disorganized.  In place of &quot;orderliness,&quot; I have  <br/>\ntremendous energy, enthusiasm, and multi-tasking abilities, plus  <br/>\nflexibility and tolerance and appreciation of a lot of swirling chaos  <br/>\naround me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my family, the very same way of &quot;being&quot; that left my house  <br/>\noverloaded and disorganized was what made our unschooling lives  <br/>\nendlessly exciting and rich with much variety of experience. I was  <br/>\nthe epitome of the &quot;side-tracked home executive,&quot; but another way to  <br/>\nsee it would be that I was the person who was always following some  <br/>\nside track to make new discoveries and connections and it was all  <br/>\nthose side tracks that created the rich texture of our lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother point of view: I am an economist and our mantra is, of  <br/>\ncourse, &quot;There is no such thing as a free lunch.&quot; This means that  <br/>\nevery time you make a choice, you give up something else - the next- <br/>\nbest alternative is the cost of what you do choose. If you choose to  <br/>\nspend time cooking dinner, from scratch, that is time you are not  <br/>\nspending playing Monopoly with a child or holding the hose while the  <br/>\nchildren run through the water or snuggling up on the couch to watch  <br/>\nyet another episode of Sponge Bob. This is a fact of life - when you  <br/>\nchoose vacuuming, you&#39;re &quot;not choosing&quot; something else and that  <br/>\n&quot;something else&quot; could have been time connecting with a child. There  <br/>\nis always a cost. Always something else you could have done, instead,  <br/>\nalways a next-best alternative. What we were suggesting was to take a  <br/>\nrealistic look at the cost of trying to keep the house very clean,  <br/>\neat off real dishes, cook from scratch - what is being given up? Make  <br/>\na choice based on what has the most value to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point isn&#39;t so much to relieve guilt as to relieve exhaustion and  <br/>\nsupport unschooling, which requires that parents mostly put  <br/>\nchildren&#39;s needs and interests at the top of their priorities.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I already tried to clarify what I meant by the words<br/>\n&gt; &quot;supposed  unschooling lifestyle&quot; in another post.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I understood you to mean that other people think that the unschooling  <br/>\nlifestyle is necessarily one of slothfulness, but you disagree,  <br/>\nthinking that people can unschool and still keep their house clean  <br/>\nand orderly and cook all meals from scratch.

My point was that I often feel like a weirdo for being neat and <br/>\norganized AND an unschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;How many children do you have? Do you all think the same way? I ask because<br/>\nyou have strong ideas and say &quot;we&quot; for them.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have 5, 4 surviving. They are 11-2. I had the first 3 in 3 years and <br/>\nour 4th also had critical medical issues. I say that to say I know what <br/>\n&quot;busy&quot; is. Even now, we suburban homestead, I run a business, and am <br/>\nwriting a book. I could never, ever do all this if I had to do a canned <br/>\ncurriculum. I do indeed have strong ideas and one of them is to hike my <br/>\nown hike. I want a clean house so I clean the house. Our kids don&#39;t have <br/>\nassigned chores but I do ask them to help with stuff through the day. I <br/>\nshould qualify that because at our house, a question is a question if <br/>\none can answer &quot;no&quot; and it be okay. If I ask, they can say no and often <br/>\ndo! We talk a lot about being a team (everyone makes the mess, everyone <br/>\ncleans the mess) and are admittedly raising them with the idea of being <br/>\nresponsible for their own mess. But that also looks different for <br/>\neveryone. The little one, for instance, isn&#39;t responsible a bit ;-). And <br/>\nmy oldest two are very different: one is a neatnic and the other is a <br/>\nfree spirit. She helps with communal spaces but her own space is her own <br/>\nspace.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Us too. Are you associating messy house when kids are very young with<br/>\ndirtiness in general?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOh gee...if I am, then I&#39;m in trouble! :-) No. There is a difference <br/>\nbetween what I call &quot;the signs of life&quot; and filth.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot; You say &quot;see a pattern here&quot; as if these are the<br/>\n&quot;shoulds&quot; of life. Are you unschooling, or do you have an &quot;unschooling<br/>\nemphasis&quot;? I think there is probably a difference.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAh. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Not that size is important, but your mention of &quot;chubby&quot; along with<br/>\ntv-watchin&#39; and gaming doesn&#39;t fit us. I go to a gym everyday. Every member<br/>\nof my family is thin. Three of my kids are active in a different physical<br/>\nactivity regularly. The other is still thin. I don&#39;t think these images you<br/>\nhave created in your thinking are very helpful for unschooling. If &quot;clean&quot;<br/>\nliving is important to you, and you have made that a priority, and it is<br/>\nworking for you. But it certainly isn&#39;t an end-all, in my opinion.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, it&#39;s not an end-all. Just a part of my life.

I write for a variety of clients, edit a magazine for a<br/>\nnonprofit and do rather time-consuming volunteer work for that same<br/>\nnonprofit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s just what I do. I also talk to the kids *a lot,* take them all sorts of<br/>\nplaces, read them all kinds of things, help them find things they&#39;d like to<br/>\nread, help them find movies they&#39;d like to watch, supervise them while<br/>\nthey&#39;re swimming (or swim with them). I don&#39;t feel guilty for the time I<br/>\nspend on my business or my volunteer work because their needs are met.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, frequently, my for-pay and volunteer work has advantages for them.<br/>\nThey have friends they&#39;ve met through my volunteer work, and some of my work<br/>\npays rather well. So, when I have a lucrative assignment, the older ones<br/>\nknow it means good things for them. The younger ones don&#39;t understand -- but<br/>\nas a business owner, I have a lot of flexibility. My older children are<br/>\ninterested in my work (both for-pay and volunteer), and they hear about what<br/>\nI&#39;m doing and ask questions about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also do a lot of my work before they wake up or once they&#39;re asleep (right<br/>\nnow, it&#39;s mostly before they wake up, since they&#39;re on a late-to-bed,<br/>\nlate-to-rise schedule right now. I do work while they&#39;re awake, but in my<br/>\nfamily it&#39;s just like housework -- I can stop and start as needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t do a lot of things that some people consider mandatory. I don&#39;t do<br/>\nfull makeup every morning or blow-dry or straighten or curl my hair. My<br/>\nhouse isn&#39;t immaculate. I don&#39;t cook fancy meals.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also am pretty passionate about being with my kids, and that&#39;s more<br/>\nimportant to me than my work -- even though I&#39;m passionate about that, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathleen <br/>\nin Riverside</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29001,"nextTopicId":29031}}
