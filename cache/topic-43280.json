Slept under the stars on a navajo reservation with stray dogs snuggled up on our sleeping bags. We had a loose overall plan, and added or subtracted time depending on how much we liked certain places. (If horseback riding was available, that automatically added time--girls would have been happy RIDING cross country!) and we spent a lot of time with local animals. ie at mount rushmore, we spent maybe 1 hour at the monument, and an entire day looking at prairie dogs and buffalo.

It&#39;s hard to say, because you didn&#39;t say &lt;g&gt;, whether all this activity is at the request of your daughters or not.  I&#39;ve found that my kids--even my very social one--just don&#39;t want all of this running around.  Our deschooling process looked so much more relaxed.  And it also included day long playdates where the mom and I would visit and there was lots of time.  It may not look like that for your family, but if you traded school busyness for other-life busyness, they may not really know the difference.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the true gifts that unschooling has to offer is time and space for breathing, daydreaming, two hour baths in the middle of the day, impromptu teaparties, or just hanging around and seeing what comes up.  And maybe some long, slow playdates with one or two friends at a time with lots of time to make deep connections.  Of course it&#39;s hard to get a picture in a short post, but both of your posts have felt a little whirlwindish with activities.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRhetorical question coming:  Is that what your girls really want, or are you thinking they should have all of those activities?  Because there is SOMETHING that isn&#39;t working for them--is it too much activity or too little meaningful connection with friends or with you?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd even if they are truly asking for all of those activities, are they truly being served by them all at the same time?  Maybe choose the most important one or two and then rotate them--just a thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: back to school...","postDate":"1237775080","msgId":43294,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA5NzlCODM3LTA4OTYtNEQ1MS04MjI3LTIxN0FFMzFDNjdCREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDg5OTAyNi43OTk3NS5xbUB3ZWI1MzYxMi5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDg5OTAyNi43OTk3NS5xbUB3ZWI1MzYxMi5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":43293,"nextInTopic":43295,"prevInTime":43293,"nextInTime":43295,"topicId":43280,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-...it s the process of recovering from the mindset and expectations of school.

Re the question, when did we &quot;deschool&quot;, from what I&#39;ve read, I think that&#39;s the process of recovering from the mindset and expectations of school.

Hence the outdoor program. We have also acquired geckos, (in addition to dogs, cats, fish, parrots and horses) and will be adding baby chicks and a beehive in May. They can name practically every breed of horse and dog, and where they originated. We watch dog and horse shows whenever we can. Are leaving tomorrow for san diego zoo. Have been whale watching once, (monterey, ca) and will go up to washington state at some point to see the resident orcas which they are very interested in.<br/>\n     They love music, and requested the string and piano lessons, and also love musicals and theater, so we do quite a bit of that, they act out plays with their stuffed animals, and make up songs. <br/>\n      I&#39;m thinking after reading suggestions, that maybe she is a sort of child that can fall more easily into negative thinking, and maybe I should try to limit time with schoolchildren and focus heavily on developing unschooling relationships. There is a group in  san francisco that looks pretty active, from their website anyway.

From a parent&#39;s<br/>\nperspective, a year may not be a long time to be homeschooling OR going to<br/>\nschool, but for some people it feels like FOREVER.  I remember how bored I<br/>\ngot and how grateful I was to see *any* change from the norm.  I&#39;m still<br/>\nthat way.  Sameness for too long just kills me.  No matter how much I like<br/>\nwhere I am.  It&#39;s hard to explain.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like possibly your &quot;unhappy&quot; daughter is one who craves newness<br/>\nand change.  Perhaps there are creative ways to accommodate more newness,<br/>\nperhaps even daily or more often than that, into your very busy lives.<br/>\nSwitch tracks every now and again.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if you can&#39;t get to a conference, maybe you could go to a local<br/>\nunschooling meetup and strike up some conversation with parents of some<br/>\nunschoolers your child/ren likes... and then call or email if your girls<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to go back to meetups just make plans on the spur of the moment<br/>\nto go see a movie or get ice cream or pizza.  Or set up something at home<br/>\nand invite local unschoolers over for oh any reason... It&#39;s Spring!.  (I<br/>\nhope to do this in the not too distant future myself... it&#39;s been so crazy<br/>\naround here.)  It doesn&#39;t have to be about meetups.<br/>\n<br/>\nI run into lotsa people who prefer sameness more than I do, and I long to<br/>\nhop off somewhere else.  I went to some local pond/fountains and ducks with<br/>\nKarl ... something a lot of people do everyday but it&#39;s not a regular thing<br/>\nfor me.  I go to children&#39;s museums but not regularly.  I *do* go to the<br/>\nlibrary a lot, and other than librarians I don&#39;t run into the same people<br/>\nwhen I do.  Karl seems to like that too at least for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nBuilding a social life takes me a while but I have some really great friends<br/>\nfrom my hopping around ways.

You may need to help her paint a picture  <br/>\nin her mind of what going back to school looks like and remind her of  <br/>\nthe parts of it that were making her unhappy before.  Helping her find  <br/>\nhappiness and friends and work she enjoys etc.  may take some time and  <br/>\nshe may just not realize that it is a process that she has some  <br/>\ncontrol over.

We live in a town that is centered around the schools, and all the kids on the street (a lot!) that she plays with are in school. Short of moving or forbidding her to play with the neighbors, i can&#39;t avoid that influence. And I go to quite a bit of trouble to have them around other homeschooled kids--an all day homeschool outdoor program once a week, and almost daily visits to our barn (an hour drive round trip)  where they play with another family of homeschoolers who have a horse.  Regular field trips to meet new homeschoolers, pony club events, etc.  (plus girl scouts--their old troop from school days--but they didn&#39;t want to leave it) Not to mention music lessons for two instruments each--I feel like we have almost too many activities, leaving little time to just relax! Hopefully, joining a play group with a larger number of kids will quell her desire to return to school.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":294520986,"authorName":"Joanna Murphy","from":"&quot;Joanna Murphy&quot; &lt;ridingmom@...&gt;","profile":"ridingmom1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: back to school...","postDate":"1237741682","msgId":43284,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdxNXI5aSs1anNvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdxNGk1bStwaHZtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43281,"nextInTopic":43286,"prevInTime":43283,"nextInTime":43285,"topicId":43280,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It s been my experience that when kids have gone to school, come home and then not hooked into a social group apart from school, is when they can end up","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1250369126\">It&#39;s been my experience that when kids have gone to school, come home and then not hooked into a social group apart from school, is when they can end up wanting to go back.

I pulled them both out of school almost exactly a year ago, near the end of second grade, because they were so unhappy in school, and I was unhappy with school as well. We have loved homeschooling, and almost immediately fell into unschooling. It felt quite natural to me, and certainly enriched our lives. The problem is that one of the girls--incidentally the one who was most unhappy at school--is saying she wants to return to school because she misses her friends. We have two former classmates that live on the street that we play with regularly, and I try to organize playdates with a few other girls as well. We also belong to brownies, so they see friends there, and pony club, where they have a second set of friends. I&#39;m also planning to join a local unschooling group (had gone once before, and had a nice time, but didn&#39;t go back mainly because we&#39;re so busy doing things and going places, and the girls didn&#39;t seem all that gung ho to return)<br/>\n     Has anyone else had a child requesting a return to school and if so how did you deal with it?
