Some people listen better when they don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; look into someone&#39;s eyes. There are different ways of doing most<br/>\n&gt; anything and trying to push eye contact may be unhelpful for some.-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Right.  She&#39;s very right.  Too much eye contact is hostile primate<br/>\n&gt; behavior.  Don&#39;t go against instincts when you don&#39;t have to!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I was in an anatomy for bodyworkers class this weekend, and the<br/>\ninstructor is a somatic psychotherapist. He was talking about eye<br/>\ncontact, and how incredibly potent it is from a biochemical<br/>\nperspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nApparently, gazing into the eyes of another at the distance of a<br/>\nnursing baby from its mother (about 18&quot;, roughly) has the potential to<br/>\nrelease large amounts of oxytocin into the bloodstream,<br/>\ncreating/facilitati ng bonding between two people on an emotional<br/>\nlevel. Thus, he explained, it&#39;s *extremely* important that if you&#39;re<br/>\ngoing to engage in eye contact at that general range, you need to make<br/>\nsure your intent is loving and connecting and no other thing, because<br/>\nit &quot;screws with the hormonal soup&quot; otherwise, and that&#39;s part of why<br/>\neye contact with the intent to manipulate or intimidate is so<br/>\nincredibly upsetting. On a biochemical level, it&#39;s wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe suggested that for conversations involving two people but not that<br/>\nlevel of deep contact, it&#39;s often far better to be facing the same<br/>\nway, shoulder to shoulder (which is why talking on walks or during<br/>\ndrives is often really good), because there isn&#39;t the same level of<br/>\nhormonal involvement that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW, YMMV,<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~L!<br/>\n<br/>\ns/v Excellent Adventure<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theexcel\">http://www.theexcel</a> lentadventure. com/<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52107,"nextTopicId":52128}}
