But sadly, it can  be the <br/>\ntruth!  If I&#39;m in a horrible mood, and not watching myself or my  attitude, if <br/>\nI&#39;m having a pity party, the rest of the house CAN be  miserable.  I think it&#39;s <br/>\nthe &quot;reason&quot; for mama not being happy that you  have to examine. <br/>\n <br/>\nIs it because we&#39;re listening to those voices saying, &quot;You have to be happy  <br/>\nfirst&quot; or &quot;You deserve more than this&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m the only one that cares about  <br/>\nthis house!  Grrrr!!!&quot;  If we can recognize that we&#39;re listening to  those <br/>\nvoices instead of looking at why we&#39;re really feeling down we can nip it  early.  <br/>\nThat helps me a lot.

Eat a  bananna.
