Been too busy to participate (I work as a cook in a candy shop and December is insanely busy), but wanted to send an intro and say how much I appreciate this list when I have had time to read some.<br/>\n<br/>\nHusband and I have a son, Jorgen, 12, daughter, Grethe, 10, and daughter, Solvij, 7. We live in a pretty small town in coastal northern California (about 1400 people). Kids have never been to school and we are unschoolers. Although I have had some brain farts about math along the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeems like there used to be more unschoolers around here in years past, but now we mostly encounter c-uh-rriculum-lovers. An example. We were at a craft/board game/social day gathering for homeschoolers this month. A woman was telling that some reading teacher in our area has designed a curriculum to teach any kid to read and would like make a free presentation to homeschoolers (you prolly know the drill on this). Then she asked some of us what materials we like to use to teach our kids to read. When she asked me, I asked if my daughter would share how she learned to read. She explained how we read to her, she looked at books and magazines she liked, asked questions, figured out words, etc. After she spoke, there was silence. Complete and utter silence. Until someone changed the subject. Sometimes I feel like a freak! Which is not necessarily a bad thing...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for being here,<br/>\nAnn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1818,"nextTopicId":1894}}
