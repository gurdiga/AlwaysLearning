Some were rather elaborate and included vocalizations and sounds in the back of his throat. (He also wet the bed the entire time, which I learned sometimes goes hand-in-hand with tic behaviors.) In the beginning, we were very worried and certain that he had Tourette&#39;s or some kind of tic disorder. Thankfully his doctor reassured us that it was fairly common and advised us to take a wait-and-see attitude. He suggested that we completely ignore the tics; he felt that calling attention to them would make the problem worse. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the years, we saw the tics come and go in cycles. Just when a particular one was fading, another one would crop up. They were definitely more pronounced in times of stress, and most noticeable if he was idly doing something like watching tv. They would disappear completely if he was absorbed in something like playing his guitar or a video game. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, they gradually faded and completely disappeared by the time he was 16 or so (as did the bedwetting). I know that seems a long time to wait if your child is only 5! I know other children whose tic behaviors lasted a much shorter time than Cody&#39;s. I just wanted to reassure you that it&#39;s very common and that most cases simply fade away in time if you don&#39;t call attention to it. Don&#39;t worry! :) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDenise <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.smartingusup.blogspot.com <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;mdfisher23&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mfisher@...\">mfisher@...</a>&gt; <br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Thursday, May 21, 2009 8:00:58 PM GMT -05:00 US/Canada Eastern <br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] 5 yr old son has started twitching <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son just turned 5 and I&#39;ve noticed over the past three weeks that he has been twitching and shrugging his shoulders a lot at different times.

When I read to him he does it alot, and also when he&#39;s on the computer.  Other times it just seems random.  He says he can&#39;t control it, and is not bothered by it nor in pain.  I think my hubby and I are more bothered or - worried is a better word.  He will be seeing his dr. for a checkup in a couple of weeks and I plan to bring it up to her, but I thought I&#39;d ask the list to see if anyone had any thoughts or similar experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you!<br/>\nMarcia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45473,"nextTopicId":16173}}
