It actually was fun (tongue twisters were my favorite) and I felt good about it.&nbsp;I still use some of the exercises I learned then as vocal warmups&nbsp;when I have an acting job.&nbsp;&nbsp;The confidence I gained in speaking probably influenced my career choice. &nbsp;I teach the same exercises&nbsp;to aspiring actors as well, since&nbsp;vocal flexibility&nbsp;is a vital part of the art&nbsp;and can make a difference in whether or not you get the gig!&nbsp; When I am tired, my mouth goes back to doing it the old way.&nbsp; My daughter notices when I am reading to her late at night and pokes me:-) So I was a&nbsp;motivated learner and enjoyed the learning environment.&nbsp; I do not know if I would have &quot;grown out of it.&quot;&nbsp; </div>\n\n    \n<div><br>\n</div>\n\n    \n<div>If it&#39;s important to your son, he can probably do it when he wants to (like my teenage acting students do). A speech therapist might&nbsp;know if there&nbsp;are physiological challenges that are more easily met at certain ages. I&#39;m an actress, not a doctor.&nbsp;If my daughter (6.99 yrs)&nbsp;were to want to do something regarding a speech pattern then I would&nbsp;find someone else to help her in a specific setting and otherwise not point it out to her.&nbsp; As it is, she has an interesting habit of repeating ends of words or parts of sentences as she is building her thoughts as she speaks (that&#39;s my impression of what/why she is speaking this way).&nbsp; I just make sure to give her all the time she needs to finish what she is trying to say. You probably know how irritating it is to have someone finish your sentences for you!&nbsp; If I really didn&#39;t get what she said, I&#39;ll ask a clarifying question like &quot;Are you saying&nbsp;Pinkie Pie forgot where she put the party cannons?&quot; rather than &quot;What?&quot;&nbsp; Which I think models more communication ski lls.</div>\n\n    \n<div><br>\n</div>\n\n

The Ls in other words slowly filtered in. <br/>\nAs with all learning, motivation was the key. <br/>\nWhat is your son&#39;s motivation?  Does he want you to point out when he&#39;s mispronouncing something even if you can understand?  Are there a few words to start with that would be most helpful, and then the concept can spread out across his language naturally?<br/>\nI like the idea of recording his voice so he can hear what others hear, and if he wants he could hear his progress as he practices. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ncheri</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128961575,"authorName":"Vicki Dennis","from":"Vicki Dennis &lt;vicki@...&gt;","profile":"vickitexan2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] 7 year-old with speech, pronunciation difficulties","postDate":"1431387964","msgId":75890,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBTVN1N053VkFlRXlYQ1JVMkErMHV0K1JUZVBtdjVSbUZHbjFoZWpOcUU4aHdnSlkwQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG1pcXZyMCs1bzNybW5AWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PG1pcXZyMCs1bzNybW5AWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":75889,"nextInTopic":75891,"prevInTime":75889,"nextInTime":75891,"topicId":75889,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Look for ways that he can actually hear what others hear.
