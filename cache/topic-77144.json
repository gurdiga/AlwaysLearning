I am asking for ideas to help me better partner my 16 year old son, my oldest child, who has never been to school. My thinking has become unclear and my son seems too be holding himself back. We are in the UK and began with what is called autonomous education here when my first child was small. Our parenting looked a lot like unschooling in many respects, though there were some limits around sugary food (my own anxieties with food&nbsp;since childhood), which we stopped around three years ago, coinciding with me starting to read on here. This group has really helped me in subtle and wonderful ways to focus more on joy and connection in my relationships.</span></p><p class=\"ygrps-yiv-184862447p2\"><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-184862447s1\"></span><br></p><p class=\"ygrps-yiv-184862447p1\"><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-184862447s1\">My 16 year old has never been much of communicator so i have always checked in often to find out what he needs. His life so far has been as full and as rich as i think he has wanted. These last few months though, i have become concerned that he is holding himself back from things he could try because of fear. He is a shy person who has always found unfamiliar situations and group social occasions hard, though he can be great fun at home and one-to-one. He is also an introvert who needs a lot of time to himself, and i suspect he may be a little bit Aspergers too (i know they don’t use that term in diagnosis now). He likes the idea of a part-time job, but is worried in case he can’t do it, or the social interactions will be too difficult. He has been offered the chance to join a tutor group for maths and English with a group of teen friends, which he sees could be good stepping stone to some jobs and courses he may want to do later, but is worried he will struggle in the group. He is aware that some of his peers are going to college and some are studying for exams at home, and because those things are new and different and scary he doesn&#39;t want to consider them. It isn&#39;t that i think he should or must do these things at all.

If he were a 10 year old who enjoyed spending his time watching technology shows, and dungeons and dragons videos on you tube, gaming online, and inlining at skateparks i know i would be happy he was happy and not worry.

Work on helping to stop and hear “always” or “never.”  They’re rarely stating a truth.<br/>\n<br/>\nDidn’t you hope he would grow up?<br/>\nIs it possible that you, the mom, fear his changing from boy to man?<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as comparisons go, the best one might be to compare what he knows and is doing to what he might be doing if he were in school.  MANY boys that age want to drop out. They get involved in dangerous activities of one sort or another, with groups of other boys.  They can become belligerant in school, and defiant.  If he’s not doing all of that, then he might be still at an advantage.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf before he’s been eager to go out, maybe he’s at an age where he sees the disadvantages.  Maybe his skin is embarrassing him, or maybe he’s feeling gangly and too old for boys’ things, and too young for men’s things.  Maybe he’s right!  Maybe it’s a good time for him to cocoon himself and wait until he wants to venture out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":221591978,"authorName":"Bernadette Lynn","from":"Bernadette Lynn &lt;bernadette.lynn@...&gt;","profile":"bwalyalynn","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Shyness and fears","postDate":"1464974156","msgId":77146,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBTTZBM04xYTBmYm5abTFHczdTRE5aUExOVC1wSDF2NGh5NXZieCtjSFoxUDVMV0oyZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG5pcmcyNysxYm8xbmFpQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG5pcmcyNysxYm8xbmFpQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":77144,"nextInTopic":77148,"prevInTime":77145,"nextInTime":77147,"topicId":77144,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ++++++++++++++++++++++++++ None of those things sound particularly fun or interesting to me, nor would they to my girls.
