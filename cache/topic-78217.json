I hope even those in other countries, though, can get some ideas or encouragement from some of these articles.   <br/>\n <br/>\nThe organization is expanding into learning about relationships, and I thought it cold be good to know.  For those outside the U.S.  <br/>\n<br/>\n4-H Is Helping Kids Plant The Seeds For Healthy Relationships<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the NPR (National Public Radio) article:  <br/>\n________<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Conflict is pervasive when teens have romantic relationships,&quot; says Giordano. She finds that when young people are given the right tools, they have the ability to identify unhealthy relationship signs as they mature.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis 4-H program has been around for about a year. In that time, Chan says the majority of participants report feeling more confident after the workshop was over and that they felt they could share their relationship needs with their partners.<br/>\n____________<br/>\n<br/>\nIt’s an interesting piece, and it’s possible that there will be materials available online.
