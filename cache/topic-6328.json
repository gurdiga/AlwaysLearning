Graduate at 18, go to <br/>\ncollege, get a job....BLAH!!<br/>\nThere are no rules.<br/>\nA person should follow their heart, follow their interests and let that lead <br/>\nthem to work they will love.

Quit expecting.<br/>\nThis comes from someone that has had/is still having some of the same <br/>\nstruggles you are.
