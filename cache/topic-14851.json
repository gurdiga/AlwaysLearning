Keith/dh has been involved in the discussions.  He downloaded (or whatever) <br/>\nand printed out the music from where she deposited it online, and played <br/>\nthrough it all.  It was fun hearing him play from the other room, just long <br/>\nstretches of him sight reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nVarious people have volunteered info on what instruments they can play, and <br/>\nthe organizational meeting is coming up.  There&#39;s been a discussion on the list <br/>\nwith someone who plays two middle eastern instruments and wants to see if <br/>\nthey&#39;ll fit in at all...    Here&#39;s a paragraph, and then the effect some fairly <br/>\ninnocuous little thing had on me.  See if you can guess what made me twitch! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Sounds like fun.  I will come on Sunday, June 8 and we will see what<br/>\n<br/>\nhappens.  I can read music but very slowly.  I am better at improvisation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know much about western music theory though.  My training is Middle<br/>\n<br/>\nEastern.  I can be taught, however.
