At  <br/>\nfirst I was really embarrassed that it was actually &quot;in vinyl&quot; and on  <br/>\nsome cars and credited to me, but as the years have gone by my  <br/>\nembarrassment has dissolved, because in those eight or nine years, how  <br/>\nmany tens or hundreds of thousands of non-readers have been created by  <br/>\nschools?
