If everyone is feeling like he or she has enough, issues of fairness drop by the wayside - so focus on whether or not kids are getting enough of what they want, and looking for ways to help them feel &quot;full&quot;.

Over the last few weeks I&#39;ve been trying to adopt unschooling principles, slowly, and trying to say yes more in previously restricted areas like food and tv. In the main, I&#39;m really appreciating the more relaxed atmosphere and not battling my kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m getting it quite right yet. A system has evolved for watching tv: one child asks for it on, they all sit down and take turns in choosing what to watch (Netflix, DVDs etc - no live channels due to finances). <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not quite as harmonious as I would like! There are arguments over whose turn it is (my son, 6, gets very upset if he doesn&#39;t get to pick first), and no one wants to stop watching until each child has had an equal number of picks.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this just because TV is still a novelty, having been restricted before (it used to only go on at 4pm ish when I would make tea)? Or am I approching it wrong, trying to make it fair and equal what they get to watch?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m reading &quot;Winning Parent Winning Child&quot; by Jan Fortune, a UK radical unschooler, and she writes &quot;the notion of fairness promotes a climate of sibling rivalry in which children are constantly watching one another and their parents for signals of unfairness or favour...
