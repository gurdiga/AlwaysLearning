I don&#39;t post much <br/>\nat all, but I am starting to feel like I just don&#39;t get unschooling. <br/>\nIn theory, yes it makes total sense to me. And, the thought of <br/>\nsending my kids to school just doesn&#39;t make sense to me. (And the <br/>\nfact that they don&#39;t want to). My problem is that I read about all <br/>\nof these cool, fun things that other people do, and I just don&#39;t see <br/>\nthat happening for us. I have all of these ideas in my head, but <br/>\nseem to have a hard time bringing them to fruition. I feel like a <br/>\ndeadbeat. I am not writing this to get sympathy, I know that is not <br/>\nwhat this list is all about.  I am getting some help for anxiety, so <br/>\nthat is part of my problem. I am overwelmed with &quot;should be&#39;s&quot;, <br/>\nwhich leads to anxiety,which leads to me doing nothing. Maybe I need <br/>\nto be de-schooled more?! I think if someone told me what to do with <br/>\nthe kids each day, I could do it. I know unschooling isn&#39;t like this <br/>\nthough. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are watching too much tv right now because they are bored. I <br/>\nhave read so many books and articles and it all makes complete <br/>\nsense. It is putting these things into real life that I don&#39;t get. <br/>\nMy kids don&#39;t have these cool projects going on. They do play <br/>\noutside alot, and with some neighbor kids, and they are each taking <br/>\na class (gymnastics and trampoline). It just doesn&#39;t feel &quot;right&quot; to <br/>\nme. I am trying to be more present, which is a big problem for me. I <br/>\ntend to escape in reading, I am working on this. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you read?  Could you read outloud to your kids, even small sections<br/>\nor a few paragraphs from what your reading and then discuss it a little...I<br/>\nused to think I had to read the whole thing, cover to cover, to my kids, but<br/>\nhave since seen that I can read them pieces of things and have great<br/>\nconversations, whatever I am reading....also, we discovered we love to<br/>\nlisten to certain books on tape together...we get them mostly at the<br/>\nLibray...I have boys, age 11 and 15...they loved Eragon (written by a<br/>\nhomeschoolers)..on tape available at Target, and we&#39;ve loved the Artemis<br/>\nFowl series, all on tape and available at the public library.  It worked<br/>\nbecause it combined my passion for reading with their interests.  (I love to<br/>\nread and &quot;escape&quot; into reading lots too...what&#39;s wrong with that...should be<br/>\nsure and put your book down when it doesn&#39;t feel right and find something to<br/>\ndo with the kids)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother problem is <br/>\nthat I don&#39;t feel like I have interesting things going on in my <br/>\nlife. The worst part is that I can&#39;t really think of anything that <br/>\nsounds interesting to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs this all the time or is it just when you are feeling down...it could be<br/>\nthat you are in a dark time in your life...which is part of life and<br/>\npossibly part of unschooling...(I went through a dark night of the<br/>\nsoul...read the book  &quot;Dark Nights of the Soul&quot; by Thomas Moore.  Really<br/>\nhelped me be O.K. with it.  Making yourself wrong for the way your life is<br/>\nwill only get you further into the muck.  On the other hand, you do need to<br/>\nlisten to that still, quiet voice, and take what steps you need to find your<br/>\nway back home.  I did some work with an organization called the Landmark<br/>\nEducation Corporation and the Landmark Forum...they have a website, if<br/>\nyou&#39;re interested.  That helped, too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what I am asking for. Maybe others that have been in <br/>\nthis place? I don&#39;t know. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust to let you know...yes, others have been in this place...namely me.<br/>\nThat would make two of us.  &quot;I&#39;m nobody, who are you.  Are you nobody two?<br/>\nThere&#39;s the two of us.&quot;  Emily Dickinson&#39;s beautiful poem...poetry is good<br/>\nstuff to read and talk about with your kids.  Also, works to talk to them<br/>\nabout your confusion. Kids are great listeners.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\nAmie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage 2 <br/>\n    From: &quot;Sandra Dodd&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a><br/>\n    Date: Tue May 2, 2006 10:26pm(PDT) <br/>\nSubject: Re: confused about unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On May 2, 2006, at 10:52 PM, mascire2 wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I think if someone told me what to do with<br/>\n&gt; the kids each day, I could do it.

I think<br/>\n&gt; even sugar is less of a hot topic than TV.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And it really cracks me up.  Because TV is like a<br/>\n&gt; godsend around here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My girls really like to wake up slowly watching TV.<br/>\n&gt; This is great for me because it gives me a chance to<br/>\n&gt; drink my espresso, read the paper (still looking for a<br/>\n&gt; dog), switch the laundry, maybe do a little pilates,<br/>\n&gt; and generally prepare for the day.  A moment to clean<br/>\n&gt; in the morning is great for me.  I feel ready to say<br/>\n&gt; lots of yeses when I&#39;m not saying, &quot;Let me just slick<br/>\n&gt; this up first.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; TV often offers us a moment to reconnect.  I can sit<br/>\n&gt; down with the girls and laugh out loud or ask what<br/>\n&gt; shows they like and why.  Many, many great<br/>\n&gt; conversations have happened because of this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We have the sit and spin and a mini tramp and puzzles<br/>\n&gt; and games and art projects and a computer and Lego&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; and baby dolls and magazines and books in the same<br/>\n&gt; room as one of our TVs...people rarely just sit<br/>\n&gt; passively and watch TV.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It offers siblings a chance to do something together.<br/>\n&gt; Or, it can get them apart!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lots of imaginative games and pretend play have ensued<br/>\n&gt; due to an idea gleaned from a television program.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;ve discovered new crafts, new recipes, art<br/>\n&gt; activities and science projects...all from TV.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Many new concepts have come to us via TV:  from<br/>\n&gt; beginning reading for my almost three year old to the<br/>\n&gt; study of physics and &quot;The Elegant Universe&quot; for<br/>\n&gt; myself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Half the music I like I found from watching TV and<br/>\n&gt; movies...either from soundtracks or music videos or<br/>\n&gt; musical guests or TV concerts.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My husband turns it on at bedtime for white noise.  He<br/>\n&gt; has to wake up earlier than us and this drowns out our<br/>\n&gt; sometimes loud sounds late at night.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; TV (I&#39;m thinking parody here) has given us many ways<br/>\n&gt; to laugh about situations that have the potential to<br/>\n&gt; make me cry.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The TV offers a connection to history and literature<br/>\n&gt; and language and culture and differing opinions and<br/>\n&gt; glimpses of remote parts of the world I will probably<br/>\n&gt; never see in person.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I like to watch shows from my childhood...it is a<br/>\n&gt; connection.  My kids learn more about me from what I<br/>\n&gt; watched and liked when I was younger.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;ve learned how to cook new foods.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My husband, a busy, busy man, will actually sit with<br/>\n&gt; us if we watch a show together, and he finds things<br/>\n&gt; for him and the girls to watch together.  Major<br/>\n&gt; bonding.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When my kids are in a &quot;TV phase&quot;, I like to look at it<br/>\n&gt; as a great opportunity for me to catch up on<br/>\n&gt; housework, phone calls, a new craft, or my sleep :).<br/>\n&gt; These don&#39;t last long so instead of worrying I take<br/>\n&gt; full advantage!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It really adds to our never-ending list of questions.<br/>\n&gt; The topics take us to the library and on field trips<br/>\n&gt; and into new artistic endeavors.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ooooh, and here&#39;s a really good one: TV topics are a<br/>\n&gt; great conversation link between my kids and schooled<br/>\n&gt; kids.  They can talk about favorite movies or shows or<br/>\n&gt; actors or musicians.  These topics are much better<br/>\n&gt; than, &quot;What grade are you in?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We have been introduced to so many fun games and toys<br/>\n&gt; because of the *gasp* advertisements.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It gives me a cozy, tucked-in, home-from-school<br/>\n&gt; feeling.  My kids don&#39;t really have that, but I&#39;m sure<br/>\n&gt; sometimes they get a nest-y cozy feeling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It connects us generationally.  My kids can talk to<br/>\n&gt; their grandparents about shows they mutually like and<br/>\n&gt; they can watch them together.  My grandparents don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; go to the skating rinks and sledding hills and zoos<br/>\n&gt; with us, but they can watch Mary Poppins with my kids<br/>\n&gt; and laugh and bond together.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My Mom had the TV on all the time.  She loved it.  But<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t remember her sitting and just watching very<br/>\n&gt; often. She crocheted and cooked and cleaned.  And she<br/>\n&gt; and I both read in front of the TV.  I read many a<br/>\n&gt; book in front of the TV just to be near her.  I did<br/>\n&gt; most of my homework in front of the TV (and did really<br/>\n&gt; well according to their standards).  And it still<br/>\n&gt; gives me a chance to knit and paint my toes and other<br/>\n&gt; things I like to do with some noise on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And guess what, even though I have these feelings of<br/>\n&gt; regard for the TV and tell my kids when their favorite<br/>\n&gt; shows are on and get them lots of movies and offer to<br/>\n&gt; go to lots of movies, they probably end up watching<br/>\n&gt; the same amount of TV as some kids with TV limits<br/>\n&gt; watch.  Because they *want* full lives and have many<br/>\n&gt; interests and love the outdoors and art and<br/>\n&gt; experiments and friends and going out to eat and well,<br/>\n&gt; you get the idea.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sarah Anderson-Thimmes<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Tired of spam?
