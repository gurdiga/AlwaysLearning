Fear and conditioning <br/>\nis a powerful force in our actions&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nThis is so true.....just recently I have begun to look at every reaction<br/>\nas coming from Love or Fear and it is amazing how all my negative<br/>\nreactions/no&#39;s are fear based..... My new method to control these<br/>\nimmediate reactions is to  try to stop the &quot;no&quot; or negative response<br/>\nbefore it escapes my lips and ask myself, &quot;why are you afraid/shutting<br/>\ndown/being closed minded, etc.&quot;  <br/>\nBy doing this I can usually laugh away the fear or figure out why I feel<br/>\nthe way I do and discuss it rather than just say &quot;no&quot;It really is<br/>\namazing how much is just conditioning and can be laughed away!<br/>\n <br/>\nFor instance, my 11 year old wants to have 6 of his buddies sleep<br/>\nover....I&#39;m tired, I have plans to get up early and go cycling the next<br/>\nday, my husband is out of town, blah, blah, blah...so I want to say no<br/>\nbecause I&#39;m afraid of them needing more than I can give, etc.  and in<br/>\nthe past, I would have given the &quot;no&quot; answer.....<br/>\nNow, instead I ask....&quot;why the no?&quot;  I discuss the above with my son and<br/>\nwe figure out ways to work through the above....he gets permission from<br/>\nhis friends  parents  for them to be here under my older son&#39;s<br/>\nsupervision  while I go on my ride( I was amazed that no parents cared<br/>\nthat I wouldn&#39;t be here for 2-3 hours:-) ), they&#39;ll let me get my sleep<br/>\nand wake me only for problems, they all agree to behave....you get the<br/>\npicture.....<br/>\nI can&#39;t believe how many times I have just said &quot;no&quot; to things without<br/>\nreally thinking and examining the reason for my &quot;no&quot;  I think it was<br/>\njust a bad habit that I learned from my parents and a response to<br/>\nirrational fears of losing control!<br/>\nI can&#39;t remember where I read it, but awhile ago I read that all<br/>\nactions, reactions, etc. are either results of feelings of  love or<br/>\nfear....<br/>\nIt really simplifies things when you begin to examine yourself and<br/>\nothers from this angle and it&#39;s kind of fun!<br/>\n <br/>\njudy chamberlain<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:judycha@...\">judycha@...</a><br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26009,"nextTopicId":26063}}
