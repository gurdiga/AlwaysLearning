They were always a variety of puzzles involving math (you <br/>\nare going to the store and want to buy some candy. Lemon drops are 2c each, <br/>\nbubble gum 3c each, caramels are 4c each, and chocolate drops are 5c each. <br/>\nYou have $2. What do you buy?), art (draw a dog using circles and triangles <br/>\ninstead of lines), language, etc. I would beg for problems, and he would sit <br/>\nin his chair with his lap board making up the several problems (always on <br/>\nwhite typing paper), then I would whisk off to my bedroom or other secret <br/>\nwork place with more typing paper to work on them. There was never any <br/>\npressure to finish them or to have a &quot;right&quot; answer, but I always tried to <br/>\nfinish them as quickly as possible, a race against myself sort of (of course, <br/>\nI always got bogged down in imagining things, as I&#39;m sure my dad well knew <br/>\nwould happen). As I got older, he included increasingly difficult concepts. <br/>\nHe was also big on making up treasure hunts for us kids, which I also adored <br/>\n(well, and still do ;^)<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are sort of like test taking. Maybe they will do?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad never believed in schools. He only believed in individuals. A shame <br/>\nthat my mom didn&#39;t listen to him more!<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nWynn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":552,"nextTopicId":578}}
