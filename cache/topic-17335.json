None of<br/>\nthis really applies in the case of neck injury, so I<br/>\ncould use a little advie/reassurance.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday afternoon my five year old came out from the<br/>\ncomputer with his head cocked to one side, crying and<br/>\nin pain.  At first we were thinking that it was just<br/>\none of those painfull &quot;pops&quot; or overextensions, or<br/>\nwhatever those are, which hurt intensely for a few<br/>\nmoments and then ease off.  But by evening he was<br/>\nstill crying when he tried to move his neck around,<br/>\neven after heat and ice, tylenol and rest.  He was<br/>\nsitting at the computer when he did this, just twisted<br/>\nit wrong or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been giving him tylenol to reduce inflamation<br/>\nand for pain, and icing the spot on his neck.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to take him to the doctor if they are just going<br/>\nto cause him pain and cost us money to tell us to have<br/>\nhim rest and take tylenol.  I read about pediatric<br/>\nneck injuries on the internet last night, and that&#39;s<br/>\nall they really said.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, he&#39;s not crying anymore, but he whines<br/>\nand complains when he tries to move his neck wrong, or<br/>\nwhen we have to move him.  He&#39;s been in our bed,<br/>\npropped up when he wants to eat or read, with a U<br/>\nshaped buckwheat hull pillow supporting his head. <br/>\nHe&#39;s eating and drinking fine, awake and active with<br/>\narms and legs, and annoyed at being stuck in bed, just<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have full rotation on his neck.  He can rotate<br/>\nfully to one side, and put his chin down, but not<br/>\ntouch his chin to his chest, and cannot tip his head<br/>\nback or towards the injured side.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe can walk, when he has to go to the bathroom or<br/>\nwants to eat at the table briefly, but it&#39;s hard for<br/>\nhim with his neck injury, and he wants to go lie down<br/>\nafterward.  He needs help sitting up and lying down to<br/>\nkeep fro using his neck.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIs there anything else we should be doing or red flags<br/>\nwe should be looking for or anything?
