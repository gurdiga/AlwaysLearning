He has been in school for three months and two months ago, we took him out of school. Since then he&#39;s getting more and more reluctant to go out of the house. He&#39;s not the same as your son, Berend still goes out almost everyday, but it&#39;s not the same as it used to be.<br/>\nI think he doesn&#39;t want to go out as much anymore because he has a choice now. And now that he gets to decide for himself, he protects himself against all the impressions he gets (is that proper English?) when he goes outside of the house. When we do persuade him to go out, at the end of the afternoon Berend is angry, easily frustrated and mainly just bouncing of our walls... So I do think that he knows what&#39;s best for him and at the moment that is not going out too much.<br/>\n<br/>\nBerend doesn&#39;t squeeze, but he hits and he pushes his sister (2,5 yo) over. He hurts me too. Since we started unschooling and started to lift the many controls that we had inadvertently put in place, it is getting better. But still, whenever he is frustrated, he will run over to his sister and throw her to the ground.<br/>\nI am working on controlling him less and being a nicer mom to him. I&#39;m just like Berend, just as easily frustrated. So that&#39;s a nice combination for fireworks. When I&#39;m patient, cheery, peaceful and explain things calmly in a friendly tone of voice, Berend hardly ever acts out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have a solution ready for your situation, but this is what we are working on and I think it&#39;s helping us.<br/>\n<br/>\nEva</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":195268684,"authorName":"Shannon D.

Unprovoked, and usually not out of<br/>\nanger.  It&#39;s as if he has something bottled up and the only way he knows to<br/>\nlet it out is to squeeze or hit.  Mostly it&#39;s random squeezing, and when it<br/>\nis anger-related it&#39;ll be hitting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it&#39;s hard squeezing, but not quite pinching, mostly to me and his<br/>\n3-year-old sister.  When I&#39;m not around it doesn&#39;t happen as frequently.<br/>\nLast night I was helping him get ready for bed, and he squeezed my<br/>\nshoulders.  I told him I didn&#39;t like it and to stop.  He did it again, and I<br/>\nmoved his hands away.  The third time he went to do it I pushed him away.  I<br/>\nfelt mean and awful for pushing him.  I honestly don&#39;t know what to do to<br/>\nmake it stop.  This happens multiple times a day - multiple times an hour I<br/>\nthink, though I&#39;ve never really counted.  He can&#39;t identify why he does it,<br/>\nand I don&#39;t know the triggers, as hard as I try, I don&#39;t see it coming most<br/>\nof the time.  I respond in a way where I&#39;m sure it&#39;s clear that I don&#39;t like<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hitting is usually a bit different.  Sometimes it&#39;s out of nowhere - a<br/>\nwalk-by with a whack.   Sometimes I know it&#39;s because he&#39;s not getting what<br/>\nhe wants - for instance, sometimes he&#39;ll want me to play something with him,<br/>\nand I&#39;ll say sure, in five mins after I&#39;m done doing something with Simi<br/>\n(his sister) ... and then he&#39;ll jump on me, hit me, etc, nearly the entire<br/>\ntime he&#39;s waiting.  I don&#39;t ask him to wait often, and when I get that<br/>\nresponse from him when I do, I don&#39;t know what to do.  I know it&#39;s a<br/>\njealously thing where he wants my full attention, and I give him a lot of<br/>\nattention, and there are times when I&#39;ve already started something with Simi<br/>\nand can&#39;t give him what he wants immediately.  I don&#39;t know, maybe in his<br/>\nmind he&#39;s waiting more frequently than I realize - he gets a lot of one on<br/>\none time with me, and if my husband&#39;s here, I&#39;ll ask him to help distract<br/>\nwhile I finish up with his sister.  This is just one example - there are<br/>\nothers.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo after being squeezed too hard last night, I lectured him as we were<br/>\nlaying in bed - told him how much I don&#39;t like it, and how I want to help<br/>\nhim not to squeeze and hit, and did he have any ideas?  And how if he hit<br/>\npeople that weren&#39;t me or his dad or his sister he could get in big trouble,<br/>\nespecially when he&#39;s older.  I scared the crap out of him, and regret having<br/>\ngone so far with it.  I was kind of rambling, and I wasn&#39;t saying it to<br/>\ncreate fear, but that&#39;s what I did.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t find it now, but I remember that Sandra wrote in a post a month or<br/>\nso ago something about the first step of having a child that doesn&#39;t hit is<br/>\nto be the mom of a child that doesn&#39;t hit ... I was stumped then on what<br/>\nthat meant, and think about if often after the squeezing / hitting and don&#39;t<br/>\nknow how to be that mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46240,"nextTopicId":46355}}
