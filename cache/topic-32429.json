Unfortunately, I get","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1886493866\">The &quot;tag line&quot; of the accountability association I run in SC to allow <br/>\nfamilies to homeschool is &quot;Childhood is NOT a dress rehearsal.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, I get reminded of this every now and then. Not that I <br/>\ndon&#39;t *need* to be reminded. It&#39;s just that I wish I weren&#39;t reminded <br/>\nin such a harsh way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think most traditional, conventional parents think of something <br/>\ndifferent when they hear or read it. I think they start considering <br/>\nthat we only have this one chance to push our children to do better, to <br/>\nbe better, and to strive harder for that medical degree or career <br/>\nchoice or...&quot;success&quot; or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not the message I get.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been thinking about what to write now for several days to honor <br/>\nthe memory of Hannah Jenner, who died two years ago on February 24. I&#39;d <br/>\nwanted to toss out there that we really DO only have so much time to <br/>\nspend with our children---and even though we *think* have the rest of <br/>\ntheir lives to do and be with them, there&#39;s no guarantee that they <br/>\nwon&#39;t be taken from us a whole lot sooner than we think. The time they <br/>\nspend with us should be full of joy and fun and happy, happy thoughts. <br/>\nTheir time with us should be filled with *our* joy in them---that they <br/>\nknow that our world is a better place *because* of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHannah&#39;s short life is a tough reminder for me to enjoy the children I <br/>\nhave---and every single minute. And not a day goes by that I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink of Hannah (and Sam Wilkerson and Jacob Strebler). &#39;Cause I just <br/>\ndon&#39;t know what I would do without Cameron and Duncan. But sometimes, <br/>\nwhen I&#39;m not my best and my temper is short, I *need* that little <br/>\nreminder---that this time is a gift.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nToo often, parents can work so hard helping our children &quot;become&quot; that <br/>\nwe forget to enjoy Who They *Are*--right now, this minute.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa Heyman&#39;s passing yesterday has stunned this community. And I just <br/>\ncan&#39;t imagine the pain and loss the Gauchmans are experiencing right <br/>\nnow. But I *know* that the girls, Roxy and Fire, will know that their <br/>\nmom truly valued the time she had with them. She chose to keep the <br/>\ngirls close and let them grow &quot;In Their Own Way, In Their Own Time.&quot;  <br/>\nThat&#39;s a gift we can ALL give our children. To accept Who They <br/>\nAre---and to revel in it!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have that choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa understood that childhood is not a dress rehearsal. Lisa worked <br/>\nhard to give her girls he space they needed to grow. She gave them <br/>\ninspired, joyful childhoods. There&#39;s not a doubt in my mind that Roxy <br/>\nand Fire will thrive in spite of their huge, huge loss. And a big part <br/>\nof that is the love and acceptance Lisa showered on them. They will <br/>\nkept warm with her light.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer passing will continue to be a reminder that *my* time with my kids <br/>\nis limited as well. I can choose to make the most of each moment with <br/>\nthem as she did. Our world is brighter because of Lisa. And I&#39;m glad I <br/>\ngot to know her.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch Love and Many Hugs to Larry and Roxy and Fire.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMore new features than ever.
