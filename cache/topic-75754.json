It imposes what Mom values.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sends a message that the &quot;This feels right,&quot; and &quot;This feels wrong,&quot; voices he tests out can&#39;t to be trusted. It&#39;s Mom and other experts who know what is best for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing deprived of what you love grows a greater desire for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sends a message that might makes right. That the way to get your way is to be more powerful and impose it on someone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Balance is a good thing. Moderation is a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There isn&#39;t a universal measure of balance or moderation. <br/>\n<br/>\nShould balance and moderation apply to love? To laughter? To joy?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor unschooling parents variety and choice is what they need to offer. If they get to understand their inner voice, they will be able to find what works for them no matter how life changes. It isn&#39;t balance they need. It&#39;s the ability to choose what feels right and stop when things don&#39;t feel right.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat ability won&#39;t come by silencing their inner voice. It comes from letting them try out their ideas. It comes from sharing ideas for them to try.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sometimes we need to help someone see that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you presume there&#39;s a universal balance based on what *you* feel is right, then I suppose that&#39;s true.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is a triathlete. His idea of right involves several hours of working out. I prefer curling up with some good questions to answer and other kinds of writing. What I find right is a lot of computer time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be dismissive to decide our own rights were right for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You have every reason to worry about the health of their eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Can you provide links to research? Not articles that pass on that fear. But actual research.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You also have every reason to worry about your child sitting all day.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is he sitting longer than kids do in school?<br/>\n<br/>\nWorry isn&#39;t helpful. Ideas are helpful. Dismissing a child&#39;s preferences shows kids that the way to solve problems is to be more powerful so you can impose your solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nAsking what ideas unschoolers have found useful in helping gaming kids be more active is helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrampolines. Exercise balls to sit on. Having room so they can stand and move around while they play. Planning outings. Ask kids for ideas. Being aware of good stopping points and offering activities that are even better are a few ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So what if they&#39;re bored without a controller in their hand. <br/>\n&gt; They&#39;ll figure out something else to do. Boredom can be a good thing. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So what if my husband is bored without a bike to ride, or a trail to run on?

art projects.&gt;&gt;<br clear=\"none\"></span><br clear=\"none\">Hate is a pretty strong word. &nbsp;Maybe he&#39;s not interested in certain art projects. &nbsp;Maybe he resents the way art is presented to him. &nbsp;Maybe he does hate art projects. &nbsp;I feel like that&#39;s a little sad if true though.<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1121766427yui_3_16_0_1_1427153874260_10316\"><br

artist. When we started unschooling Ethan, I thought art looked like it had been presented to me in school. &nbsp;Painting, drawing, sculpting, fashion, design--neatly packed subjects with well defined conditions. &nbsp;I presented art to Ethan this way. &nbsp;He found that limiting and boring. &nbsp;Now I better understand why. &nbsp;I didn&#39;t then. &nbsp;I remember feeling sad because I believed he didn&#39;t like art. &nbsp;But really he was rejecting the way I was presenting art. &nbsp;Not art. &nbsp;What I didn&#39;t realize was that he understood art more than I did, because for him it was bigger than the boxes I wanted to put it in. &nbsp;Art held more potential than that, and he knew it. &nbsp;I didn&#39;t. &nbsp;</div><div><br clear=\"none\"></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1121766427yui_3_16_0_1_1427153874260_10317\">Just the other day Ethan and I were planning to play on our game of &quot;Don&#39;t Starve Together.&quot; &nbsp;We had been playing on the same game for a couple days, and I was talking about building a house when we resumed. &nbsp;Earlier in the day I had been talking about when we move, reflecting on making myself a place in our new apartment to make art. &nbsp;Connecting what I had talked about earlier with what we were planning in that moment, Ethan said to me &quot;Well, if you make a house in Don&#39;t Starve...that&#39;s art!&quot; &nbsp;And he was right! &nbsp;I didn&#39;t have to wait to move to make a place for myself to make art. &nbsp;I could do it anywhere, any way, with anything I chose to use my creative skills and imagination on. &nbsp;Looking at it that way is so rich and exciting—so much more about making the most of every moment in ways that can be boundless and full of the essence of the things we love to do. &nbsp;</div><div><br clear=\"none\"></div><div>He still understands better than I do that there are truly no clear borders in subjects. &nbsp;That goes for art, for math, for history, for science, for all of it. &nbsp;He gets it without having to think about it. &nbsp;I love that he understands that better than me. &nbsp;It means I haven&#39;t limited him too much. &nbsp;I feel pretty good about that.</div><div><br clear=\"none\"></div><div>Karen James</div><style type=\"text/css\">#ygrps-yiv-1121766427 #ygrps-yiv-1121766427yiv3418057088

Don&#39;t try to be content staying home. Find ways to be joyful about staying home. Home is awesome! It&#39;s warm, it&#39;s dry, it&#39;s full of food and love and tv programmes to watch and books to read and sofas to snuggle on and beds to nap in.&nbsp;<br><br>&quot;<span style=\"font-size:12.8000001907349px;\">I think part of my problem is that we don&#39;t know any other local unschoolers. The only people I could ask to watch the kids are my parents or our school-at-home friends. All of whom would question the all day gaming. That makes me sort of feel alone in this.&quot;<br><br>Something I found held me back loads when I was first learning about unschooling was that I would keep coming back with &#39;yes, but&#39; all the time. Constantly citing reasons why something won&#39;t work will not help you one bit in moving forwards with unschooling. As soon as you hear yourself begin to say &#39;yes, but&#39;, stop yourself and, instead, think &#39;maybe...&#39; and let the ideas filter in, give them time. Soon they&#39;ll begin to turn into ideas that *will* work in your life.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size:12.8000001907349px;\">&quot;I&#39;ll still hold out hope that when it finally warms up here they will be more interested in venturing out again. The snow has started melting a little bit!&quot;<br><br>And you absolutely need to let go of this! Why would you want them to want to give up something they love so much? I knew a family where the dad wanted the children to go to bed early and wake early. On asking him to really dig deep into why that was, it turned out he didn&#39;t want them to &#39;become nocturnal&#39; because he didn&#39;t want to miss seeing them during the day. All very lovely but it was about *him* not about the children. This is about what *you* want, not what your children want. If you want to unschool, you&#39;ll be focusing on helping them do what they want, not constantly hoping they&#39;ll magically want to do what you want. Think creatively. Don&#39;t respond with reasons why you can&#39;t do this or that. Just believe that there is an answer and that it&#39;s a joyful one for you *and* for your children and an answer will come to you. So long as you think you&#39;re stuck or trapped, you will be.<br><br>Clare</p></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-2025871104gmail_extra\"><br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-2025871104gmail_quote\">On 23 March 2015 at 19:37, Sandra@...

When we started unschooling Ethan, I thought art looked like it had been presented to me in school. &nbsp;Painting, drawing, sculpting, fashion, design--neatly packed subjects with well defined conditions. &nbsp;I presented art to Ethan this way. &nbsp;He found that limiting and boring. &nbsp;Now I better understand why. &nbsp;I didn&#39;t then. &nbsp;I remember feeling sad because I believed he didn&#39;t like art. &nbsp;But really he was rejecting the way I was presenting art. &nbsp;Not art. &nbsp;What I didn&#39;t realize was that he understood art more than I did, because for him it was bigger than the boxes I wanted to put it in. &nbsp;Art held more potential than that, and he knew it. &nbsp;I didn&#39;t. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Just the other day Ethan and I were

&nbsp;Earlier in the day I had been talking about when we move, reflecting on making myself a place in our new apartment to make art. &nbsp;Connecting what I had talked about earlier with what we were planning in that moment, Ethan said to me &quot;Well, if you make a house in Don&#39;t Starve...that&#39;s art!&quot; &nbsp;And he was right! &nbsp;I didn&#39;t have to wait to move to make a place for myself to make art. &nbsp;I could do it anywhere, any way, with anything I chose to use my creative skills and imagination on. &nbsp;Looking at it that way is so rich and exciting—so much more about making the most of every moment in ways that can be boundless and full of the essence of the things we love to do. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>He still understands better than I do that there are truly no clear borders in subjects. &nbsp;That goes for art, for math, for history, for science, for all of it. &nbsp;He gets it without having to think about it. &nbsp;I love that he understands that better than me. &nbsp;It means I haven&#39;t limited him too much. &nbsp;I feel pretty good about that.</div><div><br></div><div>Karen James</div><style

I realize 6 months isn&#39;t really that long though. &quot;<br clear=\"none\"><br clear=\"none\">Deschooling lasts forever in a culture that is disempowering and schoolish. You need to throw yourself into your own deschooling. Unpick, unpick, unpick *all* the time.

Well get outside, then - garden; ask another adult if they&#39;d mind sitting in the house while you go shopping/for a walk; go out in the evenings when your partner is home.&nbsp;<br clear=\"none\"><br clear=\"none\">Because you want them to do different things? Why? What&#39;s wrong with doing the same thing every day? It&#39;s the path to becoming an expert. Concert pianists practice for hours and hours every day. Would that feel more acceptable to you? If so, why? If not, why not?<br clear=\"none\"><br clear=\"none\">I would suggest writing a long list of all the things you can possibly think of that might make *you* feel lit up - things that you feel &#39;squee&#39; about (a word we use in our house to denote an excited feeling...what we look forward to on waking etc.). I like playing our piano, which I&#39;m waiting to be repaired...I&#39;m getting it back today and can&#39;t wait! I love knitting and crocheting and my work, which I do two days per week, and my studying. I love working in my garden. When you learn the value of doing things *you* love, you&#39;ll feel more able to accept how wonderful it is for your children do the things *they* love and, rather than just *allowing* them to do those things, you&#39;ll begin to genuinely want to *help* them to do those things.&nbsp;<br clear=\"none\"><br clear=\"none\">Think, also, about how you would feel if you knew your partner was hovering around hoping you&#39;d soon get bored of the things you love, thinking that those things aren&#39;t enough on their own and that you ought to be doing other stuff and apply that feeling to your children&#39;s experience of doing something they love all the while knowing that you don&#39;t like it and wish they&#39;d do something else.<br clear=\"none\"><br clear=\"none\">Clare</span></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-846531045yiv4779661186qtdSeparateBR\"><br clear=\"none\"><br clear=\"none\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-846531045yiv4779661186yqt0329796531\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-846531045yiv4779661186yqt79026\"><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-846531045yiv4779661186gmail_extra\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-846531045yiv4779661186yui_3_16_0_1_1427126243631_12074\"><br clear=\"none\"><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-846531045yiv4779661186gmail_quote\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-846531045yiv4779661186yui_3_16_0_1_1427126243631_12077\">On 23 March 2015 at 05:17, K Pennell <a rel=\"nofollow\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrsringsabre@...\">mrsringsabre@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] <span dir=\"ltr\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-846531045yiv4779661186yui_3_16_0_1_1427126243631_12076\">&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" shape=\"rect\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-846531045yiv4779661186yui_3_16_0_1_1427126243631_12075\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br clear=\"none\"><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-846531045yiv4779661186gmail_quote\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-846531045yiv4779661186yui_3_16_0_1_1427126243631_12079\" style=\"border-left:1px #ccc solid;\">\n\n\n<u></u>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-846531045yiv4779661186yui_3_16_0_1_1427126243631_12078\" style=\"background-color:#fff;\">\n<span>&nbsp;</span>\n\n\n<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-846531045yiv4779661186yui_3_16_0_1_1427126243631_12125\">\n  <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-846531045yiv4779661186yui_3_16_0_1_1427126243631_12124\">\n\n\n    <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-846531045yiv4779661186yui_3_16_0_1_1427126243631_12123\">\n      \n      \n      <div></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-846531045yiv4779661186yui_3_16_0_1_1427126243631_12122\" style=\"color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-846531045yiv4779661186yui_3_16_0_1_1427126243631_12121\">I&#39;ve noticed my 12 year old plays a lot more video games in the winter.

They have not shown interest in any activity other than playing video games (my older son on the PC, my younger son on the Xbox). They will hardly leave the house without me begging or bribing them. I have tried to engage them in other activities (playing a board game, cooking with me, going outside, making an art project together, etc.) My younger son (5) will sometimes go along with a different activity for a short amount of time before returning to the Xbox. My older son (12) will not show interest in any other activity. I really don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m exaggerating this. He sleeps, eats, and sits at the computer. That has been his daily routine for months now. <br clear=\"none\"><br clear=\"none\">I&#39;ve been reading a lot and trying to deeply absorb the principles of radical unschooling for 6 months now. I was really sold on the idea until the past couple of weeks. I&#39;m not so confident anymore though. I&#39;m not feeling sparkly or inspired at all lately. I&#39;m trying hard to be understanding and accepting, but I&#39;ve been wanting to pull the plug on these devices for the last few days now. I would really appreciate feedback. Is this behavior normal? How long will it last? Am I doing something wrong? I don&#39;t want to bounce back to the opposite extreme, but I don&#39;t know how much longer I can keep faith. I&#39;ve read about deschooling, but I don&#39;t think we should really have that much deschooling to do. My 5 year old has never done any formal schooling or really had any computer/game limits, as I eased up by the time he was old enough to be interested. I used to limit my 12 year old&#39;s computer time to 3-4 hours a day and require that he did some reading/writing/math activities, but have not done that for 6 months now. We have always been very relaxed/eclectic homeschoolers though and have never done a boxed curriculum or anything. Both of my boys used to spend a lot of time playing outside. (I think my younger one still would if the older would go, but he doesn&#39;t go alone, and I&#39;m not as fun I guess.)<br clear=\"none\"><br clear=\"none\">I&#39;ve been asking questions and showing interest in my older son&#39;s PC\n games. I&#39;ve brought him food/snacks at the computer (I used to frown on\n eating at the computer), I&#39;ve supported his interests by buying him \ngames, his own server, and helping him upgrade our PC for gaming. Maybe \nI&#39;ve made it too enticing? I can&#39;t really play with him (only 1 \ncomputer), but I play Xbox Minecraft with my younger son often. I&#39;m \ntrying to build a trusting, supportive relationship. I would just really\n like him to spend at least a little bit of time on an activity that is \nnot on the computer. Is that unreasonable of me?<br clear=\"none\"><br clear=\"none\"><br clear=\"none\">A few things that I know exacerbate this issue for me - <br clear=\"none\"><br clear=\"none\">I&#39;m the type of person that has to get out of the house daily or I go stir crazy. Even just to the grocery store or somewhere. I&#39;ve been leaving my boys home alone together for all of my shopping and errands as they do not want to come (and I stopped forcing them to 6 months ago).&nbsp; <br clear=\"none\"><br clear=\"none\">My parents have always been supportive of our homeschooling, but lately my mother has asked me if we have done any schooling lately or if older son has read a book or anything recently. (We live close and spend a lot of time together.) She is understanding of our relaxed approach to homeschooling, but I have a hard time confidently defending myself when he has done nothing but computer games recently. (His computer activity does involve a lot of reading and writing, so I am not so much concerned about that. I am more concerned about the lack of physical activity and the body/eye strain of 12 consecutive hours in front of the computer.)<br clear=\"none\"><br clear=\"none\">The weather has been cold and miserable here in the Northeast USA lately, which makes it not so enjoyable to spend time outside. We probably all have cabin fever.<br clear=\"none\"><br clear=\"none\"><br clear=\"none\"><br clear=\"none\">I would love any advice to help me feel better about our situation or any tips on improving our life. <br clear=\"none\"><br clear=\"none\">Thanks,<br clear=\"none\">Erin<br clear=\"none\"><br clear=\"none\"><div><span><br clear=\"none\"></span></div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"none\">\n\n\n<br

The only people I could ask to watch the kids are my parents or our school-at-home friends. All of whom would question the all day gaming. That makes me sort of feel alone in this. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Usually the kids and I can all have fun together and don&#39;t need anybody else.  Lately I can&#39;t relate to them as much though. I can&#39;t stay interested in their games for as long as they do and have felt that fully supporting their interests has squandered my own. My husband calls me a gamer, but after a couple hours I&#39;m done and ready for something different. I appreciate the suggestions though! I will try to start some of my own in the house hobbies. I haven&#39;t done any knitting in a long time and I&#39;ve also always wanted to try making a quilt. I&#39;m not very crafty, but I&#39;ll give it a try. I will focus on activities like that and try to be content staying home. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I&#39;ll still hold out hope that when it finally warms up here they will be more interested in venturing out again. The snow has started melting a little bit!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Anyway, just writing everything out and trying to explain my feelings has helped me better understand them myself. I will take that reflection and all of the responses and try to view our life/situation in a different, more positive light.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thanks again,<br>\nErin</p>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-773100038gmail_quote\">On Mar 23, 2015 5:38 AM, &quot;kirkpatrick clare <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:clare.kirkpatrick@...\">clare.kirkpatrick@...</a> [AlwaysLearning]&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br><blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-773100038gmail_quote\" style=\"margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;\">\n\n\n<u></u>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n<div style=\"background-color:#fff;\">\n<span> </span>\n\n\n<div>\n  <div>\n\n\n    <div>\n      \n      \n      <p><div dir=\"ltr\">&quot;<span style=\"font-size:12.8000001907349px;\"> I wasn&#39;t implying that we didn&#39;t need to deschool, just that I didn&#39;t think we should need THAT much.

Well get outside, then - garden; ask another adult if they&#39;d mind sitting in the house while you go shopping/for a walk; go out in the evenings when your partner is home. <br><br>Because you want them to do different things? Why? What&#39;s wrong with doing the same thing every day? It&#39;s the path to becoming an expert. Concert pianists practice for hours and hours every day. Would that feel more acceptable to you? If so, why? If not, why not?<br><br>I would suggest writing a long list of all the things you can possibly think of that might make *you* feel lit up - things that you feel &#39;squee&#39; about (a word we use in our house to denote an excited feeling...what we look forward to on waking etc.). I like playing our piano, which I&#39;m waiting to be repaired...I&#39;m getting it back today and can&#39;t wait! I love knitting and crocheting and my work, which I do two days per week, and my studying. I love working in my garden. When you learn the value of doing things *you* love, you&#39;ll feel more able to accept how wonderful it is for your children do the things *they* love and, rather than just *allowing* them to do those things, you&#39;ll begin to genuinely want to *help* them to do those things. <br><br>Think, also, about how you would feel if you knew your partner was hovering around hoping you&#39;d soon get bored of the things you love, thinking that those things aren&#39;t enough on their own and that you ought to be doing other stuff and apply that feeling to your children&#39;s experience of doing something they love all the while knowing that you don&#39;t like it and wish they&#39;d do something else.<br><br>Clare</span></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-773100038gmail_extra\"><br><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-773100038gmail_quote\">On 23 March 2015 at 05:17, K Pennell <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrsringsabre@...\">mrsringsabre@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] <span dir=\"ltr\">&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-773100038gmail_quote\" style=\"border-left:1px #ccc solid;\">\n\n\n<u></u>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n<div style=\"background-color:#fff;\">\n<span> </span>\n\n\n<div>\n  <div>\n\n\n    <div>\n      \n      \n      <p></p><div style=\"color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;\"><div>I&#39;ve noticed my 12 year old plays a lot more video games in the winter.

They have not shown interest in any activity other than playing video games (my older son on the PC, my younger son on the Xbox). They will hardly leave the house without me begging or bribing them. I have tried to engage them in other activities (playing a board game, cooking with me, going outside, making an art project together, etc.) My younger son (5) will sometimes go along with a different activity for a short amount of time before returning to the Xbox. My older son (12) will not show interest in any other activity. I really don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m exaggerating this. He sleeps, eats, and sits at the computer. That has been his daily routine for months now. <br><br>I&#39;ve been reading a lot and trying to deeply absorb the principles of radical unschooling for 6 months now. I was really sold on the idea until the past couple of weeks. I&#39;m not so confident anymore though. I&#39;m not feeling sparkly or inspired at all lately. I&#39;m trying hard to be understanding and accepting, but I&#39;ve been wanting to pull the plug on these devices for the last few days now. I would really appreciate feedback. Is this behavior normal? How long will it last? Am I doing something wrong? I don&#39;t want to bounce back to the opposite extreme, but I don&#39;t know how much longer I can keep faith. I&#39;ve read about deschooling, but I don&#39;t think we should really have that much deschooling to do. My 5 year old has never done any formal schooling or really had any computer/game limits, as I eased up by the time he was old enough to be interested. I used to limit my 12 year old&#39;s computer time to 3-4 hours a day and require that he did some reading/writing/math activities, but have not done that for 6 months now. We have always been very relaxed/eclectic homeschoolers though and have never done a boxed curriculum or anything. Both of my boys used to spend a lot of time playing outside. (I think my younger one still would if the older would go, but he doesn&#39;t go alone, and I&#39;m not as fun I guess.)<br><br>I&#39;ve been asking questions and showing interest in my older son&#39;s PC\n games. I&#39;ve brought him food/snacks at the computer (I used to frown on\n eating at the computer), I&#39;ve supported his interests by buying him \ngames, his own server, and helping him upgrade our PC for gaming. Maybe \nI&#39;ve made it too enticing? I can&#39;t really play with him (only 1 \ncomputer), but I play Xbox Minecraft with my younger son often. I&#39;m \ntrying to build a trusting, supportive relationship. I would just really\n like him to spend at least a little bit of time on an activity that is \nnot on the computer. Is that unreasonable of me?<br><br><br>A few things that I know exacerbate this issue for me - <br><br>I&#39;m the type of person that has to get out of the house daily or I go stir crazy. Even just to the grocery store or somewhere. I&#39;ve been leaving my boys home alone together for all of my shopping and errands as they do not want to come (and I stopped forcing them to 6 months ago).  <br><br>My parents have always been supportive of our homeschooling, but lately my mother has asked me if we have done any schooling lately or if older son has read a book or anything recently. (We live close and spend a lot of time together.) She is understanding of our relaxed approach to homeschooling, but I have a hard time confidently defending myself when he has done nothing but computer games recently. (His computer activity does involve a lot of reading and writing, so I am not so much concerned about that. I am more concerned about the lack of physical activity and the body/eye strain of 12 consecutive hours in front of the computer.)<br><br>The weather has been cold and miserable here in the Northeast USA lately, which makes it not so enjoyable to spend time outside.

They have not shown interest in any activity other than playing video games (my older son on the PC, my younger son on the Xbox). They will hardly leave the house without me begging or bribing them. I have tried to engage them in other activities (playing a board game, cooking with me, going outside, making an art project together, etc.) My younger son (5) will sometimes go along with a different activity for a short amount of time before returning to the Xbox. My older son (12) will not show interest in any other activity. I really don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m exaggerating this. He sleeps, eats, and sits at the computer. That has been his daily routine for months now. <br><br>I&#39;ve been reading a lot and trying to deeply absorb the principles of radical unschooling for 6 months now. I was really sold on the idea until the past couple of weeks. I&#39;m not so confident anymore though. I&#39;m not feeling sparkly or inspired at all lately. I&#39;m trying hard to be understanding and accepting, but I&#39;ve been wanting to pull the plug on these devices for the last few days now. I would really appreciate feedback. Is this behavior normal? How long will it last? Am I doing something wrong? I don&#39;t want to bounce back to the opposite extreme, but I don&#39;t know how much longer I can keep faith. I&#39;ve read about deschooling, but I don&#39;t think we should really have that much deschooling to do. My 5 year old has never done any formal schooling or really had any computer/game limits, as I eased up by the time he was old enough to be interested. I used to limit my 12 year old&#39;s computer time to 3-4 hours a day and require that he did some reading/writing/math activities, but have not done that for 6 months now. We have always been very relaxed/eclectic homeschoolers though and have never done a boxed curriculum or anything. Both of my boys used to spend a lot of time playing outside. (I think my younger one still would if the older would go, but he doesn&#39;t go alone, and I&#39;m not as fun I guess.)<br><br>I&#39;ve been asking questions and showing interest in my older son&#39;s PC\n games. I&#39;ve brought him food/snacks at the computer (I used to frown on\n eating at the computer), I&#39;ve supported his interests by buying him \ngames, his own server, and helping him upgrade our PC for gaming. Maybe \nI&#39;ve made it too enticing? I can&#39;t really play with him (only 1 \ncomputer), but I play Xbox Minecraft with my younger son often. I&#39;m \ntrying to build a trusting, supportive relationship. I would just really\n like him to spend at least a little bit of time on an activity that is \nnot on the computer. Is that unreasonable of me?<br><br><br>A few things that I know exacerbate this issue for me - <br><br>I&#39;m the type of person that has to get out of the house daily or I go stir crazy. Even just to the grocery store or somewhere. I&#39;ve been leaving my boys home alone together for all of my shopping and errands as they do not want to come (and I stopped forcing them to 6 months ago).&nbsp; <br><br>My parents have always been supportive of our homeschooling, but lately my mother has asked me if we have done any schooling lately or if older son has read a book or anything recently. (We live close and spend a lot of time together.) She is understanding of our relaxed approach to homeschooling, but I have a hard time confidently defending myself when he has done nothing but computer games recently. (His computer activity does involve a lot of reading and writing, so I am not so much concerned about that. I am more concerned about the lack of physical activity and the body/eye strain of 12 consecutive hours in front of the computer.)<br><br>The weather has been cold and miserable here in the Northeast USA lately, which makes it not so enjoyable to spend time outside. We probably all have cabin fever.<br><br><br><br>I would love any advice to help me feel better about our situation or any tips on improving our life. <br><br>Thanks,<br>Erin<br><br><div><span><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-28504810yiv7517942982yui-cursor\"></span></div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n\n<div style=\"color:white;clear:both;\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<br><br></div> </div> </div>  </div></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] lacking confidence and inspiration","postDate":"1427082228","msgId":75761,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEMxMUY3RTc1LTQwQUQtNDFENy05MzcxLUIwRTMyN0Q1MUI5RUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBSFI9eEdnZVB6Wm5pS19YdE1jZ2ZOal83UXFWcXJWK3MwTW5XeUN2KzVEc040Vis5Z0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG1lbmg3dSsxanA2MTl0QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPDU0M0QzNURFLTNGQzEtNDUwNy1BNzVCLUFCQTU2QjdFN0IxN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPENBSFI9eEdnZVB6Wm5pS19YdE1jZ2ZOal83UXFWcXJWK3MwTW5XeUN2KzVEc040Vis5Z0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":75760,"nextInTopic":75762,"prevInTime":75760,"nextInTime":75762,"topicId":75754,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- I wasn t implying that we didn t need to deschool, just that I didn t think we should need THAT much.

I realize 6 months isn&#39;t really that long though.  </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am just frustrated and feel like I&#39;m not doing enough for him. I&#39;m not concerned about anything academic,  I&#39;m confident that my boys know and are constantly learning everything they&#39;ll need in that sense.  It&#39;s not even that I don&#39;t approve of the game playing, I&#39;m fine with that. I enjoy it too. I just would like something else in addition to it. I worry about the lack of physical activity. I personally can&#39;t understand why he wouldn&#39;t want to leave his room. I enjoy playing with them for an hour or so, but then I need a break.  My eyes hurt if I stare at a screen too long. We used to all enjoy hikes,  skiing, swimming,  etc. Now I have to bribe or force him to come along (which I admit I did twice this winter). He had a blast skiing once we got there, but he never wants to go. I honestly would be just as frustrated if he were reading books all day in his room. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, his best friend&#39;s family invited us to play laser tag with them tonight. He didn&#39;t want to go. He did finally decide to come after the rest of us said we were going (and his friend really wanted him),  but he was reluctant. He had a lot of fun once we got there though.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He mentioned to me awhile back (maybe 3 months ago) that he&#39;s noticed I don&#39;t ask him to get off the computer anymore and that he appreciates that. I feel like I&#39;ve shown I&#39;m trustworthy to not take it away. (Right now I have the urge to, but I won&#39;t.) How long does it take for it to lose that special value? I know there is no right answer to that question...</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I&#39;m sorry for all the negativity. It has been building up inside me for the last week or so. I don&#39;t share any of it with my children,  so I wanted to vent somewhere.  I appreciate you calling me out. It&#39;s probably just my cabin fever. I would really like to get out and do more myself (skiing, sledding, skating, indoor swimming),  but when my kids don&#39;t want to leave I feel trapped at home. Our old lifestyle I would say we&#39;re going to do ____ today and make them come along. They would sometimes whine about going,  but always seem to have fun once out. Now that I&#39;ve stopped requiring them to do things they don&#39;t want to (unless really necessary) I feel like I don&#39;t get to do anything.  I leave them home alone for a short trip to the store, but wouldn&#39;t for a day of skiing.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Do any other mothers have this problem?  I can&#39;t afford a nanny/sitter unless I was working.  They could stay with a friend,  but they probably wouldn&#39;t want to leave the house to go there.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I love my kids and generally like spending my days with them. I just am having a hard time being cooped up. Hopefully once warmer spring weather makes it our way they will want to start adventuring out with me.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thanks,<br>\nErin </p>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1609614726gmail_quote\">On Mar 22, 2015 8:39 PM, &quot;Sandra Dodd Sandra@...

They have not shown interest in any activity other than playing video games (my older son on the PC, my younger son on the Xbox). They will hardly leave the house without me begging or bribing them. I have tried to engage them in other activities (playing a board game, cooking with me, going outside, making an art project together, etc.) My younger son (5) will sometimes go along with a different activity for a short amount of time before returning to the Xbox. My older son (12) will not show interest in any other activity. I really don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m exaggerating this. He sleeps, eats, and sits at the computer. That has been his daily routine for months now. <br><br>I&#39;ve been reading a lot and trying to deeply absorb the principles of radical unschooling for 6 months now. I was really sold on the idea until the past couple of weeks. I&#39;m not so confident anymore though. I&#39;m not feeling sparkly or inspired at all lately. I&#39;m trying hard to be understanding and accepting, but I&#39;ve been wanting to pull the plug on these devices for the last few days now. I would really appreciate feedback. Is this behavior normal? How long will it last? Am I doing something wrong? I don&#39;t want to bounce back to the opposite extreme, but I don&#39;t know how much longer I can keep faith. I&#39;ve read about deschooling, but I don&#39;t think we should really have that much deschooling to do. My 5 year old has never done any formal schooling or really had any computer/game limits, as I eased up by the time he was old enough to be interested. I used to limit my 12 year old&#39;s computer time to 3-4 hours a day and require that he did some reading/writing/math activities, but have not done that for 6 months now. We have always been very relaxed/eclectic homeschoolers though and have never done a boxed curriculum or anything. Both of my boys used to spend a lot of time playing outside. (I think my younger one still would if the older would go, but he doesn&#39;t go alone, and I&#39;m not as fun I guess.)<br><br>I&#39;ve been asking questions and showing interest in my older son&#39;s PC\n games. I&#39;ve brought him food/snacks at the computer (I used to frown on\n eating at the computer), I&#39;ve supported his interests by buying him \ngames, his own server, and helping him upgrade our PC for gaming. Maybe \nI&#39;ve made it too enticing? I can&#39;t really play with him (only 1 \ncomputer), but I play Xbox Minecraft with my younger son often. I&#39;m \ntrying to build a trusting, supportive relationship. I would just really\n like him to spend at least a little bit of time on an activity that is \nnot on the computer. Is that unreasonable of me?<br><br><br>A few things that I know exacerbate this issue for me - <br><br>I&#39;m the type of person that has to get out of the house daily or I go stir crazy. Even just to the grocery store or somewhere. I&#39;ve been leaving my boys home alone together for all of my shopping and errands as they do not want to come (and I stopped forcing them to 6 months ago).&nbsp; <br><br>My parents have always been supportive of our homeschooling, but lately my mother has asked me if we have done any schooling lately or if older son has read a book or anything recently. (We live close and spend a lot of time together.) She is understanding of our relaxed approach to homeschooling, but I have a hard time confidently defending myself when he has done nothing but computer games recently. (His computer activity does involve a lot of reading and writing, so I am not so much concerned about that. I am more concerned about the lack of physical activity and the body/eye strain of 12 consecutive hours in front of the computer.)<br><br>The weather has been cold and miserable here in the Northeast USA lately, which makes it not so enjoyable to spend time outside. We probably all have cabin fever.<br><br><br><br>I would love any advice to help me feel better about our situation or any tips on improving our life. <br><br>Thanks,<br>Erin<br><br><p><span><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-294708683yui-cursor\"></span></p></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75759,"nextTopicId":75787}}
