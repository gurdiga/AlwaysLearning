I did all<br/>\nthe high school / college thinking stuff, but the coolest thing I did when I<br/>\nwas 16 is that in June (after junior year) my best friend and I moved from<br/>\nTampa, Florida to Charlotte, NC and lived with her dad for the summer while<br/>\nwe worked at an amusement park.  After working for a few months, we set off<br/>\non a road trip that took us southwest to the US/Mexico border in Texas and<br/>\nthen back east home to Tampa.  That trip was easily the best two weeks of my<br/>\nlife so far, and I&#39;m SO glad I did it.  I&#39;m so glad my parents happily let<br/>\nme do it.  This was in 1994, we had no cell phones or anything.  We were two<br/>\n16 year old girls driving a 1978 VW Bus.  I&#39;m kind of amazed my parents let<br/>\nme do that.   (I&#39;d put MY daughter in a more reliable vehicle and make sure<br/>\nshe has a phone! :) And if my daughter wants to do that, I wouldn&#39;t call HER<br/>\ntoo often I hope.  We called home every few days if I recall correctly, I<br/>\nthink maybe my friend needed to call every day.)  But the fact that they<br/>\ntrusted us is amazing.  And we did have a great trip - the flat tire that<br/>\ndrove us to hitchhike and the blown starter that forced me to drive from<br/>\nLouisiana to Florida without turning the engine off AT ALL just add to the<br/>\nadventure... <br/>\n<br/>\nI think you&#39;ve gotten good ideas from others on this list, and I think if I<br/>\nwere you I&#39;d take a break and then maybe try to get through the coursework<br/>\nto get the diploma.  Maybe find something else to talk to your dad about --<br/>\nmy dad sounds similar to yours but during high school it was easy for us to<br/>\nconnect by doing projects together.  Maybe if there is something for you and<br/>\nhe to do together, or talk about, he won&#39;t be so caught up in school?

He is 13 1/2, which is <br/>\ndifferent than 16, but I&#39;m still going back to the question in my mind, which is why is a 16 <br/>\nyear old experiencing this much pressure from parents regarding the future?  Where is the <br/>\nsupport and space for Claire to figure out what she would like to do?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe moment Claire expressed an interest in cooking, a whole future was laid out for <br/>\nculinary school.

By spending <br/>\nlots of time on the computer with the resources of the world at his fingertips.

It seems too soon <br/>\nto have answers to all this stuff.  If they are just trying to make conversation, maybe you <br/>\ncan be more proactive and talk about a hobby or interest you are into right now.  Or <br/>\nperhaps you can come up with a good answer that would stop questions, like, &quot;I am going <br/>\nto take classes at the JC until I decide for sure.&quot;  And that can be a good way to try some <br/>\ndifferent things, like cooking classes, without all the hefty financial commitment.

They are both school teachers.  She moved <br/>\nin with me just before high school began and finished 2 years of high <br/>\nschool.  They were completely against her quitting school to <br/>\nhomeschool.  She chose to enroll in an accredited correspondence <br/>\nprogram to finish her diploma because she knew they wanted her to <br/>\nhave a diploma.  But she has not done much school work this year.  We <br/>\nwere talking and I suggested she post to this list if she wanted to <br/>\nhear from real unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Claire:<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m feeling very frustrated and angry because I feel everyone around <br/>\nme expects me to do school and go on to college.  I don&#39;t know if I <br/>\nwant to go to college.  It makes no sense to me that something that <br/>\nseems so useless right now is so important to everyone else.  My mom <br/>\nhas mixed feelings about it.  She talks to me about unschooling but <br/>\nit is such a weird idea to me that I don&#39;t know what to think.  My <br/>\nstep dad feels I should at least finish my high school diploma <br/>\nbecause I&#39;m so close and mom agrees sometimes.  At the same time, I <br/>\nknow I do not want to finish this stupid coursework I have and I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to even think about anything to do with school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do unschooling teens do?  How do they learn?  Do they plan to go <br/>\nto college?  How do they answer questions about what is going on in <br/>\ntheir lives?  My dad, stepmom, friends and some relatives are <br/>\nconstantly asking me what courses I&#39;m taking, how my grades are, when <br/>\nI will graduate, have I taken the SAT, what colleges am I applying <br/>\nto, what major I want to be, where will I live, will I get a drivers <br/>\nlicense and car, how will I get to school if I don&#39;t drive, and lots <br/>\nof other stupid questions I don&#39;t have answers for right now.  I just <br/>\nwant to scream I DON&#39;T KNOW and DON&#39;T CARE RIGHT NOW.  Why do I have <br/>\nto make these decisions right now?<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I want to do right now is hang out with my friends, play World of <br/>\nWarcraft, and work 2 days a week at my part-time job that I love.  I <br/>\nwork at a gelato and chocolates place and love making the <br/>\nchocolates.  I&#39;ve thought about culinary school but my dad went with <br/>\nme to visit one a couple of weeks ago and now he and my stepmom are <br/>\nall into it and I don&#39;t know if I want to do it.  It&#39;s really <br/>\nexpensive and of course they told me they&#39;d be willing to help me pay <br/>\nfor school if I would live with them.  I really do not want to live <br/>\nwith them again.  My mom keeps asking me if I&#39;m going to finish my <br/>\nhigh school classes and I don&#39;t know that either.  I just really <br/>\ndon&#39;t know what to do right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to beth again:<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I&#39;ve not been helpful because of my mixed messages.  I really <br/>\nwould be supportive of her unschooling but I feel like she should <br/>\nmake a decision rather than waffling back and forth.  I think she is <br/>\nscared to not do school so she just keeps putting the schoolwork <br/>\noff.  Her dad has a similar problem solving method.  It&#39;s like she <br/>\njust wants the whole topic to go away, but then she goes to her dad&#39;s <br/>\nhouse and they talk incessantly about school & college.  Part of me <br/>\nthinks she should just finish the diploma because she can show it to <br/>\nthem and prove she can do it.  They told her if she quit school, <br/>\nshe&#39;d never graduate and would be a failure.  Their opinion seems <br/>\nreally important to her.  She&#39;s also told me that when she turns 18, <br/>\nshe wants to move to another state so she doesn&#39;t have to deal with <br/>\nthem.  I don&#39;t know what to do or what to say to her anymore.  Most <br/>\nof the time I leave her alone and/or tell her it&#39;s always her choice, <br/>\nbut her visits with her dad put us both on edge.  Argh!  But she also <br/>\nrefuses to stop visiting her dad because she really loves her dad <br/>\neven though she&#39;s always uncomfortable at their house.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do I help her when she doesn&#39;t even know what she wants?  I am <br/>\nnot surprised that she doesn&#39;t want to make such big decisions now <br/>\nbut she&#39;s being pressured on a daily basis by someone or other.  She <br/>\ntries to hide away in her room but at some point she&#39;s going to have <br/>\nto tell her dad about what she is doing or not doing.
