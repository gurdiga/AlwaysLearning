I forgot that my 5 year old and I had just put a pot of corn on the stove. :/ Pretty soon my 9 year old yelled out, &quot;I smell something burning!&quot;, so I ran to the kitchen. Yeah, you guessed it. Burned corn. YUK! So my house smells disgusting now. Plus, I think I just ruined a pot. I&#39;m thinking I need a timer to actually carry around with me, on my person, so I don&#39;t forget these important things. <br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle, The Distracted<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22208,"nextTopicId":22235}}
