They have valued traits. My 3rd is that easy going type <br/>\nyou mentioned. In her I see compliance, calm, already at 2. The book you <br/>\nmentioned sounds good, I have never heard of it before. Again, thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday Riley and I went to play tennis at the courts. He has asked to do <br/>\nthis with me for a few days. We finally found the time during Ashley&#39;s play <br/>\npractice. We spent 15 minutes or so hitting the ball over the net. He did <br/>\nnot once yell at me that I was hitting it wrong, as he has done in the past. <br/>\nWe played until he tired then dunked our sweaty heads under the water <br/>\nfaucet. A complete joyful experience for both of us. Hurry.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalk to you soon, Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nJoin the worldï¿½s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5085,"nextTopicId":5074}}
