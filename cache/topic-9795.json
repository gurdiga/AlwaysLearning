It was partly to get a sandwich and partly to see all the<br/>\nbeautiful colors and mostly because we know there won&#39;t be too many more<br/>\ndays of nice weather.  The tires on our car aren&#39;t very good and we may<br/>\nbe staying home a lot this winter.<br/>\n   <br/>\nSo we had this beautiful drive, and stopped here and there to look at<br/>\ngeese and deer and a dead coyote, who&#39;d been hit by a car.  We moved him<br/>\noff the road and put a ring of rocks around him.  It was Dylan&#39;s idea. <br/>\nWe didn&#39;t have any way to bury him but Dylan thought we should show our<br/>\nrespect. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe watched some remodeling work on an old building and stopped to see<br/>\nwhere a big fire had been last month, and found a new building there,<br/>\nnot<br/>\nfinished yet, but up and looking official.   We took our sandwiches to<br/>\nthe cemetery and looked at the old Russian graves.  Some of the granite<br/>\non the stones has worn away and we couldn&#39;t see the writing, but we<br/>\ncould<br/>\nfeel it.  It was in Russian, so we don&#39;t know what it said, but we<br/>\nimagined.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe walked. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe came home and Dylan had a Karate class.  There were only two students<br/>\ntonight including Dylan,  and the assistant instructor, Forest.   Forest<br/>\nwas homeschooled and is twenty two.  His brother Willow was the other<br/>\nstudent.  They are wonderful  young men and I love their mom.  She told<br/>\nme a story once about killing a pack rat that had gotten into her house<br/>\nwhile she was away.  Her husband took his sleeping bag down to the creek<br/>\nto get some sleep while she stalked this poor creature with a hunting<br/>\nknife and slashed it to death in her bedroom in the middle of the night.<br/>\n<br/>\nA gruesome tale.  She is my philosophical discussion partner.  You can<br/>\nprobably guess her philosophy of pack rats.   Today was Willow&#39;s 14th<br/>\nbirthday.   After Karate we went to the bowling alley for Willow&#39;s<br/>\nparty.<br/>\nI am not a bowler.   Dylan got a little better tonight and had fun with<br/>\nsome other kids that came to the party.  I received much instruction<br/>\nfrom<br/>\npeople half my size who launched their bowling balls from a squatting<br/>\nposition, swinging them back between their legs and then down the alley.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne must yell &quot;knock &#39;em all down!&quot; as the ball inches it&#39;s way to the<br/>\npins.  I  actually tried this technique but I didn&#39;t improve any.  Next<br/>\ntime maybe.  There was food and cake and soda and fun and then we rushed<br/>\nhome in time to get a call from David who is working out of town.<br/>\nDylan<br/>\nis watching Monty Python&#39;s Holy Grail right now,  -- You tiny brained<br/>\nwipers of other people&#39;s bottoms!--  <br/>\n<br/>\nHope you all had a good day... Dylan is going to sleep with me tonight<br/>\nhe<br/>\nsays, because I can keep his feet warm. = )<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

My boys couldn&#39;t get over the amount of school buses<br/>\nin one place!!  Zak and Eliott played together for about 6 hours and had<br/>\na great time.  They dug up the back garden and built a moat and a<br/>\ncastle.  It was fascinating to watch them on and off.

It was partly to get a sandwich and partly to see all the<br/>\nbeautiful colors and mostly because we know there won&#39;t be too many more<br/>\ndays of nice weather.  The tires on our car aren&#39;t very good and we may<br/>\nbe staying home a lot this winter.<br/>\n   <br/>\nSo we had this beautiful drive, and stopped here and there to look at<br/>\ngeese and deer and a dead coyote, who&#39;d been hit by a car.  We moved him<br/>\noff the road and put a ring of rocks around him.  It was Dylan&#39;s idea. <br/>\nWe didn&#39;t have any way to bury him but Dylan thought we should show our<br/>\nrespect. <br/>\n <br/>\nWe watched some remodeling work on an old building and stopped to see<br/>\nwhere a big fire had been last month, and found a new building there, not<br/>\nfinished yet, but up and looking official.   We took our sandwiches to<br/>\nthe cemetery and looked at the old Russian graves.  Some of the granite<br/>\non the stones has worn away and we couldn&#39;t see the writing, but we could<br/>\nfeel it.  It was in Russian, so we don&#39;t know what it said, but we<br/>\nimagined.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe walked. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe came home and Dylan had a Karate class.  There were only two students<br/>\ntonight including Dylan,  and the assistant instructor, Forest.   Forest<br/>\nwas homeschooled and is twenty two.  His brother Willow was the other<br/>\nstudent.  They are wonderful  young men and I love their mom.  She told<br/>\nme a story once about killing a pack rat that had gotten into her house<br/>\nwhile she was away.  Her husband took his sleeping bag down to the creek<br/>\nto get some sleep while she stalked this poor creature with a hunting<br/>\nknife and slashed it to death in her bedroom in the middle of the night. <br/>\nA gruesome tale.  She is my philosophical discussion partner.  You can<br/>\nprobably guess her philosophy of pack rats.   Today was Willow&#39;s 14th<br/>\nbirthday.   After Karate we went to the bowling alley for Willow&#39;s party.<br/>\n I am not a bowler.   Dylan got a little better tonight and had fun with<br/>\nsome other kids that came to the party.  I received much instruction from<br/>\npeople half my size who launched their bowling balls from a squatting<br/>\nposition, swinging them back between their legs and then down the alley. <br/>\nOne must yell &quot;knock &#39;em all down!&quot; as the ball inches it&#39;s way to the<br/>\npins.  I  actually tried this technique but I didn&#39;t improve any.  Next<br/>\ntime maybe.  There was food and cake and soda and fun and then we rushed<br/>\nhome in time to get a call from David who is working out of town.   Dylan<br/>\nis watching Monty Python&#39;s Holy Grail right now,  -- You tiny brained<br/>\nwipers of other people&#39;s bottoms!--  <br/>\n<br/>\nHope you all had a good day... Dylan is going to sleep with me tonight he<br/>\nsays, because I can keep his feet warm. = )<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9826,"nextTopicId":9794}}
