Directors Lament Increase in Home Sunday Schooling:<br/>\nSunday school enrollment in decline<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the academic year having ended in many parts of the country,<br/>\nChristian educators are disturbed by a dramatic decrease in Sunday<br/>\nschool enrollment for the upcoming year, a trend they say is largely<br/>\ndue to the growing popularity of home Sunday schooling. Home Sunday<br/>\nschooling, a system in which a child obtains Christian education at<br/>\nhome rather than in traditional church-sponsored Sunday schools, dwelt<br/>\nin relative obscurity-primarily in New England and the Pacific<br/>\nNorthwest-for nearly a decade before the recent upswing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSupporters say home Sunday schooling provides a vastly superior learning<br/>\nmodel for children, especially those who do not flourish in traditional<br/>\nclassroom settings. Critics contend that home Sunday schooled children<br/>\nmiss<br/>\nout on vital opportunities for socialization or fall short educationally.<br/>\n<br/>\nKatherine Eusibio, president of the Nashville-based nonprofit Homestead<br/>\nChristian Education, has been advocating for home Sunday schoolers for<br/>\neight<br/>\nyears. &quot;Many, if not most, students have difficulty learning about the<br/>\nChristian faith in traditional classroom settings,&quot; she argues. &quot;Bringing<br/>\nthe experience into the home allows children to learn at their own pace<br/>\nwhile spending more quality time with their families.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMs. Eusibio insists that the results lauded by Christian Educators as<br/>\nsigns<br/>\nof Sunday school success-such as high rates of scripture memorization and<br/>\nthe ability to identify flannel cutouts of major Bible characters-are<br/>\nindications of conformity, not evidence of actual learning. &quot;Traditional<br/>\nSunday school may seem to be a great success, but most of these kids<br/>\nare not<br/>\nreally learning; they&#39;re just doing well at standardized Bible quizzing!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNot so, says Harriett Petsche, Director of Christian Education for the<br/>\nUnited Methodist Church, who considers home Sunday schooling a dangerous<br/>\ntrend that she says &quot;threatens the future of Sunday School as we know it.&quot;<br/>\nAccording to Ms. Petsche, success at competitive exercises such as<br/>\nmemorization and Bible quizzing correlates to a deeper understanding of<br/>\nscripture. &quot;Children in a structured curriculum can often recite very long<br/>\nportions of scripture without even thinking about it. That&#39;s what I&#39;d call<br/>\n&#39;allowing the word of Christ to dwell in you richly.&#39; &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe attraction of home-based Christian education won over Neva and Allan<br/>\nMagrath in 2003, when they began home Sunday schooling their two daughters<br/>\nErika and Ellen, ages 7 and 10 respectively. &quot;Erika was having some<br/>\ntrouble<br/>\nwith a Sunday schoolyard bully, and Ellen had severe allergic reactions to<br/>\nthe combination of Oreos and orange juice from concentrate,&quot; recalled Mr.<br/>\nMagrath. &quot;It got to the point where the girls just dreaded getting dressed<br/>\non Sunday mornings. So we agreed to try this for a year, and we all<br/>\nlove it.<br/>\nNow we sleep in an hour later on Sundays, and we all study Bible stories<br/>\ntogether in our pajamas. Or sometimes we just have pancakes and skip the<br/>\nstories.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt hasn&#39;t been all fun for the Magrath family, however. They say they&#39;ve<br/>\nreceived harassing phone calls from the Sunday school president at their<br/>\nchurch, whose name they declined to disclose. Even their friends from the<br/>\nadult Bible study they attend have expressed concern over the decision to<br/>\npull Erika and Ellen out of Sunday School.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut despite the criticism they&#39;ve received, the Magraths say they are<br/>\nquite<br/>\ncontent with their current arrangement. In fact, they&#39;re contemplating<br/>\nbroadening their domestication of the church experience. &quot;Now that we&#39;re<br/>\nhome Sunday schooling, we&#39;re considering just home churching while<br/>\nwe&#39;re at<br/>\nit,&quot; says Ms. Magrath. &quot;We ordered some sermon tapes from Willow Creek and<br/>\nsome got some worship CDs at the local Provident store. &quot;We&#39;re just trying<br/>\nto decide which media ministry to send our tithe check to, and then<br/>\nwe&#39;ll be<br/>\nall set.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"designarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Mothers and no sense of humor.","postDate":"1095102963","msgId":20763,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMzUwMWM0OTlhMyRmNTU0N2I1MCRmNGQ4ZmVhOUBqYW5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":20752,"nextInTopic":20779,"prevInTime":20762,"nextInTime":20764,"topicId":20752,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1495215793\">&lt;&lt;&lt;This is her reply:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy church certainly doesn&#39;t fit that bill.
