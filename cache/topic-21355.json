Our son is 10 and has never been<br/>\nto school. At about our third year of having to notify the local school, I<br/>\ncame across Always Learning - WOW! love you all! you have all helped me<br/>\nthrough quite a few stressful times, thanks for all your wisdom.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone is interested in wolves, we found an interesting site:<br/>\nInternational Wolf Center  www.wolf.org very cool, it has 3 cameras that<br/>\nthey refresh every minute to see the wolves on the compound. We adopted one<br/>\nof the older wolves, so our son is very excited about that. All I know about<br/>\nthe facility is what is on the website.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to respond to the Halo 2 thread because we enjoy online gaming and<br/>\nmy husband and son just started playing Halo 2 online.  They&#39;d love to play<br/>\nwith other unschoolers, since the general open areas seem to have a sizable<br/>\ncontingent of people that are not very nice, to say the least.  My hubby and<br/>\nI also play Everquest, Ayonae Ro server, we&#39;d love to hear from anyone that<br/>\nwould want to play with us there.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, happy new year to all!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCris Kenski</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21354,"nextTopicId":21357}}
