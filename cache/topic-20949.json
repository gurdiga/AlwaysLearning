They do it as an explative sometimes<br/>\n(when they are mad or whatever) or sometimes just<br/>\nmixed causally in their speech.  Sometimes they use<br/>\nthe words wrong, or in odd combinations, which is<br/>\nalways amusing.  We encourage them not to do it away<br/>\nfrom home, because they don&#39;t know yet when and where<br/>\nit&#39;s appropriate.  Sometimes if I get tired of it<br/>\nbecause they are doing it a lot at a certain time, I<br/>\njust say &quot;hey, could you tone down the swearing a bit,<br/>\nI am getting tired of it right now.&quot;  It&#39;s always as a<br/>\npart of their speech though, not just swearing to be<br/>\nswearing.  They are not fascinated or attached to the<br/>\nwords themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nOften they don&#39;t swear at all for days or weeks, it<br/>\njust depends.  If adults are swearing more aound them,<br/>\nthey will swear more.  They also &quot;get&quot; the witty<br/>\nalmost swear jokes in books and movies (like Shit-ake<br/>\nmushrooms from the Spy Kids movies.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t attach value to the words, we just let them<br/>\nknow that they are considered strong impact words and<br/>\nwe talk about meanings if they want to know.  One of<br/>\nthem swore around their grandparents during a camping<br/>\ntrip this summer.  From the reaction they got, I doubt<br/>\nthey will do it around their grandparents again any<br/>\ntime soon, not that we see them a lot anyways.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy boys are 6 and almost 8, by the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20914,"nextTopicId":20915}}
