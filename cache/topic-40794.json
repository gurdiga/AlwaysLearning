Even if you see the pictures, it  <br/>\nlooks like there&#39;s some trick and you&#39;re not really seeing rocks  <br/>\nbalanced on their tips on top of each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you can watch a video:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZItqAdaYPQM\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZItqAdaYPQM</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not a trick though it takes patience and trying it out. Bill  <br/>\nDan&#39;s not the only one who can do it. The skill has been practiced  <br/>\nfor quite a while. It&#39;s called rock balancing:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_balancing\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_balancing</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you know it *can* be done, then with patience and determination  <br/>\nyou can figure out how to do it too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt struck me as I was looking through the images and watching the  <br/>\nvideos, that rock balancing is like unschooling and mindful  <br/>\nparenting. Viewed through the impossible lenses of school and  <br/>\nconventional parenting it seems impossible. But once you see it being  <br/>\ndone, through lists and conferences in real life friends, it can give  <br/>\nyou the confidence to actually do it yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[{"url":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZItqAdaYPQM?wmode=opaque","type":"VIDEO"}]}],"prevTopicId":40787,"nextTopicId":40809}}
