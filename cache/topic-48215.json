I never realized that this was something that other kids went through.  I can clearly remember being ten years old and at night I would be having near panick attacks and crying for this very reason.  My mother thought that I must be having trouble at school so she had my teacher ( a middle aged man who I had absolutely no rapport with - eek)  take me out of the classroom to talk to me.  Needless to say I stifled my cries for the next while for fear that I&#39;d have to talk to the teacher again.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMel</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48209,"nextTopicId":48218}}
