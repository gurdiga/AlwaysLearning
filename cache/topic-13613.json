(If I were brave and have asked the doctor to do 5 stiches<br/>\ninstead, would have saved me worries as after I took the stiches off 7 days<br/>\nlater, we saw blood coming out the next morning.  It was on Saturday and the<br/>\nemergency room of that small city hospital were full.  I thought that our<br/>\ncase were not that &quot;emergency&quot;.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAny way the doctor only prescribe soap.  Only soap?  No antibiotics cream,<br/>\nno disinfectant? No, the doctor said; &quot;just wash the area with soap every<br/>\nday&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nA friend, and neighbor that is a nurse told me the wonder of the aloe to<br/>\n&quot;seal&quot; the wound/cut.  I tried it.  I would cut the aloe and spread that<br/>\nsticky fluid over the cut.  IT REALLY WORKED.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the 8th day after the emergency room visit, mother, sister, dd and I were<br/>\nat the beach. The week long vacation were just beginning.  7 days fm that,<br/>\nanybody did not have to guess hard to see that we had been on a vacation.<br/>\n<br/>\nlove and peace</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13318,"nextTopicId":13561}}
