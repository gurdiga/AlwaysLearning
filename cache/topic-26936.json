I was trained not to trust myself.  I&#39;ve <br/>\nhad to relearn that.  When I said I wanted x or y, I was told I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want that, I wanted z. So for me, just to identify what <br/>\nexactly I DO want is work and then to communicate it directly (as <br/>\nyou westerners do) instead of the eastern passive-agressive mode <br/>\n(southerns are more direct than mid-atlantic and north!) was a great <br/>\nstretch for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nNVC helps me be clear, direct and not attacking, belittling or <br/>\nunderhanded, all communication techniques designed to get someone <br/>\nwhat they want, not designed to build relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve seen NVC used as a club, personally.  I&#39;ve seen it used to <br/>\n&gt; tell  others that they&#39;re using jackal language (or whatever), to <br/>\n&gt; criticize them for not having GUESSED how the NVC people think<br/>\n&gt; others should communicate.  It seems to me to be making up rules <br/>\n&gt; to use in an environment in which there are already traditions and <br/>\n&gt; courtesies in place.   Unless everyone in a family, or a club, or <br/>\n&gt; a church, or a  neighborhood, agrees that they will ALL &quot;be NVC&quot; <br/>\n&gt; then those who don&#39;t learn those dialogs are considered to be <br/>\n&gt; rude, it seems.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I certainly wouldn&#39;t apply it that way, but I could see that other <br/>\npeople will.  People can use anything as a weapon, even NVC.<br/>\n<br/>\nReligion has certainly made an excellent weapon over the years.  <br/>\nPreaching tolerance and being intolerant.  Preaching acceptance and <br/>\nnot accepting.  That doesn&#39;t mean the concepts are wrong, just that <br/>\nthe people applying them have cruel or mean motives.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Does it work if only one person is doing it?  Can it be a solo <br/>\n&gt; pursuit?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes.  I thought I had explained that, but perhaps not clearly.<br/>\n<br/>\nViewing the world through a lens that sees every person&#39;s actions as <br/>\na reflection of their own needs can let one be more sensitive and <br/>\ntolerant of others.<br/>\n<br/>\nNVC can be practiced alone in helping one determine how &#39;best&#39; to <br/>\ncommunicate with others.  NVC is simply another tool in the box.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; All in all, it&#39;s only communication.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which is pretty important.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Unschooling involves all aspects of life, not just communication.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, just a tool on the path.

Broadness of base.  Expansion of scope, not narrow-<br/>\n&gt; beam  vision.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not where I am coming from.  For instance, for me, the &#39;goal&#39; of <br/>\nunschooling or RU in our house is happy children, happy family.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t see &#39;unschooling&#39; itself as a goal. I can only see it as a <br/>\nprocess to getting to a different goal, such as producing happy, <br/>\nconfident, comfortable people.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s where I think I was having my problem.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you say &#39;unschooling is the goal&#39; then it seems you are <br/>\ntreating it as a product and not a process.  I think we agree that <br/>\nit&#39;s a process and so maybe it&#39;s just the terminology or use of the <br/>\nword that is confusing to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI already bought a copy of your Peaceful Parenting tape.  :)  I&#39;m <br/>\ngoing to use Richie&#39;s Kareoke machine to listen to it. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI did listen to Big Noisy Peace and it was interesting, but I&#39;m <br/>\nthinking I will get more out of the Peaceful Parenting tape, <br/>\nalthough for me, I prefer to read, so edited transcripts, websites <br/>\nand books are my favorite. :)  I did already buy Moving a Puddle <br/>\nbefore you ask! :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; people go through levels of  <br/>\n&gt; understanding and receptiveness, and some things that are there<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t make sense to some people.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, we all have ways that things make sense to us. :)  When I do <br/>\ncomputer training, I often have to explain something two or three <br/>\nways until I see that click of comprehension in someone&#39;s eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s too bad there&#39;s no faster, better way to get it, but there we <br/>\ngo.  All being human, I suppose.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The process of knowing WHY one is unschooling is part of  <br/>\n&gt; unschooling.  The first simple &quot;She hates school&quot; won&#39;t serve to  <br/>\n&gt; support and  maintain ten years of parental involvement.  New <br/>\n&gt; motives and underpinnings need to be seen and embraced all along <br/>\n&gt; the way.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ah, interesting thoughts. Have you expounded on this somewhere on <br/>\nyour website?  It would be interesting to me to hear your shifting <br/>\nmovties and underpinnings throughout the years...<br/>\n<br/>\nI am very happy with my purpose of growing happy, confident kids, <br/>\nbut I&#39;m always interested to hear what other purposes and goals may <br/>\nbe out there on the unschooling road. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nc.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Unschooling as a Product","postDate":"1158436770","msgId":26963,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg4NEU0QUM3LTg5MEUtNEQ5Ri05Q0QyLUIzNkUyRUFBMTZBNUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGVlaGpxcStsbGtwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGVlaGpxcStsbGtwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":26962,"nextInTopic":26964,"prevInTime":26962,"nextInTime":26964,"topicId":26936,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I see more similariy between RU and NVC than I do between unschooling and any other homeschooling philosophy.-=- Still, why does it have be be compared?

Or would&#39;ve been, but one of my spots was given to  <br/>\nsomeone else, so I combined the intermediate into the other two and  <br/>\nit wasn&#39;t as clearly done.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few people (the same small few who squawk periodically, whose  <br/>\nsquawking has caused other problems in the past, such as the closing  <br/>\nof the unschooling.com message boards) seem to want others to think  <br/>\nthere is no such thing as advanced unschooling, that unschooling is  <br/>\neasy to understand, just don&#39;t use a curriculum, that&#39;s all, no more,  <br/>\nthere are no experts, there&#39;s nothing to know, and no one can tell  <br/>\nyou you can&#39;t do it or that you could do it better.  WHY they would  <br/>\nwant others to think that I don&#39;t know, unless they like to think  <br/>\nthey know as much about it as anyone, as much as anyone possibly could.<br/>\n<br/>\nMe, though, I&#39;ve seen people do it for a few years and get stuck or  <br/>\nback out, because there were things they hadn&#39;t thought of, or they  <br/>\nhad bought into some claim that it was fine for little kids but not  <br/>\nolder kids.  I&#39;ve seen people try it and fail because the  <br/>\norganization of their home was more important than learning, and they  <br/>\nreally NEEDED (they felt) to have the kids in school so they could  <br/>\nclean the house every day without kids around.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe process of knowing WHY one is unschooling is part of  <br/>\nunschooling.  The first simple &quot;She hates school&quot; won&#39;t serve to  <br/>\nsupport and  maintain ten years of parental involvement.  New motives  <br/>\nand underpinnings need to be seen and embraced all along the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Unschooling as a Product","postDate":"1158420840","msgId":26956,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ2OThFQUYzLTk0QUMtNEYyMC05RTlDLUE2Q0ZFRjA4OEUwMEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGVlZ2ZkNCtnZGluQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGVlZ2ZkNCtnZGluQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":26950,"nextInTopic":26957,"prevInTime":26955,"nextInTime":26957,"topicId":26936,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-No literalness as in do this and that will happen .

Their primary process is to gain readership,  <br/>\npaid or otherwise.  Numbers DO count, because they need stats to show  <br/>\nadvertisers, and because the publishers have mortgages and car payments.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a situation like Joyce&#39;s page, or mine, we don&#39;t have to  <br/>\ncompromise or give equal time to another philosophy, because we&#39;re  <br/>\ngiving information away at our own expense, not at the expense of  <br/>\nglossy-full-page-international-advertising.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think magazines can be great, because not everyone has the  <br/>\ninternet, and it&#39;s a way for people who prefer print media or depend  <br/>\non it to get some current inspiration, and also some awareness of  <br/>\nwhat resources they COULD buy or can buy if they want to.  And lots  <br/>\nof the things advertised are just fun music and toy and art things.   <br/>\nThat&#39;s cool.  But still, advertisers get opinions about content and  <br/>\nthey can vote with their feet (figuratively speaking).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my volunteer time has to do with process of ideas, or parenting,  <br/>\nof inspiring people and pointing out where things look like shaky  <br/>\njustifications.

But it was fun, and I kept on, and was  <br/>\ninvited to speak and I started meeting more families I really liked.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey can&#39;t take that away from me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen AOL&#39;s homeschooling forum went small and stunted and was run by  <br/>\npeople who weren&#39;t even homeschoolers, and a great deal of what we  <br/>\nused to be able to get to was gone, I realized that  I really wanted  <br/>\nto find ways to make the good stuff available.  So I experimented  <br/>\nwith various little free webpages (some of them are still out there  <br/>\nbecause they provided no way at all to delete the pages), and  <br/>\neventually got a good site where I could collect things.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey can&#39;t take that away from me.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth yahoogroups and googlegroups provide simple ways to create and  <br/>\nmaintain discussion lists which people can read by e-mail, digest-by- <br/>\ne-mail, or at the websites.  I&#39;ve kept this list for nearly five  <br/>\nyears, and UnschoolingDiscussion, whose name and ownership have  <br/>\nchanged a few times, is old now, seven and a half years old now (and  <br/>\nmoved to googlegroups).<br/>\n<br/>\nThey can&#39;t take that away.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet there are a few people, a handful, who WANT to take those things,  <br/>\nor change them, or claim them.<br/>\nThey can&#39;t.<br/>\nThey can&#39;t have my birthday.<br/>\nThey can&#39;t have my husband.<br/>\nThey can&#39;t have my computer, even.<br/>\nThey can&#39;t be me.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-They and their kids are a team, and if one side loses,<br/>\nthe whole team loses.
