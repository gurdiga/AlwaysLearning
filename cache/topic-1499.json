But when I knew the characters better and saw the whole episode <br/>\nthrough it&#39;s deeply, disturbingly funny.   South Park makes fun of the depths <br/>\nof teacher/student/parent/child/neighbor relations, the psychology we&#39;re all <br/>\ntaught about them (even when it&#39;s transparently untrue, but we keep acting on <br/>\nit), on Jewish/Christian relationships, on political correctness, <br/>\ninternational relations, what kids know about sex even though parents love to <br/>\nthink they know nothing, <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause we don&#39;t have cable, I see older episodes on video or DVD, or at a <br/>\nfriend&#39;s house, or someone brings something by.  But I&#39;m not worried about <br/>\nit, because eventually I&#39;ll see all of it twice.  I&#39;m not in a hurry.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Christmas I got the complete Monty Python&#39;s Flying Circus, on 14 DVDs, in <br/>\na box.  WOW!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was younger I didn&#39;t get it.  I thought most of it was crummy and <br/>\ninsipid.  I did love The Holy Grail, but it&#39;s because I knew enough to get <br/>\nthe jokes.  As years went by and I knew more about England and British TV <br/>\n(which is crummy and insipid lots of times), I appreciate it more.  And being <br/>\none of the first American Ali G fans (trying to force my friends to watch <br/>\n&quot;Innit&quot; a year and a half ago, and having a translated copy of &quot;Aiiieee,&quot; I <br/>\nlook at MP&#39;s Flying Circus in that light now.   I used to think it was gross <br/>\nthat they&#39;d dress like women so much.  It&#39;s not so common in American <br/>\ntradition, and when it does happen, like Geraldine (by Flip Wilson), the <br/>\nwoman seems more likely to be smart and strong, not dippy and confused.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut now I&#39;m looking at skits I had never seen before and really appreciating <br/>\nthem, and some I had seen before and thinking &quot;OH, now I get it.  Plus <br/>\nthere&#39;s Terry Jones stuff (each DVD has a &quot;meet the players&quot; feature), and <br/>\nsome live-on-stage film (which Terry Jones is in, those I&#39;ve seen).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Christmas I got Marty a South Park calendar, a &quot;Timmy and the Lords of <br/>\nthe Underworld&quot; concert t-shirt (South Park joke) and a &quot;can of Duff beer&quot; (a <br/>\ncan with a removeable top containing a pack of Simpson&#39;s playing cards), <br/>\namong other less controversial M.C. Escher and construction-set-type things.  <br/>\nAnd he got a high-in-the-line Leatherman and a Zelda pocket watch in his <br/>\nstocking.  More manly stuff this year.<br/>\n<br/>\nI encourage toilet humor in my kids.  Either they get it out of their <br/>\nsystems, or they become businessmen selling it to others who will never get <br/>\nit out of their (ahem...) systems.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Helen Keller, the Musical,&quot; is funny.
