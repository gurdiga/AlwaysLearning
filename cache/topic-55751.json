As in she doesn&#39;t take naps anymore, so she&#39;s up later naturally, and she&#39;s refusing to wear a diaper at night or taking it off? If either of those are something you&#39;ve initiated, then it might be a good idea to back off from that! <br/>\n<br/>\nBut if those are both things she&#39;s wanting and doing naturally, its time for you and your dh to start adapting. There&#39;s no magic timeline for how kids transition away from naps and there&#39;s no mangic formula for kids sleeping through the night - assume you&#39;re dealing with a &quot;transition&quot; that could take a year or more! The kinds of stop-gap solutions that get you through a few rough weeks won&#39;t work over that kind of time span.<br/>\n<br/>\nChange the availability of beverages in the evening so she doesn&#39;t need to pee in the night. Also look into something like a matress pad and ask if she&#39;d be okay just peeing in bed for now. The &quot;getting up&quot; part can be enough for the body to shift from sleepy mode to awake mode - in my own life I try to set myself up so I don&#39;t have to get up to pee for that very reason, it can take me hours to drop off again.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf those don&#39;t help and she&#39;s awake at night (and some kids go through phases of being up at night, even toddlers) you find ways to cope. It doesn&#39;t seem like getting her back to sleep works very well, so step away from that strategy and look for ways to make her safe while she&#39;s awake - a play-pen, a shut door, whatever works for y&#39;all. You look for things she can do awake by herself that don&#39;t keep others up - quiet toys, mellow movies, whatever. If one of you can stay up, by all means do, but with enough sleep deprivation, staying up can stop being a safe option. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlternately, you can look for ways to nap in the daytime - you specifically, I mean, if she&#39;s not napping - but those may involve the same sorts of strategies: find a way for her to be safe so you can catch some shut eye. A friend of mine used to lie down across the doorway to the (kid-safe) living-room to nap so that when her toddler would have to climb over her to get out she could wake up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; not set a bedtime since she was 13 months <br/>\n&gt; old<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What does that mean, &quot;set a bedtime&quot;? If it means there&#39;s no family ritual of settling in to sleep, it might help to have one!

Our family has had 5 years, and counting, of musical beds, sometimes changing nightly, weekly, and/or monthly--whatever is getting us all the most sleep.  Both of my boys seemed to go through a phase of light sleeping when they were around this age and it lasted about 6 months for each one.  The only thing that consistently worked was for the kid to sleep alone with the parent least likely to need to get up in the middle of the night or very early in the morning.  So, if you&#39;re willing to sleep separately for a while, it may help.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an aside: My husband and I slept in the same bed, alone all week for the first time in 5 years.  Strange that it felt a little strange at first! Currently, one of us lays down with the boys until they are asleep or close enough and the other rocks the baby down (Audrey just transitioned, pretty much on her own choosing, from full time cosleeping and on demand nursing to sleeping all night and seeming to wean). Who knows how long this arrangement will last, and my husband and I may be night time separated again for a while, but it&#39;s nice for now. No bed time struggles, no tears, no fear, no sleep deprivation for 5 years and counting.<br/>\n<br/>\njulie<br/>\njames, 5 soon<br/>\ntyler, just turned 3<br/>\naudrey, 1 very soon!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, myung-jin kang &lt;mkangj@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi Everyone,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My daughter is in a transition of dropping her nap and also being diaper free at <br/>\n&gt; night time.

Maybe that would make it easier for her to sleep during the night.
