I think clearer is that kids make choices they believe will meet a want or need. Each time they experience a choice they&#39;ve made, they learn more about themselves, about what they like and don&#39;t like, how the world works, and they get better at making decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey will often experience more of how the world works from the choices that aren&#39;t perfect.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My oldest daughter is very happy but when we get around other people she acts<br/>\n&gt; very differently.

It&#39;s more likely acceptance that she&#39;s looking for. If she has more people to interact with, then she&#39;ll have less need of their acceptance. Give her plenty of options to explore, especially getting her around other kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe goth or emo or whatever look could be her exploring a way of viewing the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nCutting can be a reaction to having had to pretend thoughts and feelings that the parent wants the child to have. If you have the habit of telling her she&#39;s wrong to think a certain way about things or people, that what she likes or doesn&#39;t like is wrong, she&#39;s had to stuff down who she really is to put on the face you&#39;re trying to get her to put on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she says she doesn&#39;t like one of her siblings, how do you react?

So questions have come up that I am struggling withas a result of my research. So heres a bit of background. My family consists of my husband, myself and our 3 girls ages 12, 10 &6. We pulled our kids out of PS in november because they were being verbally abused by staff and peers. My biggest concern has always been for my oldest daughter who often gravitates toward people who berate or belittle her. Since we began first with homeschooling I found myself in a constant struggle to get her to do anything school like. I spoke with a local support group who suggested deschooling. That was a few months ago. Since then I have found myself really loving the idea of unschooling. It is a change in the way we think and look at the world. I have found though that I tend to gravitate back to an authoritarian parenting style when I dont get my way or the kids dont do what I feel is appropriate at any given time :( I am working on this and I am catching myself more often so that is a plus. My main question is I have read that unschooling is about giving choices and trusting your kids to make choices that are best for them. My oldest daughter is very happy but when we get around other people she acts very differently. She wears black makeup and acts very dark. She has even gone as far as cutting herself with a thumbtack as a way of getting attention from her peers. We have talked to her about the dangers involved with this behavior and told her how much we love her but I am scared to be quite honest. How do I trust her and give her freedom when she may be hurting herself? Also how do I get her to understand that she will be loved and accepted for who she is without all the drama? Then, is this who she is? Am I not allowing her to be herself by telling her this not okay with me? Im so lost! I have taken away her makeup and her attitude has gotten better but I really feel conflicted I want to allow her to express herself with makeup but when she does I have a hard time accepting who she becomes.
