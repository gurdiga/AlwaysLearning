Iowa. The Omish  school in  kolona, Iowa <br/>\n(Wasinton Co.) will  let you use them as the teacher to over look(as <br/>\nin  ok u come to  a few of our homeschool outing with group and we <br/>\nsee her with you) as long as they see the kid a few times a year and <br/>\ndo it at no cost and  will let you take them on there outings and <br/>\nteach  how to make a day at the park  credited. and how to write it <br/>\nup for the system. and she told me  look I only been doing this a  <br/>\nschool year but I think like you if the school is only offering her <br/>\nridacule no help and begging you to put her on drugs maybe  you need <br/>\nto fight the system. she still has 2 in school and  one in my <br/>\ndaughters class and  said you need to get her out!!! Fire the  <br/>\ncounsler and the school!(gee think i felt that and have herd it from <br/>\nso many here) and  then she rembered she was addopted and  said i <br/>\nneed to find out about Iowa law is she mine  or is she going to be <br/>\nunder what they want?<br/>\n I think it like any adoption. and should be ok.<br/>\nI got a phone call from princable today  with lisa and girls making <br/>\nher cry ext.  and oh by the way  she is behind in such and such. I <br/>\nshocked him told him look I will give Lisa the opertuinty if she <br/>\nwants to go back to school and finish this year out. If not I will <br/>\ncome get the papers in am. and as for her failing  I belive it is you <br/>\nthat have failed her, He asked do I intened to open enroll her or <br/>\ndual inroll her I told him I will make that dession after I talked to <br/>\nmy daughter. He told me i needed to talk to superintendent when i <br/>\ncome get the papers.<br/>\nWhen my daughter came home we had a long dission on it and the spring <br/>\nmusic consert is tommorow and  she wants to finish out the year  it <br/>\nis ony  a lil over 2 weeks. then  she wants to  not go back . we <br/>\ntalked about how it is the school failing and not her and that she <br/>\nwould be spending her time with mom and not at a desk. and can she <br/>\nlearn more about cooking and can she  do a experment on what   helps <br/>\nplants grow in the yard and can she read whet she wants and oh mom <br/>\ncan we go to cedar rapids some time  and do the sience musem, and mom <br/>\ncan I still babysit? and can we not quit school  at least till after <br/>\nmy birthday (have a  free certific  for a limo to pick her and her <br/>\nfriends up for her birthday party)<br/>\na few days on this list have lifted  so much from my heart and made <br/>\nme feel like yes  I can do this and all it will take is the willness <br/>\nto unlearn for me and the love her and I  have.<br/>\nI have a feeling i will need you all more in the times coming and yes <br/>\ni promise to get book mentioned on frount of this  group page as soon <br/>\nas I can budget it.<br/>\nI also want to say thank you  from my lil Lisa as she thanked me! <br/>\nand  she feels like  this is the answer she had a few questions on <br/>\nhow to and what if  but I  assured her it will work and we will be <br/>\nfine and she can still be anything she wants to be in life.<br/>\n  so as a huge weight has been lifted  from me I thank you  and as I  <br/>\nhave my doubts and  battles I hope this list will still be here. when <br/>\nI started posting  here someone hinted this may not be be a good <br/>\nbegaining place for me it is the best beginning one can hope for. <br/>\nnext is all the legal stuff and so forth I am sure.<br/>\nI belive we are on our way to healing and to life and  again I thank <br/>\nyou for your guidence and your guidence and support in the future.<br/>\nDee</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17725,"nextTopicId":17726}}
