Only about <br/>\nthe idea of adults in general being amused by crying children*** <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n1. It&#39;s NOT major. I know my child and I am not minimizing her emotions <br/>\njust because they aren&#39;t physical pain. If it was major, the crying <br/>\nwould go on for a lot longer and she would want to be held, snuggled, <br/>\netc. This is just MINOR frustration, disappointment that she prefers to <br/>\nwork out on her own. I am totally there for her 110%.<br/>\n<br/>\n****In my last post I mentioned that it may very well be major to the person <br/>\nwho is crying because when that rush of emotion comes, it may come hard and <br/>\nfast and strong. Maybe, on the idea that there are different levels of <br/>\ndisappointment to little tiny people, we&#39;ll have to understand that we have different <br/>\nbeliefs. We never WILL know that answer becasue most of the humans on the <br/>\nplanet can&#39;t really understand and conceptualize what is going on inside another <br/>\nhuman, can they?*****<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Perhaps you missed the beginning of the thread, but the whole reason <br/>\nwhy I mentioned DH finding this amusing in the first place was because I <br/>\ncautioned him not to laugh. Because it doesn&#39;t happen every time, just <br/>\nsometimes. <br/>\n<br/>\n***for others reading this thread, who may be reading with the realization <br/>\nthat a similar issue has gone on in their house, I want to say that sometimes <br/>\ncan be too often.****<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s not unfeeling or lacking in compassion. Neither am I.<br/>\n3. We treat each other with compassion in this family and we are setting <br/>\na very good example in general for DD in the way we treat each other in <br/>\ngeneral on a day to day basis.
