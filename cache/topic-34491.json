We married young (21 and 22) and were both committed<br/>\nconverts to Christianity at the time we married.  We both went to church and<br/>\nhad deep faith experiences over the years.  One day (this year) my dh came<br/>\nto me and sheepishly told me that he had been reading and thinking a lot<br/>\nabout God and the universe and everything and had come to the conclusion<br/>\nthat he considers himself to be an atheist.  After the shock and some<br/>\ntearful, worried conversations (worried about our marriage and the kids and<br/>\nthe future mostly) I was convinced that his new point of view did not change<br/>\nour commitment to one another or to our marriage and that the fact that he<br/>\nhadn&#39;t wanted to hide this big change in his life from me was a good thing.<br/>\nThe respect that bathed all of the talks we had about how this might change<br/>\nour lives together as a family was very sweet and heartening.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that he had the courage to face this honestly and with respect for<br/>\nmy feelings gave me the push I needed to really give the possibility of no<br/>\nGod an honest hearing - something I hadn&#39;t done as an adult.  The short<br/>\nversion is that I too consider myself an atheist now and am wonderfully<br/>\nsurprised by the freedom of thought and fresh point of view this has given<br/>\nme.  This isn&#39;t the right list for the details but I think honesty and<br/>\nintegrity has helped and so has a healthy respect for each other and an<br/>\nagreement that living joyfully together was really really important.<br/>\nNeither one of us would want to split even if we didn&#39;t agree on matters of<br/>\nfaith because of the very real pain and suffering that divorce causes.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHope I haven&#39;t veered too far afield.

So, I did the research. As with all things Catholic, the Pagan roots<br/>\nof this term are purposely skewed with control through fear. Hel was a<br/>\nperfectly nice deity, though Odin found her &quot;hard to look at&quot; with her grey<br/>\nand pink slimy skin. As to not upset his good friend, Loki, he gave Hel and<br/>\nimportant (and joyfully invisible) job of transporting souls of those who<br/>\nhave died after an illness. She was connected to the underworld and dealt<br/>\nwith souls of sick people -- pretty easy to understand why folks were scared<br/>\nof Hel. To curse someone with &quot;Go to Hel(l)&quot; is truly a wish of cancer or<br/>\npox upon them; a lingering illness followed by death.<br/>\nThat helped put a lot of &quot;fire and brimstone&quot; rhetoric to rest. And since<br/>\nMitch died of cancer, he just may have gone to Hel; for care and transport<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Couple that with an abusive, manipulative, controlling mother and you can<br/>\n&gt; bet I&#39;ve got lots of hang-ups.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unschooling brings the opportunity to not pass these qualities to our<br/>\nchildren. Even better, the process of *actively* NOT being that mom is the<br/>\nbest healing for having *had* that mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this a typical thing to go through as an unschooling parent? Did most of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; you at some point begin questioning your belief system?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would say yes. The questioning, like anything else in this human life,<br/>\ncannot be limited, fenced or  hindered. The whole wide world is open to<br/>\nexploration and question. If God can&#39;t handle our questioning, who can??<br/>\n::bg:: I&#39;m doing a circle chat later this month on this very topic, it&#39;s<br/>\nnear and dear to me. I think I&#39;ve got my whole life to figure out this human<br/>\nexistence and anything that may be beyond this physicality. If there is a<br/>\nGod and indeed I am created in God&#39;s image, then this is a God Approved<br/>\nJourney. I am diana, this is what God has wrought; questions, demands,<br/>\ntantrums, gratitude and all :)<br/>\nI&#39;ve read the most amazing books :) Foremost, the first three Conversations<br/>\nwith God. Wow, wow, wow. A gigantic shift in perspective for me. Lamb: The<br/>\nGospel According to Biff, Christ&#39;s Childhood Pal. The funniest Jesus you&#39;ll<br/>\never meet. Likable and believable. I can strive to emulate this guy :) And:<br/>\nThe Four Agreements. The Journey Home. The Moon Under Her Feet. The Harlot<br/>\nby the Side of the Road. The Red Tent. Jesus, Who Needs Him?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow did you deal with the guilt (I have such a tremendous amount right now)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and the fear of doing the wrong thing and landing yourself in Hell?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Would God really be so scared of your exploration that  you would be<br/>\ncondemned to hell? Really? I&#39;d recommend you try on the idea that mayhap you<br/>\nwere created to explore what it means to be human and have a relationship<br/>\nwith God that is uniquely your own. You have free will. You know the<br/>\nprinciples by which to lead a good life. Is there room in your heart for<br/>\nFear? Were you created to be filled with Fear or Love? You can&#39;t have one<br/>\nwhere the other exists. If God is Love, Fear is not God. Free yourself from<br/>\nfear, it&#39;s glorious!<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried talking to my husband, but it frankly scares him to hear me talk in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; such a way. He thinks I should just quit thinking about it and go on to<br/>\n&gt; church and leave things alone. I wouldn&#39;t dare talk to my mother-in-law. Not<br/>\n&gt; only would she have a major cow, she would worry herself sick that I was<br/>\n&gt; leading her son and her grandchildren astray. My mother is out of the<br/>\n&gt; question as is anyone in our congregation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Your relationship with God is your own; you answer only for yourself. You<br/>\ncan question your path and still have faith. You can question the rules and<br/>\nstill uphold the principles.<br/>\nI found ways to be Catholic and truly *love* being Catholic; I questioned<br/>\neverything & I knew the story behind the stories told, the original purpose<br/>\nto rites and rituals, the principles behind the dogma. I still do love the<br/>\nCatholic Faith *and* I will not support the actions and politics of the<br/>\nCatholic Church - so I&#39;m not Catholic anymore.  I know my relationship with<br/>\nmy version of God is a good one. Come that day, that&#39;s all I&#39;ll have to<br/>\nanswer for.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still know in my heart that I am a Christian, but things just don&#39;t seem<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; right anymore. Somehow, I don&#39;t think that Jesus would approve of what<br/>\n&gt; churches have become and how manipulative and conrolling they are.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What would Jesus do?<br/>\nI think he questioned it ALL :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhew! I kinda went nuts there, I hope some of it is helpful to someone else,<br/>\nit was incredibly cathartic to write it down :)<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~diana :)<br/>\nxoxoxoxo<br/>\nhannahbearski.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":125460203,"authorName":"Janet Renk","from":"&quot;Janet Renk&quot; &lt;jrenk@...&gt;","profile":"mimmyof5","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Fear  of Hell (was Humanism)","postDate":"1210254130","msgId":34696,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMmQwMWM4YjExMSQ1MjBmOGI5MCQzZmUzZmUwNEB5b3VyOTRlODI2YjEyMj4=","referencesHeader":"PDI2NDdDNkFDLTk5QzctNDI2Ny1CNTNELUFFQjYxRjgxM0JEREBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPGZ2cjQways4NGNhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MDExODAxYzhiMDIxJGVmYjNkYTkwJGNmMWI4ZmIwJEBmMnMuY29tPiA8NzQ0RkYzRTctREVFRi00MzU0LUIxNkEtQUY4OTMyM0MzM0Y2QHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":34684,"nextInTopic":34699,"prevInTime":34695,"nextInTime":34697,"topicId":34491,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1478726793\">&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s at all reasonable to risk a marriage.

I mentioned in my other e-mail that my husband isn&#39;t where I am with a belief system.  Because of voices from his childhood that he can&#39;t shake or whatever, he is still with the religion program.  He has many, many questions, but he will have to deal with those in his own way, in his own time.  Anyway, for him he still feels it&#39;s his responsibility to raise his children with a belief system.  When they&#39;re grown, if they move away from church, he sees that as their decision.  But right now he feels responsible for sharing this with them.  He knows I don&#39;t believe.  But I&#39;m not willing to split up this family over religion.  There have been too many broken families and wars over religion already.  Plus when we married, we both came into the marriage with the same beliefs.  I&#39;m the one that has changed.  But my marriage is much more important to me and my children than drawing some line in the sand over religion.

And honestly, there&#39;s  <br/>\nthe question of breach of contract, in a marriage, if at the point of  <br/>\nthe marriage they&#39;re both very Christian, and the marriage is based  <br/>\nin that belief.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t believe in heaven OR hell, but I see the crushing effects of  <br/>\ndivorce in young adults all around me.

Did <br/>\n  most of you at some point begin questioning your belief system? How <br/>\n  did you deal with the guilt (I have such a tremendous amount right now) <br/>\n  and the fear of doing the wrong thing and landing yourself in Hell?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Unschooling, for me, has been the open door/path to many improvements in my life.  While I first started exploring and implementing unschooling because it meshed with our parenting philosophy, it opened so many other doors that have provided many benefits.  Unschooling helped my husband and me in our marriage (without paying a counselor), it helped us as a family, it helped me to accept myself and the biggest thing of all, as I learned to trust my children I learned to trust myself.  And that finally gave me the courage to ask those very tough, frightening question and look within myself for answers.  I&#39;ve been going through a long period of deconstructing my faith, and for the first time I can recall, I&#39;m at peace.  And it did start with unschooling.  I would think that other people have had the same experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t know what to say to you about feeling guilt.  In my experience, guilt is part of the religious experience.  As you keep questioning and learning to listen to yourself, I think that feeling of guilt will go away and you will find peace.  For me peace came from listening to myself.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My dh isn&#39;t exactly on the same page with me, either.  While he has most of the same questions I do, he&#39;s not one to rock the boat and is more apt to remain status quo.  I think it helps when you have someone to talk with.  Do you have a friend who is open to listening to you talk about faith, and not one who is going to try to convert you?  When I started questioning Christianity and religion, most of my women friends started praying for me, then vocally telling me the right thing - according to them - and finally, dropping my friendship.  So ultimately I was alone.  And maybe that was good because I had to listen to myself.  It&#39;s hard to clear out those old controlling voices when new voices are constantly filling your mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n  All this to say that I&#39;ve been where you are and am still working on all the baggage I&#39;ve been carrying around.  You can e-mail me if you have any questions just about religion and working through it.  I don&#39;t know how much help I would be, but it is good to have someone listen to you at times.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Janet<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":321729783,"authorName":"Angela Shaw","from":"&quot;Angela Shaw&quot; &lt;game-enthusiast@...&gt;","profile":"autonomousangela","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Fear  of Hell (was Humanism)","postDate":"1210160889","msgId":34663,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNTEwMWM4YjAzOCQzOGU5NGQxMCQ2NTAwYThjMEBFYm9ueT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGZ2cjZoNStuZjBvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":34662,"nextInTopic":34669,"prevInTime":34662,"nextInTime":34664,"topicId":34491,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Melissa wrote:  Oh Absoultely I did begin to question my belief system.

One of the books<br/>\nthat I read that helped me to sort out what I believed or did not believe<br/>\nwas &quot;Conversations With God&quot; by Neale Donald Walsch.  I found I certainly<br/>\ndidn&#39;t agree with everything he wrote but some of the questions he asked<br/>\nwere also questions I had and as I read the book and sorted out what I<br/>\nbelieved I came to feel a sense of peace with my own beliefs.  Ren said it<br/>\nwell.  Real Peace.  And it&#39;s a very cool place, for sure.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBefore I came to that place, I walked aroudn with a lot of guilt.  I wasn&#39;t<br/>\neven aware of how much guilt I was carrying until I let it all go and felt<br/>\nan enormous sense of peace.  I even sat down with my pastor and talked about<br/>\nthings that I felt were inconsistant between Christianity and just being a<br/>\ngood person and I was pleasantly surprised to find that she shared my ideas<br/>\neven though they were inconsistant with what a lot of us had been taught.<br/>\nShe said it was difficult to talk about some of these things in sermons<br/>\nbecause people don&#39;t take change well but that she tried in little ways to<br/>\nopen people&#39;s minds more and more without shaking their whole foundations.<br/>\nI stopped going to church at that point (probably 8 years ago) because I<br/>\nrealized that even though I enjoyed parts of it, I really went out of a<br/>\nsense of guilt.  I may attend a church again some day but for now it doesn&#39;t<br/>\nfit in my life and that&#39;s okay with me.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if there is a term that describes or sums up what I believe.<br/>\nI&#39;m sure I&#39;m not a Christian in most Christian&#39;s eyes but I do feel that God<br/>\nis part of this world in some way and I do believe that people who are able<br/>\nto give up their worries to some higher power (or just unburden themselves<br/>\nof them somehow) can feel more peaceful than those who carry too much<br/>\nbaggage around all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s funny, the only time I feel guilty about anything religion related is<br/>\nwhen I visit one relative who, if she knew how I felt, would carry the<br/>\nburden of worry for my soul.  I conceal what I believe when conversations<br/>\nturn toward religion because I feel like she carries enough guilt for us all<br/>\nand I don&#39;t want to place anymore burden on her.

Certainly, unschooling<br/>\nis one. Parelli horse training is another. A person begins by saying &quot;I want<br/>\nto apply this thing in this an area&quot; , but doesn&#39;t realise that the<br/>\napplication of the thing is going to result in a major paradigm shift that<br/>\nis going to affect many (all???) other areas of their living as well. So<br/>\nthey proceed to implement the initial decision, and then they become aware<br/>\nof the paradigm shift challenge, and find themselves at a crossroads of<br/>\nsorts. What now? For many it is too scary, too painful, to insecure to<br/>\ncontinue, and so they turn back. Sometimes the turning back is dramatic (&quot;I<br/>\ntried that and it doesn&#39;t work/is rubbish/is heresy/is dangerous&quot; or<br/>\nwhatever other trumped up excuse alleviates the stress...); sometimes it is<br/>\nwistful (&quot;I would have liked to have gone down that road but it is too<br/>\ndifficult/I don&#39;t have the time/I am too afraid to try/It is too hard to<br/>\nmake a change now&quot;). Sometimes there is a denial that there ever was a<br/>\nchoice made and turned back upon.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nFear is powerful. We are so afraid of consequences. School helped to teach<br/>\nus that the one thing you should never do is mess up. Don&#39;t fail. Don&#39;t make<br/>\nmistakes. Parents that can&#39;t be accepting and loving in the face of<br/>\ndisappointment and difference make us afraid of disappointing and of being<br/>\ndifferent. Etc, etc, etc. One could spend many hours analysing why one is<br/>\nafraid. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa picks up on the &#39;fear of hell&#39; aspect. How grateful I am that that<br/>\nis one fear that has never ruled me. I would chuck that fear where it<br/>\nbelongs.... easier said than done, I know... because I am a Christian, I<br/>\nwould spend a lot of time reading the Bible to see what it really says (as<br/>\nopposed to what people say the Bible says) about God and His loving kindness<br/>\nto find the courage I needed.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes courage to face ones fears and to explore anyway. As a horse rider,<br/>\ntrained traditionally in a Germanic riding style, and who used to &#39;do&#39;<br/>\nDressage, Parelli stripped me painfully naked. I didn&#39;t even have anywhere<br/>\nto hide - my 15 year old daughter &#39;horse whisperer natural&#39; was watching<br/>\nwith unsympathetic and critical eyes. What would I do? I spent months crying<br/>\nin a corner while my pony grazed peacefully in his paddock. Eventually I<br/>\nfaced the facts - I couldn&#39;t go back, because Pat Parelli&#39;s thinking  had<br/>\nchanged me - I had been to one of his conferences and seen what he did with<br/>\nhis horses, and there was no other way to go anymore. I had to go forward or<br/>\nget out of riding. Soooo... I am going forward. And you know what? I am<br/>\nfinding the freedom. Yesterday I went for a hack; cantered down a long<br/>\nstretch without my hands even on the reins, much less taking up a contact.<br/>\nIt was one of those &#39;wow&#39; moments that make the struggle to be born worth<br/>\nit. Know what I mean???<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling was the same. In 2001 we began what we called an &#39;unschooling<br/>\nexperiment&#39;. As time went by, I also knew that there was no going back. I<br/>\nhad read John Holt&#39;s books. And I saw that he was right.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nQuestioning of any sort is tough. It provokes growth. It forces<br/>\nconfrontation with who we are and with who we really hope to be. It makes us<br/>\nlet go of stuff that we thought we needed and have lugged along for so long<br/>\nthat the letting go leaves one feeling so vulnerable.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nQuestions about religious faith are particularly tough. Faith is supposed to<br/>\nbe the foundation after all. What will happen if I destabilize my<br/>\nfoundation? How will I survive such a shaking???<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI am a Christian. I find myself secure in the knowledge that God loves me.<br/>\nMy confidence is not in what I believe, but in Him. It is not my belief that<br/>\nholds me in my place; it is the powerful certainty that I am in His hands,<br/>\nthat He will not let me go, that He will finish the work He has begun in me.<br/>\nQuestioning strengthened my faith, and with it, my peace. For others,<br/>\nquestioning results in a letting go. Maybe because they had not found a<br/>\nfaith of their own; it was somebody else&#39;s faith that they were holding.<br/>\nUltimately, although others can help us along the way, and give us their<br/>\nfaith to lean on for a while, we have to establish our own<br/>\nfaith/belief/conviction about the meaning of life, Who and What God is, and<br/>\nhow to live in this world. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI have had to face the turmoil of questioning whether it was acceptable to<br/>\nbe both a Christian and an unschooler. It was a cliff edge. I cast myself on<br/>\nHis grace and leapt. I have discovered (am discovering) that truly, it was<br/>\nfor freedom that Christ set us free. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nJesus was not afraid of freedom. I see this when I look at the stories<br/>\nwritten about Him in the Gospels. Things He said and did. He dared to<br/>\nchallenge the conventions and thinking of the day. Sure, it got Him killed<br/>\nin the end. But what freedom and peace and joy He bought with that dying. I<br/>\nam one who still feasts on it. In my case, Christianity led me into<br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not wrong to ask questions. It is a false guilt that says that it is.<br/>\nYou find it everywhere - not just in religion. My brother in law says that<br/>\nhe hopes for our sakes that we will not live to regret the educational<br/>\nchoices we have made for our children. Guilt and shame accompany his point<br/>\nof view. It is up to me to accept it or to reject it. I don&#39;t have to be<br/>\nguilty.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOne very real concern is that Melissa&#39;s husband is reacting negatively. Will<br/>\nhe cope with her questioning? Will he have the courage to face the questions<br/>\nhimself, or will he continue to maintain his comfort zone? Is it important<br/>\nenough to her to take the risk of destabilising her marriage? How strong is<br/>\nthe marriage - will it cope??? It also sounds like there is unlikely to be a<br/>\nsupportive or sympathetic response from the extended family. Is it worth<br/>\nrocking the boat so hard? These are tough questions that only she can<br/>\nanswer. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, Melissa commented: &gt;&gt;&gt;Somehow, I don&#39;t think that Jesus would<br/>\napprove of what churches have become and how manipulative and conrolling<br/>\nthey are.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with this statement. As unschoolers, hubby, kids, and I all find<br/>\nourselves with ambivalent feelings about church. We like the singing and the<br/>\nworship, the Bible teaching in our church is great, we enjoy the feeling of<br/>\ngetting together with other Christians. But, we actively dislike the feeling<br/>\nof being organised, slotted into our place, ticked off on the list. We cause<br/>\nthe church leadership a few problems as we just don&#39;t fit in a neat little<br/>\nbox... We are individuals first, then part of a group. Church often feels<br/>\nlike the order of priority is the other way around. I suppose this is true<br/>\nof many groups.

Once we realize we can question everything we<br/>\nthought was &quot;right&quot; and &quot;good&quot;, it&#39;s a snowball effect. It&#39;s called<br/>\nthinking for yourself.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re in that no man&#39;s (or woman&#39;s in this case) land where you<br/>\naren&#39;t sure of certain things and it feels a bit like casting about<br/>\nwithout a foundation anymore. I remember.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I found out, is that as I grew in confidence and felt the need to<br/>\nquestion everything (even my firmly entrenched Christian beliefs) I<br/>\nbecame a person with peace. Real peace. Not the kind of peace the<br/>\nchurch offered which was actually constant torment about hell, but the<br/>\nkind of peace that is about being OK with not knowing! Cool place<br/>\nactually.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t consider myself a Christian any longer, nor do I live in any<br/>\nkind of fear (except maybe the fear that the world may run out of<br/>\ntruffles someday).:)<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I can say, is unschooling blossoms best when people question<br/>\nthings, even their own beliefs. Unschooling works best when we are<br/>\nwilling to turn things upside down and all around and examine it from<br/>\nmany angles. It works best when kids are free to question things and<br/>\nnot get a judgemental response but a curious adult to explore with<br/>\nthem...especially on topics like religion and spirituality.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started reading a lot of history that didn&#39;t mesh with what I&#39;d been<br/>\ntaught all those years before, and came to conclusions that seem a lot<br/>\nmore based on reality than belief. <br/>\n<br/>\nWherever you&#39;re at in your questioning, I think you&#39;ll really love a<br/>\nbook that I&#39;m reading right now. It&#39;s titled &quot;Dance of the Dissident<br/>\nDaughter&quot; by Sue Monk Kidd.

It was very <br/>\nfrustrating as I tried different methods, none of which ever seemed <br/>\nright.  There was always something missing.  Nothing ever &quot;felt&quot; <br/>\nright.  I tried a Christian program, then unit studies (Konos), then <br/>\nMontessori, and finally, Charlotte Mason.  While googling CM <br/>\napproaches, I came across unschooling and began investigating.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo here I am, 7 months later, and this approach &quot;feels&quot; so right.  <br/>\nAs I delve into the philosophy of unschooling and apply it to our <br/>\nlives, I have begun to question other areas of my life -- not just the <br/>\nschooling aspect.  I&#39;ve begun to question the role of mainstream <br/>\nChristianity in my life.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was raised with the typical belief that you have to be good or you <br/>\nwill go to Hell.  Couple that with an abusive, manipulative, <br/>\ncontrolling mother and you can bet I&#39;ve got lots of hang-ups.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this a typical thing to go through as an unschooling parent?  Did <br/>\nmost of you at some point begin questioning your belief system?  How <br/>\ndid you deal with the guilt (I have such a tremendous amount right now) <br/>\nand the fear of doing the wrong thing and landing yourself in Hell?<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried talking to my husband, but it frankly scares him to hear me <br/>\ntalk in such a way.  He thinks I should just quit thinking about it and <br/>\ngo on to church and leave things alone.  I wouldn&#39;t dare talk to my <br/>\nmother-in-law.
