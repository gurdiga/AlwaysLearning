In fact, it&#39;s very common for people who enjoy reading to have a larger print vocabulary than they can actually use when they speak - I&#39;m one of those ;) I know more words than I can say because when I come across a new word in print I figure out the meaning and don&#39;t worry about how it&#39;s pronounced. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your daughter runs into a word she doesn&#39;t know, it&#39;s okay to tell her what it is, if you know it. It will help her more than coaxing her to sound it out - she&#39;ll be more likely to remember it next time she sees it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Words like: Choc-o-late<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oooooh, that&#39;s one where the &quot;right&quot; way to break it down in print doesn&#39;t reflect the way it&#39;s pronounced in some places - so if someone wanted to use it in a poem or song, it could just as easily have two syllables as three: choc&#39;late. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour husband has half a good idea, though ;) It can be helpful for some people to look for smaller words inside large words to help remember how to spell them. The syllables aren&#39;t as important as looking for some kind of meaningful cue for memory. When people complain my name is hard to spell, for instance, I can point out it contains another name: Edith. But that won&#39;t help if you meet someone who spells it differently ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: How to Divide English Words Into Syllables?","postDate":"1349881762","msgId":69340,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgwOUNBNEU4LTlDQzQtNERDQi1COTg0LTI5RUJGMDlGM0FDQ0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGs0c3B1citydjVhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGs0c3B1citydjVhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69337,"nextInTopic":69343,"prevInTime":69339,"nextInTime":69341,"topicId":69308,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I got the workbook Language Smarts level D from the Critical Thinking company so my daughter looks knowledgeable in front on my in-laws and friends.
