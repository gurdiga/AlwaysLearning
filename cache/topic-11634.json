He&#39;s turning fourteen.  She wants to do it as a gag gift.  <br/>\n Castle Superstore is a VERY large porn shop, in the full size building of <br/>\nwhat used to be Standard Brands Paint, which sold paint, flooring and art <br/>\nsupplies for most of my life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was surprised 18 year olds could go in there, but she said they could.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I said I doubted the certificate would last until he was 18, and that he <br/>\nwould probably just be happy to put it on his wall, but he might want to send <br/>\nsomeone to actually get him something before it expires.  She said SHE <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t go get him something.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been in there.  There is a whole wall of dildos.  But the reason I went <br/>\nin was to get a t-shirt for a friend in England who asked me to look for it <br/>\nand it turned out that&#39;s the only store that had one.
