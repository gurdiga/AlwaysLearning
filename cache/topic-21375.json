Week<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis Week&#39;s Experiment - #405 Microwave Hot Spots<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings from Sarasota, Florida.  I will be here all week, doing more<br/>\nscience shows for Florida Power and Light.  Then I head home!  After <br/>\nmonths on the<br/>\nroad, it will be wonderful to be home, even if it is only for a couple <br/>\nof<br/>\ndays.  Then I am heading back to Memphis to celebrate the holidays with <br/>\nmy family. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter last week&#39;s experiment, I had quite a bit of chocolate laying <br/>\naround,<br/>\nso I looked for other experiments to try with it.  It will help show <br/>\nwhy most<br/>\nmicrowave ovens have a turntable to rotate the food.  You will need:<br/>\n<br/>\na large, flat chocolate bar<br/>\na paper plate<br/>\na rope<br/>\na microwave oven<br/>\n<br/>\nOpen the microwave oven and remove the turntable, if it has one.  We do <br/>\nnot<br/>\nwant the chocolate to move as we are heating it.  Place the chocolate <br/>\non the<br/>\npaper plate.  We are using paper because some regular plates get hot in <br/>\na<br/>\nmicrowave oven.  That would interfere with our experiment.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlace the plate with the chocolate into the oven.  Be sure that it will <br/>\nnot<br/>\nbe moved by the center spindle as it turns.  Set the timer for about 10 <br/>\nseconds<br/>\nand start the oven.  Watch carefully as the oven runs, to be sure that <br/>\nthe<br/>\nchocolate is not moving.  After 10 seconds, look at the chocolate, but <br/>\ndo not<br/>\nmove it.  Do you see any melted spots?  If not, then cook it for <br/>\nanother 5<br/>\nseconds and check again.  Continue cooking for 5 seconds at a time <br/>\nuntil you see<br/>\nmelted spots in the chocolate.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarefully examine the chocolate, being careful not to burn your finger <br/>\non the<br/>\nmelted candy.  Why did some parts remain cool, while others got hot <br/>\nenough to<br/>\nmelt?  It does not mean that there is anything wrong with your oven.  <br/>\nAll<br/>\nmicrowave ovens work that way.  To cook your food, the microwave oven <br/>\nproduces<br/>\nsomething called a standing wave.  Since it is easier to make one than <br/>\nto<br/>\ndescribe one, lets produce our own standing wave.<br/>\n<br/>\nTie one end of a rope to a doorknob or some other stationary object.  <br/>\nMove<br/>\nseveral feet away and take up the slack in the rope.  Jerk the rope <br/>\nquickly to<br/>\nthe side and watch as it produces a wave that moves along the rope.  <br/>\nNotice how<br/>\nthe wave moves from your hand towards the other end.  Next, shake the <br/>\nrope<br/>\nquickly from side to side.  Watch the pattern of the rope as you shake <br/>\nit faster<br/>\nand slower.  Watch for the point where the waves seem to stop moving <br/>\naway<br/>\nfrom you.  At that point, you will notice that you have several waves <br/>\nin the<br/>\nrope, separated by points on the rope that are hardly moving at all.  <br/>\nWhen you<br/>\nreach that pattern you have produced a standing wave.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour microwave oven produces standing waves of microwave energy.  At the<br/>\npoints where the wave is at its highest, you get the most heat.  At the <br/>\npoints<br/>\nwhere the wave is hardly moving, things stay cool.  Turning the food <br/>\nmoves these<br/>\npoints around, helping the food cook more evenly.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe aware that melted chocolate can get very hot.  Do not touch it with <br/>\nyour<br/>\nskin.  As a safety precaution, mix the melted chocolate with something <br/>\ncold,<br/>\nsuch as vanilla ice cream.  Add some chopped nuts and then dispose of it<br/>\nproperly.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a wonder filled week. <br/>\n<br/>\n****************************************<br/>\nThis weekly e-mail list is free from charge.   You are welcome to <br/>\nforward it<br/>\nto friends, print it in your newsletter,
