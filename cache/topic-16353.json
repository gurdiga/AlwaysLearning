They seem to be statistical comparisons of traits of <br/>\nstudies of large groups of people.  As though there were no other factors, what do <br/>\nfirst-borns have in common?  That&#39;s interesting as far as it goes, but within <br/>\nany one actual family, I think other factors are greater than just birth <br/>\norder.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith only three, we see some definite firstborn stuff with Kirby, some <br/>\nunquestionable mid-kid with Marty and Holly KNOWS she inherits the world (if all <br/>\ngoes well, she&#39;ll be the last remaining child with her pick of the bedrooms, <br/>\nprobably a decent car to drive, unlike Kirby&#39;s driver&#39;s license experience which <br/>\nis he can share my ten year old mini-van, etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus you get the gender factors.  A fourth child who&#39;s the same gender as the <br/>\nothers won&#39;t get the special perks of one who&#39;s the first boy or girl after <br/>\nthree of the other kind.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":140885507,"authorName":"gehrkes","from":"&quot;gehrkes&quot; &lt;gehrkes@...&gt;","profile":"gehrkes","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Birth Orders","postDate":"1063986873","msgId":16354,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJrZjhycCtzbWg3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDMwOTE5MTI0MzMyLjU1ODkwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjEzNzA3Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16353,"nextInTopic":16356,"prevInTime":16353,"nextInTime":16355,"topicId":16353,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Okay drawing from my rusty memory...
