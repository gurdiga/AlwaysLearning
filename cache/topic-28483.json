I&#39;m Wende, unschooling my two great kids Ben (5, almost 6) and<br/>\nAliza who is 4.  I read several of John Holt&#39;s books while I was<br/>\npregnant with Ben, and we decided this would be the way to go for us<br/>\nfrom the start.  I&#39;m by far the &quot;primary&quot; parent, but my husband John<br/>\n(who travels a lot) is a super &quot;outide the box&quot; guy who keeps things<br/>\nfresh and exciting.  We live in coastal SC.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve joined the group for some support and inspiration.  I belong to<br/>\nan active homeschooling community, but most of the members are &quot;school<br/>\nat home&quot; families.  I respect and am grateful for my local group but<br/>\nsometimes have questions, musings and quandaries very specific to our<br/>\nunschooling lifestyle.  I&#39;m pleased to have found myself here!<br/>\nWende<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nNot only is the conference in Asheville, NC this September (600-700 or <br/>\nmore unschoolers in one place!), but there&#39;s an unschooling group <br/>\nsomewhere near you.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have School&#39;s Out Support (statewide) and ChazUnschoolers---and the <br/>\nNCUnschoolers are very active if you&#39;re closer to the NC line.<br/>\n<br/>\nGoogling &quot;Unschooling/ers&quot; and &quot;your state&quot;  (for example: unschooling <br/>\nMT or unschoolers ID) should always get you a dozen or so hits.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso---if there is NOT a group near you, start one! Post on the local <br/>\ninclusive lists (and others) that you are on and say that you are <br/>\nlooking for other unschoolers. Make an e-group: <br/>\nCoastalUnschoolers@yahoo.... or something like that. They come out of <br/>\nthe woodwork---they really do! It&#39;s just that everyone is waiting for <br/>\nsomeone *else* to do the work. BE that someone else!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll email you off list about state-specific stuff and to hook you up <br/>\nwith SOS, but to meet unschoolers in your area, you need to be <br/>\nproactive!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAOL now offers free email to everyone.
