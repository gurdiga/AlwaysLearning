The more a story is about  <br/>\nlearning or parenting the better.<br/>\n<br/>\nStories about school and relationships with parents are not nearly as  <br/>\ngood.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like stories that are carefully factual and well thought out.    <br/>\nWhile it&#39; can be therapeutic to journal one&#39;s immediate feelings, it&#39;s  <br/>\nnot therapeutic for this group to read them.  If anyone has joined  <br/>\nsince I last mentioned this. the list has well over 1000 readers (plus  <br/>\nsome old leftover accounts, putting Yahoogroups official count at  <br/>\n2085.   There aren&#39;t that many reading every post.  There are hundreds  <br/>\nof people reading every post, though, so don&#39;t post emotional  <br/>\noutpourings.  Post things that will help readers understand  <br/>\nunschooling, or that will ask a question or present a situation that  <br/>\ncan be discussed here.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrim your posts.  Don&#39;t append two or three posts.  Don&#39;t even append  <br/>\none whole post.<br/>\n<br/>\nGratitude is wonderful, but it&#39;s okay to be grateful without posting  <br/>\n&quot;thanks!&quot; to the group.  It&#39;s much better to bask in the warmth of  <br/>\ngratitude while you play with your kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve averaged over 25 posts a day this year so far.   Let&#39;s let the  <br/>\naverage of great posts be high too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone comes here agitated and is sent links and the person  <br/>\ncontinues to respond without having read those links, it&#39;s a little  <br/>\nlike offering a relative to discuss something after they&#39;ve read about  <br/>\nunschooling, and then them say &quot;Yeah, but...&quot;   Read the links people  <br/>\nsend you about making choices and thinking about food.  And not school- <br/>\nstyle, where you open the book to that page and turn the page when you  <br/>\nsee other people turn the page.   The links at Joyce&#39;s site and mine  <br/>\nare the greatest hits of the past ten or twelve unschooling discussion  <br/>\nyears.  If you can&#39;t be bothered to read the really great stuff,  <br/>\nplease just read here and don&#39;t write for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nGoing gradually into unschooling and being mindful are being missed by  <br/>\nsome of those newer to unschooling.   Please, everyone, take a look at  <br/>\nthese two pages.   People who don&#39;t know why should look the  <br/>\nlongest.   Those who do know why might want to look to see what could  <br/>\nbe added in way of link or clarification.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44587,"nextTopicId":44614}}
