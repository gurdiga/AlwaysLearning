Sorscha is 10 1/2 and we negotiate situations on a daily <br/>\nbasis.  There are simply things and situations that Sorscha is not prepared <br/>\nor capable of being in at this time.  It&#39;s that simple.  I make sure that I <br/>\nam almost always present.  If I cannot be present, I make sure that someone <br/>\nI trust is.  By present I don&#39;t just mean that my adult body is there - I <br/>\nmean that I am the mama eagle who is constantly observing my kiddo.  I can <br/>\nbe 50-yards away and know by my kiddos face if something is up.  This allows <br/>\nme to &#39;catch&#39; things as they arise (before any blowout can occur -yes, they <br/>\nstill DO occur sometimes) and I can then help her to consider her options, <br/>\nmake choices, etc.   I don&#39;t leave Sorscha anywhere - even with other <br/>\nunschooling families - where I do not feel that the parent is capable of <br/>\nbeing observant enough for my kiddo.  She needs loving, kind, compassionate, <br/>\npatient, adults who can speak to her calmly and frankly.  I also don&#39;t leave <br/>\nSorscha anywhere where she cannot contact me for assistance.  We also make <br/>\nchoices not to attend certain activities, leave early, or come late.  We <br/>\nmake these decisions together.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the past couple of years, this has all gotten easier and I find that we <br/>\nare approaching a time when Sorscha will be capable of socializing on her <br/>\nown.  I&#39;m happy for her.  I&#39;m happy and grateful for all the years that I <br/>\nhave spent helping her to get to this point.  Years ago I was resentful that <br/>\nSorscha was not like &#39;those other kids&#39;.  I was always the Mom who some <br/>\nother parent would come to and complain about my kid to.  My feelings were <br/>\noften hurt and I&#39;d want to scream, &quot;CAN&#39;T YOU SEE THAT I&#39;M DOING EVERYTHING <br/>\nI CAN!!! I&#39;m not oblivious!&quot;  I got to a point where I chose not to let it <br/>\nfester in me and I put all that energy into helping Sorscha on her journey. <br/>\nNow I receive compliments - it&#39;s a weird place to be when someone says, <br/>\n&quot;Wow, Sorscha has come along way!&quot;  My return response is, &quot;It&#39;s all <br/>\nSorscha, not me. Just like she learned to read with my assistance, she&#39;s <br/>\nlearning how to negotiate her world with my assistance.&quot;<br/>\n~Crystal~<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://livingtheliquidlife.blogspot.com/\">http://livingtheliquidlife.blogspot.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19885,"nextTopicId":36354}}
