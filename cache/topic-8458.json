Thank you everyone for your advice<br/>\nand concern.  I talked with a person who has many many<br/>\nyears of experience being involved in legal lobbying<br/>\nand office holding, as an unschooling parent and<br/>\ngrandparent.  She told me what our best course of<br/>\naction is and I wanted to share it with you all, in<br/>\ncase anyone could use the information.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBy not enrolling in shcool in CA for the fall and<br/>\ninforming the school there that she has moved, she<br/>\nwill remove herself from the California system in the<br/>\nmost painless manner possible.  Then by moving up here<br/>\nand my filing of a Letter of Intent with the state for<br/>\nHomeschooling, she will be free of the system up here<br/>\nand can make her own choices about what she wants to<br/>\npersue.  She said, to be on the safe side, have a<br/>\nnotarized statement from her parents making me &quot;Legal<br/>\nGuardian for the purposes of Education&quot; but that<br/>\nfrankly, no one every checks those.  Simple,<br/>\nthankfully, and very painless. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo she is headed home to pack and take care of some<br/>\nthings there.  She really feels the need to have some<br/>\nclosure with her twin sisters, for whom she is the<br/>\nprimary caretaker.  She has made the VERY difficult<br/>\ndecision of leaving them behind to persue a life of<br/>\nher own, as she cannot truly change their situation or<br/>\nparents, and would only hurt herself by staying.  I am<br/>\ntotally sympathetic to how hard this is for her to do,<br/>\nhaving had a similar situation of losing her when she<br/>\nwas about the age here sisters are now.  She wants to<br/>\ndo what I did, and get herself set up to be able to<br/>\nhave a place for them to come to if/when they can and<br/>\nneed it, to visit or to live.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in a month or so I will be making arrangements for<br/>\nher to come back up here to stay, and she is so happy,<br/>\nbecause after all summer here, being treated<br/>\nrespectfully and as an equal, she was dreading going<br/>\nhome again.  It&#39;s easier to accept horrible realities<br/>\nif you don&#39;t really know what you are missing, and<br/>\nthis is the first year I have been able to wrest her<br/>\naway from the rest of the family for the entire<br/>\nsummer.  Well actually the first year she was ballsy<br/>\nenough to say &quot;I&#39;m not coming back, I&#39;m staying here<br/>\nwith Nanci all summer.&quot;  They grumbled and growled and<br/>\nnagged and guilted, but we stood firm, and supported<br/>\neach other. I can&#39;t tell you how excited I am to have<br/>\nher FINALLY coming to live with us, coming home, as it<br/>\nfeels to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8493,"nextTopicId":8384}}
