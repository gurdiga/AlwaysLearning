The most thrilling moment for me<br/>\nwas when the DJ was asking them about homeschooling.  He asked &quot;who teaches<br/>\nyou, your mom?&quot; and they said &quot;No we teach ourselves.&quot;  He was surprised and<br/>\nmade some really positive comments about how neat that must be.  We had such<br/>\na fun time - I got us rooms at the Heartbreak Hotel and took them to supper<br/>\nat the Rock n Roll Caf√©.  They got to meet George Klein, Elvis&#39;s high school<br/>\nfriend and former member of the Memphis Mafia, and the kids got to see an<br/>\nevening Elvis impersonator show, which was a blast.

As a child, I can&#39;t  <br/>\nrecall a situation of being totally into something and learning about  <br/>\nit in such a deep way.  I was more likely to read one of my favorite  <br/>\nbooks over again, or listen to my favorite album for the 900th time.   <br/>\nAs a young adult, I was more likely to dabble in things too, which  <br/>\nmight be just a style sort of thing.

We did not  <br/>\nlove tv from the beginning.  Although I absolutely adored film, and  <br/>\nspent much of my 20&#39;s in old Chicago movie-houses watching  <br/>\nindependent films, we definitely came from the &quot;it&#39;s a tool to be  <br/>\nmanaged&quot; mindset as parents, and could have easily gone down the path  <br/>\nof increasingly limiting shows/time, etc (funny, in hindsight, that I  <br/>\nmight have wanted to restrict something that my kids would naturally  <br/>\nbe drawn to).  I think it has been helpful for me to see the cases  <br/>\nwhere people have gone from one mindset to another, and I&#39;d be happy  <br/>\nto post more details on our experience if people are interested.   <br/>\nActually we&#39;ve done that in almost every area.  Not that we were  <br/>\nevilly restrictive parents, but we didn&#39;t necessarily question  <br/>\ntraditional parenting choices in the beginning.  I think that&#39;s so  <br/>\ncritical to say, because it&#39;s easy for me to shout &quot;I LOVE TV&quot; from  <br/>\nthe mountaintops now, but it might be helpful for others earlier (or  <br/>\neven later) on the path to know that not every really happy convinced  <br/>\nunschooler starts out that way, and it really is possible to go  <br/>\nthrough dramatic change in your thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sep 21, 2007, at 12:06 PM, Sandra Dodd wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Aw, JEEZ, no, Kelly,--you said &quot;methodology.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I loved your whole post.

Bought all the 45s (and sold them, with their<br/>\n&gt; paper covers, to a collector around 1980).  From and because of that<br/>\n&gt; I was interested in looking into things related to their childhoods<br/>\n&gt; and interests, and so I knew, because I knew John Lennon&#39;s birthday,<br/>\n&gt; that London was being bombed then.  Big tie-in to WWII.  I learned<br/>\n&gt; more about India, though I already knew some, and a few years later<br/>\n&gt; had an Indian boyfriend for four years.  I got to meet Ravi Shankar,<br/>\n&gt; through that, and thought &quot;Cool; he met the Beatles!&quot;  I think I<br/>\n&gt; could write for days straight about connections I made from my<br/>\n&gt; interest in The Beatles.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So...<br/>\n&gt; I didn&#39;t develop that.

For example, when we got our satellite radio, the kids<br/>\ndiscovered Elvis.  My mom and I are already crazy about Elvis, and now all<br/>\nfour of our kids are, especially the girls.  We have been in an intense<br/>\nElvis phase for probably the last year, all Elvis all the time in the car.<br/>\nWe listen to the Elvis Quiz Show on Fridays and the kids try to guess the<br/>\nsong snippets.  They&#39;ve decided they want to go be on the Elvis Quiz Show.<br/>\nWe&#39;ve used our TiVo to search and record Elvis movies and documentaries and<br/>\nthey&#39;ve learned all about his life.  We listen to George Klein interview<br/>\nvarious Elvis friends, and get to see glimpses into the lives of these other<br/>\npeople.  They have listened many times to the Million Dollar Quartet sing<br/>\nand sometimes point out one of the other singers when he hear one of their<br/>\nsongs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has given them an extra connection to their grandma, who lives in Little<br/>\nRock and has begun making treks to Graceland for trinkets for them and who<br/>\ngave them her much prized ticket stub from an Elvis concert.  When we go to<br/>\nLittle Rock for Thanksgiving, we will surely go to Graceland for a tour.<br/>\nIt&#39;s connected them with a family friend, who actually used to live behind<br/>\nGraceland when Elvis first moved there.  (And amazingly she didn&#39;t throw<br/>\nherself over the back fence to borrow sugar!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis summer, my daughter and son had a shared birthday party (their<br/>\nbirthdays are two days apart and they chose to share a party) and the party<br/>\nwas an Elvis party.  I wrote Argo from the Elvis radio channel to see if he<br/>\ncould email them a happy birthday, and he wrote back that he&#39;d rather call<br/>\nand wish them happy birthday!  Even better, their party happened to be on<br/>\nthe day when the Elvis channel was celebrating three years on air and was<br/>\nhaving a special quiz show.  Since we&#39;d planned to have our own Elvis quiz<br/>\nshow, we just put the radio&#39;s quiz show on for the party, and the DJs called<br/>\nout to our two birthday kids, saying &quot;Isabella and Jake love Elvis and are<br/>\nhaving an Elvis party right now while we&#39;re having one.&quot;  It was so<br/>\nexciting.  And all of our friends have enjoyed being on the periphery of the<br/>\nElvis craze.  Some have brought their Elvis movies out of their boxes and<br/>\nloaned them to the girls or watched them with the kids.  This Halloween all<br/>\nfour kids want to dress &quot;Elvis.&quot;  My older son wants to be Elvis as a<br/>\nsoldier.  My daughter wants to be Priscilla, and the other two want to be<br/>\nother versions of Elvis.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey also love spotting other Elvis influences on TV - in Lilo and Stitch,<br/>\non the Dollywood commercial.  One kid saw a commercial for wheeled sneakers<br/>\nand commented that his song &quot;Wheels on my Heels&quot; would have been a good song<br/>\nfor the commercial.  We&#39;ve enjoyed browsing YouTube and listening to Lisa<br/>\nMarie sing a duet &quot;Don&#39;t Cry Daddy&quot; with Elvis (obviously digitally blended<br/>\ninto his song).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been so many fun blendings of all of these different sources and<br/>\nKelly is right, it is definitley an expansive and wonderful experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nShannon<br/>\n<br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Free Edition. <br/>\nVersion: 7.5.487 / Virus Database: 269.13.22/1015 - Release Date: 9/18/2007<br/>\n11:53 AM</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117369878,"authorName":"Kelli Traaseth","from":"Kelli Traaseth &lt;kellitraas@...&gt;","profile":"kellitraas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Learning Expansiveness/Connectiveness","postDate":"1190402933","msgId":30775,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM2Nzc1OC42OTU5My5xbUB3ZWI1MTEwNy5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGZhNzJmZjFmMGU1YjFiNTEwZGIwZTZiZmYxYzg1YjI3QGNveC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":30774,"nextInTopic":30776,"prevInTime":30774,"nextInTime":30776,"topicId":30763,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***I was thinking, too, about how my family watches TV and movies.

We connect, connect, connect.  I think it&#39;s what human&#39;s brains do, if allowed ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust earlier this morning Abbi (soon to be 13) was working on the laptop and she had her new playlist going from her blog.  Bruce Springsteen&#39;s Dancing in the Dark came up and Courtney Cox&#39;s image came to my mind. &lt;g&gt;  After the song was done, we got Youtube up and found his live performance with her debut dance in it.  Pretty fun.  That&#39;s just a beginning or maybe a middle of connections, Abbi knew Cox from Adam Sandler&#39;s Longest Yard and we had connections from that movie to the old Longest Yard to Burt Reynolds (who was in both).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust recently we were on a connections ride which actually led to a touch on to the Riot Act that Sandra mentioned and continued to the French Impressionists and French History.  It all came from us liking (OK, obsessing over ;)  Richard Armitage,  the Britsh actor.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt all started when I thought I&#39;d try a new series I heard of from Netflix.  It&#39;s BBC&#39;s Robin Hood 2006.  We&#39;ve liked other Robin Hood&#39;s and heard this one was fun.  Well, we loved it and ended up buying the first season.  Abbi really liked Richard Armitage in it and wondered if there was anything else with him in.  She and I both looked on Netflix, IMDB  and found BBC&#39;s North and South.  We were happy to see that we could watch it immediately from Netflix.  If you didn&#39;t know, Netflix now has an option to watch some shows right on your computer, immediate downloads, and it&#39;s in addition to your monthly ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo.. we got &#39;North and South&#39; which told the story of a woman going from a countryside life to a town life and it touches on the industrial changes in 19th century England.  Well, we still weren&#39;t done with wanting more of Mr. Armitage, so we also put &#39;The Impressionists&#39; on the queue and watched it when it arrived.  That was also a great show.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we started with Robin Hood, continued to 19th century England and ended.. for now (although it&#39;s never really ended because the connections will continue) with the impressionists artists.<br/>\n<br/>\nVery cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote a little bit about it here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ourjoyfullife.blogspot.com/2007/08/obsessive-learning.html\">http://ourjoyfullife.blogspot.com/2007/08/obsessive-learning.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kelli~<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ourjoyfullife.blogspot.com/\">http://ourjoyfullife.blogspot.com/</a>  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one&#39;s courage.&quot;  ~Anais Nin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nLooking for a deal?
