The woman I was working for for a while had an English<br/>\n&gt;degree, a law degree and an MBA.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Her house is nicer, and she owns two newish cars all by herself.<br/>\n&gt;My house is bigger, but not &quot;nice,&quot; and I drive a ten year old paint-<br/>\n&gt;peeling used Dodge Caravan.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My house is very happy,  I have Keith and the kids.<br/>\n&gt;Her house is very quiet, usually.

First, I bet they&#39;re unattainable.  But<br/>\n&gt;what we are shown as examples seem all from the &quot;success&quot; end of<br/>\n&gt;things�people point at HAPPY (married with children, financially<br/>\n&gt;stable) &quot;professionals&quot; whose degrees enabled them to work in<br/>\n&gt;whatever field it is.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But one could point at lottery winners and casino jackpot winners and<br/>\n&gt;say &quot;See?  If these people hadn&#39;t gambled, they wouldn&#39;t be<br/>\n&gt;millionaires.&quot;  And if  no one said &quot;But what about all the LOSERS?,&quot;<br/>\n&gt;it might seem to make sense, for a moment.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Someone with a better head for numbers might describe this better,<br/>\n&gt;but what I was clumsily picturing in my mind as the chart of<br/>\n&gt;statistics I WISH we had would involve:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What percentage of degreed potential professionals (PhD or  Master&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;or Law or Medicine, dentists, veterinarians�whatever it might be) are<br/>\n&gt;NOT working in that field?<br/>\n&gt;Of those who are working, how many wish they weren&#39;t?  (Some number,<br/>\n&gt;like the person I was going to talk to today, seem to wish they were<br/>\n&gt;in another field, but it&#39;s hard to quit once there are debts, and<br/>\n&gt;she&#39;s still making student loan payments after many years, too.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Of those who entered graduate school, how many wandered off without<br/>\n&gt;finishing?  How many of those still have student loans?<br/>\n&gt;Of those who begin college as freshmen or dabblers, how many do NOT<br/>\n&gt;get an undergrad degree?  (I know some didn&#39;t intend to, but were<br/>\n&gt;just taking music classes or golf or a theatre class, or just<br/>\n&gt;checking it out or using it as a springboard to get the heck away<br/>\n&gt;from home.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But if that could all be amassed in some visual form that I could<br/>\n&gt;understand (i.e. not lists of figures), which I don&#39;t think it ever<br/>\n&gt;really could, would it start to look like gambling stats, with LOTS<br/>\n&gt;and lots of losers, a few low-level winners, and very few REAL<br/>\n&gt;&quot;winners&quot;?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If fifty percent of the people who went to college with the intent to<br/>\n&gt;get a higher degree finished, THEN would college be a great promise<br/>\n&gt;of success?

I don&#39;t call it an unschooling conference on those lists.  I focus<br/>\n&gt;on AWSNA&#39;s sponsorship when mentioning it to Waldorf folks and The<br/>\n&gt;Montessori Foundation and Int&#39;l Mont. Council&#39;s when mentioning it to<br/>\n&gt;Montessori folks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;*&quot;Calling it an alternative education conference would&#39;ve been fine.<br/>\n&gt;*<br/>\n&gt;I hear you.  I think after hearing your concerns, I would refer to it in<br/>\n&gt;different terms on this list next time (although I won&#39;t be sending out<br/>\n&gt;another thing about it until about this time next year for the 4th annual<br/>\n&gt;conf!<br/>\n&gt;***<br/>\n&gt;&quot;I&#39;ve been to unschooling conferences. &lt;g&gt;  They&#39;re not about creating<br/>\n&gt;schools.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;* Creating schools and learning centers/communities is only an element of<br/>\n&gt;our conference, not the focus.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;*&quot;I know unschooling&#39;s a broad concept, and that there IS an unschooling<br/>\n&gt;thread through the conference topics, but my objection was that it seemed <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;be being billed as &quot;an unschooling conference&quot; for the purpose of this<br/>\n&gt;unschooling list.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;*<br/>\n&gt;You&#39;re right.  I did put the subject as &quot;June Unschooling Conference&quot; for<br/>\n&gt;the purpose of hoping to raise an extra eyebrow.  And I put it out in a<br/>\n&gt;different way to each list I post it too.  However, I wouldn&#39;t claim it to<br/>\n&gt;be a Montessori conference or Waldorf conference.  Unschooling,<br/>\n&gt;Homeschooling, and Democratic Education were the only ones that I felt<br/>\n&gt;applied out of all the alternatives.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;*&quot;It was a minor objection, honestly.  A clarification.  I have nothing<br/>\n&gt;whatsoever against school reform and alternative education. It&#39;s not just<br/>\n&gt;the same, though, as the unschooling families do at home with their own<br/>\n&gt;kids.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;*<br/>\n&gt;Certainly after hearing your concerns, I am more than happy to refer to it<br/>\n&gt;in a different way as my goal was not to be misleading.  However your<br/>\n&gt;comment about unschooling not being the same struck a cord with me.  While<br/>\n&gt;unschooling is certainly not the same as school reform, it is a very real<br/>\n&gt;and valued form alternative education.  Alternative education encompasses<br/>\n&gt;alternatives (see the cover of our packet for a visual example of this:<br/>\n&gt;www.edrev.org/packet.html ).  I also think it&#39;s worth making connections as<br/>\n&gt;unschoolers to the freedom-based democratic schools.  The similarities in<br/>\n&gt;not only philosophy, but daily approach to education is indecipherable most<br/>\n&gt;of the time.  That&#39;s not to say there aren&#39;t differences, as that line of<br/>\n&gt;thinking would be naive, but countless commonalities are worth paying<br/>\n&gt;attention to and learning from each other.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Best,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Isaac<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message 20<br/>\n&gt;     From: &quot;Pamela Sorooshian&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a><br/>\n&gt;     Date: Thu May 25, 2006 1:18am(PDT)<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: The dumb college argument<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On May 24, 2006, at 2:20 PM, Sandra Dodd wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If fifty percent of the people who went to college with the intent to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get a higher degree finished, THEN would college be a great promise<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of success?

Just to mention, I am not pushing home education on <br/>\nmy daughter, only seeking an alternative view point to the attitudes <br/>\nthat her dad and stepmom, both public school teachers, have been <br/>\nputting in her head that you can&#39;t succeed in life without a public <br/>\nor private school education.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also not lifting her hopes with unrealistic expectations.  We&#39;re <br/>\nfollowing the law to make a change which is our legal right, so we <br/>\nhave hope.  I won&#39;t squash that.  Her dad has been manipulative, <br/>\nflat out lying to her about what the laws in Georgia are because his <br/>\nidea is that no kids should ever have a choice on where to live or <br/>\nwhere to school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe (my daughter and I) have an appointment with my local school <br/>\ndistrict next week to register her for high school.  I&#39;m not <br/>\nadvocating that she move in with me and quit school all at the same <br/>\ntime.  I think that&#39;s going to be way too much on her.  However, I <br/>\ncan put a positive light on home education.  She can still take <br/>\nlessons and volunteer at a stable nearby even if she is in high <br/>\nschool.  Plus, the local high school has an Equestrian Team which <br/>\nshe thinks is very cool.

People should live within their  <br/>\nmeans. Whether is $x or $xxxx that they are making. Oddly enough,  <br/>\neveryone I know lives right up to the edge of their means (or just  <br/>\nbeyond ;-)  ), including my friend who is a doctor and her husband  <br/>\nthe software designer. They have more moola than I can conceive, yet  <br/>\nthey have no more cash than we do.<br/>\n<br/>\nEverything in life is negotiable. People think I&#39;m kidding, but I&#39;m  <br/>\nnot. Going out on a limb (although I&#39;ve been backed by writers and  <br/>\ngrownups who do social studies for a living), our society has  <br/>\nsquashed the innovative gene. People in India, China, Africa live in  <br/>\nabject poverty (ok, not all of them, that was a sweeping  <br/>\ngeneralization, huh?) but they have houses (such as they are)....they  <br/>\ncreate jobs for themselves selling flowers, or food, or embroidery,  <br/>\nwhatever their talent may lie in. Kids here are taught to live the  <br/>\nstatus quo &#39;go to school, go to college, get a job somewhere  <br/>\nestablished, get married, have 2.2 kids, buy two cars, get the  <br/>\nbiggest house you can afford, carry on til you die, maybe vacation  <br/>\nsomewhere beachy and hot every two years&#39;. Why is that the status  <br/>\nquo? Why do we mock those who choose to break it?<br/>\n<br/>\nExample: My friend Natalie. Her husband and she agreed that they  <br/>\nwould pay for college as they can afford it, ie, they do not get  <br/>\nstudent loans. Hard enough as it is, but they also have six kids. He  <br/>\nworks a full time job. She homeschools the kids. From what we&#39;ve  <br/>\ntaught, this would be impossible. But they manage it in a symphony of  <br/>\ngrace and beauty that brings tears to my eyes. They have CHOSEN to  <br/>\nlive in university apartments in what some may consider poverty  <br/>\nconditions. It&#39;s a little apartment. They have one van for the lot of  <br/>\nthem. They CHOOSE to not have car loans. They CHOOSE not to have  <br/>\ninsurance, and pay everything in cash as illnesses pop up (and they  <br/>\nhave had more than their fair share). They have CHOSEN to spend $x a  <br/>\nmonth to purchase land in Colorado. They CHOOSE not to buy as many  <br/>\nclothes, but do CHOOSE to buy sturdy brands that may cost a little  <br/>\nmore. They go on vacations, although they CHOOSE vacations that are  <br/>\nless expensive and more family related. They CHOOSE not to buy all  <br/>\nthe little things that our society says we should have, fancy  <br/>\nclothes, new cars, fast food,<br/>\n<br/>\nLife isn&#39;t that expensive, what is expensive is living up to  <br/>\nsociety&#39;s expectations.<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (8), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (4), Dan  <br/>\n(2), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On May 24, 2006, at 8:36 AM, freepsgal wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And of course there&#39;s my ds9 and dd8 to consider.

It seems <br/>\nthere is a general knowledge that those people who go to college and <br/>\nget a degree will make more money and be happier in their lives.  I <br/>\nneed a new perspective on this.  Here&#39;s an example.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dd just turned 14 and in our state of GA, she now has the right <br/>\nto choose which parent to live with.  I&#39;ve hired an attorney because <br/>\nmy dd wants to live with me.  Her dad is absolutely livid.  He <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like the way we parent and he has plans for Claire and is <br/>\nafraid I&#39;m going to ruin her life.  He&#39;s picked the high school for <br/>\nher, and then chose all her classes, electives and even after-school <br/>\nactivities.  My poor daughter is absolutely miserable there and <br/>\nwants to freedom to fly!  She&#39;s very brainwashed into thinking that <br/>\npublic school is the only way into college, and that college is the <br/>\nonly way into happiness.  If you ask her what she wants more than <br/>\nanything else though, it&#39;s to work with horses.  So she&#39;s planned to <br/>\ngo to college to be a Vet.  Now, in my unschooling lifestyle, I say <br/>\nshe should not go to school, but instead find her a stable nearby <br/>\nthat offers lessons and volunteer/job opportunities.  She&#39;d be in <br/>\nheaven!  But it all boils down to what about her future?  As a Vet, <br/>\nshe can make $$$$ dollars.  As a stable worker, she might only make <br/>\n$ dollars.  Either way she&#39;d be happy *later*, but what about <br/>\n*now*?  Her dad has told her that my ideas will ruin her life.  So <br/>\nshe wants to live with me but attend our local high school.  I told <br/>\nher I was totally supportive of anything SHE wants to do, not her <br/>\ndad&#39;s wishes, but hers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of course there&#39;s my ds9 and dd8 to consider.  I have no problem <br/>\nif they choose to not go to college, but how do I handle questions <br/>\nfrom well-meaning friends and relatives when they ask things <br/>\nlike, &#39;How will they afford a car and insurance, a house and <br/>\ninsurance, all the expenses of life, a family?&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW, I didn&#39;t finish college but I did marry someone who has 2 <br/>\ndegrees.  He makes a really nice salary so my family thinks I&#39;m okay <br/>\nbecause even though I can&#39;t take care of myself, I married someone <br/>\nwho can.
