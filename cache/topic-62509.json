Wal-Mart went in around that time too.  K-mart went in in the next town over.  But we had 2 or 3 fast food burger drive-ins even without McDonalds.  We had a Dairy Queen that was open during the warm months - they served ice-cream treats.  There were several diners - the food was probably just as greasy and high calorie.  At some point a Kentucky Fried Chicken and a couple of pizza places also went in.  In other words there were lots of options to eat out for the community, none of which would be considered healthy by today&#39;s standards.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one was condescending towards the burger eating people - it was just a nice treat to eat out.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course a lot of people today would blanch at the way we used to cook too.  When I moved to Colorado in 1983 I had a very hard time with the food being so different.    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":227835915,"authorName":"m_aduhene","from":"&quot;m_aduhene&quot; &lt;m_aduhene@...&gt;","profile":"m_aduhene","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: an interesting take on &quot;junk food&quot;","postDate":"1314467565","msgId":62541,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGozYmF0ZCtibDRjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDlCRERDNkYyLUI2QzEtNEYyNS1COENELTQ3MzA4OEY4NjBERkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":62510,"nextInTopic":62542,"prevInTime":62540,"nextInTime":62542,"topicId":62509,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"just envisioning the mummies pushing the ships through the fences.......sorry sandra :-)","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-219980399\">just envisioning the mummies pushing the &quot;ships&quot; through the fences.......sorry sandra :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; REALLY interesting:  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; An article in the Guardian about how the term junk food is more about class than <br/>\n&gt; about food: <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/brendanoneill2/100102199/this-jihad-against-junk-food-is-driven-by-naked-snobbery-for-the-lifestyles-of-the-lower-orders/\">http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/brendanoneill2/100102199/this-jihad-against-junk-food-is-driven-by-naked-snobbery-for-the-lifestyles-of-the-lower-orders/</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ======<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I want to point out that the moms pushing ships through the fence weren&#39;t giving them potato chips (American style / Brit=&quot;crisps&quot;), but a large portion of nice fried/steamed potatoes.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The term &quot;junk food&quot; should NOT include hamburgers, either.
