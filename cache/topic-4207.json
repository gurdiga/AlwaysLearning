We are very busy lately paying off bills so we can get to our<br/>\nhomestead and living the way we want to rather than the way my Mom wants us<br/>\nto. This has been helpful to me (this forced poverty) because I am really<br/>\nstarting to learn the value of a dollar. NObody ever said to me when I was<br/>\ngrowing up. We can&#39;t afford X because we need to keep money aside for Y. I<br/>\nthought money was never ending. I don&#39;t remember thinking that My Dad works<br/>\nto make money to buy food. Even after my parent&#39;s divorce and mom working,<br/>\nit was still very abstract to me. Never taught to balance a checkbook, make<br/>\na budget, or the value of my time. As an adult, this was (and still is) a<br/>\nsevere handicap. I have been struggling to get over this and realized that I<br/>\nneed to be much more open with the kids about our money. If we can&#39;t afford<br/>\nsomething, I let them know. I don&#39;t have the money for that now but maybe we<br/>\ncan wait until next week or look at yard sales or ask Grandpa for it for a<br/>\nbirthday present (big ticket items). When it is something that I am<br/>\nphilosophically opposed to (i.e. toy baby bottles for her doll is one of<br/>\nmine) I remind them that they get an allowance and they just have enough<br/>\nmoney left to buy it themselves. We are moving our new way of relating to<br/>\nevery member of our family into the money area now. I don&#39;t want Emily to<br/>\nlearn &quot;on the job&quot; the way I did - thru bounced checks, late payments,<br/>\nruined credit.<br/>\nElissa, who will soon be singing<br/>\nYippee - Kai - Yay!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4148,"nextTopicId":4187}}
