They can play  <br/>\nwith him without getting into reciting what they have that he doesn&#39;t,  <br/>\nmaybe, especially if he&#39;s likely to cover over with bravado or  <br/>\nbluff.    Maybe the kindest thing your own children could do would be  <br/>\nto say nice things to and about the boy. Maybe he doesn&#39;t get enough  <br/>\nof that.  Maybe he needs to hear that some of the things he knows and  <br/>\ncan do are cool and impressive.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Marty was seven or eight he went through a season of saying  <br/>\nthings that weren&#39;t true.  I said various things but one was &quot;Do you  <br/>\nwish that would happen, you mean?&quot; and gave him a chance to rephrase.   <br/>\nSometimes once he started the story he didn&#39;t know how to get back out  <br/>\nof it.

If he says &quot;I used to have a  <br/>\ndog like that,&quot; your kid could say &quot;Those dogs are pretty,&quot; not &quot;What  <br/>\nwas his name, then?&quot; or &quot;what happened to him?&quot; or &quot;I bet you  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t.&quot;   Neither entrapment nor argument will help the boy.  Maybe  <br/>\njust diverting the stories into other topics, kind of changing the  <br/>\nsubject or saying something that is simple and doesn&#39;t say &quot;HOW COOL!&quot;  <br/>\nor &quot;REALLY?&quot; would be better than either buying into the lie or  <br/>\ncalling it a lie.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaving face for the guest might be the boys&#39; goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it were me, I would talk to the other-family kid one-on-one  <br/>\nsomehow, casually if possible, and say it&#39;s important to only say what  <br/>\nREALLY happened.  It can be something that short.

I have also had a lot of discussions with my 13 yro daughter about picking your battles, because she cannot stand lying. The only time I say something is if they take their lie a little too far, like talking about riding a wild bison. I usually keep this between the other children and us because their parents punish them and I feel bad when this happens. So far the only time I have told a parent was when another child stole from my daughter and she caught her.

I would really like to hear from other parents about this. Not your own kids--but your kids friends. My kids have some","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1388846035\">How do you deal with kids who lie? I would really like to hear from other parents about this. Not your own kids--but your kids&#39; friends. My kids have some friends who lie so consistently that the boys no longer believe what their friends say, and I have gotten skittish about saying things to the parents like, &quot;So, little Octavian says you&#39;re going to Las Vegas next week!&quot; because such things have so often turned out not to be true. I&#39;m struggling with how to respond to the children, and also with how to talk to my kids about this.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the lies seem to be face-saving lies. Eric beats a kid at a video game, so the kid tells Eric about how much better than Eric his brother is at that game. Or my kids mention an upcoming trip, and the friend tells a big story about the much bigger and better vacation he and his family are taking soon. Or a kid seems to want to cover up areas of ignorance, so confronted with, say, a video game he hasn&#39;t played before, he&#39;ll nonetheless make up a bunch of stuff about what happens in the higher levels (this is not exactly lying...it&#39;s something else, similar and part of a pattern of behavior but not quite the same). Caught out, he&#39;ll claim to have gotten the information from &quot;a friend.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that lying is a common childhood thing, but in these cases it&#39;s a very consistent behavior that happens every time the kids are together. (About one of their friends, the quip about Clinton fits: &quot;Every word out of his mouth is a lie, including &#39;and&#39; and &#39;the.&#39;&quot;) The boys have caught on to it to the point that they will say to me or David, &quot;Octavian says he used to have a lot of really cool Legos, too, but he gave them away, but I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s true.&quot; What do I tell the boys? Do I talk to them about the factors (like, in one case, economic disparity between homes) that might lead a child to lie like this? Do I counsel them to ignore lies because of the motives I think lie behind them, or to confront them?<br/>\n<br/>\nin one case, the parents have been very helpful in talking about it, but it seems like some of the strategies that work for them (like asking mildly, &quot;Is that something you know, or something you just think might be true, or something from your imagination?&quot;) don&#39;t work as well for me--I think this kid doesn&#39;t feel as safe with me, so he won&#39;t admit to having made something up if I ask that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn another case, when I mentioned &quot;Hey, your kid says this thing!&quot; and it turned out not to be true, the parent was angry and indicated she would punish her child for the lie, and I don&#39;t want to get kids in trouble, God knows, for what I think are most likely adaptive but not all that functional responses to situations that are challenging for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn neither case is restricting visits a very good option right now. One of the kids is the son of my best friends, and he was only able to be taken out of school this year (which he desperately needed) because I agreed to keep him two days a week (we&#39;re down to one day a week now that his mom&#39;s job has ended for the summer), and there are a variety of reasons why, for the most part, I want the other one--a neighbor kid--to feel welcome at our home. The boys are not wanting less contact with their friends, at least not that they&#39;ve told me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a lot of sympathy for these kids but I am also frustrated and sometimes irritated, and just a few minutes ago there was a big fight when my kids challenged a friend and he got defensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m looking for any ideas people have; I just want to get outside my own head with this and get some new ideas to mull over.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nSu, mom to Eric, 9; Carl, 6; Yehva, 2.5<br/>\ntapeflags.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54828,"nextTopicId":54854}}
