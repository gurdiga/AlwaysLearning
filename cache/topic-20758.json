I went through and filled out the table and it came out to<br/>\njust about what our monthly electric bill totals.  The things that surprised<br/>\nme were how cheap it is to wash and dry clothes  (I won&#39;t need to feel<br/>\nguilty when I don&#39;t hang them out anymore.) and how expensive it is to run<br/>\nceiling fans and window fans.  I guess I&#39;ll shut them off more often when<br/>\nthey aren&#39;t in use.  I don&#39;t know why, but I figured ceiling fans didn&#39;t use<br/>\nmuch electricity.

Margaux heard most of our discussion.Late Saturday night, she came to me asking how much her gameboy recharger costs per month when it&#39;s not being used.  I know that there is some flow of energy happening in everything even when it&#39;s not turned on.  I didn&#39;t find the information on that yet, but we found this.  There&#39;s a great list of home appliances and how much they cost to operate.  You just fill in the amount of days they are in use, or the hours, and it shows you how much you&#39;re paying.
