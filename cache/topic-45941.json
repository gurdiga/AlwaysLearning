We try to honor where she is at while still being upbeat about how this will be for her in the long run.  She is enjoying all the free time though.  She still hasn&#39;t figured out what she is to do with herself.  Initially, she felt that she wouldn&#39;t learn anything.  So we have just been reassuring her that whatever she needs - we&#39;ll will help her get there.  All in due time - and I can see how the stress and anxiety of public school is melting away.<br/>\nMy middle child loves it.  She has never really enjoyed school and has often been pidgeonholed to being a bit of a &#39;slow-learner&#39;.  That&#39;s crap.  She is brilliant when left to her own devices - she isn&#39;t all that interested in confined book-reading and structured creativity.  I&#39;ve noticed marked improvement in her interpersonal skills, and am rather happy about that.  Actually the whole family is.<br/>\nNot much has changed for my youngest.  We are still doing what we have always done with him.  Living life.  Eating, pooping, playing, sleeping.  My perspective has changed though and I am seeing him and what &#39;he does&#39; in a different light.<br/>\nOver the last couple of months it&#39;s been a bit woobly-goobly-timey-whimey in our house.  The kids having various emotional reactions to the transition.  Me feeling unsure of our decision.  Messy at times and rather clear-minded at others.  We are definately in the midst of deschooling and trying to be extra gentle with ourselves and each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad to have found you all,<br/>\nMichelle in Ohio</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45967,"nextTopicId":45976}}
