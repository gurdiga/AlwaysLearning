It&#39;s a series of frustrated put-downs that continue to make my shoulders slump in disappointment at myself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy clumsiness was worse when my body was growing.  There was a year where I grew several inches.  My arm lengths were no longer predictable.  Many nights at the dinner table I would reach for my glass of milk, only to miss my target and knock it over.  The reaction was always the same - intense and frustrated.  A flurry of cleaning ensued.  A barrage of the same statements and rhetorical questions were loudly shared.  I felt at a total loss as to what the heck was &quot;wrong&quot; with me, and wondered why I was built so awkwardly.  Eventually, I started eating by myself at a tv table downstairs.

My husband is like that and he takes as much care as possible.<br/>\nJust yesterday he hit a tree with his new gator. Luckily it did not break anything because this time they got one with super protection thingies that really protect it! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHis Iphone I bought an Otter Box cover that has a hard case and a rubber case around it plus a screen protection. So far so good. He has gotten better with cel phones. We used to replace one every few months. <br/>\n<br/>\nCan you find some things that help him like that. THe other thing I always did,still do is take care of the stuff for them and help them with reminders. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son&#39;s keyboards get trashed every six months. It just happens. Since I have stepped over my laptop twice and broken the screen twice , and I am careful, I understand that stuff happens so even my Iphone has an Otter box cover just in case.<br/>\n<br/>\nElectronics  break easy. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also get replacement plans when I buy electronics. All of our gaming systems and computers have those replacements protection plans. It has been great and I have used them!! They have paid off for me. <br/>\nIs there something like that you can purchase for their electronics?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":403767111,"authorName":"Jo Isaac","from":"Jo Isaac &lt;joanneisaac@...&gt;","profile":"joanne.isaac","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Looking after belongings","postDate":"1347362858","msgId":68983,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERVQjEwMS1XNDY0RUI1NTA2RkY4NUU2OEQ3MkMyOEI3OTMwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PEYwNjFEODU5LTg5OEEtNEYzMS04RDNELTE3RUZBRjYxRDVCM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGsybXFpbituY3NwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8QTEwRTdDODAtQ0NGMC00MTEyLTkxMkItMEVBRDc4MEFCQTFBQHZlcml6b24ubmV0Piw8RjA2MUQ4NTktODk4QS00RjMxLThEM0QtMTdFRkFGNjFENUIzQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68982,"nextInTopic":68984,"prevInTime":68982,"nextInTime":68984,"topicId":68980,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"==I ve heard that there will be unbreakable screens (or less breakable screens) on some tablet computers soon (maybe there already are)== Panasonic make a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-217804967\">==I&#39;ve heard that there will be unbreakable screens (or less breakable screens) on some tablet computers soon (maybe there already are)==<br/>\n <br/>\nPanasonic make a &#39;toughbook&#39; notebook/laptop (apparently shockproof, waterproof, drop-proof, etc) - but they are very expensive.

It&#39;s how his brain is wired. He isn&#39;t *yet* able to be aware of what he&#39;s doing. He&#39;s so focused on the game or something else that&#39;s going on that he&#39;s oblivious to his environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s possible he&#39;ll always be somewhat oblivious but he will get better as he gets older and his brain develops more. You can&#39;t rush this any more than you can rush walking. You can, though, in the meantime, make him feel a failure at being the child you wish he was.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of trying to fix him, fix the environment. Be more present. *You* be the keeper of the things you don&#39;t want broken. Let him know you now realize that he can&#39;t *yet* be aware enough not to be rough with it. And you&#39;d like to help it last.<br/>\n<br/>\nBuy sturdier toys. Get more big muscle movement in during the day. Shop at Goodwill and yard sales. When you&#39;re shopping ask him if he thinks something is sturdy enough to last a good long while. Point out any weaknesses you notice. Ask his opinion about them. And if the toy doesn&#39;t last, be his partner in that decisions making process. You can say &quot;I guess it wasn&#39;t sturdy enough. We&#39;ll have to do more checking and testing next time.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":318664426,"authorName":"jofielding","from":"&quot;jofielding&quot; &lt;joannefielding@...&gt;","profile":"jofielding","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Looking after belongings","postDate":"1347349911","msgId":68980,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGsybXFpbituY3NwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":68981,"prevInTime":68979,"nextInTime":68981,"topicId":68980,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m struggling to help my 7 year old look after our things, and especially finding it hard to handle it when he breaks things.

New toys often get broken within a week.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn particular I&#39;m feeling upset about electronic breakages.  We got my 7 year old and 4 year old an Innotab for christmas.  It broke after 6 months.  We talked with our son about treating our belongings carefully (again).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe replaced it with a Google Nexus as we got a good deal on the preorder.  They both loved it, played lots of games, watched Netflix, youtube etc.  Then the screen got smashed when he was watching it in bed.  They&#39;d had it for a couple of weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel so frustrated about it.  We are not well off and don&#39;t have the money for another replacement.  Fixing the screen will cost almost as much as buying a new one.  Our insurance covers it but there&#39;s a £100 excess.  I&#39;m sad for my 4 year old, that another thing that was hers too has been broken.  I&#39;m sad for my 7 year old, and really cross at the same time.  I have an unproductive stream of consciousness about it (he&#39;s ungrateful, he doesn&#39;t deserve anything nice if he breaks things so frequently) and I need some help to change this.  It&#39;s really affecting how I&#39;m being with him at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nJo</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68992,"nextTopicId":69054}}
