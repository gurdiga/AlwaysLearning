I feel like, for unscholing to work, <br/>\nDH <br/>\nneeds to do something other then watch TV in the morning hours while <br/>\nI <br/>\nwork, so that Rory has a better... example? model? more stimulating <br/>\nenvironment?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also suggest not to worry about how much TV is watched, TV<br/>\nitself can be really stimulating and lead to lots of conversations<br/>\nand other activities.  With Rory being only 5, that seems very young<br/>\nto be worrying so much about what he fills his time with, as long as<br/>\nhe is happy. Have you read Sandra&#39;s pages regarding &quot;strewing&quot;.  I<br/>\nstrongly suggest you do that; you see you could &quot;strew&quot; lots of <br/>\ninteresting things around the room where your DH is watching<br/>\nTV and if Rory takes interest in them, surely your DH will then<br/>\nnotice that spark of interest and build conversation around that, <br/>\nanswering his questions and you may be surprised just where this <br/>\ncould lead them.<br/>\nAfter all, the important thing to note here is that unschooling is<br/>\nall about what Rory chooses to do with his time and, like you said, <br/>\nhe may not want to bake bread, do crafts or read at this stage - <br/>\nthen again, he might and are you sure your DH wouldn&#39;t want to do <br/>\nthese things with him? Have you asked him?  <br/>\n<br/>\nHow does Rory spend his time during school holidays and weekends?  <br/>\nThat is good clue to what interests him.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could change your working hours so that you got up early <br/>\nand worked for a few hours, then had a large portion of time during <br/>\nthe middle of the day where you could take Rory out places, and then <br/>\nfinish your work in the evening when it usually seems quite <br/>\nthe &quot;norm&quot; for Dads and kids to be watching TV.  That all depends of <br/>\ncourse on how much work you have to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a thought, hope something helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279971515,"authorName":"Redomestication.com","from":"&quot;Redomestication.com&quot; &lt;redomestication@...&gt;","profile":"redomestication","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] WAH + Unschooling?

He <br/>\nwatches a lot of TV these days. I don&#39;t want Rory to be bored to death <br/>\nat home because mom is working for, say, 5 hours a day and DH is <br/>\nwatching TV during that time.  That was my initial fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd maybe it&#39;s unfounded???  Maybe the &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; will disappear with <br/>\nunschooling.

It&#39;s just the darn <br/>\nTV seems to take precedence on most days.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I think of us unschooling, I don&#39;t see the way our days are now as <br/>\nbeing at all enriching and fun and interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd maybe that&#39;s my perception, maybe that&#39;s MY being school-y (or, uh, <br/>\ncontrolling).  I.E. &quot;I would do a craft and read books and bake bread&quot; <br/>\nor whatever if I was with them in the morning, and DH doesn&#39;t, so I&#39;m <br/>\nthinking DH&#39;s way is &quot;wrong.&quot;  In reality, Rory may have no interest on <br/>\ndoing those things with me on any particular day...  And in reality, I&#39;d <br/>\nprobably never get as much done as I think or fantasize that I could, LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey watch movies and talk about them.  They play video games sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I should relax a bit on the whole, &quot;What&#39;s DH going to *do* with <br/>\nRory all day if we unschooled?&quot; and focus on getting a decent workflow <br/>\nscheduled with DH so he and I are working together well in that <br/>\ndepartment... and perhaps once that&#39;s where it should be, the rest will <br/>\nfall into place.<br/>\n<br/>\nI worry that Rory won&#39;t be &quot;doing&quot; enough during his time with DH if we <br/>\nwere unschooling.  But in writing this, I see that they do... It just <br/>\nisn&#39;t necessarily the stuff *I* would pick.<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I headed in a reasonable direction here, or am I getting off course?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, don&#39;t overlook the fact that<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; society at large makes it tough for men to be primaries.

Totally ruined the effect when they then charged off to<br/>\nhave a pillow fight. =)  Rowan and I discussed what &quot;bored&quot; actually<br/>\nmeans, and he was surprised. He was using the term because he liked<br/>\nthe feeling, the word sound, but didn&#39;t understand the implications.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I feel like if I have an open-door policy while I&#39;m working, then I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; never going to get any work done because I&#39;ll be interrupted every 10<br/>\n&gt; minutes.  If I have a closed door policy for, say, 5 hours a day, then<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not being available to him, not partnering, and that doesn&#39;t seem<br/>\n&gt; very unschooling, from my understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith age and practice, there gets to be a rhythm. But if your spouse<br/>\nrespects your space, the kids will pick up on it, and model it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Yes, baby is still nursing on demand.  Husband is bored to death,<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the husband is the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; watches TV all day while baby crawls about and explores,<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the husband isn&#39;t actually interacting with the kids?<br/>\n<br/>\ncomes upstairs<br/>\n&gt; and wants to talk to me to get some adult interaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh. Yeah, I see where you&#39;re having issues. He needs to do what SAHMs<br/>\nhave done since time immemorial; reach out, go to parks and<br/>\nplaygroups, and not lay *everything* on your shoulders. It&#39;s a gift<br/>\nthat you&#39;re able to be there at all, and when everyone sees that, it<br/>\nchanges the tone and flavor of the whole thing to be a more mutually<br/>\nassistive kind of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr baby gets a<br/>\n&gt; bit cranky and husband brings him up to nurse even though he&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; really hungry, DH just wants a few minutes to himself to regroup or<br/>\n&gt; whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes he understand that he&#39;s putting you in the position of having to<br/>\ndo everything? That&#39;s not real respectful.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t want to come up with this great &quot;idea&quot; of unschooling, convince<br/>\n&gt; my husband it&#39;s the thing to do, and then leave him to it all while I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; working.  Particurally since my 5 y/o isn&#39;t his son.  It&#39;s like, &quot;Here,<br/>\n&gt; this is cool - you do it, I have other things to do.&quot;  That&#39;s not nice.<br/>\n&gt;   I want to find a way - schedule-wise - that we&#39;re partners.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am really really confused here. I could be totally wrong, since the<br/>\nwhole unschooling mindset is pretty new for me, but it seems to me<br/>\nthat either you&#39;re a family all pulling together, or you are not, and<br/>\nif you aren&#39;t, there are a number of things that won&#39;t work optimally.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone&#39;s got to make money. Implicit in the decision for that someone<br/>\nto be you is the decision that someone needs to be primary caregiver<br/>\nto the children, and that someone is him. If he isn&#39;t stepping up to<br/>\nthe plate, that&#39;s a huge problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Besides, part of the goal, to me, is being with my boy more.  I missed a<br/>\n&gt; lot of him when he was younger because I had no choice but to go the<br/>\n&gt; daycare/preschool route.<br/>\n<br/>\nGotcha.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I think the biggest thing is that I need to get DH on board giving me<br/>\n&gt; uninterrupted work time each day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 45 minute thing worked well for us when Kestrel was nursing (his<br/>\nnatural interval was longer than that, so I was offering before<br/>\nhunger), and then it gradually increased over time.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; If I accomplish just a bit, I&#39;d feel much more comfortable leaving for<br/>\n&gt; the day and being really *with* them.  I often find myself trying to<br/>\n&gt; enjoy a book, movie, whatever as a family and instead thinking of all<br/>\n&gt; the stuff left undone that day.  So I&#39;m not really as present as I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; like to be.<br/>\n<br/>\n::nodding:: Of course. I find it to be an excellent exercise in<br/>\nmindfulness. Be here now... whether here is with my work when I&#39;m<br/>\nworking, or with my kids when I&#39;m not.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I think my 5 y/o (and husband) sense that.<br/>\n<br/>\nhow could they not? most likely the baby does too.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I should add my 5 y/o has an in-and-out biological dad who comes and<br/>\n&gt; goes, like the wind... DS is going through a tough emotional time about<br/>\n&gt; that right now, he&#39;s recently developed a much keener sense of time and<br/>\n&gt; realizes when Dad doesn&#39;t call, or that&#39;s it&#39;s been months since he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; seen him.  It&#39;s making him a lot more needy of me, the security he gets<br/>\n&gt; from mom, so what I&#39;m experiencing with him RIGHT NOW - the every 10<br/>\n&gt; minutes needing me thing, isn&#39;t the norm that I will have to deal with<br/>\n&gt; in terms of working forever...<br/>\n<br/>\nTry for mental isolation rather than physical, then. Try setting up a<br/>\n&quot;workstation&quot; right next to you, or in your office space, where<br/>\nthere&#39;s a laptop, or pens, pencils, crayons, paper, a stapler, paper<br/>\nclips, other cool office supply things. Let him know that you need to<br/>\nfocus on work but you&#39;d love having him with you. I got interrupted a<br/>\nton in the beginning, but now, the boys totally get the difference<br/>\nbetween &quot;head down&quot; and &quot;available for stuff&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; You have my highest respect for doing all that you do!  I&#39;ll get there<br/>\n&gt; too, soon enough!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be a little hard to start. Also, don&#39;t overlook the fact that<br/>\nsociety at large makes it tough for men to be primaries. My DH is very<br/>\ncomfortable in his role, and was pretty much born to be a father, but<br/>\nthe unconscious and pretty unbelievable comments people have made to<br/>\nhim sometimes knock him pretty hard. I like to think that some day,<br/>\nequality and respect will be givens. But right now, like it or not,<br/>\nmen as primaries are really unusual, and are going to take some knocks<br/>\nfor it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~L!<br/>\n<br/>\n~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~<br/>\nWriting here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theexcellentadventure.com/\">http://www.theexcellentadventure.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lifewithoutschool.typepad.com/\">http://lifewithoutschool.typepad.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPublishing here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://huntpress.com/\">http://huntpress.com/</a><br/>\n~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":217568290,"authorName":"Laureen","from":"Laureen &lt;splashing@...&gt;","profile":"elementalgrrl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] WAH + Unschooling?

Even <br/>\nstacking wood, he loves it.  He&#39;s a very outdoorsy, active boy, and I <br/>\nlike to sit and read, LOL.  So I am so grateful to have such an amazing <br/>\nman to help my boy grow into a man in a way I never could.<br/>\n<br/>\nDH often talks about how he can&#39;t wait for our 1 y/o DS to get just a <br/>\nbit bigger so he can come on their outing more often, and they can do <br/>\nmore things together.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I just need to sit down with DH and draw up a schedule.  We&#39;ve <br/>\ntalked about, &quot;I need more uninterrupted work time,&quot; but I think his <br/>\nidea of that and mine are vastly different.  Or, sometimes, he&#39;ll go <br/>\noverboard and leave me be for 10 hours of the day, and then next day <br/>\nreally need my support/help parenting.  I don&#39;t need all that.

Husband is bored to death, <br/>\nwatches TV all day while baby crawls about and explores, comes upstairs <br/>\nand wants to talk to me to get some adult interaction.  Or baby gets a <br/>\nbit cranky and husband brings him up to nurse even though he&#39;s not <br/>\nreally hungry, DH just wants a few minutes to himself to regroup or <br/>\nwhatever.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; When my boys were tiny, I had office space away from the main room of<br/>\n &gt; the house, and I was offlimits for 45 minutes of the hour.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is good - I like this!<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to come up with this great &quot;idea&quot; of unschooling, convince <br/>\nmy husband it&#39;s the thing to do, and then leave him to it all while I&#39;m <br/>\nworking.  Particurally since my 5 y/o isn&#39;t his son.  It&#39;s like, &quot;Here, <br/>\nthis is cool - you do it, I have other things to do.&quot;  That&#39;s not nice. <br/>\n  I want to find a way - schedule-wise - that we&#39;re partners.<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, part of the goal, to me, is being with my boy more.  I missed a <br/>\nlot of him when he was younger because I had no choice but to go the <br/>\ndaycare/preschool route.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the biggest thing is that I need to get DH on board giving me <br/>\nuninterrupted work time each day.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I accomplish just a bit, I&#39;d feel much more comfortable leaving for <br/>\nthe day and being really *with* them.  I often find myself trying to <br/>\nenjoy a book, movie, whatever as a family and instead thinking of all <br/>\nthe stuff left undone that day.  So I&#39;m not really as present as I&#39;d <br/>\nlike to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think my 5 y/o (and husband) sense that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI should add my 5 y/o has an in-and-out biological dad who comes and <br/>\ngoes, like the wind... DS is going through a tough emotional time about <br/>\nthat right now, he&#39;s recently developed a much keener sense of time and <br/>\nrealizes when Dad doesn&#39;t call, or that&#39;s it&#39;s been months since he&#39;s <br/>\nseen him.  It&#39;s making him a lot more needy of me, the security he gets <br/>\nfrom mom, so what I&#39;m experiencing with him RIGHT NOW - the every 10 <br/>\nminutes needing me thing, isn&#39;t the norm that I will have to deal with <br/>\nin terms of working forever...<br/>\n<br/>\nLaureen, I really appreciate your input - sounds like we&#39;re in similar <br/>\nsituations.  My DH just can&#39;t make as much as I do, and now that we&#39;ve <br/>\nmoved rural, can&#39;t make much at all (until we get his independent <br/>\nbusiness going more).  And that&#39;s fine - I&#39;ve no problem with the <br/>\nrole-reversal, I like my job, that&#39;s why I picked it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have my highest respect for doing all that you do!

We made the decision for me to be the<br/>\nprimary, because 1) I telecommute, so I have maximal flexibility, 2) I<br/>\ncan make more than DH, and 3) my work isn&#39;t as hard on my body as his<br/>\nis (he&#39;s a general contractor by training).<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; that a parent-from-birth does.  My husband isn&#39;t into school or<br/>\n&gt; bookwork, and sees much more value in day-to-day learning by doing,<br/>\n&gt; which is awesome.  But I also feel like it&#39;ll be more my job (and<br/>\n&gt; reasonably so) to be with the 5 year old, encouraging, strewing about<br/>\n&gt; interesting things, being with him and helping him...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt tends to be more my job to find opportunities. Free museum days,<br/>\nnature walks, festivals and presentations and park days and that kind<br/>\nof thing. But finding formal stuff to do, isn&#39;t nearly as important as<br/>\npaying enough attention to see what sparks there are *in them*.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;d been in<br/>\n&gt; preschool before K, and needs guidance to find things to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat may well be an assumption that needs questioning.<br/>\n<br/>\n I think<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s somewhat used to having an adult saying, &quot;Now we&#39;re coloring.  Now<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;re doing worksheets.&quot; etc. and isn&#39;t as able to entertain himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you given him that space?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; So I will need to be there with him, for him, to keep his days<br/>\n&gt; interesting and entertaining and full of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might really want to step back from that. Kids learn so many<br/>\nimplicit lessons, just by being, and one of the things you&#39;re showing<br/>\nhim is that you don&#39;t necessarily trust your husband to be a competent<br/>\nnurturer/role model, and that your work isn&#39;t something worthy of<br/>\nfocus.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I also just feel like it&#39;s so not right - not sending a good message -<br/>\n&gt; that my husband, myself and the littlest one stay home and the oldest<br/>\n&gt; gets trucked off to school.  It feels separate, icky.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hear that. I have been snarling at people who insist I send Rowan to<br/>\npreschool for over two years now.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure how to do unschooling while also working at home.  I<br/>\n&gt; already don&#39;t get enough done with my husband and the baby needing me<br/>\n&gt; throughout the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my boys were tiny, I had office space away from the main room of<br/>\nthe house, and I was offlimits for 45 minutes of the hour. I&#39;d come<br/>\ncheck in every 45, nurse, potty, etc. Then back to the grind. If<br/>\nyou&#39;re the breadwinner, you have to focus.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; But sometimes I feel like I&#39;d get so much more done<br/>\n&gt; if they would just LEAVE ME ALONE for a few uninterrupted hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrin. I hear that one. At this stage, Rowan and Kestrel both recognize<br/>\nthat if I have a headset on, it means I&#39;m in a meeting and they need<br/>\nto be quiet. I know another telecommuting mama who wears her badge,<br/>\nand that&#39;s her children&#39;s signal that Mama is working, and to be<br/>\ninterrupted only in direst emergency.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of this presupposes total trust in the child&#39;s caregiver, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I feel<br/>\n&gt; like if I had a few hours, no interruptions, I could get the day&#39;s work<br/>\n&gt; done and I would then have the rest of the day to focus on my family,<br/>\n&gt; exploring, .<br/>\n<br/>\nSo why can&#39;t you? Is your baby still nursing?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I work on the computer, it&#39;s very solo work and not something I can do<br/>\n&gt; *with* anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hear that. I&#39;m a technical editor, and that&#39;s work that doesn&#39;t<br/>\nshare well. On the other hand, I&#39;ve had great success in setting up<br/>\nanother laptop right next to mine, and putting games, youtube, and<br/>\nDVDs on it. Sometimes, what they want is to do what you&#39;re doing. So<br/>\nyou enable that. Rowan&#39;s learned most of what he knows about typing by<br/>\nsitting next to me with a blank word processing document in front of<br/>\nhim, trying to do what I do.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; So, what I&#39;m asking for is any experience or stories from BTDT<br/>\n&gt; unschooling moms who are also engaged in a home business.  How do you<br/>\n&gt; balance being with your kids with your work?  Is it possible?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s something I wrote on this:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lifewithoutschool.typepad.com/lifewithoutschool/2007/07/day-of-a-thousa.html\">http://lifewithoutschool.typepad.com/lifewithoutschool/2007/07/day-of-a-thousa.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n I see<br/>\n&gt; this as our biggest obstacle to unschooling, so I would appreciate any<br/>\n&gt; thoughts you can give.  I&#39;m terrified that I&#39;ll make the leap - with a<br/>\n&gt; &quot;We&#39;ll make it work&quot; attitude, and I&#39;ll find I&#39;m NOT getting work done,<br/>\n&gt; NOT making money, and, well, we won&#39;t be able to pay the bills.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou totally need spousal support and communication, and it helps if<br/>\nyou guys are wired in parallel with regards to your priorities. Mutual<br/>\nrespect is absolutely critical. And here&#39;s something I wrote on that:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lifewithoutschool.typepad.com/lifewithoutschool/2007/02/the_crooked_law.html\">http://lifewithoutschool.typepad.com/lifewithoutschool/2007/02/the_crooked_law.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Also, because I did work outside the home for a long time, as a single<br/>\n&gt; parent, (that&#39;s why the oldest started preschool originally) I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; honestly totally confused as to what the heck we would do all day.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh my gosh. Calvin (and Hobbes) was right... the days are just packed.<br/>\nFollow an interest, see where it takes you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMost<br/>\n&gt; of our weekend time is relaxed, spent decompressing from the week.  We<br/>\n&gt; sometimes go on a little day trip to somewhere interesting.  But I&#39;m at<br/>\n&gt; a loss as to what my 5 year old would DO all day.  He has games, toys,<br/>\n&gt; books, TV, 5 acres to run around on.  But even on a weekend - or, heck,<br/>\n&gt; an evening - he gets bored.  So I really don&#39;t know how I would fill his<br/>\n&gt; day - or help him fill it with stuff he&#39;s interested in, for that<br/>\n&gt; matter.  Again, any tips/ideas would be so appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat exactly is your husband doing with them? Does he understand strewing?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing that might be helpful, at least from where I sit, is<br/>\nthat our culture is very into the idea that every moment must be spent<br/>\nin doing, rather than just in being. Sometimes, Rowan wants to be left<br/>\nalone, to sit on his bunk and stare at the ceiling. He&#39;s not<br/>\ninterested in toys, games, movies, walks, anything. He needs time to<br/>\ndecompress, to think, to integrate. It&#39;s easy for a schoolish brain to<br/>\npanic at that point. But inevitably, he&#39;s processing big stuff, and<br/>\ncomes out wanting to talk about whatever he&#39;s been pondering. It&#39;s<br/>\ncritical time for him, that looks very much like &quot;nothing&quot; but is in<br/>\nfact everything.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s VERY social, loves to be with other children, but there are no<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling groups in our area (although I&#39;m sure there are<br/>\n&gt; homeschoolers... I just don&#39;t know where to find them).  We would have<br/>\n&gt; to drive about an hour to find one.  Plus, we live in a fairly remote<br/>\n&gt; area, so access to zoos, &quot;field trip&quot; kind of places, is limited without<br/>\n&gt; a long drive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are tons of resources out there to help you find homeschooling groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m finding that formal &quot;field trip&quot; stuff is not where it&#39;s at, with<br/>\nmy kids. There&#39;s a place out behind the local racetrack where a bunch<br/>\nof folks have made found-material sculpture. You&#39;d never know it was<br/>\nthere unless you stumbled into it, which is what my brother in law<br/>\ndid, while looking for a good place to let the dog run free. He took<br/>\nthe kids there yesterday, and they spent probably six straight hours<br/>\nexploring sculpture, how it was put together, which ones were stable,<br/>\nwhich fell down and why, how people picked what they were going to<br/>\nmake, what kinds of stuff the boys wanted to make, what materials were<br/>\naround, where they might scrounge other materials, why people made<br/>\nstuff like that (what motivates art), why there&#39;s driftwood and<br/>\nflotsam and jetsam right there on that beach anyway (which apparently<br/>\nled to a discussion of Bay currents)... on and on and on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s totally doable. You just need the right infrastructure. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~L!<br/>\n<br/>\n~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~<br/>\nWriting here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theexcellentadventure.com/\">http://www.theexcellentadventure.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lifewithoutschool.typepad.com/\">http://lifewithoutschool.typepad.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPublishing here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://huntpress.com/\">http://huntpress.com/</a><br/>\n~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":144007756,"authorName":"Estella Schmelter","from":"Estella Schmelter &lt;proudwahm@...&gt;","profile":"proudwahm","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] WAH + Unschooling?

Maybe I had my head stuck in the sand, (not that <br/>\nthere is much sand near Birmingham in the Midlands, where we came <br/>\nfrom).  It just never occurred to me that there was an alternative <br/>\nto the schooling production line that I was so used to.  It wasn&#39;t <br/>\nuntil they were a little older (aged 6 and 8),and we were living in <br/>\nthe US, that they started to really show signs of being <br/>\nuncomfortable and unhappy with school; and the more I looked into <br/>\nit, the more unacceptable it seemed to be to me too.  Then, the very <br/>\nfirst example of homeschooling we were exposed to appeared to be <br/>\njust as controlling and offensive as being in school, so we just <br/>\nstopped doing it.  Then, as if by magic, my kids just started to do <br/>\ninteresting and worthwhile things, having fun and being natural, <br/>\nwithout any intervention from me other than taking them places and <br/>\nproviding answers to questions etc.  Feeling guilty, and as if I was <br/>\ndoing them a disservice, I did plenty of internet research and <br/>\ndiscovered that this was unschooling - and even better, it was <br/>\nperfectly legal and &quot;allowed&quot;.

Being American and knowing my family, she knew more of the  <br/>\ndifferences in the U.S. but she wasn&#39;t aware that unschooling was the  <br/>\nsmall minority method.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere, for several reasons it seems to me (from the outside, from  <br/>\ncorrespondence and comments and stories) the mainstream is more like  <br/>\nunschooling, although it&#39;s called autonomous education.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause the Church of England is both state church and kind of  <br/>\nsecular religion, they don&#39;t have the focus on &quot;what church do you go  <br/>\nto&quot; that so much of the U.S. has.  Those who were unschooling in the  <br/>\n70&#39;s were doing it pretty quietly, and scattered out except for  <br/>\ncontact through  Growing Without Schooling, John Holt&#39;s publication  <br/>\n(a newsletter, more than anything).   When the fundamentalists got  <br/>\nseparatist enough to want to pull their kids out of school, a whole  <br/>\nindustry sprang up of Christian curriculae, materials, a &quot;legal  <br/>\nprotection&quot; company (HSLDA), then rival publications and conferences,  <br/>\nand politics, and a college or two for homeschooled Christian kids  <br/>\nwho want to take over the government...  all of that VERY loud and  <br/>\nthreatening and in the faces of lots of people, including secular  <br/>\nhomeschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe UK doesn&#39;t seem to have that.<br/>\n<br/>\nParents aren&#39;t as awful to their kids in England as American parents  <br/>\nbecame in the course of the growth of the U.S.  The protestant  <br/>\nbeliefs and prejudices that came from the colonists linger still.    <br/>\nThere is something concerning children&#39;s safety and rights on which  <br/>\nthe U.S. agrees only with Somalia.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a> <br/>\nConvention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother American friend of mine attended school in England  <br/>\n(Cambridge) when she was 15, in the late 1970&#39;s.
