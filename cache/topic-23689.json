Yes that is something we strive for and <br/>\nfor the most part accomplish.  What came to mind when reading <br/>\nmaryanne&#39;s post is I was raised by a mother who yelled and hit and <br/>\ndid all sorts of stuff but I don&#39;t use her as my role modle no <br/>\nmatter how you are &quot;ingrained&quot;.  Very early on in my life I had a <br/>\nfriend&#39;s mother who I just dissided that she did things &quot;right&quot; and <br/>\nI still try to modle myself after her.  Surely there is someone <br/>\nsomewhere who you could think of instead of your mother when in a <br/>\nsituation where you are just going to &quot;lose it&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso while I was reading the posts my daughter was playing baby at <br/>\nmy feet and just listening to the way she plays baby makes me so <br/>\nproud.  She uses a kind voice while talking to her baby and is very <br/>\ngental in her actions.   YOur daughter or son will most likely look <br/>\nto you first as a role model on how to act with other&#39;s in general.  <br/>\nThe way you treat you children will be a service to so many others <br/>\nthan just your children.  It is important to take parenting and <br/>\nrearing as seriously as you can.  Nobody thought it was possible to <br/>\nrun a 4(?)minute mile until it was done and now it has been done <br/>\nmany times.<br/>\n<br/>\njean</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23676,"nextTopicId":23695}}
