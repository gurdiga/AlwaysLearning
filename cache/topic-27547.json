Don&#39;t know why you can&#39;t see it???<br/>\n~Crystal<br/>\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>\n<br/>\nFound this in an article under &quot;24/7&quot; -- I think it has some good <br/>\nideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is a Strong-Willed Child? Kendra Smiley defines strong-willed <br/>\nchildren as<br/>\nthose who know how they want the world to be run and have no <br/>\ntolerance for<br/>\nanyone who disagrees with their viewpoint. The strong-willed child is <br/>\nvery<br/>\npersistent and is willing to take punishment in order to win on any <br/>\ngiven issue.<br/>\nBecause they are gifted in manipulation, strong-willed children are <br/>\nnot always<br/>\novertly defiant. They can be quite subtle, and even charming, in <br/>\ntheir attempts<br/>\nto control. They are willing to and capable of causing emotional <br/>\nupset in order<br/>\nto gain the upper hand. Strong-willed children don&#39;t necessarily want <br/>\nto control<br/>\neveryone around them. They just don&#39;t want to be controlled by anyone <br/>\nelse.<br/>\nDiscipline: Calm is Better! Discipline is a key issue when it comes <br/>\nto molding a<br/>\nstrong-willed child. Smiley advises setting clear expectations and <br/>\nconsequences.<br/>\nWhen expectations are violated, be sure to be consistent in <br/>\ndiscipline.<br/>\nAccording to Smiley, parents who cancel punishments midstream are<br/>\n&quot;short-sighted.&quot; Further, when disciplining strong-willed kids, <br/>\ncontrol your<br/>\nemotions. Don&#39;t discipline in anger. Kendra says, &quot;An out-of-control <br/>\nadult is<br/>\nnot effective and is usually counterproductive. When we (as parents) <br/>\ngo out of<br/>\ncontrol, the strong-willed child wins the battle.&quot; In fact, Kendra&#39;s <br/>\nson, Aaron,<br/>\na strong-willed child when growing up, claims that discipline worked <br/>\nbest when<br/>\nit was unemotional. Anger in discipline was a sure sign to him that <br/>\nhe needed to<br/>\ndig in his own heels. Our goal is to raise our kids to become <br/>\nresponsible<br/>\nadults. It&#39;s hard. Parents need to take time to focus, to remind <br/>\nthemselves that<br/>\nthey are, in fact, the parents. It&#39;s not your calling to be your <br/>\nchild&#39;s<br/>\n&quot;friend.&quot; It&#39;s your high calling and privilege to be your child&#39;s <br/>\nparent. With a<br/>\nstrong-willed child, choosing battles wisely is important - but so is <br/>\nthe<br/>\ncorollary: Be sure to win battles you&#39;ve chosen to fight. Smiley <br/>\nbelieves that<br/>\nmoms and dads need to provide a unified front when it comes to <br/>\nparenting<br/>\nstrong-willed kids. Some conflict and disagreement when it comes to <br/>\nparenting is<br/>\nnormal between parents, but Smiley advises that moms and dads not <br/>\ndisagree on<br/>\nparenting issues in front of the strong-willed child. The strong-<br/>\nwilled child is<br/>\nvery attentive to differences in how Mom and Dad handle parenting <br/>\nissues. As a<br/>\nresult, parents who don&#39;t &quot;sing from the same sheet of music&quot; can open<br/>\nthemselves up to instances where their child will play one parent off <br/>\nthe other<br/>\nin his or her efforts to gain control.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27512,"nextTopicId":27561}}
