You ve turned","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-23824539\">You&#39;re in the midst of a big transitional period and transitions are hard - even harder for little kids. Its natural to expect some upheavals. You&#39;ve turned your kids&#39; lives upside down, adding another person to their world, a person who is taking up a lot of your time and attention. To help your older kids, find more ways to fill them up and say yes to them so they aren&#39;t having to wait for  your time and love. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think I have been through this before with my oldest.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not surprising, especially give this list:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;chuckie cheese (my 3 yo terrified of the mouse), monkey joes (my 3 yo afraid of enclosed bouncy things and the monkey),  sledding (baby hates hats, hoods, and cold), <br/>\n </span></blockquote>********************<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you saying &quot;no&quot; to your 5yo and backing that up with the needs of your other kids? If that&#39;s how it seems to her, no wonder she&#39;d resent them. Find more ways to say &quot;yes&quot; to her! Are there friends she can go out with - to those places and to do those things? Alternately, are there friends the 3yo can play with while you take the eldest and the baby to loud, busy places without her?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My 5 yo started shushing the baby when she was crying and getting close to her face in a threatening way (however she tried to appear as though it was playful).<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*********************j<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it was playful. Maybe she&#39;s trying to be helpful - that&#39;s not uncommon for eldest children, to start to assume some responsibility for babies. Offer her ways to help - say yes to her helpfulness, rather than framing it negatively. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I am guessing that tomorrow when I tell her it is a good time to go out in the back to sled she will say, &quot;no thanks&quot;. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>****************<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she&#39;s busy doing something else and not in the mood to sled in that moment, then of course she will - she&#39;s little. Its unrealistic on your part to expect her to put her desires on standby until &quot;a good time&quot; comes around. Its not realistic to expect her to wait graciously. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes its possible to say yes and be positive even with a wait involved, but it takes some work and practice on your part - and it depends somewhat on personality. I used to be able to say, to Morgan &quot;yes, we&#39;ll do that as soon as...&quot; and keep up a level of excitement, offer Mo ways to prepare and be ready so that waiting was enthusiastic anticipation - but it took a loooooot of input on my part to keep things from falling into frustrated waiting. It might be trickier with two kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nHave lots of other things to offer all day long, right from the start of the day. I don&#39;t know how you&#39;re nursing, but you may have to adjust the logistics so that you can tote baby around with you while you&#39;re doing other things with the kids - don&#39;t expect down time while you nurse this one, for sure! If baby needs you to sit, then set up something fun you can facilitate sitting. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] More on deschooling/relationship/jealousy","postDate":"1295082744","msgId":58938,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMyNjE2OS4xODk2OC5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDcubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDExMzEzMTkzOTUuMTk4Ny4xMjk1MDYxMDA1ODA1LkphdmFNYWlsLnNldmVuQGFwMS5wMC5zamMuN3N5cy5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDExMzEzMTkzOTUuMTk4Ny4xMjk1MDYxMDA1ODA1LkphdmFNYWlsLnNldmVuQGFwMS5wMC5zamMuN3N5cy5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":58937,"nextInTopic":58942,"prevInTime":58937,"nextInTime":58939,"topicId":58935,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***It seems like she is seeing the glass as half empty.

It seems to me that a major crux in<br/>\ngetting unschooling is to see the need for attention as very normal and part<br/>\nof the drive in children to keep the parent/child connection alive and<br/>\nbreathing and well. Once a child gives up and ceases asking for attention,<br/>\nit may signal estrangement or the beginning of disconnection that will need<br/>\nhealing.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake heart in this seeming overage of attention-seeking behavior. It means<br/>\nthe desire and ability that makes unschooling work exist in your family. The<br/>\npotential for greater connection and living and learning is there, ready to<br/>\nbe tapped into. One of the many things your children (and YOU) will learn is<br/>\nhow this attention-need works for you all, what it does for your family<br/>\ndynamics, and how to create peace from that seemingly chaotic need/drive.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s like the electricity that powers unschooling in your family.
