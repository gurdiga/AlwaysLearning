For some reason I have to post from the web as my dsl company<br/>\nwont let me post to yahoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nA number of things I&#39;ll get into this email....<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly, we are considering moving to Colorado Springs next year. I<br/>\nread the HS laws and it seems easier than Virginia with testing every<br/>\ntwo years instead of every year. Mind you, I wont be in any rush to<br/>\ntell any official I am there ;-)<br/>\nAny tips from any residents, especially for secular support groups.<br/>\nOnes that would take brits with spiky pink hair and boys with long<br/>\nhair :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m off camping in mid-June to upstate New York (adirondacks, Niagara)<br/>\nand then to Colorado Springs in August so if there&#39;s anyone who&#39;d like<br/>\nto meet me, let me camp in their yard, lend me a house with servants<br/>\nand a swimming pool...let me know. It would be nice to meet other<br/>\nunschoolers cos they are a rarity here in north Virginia. Rarer than<br/>\nhen&#39;s teeth :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt some point during all this I&#39;m also going by train to San Fransisco<br/>\n(get that coffee ready Meghan...).<br/>\n<br/>\nI reckonn after all this we&#39;d have covered United States geography 101 :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, and this is a tad off topic, any recommendations to keep ticks<br/>\nat bay? My 8 yo comes in from the yard with a tick nearly every day.<br/>\nThis is surburban middle class Virgina!! Not deep forest!! It&#39;s<br/>\ndriving me nuts. I have a real phobia about them and my husband has to<br/>\nremove them cos I can&#39;t bear to look :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care<br/>\n<br/>\nShyrley<br/>\n<br/>\nPS Sorry for the ramblings. I&#39;m so excited to have my computer<br/>\nfunctioning again.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6868,"nextTopicId":6964}}
