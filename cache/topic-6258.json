I haven&#39;t checked, but Melinda <br/>\nsaid that she had written here to let everyone know of Sandra&#39;s leg. I&#39;ll <br/>\nreiterate:<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra fell Friday afternoon at 4:00 on her way to her &quot;Moving  A Puddle&quot; <br/>\nkeynote speach and fell (at a puddle! ) and broke both her tibia and fibula <br/>\nright above her right ankle. She had sugery today at noon. She&#39;s doing fine <br/>\nand they&#39;ll probably release her tomorrow morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve moved the schedule around, and other speakers have taken her spots <br/>\nleaving a space (that&#39;s fillable, if we need to) for her at 10:00 tomorrow. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s mostly miserable, I think, that she&#39;s letting me down and that so many <br/>\nfolks came from SOOO far away to see her speak---and she&#39;s letting them down. <br/>\nMostly everyone is just plain worried about her. She&#39;s seeing some of the <br/>\nregular posters at her hospital room--Ren and Tuck and Karin, and Mary <br/>\n(Zenmomma), and Priss---among others have been up to see her to cheer her up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings are going well, despite the major trauma. Everyone has picked up the <br/>\nslack.Overall the conference is going quite well. I&#39;m happy. But this has <br/>\nbeen the major trauma.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;ll be waiting to hear from all of you!<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":9440128,"authorName":"ElissaJC@concentric.net","from":"&lt;ElissaJC@...&gt;","profile":"elissajc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"SC conference","postDate":"1019160740","msgId":6258,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjAwMWMxZTcxNSQ1OTkyYjFjMCQxMDNiYWRjZUBFbGlzc2FKQz4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":9842,"prevInTime":6257,"nextInTime":6259,"topicId":6258,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Gabrielle is going to be at the unschooling conference!!!!
