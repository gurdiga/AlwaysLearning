There were some sweet stories about kids <br/>\nhelping with groceries, and being helpful without being asked or ever coerced.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight as I was reading it, my daughter, who is 7, came over and offered me a <br/>\nfoot rub. With lotion. I broke my leg 10 weeks ago and still cant walk on it. <br/>\nShe has been giving me foot rubs almost daily since then. She does a really <br/>\nfabulous job, which I tell her, of course. She also likes to tell all our <br/>\nfriends how good she is at it and how much I love it. Its very nice, and <br/>\ncompletely voluntary. Maybe she also thought it would be something to lift my <br/>\nmood, which it did, and we talked about some things  we want to do when I can <br/>\nwalk again and we had a nice moment. <br/>\n<br/>\nNancy<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://happychildhood.homeschooljournal.net\">http://happychildhood.homeschooljournal.net</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62946,"nextTopicId":62894}}
