He&#39;s supposed to one of <br/>\nthe worlds best piano players and the reason he started playing <br/>\npiano was really young because he saw the Tom and Jerry Cartoon on <br/>\nTV where Tom is playing really fast and well and it inspired him to <br/>\nbecome a professional concert player....<br/>\n<br/>\nJust shows how something I would consider uninspiring (Tom and <br/>\nJerry) is so inspiring for someone else!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nLoved what those of you who have been self directed learners for <br/>\nyears had to say and to question....
