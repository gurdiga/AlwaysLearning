We<br/>\nhad a maid that cleaned and did our laundry. I left home not knowing how to<br/>\ncook or clean. Today and almost any day of the week you can literally eat<br/>\noff my floors.

My point is<br/>\nthat, in my experience, forcing chores on a child will not ensure that they<br/>\nlearn anything of value and they may often see housework as drudgery and<br/>\nsomething to be avoided. I do ask my children to help me by cleaning up<br/>\nafter themselves and most of the time they do.

If I have a problem with the messes it is *MY*<br/>\nproblem. I have no right to push my issues or discomfort on others. I want<br/>\nmy family to have a clean and comfortable home to live in. It is my gift to<br/>\nthem. It is no longer a gift when I demand that they reciprocate.

I&#39;ve been mostly unschooling my 3 kids (8, 6, and 4) but <br/>\nstill need help in some areas.  We don&#39;t do any school work type <br/>\nthings and I think I mostly need help adjusting my attitude in other <br/>\nareas.  I am also on the unschooling basics list and have finally <br/>\nbeen making more time to read posts.  In the last couple of days <br/>\nalone some of the discussions have really made me change my attitude <br/>\ntowards chores.  I realized I have been nagging my kids about <br/>\npicking up all the stuff they leave around.  I think the main <br/>\nturning point was a couple of days ago I asked my youngest to please <br/>\npick up all the stuff he had set up around the house for his &quot;indoor <br/>\nyard sale&quot;.  His response:  &quot;But mom I haven&#39;t finished my yard sale <br/>\nyet&quot;.  I asked him if he wanted some help.  He wanted me to be a <br/>\ncustomer so I picked out several things I wanted to &quot;buy&quot;.  After <br/>\npaying for my purchase I asked him if now I could put those things <br/>\naway.  He said &quot;They are yours now so you can put them away&quot;.  My dd <br/>\ndecided she would also make purchases and then she put those things <br/>\naway.  After lunch he said he was closing up and we put the rest of <br/>\nthe things away together.  It was so much fun!  I then went into <br/>\neach room and tidied up a bit and really enjoyed thinking about <br/>\neverything they had learned from each little mess I cleared away.  <br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t even that hard working around all the legos still in use.  <br/>\nIt turned out to be a great day, the house looked so much better at <br/>\nthe end of the day and I was free of the stress from nagging about <br/>\nthe mess.  I&#39;m looking forward to more days like this.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaggy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24574,"nextTopicId":24490}}
