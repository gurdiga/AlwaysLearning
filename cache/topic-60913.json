There&#39;s a note from me below.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n****our life has always been more about being the explorers than watching the explorers****<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I was growing up, I always preferred reading about the explorers over being one of the explorers.  I missed many a meal, bedtime, sunny day, or outing � lost in a book.  I read at home � at the beach � in the woods in a tree � most everywhere I went, I read.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I was 13, my stepfather decided that he was tired of watching me waste my life away (his words) in front of, yep you guessed it � not a TV screen - but my books.  He banned me from reading anywhere but in school.  Said if he caught me reading, there�d be serious consequences.  Got rid of all of my books and my library card. <br/>\n <br/>\nTo him, books were keeping me from �experiencing life� and were making me dream big dreams and want big things � and to him that was bad.  Books were evil things in his world � the things that were preventing me from being �well rounded� � the things that were going to keep me from having a productive life.  All things he said.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I tell people I was banned from reading, they are invariably shocked.  Horrified even.  But BOOKS are so wonderful, they say.  Who could stop someone from reading BOOKS.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd the things is � all the arguments he made about books and how terrible they are � it�s the same thing people say about TV, computers, video games. <br/>\n <br/>\nBooks didn�t keep me from life.  They were part of my life.  They taught me about life.  They are part of what made me who I am today.<br/>\n <br/>\nOf course, my experience being banned from reading also is part of what made me who I am today.  I would never take something away from my child that he enjoyed.  I would never try to make him feel guilty for �wasting away� his days, when in fact he�s spending his days being happy and that�s all any of us I think can ask � that we get to spend the days we have alive being happy.<br/>\n <br/>\n... if it�s appropriate to share, I would appreciate if it could be shared anonymously ...<br/>\n If it�s not appropriate to share, I understand.  I just thought you might enjoy hearing the perspective of someone who�s been on the other side of some of the things that are in current discussion, and in whose life it wasn�t the Screen that so many people seem to fear that was the �bad guy� � it was print, which so many people seem to revere.  Two sides to every coin, indeed there are :-)<br/>\n_____________________________________<br/>\nend of anonymous quote, beginning of Sandra comment:<br/>\n_____________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom said to me several times in the same words &quot;Get your nose out of that book and go outside and play.&quot;  It wasn&#39;t said in a kind or loving way.  It was clearly conveying that books were stupid, and I was stupid, and she didn&#39;t want me to be in the house when she could have the house to herself.    I bet if anyone had questioned her about it, though, she would have found some motherly justification about the health benefits of play and sunshine.   She never mentioned that in way of explanation to me, though.  Sometimes it was behind my back, but loud enough for me to hear, &quot;Sandra&#39;s in there with her nose in a book&quot; (witheringly spoken).<br/>\n<br/>\nI liked books more than I liked my mom.

She&#39;s rarely wanted  <br/>\nanything she&#39;s seen on TV. Other kids are different. But what  <br/>\nunschoolers actually experience is that when the kids are trusted to  <br/>\nbe competent and have the opportunity to try things out, they learn  <br/>\ndiscrimination.  They learn from experience, by drawing their own  <br/>\nconclusions, that what they see on commercials is to be treated with  <br/>\nskepticism.

That&#39;s how we learn. It will help you see more clearly if you  <br/>\ndon&#39;t put TV in a special category and don&#39;t call it shading.  <br/>\nEverything contributes to how we believe the world works.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot everything we read, hear, see will be true. Not even in reality!  <br/>\nBut we&#39;re constantly checking and testing what we know against  <br/>\nanything new that comes in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently watched an old movie with Carl and Kathryn: The Vikings  <br/>\nwith Kirk Douglas. I would say most of my knowledge of early western  <br/>\nEuropean history comes from movies and novels (many of which were  <br/>\nbodice busters!). But it was surprisingly easy to pick up on what felt  <br/>\noff for the time period. When I read through the trivia and so forth  <br/>\nat IMDb and articles on Wikipedia, I had pretty much spotted what was  <br/>\naccurate and what wasn&#39;t.  I had *even* been able to pick out that the  <br/>\nsupposedly Saxon castle they went to was French. (Though I was wrong  <br/>\nabout how old the castle was.)  (They had actually done a lot of  <br/>\nresearch on the Viking part of the story, more than usual for late 50s  <br/>\nmovies (when spectacle was more important than truth).)<br/>\n<br/>\nHow is that possible? How could I have absorbed so much that&#39;s wrong  <br/>\nand yet built up a fairly accurate picture? How could I have done it  <br/>\nfrom TV when I was supposedly barely awake? Thought! Questioning! Yes,  <br/>\nfrom what I was picking up from TV. :-) That&#39;s because when creators  <br/>\nof fiction use what&#39;s accurate, it matches something else you&#39;ve  <br/>\npicked up and reinforces it as being more and more and more likely  <br/>\ntrue. When creators make stuff up, it doesn&#39;t match so you&#39;re more  <br/>\nlikely to question it.<br/>\n<br/>\n*That&#39;s* how we naturally  learn. We don&#39;t need to be fed the right  <br/>\ninformation. We turn over what comes in and think about it, create  <br/>\ntheories, test it against what else we know and against reality, and  <br/>\nlet it sit sometimes and when something stirs it up again, think about  <br/>\nit some more to see how it meshes with what else we know.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  You see things that you may not realize.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Like what specifically?

It gives you another chance to spend time with them, to connect with them over their interests and joys, and that&#39;s infinitely valuable. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246186758,"authorName":"Sarah","from":"&quot;Sarah&quot; &lt;yahoo@...&gt;","profile":"sarahlexis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Why do people say TV rots brains out?","postDate":"1304455390","msgId":61033,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlwcHBjdSszc2EwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEEzNEY4MkRELTU2N0QtNDAyNS05QzYwLTE4MUU2MDg4RjQ2OUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":61032,"nextInTopic":61034,"prevInTime":61032,"nextInTime":61034,"topicId":60913,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"JS Mill (philosopher in 17mumblemumble (I think) arguing against rules and for maximising happiness when choosing, put very briefly!) said pushpin is as good","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1279777130\">JS Mill (philosopher in 17mumblemumble (I think) arguing against rules and for maximising happiness when choosing, put very briefly!) said &#39;pushpin is as good as poetry&#39; if it produces equivilent pleasure.

How does the brain know the difference between a documentary and a sitcom? Does it really make sense that falling asleep watching a documentary is more engaging than laughing at the jokes in a sitcom or marvelling at the literary and cultural references in a cartoon? Not that all documentaries are dull enough to sleep through - but those that Aren&#39;t pull elements of structure and presentation from other kinds of television and movies. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure someone could design an experiment that would prove that tv is stultifying. It wouldn&#39;t be hard to select tired old reruns or low-grade educational programming and tape electrodes to the heads of college students only interested in the $25 they&#39;d get for sitting through the experiement, daydreaming. Given the same setup, you could prove that all great literature causes the brain to go into sleep mode.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve only ever watched movies or shows to relax, I bet that data would seem convincing, but people watch tv for reasons other than that. People regularly use television programs - fictional programs - for informational purposes. It&#39;s not *just* that they&#39;re remembering the programs wholesale, people pull out facts and information (real or not) that interest them. That&#39;s learning. People do the same thing when they read books or websites or newspapers. Learning is not less-than if you disapprove of the medium. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and I want to remember the last books I read!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Have you tried audio books? Watching a dramatization of the book? If you remember song lyrics better than print, why confine yourself to print? Why put up a wall between yourself and the way you learn best?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you went to school or were homeschooled, you were told many times that reading books is important. You&#39;ve been told that reading books is better, more significant than watching tv. You&#39;ve been told, over and over until you believed it, that reading books stimulates the imagination. Those messages lurk in the back of your mind - part of the &quot;school in your head&quot;. It&#39;s valuable to question those messages even if you adore books because your children aren&#39;t you. They may find other formats, other media, work better for them as tools to explore the world. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Why do people say TV rots brains out?","postDate":"1304455180","msgId":61021,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMzgyMC43NjExMC5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MTYubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlwcGswMytna25kQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlwcGswMytna25kQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61019,"nextInTopic":61022,"prevInTime":61020,"nextInTime":61022,"topicId":60913,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***The quote was about TV and visual media.

Was he talking about TV?   Wouldn&#39;t closing your eyes control your reality, then, too?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a zen story about a master who&#39;s sitting in a house near the ocean, and they&#39;re looking out the window.  The teacher says &quot;Make that boat disappear.&quot;  The student thinks a bit, and then reaches over and slides the screen to cover the window.    The teacher says, &quot;Ah, but you had to use your hand,&quot; and closed his eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe boat didn&#39;t really disappear, though. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the discussion at Always Learning is too irritating and someone wants to make it disappear, they can click the little box in the upper corner that will make this writing &quot;disappear,&quot; or they can leave the list, or look away or close their eyes.  But we&#39;ll still be discussing what we have observed in our own families, and it won&#39;t match much of the &quot;research&quot; done by education-degree candidates to support school.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf one&#39;s goal is to make school the most interesting thing on a child&#39;s horizon, then by all means--turn off the TV, don&#39;t give them any great picture books, avoid popular music, and close all the windows.   If one&#39;s goal is to make learning a constant condition of a child&#39;s life, then turn ON the TV, give them all the books and magazines and music they want, open the windows, explore!  Explore when you&#39;re out of the house, and explore when you&#39;re in the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what was Timothy Leary on about then, with &quot;control your eyes&quot;?   <br/>\nHe wasn&#39;t a very nice man, by the way.   If he was an unschooling dad who had been a responsible, good father, I&#39;d be more inclined to want to know what he thought about how to create an environment in which children could learn in peace and joy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":478300703,"authorName":"buttsbees","from":"&quot;buttsbees&quot; &lt;buttsbees@...&gt;","profile":"buttsbees","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Why do people say TV rots brains out?","postDate":"1304437488","msgId":61003,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlwcDd0ZytmcmpiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PERDMjAyQ0Y2LTlEQUYtNDc0Mi1COUI5LTI2NTQ2OEFBMzA3MEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":61002,"nextInTopic":61004,"prevInTime":61002,"nextInTime":61004,"topicId":60913,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have six kids, we have educated at home since birth.They are  4-15 yrs..

Those questions are important to gauging how much thought you might have put into how learning happens, and about the value of choices and openness to input.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you wrote a book about the evils of TV, would you hope people would buy it?  Would that be a tool in the creation of a consumer society?   Is repetition what builds a consumer society?  Who is building this consumer society?  Is there a governing body?

I wish it would work on other machines (and if it&#39;s out there again, someone please let me know, because I loved it).  I didn&#39;t buy a Mac because of advertising. I bought it because I had worked with one doing word processing, and when my husband offered to buy me a new computer (I had a Kaypro II before that, with a daisy wheel printer), he asked whether I&#39;d rather have a Mac or PC.

I have a memory for tunes, and if something comes with a song, I can remember it.  That&#39;s an ancient tool for putting memories in people, from psalms and proverbs to epic poems, ballads and sagas.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a few people who can remember narrative without repetition, rhyme, alliteration, rhythm or music, but not many.  So don&#39;t blame TV or Alka-Seltzer if you can&#39;t remember the last books you read.  It has nothing to do with it.  It&#39;s not like your brain&#39;s all full up.
