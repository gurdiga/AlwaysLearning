We tend to do YouTube clips in direct response to right-now questions.  He likes when I find things for him.  At the library, I&#39;ll pick up books related to current interests.

That&#39;s a good set up for &quot;expanding&quot; on an interest so I hunted out a lot of new things related to things she already likes. I got her new animation programs, a new electronic pen/tablet thing for drawing, and showed her some new sites and games on the computer. She liked the new animation programs, but by the time the tablet arrived she was totally into playing Minecraft and the tablet is currently languishing. That&#39;s not uncommon! I know from past experiences that not all the stuff I suggest will be interesting... certainly not right away. Chances are, she&#39;ll eventually get into playing with the tablet.

I know it was for me. I had already had a blog from our <br/>\nWaldorf school at home days but after realizing school at home was not working I <br/>\nstarted to blog more about my thoughts and of our transition into radical <br/>\nunschooling. I too wanted someone to &quot;show me&quot; how to unschool. This was part of <br/>\n*my* deschooling process as there is no one way on how to do it with the <br/>\nexception of being more loving and respectful to your children. It&#39;s really <br/>\nfunny for me to go back and read some of my thoughts of what I was <br/>\nthinking unschooling looked like.

I was more asking this question for the<br/>\nfuture, when we are ready to move away from deschooling.  I am trying to<br/>\nunderstand what unschooling looks like with more concrete examples.  This<br/>\nway I don&#39;t fall into the &quot;schooly&quot; trap.  I know it looks different for<br/>\neveryone, but I figured if a few people gave me some ideas on what they<br/>\nwould do for their own kids with the example I gave, it would help me to<br/>\nstart to see how this will work in our house once we are ready.  During<br/>\nthis deschooling time, I am trying to learn and read as much as I can about<br/>\nunschooling.  I have already made some mistakes by jumping in and making<br/>\nannouncements too quick, so we are working on repairing that.  I just want<br/>\nto be sure I don&#39;t do something like that again.

Instead, focus on having fun and make a conscious effort to question the word &quot;just&quot; (as in: just having fun). Much of the time, learning looks and feels like play.

He&#39;s doing just fine on his own, looking and asking and wondering. Go with that for now. The idea of &quot;expanding&quot; interests is more for times when kids seem to need something more, and that&#39;s not all the time. Sometimes what kids need is to spend time digging down deep into one specific interest.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;lately my son has been asking a lot of questions about cops and courts<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ahhh, that&#39;s your problem, you&#39;re seeing &quot;feeding&quot; an interest as &quot;expanding&quot;. That&#39;s old schoolish thinking - don&#39;t learn any more than you have to for the test kind of thinking. Answer his questions. Watch cop shows and movies if he likes that sort of thing - silly things like A Fish Called Wanda are just as good as something serious like Law and Order or To Kill a Mockingbird, especially if you live in the US. What the heck is a barrister? Do they really wear those silly wigs? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt could be fun to visit the local sheriff&#39;s department and get a tour - call and find out what they have for &quot;field trips&quot; and let them know you&#39;re homeschooling. Depending on where you live, you might see if there&#39;s a local Schutzhund training organization and if you can come see the dogs. But to an extent, it depends on what he&#39;s really interested in. He might like to become a pen pal with a prisoner. He might want to play laser tag, or cops and robbers with someone. He might want to know about political prisoners - there have been some in the news recently and that might have piqued his interest. Or he might want to have a Men In Black marathon and imagine how cops and jails would all be different if there were real space aliens causing trouble. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat kinds of questions is he asking? Start there, without trying to &quot;expand&quot; for now. If he has a lot of curiosity, it&#39;s better to let That take the lead for a bit and see where it takes y&#39;all. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":147283564,"authorName":"Jill Parmer","from":"Jill Parmer &lt;jparmer@...&gt;","profile":"jparm02","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Examples of Expanding on an Interest?","postDate":"1338676165","msgId":67452,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyREYzRUI4LUQ1RTEtNDE5RS1CNkY2LTY0QUNBREZCNjREREBmcmlpLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpxZHFlYStrdnRwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpxZHFlYStrdnRwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":67451,"nextInTopic":67462,"prevInTime":67451,"nextInTime":67453,"topicId":67441,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
