I sat and watched too.  I had run up to <br/>\nKirby&#39;s room and stuck in a tape I knew we could tape over, because the first one <br/>\nhad 20 minutes left, and then didn&#39;t go turn it off, because it would have <br/>\nwoken him up again, but we were glad.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first was the new Ninja Turtle series.  It was a story that was only in <br/>\nstorybook, never animated, the first go-round.  I recognized it because I read <br/>\nthat storybook to Kirby LOTS of times.  It had a character named Kirby, who <br/>\nhad a magic crystal and if he tied it to his pencil, what he drew came alive.  <br/>\nHe and Donatello end up in another dimension, and there&#39;s a battle which is won <br/>\nby changing drawings of Donatello and of the badguys.  The portal starts to <br/>\nclose and Donatello barely makes it back, but Kirby is trapped on the other <br/>\nside, and all Donatello has of him is a drawing of himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second I recognized it I went to tape it on Kirby&#39;s VCR which works <br/>\nbetter than mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that (maybe not RIGHT after) was a show Marty recognized from a card <br/>\ngame he has seen at Walmart next to Neopets stuff.  It&#39;s some kind of <br/>\ninterstellar wrestling federation show.  Silly, but tons of puns and food characters.  <br/>\nLots of jokes Marty appeciated because he likes wrestling and Japanese <br/>\nanimation, and there were plays on particular other games/series.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen even MORE interesting was another show with food characters.  Friday, <br/>\nHolly had been looking for Kirby&#39;s old sticker collection in his closet.  She <br/>\nwent through every box looking and finally found them, but in the process she <br/>\ncame across a spiral notebook in which he had done food characters, drawn their <br/>\nweapons and had me write down descriptions and stats and stuff for them.  She <br/>\ngot it out and read through the whole thing, and said she wished she had <br/>\nsomeone to do something like that with, because she remembered when Kirby and Marty <br/>\nwere making their food fighters.  And she wondered if Marty still had his <br/>\nnotebook too.  That was Friday. <br/>\n<br/>\nSaturday MORNING Marty and I were the only two up, this food-fighter show <br/>\ncame on, and I asked him whether he still had his notebook.  He said yes, walked <br/>\nten steps, picked it up, and handed it to me.   WOW.  I said &quot;They stole ALL <br/>\nyour ideas!&quot;  It was really a great bit of  synchronicity.  AND best of all, <br/>\nthe tape was still running in Kirby&#39;s room.  We thought.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNo, he had gotten up and wound that tape back to see what had been so <br/>\nimportant for me to record.  &lt;g&gt;  He was happily watching a Ninja Turtles story he <br/>\nknew very well, but had never seen animated until then.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Marty and Holly and I went to Walmart where he bought a couple of card <br/>\npacks for  that wrestling game.  The kids are all asleep so I can&#39;t ask more.  <br/>\nLater that night, he and Brett went back to Walmart and bought more so they <br/>\ncould learn to play it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGamer-geek serendipity.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Betsy","from":"Betsy &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: unschooling","postDate":"1055171660","msgId":14969,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNFRTRBNDRDLjc4RkNCQzgyQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PEJBWTMtRjM5OTNHaEFVVGZvbW8wMDAzZmViYkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":14968,"nextInTopic":14971,"prevInTime":14968,"nextInTime":14970,"topicId":3026,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**people s eyes open wide when i say movie-schooling!** My unschooling faith has been wavering recently, but I had a reassuring discussion with my dh who","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-139331005\">**people&#39;s eyes open wide when i say movie-schooling!**<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy unschooling faith has been wavering recently, but I had a reassuring<br/>\ndiscussion with my dh who agreed with me that our son seems to learn<br/>\nbest from videos, games and taking walks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;m always looking for more movie recommendations.

It will let you know why cooks&#39; lists don&#39;t go into <br/>\ndetail about why and how things burn, or how someone left the house and <br/>\nforgot there was bread rising until she found it the next afternoon.  Some things <br/>\naren&#39;t worth writing.  And the bad thing about lists like this is you can&#39;t <br/>\nstop me partway through with expressions of excrutiating boredom, or coughing, <br/>\nshuffling and looking at watches.  Here I go.  If you don&#39;t read it you might <br/>\nmiss something good.  Probably not, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday (Sunday) the plan had been that Keith and I would pick Holly up <br/>\nfrom an overnight party far away (25 miles) at 10:00 a.m.  We got a call that the <br/>\nmom of the party girl (an idiot, well known to me for many years, a former <br/>\nSCA student, one of the few I ever fired from apprenticeship) that she was <br/>\nbringing them into town to be picked up.  (Well, they&#39;re &quot;in town&quot; legally, but in <br/>\nnew houses way on the dusty mesa where roads aren&#39;t all finished.)<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith said he would just go, and I could stay home.  COOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason was this:  She had taken them to her ex-boyfriend&#39;s house, only <br/>\nabout four miles from here.  Only she didn&#39;t tell him she was going to do it.  <br/>\nShe just called him a 10:15 (woke him up) to say she had told people to pick <br/>\ntheir kids up (only three families, but that&#39;s three more than he had agreed to) <br/>\nand she was going to be half an hour late.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo because it was SO supremely typically socially twisted and incompetent, I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t ask any more.  He got up to greet people and say the kids would be <br/>\nthere in a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith had told Holly that she could go with him to fighter practice, and she <br/>\ncould take Kristy.  On the way home he told her he really REALLY didn&#39;t want <br/>\nto go, sorry.  Holly probably said &quot;that&#39;s okay,&quot; but she came and sat in my <br/>\nlap like a tired, sad lump.  I rocked her and kissed her head and stroked her <br/>\nhair (what&#39;s left of it--she shaved off even more of the haircut you can see at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/hollyhair\">http://sandradodd.com/hollyhair</a><br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/hollyhair&quot;\">http://sandradodd.com/hollyhair&quot;</a>&gt;Holly&#39;s April 2003 Haircut&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\nand is doing it herself now, not directing me where to cut and what to shave).<br/>\n<br/>\nI was asking her about the night before and she was giving single word <br/>\nanswers, and when I asked if she was going to the park soon, she started crying and <br/>\nsaid &quot;Dad isn&#39;t going and he won&#39;t take me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBrett, another homeschooled teen who&#39;s also in the SCA of late, had just <br/>\narrived to take Kirby, who was still in bed at 11:15.  I had gone to check to see <br/>\nif he wanted to go with Brett but he said no, he really didn&#39;t feel like it.  <br/>\nI reminded him it was his last chance for two more weeks, because he works the <br/>\nnext two Sundays.  He said that&#39;s okay.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Brett had room in his truck.  Kristy&#39;s his second cousin and lives where <br/>\nhe used to live, so it&#39;s not like he had to say &quot;Holly and who?&quot;  He said okay, <br/>\nhe&#39;d take them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly wasn&#39;t having a slothful day, but the rest of us were.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty had a police academy week last week, and was really needing sloth, as <br/>\nwe both woke up promptly at 6:30ish (exactly, I know) and met, up and dressed, <br/>\nin the den at 7:00, each of us having thought &quot;Well at least [Mom/Mart] can <br/>\nsleep late&quot; and then been up fairly late Saturday anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Marty was up by 10:00 or so, playing with some new cards he got at <br/>\nWalmart the day  before  for a game.  (Darn it, this part gets interesting. But the <br/>\ninteresting part is stuff from Saturday, so nevermind for now.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI made a scrambled egg sandwich for Marty and went to ask Keith if he wanted <br/>\none (not because I planned ahead, but because there were leftovers).  He said <br/>\nsure.  I sat with them while they ate. <br/>\n<br/>\nKeith was working on a wooden bench, kinda based on one I bought for $4 at a <br/>\nSt. Vincent de Paul store in 1976 or so.  Wendy had made a copy of it when she <br/>\nfirst started woodworking.  Keith was making a wider put-together/take-apart <br/>\nversion with a cut-out crosspiece, some slide-in dove-tail, some notches here <br/>\nand there.  That&#39;s why he hadn&#39;t wanted to go to fighter practice.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMarty was restless and bored and I asked if he wanted to go to Hollywood <br/>\nVideo and rent something.  But Sundays, the shelves are relativesly bare.  He said <br/>\nthat&#39;s how he discovered the Wild Arms series, though, was &quot;renting some <br/>\nchoad game&quot; and liking it.  So we walked over, out the back gate.  My leg is well <br/>\nenough to walk across the dirt now instead of the longer way down the alley <br/>\nand on the pavement. <br/>\n<br/>\nI looked at DVDs and nothing popped out at me (and later I remembered the <br/>\nthree I had told Kirby I would rent and watch with him, but this IS a tale of a <br/>\nlame day).  Marty got a game and Master of Disguise.  Holly had seen it but <br/>\nnone of the rest of us had.<br/>\n<br/>\nGot back.  Kirby was awake, in a crummy t-shirt and white boxer shorts.  He <br/>\nnever did get further dressed all day.  Except for the walk to Hollywood Video, <br/>\nwhich we can see fully from our back yard, Marty, Kirby and I stayed home all <br/>\nday.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty and Kirby watched Master of Disguise.  I was in the next room (here at <br/>\nthe computer) trying to play Neopets, but the site kept disappearing on me, <br/>\nand so I just worked on adding a couple of things to my webpages.  Put something <br/>\nelse on the main spanking page, and added some links at the bottom of <br/>\ndeschooling, because I wanted to find Pattie Donahue-Krueger&#39;s (having come across it <br/>\nin a pile of old homeschooling publications I found Friday looking for a poem <br/>\nabout Keith that had been published in an SCA newsletter 20 years ago).  Hers <br/>\nisn&#39;t online and I couldn&#39;t find her e-mail address.  (Lame time spent fairly <br/>\nfruitlessly.)<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith met us at the gate when we were on the way back from Hollywood Video.  <br/>\nI said &quot;Marty, didn&#39;t you ask Keith if he had wanted to go with us?&quot;  &quot;No, I <br/>\nforgot.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe wanted me to show him the finished bench.  I sat on it gingerly.  It was <br/>\nworkable, and would have worked better in sand than on concrete, but in no case <br/>\nwas it going to work longer than a couple of hours.  He sat on it with me.  I <br/>\nsaid if we rock back and forth at all, it&#39;s going to break.  He said it might <br/>\nnot.  I said I was afraid of falling, and maybe he could wedge the legs apart <br/>\nwhere it was loose.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe put it upside down on the saw table. I showed him where  I thought wedges <br/>\nand pegs might make it strong enough to last a while (and I was thinking &quot;a <br/>\nday or two instead of an hour or two&quot; but I didn&#39;t say it).  He was still <br/>\nhopeful.  He put in a couple of really thin wedges and it did make it tighter, but <br/>\nthe design was still unstable.  He hit a wedge in with his hand and broke off a <br/>\nlittle piece of wood on the outside of a notch.  At least it was safely on a <br/>\nworkbench when it broke.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI apologized for being the harbinger of technicalities.   I said any two <br/>\nteens in our camp would wiggle while they sat and there was just too much torque <br/>\nand leverage involved for it NOT to break.  But the cross piece was sure purty, <br/>\nand maybe if he glued and pegged the whole thing together it would be a great <br/>\nbench!  &quot;But then it won&#39;t break down to carry,&quot; he said.  &quot;Yeah, but then <br/>\npeople can use it.  Sorry.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith went to the fighter practice park to check on Holly, to see if she <br/>\nwanted to come back earlier than Brett.  She didn&#39;t, so he came back.  (That&#39;s <br/>\nabout five miles another direction than he&#39;d gone that morning.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI offered to go to the store to buy and make something for dinner.  I asked <br/>\nthe boys if there was anything I could make in an hour or less that they had <br/>\nnot had for a while.  Neither of them could thing of anything, and were happy to <br/>\njust sit and watch that movie.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally was not feeling well, and spent much of the afternoon on <br/>\nwhichever toilet was nearest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went to tell Keith I had no dinner plan and didn&#39;t really want one.  He <br/>\nasked if we had macaroni or egg noodles.  I said both.  So he decided he would <br/>\nmake up a pot of beef, onion, noodles and sauce so he could take some for lunch <br/>\nthis week, and I offered to help but he was feeling energetic (and doesn&#39;t <br/>\nlike to share the kitchen) so that was fine.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTurned out we didn&#39;t have enough of either noodles or macaroni to satisfy his <br/>\nplan, but he made do.  He chopped up pre-made frozen meatballs for the meat <br/>\ninstead of messing with onions and raw beef.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrett called to ask if Holly could go to Denny&#39;s with another mom and her two <br/>\nkids.  I don&#39;t trust that mom and I don&#39;t like her two kids, but I wasn&#39;t <br/>\ngoing.  &quot;Is Govanen going?&quot; I asked (the woman&#39;s boyfriend, who is trustworthy <br/>\nand intelligent outside his inexplicable involvement with the girlfriend), and <br/>\nassured Govanen would be there, I said yes.  I&#39;ve known him for ten years.  His <br/>\nparents were Santa Fe buddhist hippes.  He lived in a TP in Guatemala or some <br/>\nsuch part of the time he was little, and his dad ended up being prominent in <br/>\npermanent-building Santa Fe Buddhism eventually.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo Holly and Kristy weren&#39;t home for another hour and a half.  Holly had a <br/>\nVERY busy day. The rest of us kinda grubbed around in what we slept in.  When <br/>\nthe movie ended, Marty and Kirby went up to Kirby&#39;s room, where Marty played the <br/>\nnewly rented lame game (and liked it) while Kirby painted miniatures.    <br/>\nLater Marty got online on my computer while Kirby played the video game.<br/>\n<br/>\nNobody learned anything flashy and new, that I know of.  While looking for <br/>\nPattie&#39;s address, I ran across something (old) from Monica Molinar in Alaska and <br/>\nthought maybe I could find her online.  She was on the old AOL boards and <br/>\nused to send out &quot;the unschooling barrage&quot; because it was the days before easy <br/>\nwebpages, and when people wondered, we sent a batch of e-mails.  She was easy to <br/>\nfind because she&#39;s a realtor in North Pole, and doing church music.  Two <br/>\nwebpages.  She responded within about five minutes of me e-mailing her.  They&#39;re <br/>\nstill homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith and Marty went to sleep fairly early.  Holly asked me to make some food <br/>\nfor her while she was in the shower.   On the way out to get something out of <br/>\nthe garage for Holly&#39;s dinner, I was thinking &quot;How nice, it&#39;s just our <br/>\nfamily, none missing and no extras.&quot; Then I saw Brett&#39;s truck out front.<br/>\n<br/>\nTurns out Brett was asleep on Kirby&#39;s bed.  He didn&#39;t really know he was.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI fed Holly a chicken/rice Lean Cuisine thing, and a bowl of macaroni <br/>\n(Keith&#39;s extra, unspiced) with melted colby cheese on it, and sat with her while she <br/>\nate almost all of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went to check on the plan about Brett getting to work at 8:00 a.m. in a <br/>\ntown 40 miles away, and  ended up watching an episode of Third Rock from the Sun <br/>\nin his room while he was running five different instant message conversations <br/>\non his computer.   Then I helped Holly straighten up her room and tucked her <br/>\nin, and I went to bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to write any more lame days.  We have them. And honestly, <br/>\nthey&#39;re some of my favorite days.  I&#39;ve always had a pretty exciting life and those <br/>\ndays when the answer to &quot;what&#39;d you do today?&quot; is &quot;nothing&quot; are some of the <br/>\nBEST days.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":132859234,"authorName":"Paula Sjogerman","from":"Paula Sjogerman &lt;sjogy@...&gt;","profile":"psjogy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: unschooling","postDate":"1055170884","msgId":14968,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJCMEEwQjc0LjIzNjIlc2pvZ3lAc2JjZ2xvYmFsLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTMtRjM5OTNHaEFVVGZvbW8wMDAzZmViYkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":14967,"nextInTopic":14969,"prevInTime":14967,"nextInTime":14969,"topicId":3026,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ha!

Partially<br/>\nbecause it&#39;s been so long, and also because I am in need of some<br/>\nassistance.  I have been lurking on this list and the unschooling list<br/>\nfor months.  I am the mom of 3 wonderful kids: Stanzi, who is 5, Robby,<br/>\nwho is 3, and Gabbi who is 1.  As a family we have often discovered that<br/>\nthere are names for the things that we do in learning and parenting,<br/>\neven after we&#39;ve been doing them for a while without knowing it.  We<br/>\nwere doing attachment parenting before we realized it had a name.  We<br/>\nalso realized very early on that our parenting style naturally<br/>\ntranslated into a homeschooling environment.  We knew right away that we<br/>\nwould never try to reproduce school at home, but had no idea of the<br/>\nvariety of approaches to homeschooling that exist.  We discovered the<br/>\nconcept of unschooling a couple of years ago and I was able to attend<br/>\nSandra&#39;s workshop at the HSC conference in CA last year.  I had one of<br/>\nthose moments where you know that something is a good fit, and since<br/>\nthen we have never doubted that unschooling was the direction we wanted<br/>\nto take.  These lists have been wonderful at helping me understand<br/>\nunschooling as a lifestyle, rather than just a style of learning.  I<br/>\nhave learned so much about things I had never even thought about before,<br/>\nand I love how these discussions have challenged my parenting in so many<br/>\nways.  My husband and I have grown so much in the past year as we have<br/>\nstarted questioning so much of what we do, and why we do it.<br/>\nSo, that&#39;s the intro.  My question is this: We have belonged to our<br/>\nlocal homeschooling group since its inception a couple of years ago.  It<br/>\nis an inclusive group which was the first of its kind in our very<br/>\nconservative community.  Up until recently we were the only unschooling<br/>\nfamily in our group.  But, recently a few other moms have expressed<br/>\ninterest in unschooling.  So, I thought it would be fun to have a get<br/>\ntogether to discuss where we were at in each of our unschooling<br/>\njourneys, and maybe read a book together.  I posted the idea to our list<br/>\nand I have had such a tremendous response I was a little surprised.  So<br/>\nmy question is, what now?  For the most part these are families that<br/>\nknow almost nothing about unschooling, or they think they do, but seem<br/>\nto have a lot of misconceptions about it :-)  Out of 10 families there<br/>\nmay be one or two that actually come close to really getting it.  One<br/>\nmom even posted that she wanted to bring her husband because she was<br/>\nunschooling her kids, and her husband didn&#39;t understand it. So, she<br/>\nthought bringing him would help so maybe we could explain it to him.<br/>\nMany of the families seem to have the idea that whatever method one<br/>\nuses, whether curriculum or anything else, is considered unschooling as<br/>\nlong as the kids are happy with it.  I would sure appreciate your advice<br/>\non possible formats for a get together of this kind and maybe<br/>\nsuggestions on books we should start with.  Initially, I thought a few<br/>\nof us would read some of Holt&#39;s work together (mostly because I would<br/>\nlike to read some more of that).   However, I am thinking that the<br/>\nUnschooling Handbook might be more appropriate, given the diversity of<br/>\nthe group.

She has some statements that I like<br/>\nand agree with, but then she mixes it up with<br/>\nschool-at-home statements which negate the whole<br/>\npoint.  I feel like using my black marker and red pen<br/>\nto make corrections LOL.

But then...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Some families use unschooling for subjects in which<br/>\ntheir children are strongly motivated and then use<br/>\nmore traditional approaches for other subjects.  Some<br/>\nfamilies practice unschooling during the summer,<br/>\neffectively making for a year-round education.  Other<br/>\nfamilies find that unschooling is the perfect match<br/>\nfor young children, but that older children prefer<br/>\nmore formal educational approaches.  Summer offers a<br/>\ngood time to experiment with self-directed<br/>\nlearning...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has 4 moms who describe in a paragraph or two how<br/>\nunschooling works.  Some of it is good, but then they<br/>\nsay things like &quot;...many of us put a lot of effort<br/>\ninto making opportunities available for our children,<br/>\nand even REQUIRE them to study something they wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nchoose for themselves, from time to time.&quot;  (I added<br/>\nthe capitalization)<br/>\n<br/>\nor this &quot;The girls ran out of ideas of things to learn<br/>\nabout, so it seemed best to implement some REQUIRED<br/>\nreading.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n(I added the capitalization)<br/>\n<br/>\nanyway, after hanging around this list, I feel as if I<br/>\nKNOW what unschooling is and is not, and this book IS<br/>\nNOT.<br/>\n<br/>\nheather m<br/>\n...tucson <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

I took <br/>\nall the higher math and science classes in high school: algebra I & II, <br/>\ngeometry, calculus, trig, biology, chemistry I & II, physics (what FUN! ---I <br/>\nloved that!), and I SUFFERED through every one (except physics). I took 5 <br/>\n(COUNT THEM, FIVE) years of Latin (although I truly loved that) as well as 2 <br/>\nof Spanish (way too easy). <br/>\n<br/>\nCollege was the same way---all those science courses. My whole life revolved <br/>\naround<br/>\npre-vet. Now keep in mind that my LOVE was English and other languages, but I <br/>\nwanted to be a vet. I was GOING to be a vet.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy my junior year, I realized that I really HATED all those science courses <br/>\nand that I would be looking at ugly, sick dogs (owned by people who really <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to pay) all day long. NOT a way to spend the rest of my life. At <br/>\nthe same time, I was gobbling up all those language courses and spent my <br/>\njunior year in Germany and Austria soaking up another language and its <br/>\nculture. HEAVEN!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what have I done? (without that precious degree, BTW----I dropped out!) <br/>\nOpened and managed a provencial French restaurant, ridden race horses, owned <br/>\na tack shop, owned four successful dog grooming shops, and now I&#39;m a MEAN <br/>\ngardener, a dog show judge, and a coordinator for an unschooling conference <br/>\nin October!&lt;g&gt;.  Not bragging, just saying that I did these things AS I got <br/>\ninterested in them. I would never have thought I&#39;d ever garden (BORING!) or <br/>\nhost a conference as a teenager. I will NEVER have another retail business or <br/>\nride racehorses again! I&#39;m moving on, changing. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m SOOO glad I&#39;m not a vet. Two of my very good friends are. It&#39;s a rough <br/>\nlife. Not for me. I don&#39;t think I &quot;failed&quot; by not becoming a vet. I <br/>\n&quot;succeeded&quot; in the things I was interested in AT THE TIME. I&#39;ll let you know <br/>\nwhat I&#39;m doing in 5 years---probably something completely different!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s so much time to experiment, quit, and try something else. Don&#39;t gear <br/>\nEVERYTHING towards being a vet (or anything else). Life&#39;s a journey.

And I think that most informed people agree more or less on<br/>\nthe definition of unschooling.  However, I also think that people differ<br/>\nwidely on the details of unschooling.  For example, can you suggest<br/>\ncourses of study, books, or activities?  Leave interesting material<br/>\nlying around?  Insist that children finish a project or class they&#39;ve<br/>\nchosen and already started?  Allow children to take classes in the first<br/>\nplace?

A good analogy<br/>\n&gt; is if someone claimed to be a vegetarian but they ate meat on weekends or<br/>\n&gt; when they weren&#39;t home.  The above person certainly has vegetarian tendencies<br/>\n&gt; but IMO they aren&#39;t a vegetarian.  I have read/heard similar things from<br/>\n&gt; supposed unschooling parents in the past. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Obviously, I was not privy to the discussions in question.  I do think<br/>\nit&#39;s important to explain unschooling to people and help them see that<br/>\nit is a viable option.  I agree that it would have been a disservice to<br/>\nsimply say &#39;whatever works for you&#39; in this context.
