You might want to read it first and make sure <br/>\nit fits.  That would be cool if it does, but if you change your mind <br/>\nafter reading it I won&#39;t be offended.  The topic on the board <br/>\nwas &quot;help me get a list of minimum daily goals ( as an unschool <br/>\nleaning mom)&quot;  I said:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re radical unschoolers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy minimum daily goal is to talk about everything that is going on <br/>\naround us and pursue anything dd finds interesting.  I also try to go <br/>\nsomewhere new every week.  The week before last we went to the zoo.  <br/>\nLast week we went out to the forest for the day, hiked, started a <br/>\nlittle fire, saw the wildlife.  I haven&#39;t made plans for this week <br/>\nyet.  Some future ideas are the children&#39;s museum, the beach, the <br/>\nwildlife refuge.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some things we&#39;ve talked about/done in the last 2 or 3 <br/>\ndays:  <br/>\n<br/>\nDd dictated a letter for me to write to her cousin and drew her a <br/>\npicture.  We put that in the mail and talked about post offices, what <br/>\nthey do, where the mail goes.  We went to the bank and talked about <br/>\ndepositing money.  We went to the creek behind our house and saw <br/>\nducks.  We talked about where they live, what they eat, which ones <br/>\nare male and female.  She found some red berries and we talked about <br/>\nthose.  I meant to bring some inside and find out what they were.  <br/>\nI&#39;ll have to do that next time.  We talked about how some berries are <br/>\ngood to eat and some are poisonous and that I didn&#39;t know which those <br/>\nwere.  We talked about how the drier works and electricity.  We <br/>\nwatched Zathura and talked about robots and cryogenics.  She <br/>\npretended to make crabby patties at her own restaurant, and we bought <br/>\nsome from her and talked about money.  We took a walk in the dark to <br/>\nlook at the stars, but the stars weren&#39;t out so we ended up talking <br/>\nabout clouds and fog and what those are made of and where the sun <br/>\ngoes when it gets dark.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe went to the library and got books on horses and Aesopes Fables.  <br/>\nWe talked about the different parts of a horse&#39;s body and different <br/>\nbreeds.  Aesopes Fables led to discussions about turtles and eagles.  <br/>\nWe talked about the Davidic dance at our church and worshipping God.  <br/>\nWe soaked some nuts and talked about how that makes them easier to <br/>\ndigest and what digestion is.  She brought me her Bible and wanted me <br/>\nto tell her all the letters on the front.  So, I told her the letters <br/>\nand that it said The Toddlers Bible and then she said it after me and <br/>\nsaid &quot;I read it!&quot;  She did the same thing with half of the Green Eggs <br/>\nand Ham book.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe played on starfall.com and did puzzles, letters and stories.  She <br/>\ncounted while we threw a football back and forth.  She asked me to <br/>\nread a Tiger counting book and she wanted to point at each of the <br/>\nnumbers as I said it.  She is really looking forward to her birthday <br/>\nso we looked at a calendar and talked about today&#39;s date and the day <br/>\nof her birthday and the day of her party.  We planned her party.  She <br/>\nwatched Survivor Man with dh and they talked about making fire and <br/>\nfishing.  She watched a show about bears with him and they talked <br/>\nabout the bears.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe went for a hike and talked about the plants we saw.  We made a <br/>\nfire and talked about flint and steel, and watched dh struggle with <br/>\nit instead of just using his lighter.   She watched dh and I shoot <br/>\nour gun, and we talked about what guns are for.  We got out my <br/>\nUsborne books and talked about the moon and astronaunts and zoo <br/>\nanimals and moving and moving trucks.        <br/>\n<br/>\nWe haven&#39;t done much youtube.com in the last few days, but we often <br/>\nto there to look at anything she&#39;s interested in.  Horses, belly <br/>\ndancing, the nutcracker ballet, frogs, bears, monkeys, dogs, cats.... <br/>\nlet&#39;s just say animals!  Also, motorcycles, trains and all kinds of <br/>\nother things.   In the last few weeks we did paper mache and I got a <br/>\nlibrary book on it a few days ago, so we&#39;re going to do that again.  <br/>\nWe made our own dominoes by printing them off the computer and taping <br/>\nthe paper to cardboard.  We play with cards, and poker chips.  We <br/>\nread a lot.  She draws a lot.  For her birthday I&#39;m getting her <br/>\npuzzles, art supplies, and chalk.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think of any of this as &quot;school&quot; stuff.  We just live life <br/>\nand talk about everything going on.  I try to make life fun and <br/>\ninteresting and sparkly.  That&#39;s my minumum daily goal.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nforce anything.  I only make suggestions- not based on some arbitrary <br/>\nsubject I think she should be learning- but based on what she is <br/>\ninterested in or what I think she might like to do or see or what <br/>\nsounds fun.  And learning happens!   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-Someone on a message board I&#39;m on was talking about unschooling <br/>\nand I<br/>\n&gt; ended up writing a book about what our unschooling days look like.<br/>\n&gt; Then I copied it and sent it to my mom.-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Do you want me to add it to the typical days collection here?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/typical\">http://sandradodd.com/typical</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] I wonder how life would have been different....","postDate":"1227568628","msgId":40442,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYyN0M4MTVDLThFQUEtNDkxRC1BNDQzLTQ2RjAyQzNBQjREQ0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdnZGowcisxOHFjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdnZGowcisxOHFjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40435,"nextInTopic":40457,"prevInTime":40441,"nextInTime":40443,"topicId":40416,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Someone on a message board I m on was talking about unschooling and I ended up writing a book about what our unschooling days look like.
