When you choose things in a restricted<br/>\nselection made by someone else, you&#39;re not picking on your own. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren being and doing things &quot;on their own&quot; isn&#39;t an unschooling goal.<br/>\nIt&#39;s more like a life skill that will come with maturity (for most people -<br/>\ncertain medical conditions excepted).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter had wanted to do things on her own, meaning without my help, in<br/>\npiece meal manner. It hasn&#39;t been a linear thing either - she will return to<br/>\nwanting help after appearing to master something. For example, for a long<br/>\ntime she would ask me to do the difficult parts of her computer games, that<br/>\nshe can now do for herself. However she will still ask me to do what she<br/>\nconsiders to be the boring parts.Then in her personal needs she has long<br/>\nmoved from needing a lot of physical help, to only asking me to help her<br/>\nrarely. This is natural.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that Guillaume is talking about something more mental - the idea<br/>\nof making choices freely. But again there is a difference, one of the most<br/>\nwiggly concepts to work into, between a child being free to make their own<br/>\nchoices, and a child being left to make their own choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of times there has been a kind of impatience expressed for the<br/>\nchild to learn to read, as if that will be the magic talisman that will<br/>\nrelease the parents from responsibility for helping or supporting the choice<br/>\nmaking process. I think it&#39;s a problematic idea, and perhaps not what<br/>\nGuillame intended to express.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is possible to offer your child choices based on visual cues. When I took<br/>\ninfant/toddler Jayn clothes shopping I would hold up two garments and buy<br/>\nthe one she reached for. Soon we could peruse the DVD aisles and she would<br/>\nlook at pictures of fun characters. It&#39;s about being out in the world and<br/>\nwatching and listening.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren read at different times, unrelated to parental desire. Impatience,<br/>\neven well intentioned impatience, won&#39;t speed and may hinder the process.<br/>\nAlso just because a child can read, does not mean that parents shouldn&#39;t<br/>\nstill read to them and with them and be intimately involved in the choices.<br/>\nMy daughter wants me to advise her - on her own terms by which I mean when<br/>\nshe asks me for advice. I would say that as she matures she is asking for my<br/>\nopinion more often and with more willingness to hear it, rather than less.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe range of new offerings need not be done in a vacuum. Guillame seems<br/>\nlaudably concerned that he is limiting his children&#39;s choices to his own<br/>\ninterests, but seems equally worried because apparently because they like<br/>\nwhat he has offered them! That is the place to start with the next offering<br/>\n- games that are similar, other ways into the same world.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example - starting with Star Wars Battleground - other games that are<br/>\nsimilar in a variety of ways, other sci-fi games, other battle games; the<br/>\nStar Wars movies; Star Wars Clone Wars animated series; picture books about<br/>\nStar Wars and the making of the movies; some of the numerous (really<br/>\nnumerous) novels set in the Star Wars universe; toys and figures - then of<br/>\ncourse the other games might be pathways to other activities too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no predicting the path of a single interest. The way to offer might<br/>\nbe as simple as reading the tv guide and saying, &quot;Oh look what&#39;s on<br/>\ntomorrow&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my point is that time, living in the world, and avoiding the<br/>\ncreation of artificial barriers to such interests as they will express, as<br/>\nyou will observe them expressing, will take care of your fears that their<br/>\nchoices are not real. They will find other influences and other sources of<br/>\ninspiration. The other side of that is, of course there is another side,<br/>\njust because they have plenty of new information coming in from the outside<br/>\nworld, does not then mean that parents are released from actively<br/>\nunschooling, or that the kids are abandoned to make choices &quot;on their own&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Many people have their favorite stores to shop in because the  <br/>\nstore buyers have tastes that match their own. They don&#39;t want to  <br/>\nchoose from 10,000 different styles of pants. They just want a few  <br/>\ndozen.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere this line of discussion got derailed is this from your original  <br/>\npost:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t think my (Strawberry Shortcake / Dora / Disney Princesses)-  <br/>\n&gt; addicted girl would like this kind of show.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But I love that your kids are now doing webcast, and I like the  <br/>\n&gt; idea of suggesting to her something a bit more &quot;realistic&quot;...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, .. I&#39;m not sure what is my question in fact, since you already  <br/>\n&gt; told your daughter loves it. I&#39;m just going to try it :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>First, in English, to help people move toward unschooling, addicted  <br/>\nis a negative word to refer to children&#39;s passions. Yes, I know you  <br/>\nlater said you didn&#39;t mean it negatively. But in posts we only have  <br/>\nwords not the intended meaning. So to be clear in writing and in  <br/>\nthinking, it good to keep in mind the meaning others will generally  <br/>\nread into words.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the words in the first line suggest there are negative feelings  <br/>\nabout your daughter&#39;s choices. (Again, we&#39;re talking about the idea  <br/>\nsuggested by the words. Whether or not the idea is in your home, it&#39;s  <br/>\nnow on the list and in people&#39;s heads. Not about you, but as a  <br/>\nconcept to discuss. *Other* people will have thought &quot;addicted&quot; about  <br/>\ntheir children&#39;s passions in a negative way so it&#39;s a good  <br/>\nopportunity to discuss it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, you like that someone&#39;s children are doing webcasts because  <br/>\nthey watch the show. This kind of thinking -- while natural and  <br/>\ncommon -- will lead someone away from unschooling. It&#39;s the &quot;If I  <br/>\nexpose my child to x, then maybe my child will do the y that I think  <br/>\nis cool.&quot; For unschooling purposes, it&#39;s good to face the child  <br/>\nrather than some direction you&#39;d like them to go. It&#39;s good to focus  <br/>\non the enjoyment and not a direction you think an interest will lead.  <br/>\nIf a parent wants disappointment and frustration and negative  <br/>\nattitudes toward a child, then it&#39;s a good path. ;-) (Not a path that  <br/>\nguarantees that destination, but a path that leads that direction.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect you&#39;d be okay if she never did a webcam after watching the  <br/>\nshow, but to entertain a cool direction an interest could go is not  <br/>\nhealthy for unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a real life example: My daughter loves running and is a  <br/>\nnatural long distance runner. She joined the cross country team as a  <br/>\n&quot;freshman&quot; (in my town homeschoolers can compete on school sports  <br/>\nteams) and immediately made varsity (top 10 runners on the team). My  <br/>\nhusband was on the same team 35 years ago and wanted to help her do  <br/>\nwhat he did. She was enthusiastic at first. It took a year or so for  <br/>\nher to realize she loved running but didn&#39;t like competition. It took  <br/>\nmy husband much longer for him to fully grasp what she was saying. It  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t make sense to him! ;-) He&#39;s not a rabid competitor but he  <br/>\nlikes the personal challenges. It didn&#39;t make sense to him that  <br/>\nsomeone could run well and not care whether they were improving or  <br/>\nnot. And because he was facing the goal instead of her, there was a  <br/>\nlot of strain between them before they both finally figure it out and  <br/>\nhe accepted it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, you&#39;re liking the idea of suggesting something more realistic,  <br/>\nimplying -- again, we only have words not intent -- there&#39;s something  <br/>\nlacking in her current choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s another good idea to pull out and discuss for people trying to  <br/>\nget unschooling. It&#39;s good for unschooling to provide a variety of  <br/>\nchoices and opportunities, even stretching beyond what a child has  <br/>\nshown she likes. We can&#39;t know whether they like dinosaurs if they&#39;ve  <br/>\nnever been exposed to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n*But* if a parent is judging a child&#39;s choices as not as good as  <br/>\nactivities the parent thinks are more worthwhile, that&#39;s a line of  <br/>\nthinking that isn&#39;t good for unschooling. To help a parent stop  <br/>\nunconsciously pressuring a child in the direction the parent wants  <br/>\nthem to go, it would be better for the parent to *first* fully  <br/>\nembrace the child&#39;s passions and help the child explore those in the  <br/>\nway the *child* enjoys before the parent strews other ideas. The  <br/>\nparent needs to let go of the idea of pulling a child away from  <br/>\nsomething and embrace the idea of a range of choices the child enjoys  <br/>\nand being cool with what the child chooses.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, we&#39;re not talking about you. We&#39;re talking about the ideas the  <br/>\nwords have suggested.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do want your ideas discussed, being as clear as you can be in  <br/>\nyour wording helps. But once the discussion of an idea begins, that  <br/>\nidea doesn&#39;t belong to you anymore. It belongs to the list. You can  <br/>\nbring in new ideas that are closer to what might be troubling you,  <br/>\nbut once the ideas reach the list, they&#39;re not yours anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193946716,"authorName":"Guillaume JAY","from":"Guillaume JAY &lt;gjay@...&gt;","profile":"gaegui","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: iCarly ?

I&#39;m not sure) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(maybe it&#39;s also because I&#39;m a man, and finding stuff my boy would like is easy, whereas I believe (maybe i&#39;m wrong) that it&#39;s much harder with my daughter) <br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, I don&#39;t understand why she did not like Hilltop Hospital, which is quite cute, and which is about sick animals... <br/>\n<br/>\nAs already said, she likes Futuruma. Is it cute ? Is is geared towards 4yo girl ? I don&#39;t think so. Why then ?

I just don&#39;t think I should offer only things they like -now- (more exactly : things based on what -I- believe they like and dislike), because I can be wrong.

She&#39;ll decide if she likes it or not, and at worst she would have lost 10 minutes of her life..***<br/>\n<br/>\n***But how can you be sure that your (hypothetical romantic-lover) kid would not love too the sci-fi thing ? ***<br/>\n<br/>\nI never said it was a problem.  Without going back and rereading, I think I asked why you would do that.  When I read what you wrote, and it could be misinterpreted because of french to english translation, it sounded like you were wanting to steer her away from something.<br/>\n<br/>\nIntroducing kids to new things is great.  It&#39;s really good to know WHY your kids like certain things, so that you can add to it.  If what your daughter likes about shows is the girl friendship aspect, iCarly might just work great.  I can think of some little girls that I&#39;ve known that were super into really cutesy girly things, that wouldn&#39;t have appreciated iCarly or various other shows similar because they really really liked the cutesy girly things better, and while they wouldn&#39;t have hated or completely dismissed the other shows, they just wouldn&#39;t have been into them at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with the hypothetical romance lover potentially liking sci-fi, that kid could find that she likes sci-fi.  However, if I&#39;m wanting to steer her away from romance movies to get her interested in sci-fi, that might not go over so well.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s more about motive and intent.  Since you had used the word &quot;addicted&quot;, it seemed like perhaps you wanted to offer things that weren&#39;t so addicting.  Again that could be a language usage difference here.  Generally, addictions aren&#39;t considered healthy or good.<br/>\n<br/>\n***She told me it&#39;s the drawing style. (she has no problem with watching &quot;western&quot; animated movies with kids, on the contrary)***<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some good &quot;western&quot; animated movies and shows for sure.  There are some anime things that I don&#39;t really care for.  It really depends on the art, the story, and the music.  I have a friend who&#39;s family loves anime and she can take it or leave it, but she does really really like a show called Hell Girl.  She loves the art and story in that particular show.  What has really appealed to me, as an artist, is the way backgrounds are put into anime, and the details in clothing and surroundings and the way the scenes mesh together.  It is one reason Hayao Miyazaki stands out, his work is brilliant in that regard!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest daughter, the anime lover, is really particular about anime art.  She pays attention to how the facial features are done and how an artist has portrayed hair and clothing, and even more importantly how blood is portrayed, or not.   There have been very few &quot;western&quot; animated things that have that level of detail that she loves.  The Nightmare Before Christmas, is one.  Shrek is another.  When she was younger, her 2 favorites were the Lion King and Aladdin, both, really detailed and dramatic.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: iCarly ?

That&#39;s what I&#39;ve done with my kids, add to what they like already and keep adding and keep adding, and soon they add things themselves and it just naturally flows from one thing to the next thing.  It really depends on WHY a child likes a certain thing.

What I find really enjoyable about much of anime, whether or not the story or actual animation is thrilling for me, the plot lines and behind the scenes part of it is soooo detailed and that would be true for all anime.  The characters are created with history already existing and so, it can play a part in the story.

I&#39;ve watched hundreds of hours of Pokemon, Inuyasha, and Naruto, as well as Bleach, Death Note, and Full Metal Alchemist, and plenty of other ones, the bloodier the better in my older daughter&#39;s view.  When it all started with Pokemon, I had no idea that I&#39;d log that many hours into anime.

It&#39;s a bit like &quot;hating books&quot;.<br/>\nThere are all kinds of different stories and styles of anime. Jayn used to<br/>\nadore Sailor Moon. There are talking cats in SM.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, anime is so very likely to have stories and character that will<br/>\nfascinate a child, that the hate and distrust of it emanating from a loved<br/>\nadult could become a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe generally advise people to watch with their kids, and try to find what it<br/>\nis that their kids like about the tv or game or activity as a path to<br/>\nfinding something to like about it themselves. However if a parent is so<br/>\nfull of negativity, as in &quot;hate&quot;, then I think it&#39;s worth that parent<br/>\nstaying right away until they can find a way to be at least tolerant, rather<br/>\nthan destroy their child&#39;s enjoyment and, more importantly, their child&#39;s<br/>\ntrust in the parent&#39;s judgement. Meanwhile it&#39;s great that there is one<br/>\nparent who does share the enjoyment.<br/>\nWhen Jayn is watching something I don&#39;t enjoy - usually because I have seen<br/>\nit 25 times already - I find something else to do, sometimes with my<br/>\nearplugs in. She will call me to watch those little special moments of humor<br/>\nthat have become some of our family in jokes. Dh has different moments,<br/>\ndifferent interests. I don&#39;t think we have the expectation that he will<br/>\nwatch all the same things, do all the same games, with Jayn as I do. That&#39;s<br/>\none reason why it&#39;s great to have two parents around - or more than one<br/>\ntrusted adult around.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have never been in a situation where I have &quot;hated&quot; something Jayn loves.<br/>\nSighed with boredom, not liked much, a minor amount of discomfort - but<br/>\nnever the kind of emotional investment of &quot;hate&quot;. Jayn has never challenged<br/>\nme with a passion for something that opposes my core belief system though. I<br/>\nhope if she ever does I will find my way to applying unschooling principles<br/>\nto the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

But I&#39;m not very good at finding stuff for her. As for &quot;meaningful ways&quot;, I don&#39;t know what you mean. Presently, my way is &quot;I think she&#39;s going to like that, so just show her&quot;... <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But why, if you don&#39;t know that your daughter will like it.It&#39;s on tv pretty regularly, if she comes across it and loves it then go for it.

But that&#39;s because of 1 (above), not because she does not like &quot;live action&quot; (in fact, I don&#39;t know if she likes it or not, I&#39;ve never shown her) <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, I don&#39;t understand your point. I heard about a show an girl the same age just likes, and I should not show it to her because she did not find it by herself ? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If your daughter really likes shows with strong female characters and you&#39;d like to expand THAT idea, I&#39;d suggest Hayao Miyazaki movies.

We already watched The cat returns (not by Miyazaki), and she loved it (but it&#39;s with cats, which she just loves). It&#39;s just a matter of opportunity, but since my wife hates anime (without really knowing what is it), it must come from me (also, I&#39;d like to discover it with her - never watched any myself). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGuillaume <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":311075098,"authorName":"Mandy Ray-Jones","from":"Mandy Ray-Jones &lt;shebrakes4rainbows@...&gt;","profile":"shebrakes4rainbows","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: iCarly ?
