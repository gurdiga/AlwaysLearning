She might not forever, <br/>\nbut it&#39;s better to analyze how to NOT struggle now, than to wait.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecognizing that the children shouldn&#39;t be held responsible to a deal regarding <br/>\nthe care of a pregnant mother and newborn, will go a long way in helping a mom <br/>\nin that situation who seems frustrated and looking to blame.  Blaming can be so <br/>\nsubtle and people do it without even realizing they are doing it.  Taking away <br/>\nblame can take away the shame that comes with it, the expectations of not <br/>\nmeeting someone else&#39;s agenda, and being truly able to openly help out without <br/>\nfeeling as if you are giving in to the demands of others so as not to be blamed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe blame/shame dynamic is huge and powerful and is in full operation in sooooo <br/>\nmany families.  To me, when I read the original post, I read that part loud and <br/>\nclear whether the poster intended that to come across or not.  I chose NOT to <br/>\naddress it but am doing so now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe quoted post above is intended to blame and shame.  I hope that person <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t do that to her own children.  I&#39;ve found that people who do that, do it <br/>\nto everyone and are often not aware that they are even doing it.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>\ncreate open healthy happy relationships where happy learning can flourish.  It&#39;s <br/>\nnot solution oriented.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlaming others can sometimes make the blamer feel as if they&#39;ve done their part <br/>\nand others are responsible now, so that they can *feel* right in their feelings <br/>\nof how out of control they are.  Once you can pass the blame onto someone else, <br/>\nit&#39;s not your job anymore to fix it, but if it doesn&#39;t get fixed, then what? <br/>\n You&#39;re still left with a messy house, nothing has changed at all, except that <br/>\n now, everyone feels bad.  If a mom can let go of blame, even blaming <br/>\nthemselves, they can move forward toward a workable goal.  It becomes solution <br/>\noriented if you can focus on what you want to get done rather than who isn&#39;t <br/>\ndoing it.  It&#39;s a simple process, but one that a person must be aware of to <br/>\nchange.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Unschooling from bed","postDate":"1292616978","msgId":58504,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgyOEZEQjM4LTdGNzEtNDRDNS05ODNDLTdFMkZBRjZGOUNCMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDdBNjdCNTAwLTNCRUYtNDU4My05RkUxLUM5OUU1NDkzQTkxRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGllYjZ0aitmYXU5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8OENENkFCQzZCRkIxMjQ4LTFBMjQtNDc1MkB3ZWJtYWlsLWQwOTIuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+IDw3QTY3QjUwMC0zQkVGLTQ1ODMtOUZFMS1DOTlFNTQ5M0E5MUZAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":58502,"nextInTopic":58505,"prevInTime":58503,"nextInTime":58505,"topicId":58476,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-This woman was asking for help.

I need some solutions for how to manage my home and some semblance of <br/>\npeace while unable to get out of bed.  I&#39;m currently about 9 weeks pregnant with <br/>\nmy fourth child and very, very sick. I have a 13 yo daughter, 10 yo son, and 7 <br/>\nyo old daughter and we&#39;ve been unschooling about a year and a half.  I was also <br/>\nvery sick with my girls but not quite as bad with my son so we knew we could <br/>\nexpect this when we decided to have another baby. Right now I&#39;m extremely <br/>\nnauseous 24/7. It&#39;s rare for me to be able to even sit up in bed. Sometimes just <br/>\nchanging positions makes me throw up. I&#39;m basically only getting up to use the <br/>\nbathroom. I know from my previous pregnancies that it&#39;s not going to change much <br/>\nfor the next several months.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, the kids were the ones who begged us to consider having another <br/>\nbaby. They even did all the housework for a few days to &quot;prove&quot; to us that it <br/>\nwould be ok for me to be sick. However, now that I am that&#39;s all changed. They <br/>\nnever even attempted to help out from the begining. The house is continually <br/>\ntrashed - think 3 kids who leave out every dish they use, leave their clothes <br/>\nwherever they take them off, put absolutely nothing away that they use or play <br/>\nwith and you get the idea. My poor husband comes home from a long day at work <br/>\nand that&#39;s what he walks into. It&#39;s definitely not contributing to a peaceful <br/>\nhome environment. I&#39;ve been much more lenient with them the past year, cleaning <br/>\nup for them, not forcing them to do chores and my husband feels that I&#39;ve turned <br/>\nthem into irresponsible slobs who can&#39;t clean up after themselves. I&#39;m afraid <br/>\nthe evidence speaks for itself. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know this is hard for them and even though they are older I&#39;m sure it&#39;s still <br/>\noverwhelming. Even though we talked a lot about what it would be like ahead of <br/>\ntime, I know the reality is harder than they expected. I don&#39;t want to be too <br/>\nhard on them but I  can&#39;t ignore the reality of the situation either. It&#39;s <br/>\nreally not fair for my husband to work all day and then come home to clean up <br/>\nafter a 13, 10 and 7 yo who sat watching tv and playing on the computer all day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really at a loss as to what to do.

It is a necessity, right now, that <br/>\nthey help out or, atleast, clean up after themselves because I&#39;m not available <br/>\nto do it. I don&#39;t want to go back to lists, charts, rewards, punishments and <br/>\nangry power struggles though either.<br/>\nIf anyone has any suggestions for maintaining some balance, order and peace in a <br/>\nway that&#39;s fair to everybody I would greatly appreciate it. ***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem you are facing is BECAUSE you had lists, charts, rewards, <br/>\npunishments, and angry power struggles.  The kids will continue what they are <br/>\ndoing because they are waiting for you to step in and tell them what to do with <br/>\nlists and charts and rewards and power struggles.  That is how you&#39;ve trained <br/>\nthem thus far to view household maintenance.  Until they see the value for <br/>\nthemselves, in doing these things, they probably won&#39;t do them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are things that you and your husband can do to help.  One of my favorite <br/>\nways to do a household cleanup when I&#39;m overwhelmed, is the 10 min pickup. <br/>\n That&#39;s and easy one for the whole family and can be done just before your <br/>\nhusband gets home.  If he can come home and not feel overwhelmed, it&#39;s much more <br/>\nlikely he will be able to pick up the rest of the household maintenance.  A 10 <br/>\nmin pickup is basically doing as much as a person can for that allotted time and <br/>\nthen stopping.  It might even be a small enough time for you to help too without <br/>\nfeeling terribly sick.  It&#39;s enough time for one person to gather all dishes, <br/>\nanother to pick up coats and shoes, and another to take out garbage.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would highly suggest hiring someone to come and help out.  It doesn&#39;t need to <br/>\nbe a do everything someone, just maybe someone to do the dishes or vacuum or <br/>\nclean the toilet.  Hire a teenager that lives nearby, someone who can come over <br/>\nevery couple of days for an hour or two.  It might be worth it monetarily, to <br/>\nend power struggles and the general pattern towards household maintenance.  It&#39;s <br/>\na valuable skill that people get paid to do, unless you do it yourself and keep <br/>\nyour pocket money.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe evidence that you are seeing from your children is the main reason that I <br/>\nhaven&#39;t done that.  I want my kids to help out because they WANT to help out and <br/>\nsee a need for it.  I have a 16 yr old that will do the dishes willingly simply <br/>\nbecause she wants to hang out in the kitchen with me and sees a need for dishes <br/>\nto be clean.  It really is that simple, but in order to get that outcome you <br/>\nmust make it all part of the joys of living, not chores that must be done.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":435001304,"authorName":"debbiernoll","from":"&quot;debbiernoll&quot; &lt;debbiernoll@...&gt;","profile":"debbiernoll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Unschooling from bed","postDate":"1292443379","msgId":58476,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGllYjZ0aitmYXU5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":58477,"prevInTime":58475,"nextInTime":58477,"topicId":58476,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Help!

I need some solutions for how to manage my home and some semblance of peace while unable to get out of bed.  I&#39;m currently about 9 weeks pregnant with my fourth child and very, very sick. I have a 13 yo daughter, 10 yo son, and 7 yo old daughter and we&#39;ve been unschooling about a year and a half.  I was also very sick with my girls but not quite as bad with my son so we knew we could expect this when we decided to have another baby. Right now I&#39;m extremely nauseous 24/7. It&#39;s rare for me to be able to even sit up in bed. Sometimes just changing positions makes me throw up. I&#39;m basically only getting up to use the bathroom. I know from my previous pregnancies that it&#39;s not going to change much for the next several months.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, the kids were the ones who begged us to consider having another baby. They even did all the housework for a few days to &quot;prove&quot; to us that it would be ok for me to be sick. However, now that I am that&#39;s all changed. They never even attempted to help out from the begining. The house is continually trashed - think 3 kids who leave out every dish they use, leave their clothes wherever they take them off, put absolutely nothing away that they use or play with and you get the idea. My poor husband comes home from a long day at work and that&#39;s what he walks into. It&#39;s definitely not contributing to a peaceful home environment. I&#39;ve been much more lenient with them the past year, cleaning up for them, not forcing them to do chores and my husband feels that I&#39;ve turned them into irresponsible slobs who can&#39;t clean up after themselves. I&#39;m afraid the evidence speaks for itself. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know this is hard for them and even though they are older I&#39;m sure it&#39;s still overwhelming. Even though we talked a lot about what it would be like ahead of time, I know the reality is harder than they expected. I don&#39;t want to be too hard on them but I  can&#39;t ignore the reality of the situation either. It&#39;s really not fair for my husband to work all day and then come home to clean up after a 13, 10 and 7 yo who sat watching tv and playing on the computer all day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really at a loss as to what to do. It is a necessity, right now, that they help out or, atleast, clean up after themselves because I&#39;m not available to do it. I don&#39;t want to go back to lists, charts, rewards, punishments and angry power struggles though either.<br/>\nIf anyone has any suggestions for maintaining some balance, order and peace in a way that&#39;s fair to everybody I would greatly appreciate it.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58508,"nextTopicId":58529}}
