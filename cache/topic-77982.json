One thing I found surprising and upsetting when each of my children were babies:  Sometimes I would go out by myself to the grocery store for a bit while the baby stayed with daddy.  On several different grocery trips, I would be shopping, and a random baby in the store would start crying and keep crying and crying, usually left in the carseat perched on the cart. The parent might jiggle it or shush a bit, but not pick up the baby, or maybe just completely ignore and keep shopping.  This could be in the next aisle or two over.  It was so sad!! I couldn&#39;t stand it!  Neither could my body! My milk would let down and leak out just at the sound of it.  I haven&#39;t had nurslings for years, but still can&#39;t stand to be around while people don&#39;t pick up their crying babies. Now it&#39;s just my heart and my adrenaline that reacts, not my breastmilk.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to Sandra:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister, Irene, was working in a grocery store when she was nursing her second child.  She sid when someone entered with an infant she 1) hoped the baby wouldn’t cry, and 2) hoped they would go through another line.  Just even being near a baby could make her milk let down, and it would be tight, and hurt, or leak, or flow.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat’s biology.  Is it instinct?  It bypasses decision making.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomewhere, biology and instinct must overlap.  Like fear of snakes, or of heights.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":469232503,"authorName":"dh.family@frontier.com","from":"&quot;dh.family@...&quot;

It’s not evil.  It wouldn’t be good to throw ALL of that out to “follow instincts.”  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome people go too far with “I follow my instincts” the same way people can go too far with just about any excuse to do whatever they want to regardless of the needs or feelings of others.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI DO think there are more instincts than even experts like to acknowledge.  Denying it altogether is wrong.<br/>\nJumping the social ship to live by instinct alone is just as wrong.  Either humans are special (and not animals) and we’re meant to live by whatever traditions of government and religion “God has given us” (because lots of cultlures blame/credit God for their situations and traditions), or we’re primates, and primates also have a sort of government (hierarchy and behavioral expectations).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf one wants to get all philosophical (or more philosophical), it’s books and laws that allow people to depart from their own culture.  “Freedom of religion” makes it legal for a child to choose a religion other than the one his parents grrew up in.  Belief systems (political, economic, behavioral, dietary) give people justifications for “switching religions” there, too.  Someone who wants to parent a different way than her mother did can wave a Dr. Sears or Penelope Leach book and say “This has research behind it,” and the parents aren’t likely to have read other more modern authors to refute it.  Traditions involving “book-learning” make books more powerful than they should be. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt’s complicated.  It’s confusing.  It’s hard to prove, and probably not worth trying to prove.<br/>\nIt IS worth thinking about sometimes, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":262895925,"authorName":"Sam","from":"Sam &lt;rainmountain1@...&gt;","profile":"rainmountain1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Instinct","postDate":"1495094293","msgId":78012,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMzMzFCQjUyLTlEQjctNDVCQy1BNjU2LUYwRDJBMkI2RUU3RkB5YWhvby5jby51az4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDY0NEQzNzkxLUVGNjItNDcwNy04QzZELTI5RDBGNTVEMDI0MEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDEwNUZFREUwLTczNDMtNEYwMi05QkVCLTcxMDY5Qjg5RURBQUBnbWFpbC5jb20+IDwwODJBOTJBMi04MkExLTQ5ODYtQTE5Ny03MDdGRDFFODcyMzFAc2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDw4RTI2MUM4Ni01NDQxLTQ2QzEtQTQzRC0yOERDRUREM0E4NTBAc2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDw2NDREMzc5MS1FRjYyLTQ3MDctOEM2RC0yOUQwRjU1RDAyNDBAc2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":78010,"nextInTopic":78013,"prevInTime":78011,"nextInTime":78013,"topicId":77982,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Wow that was so powerful and beautifully written.

It’s quite poetic, overall, and I want to save it on my website. <br>\nI think it’s a shame for something this beautiful to be credited only to “anonymous,” but here it is.<br>\n____________________________<br>\n<br>\nMy 7 year old daughter was reading over my shoulder part of the time as I wrote, and it sparked some interesting discussion. <br>\n<br>\nIt got way too long, and I don&#39;t know if it fits anywhere, but you&#39;re welcome to use it, anonymously, please.<br>\n____________________________<br>\n<br>\nIt seems we have lost many of our instincts through lack of use or by overriding them for modern purposes.  <br>\n<br>\nWhen I was pregnant for the first time, I began to feel an intense drive to protect and provide for my baby, and that continued fiercely after he was born.  At night, I could wake up whenever he stirred, let him nurse whenever his body language told me he needed to, and he slept peacefully and safely on my chest or snuggled beside me like a kitten with its mother cat.<br>\n<br>\nWhen he cried, it tore at my heart, and I felt very strongly compelled to comfort him.  It was a strong physical drive, a compulsion, a intense need of my own, to respond to my baby’s needs. This was hard when going somewhere as modern cars require babies to be buckled into carseats not mother’s arms, so we cocooned at home a lot.  <br>\n<br>\nAnd it was hard, at first, when relatives who felt entitled to hold the new baby swooped him out of my arms, and they ignored his cries when he wanted to come back to me.  After only a few family visits, my innate shyness and lifetime eagerness to please my elders was superhumanly overridden by the primal drive to listen to my baby, and keep him calm and comfortable in my arms.  I channelled my inner fierce mother cat, and was able to firmly and confidently say no, when others thought it was fine to let my baby to cry for me while loving elders held him for their own pleasure.  My instincts told me the meanings behind the sounds of his cries, and my instincts drove me to listen and respond. <br>\n<br>\nSociety told me I was too attached, spoiling him, overprotective, possessive. Society told me I was too emotional, needed to get out more without the baby, should go back to work. Society told me women with graduate degrees shouldn’t waste their education. Society told me bottles, babysitters, pacifiers, cribs and electric monitors, were just as good --no---were *better* for the baby than having just mama.  Society posted a billboard on the freeway near my town with a giant photo of a newborn on laying her back in a crib wearing a onesie with the words, “I (heart) my crib”, stating this was the only safe option for loving parents.  I literally gagged.  Society told me that holding my baby while he slept was ridiculous and dangerous, even though that’s the only way he would sleep for the first year. I learned to hold him in a carrier during the day, and I got very strong, and I cherished the moments which I instinctively knew would pass all too soon.<br>\n<br>\n=====<br>\nTo the emotional mother of an infant at the end of her six-week maternity leave, dropping her tiny baby off at daycare, society says, “I know it’s hard, but you’ll get use to it. We all had to do it too. It’s harder on us than it is the baby. Daycare is better for him. He’ll be fine.”<br>\n<br>\nTo the emotional mother of a tightly clinging, crying three year old, trying to drop off to near strangers at preschool, society says, “Let go, pry him off, don’t look back. He’s too attached. Getting away from you will be good for him. Drink wine. He’ll be fine.”<br>\n<br>\nTo the emotional mother of an eight year old school-refuser, with stomach aches, nightmares and depression due to fears of bullies, anxiety from academic pressure, and stress from being away from home and mama and happiness too many hours, days, weeks, months, years, society says, “Homeschooling would be a cop out. Make her face her fears.  She needs to grow up.  Don’t baby her. She’ll be fine. Maybe meds will help. She has to learn.”<br>\n<br>\nShe has to learn that society demands we ignore our instincts that tell us to get ourselves the hell out of dangerous, oppressive situations.  She has to learn that society demands we ignore our strong desires to be with our mothers and fathers when we are babies and children.  Eight year olds should be completely adjusted by now to being on their own at school every day.  <br>\n<br>\nShe has to learn to ignore her instinct to seek out interesting things and leave the boring ones. She has to learn she can’t have everything she wants, she isn’t special, she doesn’t deserve anything unless she earns it with good behavior.  She has to stop being so attached to her parents.  She has to learn to do what is expected regardless of her feelings, regardless of how boring, monotonous, frustrating, limiting, difficult, stressful, hurtful, overwhelming, draining or scary.  No one cares about her feelings.  She has to follow the same rules as everyone else.  She has to learn to get along with all kinds of people.

It’s quite poetic, overall, and I want to save it on my website. <br/>\nI think it’s a shame for something this beautiful to be credited only to “anonymous,” but here it is.<br/>\n____________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 7 year old daughter was reading over my shoulder part of the time as I wrote, and it sparked some interesting discussion. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt got way too long, and I don&#39;t know if it fits anywhere, but you&#39;re welcome to use it, anonymously, please.<br/>\n____________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems we have lost many of our instincts through lack of use or by overriding them for modern purposes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was pregnant for the first time, I began to feel an intense drive to protect and provide for my baby, and that continued fiercely after he was born.  At night, I could wake up whenever he stirred, let him nurse whenever his body language told me he needed to, and he slept peacefully and safely on my chest or snuggled beside me like a kitten with its mother cat.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he cried, it tore at my heart, and I felt very strongly compelled to comfort him.  It was a strong physical drive, a compulsion, a intense need of my own, to respond to my baby’s needs. This was hard when going somewhere as modern cars require babies to be buckled into carseats not mother’s arms, so we cocooned at home a lot.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it was hard, at first, when relatives who felt entitled to hold the new baby swooped him out of my arms, and they ignored his cries when he wanted to come back to me.  After only a few family visits, my innate shyness and lifetime eagerness to please my elders was superhumanly overridden by the primal drive to listen to my baby, and keep him calm and comfortable in my arms.  I channelled my inner fierce mother cat, and was able to firmly and confidently say no, when others thought it was fine to let my baby to cry for me while loving elders held him for their own pleasure.  My instincts told me the meanings behind the sounds of his cries, and my instincts drove me to listen and respond. <br/>\n<br/>\nSociety told me I was too attached, spoiling him, overprotective, possessive. Society told me I was too emotional, needed to get out more without the baby, should go back to work. Society told me women with graduate degrees shouldn’t waste their education. Society told me bottles, babysitters, pacifiers, cribs and electric monitors, were just as good --no---were *better* for the baby than having just mama.  Society posted a billboard on the freeway near my town with a giant photo of a newborn on laying her back in a crib wearing a onesie with the words, “I (heart) my crib”, stating this was the only safe option for loving parents.  I literally gagged.  Society told me that holding my baby while he slept was ridiculous and dangerous, even though that’s the only way he would sleep for the first year. I learned to hold him in a carrier during the day, and I got very strong, and I cherished the moments which I instinctively knew would pass all too soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nTo the emotional mother of an infant at the end of her six-week maternity leave, dropping her tiny baby off at daycare, society says, “I know it’s hard, but you’ll get use to it. We all had to do it too. It’s harder on us than it is the baby. Daycare is better for him. He’ll be fine.”<br/>\n<br/>\nTo the emotional mother of a tightly clinging, crying three year old, trying to drop off to near strangers at preschool, society says, “Let go, pry him off, don’t look back. He’s too attached. Getting away from you will be good for him. Drink wine. He’ll be fine.”<br/>\n<br/>\nTo the emotional mother of an eight year old school-refuser, with stomach aches, nightmares and depression due to fears of bullies, anxiety from academic pressure, and stress from being away from home and mama and happiness too many hours, days, weeks, months, years, society says, “Homeschooling would be a cop out. Make her face her fears.  She needs to grow up.  Don’t baby her. She’ll be fine. Maybe meds will help. She has to learn.”<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has to learn that society demands we ignore our instincts that tell us to get ourselves the hell out of dangerous, oppressive situations.  She has to learn that society demands we ignore our strong desires to be with our mothers and fathers when we are babies and children.  Eight year olds should be completely adjusted by now to being on their own at school every day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe has to learn to ignore her instinct to seek out interesting things and leave the boring ones. She has to learn she can’t have everything she wants, she isn’t special, she doesn’t deserve anything unless she earns it with good behavior.  She has to stop being so attached to her parents.  She has to learn to do what is expected regardless of her feelings, regardless of how boring, monotonous, frustrating, limiting, difficult, stressful, hurtful, overwhelming, draining or scary.  No one cares about her feelings.  She has to follow the same rules as everyone else.  She has to learn to get along with all kinds of people. She has to get up when the alarm rings, not sleep when she’s tired; Learn to wait till eating time, not eat when she’s hungry; Train herself to go only at bathroom time, not when she feels the urge; Sit still when she needs to move; Participate even when she has a bad cold and would rather be snuggled on the couch with her mom, but can’t because rules say you can’t miss school without a written excuse from the doctor; Study all the subjects required for her age, not just the ones she’s interested in; Go to the same class for seven hours every weekday for nine months, even though her teacher clearly dislikes her and treats her meanly and therefore several of her classmates do too;  Ride the bus twice a day with older kids who’ve been doing all the above for many years and who attempt to ease some of their own frustrations by behaving as wildly inappropriately and rudely on the bus as they possibly can. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe has to learn to tolerate, fit in, don’t tattle, be a big girl, don’t be a baby, don’t complain, we all have to do things we don’t want to do.

It’s important, but it’s long.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the past year or so I’ve been ideas about the danger of slogans have been percolating in me.  It’s a bigger version of my list of phrases to avoid.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/phrases\">http://sandradodd.com/phrases</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThere are words and phrases that we can harboe in our super-ego (for another Freudian reference—is there another better newer word for that nowaday?)—our conscience, where the voices of parents or other relatives or teachers or bullies are stored up and play back at our subconcious mind live.  Deschooling usually involves some inventory and rearrangement of those.  Those are personal and internal.  Some people did NOT store “Why can’t you be more like _____ [brother/cousin/neighbor]?”  Others DID store one, and they’re still comparing themselves decades later.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I’m talking about external noises that we can identify with or respond to as though they ere solid truth or pressing warnings of actual danger.  Slogans.  Quotes.  Like “all things in moderation” which Leah Rose responded to so amazingly and I saved that here:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/moderation\">http://sandradodd.com/moderation</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBut here’s my question (FINALLY!)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat phrases are used to keep us from considering our natural knowledge, or the possible legitimacy of our instincts?<br/>\nSome of these might be inside some of us, too, but what is there that’s outside to squash thought or exploration of whether we might actually KNOW some things naturally?<br/>\n<br/>\nI’ll start a list and I want to collect other similar phrases.  If yours are from other than obvious Judeo-Christian sources, please give a clue to their cultural origin.<br/>\n<br/>\nbase instinct  (“Don’t give in to your base instincts.”—not a quote from one person, but a thing older peole used to say as advice, about sex.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOvercome your “urges&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSatan will tempt you<br/>\n<br/>\n“What do YOU know?!” (the &quot;stop thinking and go read a book by an expert&quot; put-down)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If it tastes bad it must be good for you.” (or “If it tasted good, it wouldn’t be good for you.”)  That one was kind of a joke, but was about “medicines,” some of which are now shocking, though people who made kids take them are still around.  Perigoric.  Cod liver oil.  Castor oil.<br/>\n<br/>\n“Lean not to thine own understanding” (a Biblical put-down)<br/>\nFor anyone who did not grow up hearing that, good for you. If you’re curious, here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=lean+not+to+thine+own+understanding&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8\">https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=lean+not+to+thine+own+understanding&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWomen’s intuition was more often insulted than praised.<br/>\n“Old wives’ tales” was a put-down of what women thought they knew from observation and experience.  Sometimes “old wives tale” does describe something weird and wrong, but the phrase itself was used to pooh-pooh “unscientific” knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nWomen were  (still are) insulted even for discussing things in the way women learn from one another—by sharing and comparing stories of biological and social matters.  “Gossip”—not a nice word.  “Don’t gossip” is extended to ANY discussion, about childbirth or what causes marriages to succeed or to fail.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne reason these ideas should be considered by unschoolers is that we are braving the “unscientific” world of raising our children separate from the (unnatural, but pervasive and accepted) school system.  There IS no research we can provide for the whole radical unschooling package.   Sometimes there’s a bit here or there, to defend one aspect or another.   And I’m not saying we should submit our children for research, either.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I’m suggesting is that for clarity and courage, it will help for unschoolers to be wary of slogans and of truisms, and continue to consider whether input is useful to our relationships with our children or spouses, or whether it is intended to control or shame or dissuade us from thinking our own careful thoughts, and making the best decisions we can make based on what we know, and feel.  <br/>\n<br/>\nToo many people let the sway of popular culture tell them what curlers to put in their chopped-off hair (in the 1950’) or what tattoos and piercings will make them cool, and while popular culture can be fun, and there are benefits of going along to get along (another slogan), be aware that you’re part of a trend or a fad.  Don’t confuse culture with the real life beneath that changing gloss.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Instinct","postDate":"1494856380","msgId":78000,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZEMjFBNUJGLTU3QUEtNEYzMC1CQ0VBLUUzM0EyOTJBQzVERkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDM4QTgwMjA5LTE3MUEtNDYzRS05QzJGLTZBMEMyMkE3MkFGRkB5YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDEwNUZFREUwLTczNDMtNEYwMi05QkVCLTcxMDY5Qjg5RURBQUBnbWFpbC5jb20+IDw5RTI2M0NCNy1CMjg4LTQzODItOTQ5Ni1EODNBOTBBNURBNERAeWFob28uY29tPiA8MzhBODAyMDktMTcxQS00NjNFLTlDMkYtNkEwQzIyQTcyQUZGQHlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":77999,"nextInTopic":78001,"prevInTime":77999,"nextInTime":78001,"topicId":77982,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Fetal not feral ……-=- But as Freudian slips go (or typos by English-as-second-language writers), that’s a really good one!

And when “feral behavior” includes behavior learned from the wolf or monkey foster family, that’s even more interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis topic has been unpopular in our culture (and maybe in most or all) because of the human “need” (instinct??) to consider themselves something other than, and above and beyond, animals.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is cultural too, but consider it as an analogy for a moment. <br/>\nWhen I was young and impressionable (imprinting my culture) in the 1960’s and 70’s, and the women’s movement was vibrant and Ms. Magazine was new, we noted and discussed the natural and the exaggerated differenced between men and women.  Strength.  Hair on heads.  Body hair.  Clothing (rights, laws, traditions).  Behaviors (how to sit or walk or stand).  <br/>\n<br/>\nCulturally, those things were exaggerated.  Women DID shave armpits and legs, and quietly remove any odd facial hair, and tried to bleach arm hair if it was too dark.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor hippies, for guys to have long hair, and for women to let their armpit hair grow, and to go without a bra…. those things were SHOCKING to older people, but it was experimentation with what might be “normal” because life was so far from any idea of what “normal” might be for humans.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to allow hair to do what hair would do—be straight, or frizzy, or kinky, and to grow as long as it naturally could (which is different for different individuals, but at the time that was NOT known because no one had ever let hair just grow, men and women both, in natural ways)—that went against cultural traditions of fashions of putting hair up, cutting hair off, cutting it the length that worked well with the curlers of the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose things skirt instinct, block it, mask it, hint at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore Darwin, the idea that humans could have instinct was lumped in with sin and Satan, possession, demons.

Apparently newborns like being bundled up tightly because its what they are used to being squashed into a womb. It was quite funny to see how unwrapping him would start him crying instantly and wrapping him again would stop the crying. He is 13 now and still sleeps all bundled up with blankets tucked in tightly and barely moves all night.</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879\">Dakotah fought like crazy on day one to force one arm out of her swaddling blanket. She would keep fighting until she freed both arms and legs, then she would relax. We never bundled her up because she clearly disliked it. Today (she’s 12) she sleeps with arms and legs out of her blankets and rarely keeps them on all night even when it’s particularly cold. She’s a restless sleeper who thrashes around.</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879\">These two opposite behaviours started literally on day 1 and those personality traits have persisted to this day. There was zero nurture there - is was and still is part of their personalities. This incident, and many more over the years, have convinced me there is indeed some amount of hard-wiring in all of us. We may be less instinctual because we are born so much less developed than animals are, mainly because we need to be morn before our head and brain size makes birth impossible, but I’m convinced we have instincts.</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879\">Anecdotal and unscientific but interesting I think?</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879\">Cheers.</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879\">Richard</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879\"><div><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote type=\"cite\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879\"><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879\">On 13 May 2017, at 9:50 AM, Joanne Gardner <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joannegardner76@...\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879\">joannegardner76@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:</div><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879Apple-interchange-newline\"><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879ygrp-mlmsg\" style=\"font-size:13px;font-family:Arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879ygrp-msg\" style=\"line-height:1.22em;\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879ygrp-text\" style=\"line-height:1.22em;font-family:Georgia;\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879\"><div style=\"line-height:1.22em;margin:0px 0px 1em;\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879webkit-block-placeholder\"></div><div style=\"line-height:1.22em;\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879\">Hi,&nbsp;<div style=\"line-height:1.22em;\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879\"><br style=\"line-height:1.22em;\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879\"></div><div style=\"line-height:1.22em;\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1494770879\">I was born in 76 and was taught nothing about instincts in school until our Catholic High school showed us a video.

We are born knowing it or our hormones dictate it.  Many of the scenarios described so far where people have acted instinctively have involved very complex assessments of cultural situations. We cannot know if this is instinctive or learned, can we?  I have learned (can’t remember where, sorry)  that the reason our brains are so big is that we spend enormous amounts of energy and brain power on reading complex social situations, faces etc.  Way way more than any other species. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a species we raise our young in communities and family groups.  They would not survive without this intense care, which is instinctive, but which is then totally tied up with cultural learning too.  Instinctive behaviour in some animals is easier to identify as their nurturing by their parents and communities is less or non-existent.  Therefore we often think of ‘instinct’ as an animal quality.<br/>\nIt is of course impossible, morally, to do formal experiments where we raise humans without this element of cultural learning and social upbringing so true instinct is very hard to identify.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf a human behaviour is truly instinctive I would have imagined it would be apparent throughout all the different cultures - language, for example.  Whereas a reluctance to put a child in daycare would seem to me to be a reaction to a specific cultural situation that the person assessed, thought about and decided it felt wrong for them - there are many human communities that raise their children communally.<br/>\n <br/>\nJust another perspective  to add to the data dump - sorry I have no references or quotes :-(<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBelinda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":359203961,"authorName":"Anna Black","from":"Anna Black &lt;anna.black@...&gt;","profile":"annavblack99","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Instinct","postDate":"1494826492","msgId":77993,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZERkY1Mjc5LTZDNjktNDQ1MC1BMDUzLTYwRTZEM0E2RjE2NEB5N21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":77992,"nextInTopic":77994,"prevInTime":77992,"nextInTime":77994,"topicId":77982,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I was born in 1972.

I don’t remember learning much about instinct in humans or animals at school or university.  In fact, the word instinct makes me think most strongly of Star Wars - Obi Wan Kenobi covering Luke’s eye’s and saying “Act..on..instinct’. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think I notice instinct most strongly when I’m going against it or resisting it in some way.  Although I’ve mostly thought of it as intuition. One time I reacted instinctively was when I had a bad feeling about a particular older child at a party, and made sure to observe her interactions with my daughter closely.  I stepped in and separated them when I thought she was trying to isolate my daughter, who was a few years younger than her.  I found out later there had been the beginning of some coerced sexual experimentation so I was very thankful I had paid attention to whatever was warning me and acted on that feeling. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe intuition is an instinct?  it’s certainly not something I learned.  The only learned behaviour would be paying attention to it or not paying attention.  And it’s difficult as often, at least for me, it’s mixed up with anxiety or worry.  I am thinking right now of my most recent worry about my dog; I thought his muzzle and gums were unusually pink and started worrying about an unnoticed infection.  I decided to leave him over night and see how he was in the morning before making a vet appointment.  He was perfectly fine the next day. So was that instinct or intuition?  Or was I just worrying unnecessarily? <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are things I have felt literally unable to do.  Things like leave my babies to cry or take them to daycare.  Is that instinct?  It’s a very strong feeling. I felt I would be doing violence to myself if I went against that feeling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have no doubt that my babies instinctually assisted with the birth process.  I remember feeling the kicks and wriggles as my second baby was born.  And both crawled to the breast and self-attached just like baby kangaroos do.  I think this is all instinctual, but in some cases the instinctual response is somewhat fragile and can be interrupted by, for example, the baby being removed and cleaned before being placed on the mother’s body, or any other separation. Newborns have reflexes, the rooting reflex, the stepping reflex.  I suppose those are instinctual behaviours, they’re certainly not learned. <br/>\n<br/>\nAre reflex and instinct the same?  I have reached to grab both my children without thinking at different times when they’ve been falling or otherwise in danger.  My husband always throws his arm out to ‘protect’ me if he’s driving and stops more suddenly than usual.  It’s not a decision he makes in the moment, it’s a reflex or instinctual protective response to danger.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":564662503,"authorName":"Shira Rocklin","from":"Shira Rocklin &lt;sj.rocklin@...&gt;","profile":"shirarocklin","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Instinct","postDate":"1494736467","msgId":77991,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBQk5SZUZ2Yz1wNHY5dzlKUW1IMGRlVXI9aUYxXzQzNHR3QWUwSFdoUDZKejZYOVZtd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":77990,"nextInTopic":77992,"prevInTime":77990,"nextInTime":77992,"topicId":77982,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t remember being taught anything about human instincts one way or the other.

I was told that the more dependent and slow growing the babies were, the more they needed to learn from the mom.  So some animals also were more like humans.  I remember the discussion moving to animal languages.  And the idea was that humans learn their language from parents but animals know it instinctively- like birds know their song instinctively.  I also remember in college (where I studied biology) when I learned that some birds learn their songs as young birds, improving over time, and each bird&#39;s song is individual to the bird. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy first personal experience with instincts was as a young child feeling dizzy from being way up high and looking down.  My dad told me some people inherit an instinctive fear of heights.  I remember connecting that feeling with the feeling I would get in a piano recital.  I wondered if I inherited an instinct to stay away from performing also (I did!!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, as a mother, I experienced mothering instincts really intensely.  I still have a strong instinctive response to any crying baby even though I no longer have a child that young.  Thanks to La Leche League and Continuum Concept support groups, I didn&#39;t try to ignore those instincts.  I nursed my babies and responded to every cry.  I even learned that I could instinctively tell when they needed to pee/poo or nurse, preventing the need for cries.  I remember feeling like this mothering was exactly my soul purpose.  There was nothing I&#39;d rather do.  I felt completely fulfilled.  I wonder if that&#39;s what it feels like to be an animal and to follow instincts.  Do animals always feel fulfilled like that?<br/>\n<br/>\nAli</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":430722916,"authorName":"","from":"mellingersa@...","profile":"mellingersa","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Instinct","postDate":"1494687125","msgId":77989,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0OTQ2ODcxMjUuMjE3Njg5NTdAZjQubXkuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDc0OUIxOUQwLUNEQTItNDQ4MS04RjZFLTEzRjE4RTAwMDlFRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDc0OUIxOUQwLUNEQTItNDQ4MS04RjZFLTEzRjE4RTAwMDlFRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":77988,"nextInTopic":77990,"prevInTime":77988,"nextInTime":77990,"topicId":77982,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I truly believe in instinct in human beings but I also think especially in western society it s often ignored.

I made it unharmed through hitchhiking across Africa, working and living in slums, joining a team to help refugees of the Ruanda war and many more.</div><div>Now, one could argue that was just lucky but in retrospective I remember several situations when I changed plans drastically because of an unsafe feeling.</div><div>In my late twenties I had another experience that I account to instinct. I for a long time had 2 small knots in my thyroid which were followed by an endocrinologist. I was always re-assured that they were harmless and the risk of taking them out much higher than the risk that they would ever become malignant. I would say it was probably 8-10 years into having these knots that I got the feeling of &quot;I want them out&quot;. I had another checkup and the physician told me they had grown a tiny little bit but there was no reason to be concerned. I was concerned though and found despite many people telling me &quot;I was not rational&quot; a surgeon who would take them out for me. The day after the surgery he came to me and said that the pathology had come back as cancer and that he needed to go back and take the whole thyroid out. I had to have lymph-nodes removed and underwent radio iodine therapy because the cancer cells had already broken through the organ capsule. This was roughly 20 years ago and due to having the surgery I&#39;m healthy today. Again, maybe just lucky or coincidence but ever since I do trust my instincts. Unschooling actually came for us out of trusting those instincts. It never felt &quot;right&quot; to send my son to school. In the beginning I was waiting for the day it would but it never came.</div><div><br></div><div>Sabine</div><div><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-759977473mail-app-auto-default-signature\"><br><br>Sent from myMail for iOS<br></div><br><br>Friday, May 12, 2017, 3:21 PM -0700 from Sandra Dodd Sandra@...
