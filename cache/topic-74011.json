I was thinking about how this idea of seeing TV, games, movies as &quot;passive&quot; stimulation links in with the notion that just because kids are &quot;not focused&quot; on what is happening, they can&#39;t be paying attention.  I&#39;m thinking about how my own kids play on their iPads while they watch Avatar, or practice handstands while also listening to the radio or an audiobook.  It is kind of like changing your understanding about what learning is…paying attention or listening can take different forms for different people.  Focus doesn&#39;t require that you do one thing only at a time; in fact, for lots of people, focus requires more than one activity be carried on simultaneously.<br/>\n<br/>\nJustine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"How to appreciate TV, games, movies","postDate":"1396500688","msgId":74011,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdDQjQ3RjY1LTZBRTAtNEIxQS1COEMwLTBBMjM5RjlBNTY1MEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":74012,"prevInTime":74010,"nextInTime":74012,"topicId":74011,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"A page of my site was linked on a blog post.
