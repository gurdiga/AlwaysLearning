I&#39;m also a planner. As part of the time I occasionally spend with him in his room before bed, we often go over the schedule for the next day hour by hour, including any things that are uncertain or aren&#39;t planned yet. Most times he asks me for the schedule for the whole following week or even as many weeks as my memory will take us. <br/>\n<br/>\nI enjoy this time with him too. I find that if I let him know what&#39;s going on and the choices we need to make between conflicting activities or desires, the easier time we have. He can understand that I need to stay home to do laundry this day but we have friends who&#39;ve invited us to go swimming the next day, for instance. I do this with his sister too, but more to her tastes. She doesn&#39;t need to know as much, and would just as soon count to 100 in the dark (her idea). I&#39;m constantly amazed by what their requests show about how their minds work. <br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Thu, Jun 14, 2012 at 11:19 AM, Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; she is ALWAYS asking &quot;what are we going to do NEXT?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I feel that she is not present and in the moment, but rather<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; taking her &quot;now&quot; moment to think about what wll happen NEXT.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My oldest daughter used to ask, &quot;What&#39;s next?&quot; as we turned into our<br/>\n&gt; driveway even when we&#39;d had a sparkly exciting fun-filled adventurous day.<br/>\n&gt; Once we&#39;d been at Disneyland from morning until late night and we turned<br/>\n&gt; into our driveway and she woke up from her happy/tired drowsiness to ask,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;What&#39;s next?&quot; I just said, &quot;Bed,&quot; and she was happy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But, she really likes to always have a social calendar and activity list<br/>\n&gt; lined up - she wants to know that something cool is coming up.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She&#39;s 27 and still like that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -pam<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":333388203,"authorName":"Rinelle","from":"&quot;Rinelle&quot; &lt;rinelle@...&gt;","profile":"rinelle2011","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] How do I?","postDate":"1339842302","msgId":67691,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk5Qzc3MjU1MEVENjQ1N0M4Q0Q2RDRBRTlFRDY0OEI4QFJpbmVsbGVQQz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDI2RjQ2MTQ2LTkyNTYtNDhGQi04MzMyLTU2MTE0OUVGMjE1N0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGpyZDcxZCtmY2czQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MjZGNDYxNDYtOTI1Ni00OEZCLTgzMzItNTYxMTQ5RUYyMTU3QHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":67669,"nextInTopic":67696,"prevInTime":67690,"nextInTime":67692,"topicId":67661,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
