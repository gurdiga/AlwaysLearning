But I might join one. ;) <br/>\n<br/>\nI do like this list because it makes me think about things. I don&#39;t think things out in posts but take it with me & ponder before making decisions or forming opinions. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have a name for what I do. What I do has changed with time. The focus is different for each of my children because they are individuals. I believe it&#39;s my duty to guide them through to adulthood. They haven&#39;t made all the decision because they&#39;re children.But I&#39;ve found that they are at the point where they just check their balance and thinkithings out with their mentor/guide/mom. Hey, I still check with my mentors/guides/elders.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do like the philosophy that is offered here. But many of the suggestions on this list just don&#39;t work in practice for my kids. I don&#39;t do what doesn&#39;t work. I don&#39;t feel compelled to blast people for things they say have worked for them, but haven&#39;t worked for me. I don&#39;t need to make anyone wrong. I can just say to myself, well good that it worked for them and move on to something that will work for us.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra and Joyce have pointed out they don&#39;t consider what I do to be unschooling. I don&#39;t know what to call what I&#39;ve done all these years I can say it has worked for us and it&#39;s not school at home. Will I offend or get blasted if I call it individual learning?  I understand that educating themselves got nixed. <br/>\n <br/>\nSo what do I have? What do I do? My three teens are so delightful. Life is calm, busy, interesting, musical, exciting.

He&#39;s not logical in the sense of being able to pull together a bunch of parts into a whole. He can experience a whole and develop an understanding of how its made up of parts, though. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome people do really well the other way &#39;round - they like to see that parts of things and discover or invent or envision the whole, and given a whole they start pulling it apart. The parts are fascinating! Mo&#39;s more a parts person. <br/>\n<br/>\nIts not a black and white thing, like some people only see parts and some only wholes, the human mind is more sophisticated than that. Everyone does both to an extent, but everyone also favors one way to thinking, naturally. Some people call those differences &quot;logical&quot; and &quot;intuitive&quot; thinking, but those words are also loaded with cultural baggage that can get in the way. <br/>\n<br/>\nIts good to know that there are differences like that from the perspecitve of radical unschoolin - our kids don&#39;t always process in the same way we do. My pair think and solve problems very differently from one another!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list - most unschooling lists and discussions - involves a lot of looking at parts. That&#39;s not something that&#39;s going to be helpful for everyone! Some people prefer to post in a style that&#39;s more gestalt, and I bet some people like to read those kinds of posts, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there seems to be too much pulling things apart here, for your (general &quot;you&quot;) needs, you could keep looking, see what other lists are out there, or create an &quot;Intuitive Unschooling&quot; list and hold different kinds of discussions if you wanted. The dominent writers on any list will set the style, so invite people to come post who have a more wholistic writing style. Alternately, you might be the sort of person who does better reading essays and blogs, rather than the more q&a style of an email list or forum, so I&#39;ll take a moment to plug an unschooling site with a focus on blogs and a monthly set of essays:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://enjoylifeunschooling.com/\">http://enjoylifeunschooling.com/</a><br/>\nThere you&#39;ll see a &quot;blog carnival&quot; about sleep (pertinent to a recent thread) and also essays about sibling issues and atypical kids. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] As our process changes","postDate":"1278699203","msgId":55776,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENEN0JBRkNGLUNCMjMtNEM3Ri1CNUM2LTU1ODMzMDYzMEE2N0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGkxN2ljMitsMWFyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGkxN2ljMitsMWFyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":55775,"nextInTopic":55777,"prevInTime":55775,"nextInTime":55777,"topicId":55775,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-With my children, questions are encouraged.

It seems that the place/age/experience created the space for either misunderstanding or an opportunity for growth. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith my children, questions are encouraged.

This has made me softer in my delivery of information because I&#39;m open to language and bridges that can be built rather than jumping on a word or phrase and perhaps alienating or damaging a friend, supporter, co-non-school-traveler. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband has brain-damage from an accident, his language can be difficult and really frustrating for me. He&#39;ll insert the wrong word. Most of the time we can figure out what he meant by context but sometimes it&#39;s just... well, it is what it is... I&#39;ve learned that it&#39;s better to listen to the whole of the message instead of getting hung up on particular words. I save making an issue of word for when the context isn&#39;t clear, because really we&#39;re trying to communicate not judge each other. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe following was clipped & sent for two reasons 1) I liked it and wanted to share it but 2) and more importantly, it shows that the unschooling / homeschooling / out-of-the-box  people have always had to explain ~this~ is what I mean when I say ~that~.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We have to educate ourselves to know who we are.
