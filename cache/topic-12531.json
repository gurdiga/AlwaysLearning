He told me to put 5<br/>\ndifferent rows of numbers because he wanted to make sure he could add up<br/>\ncolumns.  I did 1 whole sheet which he insisted I check for being correct<br/>\n(that&#39;s first 4 planets in Virgo and his perfectionism!!) and then he was<br/>\noff doing something else and didn&#39;t ask about them again.  Last night at<br/>\n10pm we were reading a book on the planets (he&#39;s learning astronomy and<br/>\nastrology now that he knows the difference) and it probably took us 1/2 hour<br/>\nto get through the book because of all the questions he was asking that<br/>\nthankfully I could answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I&#39;m rambling here....
