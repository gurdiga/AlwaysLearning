Not embarassed. I used to<br/>\nget alot of those moments, where others discuss their children in a<br/>\nnegative way, but the past few years or so, the conversations have<br/>\nturned tides.  I couldnt put my finger on it  but I think this is why:<br/>\n<br/>\n It&#39;s great that you have older <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; children and know that the parent/child relationship can be different <br/>\n&gt; and you have the proof that your way is BETTER ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>not only do I have older children, but i still have a crew of smallies<br/>\nas well.  Where ever I go, there are a bunch of us.  And it is obvious<br/>\nwe are happy together and having a good time.  And they are what<br/>\npeople call &quot;good children&quot; in the sense that they dont race about or<br/>\ntalk back or act sullen.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd because Ive always said that I have so many children because I<br/>\nlike them (schuyler, your blog post was just beautiful--ive stuck it<br/>\nin my translating bag)...well Im thinking that the moments for people<br/>\nto start complaining just wash away because Ive chosen in the past few<br/>\nyears to be the mentor: if I can do it, anybody can.  You just need<br/>\nthe desire. That is how I present myself now. I am proud of being a<br/>\nmamma of 7, I have earned my masters degree and am working on my phd<br/>\nin mothering so to speak--<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So when you find <br/>\n&gt; yourself in that situation, ground yourself in your truth.  Instead of <br/>\n&gt; feeling out of it, you could choose to be the mentor.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>so thank you for making this so clear.  Ive been doing it but not<br/>\nconciously thinking it as a motto.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Depending on the other parents involved I&#39;ve been known to say:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Do you ever say anything nice about your children?&quot; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t find that to be true about teenagers at all!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I have two teens and think they&#39;re fabulous!!!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;ve loved every stage that my children have gone through.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s hurting my spirit to hear you say all these negative things about <br/>\n&gt; your child.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Do you say that where your child can HEAR you??&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;So....tell me something good about your child.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes! I also ask <br/>\n  &quot; when is the last time you actually looked in your childs eyes and<br/>\nsmiled?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Complaining about children has become a bonding ritual in our cut <br/>\n&gt; up/isolated society..a way that someone can quickly find &quot;common <br/>\n&gt; ground&quot; with another.  &quot;oh...we both have kids??  Let&#39;s complain about <br/>\n&gt; them!&quot;  Kind of like moaning about your sports team.  So much like <br/>\n&gt; saying &quot;sorry...I&#39;m not into sports&quot;  you can state your position of <br/>\n&gt; not being into child-bashing.  And then find something that you can <br/>\n&gt; talk about.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Exactly!  Its okay to not be interested in a topic of conversation.<br/>\nAnd it is totally okay to shift conversations to a different pov.  So<br/>\nwhy not when the conversation is about child bashing, or husband<br/>\nbashing ? its okay to say, hey, my kids are great, and I think yours<br/>\nprobably are too, if you took the time to see it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more you see it, the more they will be it.<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks mary for such a nice direct post.<br/>\nmelissa in italy<br/>\nmamma of 7 <br/>\nand loving every minute.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: people complaining about their own kids","postDate":"1215837734","msgId":36458,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYzNzkzRkUyLTQ5NjEtNEYxMy04MUFFLTIyOTI0QjYwQzBEREBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgwNzExMjEwOGcxOTFmMDg3NnUzZDA5N2FkNmMxMWFkNWVlQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDlFMjkyQzNELUI1ODgtNEVENC1CMjlGLURGQUJCMTZGMDc3NUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0PiA8ZzU4Nmo0K284a2dAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDw2NTE4YTkzNjA4MDcxMTIwNDdwMWMwMDI5MzZ5YjAzODRlMzYwMDNmNmFjNkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDNhOTNmZmYxMDgwNzExMjEwOGcxOTFmMDg3NnUzZDA5N2FkNmMxMWFkNWVlQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":36457,"nextInTopic":36460,"prevInTime":36457,"nextInTime":36459,"topicId":36354,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Part of what holds parents up is the posts I ve seen lately around unschooling boards about guilt for not *getting it* sooner. -=- How does that hold them","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1043505307\">-=-Part of what holds parents up is the<br/>\nposts I&#39;ve seen lately around unschooling boards about guilt for not<br/>\n*getting it* sooner. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does that hold them up?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere, I have a whole collection of them:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/ifonly\">http://sandradodd.com/ifonly</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think that&#39;s keeping people from moving forward?<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: people complaining about their own kids","postDate":"1215835706","msgId":36457,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgwNzExMjEwOGcxOTFmMDg3NnUzZDA5N2FkNmMxMWFkNWVlQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY1MThhOTM2MDgwNzExMjA0N3AxYzAwMjkzNnliMDM4NGUzNjAwM2Y2YWM2QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDlFMjkyQzNELUI1ODgtNEVENC1CMjlGLURGQUJCMTZGMDc3NUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0PgkgPGc1ODZqNCtvOGtnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgkgPDY1MThhOTM2MDgwNzExMjA0N3AxYzAwMjkzNnliMDM4NGUzNjAwM2Y2YWM2QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":36456,"nextInTopic":36458,"prevInTime":36456,"nextInTime":36458,"topicId":36354,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Seventeen is way better than never.

But then it got  worse and I lowered my eyes, <br/>\nbecause I was afraid if anyone looked at me, they  could see exactly how I <br/>\nfelt. After a story where the older kid &quot;allowed&quot; a  younger sibling to do <br/>\nsomething without stopping it or telling a parent and the  mom said she told the <br/>\nolder kid he was going to be in &#39;way more trouble than the  little one because he <br/>\nallowed it, I shrank in my seat and wanted to leave.

No, it wasn&#39;t pressure... A different lead to follow? Maybe. At any  rate, <br/>\nthat conversation, one-on-one ended up going much better and more hopeful  and <br/>\npositive. It made what could have ended as a bummer night into a pretty good  <br/>\none.<br/>\n <br/>\nI guess it depends on the people and the situation.

She went on and on and finally I said something like &quot;when I feel like Alex and I are having some problems communicating, I realize we haven&#39;t spent any time cuddling lately, so I invite her to cuddle and watch a movie together or share a book or simply talk.  This helps us to reconnect and we tend to communicate better and life together more peacefully.&quot;  I thought it was a really good suggestion, but she just looked at me open mouthed.  Her child, she said, wouldn&#39;t even allow a quick hug, or a pat on the back.  She didn&#39;t want her mother to touch her at all.  She could not believe that my 12 year old loved to cuddle still.  It was my turn to look at her open mouthed--how could she not cuddle her child?   I really didn&#39;t know what to say.  I suggested she start slowly, and reminded her that even adults need physical comfort and cuddling, and especially teens did.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I really enjoy being with my kids too, but it&#39;s hard to be a single parent--I don&#39;t have anyone to talk to about this sort of thing.

The ones I still  <br/>\nsee and talk to are the ones with great kids - who like their kids and  <br/>\nwho hang out as a family. Not a coincidence that those are the ones I  <br/>\nstayed friends with, I&#39;m sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not always happy with my kids. They aren&#39;t always happy with me.  <br/>\n&gt; But I<br/>\n&gt; think hard not to put negative labels on them *especially in my own  <br/>\n&gt; head*.<br/>\n&gt; Declaring a person selfish, whiny, shallow, rude, inconsiderate,  <br/>\n&gt; meanspirited,<br/>\n&gt; dishonest, untrustworthy, etc. etc. locks them into that box, if  <br/>\n&gt; only in my own<br/>\n&gt; mind, so that ordinary human behaviours take on extraordinary  <br/>\n&gt; negative meanings,<br/>\n&gt; and perhaps temporary conditions gain weight and gravity and  <br/>\n&gt; substance.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I couldn&#39;t agree more. I think this is the crux of what makes me so  <br/>\nuncomfortable. I don&#39;t want to claim that I&#39;m always totally thrilled  <br/>\nwith my kids in every possible way - or them with me. But there is no  <br/>\nWAY I&#39;m going to sit around and complain. And, overall, our lives are  <br/>\nSO good. And, I don&#39;t want to label my kids with those negative terms  <br/>\nfor all the reasons Deb gave above.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I try really really hard not to go around complaining about my kids.  <br/>\n&gt; Okay,<br/>\n&gt; that sounds like I&#39;m walking around a lot *feeling* like  <br/>\n&gt; complaining, which<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t true at all. I mean that when I *am* for one reason or another  <br/>\n&gt; having<br/>\n&gt; conflicts with or worries about one of my kids, that I try to be  <br/>\n&gt; especially aware of<br/>\n&gt; how I talk/write about them to other people. It seems to me that it is<br/>\n&gt; harmful to our relationship for me to engage in that sort of  <br/>\n&gt; negative talk where<br/>\n&gt; people seem to be looking mostly for hand patting &quot;there there&quot; and  <br/>\n&gt; agreement<br/>\n&gt; that parenting is hard and kids can be so awful (the same sort of  <br/>\n&gt; complaining a<br/>\n&gt; lot of women seem to get into about husbands, for that matter).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s hard.

Sometimes I just look at the parents and<br/>\nlisten as openmindedly as I can (not easy for me) because many people really<br/>\naren&#39;t remembering much about being that age.  Many people also choose avoid<br/>\nmuch memory of being a teen or young adult themselves as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s easier to focus on the point that they as parents are uncomfortable<br/>\nright then and there.  And why wouldn&#39;t they be?  Many of them have made<br/>\nsome choices that are not so good.  I wouldn&#39;t point it out because they<br/>\ncan&#39;t change back then.  We can only act in the present.  And people who<br/>\ndidn&#39;t realize all that about their choices then usually do not want to<br/>\nrealize it now either.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir view is that as parents they are victims of circumstances.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s little consideration about how children or people just *are* or<br/>\nabout how people develop from one age to another.  They don&#39;t really<br/>\nunderstand growth as a process, except perhaps physically and maybe a little<br/>\nbit mentally and psychologically.  Their understanding hinges on fragments<br/>\nof the whole process.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, I also think many people don&#39;t believe in change.  I&#39;ve heard<br/>\nthis a lot: &quot;People don&#39;t change.&quot;  I feel so differently.  I *have*<br/>\nchanged.  What they see part of is that change is not automatic.  And that<br/>\n*is* true, even if that&#39;s not exactly the words they use to express the<br/>\nphenomenon.<br/>\n<br/>\nChanging yourself and your life requires a whole different way of thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 7/10/08, Pamela Sorooshian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   This seems to be coming up for me over and over, these days.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think it is because my kids are pretty much grown up and busy with<br/>\n&gt; their own stuff and I&#39;m spending more time with other adults, without<br/>\n&gt; the kids around.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So - what&#39;s happening is that the other adults are complaining a lot<br/>\n&gt; about their own kids.
