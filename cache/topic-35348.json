I&#39;m a high<br/>\nschool dropout with no formal qualifications. Our daughter is an<br/>\nalways schooled university graduate. Our son went to school for two<br/>\nyears and has been at home with me for the past five and he decides<br/>\nfor himself what he&#39;s interested in and what he isn&#39;t. Only one of us<br/>\nwould be recognised as &#39;unschooled&#39; but we&#39;re all self-motivated<br/>\nlearners. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, self-motivated learning means &quot;don&#39;t wait for somebody else to<br/>\ndecide they want to teach you&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow that fits in with parenting: my wife and I honour our children&#39;s<br/>\nself-authority (&quot;Only I know what&#39;s best for me&quot;) and we expect them<br/>\nto honour ours. That manifests in a tendency for everyone to do what<br/>\nthey like and not do what they don&#39;t like. Including go to school or<br/>\ndon&#39;t go to school. The existence of school or no school as an option<br/>\nis incidental in itself. My son is out of school because of what my<br/>\nwife and I believe about parenting, not because of what we believe<br/>\nabout school.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore my daughter started school at the age of five, she had the same<br/>\nlifestyle of maximum freedom her brother has now; after she started<br/>\nschool, it became a part-time lifestyle. At all times she was out of<br/>\nschool, she was free to do what she liked and not do what she didn&#39;t<br/>\nlike. She continued to choose her own bedtime even when she was at<br/>\nschool the next day and she chose to do her school homework. She was<br/>\nnever once asked to do it, she did it anyway. Whenever she wanted a<br/>\nday off school, she had a day off school no questions asked, and I<br/>\nwould happily fabricate the &#39;sick note&#39; she was required to give to<br/>\nher teacher the next day. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s impossible for my wife and I not to have influenced our<br/>\nchildren&#39;s decisions about their own lives to some degree through the<br/>\ndecisions we&#39;ve made about what we want for ourselves. Which includes<br/>\nhappy and successful children. Whatever we&#39;ve perceived that to mean.<br/>\nWe&#39;ve never &#39;told&#39; our children to do anything, but our conversations<br/>\nwith them have often included suggestions and recommendations. Should<br/>\nour children choose to ignore or reject our alleged &#39;wisdom&#39;, we<br/>\naccept that and move on. There are occasions when we continue to<br/>\nbelieve we&#39;re right and we&#39;ll come back later to the same subject, and<br/>\nthen it&#39;s up to us to make our case. In conversations on the same<br/>\nsubject over time, our children will occasionally change their minds,<br/>\nand often they won&#39;t. It&#39;s okay either way. But, we want what we want,<br/>\nthe same as our children want what they want, and that&#39;s always going<br/>\nto be part of the equation.<br/>\n<br/>\nBob<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jenny C&quot; &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I hear the phrase &quot;child-led&quot; or &quot;child-directed&quot; a lot in the <br/>\n&gt; context of unschooling, either by non-unschoolers trying to describe <br/>\n&gt; unschooling or by unschoolers trying to describe unschooling to those <br/>\n&gt; that know nothing about it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The main issue that I have with those terms is that it leaves the <br/>\n&gt; parent out of the equation.  I&#39;ve never used it for that reason, and <br/>\n&gt; also because what we do at our house looks nothing like what those <br/>\n&gt; phrases imply.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I very much lead my kids.  As my older daughter has gotten older, <br/>\n&gt; she&#39;s done more and more of her own leading, but I still do a lot of <br/>\n&gt; initiating of things.  Actually as I&#39;m writing this, I&#39;m aware of the <br/>\n&gt; fact that the word &quot;lead&quot; is somewhat not the right word.  I <br/>\n&gt; think &quot;guide&quot; might be a better word all around.  I don&#39;t guide by <br/>\n&gt; compulsion, but more like a guidance counselor would do it, listen <br/>\n&gt; and watch and observe and offer direction and help as needed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I also have issues with &quot;radical&quot; unschooling too.  We either <br/>\n&gt; unschool or we don&#39;t.  Unschooling is extremely radical for most <br/>\n&gt; people already.  I also don&#39;t buy into the idea that any parent can <br/>\n&gt; unschool curriculum and not extend it farther into other areas of <br/>\n&gt; life and have unschooling work effectively (and I think this is what <br/>\n&gt; some mean when they say they unschool but not radically).  My own <br/>\n&gt; experience says that it can&#39;t be done without seriously damaging the <br/>\n&gt; parent/child relationship and trust issues that really make <br/>\n&gt; unschooling work as awesomely as it does.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Unschooling really seems more about relationships all around.  Which <br/>\n&gt; is mostly why &quot;child-led&quot; or &quot;child-directed&quot; is so problematic.  I <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know if John Holt ever intended unschooling to be what I&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt; come to know it as, but he certainly planted the seeds of change in <br/>\n&gt; the way we can raise our kids without forcible teaching.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] re: tech questions","postDate":"1213593861","msgId":35407,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg0NjExM0RCLUY0QzEtNEJFRC04OTBDLTg5MzdFMUUyNEQzMkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEY0RTFBRTlCLUE3MUQtNDVFOS1BODczLTAyOUY0MUEzNDE2REBtYWMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIyOTM0Ny43MTY4OC5xbUB3ZWI1MzgwOS5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+IDxGNEUxQUU5Qi1BNzFELTQ1RTktQTg3My0wMjlGNDFBMzQxNkRAbWFjLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":35397,"nextInTopic":35411,"prevInTime":35406,"nextInTime":35408,"topicId":35348,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is a possible fix for the glitches in the yahoogroups posts, for those of us who are experiencing them.

If the child chooses his/her own<br/>\nexplorations than that is the beginning (not that it Always in every<br/>\ncircumstance has to be), thus the child-led and then the guiding from<br/>\nthe parent if needed can come into play.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren are always choosing their own explorations.  Parents are the<br/>\nones who either help or hinder that process.  Unschooling parents should<br/>\nbe helping in that process, not sitting back and watching it happen, but<br/>\nactively participating on all levels.  A parent shouldn&#39;t always wait<br/>\nfor their kid to ask for something, a parent can observe and be actively<br/>\ninvolved to varying degrees, and see where things can be expanded and<br/>\nthrow it out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nA child might not have thought to add little animals to the legos, but a<br/>\nparent can certainly enhance the play by doing so.  Or for older kids,<br/>\nlike my daughter, 14, never would have thought there were underage<br/>\nnightclubs, unless I had told her and showed her and found all the<br/>\ninformation, because she was/is interested in the 80&#39;s club scene and<br/>\ncurious to know if such things still existed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe actual phrasing is really what I was talking about though and what<br/>\nit implies.  &quot;Child-led&quot; leaves the parent out.  It doesn&#39;t say &quot;parent<br/>\nand child-led&quot; or &quot;child-leading-parent&quot; or any other thing with the<br/>\nword parent in there.  Even more so, it implies that the child is the<br/>\ncenter and everything and everyone else evolves around that.  That<br/>\nsimply isn&#39;t how it has come to play out in our house.  We are a family<br/>\nwhere our children are certainly coming first in lots of ways, and<br/>\ndefinitely we center ourselves around our children, but not because they<br/>\nare leading, but because they are equal members in the household.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore traditional parenting dismisses children outright in their role in<br/>\nthe family, they are small and unheard.  The parents lead, the opposite<br/>\nwould be the child leading and that very much gives the wrong impression<br/>\nof what actually happens in an unschooling household where everyone<br/>\nworks together, and those younger are relying on those that are older<br/>\nand have more experience.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny C","from":"&quot;Jenny C&quot; &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: leading... was child led learning","postDate":"1213555769","msgId":35375,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGczM283cCs1MmFvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDA5OENCRkU0LUIyNDktNDUwQS04RDhBLTYyODY2MDc4NDU1NEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":35369,"nextInTopic":35377,"prevInTime":35374,"nextInTime":35376,"topicId":35348,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
