The Waldorf method/philosophy strongly discourages technology of any sort: TV, movies, video games, computers, etc. So five of the families that we regularly associated with became very uncomfortable with exposing their children to &quot;screens&quot;.<div><br></div><div>Our house had always been a favorite place for playdates and initially, in an effort to maintain our relationships with these families, I was having my kids turn off, put away, or sometimes even hide, their iPads/computers/gaming platforms while their friends were visiting. Their friend&#39;s parents were clearly uncomfortable with (and judgmental) of my children&#39;s unlimited access, partly out of genuine concern for how my choices would affect my children, but also because it made it hard for them when their kids would ask why my kids could have screens and they couldn&#39;t.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So, it seemed easier at the time to just put the screens away.&nbsp;<span style=\"word-spacing:normal;line-height:1.25;\">I would give my kids the option of either turning off their screens, or not having a playdate. In the beginning, they usually opted for the playdate.</span></div><div><br></div><div>This quickly became stressful for everybody concerned -- stressful for ME, because I was having to be constantly checking to make sure the visiting kids weren&#39;t &quot;exposed&quot; to screens...stressful for MY KIDS, because they LIKED to play on screens and wanted to share what they enjoyed with their friends...and stressful for the VISITING KIDS, because, for the most part, they were really interested in playing on screens but weren&#39;t allowed to.</div><div><br></div><div>The big shift happened one day while I was having the discussion (again!) with my kids about why some people think screens are bad and why we have to turn them off when those people come over.<span style=\"word-spacing:normal;line-height:1.25;\">&nbsp;Suddenly, I realized that, by asking my kids to hide their iPads, I was sending a potentially damaging message. Basically, what they were learning, through my attempts to placate our visitors, was that the very thing that they/we loved to do the most was unacceptable to others and needed to be hidden (and/or only done in private when others weren&#39;t around). I was encouraging them to hide their love of computer games...to wait and do it when nobody else was looking. Yikes! How would a young child interpret that message?</span></div><div><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;line-height:1.25;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;line-height:1.25;\">I decided that day to stand behind my choice to allow my kids access to technology. I feel good about that choice and I am not ashamed...and I don&#39;t want my kids to feel ashamed either. So I told the other families that their kids were still welcome to come over, but that our family supports technology and our screens will be on when their kids are here! I can&#39;t begin to describe the relief!&nbsp;</span><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;line-height:1.25;\">It put a strain on my relationship with some of the parents for a while, and perhaps we didn&#39;t have as many visitors that summer as we used to, but we all feel good about ourselves and our choices.</span></div><div><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;line-height:1.25;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;line-height:1.25;\">Now, two years later, I can tell you that of those five Waldorf families...one has converted to the homeschooling/gaming lifestyle, two of them let their kids use technology at our house (and a limited amount at their own house), one moved away, and one we see less frequently, either at THEIR house or at a park or public venue.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;line-height:1.25;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;line-height:1.25;\">Anyway, hope that helps...</span></div><div><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;line-height:1.25;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;line-height:1.25;\">Amy Edwards</span></div><div><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;line-height:1.25;\"><br></span></div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Home schooled guests who have strict limitations in their own homes coming to our joyously peaceful unschooled home","postDate":"1441721399","msgId":76159,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxRTBGNUVFLTk1RUQtNDEwNS1CN0I2LTRFRkE1Q0UzMEVDOUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDk4NjBGNTk1LUIwNzctNDEzOS1BRTAxLThGRjdGOUIxNzZDRkBtYWMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDJ2Z2x0MXNvdjFiMXFnNndpOTM1dnMyci4xNDQxNjYyMDk4MDI0QGVtYWlsLmFuZHJvaWQuY29tPiA8OTg2MEY1OTUtQjA3Ny00MTM5LUFFMDEtOEZGN0Y5QjE3NkNGQG1hYy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":76158,"nextInTopic":76164,"prevInTime":76158,"nextInTime":76160,"topicId":76153,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- one day the mother took me aside and said she was disturbed because her son had mentioned he d seen my daughter s ipod in her room.

That was us being kind, not following their rules.  When Christian unschoolers came over we played innocuous kid-music instead of music with language they would object to, but you just can&#39;t always know.  Good friends of Holly&#39;s, two children of friends of the family, were riding with me and Holly in the car one day, and we had a homemade collection of harmony stuff—girl groups and doo-wop.  &quot;Under the Boardwalk&quot; came on, and the eight year old girl covered the ears of her six year old brother.

My children had friends who would come to play from time to time and the parents had asked us to not use the computers or play video games or watch dvds.   We agreed.   Even after two years of the mother and her sons coming to our house all together, and seeing how we respected their rules, one day the mother took me aside and said she was disturbed because her son had mentioned he&#39;d seen my daughter&#39;s ipod in her room.

When we discussed it my girls both decided that actually they hadn&#39;t really enjoyed the visits  for quite a while (the boys had other troubles) and would rather try meeting in an outside, neutral space to play.  Soon after we stopped seeing that family altogether.  When we did stop, I realised what a huge relief it was for me to not have to see the mother again ... Each time we&#39;d met she&#39;d ask about unschooling, asking why I wasn&#39;t worried about this and that, didn&#39;t the girls use their computers too much? etc etc.  I&#39;d respond to these questions each time, but it wasn&#39;t until they stopped altogether that I realised what a strain it had been for all of us.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI would discuss it with your children.  It&#39;s a good opportunity to talk about how some other families operate.
