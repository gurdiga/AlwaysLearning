That was the best place for toys.   <br/>\nThey had one side of an aisle.  That store was called J.W.

Doesn&#39;t specify what kind of violence or  <br/>\nin what part of the world.  Just states plainly as fact, no data, no  <br/>\nreference, Violence has increased 720%.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think that increase is domestic violence.  That seems to have  <br/>\nbeen much worse at least where I am before it was so illegal.  I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t think it was violent executions.  Those have become clinical  <br/>\nfor the most part.  It&#39;s not violence to kids in public school,  <br/>\nbecause very few places will allow swats anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe he means violence on TV, but if so it&#39;s probably an absolute  <br/>\nnumber of instances per week or something, without allowing for there  <br/>\nbeing hundreds of channels instead of three or four.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen something can&#39;t be made to mean something, it just means  <br/>\nnothing.

There were certainly toys made before  <br/>\nthat time, and even in factories.  Is anyone here a history-of-toys  <br/>\nbuff and know where that statement might have come from?

In their minds, children become  <br/>\none with the toy, interacting with it and assuming the properties of  <br/>\nit. If the toy is a figure, the child imagines that he possesses all  <br/>\nthe powers and abilities of the figure. If the toy is a Western gun  <br/>\nset, the child imagines himself as being a cowboy or gunfighter. If  <br/>\nthe toy is a spaceship, the child imagines he is the captain of the  <br/>\nship, and assumes all the characteristics of the captain-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nToys are evil, to this guy.  Papa Smurf is a White Witchdoctor.  My  <br/>\nLittle Pony displays a Satanic phenomenon:  they fly.  And (claims  <br/>\nthis guy) the popularization of unicorns came about because of My  <br/>\nLittle Pony.  That is incorrect.  I had friends (good Mormon girls in  <br/>\nSLC) collecting unicorns in the late 1970s.  Daniel 8: 4-5 is  <br/>\nsupposed to describe a unicorn, something about the Anti-Christ.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t know the Castle Greyskull was demon possessed.
