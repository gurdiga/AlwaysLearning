For a long \ntime I felt like a failure in that area because there is so much pressure to \nread to your kids but mine hated sitting still &amp; being read to!&nbsp; In the \nend it didn&#39;t matter - they enjoy stories and reading, under their own \nterms.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>She would have been a big fan of the hugs and kisses though!&nbsp;

I may have stayed until they fell asleep or \ncrept out for awhile once they were all settled, but I would have gotten up for \nawhile to spend some time with my husband.&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually, by the time \nmy&nbsp;husband and I were ready for bed they&#39;d be asleep.&nbsp; We&#39;d&nbsp;move \nthem into their own, make shift beds in our room and watched a show of our own \nfor awhile before falling asleep.&nbsp; Bed time was based on signs of readiness \nfrom the kids, not from the clock.&nbsp; Usually they&#39;d want to go get settled \nin because it was nice and they enjoyed it.&nbsp; If one or both wanted to stay \nup with us that was fine.&nbsp; If one was still up (rare) when we came to bed \nthat one would watch TV with us for awhile before falling asleep.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>This is what worked for us.&nbsp;

I went to bed with my kids. Still do, although they sleep in a different room. I am happy to go to bed at 830 or 9 (or whenever we are tired together). If I weren&#39;t, I would probably get a book light, or some podcasts or audio books, and read or listen once the kids were asleep. At this point, they like to go to bed after I do, so I just bring whatever I want to do into the bed-books, homework, etc. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As long as you are lying there waiting to leave, she is going to work to hold you there. Once you are there fully, intentionally, without an agenda, she will sleep. Humans need to feel safe and secure to sleep well.

Then try to listen to your thoughts as they’re forming, and see wheher you’re casting your relationship with your child as “struggle,” or her relationship with her own biology as “fighting.”<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo things to read, about negative words that lead away from peace, and stories of sleep and sleeping.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou wrote -=-I have been implementing more peaceful practices into our home.
