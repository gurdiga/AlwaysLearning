Get your husband in on it too.  Maybe put a dollar in a jar if either of you says &quot;learn&quot; or &quot;learning,&quot; especially about the kids.   If you THINK &quot;learning,&quot; chuck a quarter in the jar. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably by summer you won&#39;t be saying &quot;learning&quot; anymore, and you might have enough in the jar to get to the ALL Unschooling Symposium in Albuquerque in late December. :-)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://allunschooling2012.blogspot.com/\">http://allunschooling2012.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI will have company  a couple of times in the time frame you asked about.

I have two sons, 12 and 9.   I will be in Santa Fe, New Mexico moving contents out of the rental house my parents are selling.  We will be driving from Eureka, Missouri. I am interested in finding out if Sandra will be speaking in the area anytime between Jan. 18 and Feb. 1. I am so inspired by Always Learning.  We have had an eclectic approach to homeschooling and the older they get the more things are breaking down.  The word &quot;learning&quot; now has a negative connotation and I am so sad about this.  I need help in this process of transition.  So, I thought hearing Sandra speak in person and perhaps to have the opportunity to meet with her while I was in New Mexico, would be wonderful.<br/>\nIf there are any families in the St. Louis area who would like to get together that would be great too.<br/>\nThanks for any advice!<br/>\nCordelia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65019,"nextTopicId":65003}}
