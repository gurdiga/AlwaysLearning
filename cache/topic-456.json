But there is that urge in me, that <br/>\nI feel like I agree with something and therefor I should go and do it.  <br/>\nAnd then I want to go somewhere and be told that its ok not to change <br/>\nright away, all at once (I could just go read Sandra&#39;s page on taking it <br/>\nslow each time I feel that way :)<br/>\n<br/>\n---The specialty of this list is probably clarity.---<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is why I like this list best so far.  But sometimes, the clarity is <br/>\ntiring, because the more I think through ideas, the more I feel negative <br/>\nabout not being ready to follow through on them.  I know - Don&#39;t try to <br/>\ndo it ALL at once.  But still... everything I understand makes me want <br/>\nto do more, let go of more fears, trust more, enjoy more... but as I <br/>\nhave been doing that, the past several months, I encounter situations <br/>\nwhere I don&#39;t know what to do. Often the advice here, when it comes to <br/>\ndifficulties, is to anticipate needs before they become overwhelming - <br/>\navoiding conflict before it occurs.  But I am encountering times where <br/>\nit just seems impossible to anticipate conflict - when something a 3.5 <br/>\nyo likes one day, they hate the next.  Its just not possible to <br/>\nanticipate every need, or intervene before every conflict.  There are so <br/>\nmany little incidents that end up in big tantrums or crying, and I just <br/>\ndon&#39;t know what to do in the moment, while striving to better anticipate <br/>\nneeds ahead of time in general.  In general I slow things down, wait for <br/>\nher to be ready to leave, give lots of reminders about where we are <br/>\ngoing next, what is happening that day... I do those things because they <br/>\nseem to work well for her, and yet sometimes they just don&#39;t.  Is this <br/>\njust a reality of the ages I&#39;m living with?  Tantrums when wants can&#39;t <br/>\nbe fulfilled at the exact moment?  There are some situations where I <br/>\nthink maybe I should just be firm and have firm barriers, such as it <br/>\nhurts me to have Temima climb over me in certain ways.  In most weather, <br/>\nTemima can choose how to dress, but in frostbite weather, I insist on <br/>\nthe right layers, or we don&#39;t go out. <br/>\n<br/>\n---We&#39;ve met several unschooling families locally that unschool without <br/>\nTV.  Chamille didn&#39;t have much in common with their kids because of it.  <br/>\nThe kids were nice enough and the parents were nice enough too.  They <br/>\ndidn&#39;t see any harm in disallowing TV.  The parents seemed to have <br/>\ndecent relationships with their kids.  To me, it seemed snobbish and <br/>\nunnecessary.  I totally get the arguments against TV, I grew up without <br/>\none, I chose not to do that.  My sister is more an anti-TV person.  They <br/>\nhave one, but watch very limited things on it and their kids have to ask <br/>\npermission to use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nA family can live a full life without a TV and have decent relationships <br/>\nwith their children.  I don&#39;t see any benefit in keeping TV out of our <br/>\nlives, so why would I do that, especially since I see the opposite to be <br/>\ntrue.  Limiting the world creates limitations.  Most unschooling <br/>\nfamilies &quot;get&quot; that.  Some people have a hard time with their own <br/>\nhang-ups and want their lives based on their own comforts, and still <br/>\nunschool.  It just doesn&#39;t look or feel the same.---<br/>\n<br/>\nYour language leads me to think that when you meet unschooling kids who <br/>\ndo have TV, they are much nicer than these &#39;nice enough&#39; kids, and that <br/>\nthey have a phenomenal relationship with their parents, rather than a <br/>\ndecent one.  Are there different levels of &#39;full&#39; lives?  Do you mean <br/>\nthat their lives are full, but not as full as yours?  What if they have <br/>\ntons of something else that your family doesn&#39;t get?  Bible, for <br/>\ninstance (as the only other example of something that some see value and <br/>\nsome don&#39;t that I can think of tonight).  People see value, and have it <br/>\naround, or don&#39;t see value and don&#39;t have it around.  Is one family more <br/>\n&#39;full&#39; than the other, for having it (or not) around?  If you see <br/>\nbenefit to having TV and detriment to avoiding it, then for sure it <br/>\nmakes sense for you to have one.  But by that logic, and if you get the <br/>\narguments against TV, and those parents see having it as detrimental, <br/>\nand not having it as having many benefits, are they making a less worthy <br/>\ndecision?  Because by saying that it seems snobbish and unnecessary, it <br/>\nsounds like its less worthy of a choice.  I don&#39;t really agree with <br/>\nthem, but I&#39;m missing something in your statements, I think.  If you are <br/>\nallowing TV because of the benefits of it, but also because it wasn&#39;t <br/>\nallowed when you were growing up and you didn&#39;t like that, aren&#39;t you <br/>\nalso allowing your hang-ups affect you?  If they are disallowing TV <br/>\nbecause of the benefits of that, and it was allowed when they were <br/>\ngrowing up and they came to see it had negative impacts on them, isn&#39;t <br/>\nthat the same choice you made, but in reverse? <br/>\n<br/>\nCouldn&#39;t the arguments against avoiding TV be applied to so many other <br/>\nthings, like religious texts?  Someone could say they aren&#39;t avoiding, <br/>\nbut just don&#39;t have an interest and don&#39;t have it around, about either <br/>\nof those.  But TV is a great resource for exploring the world, and some <br/>\nwould argue that religious texts, or maybe Shakespeare, or something, <br/>\nare also great resources for exploring the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- The difference is that I see myself as my children&#39;s partner.  My <br/>\nsister doesn&#39;t view her kids that way.  She is very clear that the <br/>\nparents are the authority figures and the children must be treated <br/>\nkindly, but they must comply. ---<br/>\n<br/>\nThis idea of being our children&#39;s partner, I&#39;d like to discuss it.  I&#39;ve <br/>\nencountered parents who describe two ways of parenting, authoritative or <br/>\nbeing their children&#39;s friend.  Neither seem very healthy to me.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to be the &#39;boss&#39;.  But I also see what I do, and even how <br/>\nunschooling is, as so different from being a &#39;friend&#39;.  Is &#39;partner&#39; <br/>\ndifferent than friend?<br/>\n<br/>\n--- The parents&#39; own comforts were more important. ---<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m having some problems balancing when it comes to this idea.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink my own comforts or needs are more important than my children&#39;s... <br/>\nbut I do think they ARE important.  For example, when Temima, 3.5yo, is <br/>\ntrying to climb all over me, and sometimes it hurts and I ask her to <br/>\nstop, and have to physically move her off of me.  I would rather say to <br/>\nher that she can&#39;t climb on me anymore, since it most often hurts me.  <br/>\nThat would result in her getting very upset.  Where is the balance?  In <br/>\nmy striving to understand saying &#39;yes&#39; and giving more choice and <br/>\nenjoying together, I&#39;ve gotten lost.  Now that I&#39;ve started opening more <br/>\nopportunities for play and life together, there are some areas where <br/>\nthere seems to be less peace, not more.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":222835102,"authorName":"lalow66","from":"&quot;lalow66&quot; &lt;lalow@...&gt;","profile":"lalow66","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Allowances","postDate":"1266852426","msgId":51015,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhsdTdvYSt2azloQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDRCODA3MTAxLjYwNzAwMDNAeWFob28uY2E+"},"prevInTopic":51004,"nextInTopic":51061,"prevInTime":51014,"nextInTime":51016,"topicId":456,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"we give each of our kids a dollar per age per month. so my 8 year old gets 8 dollars per month and we tack onto that any extra money he earns...like for a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1762146555\">we give each of our kids a dollar per age per month. so my 8 year old gets 8 dollars per month and we tack onto that any extra money he earns...like for a while I was giving him an extra dollar a month for helping his little brother get into his carseat and buckle up.

Not sure what<br/>\nyou&#39;re after with a statement like that.---<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Pam clarified what I was thinking, or questioning.  I&#39;m wasn&#39;t <br/>\ntalking about changing the webpage, and I wasn&#39;t trying to say that a <br/>\nfamily with chores can&#39;t be unschooling.  I was/am somewhat confused, <br/>\nstill, about unschooling, radical unschooling, and this list.  When <br/>\nparents write in questions about chores, for example, they are <br/>\nquestioned a lot to reflect on whether chores are good or bad for the <br/>\nrelationships in their family, and lots of conversation happens about <br/>\nwhy they desire children to do chores and such (talking from general <br/>\nmemory here, not about any specific discussion or even specifically <br/>\nabout chores... this is bedtimes, TV, &#39;junk&#39; food, etc).   There is a <br/>\nlot of talk of saying yes, living in the moment, creating more <br/>\nopportunity for choices, finding the joy, cherishing time together, etc <br/>\n(principles).   Also, sometimes when someone refers to &quot;radical <br/>\nunschooling,&quot; or RU, Sandra asks them to just call it unschooling.  So, <br/>\nthe responses to those asking about those hot topics sound like radical <br/>\nunschooling, as Pam described, applying the principles to everything, <br/>\nnot just schooly subjects, and yet Pam wrote that she is very careful, <br/>\nand cares a lot, that nobody who is unschooling but has <br/>\nchores/bedtimes/no TV/etc. should be made to feel that they are not <br/>\nunschoolers (because they are!  I agree with that).  I understand that <br/>\nthis list doesn&#39;t serve the purpose of telling individuals that their <br/>\nchoices in unschooling are right or wrong.  I think I understand, but <br/>\nmight be wrong, that the assumption is that if a person is asking about <br/>\nchores/bedtimes/TV/etc., then they are asking for ways to change, <br/>\nbecause if they were ok with those things and those things were working <br/>\nin their relationships, they wouldn&#39;t be asking at all.  And it seems to <br/>\nme that there can&#39;t be any particular line between unschoolers and <br/>\nradical unschoolers, because there are most definitely families at every <br/>\npoint in between.   I&#39;m trying to think before I write, and not write in <br/>\na stream-of-thought way, so I will stop writing now, because I am not <br/>\nsure exactly where I am going with this, what my question is in <br/>\nparticular.  Hopefully what I wrote will trigger a response that helps <br/>\nme clarify what I&#39;m trying to get at.<br/>\n<br/>\n---I think having or not having chores, has little to do with <br/>\nunschooling, just like there are people who unschool and don&#39;t have TV, <br/>\nthere are people who unschool and have chores. The focus is more about <br/>\nthe relationship. If requiring chores isn&#39;t negatively impacting the <br/>\nrelationship, then unschooling can still flourish. If it IS negatively <br/>\nimpacting the relationship, then it&#39;s definitely something to reconsider <br/>\nand perhaps eliminate.---<br/>\n<br/>\nOk.  So here it is again.  Some unschool, and don&#39;t have TV.  Some <br/>\nunschool, and have chores.  But lots of discussion goes on here about <br/>\nkeeping TV away as a big limitation to learning, that it is a great <br/>\nresource, that children are discerning, that children understand what is <br/>\nreality and what is not, that we should be there with them watching, <br/>\netc.  So, are those that don&#39;t have a TV not Radical Unschoolers?  I&#39;m <br/>\nnot trying to imply an &#39;in-crowd&#39; as Pam called it, or better or worse, <br/>\nor higher or lower level, unschooling.  Not at all.  Can you be a <br/>\nradical unschooler but have bedtimes, no TV, chores, food limitations?  <br/>\nAre there definitions of these sorts, or is that not useful to <br/>\nunschooling at all?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn what scenario would requiring chores not impact the relationship <br/>\nnegatively?  In my head that would look like a child who just doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmind being responsible for whatever chore and never objects to it... <br/>\nwhich would be ok.  Do children like that exist?  If the parents assign <br/>\nchores but the children refuse, and the parents don&#39;t insist/force, then <br/>\nthat is that really &#39;requiring chores&#39;?  If a family got together and <br/>\ntalked about what each member prefers in terms of cleaning and such and <br/>\nthen talked about who might like to do what and everyone agreed they <br/>\nwanted to do something and they created a schedule of some sort... that <br/>\nmight be such a scenario, except the parents aren&#39;t &#39;requiring chores&#39;, <br/>\nthe family is just deciding what they want their home to look like.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to end here, as I&#39;m coming around in circles with nothing more <br/>\n&#39;to the point&#39; to ask to make this clearer.<br/>\n<br/>\nShira</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Allowances","postDate":"1266789102","msgId":50988,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkzMzZFREM1LTI4QzktNEI0Mi1CRTE0LUU0QTUzMjQzRDdBMkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDUxMzgyMC40MzQ4NS5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDQubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDk2MDQzOS40NDI5OS5xbUB3ZWI2NTYxMS5tYWlsLmFjNC55YWhvby5jb20+IDw1NUYyNUM2NzVFQUI0MDlBQTkyNTYzQUNFRDY2NDE3NEBiaWdzdXJwcmlzZT4gPEU3MTE0RThGLUEwMDktNDhDMS1BQTlGLUYzNEVBMzFENEM5RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDUxMzgyMC40MzQ4NS5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDQubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":50983,"nextInTopic":50999,"prevInTime":50987,"nextInTime":50989,"topicId":456,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Chamille has never, not one single time taken money from me or her dad, she has never spent money on something other than what she got money for.

She used to go to  <br/>\ncasinos for fun, but because Marty wasn&#39;t 21, she didn&#39;t for most of a  <br/>\nyear!  But she persuaded him to celebrate his birthday on the strip in  <br/>\nLas Vegas.  Three other friends went with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a gift, Keith and I gave him $200 cash.  Kirby (I found out later)  <br/>\ndid the same thing.  Kirby had been invited but didn&#39;t want to go,  <br/>\neven though he was in New Mexico for a conference in Santa Fe.  But he  <br/>\ngave Marty $200.  That&#39;s a pretty generous gift for a non-gambling 23  <br/>\nyear old to give his newly-21-year-old brother.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty budgetted that money and some he already had by the day, however  <br/>\nmuch to spend on food and rides and to gamble each day.  He never  <br/>\nborrowed from his next day&#39;s allotment.  Not only that, he came back  <br/>\nwith his last day&#39;s amount.  So on one hand, he used up almost all his  <br/>\nmoney.  It wasn&#39;t &quot;squandered,&quot; though, because it was earmarked for  <br/>\nLas Vegas from the beginning.   It was a birthday bash, and as such it  <br/>\nwas by all accounts very successful!  And he came back, having saved  <br/>\nsome of the money.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t say that&#39;s any intended or direct result of unschooling, and  <br/>\npartly it&#39;s a genetic money-obsession of sorts that runs in Keith&#39;s  <br/>\nfamily (and is like a disease with one of his brothers).

Usually $15-20 for our oldest and $5-10 for the younger depending on what we have and what we can afford.  When they were getting a regular allowance, Chamille got $15 directly deposited into her account and Margaux got $5 in hand, and then we&#39;d generally give them a $5 bill if they were going out somewhere, so it was on top of their allowance, but money we budgeted to have available. <br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of our girls have saved and spent their money.

She doesn&#39;t have the mentality to<br/>\nthink of taking advantage of it - she just wouldn&#39;t even think of doing<br/>\nthat. She&#39;s careful with money. When she spent a semester in France, she had<br/>\na credit card and debit card and I still had to encourage her to spend some<br/>\nmoney on buying things. She needed a better pair of shoes  - walking a LOT -<br/>\nand also saw some shoes she thought were really just very pretty. She bought<br/>\nthe practical ones, but I had to remind her and support her in buying the<br/>\npretty ones because she WAS in PARIS for goodness&#39; sake and buying a pretty<br/>\npair of shoes in a Paris shop was a cool thing to do. They weren&#39;t super<br/>\nexpensive or anything, but she didn&#39;t really &quot;need&quot; them and was aware that<br/>\nthe whole trip had cost us a lot and was trying to be super super careful<br/>\nwith spending money there. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRosie and Roya both had jobs really young and had their own money so we got<br/>\nthem debit cards. Roya got a credit card when she turned 18, based on her<br/>\nemployment history. When Rosie wanted to get one, about a year ago, after<br/>\nshe turned 18, we thought she could get it on her own, too, but her job paid<br/>\ncash under-the-table and so they didn&#39;t count her as being employed. We put<br/>\n$500 into an account and they gave her a credit card with a $500 limit. Then<br/>\nshe told her employer she wanted to be paid legally and a year has gone by<br/>\nso now she can ask to have the credit card sort of disconnected from that<br/>\n$500 that has been sitting in the related account. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Allowances","postDate":"1266782000","msgId":50975,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkzMzE1OC41Nzc3Ny5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDcubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhscG04bytqYmU2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhscG04bytqYmU2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":50972,"nextInTopic":50978,"prevInTime":50974,"nextInTime":50976,"topicId":456,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***When we got in the car he said he had left his money at home cause he was saving up for a Birthday present for his sister and didnt want to use it.

Requiring children to do chores<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be unschooling.-=-&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some things that are clearly &quot;schooling.&quot; If you make your child<br/>\ndo math worksheets every day, that is schooling. If you require a child to<br/>\nread for 15 minutes every day, that is schooling. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nFor some people, when they are unschooling, they get to really thinking<br/>\nabout how it is working and why it works so well and, as they more and more<br/>\ndeeply understand how children really learn, it makes sense that it isn&#39;t<br/>\njust reading and writing and &#39;rithmetic that is best learned in unschoolish<br/>\nways, but everything else, too. So then we have an extension of what started<br/>\nout as unschooling to something that is often called radical unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo asking the question of whether requiring children to do chores is really<br/>\nunschooling is not going to get a yes or no answer. The answer is - of<br/>\ncourse people who require chores can still be unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBut another answer is that really taking a deep look at unschooling<br/>\nprinciples and applying them to learning to care for a home and the things<br/>\nin a home will probably mean dropping chore requirements just like you<br/>\ndropped math and reading requirements. Or maybe not - maybe that aspect of<br/>\nunschooling won&#39;t become apparent to you. I know a lot of people who<br/>\nunschool and don&#39;t allow television and do have chores. I wouldn&#39;t not say<br/>\nthey are not unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThis whole radical unschooling approach is still developing. Those of us who<br/>\nstarted unschooling 15 years ago, or more, didn&#39;t have these ideas being<br/>\npresented to us. When Mary Griffith was writing, &quot;The Unschooling Handbook,&quot;<br/>\nin the mid-1990s, these ideas were not much out there, being talked about as<br/>\nif they were part of unschooling. The subtitle of her book is, &quot;Using the<br/>\nWhole World as Your Child&#39;s Classroom.&quot; The emphasis is clearly on learning<br/>\nschool-subject type of stuff in better-than-school kinds of ways.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMany long-time unschoolers, some among the pioneers of unschooling, would<br/>\nthink radical unschooling is going too far. I&#39;ve heard them call it<br/>\n&quot;unparenting.&quot; They don&#39;t get it and can&#39;t really imagine how it works.  I<br/>\nwould never want to say they weren&#39;t unschooling just because they didn&#39;t<br/>\nextend unschooling as far as some of us are doing, these days. I do think<br/>\nall of what we&#39;re supporting and promoting was inherent in what John Holt<br/>\nwrote and that it springs from the same principles - applies to learning in<br/>\ngeneral, not just academics. I mean, even John Holt wrote about bedtimes, so<br/>\nhe saw that part of it. And he was clearly on the road of taking his ideas<br/>\nvery far - but those who were homeschooling at the same time he was alive<br/>\nand doing his writing were not necessarily on the same trajectory that he<br/>\nwas. Many of them combined free school ideas (Summerhill) with John Holt&#39;s<br/>\nideas along with suspicion of mass media, big corporations, agribusiness,<br/>\nand politicians. It was part of being &quot;anti-establishment&quot; for them, as much<br/>\nas a new style of parenting. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, even today, I don&#39;t like it that unschoolers who still have more<br/>\nconventional parenting styles would be told or made to feel that they aren&#39;t<br/>\nreal unschoolers. I want to be able to talk about extending unschooling to<br/>\nall kinds of learning, to all aspects of life, without feeling like I am<br/>\nturning people away from unschooling because they feel like they&#39;re being<br/>\nexcluded from some kind of in-group. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279647515,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"&quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;d.lewis@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Allowances","postDate":"1266777932","msgId":50970,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE2Q0RFREZFMjE0QzRENjQ4MUJENTBBOTcwRjk2NThDQGJpZ3N1cnByaXNlPg==","referencesHeader":"PDk2MDQzOS40NDI5OS5xbUB3ZWI2NTYxMS5tYWlsLmFjNC55YWhvby5jb20+IDw1NUYyNUM2NzVFQUI0MDlBQTkyNTYzQUNFRDY2NDE3NEBiaWdzdXJwcmlzZT4gPEU3MTE0RThGLUEwMDktNDhDMS1BQTlGLUYzNEVBMzFENEM5RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":50966,"nextInTopic":50972,"prevInTime":50969,"nextInTime":50971,"topicId":456,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***I think most mainstream parents would assume you re wrong, or a liar.*** It turns out I am a liar, but only about the dates.

We went according to our needs.   A couple different times in Dylan&#39;s life we were going more frequently when we were taking Dylan&#39;s grandfather to his cancer treatments. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Dylan wanted his own money we thought about what he&#39;d likely want to buy with it and how often he&#39;d get a chance to use it and we gave him money enough for that.

All in all, he&#39;s really good with his money, and that&#39;s absolutely come from the trial and error of having his own money to spend. <br/>\n <br/>\nHe sometimes asks about doing things around here to earn a little extra money, but we honestly just don&#39;t often have &quot;extra&quot; stuff that needs to be done. When he&#39;s tall enough to push the mower, if he wants to earn money by mowing, he can do that -- that&#39;s a job we&#39;d hire out if neither hubby nor I had the time (or inclination) to do it. In the fall when all the leaves have fallen, if kiddo&#39;s looking to earn some bucks, I&#39;ll offer to pay him if he wants to help me rake and pick up leaves -- sometimes he does, sometimes he doesn&#39;t (but I actually enjoy doing it, so it&#39;s no sweat off my nose if he&#39;s not interested). I would pay him to wash the cars or the dogs if he wanted to do that -- those are also things we pay to have done.  <br/>\n <br/>\n---About families giving kids allowance but requiring them to put some in <br/>\nsavings or in the offering plate at church, it seems to me more about <br/>\ncontrol than learning, on the surface at least. Why not on allowance <br/>\nday (a month is a LONG long time for a little kid to wait) the parents <br/>\nwho want some money to go into savings just do that then? Give the <br/>\nkid $10 or whatever and tell him you also put $5 in savings or <br/>\nwhatever it is?---<br/>\n <br/>\nI agree. In my opinion, an allowance should be a gift and not be given with strings. My mom gives each of us grown children cash on our birthdays and we&#39;re not told that part needs to go into savings (or, if we were churchgoers, that part would go into the collection plate) -- it&#39;s given as a gift and we spend it however we wish. That&#39;s how I treat allowances.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf parents want kids to put $$$ into the collection plate, they could add that amount to their allowance and designate it as collection plate money. (In other words, build *up* their allowance to offset that amount.) Or, what my parents did when we were churchgoers was they&#39;d hand each of us a buck before the service began and then we put that into the collection plate -- if we were churchgoers this is the option I&#39;d choose.<br/>\n <br/>\nI agree with Sandra about savings account money. If a parent is insistent money be saved in a child&#39;s behalf, the parents should put it into savings and not have it be carved out of the allowance. I think it should be handled as a gift, and, as with an allowance, not have strings attached re: how it&#39;s spent. If a child wants to open a savings account and put part or all of their allowance into it, I&#39;d absolutely help them do that -- but that would be savings set aside at *their* wish.<br/>\n <br/>\nGlenda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":313835818,"authorName":"Dana Hayden","from":"Dana Hayden &lt;dana1095@...&gt;","profile":"qmemom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Allowances","postDate":"1266713198","msgId":50941,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg5NGM1YzljMTAwMjIwMTY0NnA1ZWJjOGVlOXU5MTk0N2U4NWE5OGE4ZDMzQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDg5NGM1YzljMTAwMjIwMTIxMXY2MjI3OTczOW8xNDg5YTRkZTJlNzMxYjA0QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDRCODAyRDhCLjMwNDAxMDdAeWFob28uY2E+CSA8ODk0YzVjOWMxMDAyMjAxMjExdjYyMjc5NzM5bzE0ODlhNGRlMmU3MzFiMDRAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":50937,"nextInTopic":50943,"prevInTime":50940,"nextInTime":50942,"topicId":456,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I should have added:  we don t attach chores to payday - it s just money; and we make the savings deposit, so they aren t handing it back.

I have allowed my kids to work for $ too, like watch the <br/>\nbaby for 15 minute for a quarter. I do not pay them for regular chores, <br/>\nthese are expected. --<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was from that page.  I would guess the part about chores being <br/>\nexpected wasn&#39;t really reflective of unschooling? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf a person does pay for chores, or babysitting the baby, does that mean <br/>\nthey will only do those things if renumerated?  I remember being that <br/>\nway with my parents... since they payed me to do some things, holding my <br/>\nallowances against my chores... eventually I started asking to be paid <br/>\nextra for any extra work done, or I refused to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout chores - parental mindset.  Should we be very careful not to <br/>\nequate giving money to someone for doing a chore to expecting them to do <br/>\nthe chore in order to be paid?  My parents paid me for some chores, but <br/>\nI HAD to do them, it wasn&#39;t something I could skip, and the payment was <br/>\na bribe, I guess, since it was a piece of my allowance.  I don&#39;t want to <br/>\ndo that. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd more about mindset and chores.  Requiring children to do chores <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be unschooling.  What is the relationship between asking <br/>\nsomeone to help you out with some chore once in a while, or even <br/>\nregularly, if they seem to want to help, and then having other chores <br/>\nwhere you offer to pay them?  Why pay for some and not all? <br/>\n<br/>\nHow about inflation?  What I got from the various $$ amounts, multiplied <br/>\nby years, was that that basic dollar amount seems to be consistently <br/>\nsimilar to the cost of a chocolate bar or a bit of candy or something <br/>\nsmall like that.  It doesn&#39;t make sense to give them so little that they <br/>\ncan&#39;t do anything with it... and children can appreciate the value of a <br/>\ncandy bar, right?  So, I&#39;d put the current basic dollar amount somewhere <br/>\naround $1.15 Canadian, most candy bars cost that much. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, about giving charity.  Judaism has a tradition that Jews should <br/>\ngive 10 percent of their income to charity, and we keep a tzedakah box <br/>\n(tin can with a slit for money that goes to charity) around.  Can we <br/>\ntell her of the tradition (she already loves to put coins in there), <br/>\nwithout being coercive or forcing it?  I&#39;d like to say to her that we <br/>\nhave such a tradition, and then since she can&#39;t do math yet, maybe take <br/>\none out of ten coins and separate them to show her how many it would <br/>\nmean, and then let her decide if she wants to put that into the box, or <br/>\nless, or more, or none.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":359707411,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"Robyn Coburn &lt;dezignarob@...&gt;","profile":"designarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Allowances","postDate":"1266707412","msgId":50936,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlhYzYyNmNjMTAwMjIwMTUxMHMxMjFkODcyN28xZDY3OWZkYWM5N2U3ZDNhQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhscG04bytqYmU2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDEzNEE3NjhBLTMyNUYtNDUzNi04NUY0LTJGMENDRUMyNjU5REBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JIDxobHBtOG8ramJlNkBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":50931,"nextInTopic":50937,"prevInTime":50935,"nextInTime":50937,"topicId":456,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Jayn (10) gets no allowance, although she does earn money from her earrings sales - I think she has about $25.

She<br/>\nbecame very stressed and upset with the idea of her paying for her own toys.<br/>\nShe didn&#39;t want to be the person handing it to the cashier, but she didn&#39;t<br/>\nwant me to undertake that either. But it wasn&#39;t even as simple as that. When<br/>\nshe understood that the purpose of her allowance was for her to pay for the<br/>\ndolls from it, she just cried and cried.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe wanted me to continue to buy her dolls for her when we could afford it.<br/>\n(All our purchases have been curtailed a lot recently with the downturn in<br/>\nour finances.) She didn&#39;t want to have an allowance. She wants to ask for<br/>\ndolls, or cookies, or candy at the store and I will pay (or Daddy).<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is interested in the numbers - the comparative costs of different things<br/>\nand how the dolls compare to our other purchases like food or rent. She is<br/>\nperfectly happy to accept a dollar limit on what can be spent today. She<br/>\nunderstands the concept of a budget. But the idea of an allowance is just<br/>\ntoo much responsibility or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think she just wants to feel like we give her the things we give her. So<br/>\nas much as an allowance sounded good, for all the useful learning<br/>\nexperiences that allowances are designed to offer, it didn&#39;t work here.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for a 3.5 year old - what we used to do was compare the costs of some<br/>\nthings to the cost of familiar and valued things. For example, how a tray of<br/>\nmeat cost the same as one regular Barbie (~$10) or how the collector Barbie<br/>\nwas the same price as 10 of the regular.<br/>\nSo I buy the stuff for her as possible, and she sweetly offers us her<br/>\nsavings for our household expenses. They are kinda on paper savings, since<br/>\nher balance and mine are mixed up in my Paypal.

Now $6.75.-- From:  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/spoiled\">http://sandradodd.com/spoiled</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWas wondering how people calculate what is a good amount for an <br/>\nallowance.  I can see already, with Temima at 3.5, that she would <br/>\nbenefit from an allowance of some sort.  She has difficulty <br/>\nunderstanding when we need to spend less on spontaneous treats some <br/>\nweeks (we both enjoy Starbucks... but it adds up, and some weeks my <br/>\nhusband lets me know that we overspent a bit the previous week, and we <br/>\nration a bit better that week).  I had the idea that we could give her <br/>\nsome small change (she prefers change to bills) each week, enough for <br/>\ntwo of the things she likes to get at Starbucks (a specific sort of <br/>\ncookie), and then when we go there she can decide whether she&#39;d like to <br/>\n&#39;buy&#39; a cookie that time, and she&#39;ll see the quantity of coins becoming <br/>\nless and less (although she won&#39;t really understand the value of each <br/>\ncoin yet).  And there will be times where she runs out, and I will <br/>\ngladly help her.  And if she wants to save the money instead, I&#39;ll still <br/>\ngladly buy her cookies, within our means, just like how I am with myself <br/>\nand my treats.  I thought that doing this might help give meaning to the <br/>\nfew times when I explain that we shouldn&#39;t get any more treats that <br/>\nday/week. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I was thinking about quantity of allowances, and I wanted to know <br/>\nhow Sandra came to the 75 cents/per year of age, and what other methods <br/>\nother parents chose. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr, if this has been discussed a lot, point me to any web pages that <br/>\nwould be helpful to read.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"Julie Stauffer","from":"&quot;Julie Stauffer&quot; &lt;jnjstau@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Allowances","postDate":"1008010792","msgId":467,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMWEwMWMxODFhYyRlMjQxYjZjMCQxMWE2YjFkOEBkZWZhdWx0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwMDc5NzY4MjIuNTk4LjU4MDAyLm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":456,"nextInTopic":50922,"prevInTime":466,"nextInTime":468,"topicId":456,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We usually start the kids out about 3 years old, getting a dollar for every year.

I decided to give them 1/2 their <br/>\nage,( my way of introducing fractions) so at 3 they got $1.50 a week, at 7 <br/>\nthey get $3.50 a week. Somewhere along the way I read that money comes in <br/>\ndifferent ways, gifts, work, dividends, etc. Treat allowances like gifts, <br/>\ngiving $ just because the child is part of the family. I have allowed my <br/>\nkids to work for $ too, like watch the baby for 15 minute for a quarter. I <br/>\ndo not pay them for regular chores, these are expected. My oldest is great <br/>\nwith $. She has saved for important to her items. She treats those items <br/>\nvery well. She is now saving all her $ for a camera. She thinks at $14.00 a <br/>\nmonth she will get her camera a year or so from now. She will stay focused <br/>\non the camera, I know her. I have also slit items with her. Scooters are the <br/>\nrage here and mine do not have them. She started to save, I said we would <br/>\nsplit it.  She realized a stereo was more important to her, had saved $40.00 <br/>\nalready and we went to the store where she proudly got her item. My 5 year <br/>\nold is just starting to understand his power with money. As he unfolds I&#39;ll <br/>\nshare more stories. Oh, my 7 year old has now decided to get her money all <br/>\nat once at the end of the month. Her choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nmary (who also has 7,5,2 girl,boy,girl.
