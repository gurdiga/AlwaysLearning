(Which actually are far better at demotivating someone.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s spent 12 years or so working towards a goal (good grades,  <br/>\ncollege) that everyone said was where he needed to go to be  <br/>\nsuccessful. And that turned out to be a lie. 12 years. Pretty much  <br/>\nhis entire childhood. You can&#39;t give him that back *but* you can give  <br/>\nhim the best now you possibly can. He needs time to recover. He needs  <br/>\ntime to just be.

And  <br/>\ndeschooling isn&#39;t just on his part. You need to not nudge him in a  <br/>\ndirection you want him to go.
