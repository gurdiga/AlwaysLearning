My dad is great in many ways, and he loves us the <br/>\nbest way he knows. But as a person, and not a father, he is a great guy, but <br/>\nhe is also in many ways, a closed minded, verbally abusive, hard edged, <br/>\nbigoted, opinionated, jerk. He was very intune to problems I had at school, <br/>\nand helped me in many ways, but he was also remote, and unforgiving. I was <br/>\nvery depressed for years, I had been sexually abused, and I tried to kill <br/>\nmyself. Dad saw that (my attempted suicide, not the abuse. He has never been <br/>\ntold about that.) as a reflection on him and our family and since that time <br/>\nhas never been able to forgive me for that particular sin. And has, since <br/>\nthat time been very distant towards me, and that has extended to being <br/>\ndistant toward my kids as well. So I guess, if you needed a guy to stick up <br/>\nfor you, he is probably the best, but if you needed to be understood for <br/>\nsomething different, well then, I wouldn&#39;t send my worst enemy to him. <br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":120281009,"authorName":"cris trainor","from":"&quot;cris trainor&quot; &lt;muddpies@...&gt;","profile":"thinkspringblooms","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: public humiliation","postDate":"1030930828","msgId":9060,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERBVjE0c2NMOU50REVKbUd6ckwwMDA1MzQ2M0Bob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":9036,"nextInTopic":9068,"prevInTime":9059,"nextInTime":9061,"topicId":9036,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"nancy wrote: I was expelled from highschool for a week my sophomore year.
