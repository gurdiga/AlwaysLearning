I havent got <br/>\nto putting them back yet and she tried to help a little on her own-but <br/>\nit is really hard to get all the books back in there. I tried to <br/>\nhandle that situation in a good way. I wasnt condisending or anything <br/>\nlike that with my tone-but it really did make me sad cuase I had spent <br/>\nall that time cleaning. Does anyone have any suggestions on how I <br/>\ncouldve handled that differently?<br/>\nI went through a little burnout for about a week. It sucked but I <br/>\ntried to stay positive through it. I think I did pretty good. <br/>\nAnd my husband seems to be going through a burnout right now. But he <br/>\nworks outside (in florida) doing glass work so hes up and down ladders <br/>\nall day carrying heavy peices of glass in the hot sun.  I think that <br/>\nplays alot into it. I try to keep the house cool when he gets home so <br/>\nit is comfy here for him.<br/>\nI know this is long but I havent posted for awhile and just wanted to <br/>\npost a little something.
