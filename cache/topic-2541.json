Before I had children I thought I would<br/>\nbreastfeed anywhere and everywhere and that it would be other people&#39;s<br/>\nproblem if they didn&#39;t like it.  They didn&#39;t have to look.... When I had Max<br/>\n(my youngest)... I was breastfeeding him in my living room and my parents<br/>\ncame over (my mother and step-father)... All of a sudden I was really<br/>\nuncomfortable breast feeding in front of this man, even though I&#39;ve known<br/>\nhim 20 years and he wasn&#39;t staring.  I had to take myself off into the<br/>\nbedroom because I love of this as a bonding moment with my son that I did<br/>\nnot want to share with my family watching.  It was the strangest feeling....<br/>\nI nursed in public very rarely.... usually nursing before we went out or<br/>\nwhen we came back... I just found I was uncomfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow here&#39;s the other side of the story.... Breasts are for feeding<br/>\ninfants.... that&#39;s their primary purpose... It is man that has sexualized<br/>\nthem into being something to look at and droll over... maybe men never get<br/>\nover that mother attachment and look longingly at women to fulfil something<br/>\nthey are missing or never had...In countries such as New Zealand and<br/>\nAustrailia the average amount of time for breastfeeding is the first 3 years<br/>\nof life and you have to buy bottles from a Pharmacy as it&#39;s unusual to not<br/>\nbreastfeed.  I wonder how people look there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also found, having grown up in England, now living in America that<br/>\nthe Americans are a lot more uptight when it comes to sexual things and also<br/>\nto this breast feeding thing.
