She and the 8yo offered to cook dinner one night so I<br/>\ncould get ready to take them out to a Christmas play.  I was thrilled!!<br/>\nAfter I was ready, I came into the kitchen and 11yo basically has her eyes<br/>\nspinning in their sockets.  She says &quot;I just got a view of your life.&quot;<br/>\n(5yo, 3yo and 2yo wanted to help which quickly deteriorated into fighting<br/>\nover counterspace ending in banishment from the kitchen by the 11yo).<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think age makes such a difference for kids.  My 3yo is hell-on-wheels<br/>\nand has been since the day he learned to scoot across the floor.  But today,<br/>\nhe sang in the children&#39;s choir at church, standing tall and singing his<br/>\nheart out....no tantrums, no foot stomping.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut waiting for that self-control is a long and difficult process and the<br/>\nmore little kids you have, the harder it is.  Kid A gets mad and takes a toy<br/>\nfrom Kid B.  Kid B gets upset and kicks Kid A.  Kid A flops in the floor,<br/>\nlanding on Kid C who now is screaming and throwing stuff at both Kids A and<br/>\nB.   All this happened in the few minutes you were in the kitchen helping<br/>\nKid D try to double a recipe.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually the biggest thing I have found that works with my kids is talking<br/>\nto them about us being a team and how we have to work together and support<br/>\neach other.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":347,"nextTopicId":383}}
