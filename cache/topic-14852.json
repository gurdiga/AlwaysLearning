First The Ash Grove, for candles the tune Maddy Prior and <br/>\nJune Tabor used for &quot;The Seven Wonders&quot; on the Silly Sisters album, and for <br/>\nrecessional a ballad tune.  The words are not at all wedding-like, but few there <br/>\nknew which ballad it was.  (It&#39;s about a woman drowning a guy who tried to kill <br/>\nher for her clothes and steal her horse. &lt;g&gt;  But musically it&#39;s great. )  We <br/>\nfollowed the minister out, playing still, but stayed inside the church <br/>\nbecause had we gone outside playing, the wondrous acoustics of that little chapel <br/>\nwould have turned to the sudden thinness of playing in the great outdoors.  So <br/>\nwe used the chapel as an amplifier, even after people were outside doing the <br/>\nsword-arch thing.  It was a big adobe Renaissance boom box.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause we wear 11th century costumes &quot;in real life,&quot; we had  no snazzy 17th <br/>\ncentury stuff, but hey, we matched. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the reception later, we played a Bouree from Terpsichore by Praetorius.<br/>\nI&#39;m playing it at the homeschooling talent show in SC, too, but won&#39;t have <br/>\nKeith to harmonize off of.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14863,"nextTopicId":528}}
