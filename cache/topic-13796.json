I wish I had seen it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIan McKellan was on Saturday Night Live and did a skit in which he was a guy <br/>\nwho worked at Pizza Hut in some mid-sized American city, and who dressed like <br/>\nDr. Who with the long coat and scarf and was the greatest Dr. Who <br/>\nimpersonator in that town.  So he&#39;s being interviewed by two gaming geeks on <br/>\na local cable access show about sci-fi/gaming conventions or some such, and <br/>\nhe says he has some new impressions he&#39;s working on.  One, he says, is <br/>\nGandalf from Lord of the Rings.  And he does PERFECTLY the same the line (of <br/>\nhis own) where Gandalf says &quot;Bilbo Baggins, do not take me for some conjuror <br/>\nof cheap tricks&quot; (whatever all that is), and then goes straight back to his <br/>\nDr.-Who-impersonating-pizza-guy character.  They press him to do another, and <br/>\nhe says he will do Magneto.  So he does a Magneto line, but does it entirely <br/>\nlamely, not at all like the movie.  Marty is fully familiar with the X-Men <br/>\nstuff and he said it was hilariously wrong and UNlike the movie.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13785,"nextTopicId":13840}}
