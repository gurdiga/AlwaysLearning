Had no idea <br/>\nwhy you&#39;d call it that but figured it MUST mean something. I felt pretty dumb <br/>\nwhen I finally parsed it out correctly. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway...<br/>\n<br/>\nPatrick (14 this week) is really into video games. Loves them. Absolutely. In <br/>\naddition to owning a Game Cube, Nintendo DS, and half interest in an XBox, <br/>\nhe&#39;s trying to aquire a complete historic Nintendo hardware collection. He plays <br/>\na LOT of video games, and thinks and reads and writes about them when he&#39;s <br/>\nnot playing them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd still, it&#39;s not all he does. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the last half hour he was picking out Camptown Racers on the electronic <br/>\nkeyboard. He&#39;s been picking out songs almost every day this week. Thursday <br/>\nevening he went to the driving range with his dad, they&#39;re just about ready to <br/>\nfinally go out for a round. Every day for the last week (month, year) he&#39;s gone <br/>\nfor a bike ride, at least a mile round trip. Twice this week he was at the <br/>\nskate park working on basic skateboarding skills, as well as almost every day on <br/>\nour patio. (He&#39;s asked for a GOOD skateboard for his birthday.) Today he was <br/>\nout with friends whacking around with the foam swords he made, riding bikes, and <br/>\ngenerally running around together. This week he&#39;s been reading the most <br/>\nrecent book in the Series of Unfortunate Events, Nintendo Power, GamePro, a book <br/>\nabout fencing, and a book on WWII tanks that his fencing instructor lent him. He <br/>\njust picked up the Muse issue from March 2005 about Pompeii and took it up to <br/>\nread while asking me for what else we have around the house on the subject. <br/>\nHe was awestruck by the recent exhibit at the Field museum in Chicago from the <br/>\nexcavations of Pompeii and Herculaneum, it&#39;s taken a while to want to probe <br/>\nfurther. <br/>\n<br/>\nHis twin sister Sarah is also a gamer (one of her favorite T&#39;s reads &quot;Video <br/>\nGames are a Full Time Job&quot;). She owns the other half of that Xbox, as well as a <br/>\nPlaystation 2 and Nintendo DS. She&#39;s often found on the unschooling gamers <br/>\nlist talking about the games she loves. But it&#39;s not all of her life. Yup, she <br/>\nspent a LOT of time on the computer this week - she started a new SIMS family. <br/>\nShe also rode her bike 2 miles to the forest preserve to do some nature <br/>\nsketching. She wrote a little more for her ongoing artist encouragement series. She <br/>\nspent quite a lot of time painting. She read several more chapters in her <br/>\ncurrent fantasy novel. She spent hours and hours and HOURS on the phone with her <br/>\nbest friend who moved 1 1/2 hours away last summer. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;ve never, ever, only played video games, even on days when they had new, <br/>\nwonderful games.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd they&#39;re still pretty smart. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25810,"nextTopicId":25830}}
