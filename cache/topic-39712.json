There were two of us mothers as coaches, but we really did very little except guide the kids through the administrative steps of the process--the research, presentation, poster and T-shirts. The group decision-making needed a lot of motherly guidance, too!<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither of us understood how to do the programming, and the kids were just fine with that.

Do you have the plan for the playing field? There really is no pre-written guide to follow for solving the various challenges--the kids must invent ways to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorking through pre-designed models might be a useful way to learn the basics of how the programming and the robot work. But at some point, the kids are going to have to invent their own things.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething we learned is that the scoring depends on much more than just whether the robot succeeds in the tasks. The research project and HOW it is presented is a big factor in the point totals, as is general presentation of the whole team--poster, t-shirt, matching hair ribbons (our team was all boys and they didn&#39;t care about any of this!). <br/>\n<br/>\nEspecially important was an ability to answer questions from the judges and show an awareness of what each kid did as an individual and as part of the team. Our boys described days of research as: &quot;We went to the library a few times and got some books.&quot; The other coach-mom and I just groaned on the other side of the door! But their robot completed all the tasks, and they were happy with that. They didn&#39;t advance in the competition; when we explained to them what they&#39;d have to do to win, they weren&#39;t interested!

The children programmed the robots to perform the<br/>\ncommands within the time limit that they have and the girls actually<br/>\nwound up winning at the competition because the judges were so<br/>\nimpressed by how they worked together and encouraged one another as a<br/>\nteam. (I&#39;m getting teary-eyed remembering this). For my girls, the<br/>\nexperience was two-fold: they enjoyed the challenges of robotics, but<br/>\nthey relished the opportunity to work cooperatively with a group of<br/>\ngirls on something scientific. They never asked to do Lego League<br/>\nagain, and we are all satisfied with the memories and experience.
