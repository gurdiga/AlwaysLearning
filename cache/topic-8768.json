However, I<br/>\nreally wasn&#39;t *defining* unschooling. I&#39;m not interested in doing that. (If<br/>\nI were being asked to go speak at conferences, I guess I&#39;d have to pin that<br/>\ndown ;-)  What I was trying to say is that for me the *greater emphasis* is<br/>\non being interest-led. Now I think I would like to add, also respect. The<br/>\nscenario you presented would not be respectful at all; however, I&#39;ve seen<br/>\nparents make requirements of kids wrt learning in a way that is much more<br/>\nrespectful, cooperative and spare.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Interest is one thing, but for me unschooling is about choice: who decides<br/>\n  if to do it and when to do it and how to do it and why to do it and what<br/>\nto<br/>\n  do in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Oh, this is really helping me clarify. Choice is good. For me, I think<br/>\nrespect is the most important goal. I&#39;ll let someone else define respect.<br/>\n<br/>\n   &quot;It seems that for some people, it is also an equally important goal that<br/>\n  adults not exercise any influence over the learning process,&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen an unschooler write this, or say this, or<br/>\nimply<br/>\n  it. You can&#39;t live with another person without influencing them (and this<br/>\n  works both ways, parent to child, child to parent, or spouse to spouse for<br/>\n  that matter). What have you seen written or heard said that makes you<br/>\n  think/feel this?<br/>\n<br/>\n  An example I recently heard was a parent whose child practically implored<br/>\nthem to &quot;make her&quot; follow through with some goal or other, because the child<br/>\nknew she was likely to back down from the work when the time came, but truly<br/>\nwanted to achieve the overall goal. I can&#39;t remember what the goal was. It<br/>\nseemed to me that the parent&#39;s value of noncoercion was greater than her<br/>\ndesire to help her child learn upon request.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Perhaps &#39;influence&#39; is the wrong word. Would you agree that it is the goal<br/>\nof many unschoolers to never coerce their children in matters pertaining to<br/>\nlearning? IMO, this influence that we all have over each other is on the<br/>\nsame spectrum as coercion, and there are many shades of gray between.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I hope I don&#39;t seem to be picking on you -- it&#39;s not my intent.

I don&#39;t know why, but I just feel that the (if you want <br/>\nto call it a label) idea of unschooling has evolved to mean certain things, <br/>\nand it doesn&#39;t include coercion. <br/>\nOn another list, a lady was telling a newcomer all about her idea of <br/>\nunschooling. This included, among other things, her idea that if one of her <br/>\nchildren expressed an interest in a subject or idea, she would make <br/>\nworksheets, reading lists, and unit studies. All this was presented as a good <br/>\n&quot;child-led&quot; learning experience. I made the mistake of stating that, while I <br/>\nfelt things like unit studies and reading lists were fine, it wasn&#39;t *true* <br/>\nunschooling. And that, if they were eclectic schoolers that was fine but they <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t pass it off to others as unschooling. Big heated debate followed <br/>\n(many making statements to me that I was putting a label and restrictions on <br/>\nunschooling, that I was making it sound like a members only club) with most <br/>\ndeclaring that with unschooling, everything goes. That my way was too <br/>\nuncertain, and that what I was doing was tantamount to educational neglect. &gt;<br/>\n:(  That it was a parents duty with unschooling to see that if a child was <br/>\ninterested in something to provide said unit studies and worksheets. <br/>\nAnother view was expressed that if a child never showed an interest in a <br/>\ncertain subject and a parent felt that subject was important, then the parent <br/>\nshould make sure the child learned it as well. Cajoling allowed. I said that <br/>\nit was certainly a narrow minded view that children couldn&#39;t be trusted to <br/>\nlearn anything without boxing things into school like subjects and *making* <br/>\nthem learn.

I <br/>\n&gt;really<br/>\n&gt;think you&#39;d like it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, but I will look for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&lt;&lt; Many children and adults<br/>\n&gt;have very strong gifts and interests that they&#39;d like to pursue, but <br/>\n&gt;limited<br/>\n&gt;resources, and, even more, procrastination or laziness keep them from<br/>\n&gt;pursuing them.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In any unschooling family it&#39;s the parents&#39; part to provide opportunities <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;inspiration.  I&#39;m not really picturing what would &quot;accelerate&quot; it and still<br/>\n&gt;keep it in the realm of unschooling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My original question was where are the support groups in various states, or<br/>\n&gt;where is this written up on the internet, because I had never heard of it<br/>\n&gt;until the other day.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thus far I don&#39;t know of any formal support groups. There was a web page <br/>\nthat the Menapolits maintained, with its own message boards, but it seems to <br/>\nbe down.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&lt;&lt;Accelerated Unschooling allows the parent to take control of<br/>\n&gt;the motivation piece.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Once parents have &quot;taken control&quot; of ANY piece, how is it then still <br/>\n&gt;learning<br/>\n&gt;at one&#39;s own pace ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt;This is especially important for children who are<br/>\n&gt;Gifted or Talented, but who often lack motivation. Accelerated Unschooling<br/>\n&gt;allows them to reach their potentials.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tell me more.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt;My personal experience with Accelerated Unschooling has been particularly<br/>\n&gt;dramatic. I have fo have begun Accelerated<br/>\n&gt;Unschooling, they have excelled in all of their areas of giftedness &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What method were you using before &quot;accelerated unschooling&quot;?<br/>\n&gt;Were the children ever in school?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My older children were in school when they were tested, in different areas, <br/>\nfor giftedness. We were very unhappy with the school&#39;s response, which was <br/>\nif they&#39;re gifted, they don&#39;t need any special programming. The children <br/>\nwere bored and miserable.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe took them out of school and began traditional unschooling. We pictured <br/>\nhappy children enjoying the resources and time available to them. We didn&#39;t <br/>\npressure them, and offered flexibility and options. This went on for two <br/>\nyears.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally my two oldest children came to us in tears. Both were angry that we <br/>\nhadn&#39;t pushed them more to make use of their gifts, and demanded to go back <br/>\nto school. Both were very unhappy, and felt they had wasted time. <br/>\nCoincidentally, two days later I discovered that the workshop was happening, <br/>\nand arranged to fly to CA. (SF) I was reluctant to try the approach, because <br/>\nit just didn&#39;t seem to fit into the John Holt framework, but my children <br/>\nsaid that if we didn&#39;t try it, they wanted to go back to school -- which I <br/>\nKNEW wasn&#39;t good for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey bloomed. They started working on things that interested them, they got <br/>\nhappy... Then a year ago we adopted my youngest son. He was my sister&#39;s son, <br/>\nand we hadn&#39;t been in touch for a long time bgecause my sister has drug <br/>\nproblems and hid from the family. Finally, she was arrested, and asked me to <br/>\ntake him. She will be in jail for at least seven years. I agreed, IF I could <br/>\nlegally adopt him. He needed stability so badly.<br/>\n<br/>\nNate came to us a boy who alternated between silent and screaming. We&#39;re not <br/>\nsure, but we suspect there&#39;s been lots of abuse, and certainly neglect. He <br/>\nseems to be thriving with a LOT of structure. When we offered little <br/>\nstructure, he screamed most of the time. He seems happiest when he is doing <br/>\nsome activity with one of his siblings. Well, that and watching Pokemon <br/>\nvideos, which he did for up to fourteen hours a day when he came to us. He <br/>\nstill watches two-three hours a day, which is fine. I&#39;m hoping soon he won&#39;t <br/>\nneed that, but he&#39;s still a very hurting little peanut.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I just told you far more that you wanted to know about my family!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&lt;&lt;Accelerated Unschooling is becoming more popular. I attended a workshop<br/>\n&gt;with<br/>\n&gt;its inventors, Conrad and Lydia Menapolit, in California, and it has <br/>\n&gt;changed<br/>\n&gt;our lives. We are hoping that Conrad and Lydia will be doing more <br/>\n&gt;workshops,<br/>\n&gt;but they are presently in Austria writing a book about Accelerated<br/>\n&gt;Unschooling.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;When and where was the workshop?  At a conference?<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m really surprised I hadn&#39;t heard about it, so yes, please give me any<br/>\n&gt;resources you have so I can understand it, since I get VERY many inquiries<br/>\n&gt;from others about unschooling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I will try to get you more information soon. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on <br/>\nwith the website, but I&#39;ll dig out some materials from the mess I call my <br/>\nhouse and find more official sources.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was nice hearing from you. I hope I haven&#39;t bored you.<br/>\n<br/>\nKay<br/>\n<br/>\n________________</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8815,"nextTopicId":8830}}
