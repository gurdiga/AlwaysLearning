I asked her a  <br/>\nfew days ago whether he likes 60&#39;s music, and she shrugged and  <br/>\nthought and said &quot;some...&quot; and then I looked at his Project Playlist  <br/>\nand it has several good 60&#39;s things, mostly in reference to his love  <br/>\nof Holly.  Pretty sweet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had an e-mail to go look at a blogpost.  I did.  I found this in  <br/>\nthe comments, by someone I don&#39;t know and isn&#39;t on this list, so this  <br/>\nis like third hand stranger quote, but I thought of something  <br/>\npotentially new (to me) and important:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;if I let the kids do what they wanted, they would play computer  <br/>\ngames or watch tv all day&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has been pointed out before that schoolkids watch TV as private  <br/>\nrecovery time from having been powerless and put-upon all day.  It   <br/>\nhas also been pointed out that if parents don&#39;t have anything more  <br/>\nalluring and exciting to offer, they should let their kids do the  <br/>\nmost alluring and exciting thing (which might be video games or TV).   <br/>\nHonestly, if I&#39;m not providing Holly with an exciting afternoon,  <br/>\nmaybe re-runs on FOX TV can!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe phrase &quot;if I let the kids do what they wanted&quot; is the negative  <br/>\nimage of &quot;I don&#39;t let the kids do what they want.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nGoing through my page on such dire predictions<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/ifilet\">http://sandradodd.com/ifilet</a>    (which is &quot;If I let&quot; and not &quot;I  <br/>\nfilet,&quot; for those of you who are thinking sharp knives and fish),   <br/>\nhere are some of the other statements clearly seen in the reflection  <br/>\nof the glass each parent freely chose to share with the world:<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t let him/them.  1111<br/>\nMy boys are not allowed to self-direct (or they would be reading  <br/>\nHardy Boys!)<br/>\nI don&#39;t let him.<br/>\nShe is not left to herself to be inspired (or she would read all day!!)<br/>\nMy son doesn&#39;t have his way.<br/>\nWe drag his nose away from things.<br/>\nThey&#39;re not allowed to.<br/>\nI don&#39;t leave him to his own plans.<br/>\nI don&#39;t let my kids hang out.<br/>\nI won&#39;t try that.<br/>\nWe don&#39;t allow them to.<br/>\nI say that&#39;s enough--get outside and play, now.<br/>\nWe make him once in a while.<br/>\nMy boys are lazy (that&#39;s a direct quote--same in the image as the  <br/>\nreflection; bummer)<br/>\nI don&#39;t allow.<br/>\nI don&#39;t leave him to his own devices.<br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t have his choice.<br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t have his way.<br/>\nWe make him stop.<br/>\nI limit it.<br/>\nThey&#39;re not allowed to.<br/>\n<br/>\nFriends (say I, from my soapbox) THAT is exactly WHY some children  <br/>\nwould love nothing more than to face a screen all day and never turn  <br/>\naround, because when they do turn around (or way before, it seems)  <br/>\nsomeone is making them, telling them, insulting them, NOT allowing,  <br/>\ngiving, leaving, letting.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child feels powerless he will be needy of power.<br/>\nIf a child feels limited,  he will be needy of freedom.<br/>\nIf a child is never left alone and never left to choose, he will need  <br/>\nprivacy and choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst give them all those things.
