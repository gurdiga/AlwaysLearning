Ouch, the street is hot when <br/>\nbarefoot. This week we wound down all our Spring activities, Little league, <br/>\nBrownies, our Homeschool play and talent show. Today we skipped going to a <br/>\nfarm to plant pumpkins, skipped parkday, and stayed in our sleeping clothes <br/>\nor no clothes until 4pm. My 2 and 5 year olds cuddled down with me for a <br/>\nlong nap, while my 7 year old went to a friends house for a bit. We made <br/>\ncornhusk dolls, my nursing toddler proptly needed a baby and mommy so the <br/>\nbaby could nurse. At 4:30 we woke the kids, put on our swim suits and went <br/>\nfor our daily splash at the local pool, a 1/2 block from home. Now the kids <br/>\nand Tim are watching Harry Potter, again, I&#39;m typing more than I have in <br/>\nmonths, and everyone has eaten. Today was refreshing for I never started the <br/>\ncar, never looked for shoes, never packed a lunch on the go, never had to <br/>\nwait with my toddler at another kids activity. We were tired from our <br/>\nweekend in Tahoe. The kids still fussed. Riley throw a tantrun because he <br/>\ncould not play a song on the piano. I handled it well and I&#39;m glad to share <br/>\nwith you all that I did not tantrum with him. We read, we played, we napped.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary in Davis, Ca.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.msn.com\">http://mobile.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7495,"nextTopicId":7493}}
