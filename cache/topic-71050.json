Also, Rue Kream’s book “Parenting a Free Child: An Unschooled Life is wonderful as is Pam Laricchia’s “Free To Learn: Five Ideas for a Joyful Unschooling Life.”   Pam now has a second book I haven’t read yet, but would feel confident suggesting it based on her other writings. Her website is very nice, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Holt’s Learning All The Time is a light and short little book if you’re already sold on the ideas of unschooling. It doesn’t go too deep, mostly revisiting some of his ideas from earlier writings. He was working on a new book when he died and Learning All The Time was put together after his death from that work he left unfinished, and his notes.  It’s not the best of his writing, but it’s brief and could be sweet reinforcement and reassurance if you’ve already decided to unschool. <br/>\n<br/>\nI really like John Holt and I think each of his books had insights into children and learning and schooling that apply even today, but that would be a lot of reading and I think you’d find the more current writers more useful for your daily life. Later, when you have more time you could read Holt’s stuff, maybe.  I especially enjoyed reading his books in the order he wrote them and seeing the evolution of his ideas as the years went by.  Several of his books were updated and revised in his lifetime and those have his notes where he changed his mind or reconsidered and that’s really interesting. He was a wonderful, clear writer and I still sometimes pick up one of his books and read a chapter or two.  I have at different times boxed them up and put them under the eves but they always make their way back to my night stand.  He was brilliant. I feel like he was invaluable to my understanding of human learning.  But while your time is limited this list will probably help you more than anything. You can’t ask John Holt questions anymore but you can ask Sandra, Pam and Joyce.  They’re not only unschooling advocates and great writers, they’re parents of children who grew up without schooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"Alex Polikowsky","from":"Alex Polikowsky &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Essential John Holt Recommendation?","postDate":"1364157192","msgId":71057,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE3OEI0MDA5LTYxRDktNDlERS1CMDJFLUU0QjhERjYxQzJDOUB5YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGtpbm1kZytubHUwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtpbm1kZytubHUwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71056,"nextInTopic":71058,"prevInTime":71056,"nextInTime":71058,"topicId":71050,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":".

Somewhere along the way I read &quot;How Children Fail&quot; - I think his earliest book, the only one in my local library - which is a decent critique of public schools and a somewhat hopeful look at how they might be improved, but otherwise not terribly useful and I wasn&#39;t impressed with him. <br/>\n<br/>\nA better place to start might be to think about the sorts of questions you have about your own kids and also about the sort of writing which appeals to you. If you&#39;re interested in how learning works in a sort of general way, you might like Frank Smith&#39;s the Book of Learning and Forgetting. If you&#39;re worried about technology and commercialism, you might benefit from Everything Bad is Good for You. If you&#39;re interested in the idea that children can learn without rewards or punishments you might like Maria Montessori&#39;s original The Montessori Method, as well as Alfie Kohn&#39;s Punished by Rewards and Rue Kream&#39;s Raising a Free Child. If you&#39;re looking for nuts-and-bolts, how unschooling acutally works, read Sandra&#39;s book. In fact, read Sandra&#39;s book period. It&#39;s easy to pick up and put down, you can jump around, and it has a little of everything. I haven&#39;t read Pam L&#39;s book, so I don&#39;t know what to say about it except other unschoolers I trust have recommended it, and that&#39;s saying something. <br/>\n<br/>\nSomething I did when Mo was little was to set my Yahoo Group message delivery to Digest and then print out the daily digests to read during the day. It isn&#39;t such a big deal now, since there aren&#39;t often dozens of posts in a day, but it was a nice way to carry other unschoolers around in my pocket, as it were. In my spare moments I could pull out my pages and read a little and make notes in the margins and on the back if I had questions or comments of my own. It was a good exercise in editing! I could write and go back and read what I wrote an hour later without having posted, and see the holes in my own thinking better for it. It was Great for shifting my thinking to something more positive - reading my own words and wincing over them &quot;do I really think that? eeeeew!&quot; helped me change.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":335635580,"authorName":"Angeline Taylor","from":"Angeline Taylor &lt;RainbowSkyArts@...&gt;","profile":"horsegirl102","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Essential John Holt Recommendation?","postDate":"1364152148","msgId":71053,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlEN0MxODc0LTA4MTUtNDM4NC1CNEQ0LUZGOTc5Nzc1NUY0OUBnbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGtpbjhoYStjZnBxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtpbjhoYStjZnBxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71052,"nextInTopic":71055,"prevInTime":71052,"nextInTime":71054,"topicId":71050,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"What turned me on to unschooling was John Holt and I read 2 of his books - Learning all the time - Teach your Own Both are excellent.
