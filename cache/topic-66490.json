The multi-task jobs I&#39;d bring with me to where my daughter was and pick up and put down work as needed. Things I needed to focus on I did in the evenings when my partner was available to spend time with my daughter. Now we&#39;ve flipped rolls and he does something similar, but since she&#39;s older he can also plan to do some focused work during the times of the day when she&#39;s deeply involved in a project of her own. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Organic Schedule Possible?","postDate":"1333081410","msgId":66491,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENCMDI1OUMzLUJENjctNEI4QS1CRjdGLTMzRENEODJDQjQyREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpsMzRvdis2cWxwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpsMzRvdis2cWxwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":66490,"nextInTopic":66495,"prevInTime":66490,"nextInTime":66492,"topicId":66490,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- They are very good at playing by themselves and with each other but, like most of us, flag in the afternoon.-=- Instead of using a timer, then, play with","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1158284404\">-=- They are very good at playing by themselves and with each other but, like most of us, flag in the afternoon.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of using a timer, then, play with them and then when they&#39;re tired, put on a great video and do your work nearby while they&#39;re watching that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you&#39;re not ever leaving the six year old to watch the four year old.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-On our first day, Monday, I used a timer to divide my work time from our together time - about an hour at a time in the morning and about 30 to 45 minutes at a time in the afternoon.

It made me think I should stick with using a timer at least until we all get used this new life.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI like the idea of letting each day proceed more organically but am not sure if it&#39;s something I should jump into or stick with a timer for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like opinions on the timer thing and to see what other approaches have worked for others.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA little more info just in case it&#39;s pertinent: We live and work on our farm.

The children are not required to do things related to farming but are thanked and paid when they do.   They are very good at playing by themselves and with each other but, like most of us, flag in the afternoon.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for any insights and experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nAloha,<br/>\nMiliana</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66452,"nextTopicId":66506}}
