It was<br/>\nwonderful.  We stayed in a little cabin not far from Ruidoso for a few<br/>\ndays....it rained so we played board games all day and went for ice cream in<br/>\ntown.  The kids still talk about Zach eating a scoop of ice cream that was<br/>\nas big as his head. (he was 2).  We went to Carlsbad, and over to Lincoln.<br/>\nWe all imagined we were Billy the Kid escaping from jail.  We hit White<br/>\nSands and played and played and played.  On the way home we stopped in<br/>\nLangtry and paid homage to my hero, Judge Roy Bean &quot;Law West of the Pecos.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was so fun and interesting and memorable.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2162,"nextTopicId":299}}
