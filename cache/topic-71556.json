He knows it&#39;s going to be rough at times and he wants help getting Through the rough stuff.

That always takes a long recovery, but school doesn&#39;t help.  When kids are grieving, it&#39;s impossible to expect a large group of children to understand.  And it seems schools often ask for stories, or art, about families and parents, or send something home &quot;for your mom and dad to sign&quot; and there will be reminders galore.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the school question, though, what you wrote seems to be largely about you and your beliefs and preferences:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I felt it was for the best,-=-<br/>\n-=- He said he wanted to go to school .... I told him he could go to a Free School....-=-<br/>\n-=-I told him that I&#39;ll enroll him ...-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Everywhere Joseph looks, he finds stories of children&#39;s struggles at<br/>\nschool. I think he wants to experience this himself. He said to me,<br/>\nyesterday &quot;Mom, if I come home from school and say &#39;school&#39;s<br/>\nterrible&#39;, don&#39;t tell me to quit&quot;. He has also echoed what he has<br/>\nheard from his grandmother and Paul: &quot;school will help me get on a<br/>\nschedule&quot;.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he&#39;s interested in stories, and production, and he will probably learn things from school that you didn&#39;t, and that you can&#39;t imagine, because he sees things in a different way.  That&#39;s not bad.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-A few weeks ago, I told him that I&#39;ll enroll him somewhere this fall,<br/>\nbut wonder if maybe I shouldn&#39;t have. It is too late to enroll in any<br/>\nschools besides our zoned school. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about Clonlara?  He could correspond with teachers, have a schedule, feel a little like he&#39;s in school, and yet be safe at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can afford to, what about offering him something other than school for a whileï¿½a trip out of state, or something that he wouldn&#39;t be able to do if he were in school.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I think Joseph is still in mourning, as well as still kind of deschooling. I&#39;m<br/>\nprepared to unschool until he leaves home.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he thinks school is where the learning is, he&#39;s not &quot;kind of deschooling.&quot;  He&#39;s still a school kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut parents need to deschool much more and much longer than any child does, so if unschooling seems like a good idea to you, get on it a little more agressively for yourself, maybe.  If he doesn&#39;t see the learning that&#39;s happening, it&#39;s possible that you&#39;re missing some of it too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you haven&#39;t read Pam Laricchia&#39;s intro, please do.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://livingjoyfully.ca\">http://livingjoyfully.ca</a><br/>\nHer books or mine might help you be clearer on the kinds of things you could say and do that would make school seem less important and less desirable.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe says he&#39;s a city kid.  There are other cities you could visit.  There will be a small unschooling conference in October in Southern California (when they have the site, we&#39;ll know the date).  There is the HSC conference in Sacramento in August that might be a fun vacation for you and Pam Laricchia is speaking this year.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGetting out and being around unschoolers who are his age or older could help you both.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Son Wants to Go to School","postDate":"1370606253","msgId":71558,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFCNDJGRTg2LTc2OEEtNDU2OS04M0IyLTY3MTk0OUEwQzdDQ0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEU1MTFEOTkzLTUyOTMtNEVGQy1BMDE2LTA4NTg3QTAyOEMzNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBQmttaGRFcWNWNlNOdFBIbnNDNm83RkxHQjV0QTA3Q01PbV90OGp1RStjVVUrbjVqQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPEU1MTFEOTkzLTUyOTMtNEVGQy1BMDE2LTA4NTg3QTAyOEMzNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":71557,"nextInTopic":71559,"prevInTime":71557,"nextInTime":71559,"topicId":71556,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Tanya wrote and said it was fine to leave it up, so responses are open, if any of you have ideas.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1766021244\">Tanya wrote and said it was fine to leave it up, so responses are open, if any of you have ideas.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Son Wants to Go to School","postDate":"1370543990","msgId":71557,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU1MTFEOTkzLTUyOTMtNEVGQy1BMDE2LTA4NTg3QTAyOEMzNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBQmttaGRFcWNWNlNOdFBIbnNDNm83RkxHQjV0QTA3Q01PbV90OGp1RStjVVUrbjVqQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBQmttaGRFcWNWNlNOdFBIbnNDNm83RkxHQjV0QTA3Q01PbV90OGp1RStjVVUrbjVqQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":71556,"nextInTopic":71558,"prevInTime":71556,"nextInTime":71558,"topicId":71556,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-My son has asked to go back to school.

He expects to hate it, but says<br/>\nthat it&#39;s worth it, because, he wants to be considered normal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s some of our back story:<br/>\n<br/>\nJoseph went to a 2.5 hour a day pre-k, tried out a kindergarten for<br/>\nthe first three weeks of the next school year (he was glad to quit<br/>\nthat place), went to another kindergarten for three months toward the<br/>\nend of that school year (didn&#39;t want to leave, but I felt it was for<br/>\nthe best, then), went to a full year of 1st grade, homeschooled<br/>\n(unschoolish) for 2nd and 3rd, unschooled for 4th. Now is the end of<br/>\n(what his Dept. of Education paperwork calls) 4th grade.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband, Joseph&#39;s father, Paul, killed himself in January, 2012.<br/>\nPaul had had bouts of depression since he was a kid, until his final<br/>\ndepressed period, which lasted from when Joseph was 5 until he died. A<br/>\nfew months before Paul died, Joseph tried out for Manhattan Free (as<br/>\nin democratic) School. He said he wanted to go to school to make Paul<br/>\nhappy. I told him he could go to a Free School. In the week that he<br/>\nwas there, Joseph broke every rule that they had, and wasn&#39;t excepted.<br/>\nI think he was testing them.<br/>\n<br/>\nDurring the 2nd and 3rd grade homeschooling years, Joseph often ended<br/>\nup around kids he didn&#39;t like and in classes that weren&#39;t fun. We had<br/>\nto be out of the apartment, because of Paul, and I often made bad<br/>\nchoices as to where we should be.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSome about Joseph:<br/>\n<br/>\nJoseph is very interested in popular culture, though he does have very<br/>\npersonal opinions on all things; since he was very little, he has been<br/>\nskilled at figuring out what the latest craze is, and using it as a<br/>\nconversation starter, or ice breaker. He&#39;s a story teller, of many<br/>\nforms; writing, drawing, verbally telling and more. He studies the<br/>\nproduction of television, movies and web shows, and also, to a lesser<br/>\nextent, stage shows. We live in New York City, and I have been able to<br/>\noffer him a lot of access to these fields.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis past year and a half, we&#39;ve done some big things (Comic Con,<br/>\nMaker Faire, Medieval Festival, Disney World, a cruise, Unschooler&#39;s<br/>\nWaterpark Gathering) that he enjoyed and later talks about fondly, but<br/>\nmost days he chooses to stay at home. He has online friends that he<br/>\nthoroughly enjoys. They live in other time zones, so he sleeps more in<br/>\nthe day than at night. They get together via KIK (online texting),<br/>\nClub Penguin Private Servers, and YouTube groups (they make movies by<br/>\nrecording themselves on Club Penguin and adding music and special<br/>\neffects and editing). He found them via You Tube, about a year ago.<br/>\nSome homeschool, some don&#39;t. Non &quot;virtually&quot;, he&#39;s decided (this year)<br/>\nthat he doesn&#39;t like playing with large groups of kids, so, has two<br/>\nfriends that he occasionally plays with, but he&#39;ll pass on seeing them<br/>\nif they are part of a large group.<br/>\n<br/>\nEverywhere Joseph looks, he finds stories of children&#39;s struggles at<br/>\nschool. I think he wants to experience this himself. He said to me,<br/>\nyesterday &quot;Mom, if I come home from school and say &#39;school&#39;s<br/>\nterrible&#39;, don&#39;t tell me to quit&quot;. He has also echoed what he has<br/>\nheard from his grandmother and Paul: &quot;school will help me get on a<br/>\nschedule&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few weeks ago, I told him that I&#39;ll enroll him somewhere this fall,<br/>\nbut wonder if maybe I shouldn&#39;t have. It is too late to enroll in any<br/>\nschools besides our zoned school. I have fears about it&#39;s safety, and<br/>\nalso extremely negative influences of both the kids and teachers. We<br/>\ncould move. Joseph says that he&#39;s a City Kid though, and wants to stay<br/>\nhere. If he continues, he&#39;d have to switch schools for middle school,<br/>\nwhich starts the following year. We&#39;d then have a better chance<br/>\n(though still slim) at getting him into a safer school, because we&#39;d<br/>\nhave more choices. I could try to stall, by pointing that out to him.<br/>\nI do wish him to have more time to settle in to our new life. I think<br/>\nJoseph is still in mourning, as well as still kind of deschooling. I&#39;m<br/>\nprepared to unschool until he leaves home.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice or thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nTanya</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71549,"nextTopicId":71563}}
