We&#39;ve thrown eggs off the  <br/>\ndeck (cracked in the carton and so not safe), and pumpkins off the  <br/>\ndeck, or jack-o-lanterns.  We threw eggs at the back fence (flat  <br/>\nboard fence, like a wooden wall) when the kids were little so they  <br/>\ncould have the experience, and see how long the egg stays.  I know  <br/>\nfor sure it helped them not have the urge to throw eggs at houses or  <br/>\ncars.  The egg stuff is gross a day or four later.<br/>\n<br/>\nGive them opportunities to throw stuff--sticks into a river, rocks  <br/>\ninto a lake, dirt clods at a wall.  They NEED to throw things.
