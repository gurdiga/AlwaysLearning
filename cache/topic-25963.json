And because of personal interest, I did a lot of writing  <br/>\nwith fountain pens, cartridge pens and dip pens.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband&#39;s cursive writing is unuseable for everyday purposes.  I  <br/>\nknow one young man in his 20&#39;s who went to school &quot;regularly&quot; and  <br/>\ncan&#39;t read cursive writing very well at all.  He can&#39;t be the only one.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s fading.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/writing\">http://sandradodd.com/writing</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt does seem that &quot;keyboarding&quot; (once known as typing) is the  <br/>\nimportant skill to have.<br/>\nEven if I thought cursive was a necessity for life, though, trying to  <br/>\nmake people do it wouldn&#39;t be a good way to get there.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby&#39;s handwriting improved a lot after he went to work at a pizza  <br/>\nplace and took phone orders that other people needed to be able to  <br/>\nread.  It was his first real use of quick handwriting.
