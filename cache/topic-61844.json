We figured when he was a year older, he could go to kindergarten, or first grade, or stay home again.   Twenty years later, he&#39;s about to turn 25 (on July 29), has just received another promotion at his job, and is coming home for a birthday celebration.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust Add Light and Stir will be a year old on September 2, 2011.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/\">http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\nIf you&#39;re unaware of that blog, have fun looking in the archives, and please subscribe!

Maybe it could be what you ask for for Christmas (or other winter holiday of your habitual celebration).    If you don&#39;t celebrate anything in the winter, maybe you could make an exception this time, and start planning now!<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who know they can&#39;t possibly come to Albuquerque to hang out, donations toward the cost of the new search box, or the advertisement-free private chat room, or the site itself, or donations to help me make sure I can get all my speakers here would be gratefully accepted and used well.
