Well a new family with kids his age, approximately, and he played with them once, and now has told me he never wants to play with them again. I asked him why and he couldn&#39;t explain it. He just said he gets a weird feeling around them and doesn&#39;t want to be friends or play with them. He&#39;s also trying to keep his other friend from playing with him and we have been talking to him about that friend needing his own choices. They are a little incessant as far as asking him to play numerous times after he politely told them he didn&#39;t want to and my son is rough and tough which the little boy isn&#39;t. Should I keep trying to encourage a friendship there or trust his gut and let him be? I just don&#39;t want him to miss out on an opportunity as there are no other kids near here.

Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My experience of my 6yo son is that his instincts are always a better guide than my fears.  His willingness to engage with friends shifts and varies.  I do what I can to support him comfortably in social situations.  One of Dmitri&#39;s friends comes here a lot to play (without his mom), but Dmitri doesn&#39;t want to go to his friend&#39;s house without me, even though they&#39;re very close friends of the family--the equivalent of cousins.  I do the explaining for him in those situations because it gets overwhelming for him.  I guess I see my role as backing him up and smoothing things out.  So far it works really well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s another friend he stopped wanting to play with for a while, so I supported him through that, and now he&#39;s back to playing with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we moved into this neighborhood just over a year ago, I realized I had an expectation that Mitri would want to play with the neighborhood kids because my childhood was pretty much that.  He&#39;s shown no interest in making connections here, but he&#39;s happy.     <br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] New kids on block....confused by my sons behavior","postDate":"1321043972","msgId":63718,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMjEwNDM5NzIuMTkxNzcuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyMjUxMi5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGo5am9yYytiaWM1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGo5am9yYytiaWM1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":63717,"nextInTopic":63719,"prevInTime":63717,"nextInTime":63719,"topicId":63716,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***They are a little incessant as far as asking him to play numerous times after he politely told them he didn t want to and my son is rough and tough which","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-59288872\">***They are a little incessant as far as asking him to play numerous times after he politely told them he didn&#39;t want to and my son is rough and tough which the little boy isn&#39;t.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d be the one to answer the door for a while.  Each time they come over and ask to play, tell them to hold on while you check to see if your son is available yet.  Go ask and if he doesn&#39;t want to play, go back and tell the kids, &quot;sorry, he&#39;s not ready to play right now, perhaps later or tomorrow, he&#39;ll come over and let you know.&quot;  It&#39;s an ambiguous way of saying that your son can&#39;t play without it being about your son not wanting to play.  He might change his mind. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***Should I keep trying to encourage a friendship there or trust his gut and let him be?
