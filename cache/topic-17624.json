It&#39;s like we really need to dig deeply into<br/>\nwhat&#39;s going on underneath our actions/thoughts/beliefs so we can clearly<br/>\nsee and relax into the beauty of it all.  On the surface, we may think we<br/>\nare helping... but really we are just getting in the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it can also be very difficult for the child to figure out their own<br/>\ntiming and readiness when they are being told, even if unconsciously, that<br/>\nthey are or are not ready for something.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember once when my dd was just learning to walk and we were visiting<br/>\nmy brother.  My dd decided to stand up, walk a little bit, and then take<br/>\nher first step downward (about 2 inches) onto the outside porch.  She<br/>\nwalked over to the house to hold on to the edge, and started the downward<br/>\nmotion.  My SIL saw her and called out &quot;be careful&quot; in a loving way.  My dd<br/>\nimmediately sat down, and didn&#39;t walk for the rest of our 2 day visit.<br/>\nHere my SIL thought she was being helpful... expressing her concern for my<br/>\ndd.  Her tone wasn&#39;t negative, or worried, but very matter of fact and<br/>\nloving.  But, my in that moment my dd lost her own internal confidence that<br/>\nshe was ready to do this new move.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was much easier for me to see things like this with my dd when she was<br/>\nreally little.  Now I find it much trickier.  For example, I just caught<br/>\nmyself this morning making an assumption.  She wanted to play a computer<br/>\ndoll creating program that she hasn&#39;t played in several months.  This time<br/>\nshe wasn&#39;t willing to do many of the things she did totally on her own the<br/>\nlast time she played, all of them related to reading and typing in doll<br/>\nnames.  My first internal response was &quot;of course you can do this... you<br/>\ndid it several months ago&quot;, but then I caught myself and realized that for<br/>\nwhatever reason she wasn&#39;t ready to handle it today.  But what was really<br/>\nhelpful was for me to realize that the underlying reason I was resistant in<br/>\nthe first place is because she was asking for my help at a time that wasn&#39;t<br/>\ngood for me... it was much &quot;easier&quot; to just say - oh, you can do it.  But<br/>\nin the long run, this isn&#39;t easy at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I&#39;m really rambling now.  Thanks for listening.  I&#39;ve been reading on<br/>\nthis list for several months now, and I think little things are starting to<br/>\nsink in.

I can understand the family bed (although we <br/>\ndidn&#39;t practice it) up until about 2 years of age and then it&#39;s just <br/>\nnot needed for most children, if any of you ever slept with my son <br/>\npast the age of 2 then you would likely get kicked out of bed by all <br/>\nhis kicking about, elbow to the nose, etc. definately a lively <br/>\nsleeper and always has been. I would get no sleep at all! <br/>\nUnderstandably if my ds is scared of something or something is <br/>\nreally bothering him he will come to me and tell me about it, (and <br/>\nif it is the case that he needs to fall asleep in our arms then so <br/>\nbe it, although that is rare and usually only when sick or something <br/>\nabnormal happening) As far as punishment the only kind of punishing <br/>\nwe allow with our son is that of the natural consequences kind. If <br/>\nyou have a child under the age of 1 then no one can expect much <br/>\nsleeping time, but after that you get a routine going so that <br/>\neveryones life can fit together, when the child gets up at a routine <br/>\ntime then they are usually sleepy at a routine time. If the father <br/>\nis in need of more time with the mother then that is something to be <br/>\naddressed and not shoved aside as well, I understand unreasonable <br/>\nrequests on time but having the children develop their own sleeping <br/>\nroutine that fits into the family schedule is not an unreasonable <br/>\nrequest. Most of the time my dh&#39;s day starts between 5-5:30and my ds <br/>\nlikes to be up to tell and hug him goodbye so you can seen that <br/>\nstarting our bedtime at 7ish is what is needed here and works for <br/>\neveryone. If my ds were to be up in the middle of the night which is <br/>\nvery rarely the case (usually with a sickness as I noted earlier) <br/>\nthen usually a simple reminder that the other people in the house <br/>\nare sleeping and need some quiet time is enough, or perhaps if there <br/>\nwas something that you needed to do the next day you could remind <br/>\nthe child of the need to be rested and that mom/dad need rest also <br/>\nor they could oversleep and miss the important event, we use the <br/>\ntruth as reasoning here - we don&#39;t use &quot;because I said so&quot; to <br/>\nexplain things. As far at tears and fits we have not seen any, <br/>\nsometimes my ds asks to leave the door open although nowdays he <br/>\nlikes to have the door closed, but it&#39;s his decision, he&#39;s not being <br/>\nforced to go to bed, only that this is the time for him to be in his <br/>\nroom getting prepared to sleep, sometimes he plays with toys for <br/>\nawhile, puts together a puzzle, sometimes he goes right to sleep. He <br/>\ndefinately doesn&#39;t see bedtime as a punishment! We do hugs and <br/>\nkisses everynight and stories on the nights that he wants to - again <br/>\nI see nothing punitive there???

The best thing you can do for <br/>\nyour family is to keep a close eye on flu like symptoms and if they <br/>\ndo come down with it then call your doc for the medicine that makes <br/>\nthe flu shorter and less severe. So if I were you I would go about <br/>\nmy plans as usual. <br/>\n     Now about the not enforcing a bedtime - WHY??? Your kids do not <br/>\nneed you to help them sleep and you being there probably actually <br/>\nkeeps them from sleeping well. It is not against the unschooling <br/>\ntrain of thought to insist that your children be in their rooms by a <br/>\ncertain time each night. We have done this since the beginning with <br/>\nour son and have never had a problem. We remind him about 7 <br/>\neverynight that it is about time for bed, he knows the routine that <br/>\nhe needs to get his pjs on and clean up whatever he&#39;s working on (he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have to put away stuff he wants to work on the next day but <br/>\nhe can&#39;t have toys everywhere) then he picks out a story for me <br/>\nhimself and dad, goes potty, brushes teeth etc. If he is not ready <br/>\nby 7:30 then no stories and he has to put himself to bed and we do <br/>\nonly hugs and kisses, but ususually he is so we get to read the <br/>\nstories and then do hugs and kisses. After we leave for the night he <br/>\nis free to do whatever he wishes as long as he stays in his room, we <br/>\nexplain that this is Mom&#39;s and Dad&#39;s time to have some quiet time <br/>\nand get ready for bed ourselves and he should only interupt us if it <br/>\nis an emergency. We allow the light in his room to stay on because <br/>\nhe likes it that way. Sometimes he reads to himself, sometimes he <br/>\ndoes a puzzle, etc. whatever he can understand that this is his <br/>\ngetting to bed time and not to disturb Mom and Dad, sometimes he <br/>\ngoes right to sleep - but it is his choice and usually within an <br/>\nhour he is fast asleep. Since we have done this as he has grown up <br/>\n(he&#39;s almost 6 now) it was very easy for us. I can see how your dh <br/>\ncould easily be stressed by the situation - I think I would be <br/>\nalso!!! Why not have a family meeting and come to a good agreement <br/>\non a bedtime, a time for the children to remain in their rooms and <br/>\nget ready for sleep in their own way. Perhaps letting them <br/>\nunderstand how to put themselves to sleep is a gift you could give <br/>\nthem now, and the gift to your family would be a stronger <br/>\nrelationship between you and your dh. Remember that freedom is no <br/>\nlonger freedom when it infringes on the rights of others. Good luck! <br/>\nMoza<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, tuckervill2@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;PS.

I hope your holidays are going well.  I have a question<br/>\n&gt; for all of you.  Dh and I are  planning to go to Florida for the first<br/>\n&gt; two weeks of January (we&#39;re in NY).  My mom called me tonight almost<br/>\n&gt; hysterical because she saw on the news that another little girl, age 4,<br/>\n&gt; died from the flu.  She said we really shouldn&#39;t go on vacation because<br/>\n&gt; none of us, especially the girls (ages 7, 5, 3, and 1) have had flu<br/>\n&gt; shots.  Instinctively, I  feel we should stay home, for that and<br/>\n&gt; finances, but dh desperately needs a vacation due to mental health<br/>\n&gt; reasons.  What would all of you suggest?  Those of you in Florida, what<br/>\n&gt; are your flu stats?   I expect we&#39;ll go, but I am really worried about it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for your advice,  Heidi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

(do you take health products) our family is 100% <br/>\nholistic/alternative health. I know there are others on this group <br/>\nalike also. if you need any advice ways to build your immune system <br/>\nplease ask us. take care!! BTW its always a good idea to follow your <br/>\nintincts anyway. : ) peace, Sonja<br/>\n<br/>\nPS. BEWARE of the flumist..it carries 3 live strains of the flu!! <br/>\nif your considering it PLEASE reconsider. (hospital employees are <br/>\nbeing told if they are going to take the flumist it is mandatory <br/>\nthat they stay home for 3 weeks before returning to work!) <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, badolbilz &lt;ynxn96@f...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi everyone.
