That his transition to older, more independent, mature boy is a bit conflicted with stepping away from what he sees you doing with his younger brother.  I wonder if occasionally he wants to be a 5yo again!!!  And yet doesn’t really, so gets cross with himself.<br/>\nI don’t know your situation of course, but I wonder if there’s any room for spending more time with him alone, making sure he’s getting the attention that clearly he sometimes expresses a need for.  Not for emphasising what a grown up boy he is, but for just nurturing his sense of importance in his standing in the family.  At about that age I would occasionally take my son for lunch somewhere, (he loves good food), without his younger sister, and we would chat and just have a nice time (away from possible sources of conflict and frustration such as gaming).  I would steer the conversation slightly, as my son is not particularly chatty, and lightly ask him questions such as ‘if you could have anything you want in a fantasy world what would you ask for?’ ‘what’s the best thing you’ve learned off youtube?’ etc.    I remember those one on one ‘dates&#39; as very important in what were slightly tricky times.<br/>\n<br/>\nBelinda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Taking it personally","postDate":"1484519999","msgId":77637,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZDNURBRTZCLTc1NUUtNDdCQS1BQzdFLTUwNjMzQzNBQzE1OEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG81Z2k3Mysxc25raDg1QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG81Z2k3Mysxc25raDg1QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":77636,"nextInTopic":77652,"prevInTime":77636,"nextInTime":77638,"topicId":77636,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Kirby was hot tempered as a kid, and hogged attention, sometimes.

Separate problems, but still…<br/>\nWhen he was angry I’d ask him to breahe.  Me, right with him, breathing with him, and if he didn’t do it, I did, to help calm him (and in any case it calmed me, because I could take personally that he wasn’t able to handle life better).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he was likely to disrupt a gathering by needing lots of attention, sometimes I’d remind him of the purpose or principle—who’s the guest of honor?  Whose house is it?  Whatever might be helpful so that he was rminded that different gatherings have different ideals and needs.  In the absence of a clear focus (birthday party, or something that clearly had a main character and traditions), a couple of times I said “Don’t breathe more than your share of the air” or “don’t hog the oxygen.”  I said it lightly the same way I’d say “remember your hoody.”<br/>\n<br/>\nTake food to him when he’s playing.  Some people lost patience from lack of protein.  Holly does and I do.  Kirby some; Marty and Keith not at all.  If a couple of hours have passed leave an assortment of protein-rich finger-foods within reach of him.  There’s a vegetarial list of them here; add in meat, if he eats that, and you’re set:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/eating/protein\">http://sandradodd.com/eating/protein</a><br/>\nGoogle told me that’s not mobile friendly.  Rather than me re-writing a website with 2000+ pages, how about anyone who needs help get on a computer!<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope other people will share ideas, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to disagreements between him and other kids, this is what I did and it worked wonderfully well for coaching kids on doing better in future similar situations.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/peace/fighting\">http://sandradodd.com/peace/fighting</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":487208120,"authorName":"","from":"katerina.kolevablisss@...","profile":"jkaterina","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Taking it personally","postDate":"1484509075","msgId":77636,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG81Z2k3Mysxc25raDg1QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":77637,"prevInTime":77635,"nextInTime":77637,"topicId":77636,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi guys, I ve been reading this group for about 5 years now and I ve learned tons and the discussions continue to help me question a lot.
