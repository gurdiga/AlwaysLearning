This week she watched<br/>\n&quot;The Rutles: All you need is cash,&quot; a mockumentary of a group just<br/>\nlike The Beatles (involving people from Monty Python and old Saturday<br/>\nNight Live, and George Harrison was in it too, and Mick Jagger).<br/>\nShe understood TONS of references--social, visual, musical,<br/>\ncultural. I explained a few things, like the death of Brian Epstein,<br/>\nand Yoko Ono&#39;s art, because without those things there were parts of<br/>\nthe Rutles story that were mystifying to her. Now she wants to see<br/>\nYellow Submarine (which she hasn&#39;t seen for years) and Magical<br/>\nMystery Tour. I&#39;ll either rent or buy those for her.*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOh my!
