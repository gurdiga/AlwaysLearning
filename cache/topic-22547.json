I pulled my now 9 yo son from the third grade in March. I have been reading alot about homeschooling since then and now think that unschooling would work for us, especially since he was refusing to do anything at all that seemed like school...<br/>\nMy question for you today, I&#39;ve seen alot of posts on video games. Basically he would play video games non-stop, not eat, not drink, not sleep if we didn&#39;t make him, only *very* quick bathroom breaks. I&#39;ve decided for the last few weeks that I would let him play as much Gameboy/PS2/whatever he wants, because surely he would get bored with it sooner or later, right? Problem is, there is always a new game out there to try (maybe that&#39;s not really a problem). <br/>\nSo - do I just let him play video games as much as he wants forever?
