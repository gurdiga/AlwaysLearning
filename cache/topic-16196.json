They end up sharing a lot and spending far less than I expected.  The basics are here for everyone, and everyone knows that anything special that they didn&#39;t buy was obviously bought by someone else.  If they want some they ask, and they both usually will share, because the next time it may be reversed.  If the answer is no, then they are free to go and buy their own, they just have to tolerate the delayed gratification.  It&#39;s not any different than special toys they had to ask each other for.  They&#39;ve always been pretty good about respecting other people&#39;s boundaries.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy kids are old enough not to have tantrums much anymore, although no one&#39;s stopping them!  They see Mom and Dad work together equitably and trustingly, so mostly they do the same, especially with this new level of independence.<br/>\n <br/>\nIn my teenage son&#39;s defense, one time he wanted a trig book ($90) which I was willing to buy, but he told me he didn&#39;t think he&#39;d use ninety dollars worth.  We ended up finding a much cheaper, similar version.  Now when he gets a big chunk of cash he puts it in the bank, but that was a tough lesson he taught himself.  He had to fritter away his birthday money ($60) to painfully become aware of how easy it is to spend and how challenging to come by.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe grocery situation is certainly not perfect, but it&#39;s working for us for today; a good &quot;experiment.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nRetta<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
