When you&#39;re tired, stressed, sick, etc, baggage has a way to drop right back <br/>\non you! Online communication is tough anyway, because you don&#39;t get all the nonverbal <br/>\nlanguage for feedback, so one who is used to being criticized or yelled at interprets that <br/>\nlanguage as demeaning. i have the same problem, and sometimes am too sensitive to <br/>\nwhat is said to me online. onward and upward....<br/>\n<br/>\nMy hubby and I grew up dirt poor, and I didn&#39;t realize how much it was affecting my son <br/>\nuntil one day we were at sonic and I asked him what he wanted to eat...and his response <br/>\nwas &quot;whatever&#39;s cheapest&quot;. It broke my heart. And let me know how much that poor stuff <br/>\nwas buried in my subconcious. I mean, we&#39;re not rolling in dough, but 50 cents on the <br/>\ndifference between a burger and a hot dog won&#39;t break the bank LOL! But rather than <br/>\ninstilling the principal of making conscientious purchases, we made the rule of don&#39;t buy <br/>\nanything you want. (see, I&#39;m trying to internalize already the difference) That&#39;s something <br/>\nwe&#39;re still working on, because there are many times when we can afford it, and <br/>\nsometimes when we can&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the yelling, what I consciously did when my oldest was born was decide to do <br/>\neverything opposite as my mother. It&#39;s made a world of difference, and only taken ten <br/>\nyears to get to the point where I can say my mom did give us a few good times, and to <br/>\nforgive her the bad ones. <br/>\n<br/>\nA quote that I have on my office wall says &quot;It is the worst form of immaturity to allow one&#39;s <br/>\nfeelings and desires to control life&quot;. When I found that, it really underlined what my <br/>\nproblem was. I still yell sometimes. But I count it as a learning lesson. I choose to <br/>\napologize to my kids, rather than make excuses for why I did it. They understand that <br/>\nmom is still working through her childhood and she didn&#39;t get the chance to learn how to <br/>\nmake good choices. So we&#39;re all learning together. Let me tell you, they really are quite <br/>\nastute at recognizing the things I hide from myself. :P<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Marianne Pfister &lt;allowinglife@y...&gt; wrote: </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":194874034,"authorName":"Marianne Pfister","from":"Marianne Pfister &lt;allowinglife@...&gt;","profile":"allowinglife","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Oh Boy - Where&#39;s my cave?","postDate":"1136217367","msgId":23713,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwMTAyMTU1NjA3Ljk2NTQ4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjMxMzE0Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYwMTAxMTM0ODI2LjQyNjE0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjMxMzA1Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":23642,"nextInTopic":23717,"prevInTime":23712,"nextInTime":23714,"topicId":23639,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"When I first started reading peoples responses to my initial emails I heard the emails yelling at me.

That is how I read them. Now I see that no one was yelling. I am just used to it, as if it is normal. I remember a friend coming to my house one day after school. We were just stopping in on our way somewhere. After leaving, my friend asked me, &quot;What were you and your mother yelling about?&quot; I looked at her in surprise, &quot;We weren&#39;t yelling.&quot; <br/>\n   <br/>\n  At the start of my marriage my husband had a difficult time sometimes when I would get mad and yell. I didn&#39;t know what his problem was. Eventually, I was able to stop and think about it. There were triggers. I grew up with four brothers, and some times my husband would say something and it would sound like something one of them would say. The difference was, he was being loving and helpful, but my brothers were not. I don&#39;t yell at my husband anymore, because I know the triggers. Instantly, when he says something that brings me back into the past, I no longer see it coming from him, I see the face of one of my brothers and remember that I am past that. This was the most helpful change in my marriage. It saved it. My husband and I can now have discussions about things rather than arguments.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  As for my son, I need to look for the face of my mother in his and know that times have changed. He is not her. He should not have to be the recipient of the hurt anger that comes from within my inner child. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  It is true, I do not yell in public. I do not yell at my family, my husband, friends - only my son. And you are all right, he does not deserve it. He should not have to be the one stuck with my unresolved issues. He is only 5 and does not have the tools yet, where I do. We can learn together on this one.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Today I am going to go out and get some bathtub paint and some of that spray snow and we are doing some mirror art! Thanks for all of the great suggestions and for speaking so thoughtfully and openly.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Oh, and one other thing we are going to do today. We have an alligator farm nearby which is a really great place to go hang out. I have been telling my son that it is just too much money to keep up a yearly membership. My brother-in-law spends $10,000 per child, for private school, even kindergarten; and I ask myself, &quot;What is the big deal if we spend $70 for a yearly pass to the zoo!?!&quot; And yes we can afford it. (I gotta get over this craziness.) <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Can you guess two of my New Year Resolutions? 1. Lighten up on the money. and 2. Stop yelling at my son.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  ~ Marianne<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  <br/>\nMarianne Pfister &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:allowinglife@...\">allowinglife@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  OK, I think I jumped in here too fast and too deep.
