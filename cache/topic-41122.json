They are fine with certain things but not Karl who is<br/>\nused to doing some things he likes and then trading off to do things others<br/>\nlike for a while.  At the relatives it&#39;s mostly what they like and since he<br/>\nis only one, he doesn&#39;t get a turn much with others playing what he wants<br/>\nto.  When we first got here Monday, the cousin his age wanted to play by his<br/>\nrules not Karl&#39;s, and Karl refused to play for a bit because he thought rule<br/>\nmaking should be shared not monopolized.  His cousin *really* wanted to play<br/>\nand agreed when I explained that Karl wanted to make some of the rules too.<br/>\nOh.  Ok he said.  And away they went.  Gradually though, not being used to<br/>\nsharing but more prone to competing for dominance, the cousins have<br/>\nbasically just done what they&#39;re used to.  I don&#39;t expect them to change<br/>\nwhat they usually do.  Karl is overall glad to go by the time we&#39;ve been<br/>\nthere for a while (several states away from home).  Nice for a visit ... not<br/>\nthe place to live though.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 12/21/08, Jenny C &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jenstarc4@...\">jenstarc4@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am *SO* glad, though, that Dave and I have come far enough as<br/>\n&gt; parents that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; our kids know they deserve to be respected.

I don&#39;t think Storm&#39;s gotten quite  old enough to be <br/>\nmore &quot;controlled child&quot; from the &quot;adored baby&quot; stage, so I  don&#39;t think he&#39;s <br/>\nreally gotten much negativity at their house. Wyl, on the other  hand, has at <br/>\ntimes, gotten the brunt of their, &quot;He needs discipline&quot; attitude.  He wanted <br/>\nto go with his brother today to visit them. They were gone about 5  hours, and <br/>\nas he entered the house from being dropped off by them, he said,  &quot;Finally-I&#39;m <br/>\nsomewhere where people respect me!&quot; Poor kid... he keeps hoping for  the best <br/>\nfrom them and they keep disappointing him. (I used to know the  feeling)<br/>\n <br/>\nWhat a wow for me, though. After I welcomed him home and heard  what he had <br/>\nto say, I wondered when that had become such a &quot;given&quot;. The path we  were on <br/>\nbefore we found unschooling would never have led us here to this point,  <br/>\ncertainly. A year ago, a comment like that from my eldest would likely have  given me <br/>\na feeling of pride, or maybe &quot;ah-HA! I told you so!&quot; kind of feeling.
