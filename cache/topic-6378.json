I have been unschooling my boys 7 and 5.  I <br/>\nhave a friend who has unschooled for many years, who recommended this <br/>\nlist to me because I kept calling her with concerns about my boys <br/>\nwatching TV, playing play station and computer games sooooo much (in <br/>\nmy opinion.)  I feel really worried about it!!  We are about to move <br/>\nand we have decided not to have cable or play station move with us.  <br/>\nI would really like to understand what exactly it means in <br/>\nunschooling to say; as long as the are provided other opportunities <br/>\nand you are available to them.  When they are playing computer much <br/>\nof the day and then making up games together, I&#39;m busy reading the <br/>\nlist, doing laundry, nursing the baby,ect...  Unless they ask me for <br/>\nhelp with a dispute or how to make the guy jump on the computer game <br/>\nI&#39;m not around.  Is this okay?  Sometimes I see how unschooling <br/>\nworks; for instance they were playing a Hercules game yesterday, on <br/>\nthe game they ask questions about what happened in real Greek myths.  <br/>\nThe game doesn&#39;t answer these questions.  They kept asking me to <br/>\nhelp,  I didn&#39;t know the answers so I asked them if they would like <br/>\nto go to the library and get a book about the Greek myths, they <br/>\nresponded excitedly YES!!  At these times I think whew this is <br/>\nleading somewhere educational.  I also see the point that one person <br/>\non the list was talking about pertaining to the child getting to the <br/>\nnext level.  It would be frustrating to me if someone came in and <br/>\ntold me to stop doing something when I was right in the middle of it <br/>\nand I was really invested in finishing it.  I would really like input <br/>\nfrom you veteran unschoolers about these issues.  TV especially <br/>\nconcerns me it is so addictive.  I also see a change in their <br/>\nbehavior after watching TV.  We have talked about it, one of the boys <br/>\nsees the change and how he feels after TV viewing the other doesn&#39;t <br/>\nsee it.  I have another friend who is unschooling little guys, she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have TV and lives in the country, when we visit her our boys <br/>\nplay outside all day happily and creatively.  Her kids seem more <br/>\ncreative then mine.  What have you found works for your families? <br/>\nJenn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6381,"nextTopicId":6387}}
