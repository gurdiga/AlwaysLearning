Her fiance is a <br/>\npeace officer/park ranger at Griffith Park in Los Angeles and just got a <br/>\nnotice that he&#39;s for sure being laid off due to city budget cuts. Roya <br/>\nhad just turned in notice that she&#39;s quitting her job because she&#39;s <br/>\nstarting graduate school. Her job was about a 50 hours per week, <br/>\naverage. They&#39;ve asked her to stay on as a part-time employee, so she is <br/>\ngoing to do that, and she has another part-time job for the summer only. <br/>\nHe isn&#39;t having any luck finding work (been looking, because the <br/>\nhandwriting was on the wall for a while).<br/>\n<br/>\nThey had been planning a European honeymoon or maybe Hawaii or Costa <br/>\nRica or at least something very exciting for a Southern California, USA, <br/>\ncouple, but now they are looking for inexpensive places. The wedding is <br/>\nAugust 7th - so we&#39;re talking a week or two starting August 8th.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m trying really hard to find a way to make this related to <br/>\nunschooling, but what I really want is to ask anybody who has any <br/>\nsuggestions or maybe a vacation home somewhere interesting that you&#39;d <br/>\nlike to offer to them to use, please email me OFFLIST.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the unschooling part, I guess. They are having a backyard <br/>\nwedding and are very focused on the wedding as a union of families, not <br/>\njust the two of them. It has been really interesting and fun to watch an <br/>\nunschooled young woman plan her wedding. She has absolutely no interest <br/>\nin doing anything in any particular conventional way just because it is <br/>\nconventional - that doesn&#39;t enter into consideration. It is all about <br/>\nwhat is meaningful to them, what is beautiful, and what brings their <br/>\nfriends and families together with the most love and joy. She isn&#39;t <br/>\nrejecting convention, not by any means, but she isn&#39;t tied to it at all <br/>\n- she picks and chooses what she wants and leaves the rest.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, her fiance wasn&#39;t homeschooled or unschooled, and, although he&#39;s <br/>\nagreed to it for their kids, once in a while he expresses concerns about <br/>\nit. Her answer is kind of simple - &quot;You love me, right? You think I&#39;m <br/>\nawesome, right? Well, I was unschooled.&quot; So - this is a new and <br/>\ndifferent kind of dynamic that will take place between parents, now that <br/>\nour unschooled kids are growing up and getting married and having kids. <br/>\nWhen my husband was skeptical, I could not point to myself as an example <br/>\nof an unschooler, but that&#39;s exactly what my daughter will be able to do.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":383312070,"authorName":"Cara Barlow","from":"Cara Barlow &lt;carabarlow@...&gt;","profile":"crbrlw","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] words that hurt","postDate":"1274483960","msgId":54395,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGltd3ZQTmZjZ2djVkJHbHc1c096azNoc09uY1lIUl91eFpEZWRQVEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGltNVFnYVY4WE84dklFMm5uYmZKaS0tMVVQcHl5VURSbHNLdHJnLUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGh0NjFobCs0OXV2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgkgPEFBTkxrVGlta1FNcWFad2RZVTBJTGY3c1JYNzBpOHFsdmZJaWtwQjNQdTkySkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JIDxBQU5Ma1RpbTVRZ2FWOFhPOHZJRTJubmJmSmktLTFVUHB5eVVEUmxzS3RyZy1AbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":54394,"nextInTopic":54396,"prevInTime":54394,"nextInTime":54396,"topicId":54377,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi: I just want to clarify that my daughter that I wrote about below wasn t a quick-trigger kid like Pam s daughter.

Around the age of 10 she got <br/>\n  the ability to get away, fast, just before she would explode (not every <br/>\n  time, but lots of times). There were people who were critical of that, <br/>\n  called it &quot;storming off,&quot; in a negative way. But, I knew that it was a <br/>\n  big step forward for her and I&#39;d stop others from following her and <br/>\n  insisting that she should deal with the problem immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra talks about how different bodies probably handle adrenaline <br/>\n  differently. For some it hits them fast and furious, for others it is <br/>\n  slow to flow, but also slow to dissipate. Roxana says, and always said, <br/>\n  that her anger took her by surprise, that she really didn&#39;t have enough <br/>\n  warning signals to stop and make any other decision. Even trying to <br/>\n  breathe first seemed impossible to her. She&#39;d be already furious and <br/>\n  shouting or saying things she later regretted, at the exact same time <br/>\n  that another part of her brain would be telling her to stop and breathe <br/>\n  first. Looking back (she&#39;s 22 now and has full self-control), I think <br/>\n  Roxana&#39;s fight or flight body chemical responses were super super quick <br/>\n  and intense. She was little and when she felt wronged, it felt like <br/>\n  being attacked to her, and she had an instant and super strong <br/>\n  physiological reaction - she was immediately awash in &quot;fight&quot; mode <br/>\n  chemicals. Switching to &quot;flight&quot; was doable because those same chemicals <br/>\n  can lead to that option. Switching to &quot;calmly discuss the problem&quot; just <br/>\n  wasn&#39;t a realistic option when all those fight or flight chemicals were <br/>\n  raging in her body.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Rox&#39;s sisters learned quickly to let her leave and then let her return <br/>\n  without much comment. Sometimes, though, she&#39;d have a problem with <br/>\n  friends, who would get their moms involved and then the mothers were <br/>\n  insistent that she should stay and &quot;talk it out&quot; right then and there <br/>\n  and they would get really pushy about it. There were times I said very <br/>\n  firmly and clearly (to moms, mostly, but maybe a few times to kids), <br/>\n  &quot;Please do NOT follow Roxana when she needs to get away. Let her go on <br/>\n  her own and leave her alone.

Looking back, I think it <br/>\n  was that she needed a certain amount of time for the fight or flight <br/>\n  chemicals to dissipate.<br/>\n<br/>\n  She&#39;s a great 22-year-old now - I know her friends would describe her as <br/>\n  even-tempered and sweet. She still does have a very very strong sense of <br/>\n  justice - she feels it strongly when things seem unfair - it infuriates <br/>\n  her still. But she can cope. She has perspective. She &quot;feels&quot; it but <br/>\n  doesn&#39;t blow up over it. Example would be that her registration window <br/>\n  at her university was Wednesday morning. They get 2 hours to register, <br/>\n  then their window closes and they can&#39;t make any changes until just <br/>\n  before school starts in the fall - no adding or dropping or changing <br/>\n  classes. There was a glitch in the computer system during her window and <br/>\n  it didn&#39;t recognize that she&#39;d met the prerequisites for a series of <br/>\n  courses she needs to take to graduate. So it would not let her register. <br/>\n  She emailed support, they emailed her back that they&#39;d fied it, but they <br/>\n  took two hours to do it and her window closed, so she couldn&#39;t get into <br/>\n  the classes. They&#39;re now all full. That kind of unfair frustration is <br/>\n  exactly the kind of thing that used to completely throw her - something <br/>\n  not her fault, frustrating, and unfair. But, this time, she anticipated <br/>\n  they might take too long to fix it and so she looked around for some <br/>\n  other courses to take, found some others that seem interesting to her, <br/>\n  and really more than made the best of it. Ended up with some classes she <br/>\n  would otherwise not have taken and she&#39;s looking forward to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Rox doesn&#39;t let everybody see all her intensity - all the strong <br/>\n  feelings she still has. She keeps it inside and only a few people even <br/>\n  suspect it is there. She can still &quot;feel&quot; explosive about little things <br/>\n  (to others) when they seem very unfair. She will excuse herself and go <br/>\n  to the bathroom when people are playing a game and she thinks some <br/>\n  decision was a bad one. I think her biochemistry has changed, some, with <br/>\n  maturity, but mostly she has learned various strategies to handle it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So - for those of you with quick-trigger kids who don&#39;t seem to have <br/>\n  self-control, I guess I&#39;m saying do the best you can to help them now in <br/>\n  ways that work best for them.

For some it hits them fast and furious, for others it is <br/>\nslow to flow, but also slow to dissipate. Roxana says, and always said, <br/>\nthat her anger took her by surprise, that she really didn&#39;t have enough <br/>\nwarning signals to stop and make any other decision. Even trying to <br/>\nbreathe first seemed impossible to her. She&#39;d be already furious and <br/>\nshouting or saying things she later regretted, at the exact same time <br/>\nthat another part of her brain would be telling her to stop and breathe <br/>\nfirst. Looking back (she&#39;s 22 now and has full self-control), I think <br/>\nRoxana&#39;s fight or flight body chemical responses were super super quick <br/>\nand intense. She was little and when she felt wronged, it felt like <br/>\nbeing attacked to her, and she had an instant and super strong <br/>\nphysiological reaction - she was immediately awash in &quot;fight&quot; mode <br/>\nchemicals. Switching to &quot;flight&quot; was doable because those same chemicals <br/>\ncan lead to that option. Switching to &quot;calmly discuss the problem&quot; just <br/>\nwasn&#39;t a realistic option when all those fight or flight chemicals were <br/>\nraging in her body.<br/>\n<br/>\nRox&#39;s sisters learned quickly to let her leave and then let her return <br/>\nwithout much comment. Sometimes, though, she&#39;d have a problem with <br/>\nfriends, who would get their moms involved and then the mothers were <br/>\ninsistent that she should stay and &quot;talk it out&quot; right then and there <br/>\nand they would get really pushy about it. There were times I said very <br/>\nfirmly and clearly (to moms, mostly, but maybe a few times to kids), <br/>\n&quot;Please do NOT follow Roxana when she needs to get away. Let her go on <br/>\nher own and leave her alone. She&#39;ll come back when she feels ready to <br/>\nwork things out.&quot; I stood guard a few times at park days - Rox was off <br/>\non her own, crying and very upset, and I prevented anyone from going to <br/>\nher and insisting she &quot;talk about it.&quot; I know for a fact that there were <br/>\nparents there who thought I was cruel not to go to her myself, but I <br/>\nknew she needed space around her to recover. Looking back, I think it <br/>\nwas that she needed a certain amount of time for the fight or flight <br/>\nchemicals to dissipate.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s a great 22-year-old now - I know her friends would describe her as <br/>\neven-tempered and sweet. She still does have a very very strong sense of <br/>\njustice - she feels it strongly when things seem unfair - it infuriates <br/>\nher still. But she can cope. She has perspective. She &quot;feels&quot; it but <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t blow up over it. Example would be that her registration window <br/>\nat her university was Wednesday morning. They get 2 hours to register, <br/>\nthen their window closes and they can&#39;t make any changes until just <br/>\nbefore school starts in the fall - no adding or dropping or changing <br/>\nclasses. There was a glitch in the computer system during her window and <br/>\nit didn&#39;t recognize that she&#39;d met the prerequisites for a series of <br/>\ncourses she needs to take to graduate. So it would not let her register. <br/>\nShe emailed support, they emailed her back that they&#39;d fied it, but they <br/>\ntook two hours to do it and her window closed, so she couldn&#39;t get into <br/>\nthe classes. They&#39;re now all full. That kind of unfair frustration is <br/>\nexactly the kind of thing that used to completely throw her - something <br/>\nnot her fault, frustrating, and unfair. But, this time, she anticipated <br/>\nthey might take too long to fix it and so she looked around for some <br/>\nother courses to take, found some others that seem interesting to her, <br/>\nand really more than made the best of it. Ended up with some classes she <br/>\nwould otherwise not have taken and she&#39;s looking forward to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nRox doesn&#39;t let everybody see all her intensity - all the strong <br/>\nfeelings she still has. She keeps it inside and only a few people even <br/>\nsuspect it is there. She can still &quot;feel&quot; explosive about little things <br/>\n(to others) when they seem very unfair. She will excuse herself and go <br/>\nto the bathroom when people are playing a game and she thinks some <br/>\ndecision was a bad one. I think her biochemistry has changed, some, with <br/>\nmaturity, but mostly she has learned various strategies to handle it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - for those of you with quick-trigger kids who don&#39;t seem to have <br/>\nself-control, I guess I&#39;m saying do the best you can to help them now in <br/>\nways that work best for them. Don&#39;t assume that helping them understand <br/>\nhow to problem solve, for example, is useful. Roxana  understood quite <br/>\nwell how to problem solve. That wasn&#39;t her problem at all and all <br/>\nattempts to help her understand it just caused her greater frustration <br/>\nand made things worse. The most important thing I did was really listen <br/>\nto Roxana and really pay attention to what seemed to help and what <br/>\ndidn&#39;t. Enlist the child&#39;s help - it isn&#39;t like the kid wants things to <br/>\nbe hard - kids want to be happy, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":439731658,"authorName":"Joanna","from":"&quot;Joanna&quot; &lt;ridingmom@...&gt;","profile":"ridingmom1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: words that hurt","postDate":"1274463649","msgId":54387,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGh0NmdqMSttaXIxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGh0NjFobCs0OXV2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54386,"nextInTopic":54388,"prevInTime":54386,"nextInTime":54388,"topicId":54377,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My daughter had similar issues with temper, but she was hitting her brother and having anger outbursts with friends.

It had to do with her feeling powerless with brother--not getting her way.  And with friends it&#39;s had to do with misunderstandings which, when cleared up, tend to melt away.  The more experience she&#39;s had with clearing up misunderstandings, the more her mind seems to be opening to not going there in the first place--but that&#39;s taken time and maturity.  The powerless thing has also taken lots of conversation with older brother--he treats her in certain ways that he feels very entitled to and isn&#39;t always even aware of.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talked about it a lot, and around the end of 8 she started to take herself out of the situation when she got frustrated, until she calmed down.  She then had to deal with the storming off putting people off--but it was better than hitting or an outburst.  We approached it like that--that it was a better choice, but that there were better choices still to be made.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe has those intense, quick-fire hormones.  Thinking of it that way has really helped to find strategies that would work for her.  The interesting thing is that when they subside, she is completely ready to make up or move on--she really doesn&#39;t hold grudges, and she&#39;s very happy to apologize when she feels better or has more understanding of the situation.  I think this side of her is charming, and is what has helped her friends to understand and deal with her!  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, at 11 1/2, I can see how far she&#39;s come.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;lalow66&quot; &lt;lalow@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; my middle son Ben is now 7.  he has a tendancy to be quick to anger but for the most part quickly calms down when his feelings are validated.<br/>\n&gt; he also has a tendency, when he gets angry to say things such as shutup, idiot, stupid, I hate you etc.. to his siblings, to me, and to friends that come over.

You&#39;re doing that; it&#39;s not helping.  If he said  <br/>\nyes, he did breathe before he spoke, I would say &quot;Then next time I  <br/>\nguess you need to take TWO deep breaths, because you still said  <br/>\n&quot;idiot.&quot;   I wouldn&#39;t make a big deal about it, but I wouldn&#39;t ignore  <br/>\nit, ever, when it happened.  If we were going out where other people  <br/>\nwere going to be I would make sure he had eaten, had some water with  <br/>\nhim, had some knowledge about the plans for the day, and had been  <br/>\nreminded to breathe if he started to feel frustrated.   Not normal  <br/>\nbreathing, a really long, deep breath.   The best way to get a really  <br/>\ndeep breath in is to breathe out all the air that&#39;s already in there,  <br/>\nand not really fast, either, but consciously breathe out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat might be a little fun to play with, breathing out, and maybe even  <br/>\ngrunting, or thinking of cartoon bulls, breathing out and getting  <br/>\nreally still.   If all the air is out of him, he won&#39;t be able to  <br/>\nspeak until after he&#39;s breathed in.  So before the situations,  <br/>\npractice breathing in.  Maybe make it a breath-holding contest, for  <br/>\nfun, in a light moment, with everyone in the family.   See how long  <br/>\nyou can hold your breath out.  And huff out the last little bit.  And  <br/>\nagain.   And wait.   That breath that follows is going to be all new  <br/>\nair.  Talk about balloons, maybe, and as that air comes in feel and  <br/>\nsee your posture change.  Maybe do it in a mirror.  If he doesn&#39;t want  <br/>\nto don&#39;t make him do it; do it yourself in a fun way and he might join  <br/>\nin.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/breathing\">http://sandradodd.com/breathing</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":222835102,"authorName":"lalow66","from":"&quot;lalow66&quot; &lt;lalow@...&gt;","profile":"lalow66","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"words that hurt","postDate":"1274448245","msgId":54377,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGh0NjFobCs0OXV2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":54380,"prevInTime":54376,"nextInTime":54378,"topicId":54377,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"my middle son Ben is now 7.  he has a tendancy to be quick to anger but for the most part quickly calms down when his feelings are validated. he also has a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-991703818\">my middle son Ben is now 7.  he has a tendancy to be quick to anger but for the most part quickly calms down when his feelings are validated.<br/>\nhe also has a tendency, when he gets angry to say things such as shutup, idiot, stupid, I hate you etc.. to his siblings, to me, and to friends that come over.
