I <br/>\nsaid that I had and they asked me what I was doing that weekend. I said we <br/>\nwould be celebrating my then-boyfriend&#39;s birthday. One of the women asked if I&#39;d <br/>\nlike free tickets to the show but I replied that my boyfriend didn&#39;t really <br/>\ncare for that kind of music. Their smiles never wavered and they left a nice tip. <br/>\nI was mortified when I saw their pictures in the newspaper a few days later!<br/>\nAmy Kagey<br/>\nUsborne Books make great holiday gifts!<br/>\nmy Usborne Books website! <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":779600,"authorName":"KathrynJB@aol.com","from":"KathrynJB@...","profile":"kathrynbeth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: music folks: help!","postDate":"1074537468","msgId":18003,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM5LjNjYWU3NWViLjJkM2Q3ZGZjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":17959,"nextInTopic":18006,"prevInTime":18002,"nextInTime":18004,"topicId":17949,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/18/2004 11:36:32 PM Eastern Standard Time, AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com writes: I m wondering whether there s a name for what The Indigo","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1995787175\">In a message dated 1/18/2004 11:36:32 PM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m wondering whether there&#39;s a name for what The Indigo Girls do.<br/>\n<br/>\nMusic-wise!, you gutter-heads! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n*************************<br/>\nROTFLOLPIMP<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, sort of.<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] music folks: help!","postDate":"1074480819","msgId":17959,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyYi4zOWEwZjczNi4yZDNjYTBiM0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":17953,"nextInTopic":18003,"prevInTime":17958,"nextInTime":17960,"topicId":17949,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/18/2004 6:06:24 PM Mountain Standard Time, kbcdlovejo@aol.com writes: -=-It s harmonic, but it s a round, but they re singing different","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1392736768\">In a message dated 1/18/2004 6:06:24 PM Mountain Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> writes:<br/>\n-=-It&#39;s harmonic, but it&#39;s a round, but they&#39;re singing different words, but <br/>\nsometimes there are up to three voices.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nPolyphony?<br/>\nThat&#39;s different tunes intertwining, or melodic lines going different <br/>\ndirections and maybe crossing, as opposed to the parallel harmonies traditional in <br/>\nwestern traditional  music (most C&W, doo-wop, Jr. High choral music, 19th <br/>\ncentury hymns)<br/>\n<br/>\nMadrigals have usually the same words in various parts but they don&#39;t come <br/>\ntogether too often.
