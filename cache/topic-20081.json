Those types of lay down the law<br/>\nstatements really set others up to feel and act defensively.

However, in regard to seatbelts, if I am driving the car the only option for anyone is to choose not to go with me if they are not willing to put on the belt.  I have been in several car accidents.  One would have killed me if the belt was not on.  There is no room for negotiating.  It is a simple statement of fact and no solution needs to be found. I will not enable the behavior.  I am an attachment parent and prefer to remain attached to the living.  If someone I love wants to defend their right to risk their lives and be stupid they will need to do that in their own car.<br/>\nKay<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20058,"nextTopicId":20082}}
