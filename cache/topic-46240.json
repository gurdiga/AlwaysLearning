It&#39;s far enough to be really gone, maybe? I&#39;m not sure. =-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been enjoying pondering this question and not just because Sandra said<br/>\nmy children were wise.  &lt;g&gt;    One of the reasons I&#39;ve been thinking about<br/>\nthis is that we haven&#39;t made our holiday plans/bookings yet this year like<br/>\nmany people here in the UK probably did in Jan. or Feb and we&#39;ve been<br/>\ndiscussing where everyone would enjoy going most atm.    The other day dd<br/>\nwanted to know about Slovenia and thought it might be nice to go there.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think we&#39;re ready for there yet as a family but maybe we will be in a<br/>\nyear or two.  <br/>\n<br/>\n2 years ago our family went on our first full 2 week holiday.  I knew if I<br/>\nwanted to travel again and have everyone be at least ok with going somewhere<br/>\nagain I needed this trip to be as easy going and fun as possible for<br/>\neveryone.   Thankfully it worked out even better than I&#39;d planned for with<br/>\nthe things the northern part of France had to offer.   WWII unexpectedly<br/>\nbecame more than just history online or in a book somewhere, as it was an<br/>\ninterest even if just a little that we all had we went with it.  I&#39;d never<br/>\nthought about how the old abandoned bunkers and other military buildings<br/>\nfrom the war are still everywhere.  So many other things to see as well left<br/>\nfrom that time, out for all to see.  Some of the old war buildings are now<br/>\nmuseums too, wonderfully non glossy - simple, and inexpensive.  One old<br/>\nlookout/firing bunker had even since crashed down from a hillside onto the<br/>\nbeach and the way it fell one could still walk up some stairs inside and<br/>\nlook across the beach.  It reminded me of the movie planet of apes where the<br/>\nstatue of liberty is in the sand, only this was real.  I felt this urge to<br/>\nget down on my knees in the sand in front of it but resisted.  ;) <br/>\n<br/>\n I&#39;m thinking before unschooling I would never have had such a holiday.  Or<br/>\nif we did we wouldn&#39;t have enjoyed ourselves so much.  We never made it to<br/>\nthe Disney Park outside Paris.   We probably will check out Parc Asterix<br/>\nnext time we go to France though.  Since our trip the kids were really into<br/>\nthe books for awhile and most French people would probably say to visit Parc<br/>\nAsterix before the Disney one!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJoy  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChecked by AVG - www.avg.com<br/>\nVersion: 8.5.375 / Virus Database: 270.13.2/2215 - Release Date: 07/02/09<br/>\n18:06:00<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":401668605,"authorName":"pamela kaplan","from":"&quot;pamela kaplan&quot; &lt;pamelalucinda@...&gt;","profile":"pamelalucinda","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Re: 5-year-old doesn&#39;t want to go anywhere","postDate":"1246982896","msgId":46316,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJMVTExNS1EQVY0RjlERjk3QzQwMEU5RTBDMDMwQUVBMzI4MEBwaHguZ2JsPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIzMTk3NS42NzE2NS5xbUB3ZWI1MzkwNS5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDIzMTk3NS42NzE2NS5xbUB3ZWI1MzkwNS5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":46315,"nextInTopic":46333,"prevInTime":46315,"nextInTime":46317,"topicId":46240,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve been reading this thread with interest, as I have a 4 yr old who often doesn t want to leave the house. ... out of the last minute items.

She&#39;s learning how to be more<br/>\nsocial in group situations.  She pushes herself because she wants to,<br/>\nthen she goes home and dens up.  People have always been attracted to<br/>\nher solid-ness, to her calm and quiet, to her listening and good<br/>\nsuggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were having a conversation yesterday about this very thing!  I had<br/>\nbeen talking to her boyfriend on the phone and he was telling me about<br/>\nhow different they are in this area.  He was saying how he&#39;s super<br/>\nsocial, which I already knew, and that, thus far he&#39;s been<br/>\nnon-discriminating about who he hangs out with, any person will do. <br/>\nSince he&#39;s been hanging out with Chamille a lot, he&#39;s finding out ways<br/>\nto be more discriminating in a healthy way, and he&#39;s helping Chamille be<br/>\nmore comfortable just hanging out in groups of people.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince Chamille is really discriminating about who she hangs out with, it<br/>\nbecomes more about quality over quantity, as she gets older and meets<br/>\nmore people, she&#39;s starting to get a nice quantity of quality friends. <br/>\nIt makes her boyfriend feel special that she is choosing to hang out<br/>\nwith him, because he knows without a doubt that she can and does choose<br/>\nto be by herself over hanging out with just anybody.<br/>\n<br/>\nI pointed out that I&#39;m more of a hang out with people kind of person, I<br/>\ncan be shy at first, but mostly I like to talk with people and hang out<br/>\nand be very social, but that John really would prefer to be at home<br/>\ndoing his thing.  I go to a lot of outings without him.  He didn&#39;t even<br/>\ngo to the unschooling conference this year because he just couldn&#39;t<br/>\nhandle the social stuff at the time.  A few of the men at the conference<br/>\nwere asking about him, and after explaining why he wasn&#39;t there, most of<br/>\nthem told me that they felt the same way, but were pushing themselves<br/>\nout of their comfort zones to be there and experience the conference. <br/>\nThey sent their well wishing on with me to extend to my husband.<br/>\n<br/>\nChamille was telling me that sometimes Cyle&#39;s social-ness is<br/>\noverwhelming, but she&#39;s finding ways to be ok with it, because she knows<br/>\nthat it&#39;s who he is as a person, so she&#39;s willing to accept that part of<br/>\nhim and find ways to work with it.  He is finding ways to get his social<br/>\nstuff in and accept Chamille&#39;s need for quiet alone time, which he&#39;s<br/>\nhappy to be included in!

Where ever<br/>\nthey are, that is where they want to be.  I have a few tactics that help<br/>\nwith this.  I always try to give them plenty of notice if we are going<br/>\nsomewhere.  That way they won&#39;t be in the middle of something when it is<br/>\ntime to leave.  I have told them on occasion that if we get there and they<br/>\naren&#39;t having fun, then we will leave (knowing that once we get there I will<br/>\nhave a hard time getting them to leave when it is time).  I also like to<br/>\nborrow a line from Pippi Longstocking:  &quot;If we don&#39;t leave, we can&#39;t come<br/>\nback&quot; (paraphrased).  Not in a threatening way, but rather as a truism.  My<br/>\nkids get this.  It is impossible to come back to a place if you never leave<br/>\nit.  I guess it has sort of turned into a joke in our family, but it helps<br/>\nbreak the tension of not wanting to leave a place.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, when my boys first started having the option to stay home, they almost<br/>\nalways chose home in reaction to not having a choice in the past.  Now that<br/>\nthey have gone through that phase, they are able to make choices based on<br/>\nwhether they actually want to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, my middle child has a lot of sensory issues, and that influences<br/>\nwhether he wants to go somewhere.  He doesn&#39;t like to be hot and sticky.  He<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like places that have a lot of noises competing with each other.  He<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like fluorescent lighting.  The list goes on.  As he is getting<br/>\nolder, he is becoming better able to deal with sensory input - especially if<br/>\nthere is something he particularly wants to do.  He&#39;ll deal with the<br/>\nflorescent lighting in order to be able to look at toys in the store.  But<br/>\nthis is something I know about my son, and I plan outings to places that are<br/>\npotentially unpleasant for him at a time when he will be able to stay home.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nTina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] 5-year-old doesn&#39;t want to go anywhere","postDate":"1246720748","msgId":46270,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg2MEVEMUI5LTE4REEtNEM0MC1BMDE2LUQ1NjVCREM3Q0E0NkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDllN2Q1MDcxMDkwNzAzMDkyN28xZjUwYjVmYmlmYjJjNjViNWUyNTdmODFkQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDllN2Q1MDcxMDkwNzAyMjE1M3YzMzM5YTllajI1N2E1ODJjMmUxNGQ0ODZAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+IDwxMENGNDlCNjZFNDg0RjFCOURGMDZDOTA1OTY4MDA4RkBEYWRQQz4gPDRBNEUyNURBLjUwNzA3MDdAbWFjLmNvbT4gPDllN2Q1MDcxMDkwNzAzMDkyN28xZjUwYjVmYmlmYjJjNjViNWUyNTdmODFkQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46269,"nextInTopic":46271,"prevInTime":46269,"nextInTime":46271,"topicId":46240,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-.

This happened in our family.   <br/>\nWhen Zoe developed an extreme fear of throwing up along with it came  <br/>\nfear of exposure to things that might make her sick, or might make  <br/>\nsomebody else sick.  If and when we did have her out and about in  <br/>\npublic places she would often grow panicky and request that we leave  <br/>\nimmediately.  She wouldn&#39;t say why she wanted to leave, and I hadn&#39;t  <br/>\nquite figured out what was going on with her yet, so I&#39;d resist  <br/>\nleaving, trying to persuade her to just put up with being wherever we  <br/>\nwere for just a little bit longer so the rest of the family could  <br/>\nenjoy it.  The day she turned away from me and headed towards the car  <br/>\non her own, was the day I knew there was a force compelling her to get  <br/>\nthe heck out of there much stronger than my persuasive pleading.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took awhile but I started to connect the dots and when she stopped  <br/>\nagreeing to go just about anywhere, even to places she used to love to  <br/>\ngo to -- like grandma and grandpa&#39;s house or the park to play with  <br/>\nfriends, I was able to talk to her about it and realized that she  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t trust me to take her need to leave a place seriously.  So, my  <br/>\nhusband and I started making contingent plans -- we never took her  <br/>\nanywhere with us unless we had a plan for at least one of us to be  <br/>\nable to leave with her.  Sometimes this required driving two cars to  <br/>\nparties or family gatherings.  Then, if she started to get anxious and  <br/>\nwanted to leave, one of us would exit immediately with her, no  <br/>\nquestions asked.  After we did this a few times she started to trust  <br/>\nus again and she began agreeing to go out into public more often.  She  <br/>\nstill prefers to hang out at home but she is much more relaxed and  <br/>\neven enjoys occasional outings for errands and social events now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother discovery was that she gets nauseated riding in the car quite  <br/>\neasily.  Sucking on a mint seems to help for short trips so I try to  <br/>\nkeep a stash in the car for her.  For longer trips, we make sure we  <br/>\nkeep the temperature comfortable, distract her with lots of  <br/>\nentertainment, don&#39;t let her tummy get empty and make frequent stops.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a few things to consider.<br/>\n<br/>\nChris in IA</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] 5-year-old doesn&#39;t want to go anywhere","postDate":"1246674064","msgId":46263,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRBNEVCQzkwLjEwNzA3MDJAbWFjLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGU2OGY4YWEwOTA3MDMxMTI5dzIzM2M4YWM5aDdlNDM3MzRkYmM0MmNiZjJAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDllN2Q1MDcxMDkwNzAyMjE1M3YzMzM5YTllajI1N2E1ODJjMmUxNGQ0ODZAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+IDwxMENGNDlCNjZFNDg0RjFCOURGMDZDOTA1OTY4MDA4RkBEYWRQQz4gPDRBNEUyNURBLjUwNzA3MDdAbWFjLmNvbT4gPDllN2Q1MDcxMDkwNzAzMDkyN28xZjUwYjVmYmlmYjJjNjViNWUyNTdmODFkQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8ZTY4ZjhhYTA5MDcwMzExMjl3MjMzYzhhYzloN2U0MzczNGRiYzQyY2JmMkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":46261,"nextInTopic":46264,"prevInTime":46262,"nextInTime":46264,"topicId":46240,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I was also thinking, at first, that some physical problem might be present, but then the child was described as playing on the trampoline, etc., and being very","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-944186092\">I was also thinking, at first, that some physical problem might be <br/>\npresent, but then the child was described as playing on the trampoline, <br/>\netc., and being very active, so that seems less likely to be the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also knew a child with a heart condition that nobody recognized for a <br/>\nlong time and, interestingly, she also became very loathe to go places. <br/>\nI&#39;m sure that being out and about just wasn&#39;t that much fun for her, <br/>\nwhen she was exhausted all the time.So I think it is worth considering <br/>\nthe possibility of a physical problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been thinking about the descriptions of this particular 5 year old <br/>\nand I&#39;m kind of thinking that the focus maybe is on the wrong thing - <br/>\nmaybe it isn&#39;t him not wanting to go out (especially since he says he <br/>\nwants to go, at first, then back out at the time). Maybe it is that he <br/>\nhas a whole lot of inertia - a person who doesn&#39;t like to change where <br/>\nthey are and what they are doing.

She really didn&#39;t have any <br/>\ntrouble filling it - she would go in and find all kinds of cool things <br/>\nto do. But anticipating it was anxiety-provoking for her. It helped a <br/>\nlot for me to have something planned for when she walked in the door. I <br/>\ncould say, &quot;When we get inside, Mr Rogers will be on if you want to <br/>\nwatch it.&quot; Or I could say, &quot;When we go in, will you get the legos out <br/>\nand play with your sister for a few minutes?&quot; It didn&#39;t matter what it <br/>\nwas - just something to focus on was all she needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if there is anything in that which might help, but I do <br/>\nrecommend focusing on the possibility that it is transitions that are <br/>\nhard for him, rather than being out.

He was very <br/>\nanxious at that time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we, too, had an extroverted child who needed to <br/>\nbe out and about.  We didn&#39;t go out as a family much <br/>\nfor awhile there; one parent would stay home with Caleb<br/>\nand one would go out with Amelia.<br/>\n<br/>\nCaleb has strong interpersonal and intrapersonal skills, <br/>\nand people are drawn to him.  When he was younger, that <br/>\nfelt like a burden to him.  He told me so.  I believed<br/>\nhim.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe preferred to stay at home not only because<br/>\nhome is safe and interesting and fun, but also <br/>\nbecause he had a hard time not feeling other people&#39;s <br/>\nfeelings.  If anybody in the room had tense body language, <br/>\nor was speaking in a less than gentle way... anywhere <br/>\naround him; it didn&#39;t have to be in interaction with him... <br/>\nhe would empathize with that person to the extent that he <br/>\nwould feel their feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe still does that, but now he has a greater awareness of <br/>\ndoing it, and while he can&#39;t (yet?) NOT empathize to that <br/>\nextent, the awareness does allow him to get out to do things <br/>\nhe really does want to do, like team gymnastics, or music <br/>\nlessons, or public performances of his music, or skiing.<br/>\nHe plans on joining Civil Air Patrol this autumn; he wants<br/>\nto get his pilot&#39;s license.  This is a young man who was<br/>\nonce so afraid of heights that he would not cross a bridge.<br/>\n(And he crosses suspension bridges almost daily, too, to<br/>\ngo to the museum, or just to the hot truck for a bite to<br/>\neat.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe socializes easily with people of all ages, in the sense <br/>\nthat if I didn&#39;t tell you he was introverted, you wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nknow it.  He is very engaging and a great conversationalist; <br/>\npeople are very at ease around him.  But he is keenly aware <br/>\nof everything that is going on around him, and he gets overstimulated, and then he needs to be home, alone, or with <br/>\njust the quieter members of the family, to recharge his batteries.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother issue is transitions:  Many of us in this family<br/>\nwill continue what we are doing even when it has stopped <br/>\nbeing joyful, when a change of pace or activity or scene<br/>\nwould feel good, because it can feel hard to stop, change <br/>\ngears, prepare to do someting else, and then go and actually <br/>\ndo it.  All of us most always feel glad when we choose to make <br/>\nthe effort to switch gears, but it *is* an effort.  Increased awareness of that has also been helpful in going out, or<br/>\nchoosing not to.  We allow ourselves enough time to prepare<br/>\nto segue from one thing to the next, and are gentle with our-<br/>\nselves about the fact that it *is* challenging for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it helps to realize that being sensitive, or <br/>\nintroverted, or a homebody, is not a bad thing, not at all.  <br/>\nOTOH, if your child is not just sensitive, but out-and-out<br/>\nanxious, I would certainly do what I could to calm that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nProgressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery meditation, <br/>\nmassage, warm baths, soothing music, cuddling his parents <br/>\nand pets, and quiet nature walks all helped soothe Caleb <br/>\nwhen he was your child&#39;s age.  They still do, but now he also <br/>\nreads, watches a soothing TV show, or does martial arts forms, <br/>\nor yoga, or plays a game, or a musical instrument.  He has<br/>\ndeveloped an awareness of which activity would be most calming,<br/>\nbut when he was younger, he needed me to try different things<br/>\nfor him to see what would help most.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand about family judgements.  At the height of Caleb&#39;s anxiety, he would not cross a bridge.  Our town is criss-crossed<br/>\nwith gorges, so avoiding bridges is hard.  It meant driving miles <br/>\nout of the way instead of taking a direct route.  Yes, I was <br/>\njudged for letting a &quot;preschooler dictate&quot; (&lt;--not my words,<br/>\nthe critic&#39;s words) our route.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen our family expanded and we were looking to buy a larger<br/>\nhouse, we really liked one that sat right on a gorge, with a<br/>\nview of a waterfall out the back windows and a view of the lake<br/>\nin the valley below out the front windows.  You could hear the waterfall from the house, and that is a sound that I find very<br/>\nsoothing.  But Caleb was not at all comfortable about living on<br/>\na property that was situated on a cliff, so we didn&#39;t buy it.<br/>\nLots of people didn&#39;t understand listening to a child&#39;s<br/>\nopinion on where to live.  But it was going to be his home!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI still one acquaintance who tells me that Caleb needs to go <br/>\nto school to get over his shyness.  He&#39;s not shy, and he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nneed to go to school.  The fact is that her son is an unhappy kid, and finds Caleb&#39;s presence very soothing.  But Caleb finds the<br/>\ninteraction tiring, so Caleb doesn&#39;t like to spend much time with him, and so doesn&#39;t hang out with him much.  But she doesn&#39;t see <br/>\nher son&#39;s unhappiness.  It is easier for her to label my son &quot;shy&quot; for turning down invitations.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have had family not understand why I didn&#39;t want them to turn <br/>\non the News Hour in my home, in a room where my young children <br/>\nwere playing.  I&#39;ve had people comment that it&#39;s weird that<br/>\nCaleb sometimes chooses to watch some movies with the sound <br/>\nturned off and the closed captioning turned on.  It&#39;s not weird; <br/>\nit&#39;s very healthy.  Caleb is aware that he is affected by <br/>\nsoundtracks--most of us are; that&#39;s why movies have &#39;em; but he <br/>\nis *very* strongly emotionally affected by music--and so, if the music is pulling on his emotions, he will turn it off and choose <br/>\nto read the dialogue.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople may come around to understanding, or they may not.  <br/>\nIn our family, they mostly have.  It took time though.  (Heck, <br/>\nwe are still working on it ourselves, trying to parent,and to<br/>\nlive, more and more mindfully.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, Caleb has become a lot more involved in the world <br/>\nbeyond the walls of his home than I once thought might be possible.  I am happy about that, not because I think it is better, but<br/>\nbecause I see that he is happily doing the things that he wants to <br/>\ndo.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Sturman</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":213505820,"authorName":"Jennifer Varela","from":"Jennifer Varela &lt;gemini7772@...&gt;","profile":"gemini7772","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] 5-year-old doesn&#39;t want to go anywhere","postDate":"1246647455","msgId":46255,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFmYTNlNzYxMDkwNzAzMTE1N3QyMTA1MzVmaTM1MjU3MWI3NTcxN2I2MWJAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDllN2Q1MDcxMDkwNzAzMDkyN28xZjUwYjVmYmlmYjJjNjViNWUyNTdmODFkQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDllN2Q1MDcxMDkwNzAyMjE1M3YzMzM5YTllajI1N2E1ODJjMmUxNGQ0ODZAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+CSA8MTBDRjQ5QjY2RTQ4NEYxQjlERjA2QzkwNTk2ODAwOEZARGFkUEM+IDw0QTRFMjVEQS41MDcwNzA3QG1hYy5jb20+CSA8OWU3ZDUwNzEwOTA3MDMwOTI3bzFmNTBiNWZiaWZiMmM2NWI1ZTI1N2Y4MWRAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":46254,"nextInTopic":46256,"prevInTime":46254,"nextInTime":46256,"topicId":46240,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We always thought she was<br/>\nvery active but as she grew older the difference between Charlotte&#39;s<br/>\n&#39;active&#39; and everyone else&#39;s became obvious as she was stopping to rest<br/>\nfrequently in between bursts of activity. She ate well, slept well and was<br/>\nslim, so we thought the amount of activity she was getting was right. Well,<br/>\nit was, for her. She was also small for her age, but that again was<br/>\nsomething which became more obvious as time went on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen a few months ago she was diagnosed with a heart condition, which was<br/>\nsapping her energy all the time. She was never really aware of how tired she<br/>\nwas because to her it was &#39;normal&#39; so she was unable to tell us there was<br/>\nsomething wrong.

I&#39;ve offered lots and lots of out of the house activities -<br/>\nthings that range from simple shopping trips to amusement parks to friends&#39;<br/>\nhouses (friends he likes, and his response is that they can come to our<br/>\nhouse) to parks to grandparents&#39; house to McDonalds.  I started to feel like<br/>\nI was pressuring too much, so lately I tell him where I&#39;m going, and ask if<br/>\nhe wants to come.  Or I&#39;ll tell him if something cool is going on (recently<br/>\nhe decided to skip a friend&#39;s birthday party) and let him decide if he wants<br/>\nto go.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe enjoys when people come here, but I can see that he gets easily<br/>\noverwhelmed, so we space out visits and don&#39;t have more than one family over<br/>\nat a time usually.  We have a mother&#39;s helper come once a week and he loves<br/>\nplaying with her, and seeks out a lot of adult interaction when we have<br/>\nfamilies over.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are times when he will say he wants to go somewhere, and then change<br/>\nhis mind as we&#39;re putting shoes on or getting in the van.  If I try to keep<br/>\nmomentum and encourage the trip, he gets very upset, and we will change our<br/>\nplans because he is so distressed about having to go.  The 1-2 times I&#39;ve<br/>\nforced it, I&#39;ve regretted it.  He frequently says he wants to do things, but<br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t want to actually follow through - within the past week he<br/>\nmentioned wanting to go mini-golfing, and I&#39;ve said &quot;let&#39;s go&quot;, and he says<br/>\nnot now, maybe another day (and when I mention going another day, he says<br/>\n&quot;no thank you&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nHe seems to have fun when we go places - he&#39;s social, but is awkward at<br/>\nengaging people - I stay close by to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example - he&#39;s always loved fireworks, and they&#39;re happening tonight<br/>\nnearby our house (about a 15 minute drive), and when I told him about them<br/>\nhe said that he wanted me or his dad to take video and pictures and come<br/>\nback and show them to him - he does not want to go himself.  We&#39;ve seen<br/>\nfireworks the past two years and he loved them both times.  There was a time<br/>\nwhen he liked to go out, and his willingness to go along with us tapered off<br/>\nover the past two years.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe gets a lot of physical activity - we have an indoor trampoline, and a<br/>\nslip-n-slide, and a good mattress for bouncing, and a swing set, and he<br/>\nloves to battle with our pool noodle light sabers.  He seeks out physical<br/>\nplay (sometimes not in a respectful way), and I think that could decrease if<br/>\nhe were out and about more.<br/>\n<br/>\nI worry about him missing out on the kinds of things Pam mentioned.  And our<br/>\nfamily doesn&#39;t get it either - their opinion is why would we let a<br/>\nfive-year-old dictate whether or not we&#39;ll be at a family BBQ.  They haven&#39;t<br/>\nsaid it, but I think they blame us and think that if we made him go more<br/>\nplaces then he wouldn&#39;t want to be home so much.

I have known kids who didn&#39;t play outside - all their <br/>\ninterests were indoors. That wouldn&#39;t worry me.

You can bring a lot of <br/>\nthe world to him, but taking him out into the world really is part of <br/>\nunschooling. On the other hand, he&#39;s young and probably a very <br/>\nintroverted kid who doesn&#39;t have high social needs and it may be that he <br/>\nsimply has everything he needs right there to keep him blissfully happy. <br/>\nIf that&#39;s the case, I would probably, if I was his mom, entice him out <br/>\nonce a week or so because &quot;I&quot; would feel that he was missing out on <br/>\nthings - simple things like seeing the piles of fruits and veggies at <br/>\nthe grocery store or the big heavy machinery at a construction site or <br/>\ncool things like a children&#39;s museum or hands-on science center or a <br/>\nmovie on a big screen in a theater, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow did it go the few times he has been out of the house?

He was here in <br/>\nLA and held interviews with different people all evening as they watched the <br/>\ntelecast - his program filled the commercial breaks for the no-commercial <br/>\nBBC telecast.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe repeat gig ended when they lost the contract (to Channel 4 I believe) <br/>\nfor a few years.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s very tall and very into purple.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first year I did it Jayn was a nursing toddler. I brought her with me, <br/>\nand had a friend who knew her come and be the sitter with her, in the next <br/>\nroom. It was OK. The following year they told me I couldn&#39;t bring my baby to <br/>\nthe set anymore, because they were worried about insurance. That was OK too. <br/>\nShe came with me doing all my shopping but not to set. She visited for about <br/>\n2 minutes with James then he took her away. She shopped the third year too, <br/>\nand I worked it so that I wasn&#39;t there the night of the telecast. She was <br/>\nmuch more patient in the car and visiting then (5 I think) than I think she <br/>\nwould be now, and she was content to have MacDonalds worked in to the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe experience did make it very clear to me that the kind of work I used to <br/>\ndo and unschooling parenting were not particularly compatible. She had a <br/>\nbetter time when she came to the theater with me, but I think again it was <br/>\nbecause she was so little.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say, in the absence of her friends for playdates, Jayn wants even <br/>\nmore of my attention now at 9, than she seemed to at 6. Maybe that&#39;s not <br/>\naccurate, but my perception based on my belief that she &quot;should&quot; be more <br/>\ncapapble of entertaining herself at 9 than at 6. Maybe it&#39;s just the kind of <br/>\nattention she wants is considerably more mentally demanding. She used to be <br/>\nhappy with me brushing the dolly&#39;s hair and zoneing out a bit while she <br/>\narranged them in rows with their teacups. Now she wants me to contribute <br/>\nsalient information and coherent dialog to the detective storyline the dolls <br/>\nare enacting. (Meanwhile only she knows whodunit.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a long time ago now that Jayn stopped being interested in attending <br/>\nhome school park days other than the play activity after dance class on <br/>\nTuesdays. She is somewhat of a homebody, although perhaps not to the extent <br/>\nof the OP&#39;s son. She is always on the lookout for our neighbors to play <br/>\nwith. She likes to go out to specific friends&#39; homes, rather than just go <br/>\nout for the sake of it. If we had a large yard with gardening and a swing <br/>\nset, she would probably want to go to the park even less. She likes theme <br/>\nparks, and museums IF we are meeting her friends there.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also comes in waves. When we are on nights, there are few places to go. <br/>\nWe have a built in down time in our schedule. It&#39;s harder for you having a <br/>\nsecond child with higher social, out and about needs.

In the course of that we talk about<br/>\npeople, places, cultures, ideas, etc and he seems to have a good grasp on it<br/>\nall.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe chats with people online in other countries and even manages to converse<br/>\nwith those who know little english.  Perhaps not knowing how this is<br/>\nsupposed to limit him makes it possible and, so far, all of my concerns have<br/>\nbeen unnecessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nKris<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, Jul 2, 2009 at 9:53 PM, Karen Hsu &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kcbhsu@...\">kcbhsu@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know what other details might help, so I&#39;ll stop here.

He really does<br/>\nlove being at home.  I have always done all I could to encourage but<br/>\nhopefully without being pushy going out and doing new fun exciting things.<br/>\nI&#39;ve even used McDonald&#39;s a few times for enticement when he was younger.<br/>\n&lt;g&gt;  I too always worried at least a little that he was missing out on<br/>\nthings and realized only the other day that I never really understood how he<br/>\ncould love being home so much of the time!   <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nDd, now 12, always seemed to like going out and so we did as much as I could<br/>\nand she seemed to like that.  So I really struggled and still do just a<br/>\ntinge when things come up that she would have gone to in the past that she<br/>\nnow doesn&#39;t.  This began when ds was ready to be home on his own while dd<br/>\nand I would go out.  Well she didn&#39;t want to go then either.  I knew they<br/>\nwere close but hadn&#39;t realized this would happen.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nJust the other day both my children and I ended up discussing &#39;my&#39;<br/>\nfear/worry about them not getting out and doing things.  The conversation<br/>\nstarted out about all these homeschool summer activities going on around<br/>\nhere that I felt maybe they should take advantage of and at least try.<br/>\nThings mostly that we/they&#39;d not be able to do normally because of expense.<br/>\nIt didn&#39;t seem like such a big deal to me for them just to try one of two<br/>\nthings.  Well!  For the first time ever they turned it around on me and made<br/>\nme realize it was really me that needed to work some thinking through not<br/>\nthem.  &lt;g&gt;   I can&#39;t say this is the entire deal but I now realize that I<br/>\nwanted for them fond activities and memories like myself as a kid and that<br/>\nwas always away from home and my parents.  Home was just a place to sleep<br/>\nand eat.  Home for them is totally different, much more than a place for<br/>\nthem to just eat and sleep.  :-)    I&#39;m suddenly starting to see the house<br/>\nwe live in in a different way than I used to.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOne last thing, I read a book recently about a television/radio talkshow<br/>\nhost here in the UK.  His name is Jonathon Ross and he&#39;s about 40 now.  He<br/>\nhad many brothers and sisters and his parents felt they could not provide<br/>\nthe opportunities for their children that they would have liked to.  When he<br/>\nwas a young boy television here was just becoming popular and cheap enough<br/>\nfor the regular person to buy.  His parents totally believed in the power of<br/>\nTV and they felt their kids would have so many opportunities seeing and<br/>\nhearing about things they never could or did that way.  Jonathon says the TV<br/>\nwas almost always on even as background noise.   <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nJoy<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChecked by AVG - www.avg.com<br/>\nVersion: 8.5.375 / Virus Database: 270.13.1/2212 - Release Date: 07/02/09<br/>\n05:54:00<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246235005,"authorName":"Karen Hsu","from":"Karen Hsu &lt;kcbhsu@...&gt;","profile":"kbutts1216","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"5-year-old doesn&#39;t want to go anywhere","postDate":"1246596820","msgId":46240,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDllN2Q1MDcxMDkwNzAyMjE1M3YzMzM5YTllajI1N2E1ODJjMmUxNGQ0ODZAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":46243,"prevInTime":46239,"nextInTime":46241,"topicId":46240,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My son is five years old and over the past year has become more and more reluctant to leave the house.

Last summer we didn&#39;t go a lot of places, but<br/>\nhe&#39;d want to go to a park or bounce houses or my in-laws&#39; house or someplace<br/>\nelse fun maybe once or twice a<br/>\nweek.  During the winter the outings tapered off due to his<br/>\npreference, and I thought it was because of the weather.<br/>\nWhen it warmed up he began to play outside more, but other than<br/>\nplaying in our yard (and an occasional short walk down the block)<br/>\nhe&#39;s only been out of the house once in the past month.  The month before<br/>\nthat was probably twice.  When I ask him about it he says he&#39;s got games to<br/>\nplay at home and is too busy to go anywhere.  We have a small playground<br/>\nwithin walking distance, and he doesn&#39;t want to go that far.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like to go places, and my 3-year-old daughter likes to go places, and<br/>\nwhile we create opportunities to go out once a week or so and leave my son<br/>\nat home with my husband, it doesn&#39;t seem to be enough for either one of us.<br/>\n We invite people over, and we also turn down a lot of invitations for<br/>\nactivities at other people&#39;s houses (or parks and the like).<br/>\n<br/>\nI worry that he&#39;s missing out on a lot of experiences by not going anywhere.<br/>\n I worry it won&#39;t pass and he&#39;ll never want to leave the house.  I know that<br/>\nI&#39;m feeling stress over it.  I think that there would be more peace in our<br/>\nhouse if the kids weren&#39;t home all day nearly every day.  I don&#39;t know if<br/>\nit&#39;s anxiety over seeing people he doesn&#39;t know, or if it&#39;s car sickness, or<br/>\nif it&#39;s something else altogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example of a thing I&#39;d like to do:  my husband&#39;s sisters are coming to<br/>\ntown this weekend and will be at my in-laws&#39; house for a BBQ - I&#39;d like for<br/>\nour family to be there.  My husband will likely go alone because the kids<br/>\nwill both want to be with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only other piece of information that might be relevant is that I&#39;m the<br/>\nworking parent, though I have a home office and see the kids throughout the<br/>\nday.  When I&#39;m done working I want to spend time with both kids and feel<br/>\ntorn when my daughter wants to go somewhere, yet my son doesn&#39;t want to, and<br/>\nthey both want me to do things with them in the evenings.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what other details might help, so I&#39;ll stop here.
