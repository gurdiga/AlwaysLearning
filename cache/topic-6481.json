Not because *I* would look bad, but because unschooling<br/>\nwould. It&#39;s hard enough to deal with the, &quot;but what about math!&quot; parts<br/>\nalready, without having someone who just can&#39;t get it tell everyone, &quot;we<br/>\ntried unschooling for two years and the children never learned any math.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, maybe that&#39;s cowardly of me. Maybe we should just tell everyone to<br/>\nbring it on, with the understanding that sometimes it&#39;ll work and sometimes<br/>\nit won&#39;t and there are going to be people running around claiming to be<br/>\nunschoolers who just aren&#39;t even close.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s happening anyway. :P<br/>\n<br/>\nPam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6470,"nextTopicId":6473}}
