Almost like a wedding for<br/>\nHispanic girls at 15.  Around here, she isn&#39;t marrying God, but is making an<br/>\nadult commitment to her faith.  Like a debutante party of sorts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think about this kind of stuff at times for my kids, if they were<br/>\ninterested.  It is interesting to think about how the kids might incorporate<br/>\ntheir ethnic backgrounds into their very Anglo lives.  I have visions of my<br/>\n8yo in a low-rider (he is fascinated with them) with STAUFFER written across<br/>\nthe back windshield in Gothic letters.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie--mom of 4 at least partially-Hispanic kids.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":761,"nextTopicId":775}}
