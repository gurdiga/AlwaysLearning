It can help to think of them as though they were recovering from an injury or serious illness - they might not be &quot;in pain&quot; any more, but they&#39;re still worn out and need time to come back to themselves. On top of that, teens can go through a period of needing to turn inward, spend time in their own thoughts, even to sleep more. Some people call it a &quot;cocoon period&quot;. My daughter is going through a stage like that, and my stepson did, too, when he first left school at 13. Even though their personalities and circumstances are very different, they both need time to &quot;cocoon&quot;.&nbsp;<br><br>Offer to do low-key things together - watch movies, play video games, even sit together to read (if your kid(s) like to read).

I have been reassured by multiple stories I have read about teens who&#39;ve left and sat around for months. So, Nicola is doing whatever she feels like which is currently sleeping and watching/doing things on the computer. The only thing she had kept going were her voice lessons which were thrilling her before but I could tell she was losing steam.
