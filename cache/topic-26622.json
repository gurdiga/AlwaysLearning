(pony pen pals, of<br/>\ncourse)  She has four of them right now and just sent for 2 more.  She<br/>\nalways looks forward to their letters and she is pretty prompt about writing<br/>\nback.  She has almost always written her letters on the computer and printed<br/>\nthem out because she didn&#39;t feel like her hand writing was neat enough to be<br/>\nlegible.  (and sometimes it wasn&#39;t)   Quite often her pen pals write back to<br/>\nher in long hand and she has noticed how neat some of them write.  I think<br/>\nit inspired her to try harder to write neatly.  This last batch of pen pal<br/>\nletters that she sent out were all written in long hand and they were not<br/>\nonly neat, but she actually used capital and lowercase letters<br/>\nappropriately.  Since she began writing, she&#39;s used almost exclusively<br/>\ncapital letters when writing in long hand.  She just found it easier than<br/>\nprinting lower case letters.  When writing on the computer she has always<br/>\nused both lower case and upper case letters.  I was pleasantly surprised at<br/>\njust how lovely her letters were.  The punctuation was right on too, except<br/>\nin one or two places.
