She did the derisive <br/>\nlaugh/snort she does to preface something semi-neutral when she really wants it <br/>\nto be a put-down and said &quot;Well I&#39;ll read it, but it won&#39;t change my mind.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey were staying in their camper in the mountains.  I gave her three books <br/>\n(maybe four) with a sticky note on the best anti-circumcision page of each and <br/>\nshe took them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next day when she showed up she set the three books very gently on the <br/>\ntable in the same place they had been, and said *GENTLY* &quot;Well, things have <br/>\nchanged a lot since I was in nursing school.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we decided to keep him home instead of kindergarten, we had contingency <br/>\nplans.  It wasn&#39;t a life commitment, it was a &quot;keep him home this year and <br/>\nsee.&quot;  When she questioned it, I asked if she wanted to read what we read, and <br/>\nshe (snortlessly) declined.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust this year (early 2003) we got a routine letter from my husband&#39;s <br/>\nparents.  At that time we&#39;d been homeschooling most of 12 years, with three kids.  <br/>\nFor the first time, she said we were doing a good job homeschooling and our kids <br/>\nwere thriving.  (Not the exact quote, but it was good to have something <br/>\npositive, even though it took twelve years.)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;She once said &quot;Children are god&#39;s way of <br/>\npunishing you for enjoying sex.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a weird attitude!  Your poor husband, growing up feeling that he was the <br/>\ngrowing wrath of God (if he knew she thought that).<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Any ideas about how to bring up the idea <br/>\nwithout getting kicked out of the will? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJust don&#39;t bother.  Just say &quot;homeschooling&quot; and don&#39;t talk about methods <br/>\nuntil you have to, and then say &quot;individualized&quot; until you have to say different.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was just a letter that someone wrote to his friend.  On the forum, I <br/>\nthink, at www.unschooling.com, was it?   And Kelly Lovejoy&#39;s husband wrote one <br/>\nto his mom a while back.  Maybe those letters should be put where others can <br/>\nfind them to use them to mine parts.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut with a very small child, just say as little as possible.  The best <br/>\nstories to tell her are the learning stories.  Enough of those build up and it will <br/>\nbe easy to move into saying &quot;He&#39;s learning so much and so well, I don&#39;t want <br/>\nto put him in school where his rhythm will be messed up.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it ALWAYS helps to say &quot;We&#39;re going to do this until it isn&#39;t working <br/>\nanymore.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone who says &quot;He&#39;ll only see the inside of a school over my dead body&quot; is <br/>\njust asking for parental trouble, because they do have a biological and legal <br/>\nrelationship with that child and so &quot;Do you want to read what we read to <br/>\ndecide?&quot; is way better than any form of &quot;screw you,&quot; no matter how disguised it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if you say &quot;If you want to read this [specific stuff], we could discuss <br/>\nit&quot; puts the next move on them.

I am on a few other homeschool/unschool lists. You guys are<br/>\n&gt; great! Really informative, and inspiring. I have a 2 year old son who is<br/>\n&gt; going to be unschooled. We have yet to convey this idea to my in-laws who<br/>\n&gt; are pretty much against every other parenting idea we have implemented<br/>\n&gt; (co-sleeping, breastfeeding, gentle parenting, etc.). My mil thinks that<br/>\n&gt; all children need &quot;training&quot;. She once said &quot;Children are god&#39;s way of<br/>\n&gt; punishing you for enjoying sex.&quot; Any ideas about how to bring up the idea<br/>\n&gt; without getting kicked out of the will? &lt;g&gt; I was thinking of<br/>\n&gt; articles/statistics...any good ones? Books are too much - I need some<br/>\n&gt; fairly quick come-backs. I was thinking of bringing up homeschooling first<br/>\n&gt; and not even broaching the idea of unschooling until I see how it settles.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks a lot!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~Flora, Sean (dh) and Liam (ds)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

My parents live in that <br/>\narea and they are always pressuring me to move up there.  But I figured if we <br/>\never did we&#39;d live in OK because of the homeschooling freedom.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI too live out in the country, about 47 miles east of Memphis.  My husband <br/>\nworks 50 miles further east, so we decided to share the driving and move from <br/>\nMemphis to the halfway point.  People from our unschooling group want to come <br/>\nout and see me, but I find it has to be carefully planned and for special <br/>\noccasions.  Very few people will come out just to hang out, or more than once or <br/>\ntwice.  That&#39;s a huge drawback for me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI only have one child left in the house, though, so we drive to Memphis a <br/>\nlot, almost every day.  He plays baseball in his old league (made the All-Star <br/>\nteam this week!).  Since during the school year the one kid who lives nearby is <br/>\nnot available, we work harder at keeping his friendships in Memphis, too.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s summertime now, though, and he hangs out every day with Charlie, and <br/>\nsometimes Charlie&#39;s friends from school.  Luckily for us, none of them have turned <br/>\nout to be bullies.  (The first kid we met out here WAS a bully and we promptly <br/>\nexcised that little wart.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nEven though we go to Memphis almost every day (it&#39;s baseball season), we seem <br/>\nto be more of homebodies than we were living in town.  We have a huge garden, <br/>\nlike we&#39;ve never had before.  My son has about 20 cantalopes about ready to <br/>\npick.  He gets to fish every day, and he&#39;s learning about growing cotton <br/>\nbecause we live next to a cotton field.  I&#39;m also enjoying something I never thought <br/>\nI would, and that&#39;s pulling weeds!  I go out every morning around 7 (it&#39;s too <br/>\nhot after that), and sit on a flattened box and go row by row.  It&#39;s like <br/>\nmeditation. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo in some ways it&#39;s a real drawback to move away from civilization.  But in <br/>\nother ways it has changed me a lot.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome to the list!<br/>\nTuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":118341190,"authorName":"Kris Vaitkus","from":"Kris Vaitkus &lt;krisev@...&gt;","profile":"abilena13","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] newbie","postDate":"1056345241","msgId":15306,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDgwMWMzMzk0NiQ0MWYwY2QyMCQxYzJhMzE0NEBucm9ja3YwMS5tZC5jb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwM2MwMWMzMzkxZCRmODA2NDBhMCRjNTc1MGFkMEBmN28wYzM+"},"prevInTopic":15303,"nextInTopic":15307,"prevInTime":15305,"nextInTime":15307,"topicId":15303,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Jenny- It sounds like you have chosen a very interesting lifestyle.

I am waiting for the doctor&#39;s<br/>\noffice to open.  Her stomach hurts, has temp and sore throat at times.  They<br/>\nhaven&#39;t been sick much and it is always a new/strange experience to have one<br/>\nof them sick.    I can&#39;t imagine what it would be like with 4 children.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also have two geriatric dogs (old english sheepdog and a bichon frise).<br/>\nI have spent  a lot of time/$ at vets with both of them.  The bichon was my<br/>\nmother&#39;s dog.  They are both l4 years old.  We also have a ragdoll cat that<br/>\nmy husband found over the computer...she is from California, six years old<br/>\nand she came with the name Snow White!<br/>\n<br/>\nWell...just wanted to say hi.<br/>\n<br/>\nKris<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;jennyandchirs&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jennyandchris@...\">jennyandchris@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, June 22, 2003 8:25 PM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] newbie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m new here and wanted to introduce myself.
