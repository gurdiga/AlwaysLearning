I would like to post now because I am so proud<br/>\nof my daughter.  Two days ago she decided she wanted to read &quot;George&#39;s<br/>\nMarvellous Medicine&quot; to me and she said it was because one of her<br/>\nfriends (who reads fluently) reads to her mum at night.  I said ok and<br/>\nshe got along fine with  me helping her on unknown words(quite a few<br/>\nas she only reads what the schools call &quot;sight words&quot; for eg.  it, on,<br/>\nand, the, etc., which she has just picked up by herself along the<br/>\nway).  So we did that last night  as well and she surprised me by<br/>\nbeing able to read a few more words than I thought she knew.<br/>\nThen tonight, oh my goodness if she doesn&#39;t go and read the word<br/>\n&quot;ceiling&quot; (and quite a few other words which I was sure she had no<br/>\nidea how to read).  So now I get suspicious because I know I certainly<br/>\nhaven&#39;t taught her how to read all these words, so I ask her if she&#39;s<br/>\nbeen having secret reading lessons and she tells me that she has been<br/>\nable to read since her 7th birthday(31/12/07.  I ask her how she<br/>\nmanaged this and she says, in the times she has been upstairs and<br/>\nreading books for 5 or 10 minutes, she has &quot;just worked out the<br/>\nwords&quot;.  So I&#39;m not satisfied becos I can&#39;t quite believe it(I take a<br/>\nlot of convincing!) and she says she can read  in her head but she<br/>\njust takes longer to read out loud becos she&#39;s not sure how to say the<br/>\nwords.  I kind of know what she means...I think she&#39;s saying she can<br/>\n&quot;see&quot; the words in her head and is recognising the patterns and<br/>\narrangements of the letters but couldn&#39;t quite &quot;get them out&quot;.  I was<br/>\njust amazed and then tonight to see it all &quot;fall into place&quot; was a<br/>\nprivilege.  I could tell she was &quot;seeing patterns&quot; because if for eg.<br/>\nshe saw &quot;scrunching&quot; she was saying &quot;scratching&quot; . But ceiling amazed<br/>\nme the most becos there is no way that can be worked out phonetically,<br/>\nso how she did it?.....well.....she just did.  Just as she was falling<br/>\nasleep she said there was one other way she worked out how to read and<br/>\nthat was by seeing the words on the page as I was reading to her.<br/>\nSo just thought I&#39;d share.  I unschool but have my days were I doubt<br/>\nthat I&#39;m doing the right thing for my children (I have 2 more ds 3 and<br/>\ndd 20 months).  We do no workbooks, no curriculum, nothing like school<br/>\nat all, just live life and have fun.  <br/>\nThankyou for being here and your reassuring posts which I am sure I<br/>\nwill continue to need.<br/>\nBlessings<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31980,"nextTopicId":31998}}
