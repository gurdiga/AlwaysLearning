The Mother of All Computer Viruses!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you receive an e-mail entitled &quot;Badtimes&quot;, delete it immediately. Do not<br/>\nopen it. Apparently, this one is pretty nasty. It will not only erase<br/>\neverything on your hard drive, but it will also delete anything on disks<br/>\nwithin 20 feet of your computer. It demagnetizes the strips on all your<br/>\ncredit cards. It reprograms your ATM access code, screws up the tracking on<br/>\nyour VCR and uses subspace field harmonics to scratch any CD&#39;s you attempt<br/>\nto <br/>\nplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you drive a chevy, it will start missing like a Ford. It will program<br/>\nyour <br/>\nphone auto dial to call only your mother-in-law&#39;s number. This virus will<br/>\nmix <br/>\nantifreeze into your fish tank. It will drink all your beer. It will leave<br/>\ndirty socks on the coffee table when you are expecting company.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will replace your shampoo with Nair and your Nair with Rogaine, all the<br/>\nwhile dating your spouse behind your back and billing your Visa. It will<br/>\ncause you to run with scissors then fall and poke your eye out.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the &quot;Badtimes&quot; message is opened in a Windows 95/98 environment, it will<br/>\nleave the toilet seat up and leave your hair dryer plugged in dangerously<br/>\nclose to a full bathtub.
