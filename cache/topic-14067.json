I would love to have a natural <br/>\nbirth.  If I am every pregnant again (doubtful, with all the yucky <br/>\nproblems I am having, but maybe) I will again work hard at having a <br/>\nvbac.  However, if I have a live healthy baby, I will be happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nLexie&#39;s birth was a medical rollercoaster.  If I knew then what I know <br/>\nnow I could have and would have prevented it.  Or at least, if I had not <br/>\nprevented the high blood pressure, I would have known my bishop score <br/>\nwas 0 and I would have just had a section instead of laboring for 3 <br/>\ndays, getting a horrid infection after they broke my water, and almost <br/>\ndying from the infection.  Lexie was pretty sick too, and her heart rate <br/>\nin utero went way high and then way low.  I&#39;ve never seen such a fast <br/>\nsection turn around and it certainly saved our lives, but I am wondering <br/>\nif different choices had been made (a high protien diet, for instance) <br/>\nif I coul dhave avoided much of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJanene was a different story.  Her section was truly medically <br/>\nnecessary.  She was sideways, with tummy down and cord hanging above my <br/>\nopening cervix.  We thought she was 37 weeks, later we found out she was <br/>\n34 or maybe 35 weeks.  They tried a version but no go, she turned back. <br/>\n So I fought with them to wait the weekend and come in on Monday after <br/>\nmy parents could arrive from NM.  I went in Monday and they tried to do <br/>\nan amnio to test her lungs--the placenta had shut down.  I had GD and <br/>\nthis is not uncommon.  After trying to get the placenta to create more <br/>\namniotic fluid, they finally, after a very long day, sectioned her. <br/>\n They said the placentia had definately shut down.  She would have died <br/>\nin the next day or so if I hadn&#39;t of been in the hospital.  I really <br/>\nfeel, in my heart that her life was saved, although I recognize I might <br/>\nfeel this way, need to feel this way, to justfiy another csection.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time I was going through Janene&#39;s birth another friend was <br/>\nchoosing a different route.  Her water burst and she didn&#39;t go into <br/>\nlabor and didn&#39;t get induced for a long time, like 7 weeks.  It was a <br/>\nhorrible story, she was an email friend and I wanted to tell her that I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t agree with her decisions but so many others were just supporting <br/>\nher and her desire to have a vbac so I just stayed quiet.  She had a <br/>\nhorrible first birth with her first child, which ended up in a totally <br/>\nunnecessary section.  Anyway, after that long time, she finally develped <br/>\nand infection and her baby died and then wouldn&#39;t be born and she ended <br/>\nup with a section and a dead baby and a lot of guilt and 2nd guessing <br/>\nherself (I&#39;m guessing).  Her marriage almost or did break up, and her <br/>\nlife was forever changed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs bad as a c section is, give me one of them again, I can heal, I&#39;ve <br/>\nhad two and I can deal with it.  Sure, I&#39;d love, absolutely love a <br/>\nnatural birth.  I often grieve strongly over my lack of that experience. <br/>\n But the birth process only lasts hours, maybe a day or two.  My friend <br/>\nwill forever grieve for her lost child, and I--I get to see mine grow <br/>\nup, and maybe I can be involved in the natural birth of my grandchild.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI wont&#39; say that after 10 weeks or 6 months you get past the section, <br/>\nyou heal.  I dont&#39; believe this. I still have scar tissue pain.  But <br/>\ndespite this, I will say, I can heal from a section.  So yes, give me a <br/>\nsection, and a live baby, please.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\nKerrin or Ralph Taylor wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I was simply determined.

Her first was a normal hospital vaginal birth with an epi.<br/>\nHer second was a natural birth by default (she has quick labors and almost gave birth<br/>\nin the elevator of the hospital). For her 3rd, she figured that she might as well do<br/>\nit at home with a lay midwife (a water birth). Then she decided to be a surrogate and<br/>\nobviously there are few parents who would want to &quot;risk&quot; a homebirth. Plus she got<br/>\npregnant with twins so she researched and found an *absolutely* fantastic ob who was <br/>\nvery hands off and willing (and experienced) with delivering breech babies. She had <br/>\nher lay midwife as a doula (with the blessing of her ob). The hospital had a labor tub<br/>\nbut the &quot;rule&quot; was that you could not deliver in one. So my friend and her doula <br/>\njust kind of planned an &quot;oops&quot; waterbirth. She said that the nurses just about had a fit<br/>\nwhen she refused to get out but her ob was perfectly fine. Unfortunately the 2nd baby<br/>\ngot stuck, they tried a manual version and then were going to try an internal version<br/>\nbut she started hemorrhaging so she had a csection (but for a good reason and after<br/>\ntrying many things). Turns out baby #2 had gotten 1 hand AND 1 foot down into the birth<br/>\ncanal, silly little thing! Before my friend left the hospital she talked with her ob<br/>\nwho said there would be no problem with her going for a vbac next time. :o) She plans<br/>\nto be pregnant for a different couple in the next couple of months.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just find it so funny that she has had just about every type of birth possible. But her<br/>\nbody was meant to birth babies...she has hardly any difficulty during pregnancy and has<br/>\nthese really short labors (I was talking with her at 7pm and she said that she thought that<br/>\nshe might be in labor with her 3rd but I could not tell by listening to her.

The first two I was in labor 24 and 30 hours and<br/>\n&gt;  ended up with c-sections. They suck because you are worn out and exhausted<br/>\n&gt;  before you have major surgery. The third though I had as a VBAC as I was<br/>\n&gt;  very determined that my body could work thru it despite the medical staff!<br/>\n&gt;  I did have an epidural and that was wonderful. <br/>\n&gt;  THe 4th though I ended up with a section again because my water broke and<br/>\n&gt;  24 hours later no contractions.

The first two I was in labor 24 and 30 hours and<br/>\n  ended up with c-sections. They suck because you are worn out and exhausted<br/>\n  before you have major surgery. The third though I had as a VBAC as I was<br/>\n  very determined that my body could work thru it despite the medical staff!<br/>\n  I did have an epidural and that was wonderful. <br/>\n  THe 4th though I ended up with a section again because my water broke and<br/>\n  24 hours later no contractions. The hospital here won&#39;t give you any<br/>\n  pitocin to bring on contractions if you&#39;ve had a previous section so we had<br/>\n  no choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I healed wonderfully with the VBAC but ALSO with the last section. I<br/>\n  checked myself out of the hospital after 2 days and even gave a solstice<br/>\n  party for 15 people 5 days after he was born! I think having the section<br/>\n  with no drain of labor before it made a big difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n  As others have said the big thing is a healthy baby and healthy mom. I<br/>\n  believe part of the healthy mom aspect comes from making informed choices<br/>\n  about the delivery. If that has to include surgery and you have looked at<br/>\n  all the aspects surrounding it then so be it. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I just think it&#39;s frustrating when women opt to have surgery for<br/>\n  convenience or because they just don&#39;t have a clue.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kate<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;&quot;<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;&quot;&quot; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;&quot;&quot;<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; If someone&#39;s baby came out after two hours or eight hours or even 24 hours, <br/>\n  &gt; they still had a vaginal birth and that&#39;s wonderfully lucky and I&#39;m happy<br/>\n  for <br/>\n  &gt; them.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Sandra<br/>\n  &gt;   <br/>\n  &gt;      Yahoo!
