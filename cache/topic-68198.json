Our family is in a financial situation where we are not able to pay for our teens extra curricular activities and our teens are bartering/volunteering for the opportunities to participate in these activities.  This is a blessing for them especially since theatre is one of my teen&#39;s passion.  Since my son is spending a lot of time at the theatre, between the performances, other families let him come along with them to restaurants and ice cream places afterwards.  We do not have the money to pay for all the times that his friends and their families go out to eat.  Therefore, he goes along just to hang out with the group, and then someone seems to always pay for him to eat.  I usually do not go along since I can&#39;t purchase anything either.
