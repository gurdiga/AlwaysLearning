So a peaceful, joyful home where reading is part of everyday life (and a skill which your son will learn when he is ready) and where he can pursue his interests with your help, *is* the better thing to focus on.

That&#39;s good! At this point, they are talking to *you* about his lack of reading. If they start talking to him or about him in his presence, those relationships might then be detrimental to your son. I&#39;d keep an eye on that. And you can be the buffer between them and your son, if necessary. There are ways to stay in touch without regular in-person visits. Keep a blog with pictures and evidence of learning and send it to them, regularly. Call them to tell them about all the cool things you did that day, then say &quot;gotta go&quot; if they get into questioning you. Make the times you do see them full of fun and engagement for you and your son, so there&#39;s little opportunity for them to corner you.<br><br>And your sister is wrong about reading at 15.

Emotionally I get some of it. He needs certain things. You were just talking to me about organization . Don&#39;t you think he will need that and some structure ? You cannot teach him that when he is 15.
