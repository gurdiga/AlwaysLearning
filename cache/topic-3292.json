So where do you draw the line then, on<br/>\nchoices in your life, what you are willing to be exposed to and expose your<br/>\nfamily to?  Are there no lines in your life at all?  Is anything that exists<br/>\nfair game for your family?  How about dangerous things that are hard to<br/>\nargue about like heroin?***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not Sandra, but I do definitely draw the line at my 7 year old taking<br/>\nheroin. I&#39;m sure she would learn something from it, but I am unreasonably<br/>\nadamant.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce again: drug use is illegal. Television is not. That&#39;s one big<br/>\ndifference.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*** If you do have lines in your life are you the pot<br/>\ncalling the kettle black because you are criticizing me for having different<br/>\nlines than you.***<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are letting your children use heroin, you betcha I&#39;m sitting in<br/>\njudgment of you.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra said: ***You can say that, but by banning it from your house, you are<br/>\nsaying it is a<br/>\nvery bad thing, bad for babies, bad for children, unnatural, harmful.***<br/>\n<br/>\nShe said it about television, you&#39;re comparing it to heroin. So please tell<br/>\nme what part of that quote you have a problem applying to heroin use or<br/>\nabuse. I ban it from my house. If my child asked, I would tell her it&#39;s bad<br/>\nfor babies and children.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***Is there no<br/>\ndifference between saying I do not like a &quot;thing&quot; (tv) for example, and<br/>\npassing a judgement on another persons choice to have a tv?***<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, there&#39;s a big difference. I can say, &quot;I don&#39;t like cauliflower&quot; and<br/>\nyou can say, &quot;Really? I love cauliflower&quot; and this is neither of us being<br/>\njudgmental of the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH, I could say, &quot;I don&#39;t like cauliflower. I will also not allow my<br/>\nchildren to eat it because a group over there says it causes sinus upset and<br/>\nI hear Hitler loved cauliflower&quot; and you, as a cauliflower-eating person,<br/>\nmight feel I was judging you as not caring about your children&#39;s sinuses and<br/>\npossible future as Nazis.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think anyone here cares if you or I like TV. There is a concept<br/>\ncalled unschooling and I (and others) have been arguing that by not trusting<br/>\nchildren to make their own decisions about TV we do them a disservice in the<br/>\npursuit of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***It may be that tv free parents are not free to converse with<br/>\neach other on this list***<br/>\n<br/>\nThey absolutely are, as long as by &quot;free&quot; you don&#39;t mean &quot;free from anyone<br/>\nelse challenging their ideas&quot;. If you DO mean that, it&#39;s a matter for<br/>\nprivate e-mail, or maybe an no-TV support list.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3291,"nextTopicId":3062}}
