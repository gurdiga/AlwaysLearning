We got the game and then Margaux&#39;s computer crashed.  So, we will probably install it tomorrow.  We&#39;ve talked a little about centrifugal force and we swung buckets of water upside down in a circle so Margaux (7) could see how the water stays in the bucket just like people stay in the roller coaster when it goes upside down.
