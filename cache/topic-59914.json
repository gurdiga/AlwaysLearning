She said, &quot;hey you could just take us all the way and stay and <br/>\nhang out with us.

They need a parent,&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a tragic dichotomy that one little line sets up!<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery single time that line has ever entered my head, it was leading me<br/>\nin the wrong direction. Every time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is a friend? I&#39;m not talking about the schoolmates teenagers go out<br/>\npartying and drinking with. Not talking about the 5 year old kid your<br/>\nchild happens to play with at the park that day. I&#39;m talking about real<br/>\nfriendship.<br/>\n<br/>\n1 a*:* one attached to another by affection or esteem<br/>\n<br/>\nKnowing what I know now, with my kids grown, I strongly feel that that<br/>\nthat one line, which permeates parental consciousnesses, should be<br/>\nquickly and actively contradicted and rooted out like a pernicious weed<br/>\nevery single time it sprouts up.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of &quot;You&#39;re the parent, not their friend,&quot; substitute, &quot;Be the<br/>\nvery very best friend to them you can possibly be.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDo your kids need you to be their &quot;40 year old friend?&quot; YES! Children do<br/>\nneed to feel attached to their parents &quot;by affection or esteem.&quot; What<br/>\nbetter connection is there than by affection and esteem?<br/>\n<br/>\nAND, what&#39;s more, parents need their children&#39;s friendship, too. Some<br/>\npeople seem to think there is something wrong with parents &quot;needing&quot;<br/>\ntheir children. They act like being mutually attached to each other<br/>\nmeans children have not become independent enough and parents are being<br/>\na &quot;burden to their children.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nA 40 year old friend isn&#39;t going to have the same relationship with a 5<br/>\nyear old as his/her 5 year old friends or 10 year old friends. And<br/>\nparent-child friendships evolve over the years until they are,<br/>\neventually, adult-with-adult friendships.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is nothing wrong with wanting to be your child&#39;s friend. Do what<br/>\nit takes to earn their friendship - be supportive and kind and honest<br/>\nand trustworthy and caring and generous and loyal and fun and<br/>\ninteresting and interested in them and all the other things that good<br/>\nfriends are to each other. Be the best 40 year old friend you can be (or<br/>\nwhatever age you are).<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople use &quot;I&#39;m the parent, not a friend,&quot; as an excuse to be mean,<br/>\nselfish, and lazy. Instead, be the adult in the friendship. Be mature.<br/>\nYou&#39;ve BEEN a five-year-old and your child has not been a<br/>\nforty-year-old, so you have an advantage in terms of long-term and wider<br/>\nperspective. Use that advantage to be an even better friend. You know<br/>\nhow to be kinder and less self-centered and you know how beneficial it<br/>\nis to put forth the effort.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can honestly say that my children and I are friends. I know they&#39;d say<br/>\nthe same. I&#39;m not trying to act like I&#39;m 18 or 21 or 24 -- I am 57 years<br/>\nold. They&#39;re having a &quot;Halo&quot; party at someone else&#39;s house tonight and<br/>\nwill stay up all night playing video games and I&#39;m not going to go and<br/>\nhang out with them all night and play Halo. I&#39;m going to make a huge<br/>\nplatter of deviled eggs for them to take over there, but I&#39;m going to<br/>\nstay home and watch a movie with my husband and go to bed early enough<br/>\nthat I&#39;ll feel good tomorrow. I&#39;m not 18 and I don&#39;t recover as quickly<br/>\nas they do from a night with no sleep. I didn&#39;t go to the midnight<br/>\nshowing of the Terminator movie the other night, for the same reason.<br/>\nBut I was certainly invited and welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are not spoiled brats because I&#39;ve tried to be their friend.<br/>\nThey hold jobs, they manage money, they make good and responsible<br/>\ndecisions. We are very strongly &quot;attached by affection and esteem.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I could wipe that expression out of everybody&#39;s minds and replace<br/>\nit with &quot;Be the best friend to your children that you can be.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Pam Sorooshian<br/>\n-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\npeace,<br/>\nCaren</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] how do kids learn self control?","postDate":"1298296415","msgId":59942,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFBMkZENzgyLUU0NzktNDk5MC1CRkM3LTBGQUM2MzAyMDVCMkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDZFMDlBOTQwLTlERUMtNEVGQy1BNzYyLUU5Qjc4NzVGQ0Y3OUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGlqcnJwNCs2dnNlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NkUwOUE5NDAtOURFQy00RUZDLUE3NjItRTlCNzg3NUZDRjc5QHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":59938,"nextInTopic":59964,"prevInTime":59941,"nextInTime":59943,"topicId":59914,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Drive by David Pink http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc Daniel Pink.

And they do it not because they lack self control or  <br/>\ndiscipline but because they&#39;ve felt controlled all their lives and  <br/>\nthey&#39;re, in a knee jerk way, fighting anything that feels like  <br/>\ncontrol. People who feel they have control in their lives don&#39;t need  <br/>\nto constantly fight for it or fight against other people having some.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Director Linda Owen says the children are expected to be responsible  <br/>\n&gt; for a series of actions when they arrive at school each morning,  <br/>\n&gt; without help from Mom and Dad. The children sign in, put away their  <br/>\n&gt; lunches, hang up their own clothes, wash their hands before they can  <br/>\n&gt; play, and then choose activities in the classroom.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;All those things help with self-management,&quot; Owen says.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I suspect the kids are experiencing a much different reality!<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think they were driven by a lofty desire for self control but  <br/>\nby a desire to be competent.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 4 being able to follow rules like in a game can feel like an  <br/>\naccomplishment. It&#39;s like needing to jump Mario from the box to the  <br/>\nledge while missing the cactus each time you enter a particular level.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut also, emotions are powerful and it feels like they make you do  <br/>\nthings you don&#39;t necessarily want to. At 4 experiencing the ability to  <br/>\nseize control from an emotion is undoubtedly a big deal. Being able to  <br/>\nstop that impulse to rush into the room in order to do something first  <br/>\n-- as, importantly, other kids were doing -- might feel like a  <br/>\ndiscovery of power for some kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it&#39;s not a drive to *self* control but a broader more general drive  <br/>\nto feel more competent and more in control. (Or less out of control. A  <br/>\nfeeling of not always needing to be a slave to the whims of emotion.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has been going around for a while, and if you haven&#39;t taken the  <br/>\ntime to watch it, you&#39;ve been missing something good!

And that&#39;s how undoubtedly  <br/>\nmost schools would end up implementing such ideas. The goal would be  <br/>\nto make kids obey rules instead of their inner voice. To do what  <br/>\nsomeone else tells them to instead of what they want to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For example, preschoolers can learn that they don&#39;t always get what  <br/>\n&gt; they want immediately; they may need to wait for that treat.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Preschoolers can have reinforced how little power they have in the  <br/>\nworld and how it must rock to be big so you can make other people do  <br/>\nwhat you want them to do. Or even go so far as to make them jump  <br/>\nthrough hoops that make no sense.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Parents can help teenagers learn self-control by making sure the  <br/>\n&gt; family has clear rules for things like curfew or finishing homework  <br/>\n&gt; before they have screen time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If the choice is &quot;Do whatever,&quot; or &quot;Here&#39;s a few clear expectations  <br/>\nand the consequences,&quot; then &quot;Here&#39;s our expectations,&quot; will have more  <br/>\npositive effects.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that&#39;s not optimal. It doesn&#39;t help kids make better decisions. It  <br/>\njust controls them until they&#39;re older and their point of view and  <br/>\nemotions become more adult like.

Terrie Moffitt says at ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1939726043\">The author is trying to pin the work being done in the Clara Barton daycare on <br/>\nthe findings being presented in Terrie Moffitt&#39;s study. Terrie Moffitt says at <br/>\nthe beginning of the article &quot;Children who had the greatest self-control in <br/>\nprimary school and  preschool ages were most likely to have fewer health <br/>\nproblems when they  reached their 30s.&quot; She doesn&#39;t say where they got their <br/>\nself-control. She doesn&#39;t say what helps or hinders the production of <br/>\nself-control. She says those folks who have self control at age x do better at <br/>\nage y. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the abstract of the paper the authors state their findings have sweeping <br/>\nbenefits for the public. It is important to know that funding for research in <br/>\nthe UK (apparently the U.S. started it, so there too) is demanding that there be <br/>\na public good outcome. Blue sky research is not considered valuable. Only that <br/>\nresearch which will have public policy contributions will go more easily to <br/>\nbeing funded. In the face of that researchers may be prone to overstating the <br/>\napplicability to the individual and the group when writing up their findings. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the abstract, in direct contradiction of the idea that learning is what is <br/>\nkey to self control, the authors write: &quot;In another cohort of 500 sibling-pairs, <br/>\nthe sibling with                      lower self-control had poorer outcomes, <br/>\ndespite  shared family background.&quot; It argues that shared environment isn&#39;t what <br/>\nproduces self-control. It argues that it is something genetic and on a spectrum, <br/>\nor gradient as the authors term it. I don&#39;t know if they did any birth order <br/>\nanalyses, but I think those kinds of analyses may be relatively unlikely to come <br/>\nto significance anyhow. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the daycare setup sounds more like operant conditioning than it  sounds <br/>\nlike working to create an environment where learning self control  is more <br/>\nlikely. &quot;The two teachers give the children multiple cues when it&#39;s time to <br/>\nclean  up: Lights flash, a bell rings and the children clap and count to 100.  <br/>\nThat makes it easier to switch gears without a meltdown.&quot; That just speaks of <br/>\nSkinnerian psychological practices. Maybe that is what they mean by <br/>\nself-control, maybe if you haven&#39;t got it you should fake it is the model that <br/>\nthey are hoping will work. If you can be given rituals to perform that get you <br/>\nto wait for 100 seconds you, too, can have self control?<br/>\n<br/>\nThen the end of the article makes no sense at all:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Parents can help teenagers learn  self-control by making sure the family has <br/>\nclear rules for things like  curfew or finishing homework before they have <br/>\nscreen time. Teenager who  have problems with impulsivity may benefit from <br/>\nspecial driving classes  that let them practice controlling the car in difficult <br/>\nconditions on a  racetrack. For all teens, clear rules such as curfews help them <br/>\nregulate  themselves.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow is that about self-control? How is that about anything other than <br/>\ntraditional parenting practices. Other than the racetrack thing, which sounds <br/>\nlike fun. The article just went from external control methods being used in <br/>\ndaycare to external control methods being used with teenagers. Nothing <br/>\nparticularly valuable. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the problems with the belief that if you don&#39;t have it by preschool age <br/>\nyou won&#39;t get it is that school is a huge culturally defining factor in many <br/>\nsocieties&#39; group experiences. Linnaea may (or may not) have looked as though she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have much self-control by the age of 3 or 4. She wanted what she wanted <br/>\nwhen she wanted it. At 10 she looks very different. Having had her needs met and <br/>\nher interests supported she&#39;s very capable of really examining what she wants <br/>\nand how long she&#39;s willing to wait for something or how much she&#39;s willing to <br/>\npay. She hasn&#39;t had to compete with 20 to 30 other children on a daily basis to <br/>\nget her needs met. She hasn&#39;t had a life that is largely not about her needs <br/>\nbeing met. The children in the Clara Barton daycare in Cabin John, MD may be <br/>\nbetter off than the children at a less enlightened and modern daycare down the <br/>\nroad, or in the next town, but they aren&#39;t better off than their unschooled <br/>\npeers who are being supported and nurtured and not pushed to independent hand <br/>\nwashing with pictorial guide by age 4. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: rubixscuba &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rebecca@...\">rebecca@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nanyway, i would love to hear a bit about what your take is on this article and <br/>\nthe message. here is the link:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.npr.org/2011/02/14/133629477/for-kids-self-control-factors-into-future-success&sc=nl&cc=es-20110220\">http://www.npr.org/2011/02/14/133629477/for-kids-self-control-factors-into-future-success&sc=nl&cc=es-20110220</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":416377114,"authorName":"rubixscuba","from":"&quot;rubixscuba&quot; &lt;rebecca@...&gt;","profile":"rubixscuba","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"how do kids learn self control?","postDate":"1298231908","msgId":59914,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlqcnJwNCs2dnNlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":59930,"prevInTime":59913,"nextInTime":59915,"topicId":59914,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"i found this article really interesting right now as i am starting to question mainstream ideas such as rules (no dessert till after dinner, having curfews, no","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-995427878\">i found this article really interesting right now as i am starting to question mainstream ideas such as rules (no dessert till after dinner, having curfews, no TV till after homework is done etc etc) and of course the idea that parents and teachers need to TEACH kids how to be in the world so that they will be successful adults. <br/>\n<br/>\nit really got me thinking about how some (most?) parents send their kids to school to learn &quot;how to be&quot; in the world. i think there are schools out there that try to create an enriched, stimulating environment for the kids to learn in. and there are parents who work 9-5 everyday away from their kids and then at home things are in fact LESS interesting than at school (often just a routine of eating dinner, doing homework, getting ready for bed + maybe some fun/family time on the weekend).... i know i used to be a part of that rat race myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nit seems to me that the daycare mentioned in the article has some positive ideas, such as cue cards that remind the kids how to get along (instead of constant verbal directives or reprimands from teachers) and involving the kids in the solutions to problems that arise (instead of time-outs and forced apologies). those things seem to me very different than blanket rules, like what is suggested for parents to do at home. <br/>\n<br/>\nit&#39;s a bit frightening to hear such messages about future success depending on self control when you don&#39;t feel like you have enough tools to help your kids learn. i think some parents probably read this and think they need to force their kids to clean up their blocks &quot;or else&quot; at a young age...<br/>\n<br/>\ni&#39;d also like to read the actual study and see how they measured all those variables such as self control and success, and whether they investigated how this was &quot;taught to&quot; (ie learned by) the kids. and whether success = happiness.<br/>\n<br/>\nanyway, i would love to hear a bit about what your take is on this article and the message. here is the link:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.npr.org/2011/02/14/133629477/for-kids-self-control-factors-into-future-success&sc=nl&cc=es-20110220\">http://www.npr.org/2011/02/14/133629477/for-kids-self-control-factors-into-future-success&sc=nl&cc=es-20110220</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59456,"nextTopicId":59891}}
