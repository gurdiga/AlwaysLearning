We&#39;ve put quite a bit of effort into trying to help her meet others with her interests and values - she&#39;s joined a church choir, participated in some of that church&#39;s offerings for youth including joining the &quot;High School Youth Group&quot; and she takes dance lessons at a local studio and art lessons geared towards teen artists at our local art museum.  Still, the in-person connections aren&#39;t being made quickly and solidly enough for her satisfaction.  She knows that she is able to participate in extra-curricular clubs and activities at our local school without becoming a full-time enrolled student next year (it&#39;s too late to &#39;dual-enroll&#39; her for this school year.) <br/>\n<br/>\nShe has a couple good long-distance friends that she skypes and texts with.  We&#39;ve traveled great distances to get her to be able to spend time with them in person but it&#39;s not enough to meet her needs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe has also been thinking and talking about wanting to go to college in a few years.  She knows, having watched her older brother do it, that she doesn&#39;t need to attend high-school to be able to go to college, but she says she wants &quot;more education.&quot;  Part of what I think we&#39;ll talk about is the option of doing more school-like learning from home and/or ways to advance her knowledge and skills outside of the traditional schooling methods. <br/>\n<br/>\nAdvice?<br/>\n<br/>\nChris</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69595,"nextTopicId":69623}}
