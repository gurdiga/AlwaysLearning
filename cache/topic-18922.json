He started college here in San Diego at community college.  When he <br/>\ngot a summer diving job in Houston he stayed on there to work, and finished his <br/>\nlower division at a community college there, to then transfer to Clarion <br/>\nbecause of the diving program (he went on to become the Nat. Champion on both the 1 <br/>\nand 3 meter boards for them both years he was there).  He applied to U of <br/>\nIrvine, and UCSD out here, then NYU, then UCLA and USD.  He said he would only <br/>\nnot take the UCLA offer if he were to get into the USC program.  For that one <br/>\nyou work one year here in San Diego with the Old Globe Theatre, and then go to <br/>\nLondon for the second year, to work with a Shakespearean company.  Only about <br/>\nthree people get accepted to that program.  He doesn&#39;t think it will be him!  <br/>\n<br/>\nActually, he had pretty much decided because of such limited numbers being <br/>\naccepted, he had a whole back-up plan to go to Hollywood and try to find work - <br/>\nto try that for a year, and if that didn&#39;t work out, then apply to &quot;lesser&quot; <br/>\nknown schools for their grad programs.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeedless to say he is flying high after getting accepted.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust wanted to mention he didn&#39;t start college until he turned 21 - when he <br/>\ncould continue to get health insurance IF he was a full-time student, and going <br/>\nto school was cheaper than health insurance!!<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the FULL story on Shawn and his siblings you can purchase my book <br/>\n-HOMESCHOOLING REFLECTIONS!  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust go to www.homeschoolingreflections.com, and place your order now!!!  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18921,"nextTopicId":18923}}
