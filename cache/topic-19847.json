(Maybe I&#39;ll get to even hear  a <br/>\nwhole speech!)<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nBut Kathryn did ask me to be in charge of the raffle, so here&#39;s my  pitch!<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nThe first year&#39;s raffle was pretty cool, but it was mostly stuff I&#39;d begged  <br/>\nfor on the street---along with a few surprises that stole the show..<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nLast year&#39;s was absolutely incredible! Gorgeous one-of-a-kind pieces of  art, <br/>\nquilts, books, games, toys, humor (Heidi&#39;s get-out-of-hell-free card was a  <br/>\nscream!), food (I won the box of potatoes!), t-shirts, handmade  socks----and <br/>\nother special items that only unschoolers could come up with! That  back table <br/>\nwas literally crammed with items---some even hanging from the  ceiling!<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m asking for you to dig deep again! Please help make this one the best  <br/>\nyet! The money from the raffle goes to help cover scholarships.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf you can&#39;t make the conference, you can still participate: you can send  <br/>\nyour donation to me or to Kathryn. Our addresses are below.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf you&#39;re coming but don&#39;t want to haul it long distance, you may send them  <br/>\nahead by August 1 to me or Kathryn. Otherwise, please just drop them  by the <br/>\nraffle table as soon as you&#39;ve registered. We&#39;ll be looking for  you!<br/>\n <br/>\nIf the item has a &quot;story&quot;, please include it---it&#39;s nice to know more  about <br/>\nits donor or its origins.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m excitedly looking forward to what y&#39;all spring on me this year!<br/>\n <br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\n118 Steeplechase South<br/>\nColumbia, SC 29209-4810<br/>\n <br/>\nKathryn Baptista<br/>\n26 Phillips Street<br/>\nSalem, MA 01970<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks so much! <br/>\n <br/>\nKelly, Raffle Coordinator (whew!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19846,"nextTopicId":19849}}
