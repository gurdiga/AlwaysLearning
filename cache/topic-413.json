I tried out more than a few suggestions today and find myself with more energy and optimism than I have had in a while! So many of you really gave me food for thought and helped me to just get my act together. Thanks especially to Mary (and the others of you who responded on unschooling.dotcom so soon after I lost my dad when I was floundering terribly) for the sympathy. My dad was supposed to be a huge part of our unschooling journey with his wide-ranging knowledge, his infectious love of discovery, and his willingness to be the biggest kid around...*I* wanted to learn with him again...Ah, well, at least I have a clearer view ahead of me now with my immediate concerns about the bad vibes to/from my really great children. Thanks!<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":383,"nextTopicId":356}}
