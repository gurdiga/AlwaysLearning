So, if you picture humans in a longhouse or whatever big weather-protective, community shelter, the mom, dad, and kids are all together with grandma and grandpa and aunts and uncles as you move down the row to inlaws or less related individuals. Of course pre-agriculture is 10,000 years ago. Serious change in a species has been shown to occur in 40 generations, so if you assume 25 years for a generation (birth to reproductive) it is arguable that humans have changed from pre-agricultural adaptations to post-agricultural adaptations, 10 times over. If living away from family, farming your own patch and living nearer to it, gave you better returns and lower mortality and higher reproductive rates, than moving from extended kin longhouses to more isolated households is certainly going to be selected for. We moved, at a<br/>\n rush, from the country to the city. We seriously believed that the city was going to give us a better return than the country was. Moving from the country moved us away from our extended kin networks. We moved to isolation. Of course we often took our cultural identities with us, the food we loved, moved to the neighborhoods that was most filled with folks from our part of the world, the clothes we wore. We like to be a part of a group. I assume because being a part of a group gives us an advantage over being all by ourselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;m no help whatsoever. <br/>\n<br/>\nI read Sandra&#39;s response first. My mom sends me these fantastic diaries from women, often teachers to start, who lived in Minnesota and South Dakota in the 1800&#39;s and life was really fairly social then. I think I am stuck in an Old Jules view of the early settlers that makes me think it is all like the Mosquito Coast . <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Pam Tellew &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamtellew@...\">pamtellew@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Monday, 26 January, 2009 5:23:56 PM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Feeling Isolated<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&lt;&lt;Kids have grown up on ranches and science stations (Sunspot, New<br/>\n&gt;Mexico) and pioneers of various sorts and missionaries have survived<br/>\n&gt;for years in relative isolation and some of their kids did<br/>\n&gt;wonderfully well.

They book a band, organize the dances, book speakers and plan workshops for the teens at the conference. Tamzin&#39;s on the TCC this year for the first time and she&#39;s excited about it.

She<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t bother with these kids, now.  Others in the neighborhood are<br/>\nmore accepting and just want to get down to the business of playing!<br/>\n <br/>\nAre you just looking for an unschooling group, specifically or would a<br/>\ngroup of homeschoolers suffice?  We have a couple of schooled friends in<br/>\nthe neighborhood and at ballet class, some unschooled friends, and some<br/>\nhomeschooled (school-at-home) friends.  I think what helps is to go<br/>\nafter interests.  My girls like to ride horses, take ballet, bowl with a<br/>\nhomeschool group (small), play at the park, attend a cool science class<br/>\nonce a month at an environmental research center, arrange playdates, go<br/>\nto a homeschool P.E. class, go to a homeschool open gym at a gymnastics<br/>\nplace, etc.  I might get to talking with a mom or they might come out<br/>\nfrom the activity and say &quot;Can you talk to so-and-so&#39;s mom and arrange a<br/>\nplaydate for us?&quot;.  Now, my elder gal is the extrovert while my younger<br/>\nis the introvert, so I find a difference in how many friends they want<br/>\nand want to play with at a time.  <br/>\n <br/>\nJoin some local Yahoo groups and homeschool groups and post about<br/>\ngetting together based on interest and/or age.  Keep at it, it will<br/>\nclick!<br/>\n <br/>\nAlso, I find that just having certain activities on certain days each<br/>\nweek is really helpful.  The girls know that Monday we might go ice<br/>\nskating (just us! :-)), Tuesday is riding, Wed. is open gym and later<br/>\nballet, Thursday is riding again, Friday I babysit three unschooled boys<br/>\n(brothers) and we all go to the homeschool P.E. class in the winter and<br/>\nthe park in the warmer months.  We usually fit in playdates before or<br/>\nafter these activities or just lay low at home until it&#39;s time for the<br/>\nactivity (or run errands!).  If $ is a concern, park days are free and<br/>\neven just two activities a week can be a real boost and a way to meet<br/>\nothers.<br/>\n <br/>\nBest wishes,<br/>\n~Melissa :-)<br/>\n <br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of krissy8444<br/>\nSent: Thursday, January 22, 2009 1:40 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Feeling Isolated<br/>\n <br/>\nHi Unschoolers,<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been unschooling for about 4 yrs now after I pulled my children<br/>\nout of school and read <br/>\nJohn Holt.
