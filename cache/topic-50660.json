When I make decisions based on what I think is best, regardless of what the other person may really prefer, that can be disempowering.

Since the people reading here have for the most part, chosen to unschool, part and parcel of that choice is giving kids more choices, not less, giving as many as possible for the individual child and what they are capable of.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust like when my babies were infants, I put clothing on them and chose what those things were, I also chose to breastfeed, and I also chose to listen to their hunger cues, thereby giving them the choice of when to eat.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiving my kids choices is a gift that I&#39;m giving them.
