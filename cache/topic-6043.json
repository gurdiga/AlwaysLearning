I always used<br/>\nCarefresh for bedding, and the California breeders recommended it, but<br/>\nwe did have a couple of respiratory issues, so I&#39;ll look into aspen<br/>\nshavings when we start again.  I live in VA, but I had an almost<br/>\nimpossible time finding any local breeders, so I called CA everytime I<br/>\nhad a major question.  I did finally find 2 semi-local breeders for when<br/>\nwe get more rats.  We never had a problem with our male rats fighting<br/>\nwith each other, but the breeders told me we were lucky on that score.<br/>\nOh, it&#39;s nice to find other rat fans!  I get so tired of people where I<br/>\nlive being so grossed out by them.  I subscribe to AFRMA&#39;s magazine, and<br/>\nit has really interesting rat information in it.<br/>\n <br/>\nLaurel in Burke, VA<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: freeform@...
