I think they are both unable and choosing not to, <br/>\ndepending on the particular instance.  They do also have an active <br/>\ntwo year old boy to chase after.  I couldn&#39;t help physically <br/>\ncringing as I listened to my brother, last weekend, forcing his 8 <br/>\nyear old into bed in her tent with her sister.  She said &quot;But I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to go to bed yet..etc&quot; crying.  He responds angrily &quot;I <br/>\ndon&#39;t CARE what you want, I told you to...&quot; bla bla<br/>\n<br/>\nListening to children takes time, and effort, and patience, and <br/>\nrespect for them as equal human beings not your property.  It&#39;s not <br/>\nas easy on the surface as ordering them about.  I think therin lies <br/>\nthe root of this problem.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Thomas would actually be happy to include Aidan (and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; has numerous times) if he had time and assistance to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mediate incorporating him into a game.  ==<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then are you able to provide that mediation, for Thomas&#39; sake?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I try to, but I can&#39;t be everywhere and Thomas literally runs all <br/>\nover.  I try to keep myself nearby, which is how I often witness <br/>\nthis stuff, but they are so quick to start scolding, issuing <br/>\nultimatums, etc.  I can still try to mediate after the ultimatums <br/>\nare issued, sort of ignoring them or pretending they are not there, <br/>\nbut the kids all still heard them.  I don&#39;t allow them to verbally <br/>\nabuse my son, so they issue their ultimatums to their own <br/>\ngirls, &quot;You can&#39;t play with Thomas for a while (or) until..&quot;  making <br/>\nhim the bad guy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMainly I try to help mediate, but I have to be fast, verbally and <br/>\nphysically.  Even then the other adults (my own father and Aidan&#39;s <br/>\nmother being the worst culprits) will sometimes not allow the time <br/>\nfor that to happen (by talking over me to say &quot;No, we&#39;re not <br/>\ncompromising, Aidan gets to play too, or play with what you have or <br/>\nwhere you are..&quot;) and my efforts go by the wayside.  Other times <br/>\nthey just mutter amongst themselves about the latest precieved mini-<br/>\natrocity they think Thomas is guilty of.<br/>\n<br/>\nOften the best strategy is for me to play with Aidan and give him <br/>\nsomething to do until the other kids have worked out a solution, <br/>\nwhisking him away from the scene and offering him various options <br/>\nand calming him down.  He really is a sweet kid, I just think they <br/>\nare teaching him that throwing tantrums at the least provocation is <br/>\na good way to deal with things.  If he is really determined to play <br/>\nwith the other kids (often he&#39;s happier to do something with me) <br/>\nthen we will return when all are calm and I facilitate that.  I <br/>\ncan&#39;t control what the other adults do during this time however.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s really not fair for Thomas&#39; choices to be a) excluded from <br/>\n&gt;play altogether or b) forced to always play a social role past his <br/>\n&gt;own ability.  And to be shamed no matter what.  I know you know <br/>\n&gt;this, from the tone of your email.  So what can you do to make sure <br/>\n&gt;he is not put into that situation again?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Right, I completely agree.  I don&#39;t know the solution.  This is my <br/>\ndilema.  They seem not to absorb the information I tell them about <br/>\nThomas, the discussions we have about his limitations or <br/>\ndifficulties.  They are dismissive of my attempts to explain what I <br/>\nsee happening between him and Aidan and why I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as <br/>\nthey see it.  They believe I am merely being defensive of Thomas, <br/>\neven though they know that he&#39;s autistic and has other &quot;special <br/>\nneeds&quot;, and even though my sister-in-law has a high functioning <br/>\nautistic younger brother.  They know it, but they don&#39;t act like the <br/>\nknow it, if you know what I mean.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to start a war with my brother and his wife and have <br/>\nthem punish me by not allowing their kids to see us.  Thomas adores <br/>\nhis cousins and I can&#39;t decide for him that we won&#39;t see them, as he <br/>\nwould be desperately sad.  I try to get them to send at least their <br/>\nolder two out for visits (we live 5-6 hours away) but so far have <br/>\nbeen unsuccessful.  School rules their lives and they won&#39;t allow <br/>\nthem to miss even part of a day for a visit and they make excuses in <br/>\nthe summer.  This camping trip happens once a year and we see them a <br/>\ncouple other times, maybe, during the year.

There were no problem&#39;s at all, except tears when they <br/>\nsaid goodbye.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy brother is bringing all four of his kids out to our area for a 4 <br/>\nday camping trip in early September and we will be going with them <br/>\nand are very hopeful that without his wife and our father around we <br/>\ncan make some kind of inroads into understanding between us.  I feel <br/>\nthat the main problem is not between the kids, but with the other <br/>\nadults poor reactions to the situation with the kids.  With a better <br/>\nadult reaction it would turn into a non or at least very small <br/>\nissue, and Aidan and Thomas, I believe, would find their way to <br/>\ncommunication and understanding between them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you feel you must (or want to) keep seeing this family, and you<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t constantly interpret for Thomas, can your visits at least be <br/>\n&gt;in a situation where you and Thomas can leave when he needs to, so <br/>\n&gt;he can regroup and reconnect again?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We had out tent placed at a distance from the group camp of 15 <br/>\npeople specifically for this reason.  The problem is that Thomas <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to leave and regroup, can&#39;t read his own needs and <br/>\nfeelings well, is excited and worked up playing with his other <br/>\ncousins, and we end up having to make him do it as gently as <br/>\npossible (some of the necessary structure with him I discussed.)  It <br/>\nstill helps to be at a distance like that, but difficult to convince <br/>\nhim to utilize that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Can you have a good NVC talk with your SIL, recognizing that she<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t want her son to be left out, but letting her know that <br/>\n&gt;Thomas&#39; limits are real (we all have limits) and they need to be <br/>\n&gt;respected?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Our discussions thus far have not been formal, but maybe that is <br/>\nwhat needs to happen in order to help this situation and get them to <br/>\ntake what I say seriously.  It&#39;s definately an idea worth <br/>\ncontemplating.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If that doesn&#39;t work, can you keep visits with this family short <br/>\n&gt;for a few years?  In time, all these kids will mature, including <br/>\n&gt;Thomas, and the situation will be easier.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Two to four day visits about three times a year seems pretty short <br/>\nto me.  If you mean several hour visits instead, that doesn&#39;t seem <br/>\npossible, given that it takes 5-6 hours just to travel between our <br/>\nhomes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Speaking for myself, I would not put my son in a situation where he<br/>\n&gt; was asked to do more than he could and then made to feel shame <br/>\n&gt;when he couldn&#39;t.  <br/>\n&gt; Amy<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We agonize for months every year over whether we should go on this <br/>\n4th of July trip or not.  So far the benefits have outweighed the <br/>\ndetractors but not a huge amount.  Overall the kids remember playing <br/>\nwith their cousins and all the fun stuff.  They unequivocally vote <br/>\nto go every year (as in &quot;Of COURSE Mom!  We HAVE to go!&quot;)  I want <br/>\nthem to have this opportunity and the good memories.  The girls (my <br/>\n8 and 10 year old neices) both told me several times that it was <br/>\ntheir favorite time all year.  It&#39;s us adults who seem to suffer <br/>\nmore and are hesitant about going.  Our 19 year old (my neice whom I <br/>\nraised as a young child and who&#39;s lived with us for several years <br/>\nnow) chose not to go this year even though she really wanted to see <br/>\nthe little ones, specifically to avoid the other adults besides us. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for taking the time to answer in such depth.

I didn&#39;t &quot;make them,&quot; and didn&#39;t ask them to.   She got old enough <br/>\nthat they wanted her there.   The other night they were all getting together <br/>\nand one of the boys (a homeschooled 16 year old) needed to go and get his older <br/>\nsister from their house in another town.   He offered to take Holly with him.  <br/>\n Then when they had her they were going to meet up with Marty and three <br/>\nothers at an all night restaurant.      I let her go.   The next morning Holly said <br/>\nit had been really nice that he had taken her because they were having fun, <br/>\nnot just because he didn&#39;t want to dump her.   (He was at the house and Kirby <br/>\nleft, then Marty left, and he was still involved in doing something with <br/>\nHolly.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if we ever &quot;made&quot; people include the younger, that couldn&#39;t have <br/>\nhappened.

Does anyone force or enforce older<br/>\n&gt; siblings (or cousins) having to play with and include<br/>\n&gt; younger kids in whatever they want to be included in?<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone have any thoughts on the possible<br/>\n&gt; repercussions of this?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My sister-in-law and brother seem to think it&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; wonderful thing that they &quot;make all (their) kids play<br/>\n&gt; together.&quot;  What that really means is that if the<br/>\n&gt; younger children, their four year old boy Aidan in<br/>\n&gt; particular because he&#39;s the most demanding of their<br/>\n&gt; two younger children, want to get into a game or<br/>\n&gt; activity of the older kids, he MUST be accomodated or<br/>\n&gt; the older children will be punished.  If he wants to<br/>\n&gt; be left alone with what he&#39;s doing however, they must<br/>\n&gt; accomodate that as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My older son Thomas (8) has trouble with this boy, not<br/>\n&gt; because he dislikes him, because he actually likes him<br/>\n&gt; a lot.  Aidan&#39;s actually a very clever and sweet child<br/>\n&gt; with much of the same interests as Thomas.  The first<br/>\n&gt; thing Thomas did when we arrived was to run and show<br/>\n&gt; Aidan his bionicle toys.  Thomas has trouble because<br/>\n&gt; he is not flexible enough to immediately wrap his mind<br/>\n&gt; around adjusting the game/play to include this rather<br/>\n&gt; demading and sensative four year old, who is also a<br/>\n&gt; LOT like Thomas himself (not a comparison I can make<br/>\n&gt; in front of Aidan&#39;s parents.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thomas also has trouble because Aidan wants to lead<br/>\n&gt; the play and must be dealt with in a gentle and<br/>\n&gt; politic way to avoid tantrums.  Aidan also, like most<br/>\n&gt; toddlers, wants whatever you have and to be wherever<br/>\n&gt; you are, just because you have it and are there.<br/>\n&gt; Thomas is not known for his subtlety or patience and<br/>\n&gt; has trouble communicating what he means in a socially<br/>\n&gt; acceptable way and a way that will appease this little<br/>\n&gt; cousin.  They misunderstand each other and lose<br/>\n&gt; patience with each other a lot.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The invariable result of all this is that my<br/>\n&gt; sister-in-law calls her girls over and tells them they<br/>\n&gt; cannot play with Thomas if he will not include Aidan.<br/>\n&gt; Thomas would actually be happy to include Aidan (and<br/>\n&gt; has numerous times) if he had time and assistance to<br/>\n&gt; mediate incorporating him into a game.  Aidan throws a<br/>\n&gt; tantrum at any sign of resistance or wrong word or<br/>\n&gt; action from Thomas and then Aidan&#39;s parents step in<br/>\n&gt; with ultimatums or just shortcut to scolding my son.<br/>\n&gt; When I have a chance to step in instead I can mediate<br/>\n&gt; them successfully into a mutually acceptable play<br/>\n&gt; situation.  Thomas also plays with Aidan on his own<br/>\n&gt; numerous times but Aidan&#39;s parents seem never to have<br/>\n&gt; noticed.  They have villified Thomas into a bad and<br/>\n&gt; mean older child deliberately excluding Aidan, which<br/>\n&gt; he is not.  It&#39;s more like two similar children of a<br/>\n&gt; similar emotional age having trouble communicating<br/>\n&gt; with each other.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am wondering both how others might have dealt with a<br/>\n&gt; similar situation and what some thoughts are on this<br/>\n&gt; &quot;enforced sibling harmony.&quot;  My feelings are that it<br/>\n&gt; causes resentment and ill feelings between siblings<br/>\n&gt; eventually, and is contributing more to Aidan&#39;s being<br/>\n&gt; hair trigger sensative about exclusion.  I commented<br/>\n&gt; at one point in the course of the weekend about how<br/>\n&gt; well their 2 year old boy was playing with another two<br/>\n&gt; year old boy in the campground, as most kids that age<br/>\n&gt; simply play near each other not WITH each other, but<br/>\n&gt; there was a lot of intereaction going on between them.<br/>\n&gt; I was thinking this has everything to do with my baby<br/>\n&gt; nephew&#39;s personality, but my sister-in-law responded<br/>\n&gt; &quot;That&#39;s because I MAKE all my children play together.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nanci K.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

Does anyone force or enforce older siblings (or cousins) having to play with and include younger kids in whatever they want to be included","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1657882940\">I have a question.  Does anyone force or enforce older<br/>\nsiblings (or cousins) having to play with and include<br/>\nyounger kids in whatever they want to be included in? <br/>\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on the possible<br/>\nrepercussions of this?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister-in-law and brother seem to think it&#39;s a<br/>\nwonderful thing that they &quot;make all (their) kids play<br/>\ntogether.&quot;  What that really means is that if the<br/>\nyounger children, their four year old boy Aidan in<br/>\nparticular because he&#39;s the most demanding of their<br/>\ntwo younger children, want to get into a game or<br/>\nactivity of the older kids, he MUST be accomodated or<br/>\nthe older children will be punished.  If he wants to<br/>\nbe left alone with what he&#39;s doing however, they must<br/>\naccomodate that as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy older son Thomas (8) has trouble with this boy, not<br/>\nbecause he dislikes him, because he actually likes him<br/>\na lot.  Aidan&#39;s actually a very clever and sweet child<br/>\nwith much of the same interests as Thomas.  The first<br/>\nthing Thomas did when we arrived was to run and show<br/>\nAidan his bionicle toys.  Thomas has trouble because<br/>\nhe is not flexible enough to immediately wrap his mind<br/>\naround adjusting the game/play to include this rather<br/>\ndemading and sensative four year old, who is also a<br/>\nLOT like Thomas himself (not a comparison I can make<br/>\nin front of Aidan&#39;s parents.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nThomas also has trouble because Aidan wants to lead<br/>\nthe play and must be dealt with in a gentle and<br/>\npolitic way to avoid tantrums.  Aidan also, like most<br/>\ntoddlers, wants whatever you have and to be wherever<br/>\nyou are, just because you have it and are there. <br/>\nThomas is not known for his subtlety or patience and<br/>\nhas trouble communicating what he means in a socially<br/>\nacceptable way and a way that will appease this little<br/>\ncousin.  They misunderstand each other and lose<br/>\npatience with each other a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe invariable result of all this is that my<br/>\nsister-in-law calls her girls over and tells them they<br/>\ncannot play with Thomas if he will not include Aidan. <br/>\nThomas would actually be happy to include Aidan (and<br/>\nhas numerous times) if he had time and assistance to<br/>\nmediate incorporating him into a game.  Aidan throws a<br/>\ntantrum at any sign of resistance or wrong word or<br/>\naction from Thomas and then Aidan&#39;s parents step in<br/>\nwith ultimatums or just shortcut to scolding my son. <br/>\nWhen I have a chance to step in instead I can mediate<br/>\nthem successfully into a mutually acceptable play<br/>\nsituation.  Thomas also plays with Aidan on his own<br/>\nnumerous times but Aidan&#39;s parents seem never to have<br/>\nnoticed.  They have villified Thomas into a bad and<br/>\nmean older child deliberately excluding Aidan, which<br/>\nhe is not.  It&#39;s more like two similar children of a<br/>\nsimilar emotional age having trouble communicating<br/>\nwith each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am wondering both how others might have dealt with a<br/>\nsimilar situation and what some thoughts are on this<br/>\n&quot;enforced sibling harmony.&quot;  My feelings are that it<br/>\ncauses resentment and ill feelings between siblings<br/>\neventually, and is contributing more to Aidan&#39;s being<br/>\nhair trigger sensative about exclusion.  I commented<br/>\nat one point in the course of the weekend about how<br/>\nwell their 2 year old boy was playing with another two<br/>\nyear old boy in the campground, as most kids that age<br/>\nsimply play near each other not WITH each other, but<br/>\nthere was a lot of intereaction going on between them.<br/>\n I was thinking this has everything to do with my baby<br/>\nnephew&#39;s personality, but my sister-in-law responded<br/>\n&quot;That&#39;s because I MAKE all my children play together.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22743,"nextTopicId":22745}}
