Not so common on<br/>\nsidewalks or concrete.  But tuberculosis is endemic in<br/>\nAsia. And getting worse, here. Gobbing (spitting)is a<br/>\ncommon practice in some areas (to get rid of &quot;bad<br/>\nthroat devils&quot;). Urinating in public is also common in<br/>\nAsia so that all sort of things can be contracted on<br/>\nor through skin, from hepatitis (endemic in Asia) to<br/>\nweird fungi.  Shoes, and not touching anything, are<br/>\nnecessary for personal hygiene in some areas....such<br/>\nas hospitals (everywhere).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Asia the yucky shoes are left in an entrance hall<br/>\nand indoor &quot;slippers&quot; are donned.  Guest were the<br/>\nguest &quot;slippers&quot;.  I couldn&#39;t bear to do this in<br/>\nJapan....lots of people had fungi or various sorts, so<br/>\nI carried my own indoor shoes (thick socks), and the<br/>\nboys, with me in a bag. What a bother.  It was good to<br/>\nget back home where common people don&#39;t pee all over<br/>\neverything, and spitting is rude. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn FL sandspurs, prickly pear, and other prickly stuff<br/>\nas well as biting critters makes shoes desirable in<br/>\nrural areas. Hot sidewalks, tar, GLASS, bits of wire<br/>\nand other trash make shoes desirable in urban areas.<br/>\nGlass is even a problem at the beaches. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut when I was a child I met a friend of my<br/>\nmother&#39;s...an old Cracker who never wore shoes. <br/>\nSandspurs didn&#39;t stick in his feet, snakes couldn&#39;t<br/>\nbite through the thick tanned leather he had for skin.<br/>\n This old man wore skins and a coon-skin hat.  He made<br/>\ncoon-skin hats for my brothers and me, too. he did<br/>\nchew and spit, but didn&#39;t care if the slimy stuff<br/>\noozed up between his toes.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour neighbor can&#39;t cook out toxins.  Veggies have to<br/>\nbe cleaned everywhere, anyway.  Regardless of<br/>\nparasites....clean sand has an unpleasant texture, and<br/>\ninsects are an unpleasant surprise, too. Of course<br/>\ngrasshoppers and such are eaten (with relish) in lots<br/>\nof places, too.  To me, a fried grasshopper shop<br/>\nstinks up the whole street. <br/>\n<br/>\nSharon of the Swamp<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Nancy Wooton &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Felicitas@...\">Felicitas@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; on 2/8/02 3:02 PM, Joylyn at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joylyn@...\">joylyn@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; My girls also rarely wear shoes.

The mom has a Masters or Dr in Music,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-463490163\">Yep you are right, Sandra.  I understand their reasons, just don&#39;t share<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis family has two very bright children. The mom has a Masters or Dr in<br/>\nMusic, she teaches Lexie Piano, and Lexie has to bring clean socks when<br/>\nshe goes.  Lexie NEVER wears socks (except for snow play last week, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think her feet have seen socks in a year!) except for piano<br/>\nlessons. Anyway, both kids, the boy is 9 and the girl is 7, are<br/>\nbeautiful, gifted, sweet kids, but they rarely have a chance to be<br/>\nkids.  They are allowed mud play, but only on certain days and under<br/>\ncertain conditions.  Their house is spot less, and I do mean totally<br/>\nspot less. There are no clues that children live there, except the small<br/>\nshoes in the entry way.  But the kids spend time over here, where they<br/>\ncan play play station and computer games, or go play in the mud, or<br/>\nwrite all over our sidewalk with chalk.  They are in the gifted classes<br/>\nat school and I know that the mom doesn&#39;t really agree with the way we<br/>\nraise our children but she is far to polite to say anything, and also,<br/>\nit&#39;s really hard to dispute Lexie and Janene&#39;s skills, so that helps.  I<br/>\nthink it would be harder if Lexie were a late reader or if she wasn&#39;t so<br/>\nverbal.  Even though the 7 year old is almost a year older than Lexie,<br/>\nLexie&#39;s skills are far above her and both kids are in gifted classes, at<br/>\na magnet school.  So while I understand their reasons and respect their<br/>\nculture, I am often saddened by the, well, I;m not sure what to call it,<br/>\nit just seems those kids never are kids.  They both play piano and<br/>\nviolin and something else, and are gifted musically, but man, it&#39;s so<br/>\nnice to see them come to my house and relax and play crash bandicoot.<br/>\n<br/>\nrambling<br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 2/8/02 4:09:29 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joylyn@...\">joylyn@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; My girls also rarely wear shoes.
