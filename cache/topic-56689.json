A total of 238 babies born between  <br/>\nOctober 1995 and February 1998 were enrolled in an observational  <br/>\nprospective cohort study. Cognitive development was assessed using the  <br/>\nBayley Infant Development Scale. The results of multiple linear  <br/>\nregression analysis showed that infants breast-fed for longer than 4  <br/>\nmonths scored 4.3 points higher on the mental development scale than  <br/>\nthose breast-fed for less time. No differences were found in  <br/>\npsychomotor development as a function of feeding regimen or duration.  <br/>\nThe positive linear correlation observed between parental IQ and  <br/>\nmental development scores at 24 months was also statistically  <br/>\nsignificant (mother: r = 0.39; p &lt; 0.001; father: r = 0.43; p &lt;  <br/>\n0.001). It may be concluded that breast-feeding for longer than 4  <br/>\nmonths has a positive effect on the child&#39;s mental development at 24  <br/>\nmonths of age. Parental intelligence also appears to influence  <br/>\ncognitive development.<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nHello... Genetics?<br/>\nIf they didn&#39;t compare adopted kids with natural birth children as to  <br/>\nthe correlation of parental intelligence, I don&#39;t think they should  <br/>\neven have mentioned it.   Way most likely the breastfed babies were  <br/>\nbiological children of the mothers.  Way most likely the people they  <br/>\nwould find who would be available throughout a two-year study would be  <br/>\nfairly self-selected and interested in scientific studies.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I read a tag-on like &quot;Parental intelligence also appears to  <br/>\ninfluence cognitive development,&quot; I&#39;m embarrassed about all studies.    <br/>\nIt&#39;s just dismaying.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf at the end of the description of a study on the effect of regular  <br/>\nmeals on overall health they said that parental hair color also  <br/>\nappeared to influence the child&#39;s hair color, it wouldn&#39;t seem more  <br/>\ngoofy to me.  Perhaps I&#39;m looking at the social-science research world  <br/>\nthrough goofy-colored glasses, but I think that top example came with  <br/>\nit&#39;s own 3-Duh goofy glasses.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I&#39;m on a rant, I don&#39;t like breastfeeding being shortened to  <br/>\n&quot;bf.&quot;  We didn&#39;t name Marty Benjamin Franklin Dodd, which I REALLY  <br/>\nliked as a possible name, because his initials would be BFD.
