I see him in a bad moment of his life, like he&#39;s wearing dark glasses and seeing everything through a frustrating haze.  The truth is that the attitudes and behavior from his family shouldn&#39;t play a part in him becoming a peaceful person.  Oh it certainly won&#39;t be easy.  He&#39;s probably as lots of issues to face.  He can blame and make excuses, but change happens when we face those challenges and realize them for what they are, obstacles that we don&#39;t have to butt our heads against.<br/>\n<br/>\nI struggled with some of those issues myself.  It was really hard for me to finally admit that my attitude and behavior were choices, even if I was not actively making those choices.  Because of the way I grew up, my attitude was stuck on auto-pilot.  Once I started seeing and understanding a more peaceful life, my ties with my family became even more strained.  They saw my decisions as challenging theirs because I wasn&#39;t living the way they do.  However, my new attitude kept me calm during rough times and eventually my family backed down and wrote me off as an unthinking, uncaring, and harming to my children.  Even though I have a fabulous relationship with my children, and they don&#39;t, they consider themselves normal and me abnormal.  I think they are anticipating the crap hitting the fan when my fantasy world collapses.  I still like to think that my attitude will rub off on them at some point.  For now, I quit playing their games.  I don&#39;t let guilt me away from my peaceful life.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287815876,"authorName":"Robyn L.

How/why  <br/>\ndo you think unschooling is beneficial for boys?<br/>\n<br/>\nMany men work around their childhood shame and trauma, or take years  <br/>\nuntangling and overcoming it.

Some are timid;  <br/>\nsome are bullies If their parents could have planned ahead to avoid  <br/>\nshame and trauma, how much calmer and creative and courageous might  <br/>\ntheir sons have been? There are inevitable sorrows enough without  <br/>\nparents creating them. There are obstacles enough in life without  <br/>\nparents setting them purposely or carelessly. Young men who will thank  <br/>\ntheir mothers and hug their dads and who want to come home when they  <br/>\nhave the option do not come from harsh, traditional, punitive  <br/>\nparenting. If their mothers have been their allies and supporters  <br/>\nrather than their owners and bosses, life is different. If their  <br/>\nfathers have been their counsellors and partners rather than their  <br/>\ntrainers and overseers, those boys can grow up whole, in peace and  <br/>\nconfidence.<br/>\n------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest of it is here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bloggingboutboys.blogspot.com/2009/10/books-for-boys-sandra-dodds-big-book-of.html\">http://bloggingboutboys.blogspot.com/2009/10/books-for-boys-sandra-dodds-big-book-of.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Yelling and other negitivity","postDate":"1255056603","msgId":47851,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEUxRkJEREE5LTUwOTAtNEZCRi04N0RFLTE0QzI3RjRCOTg4QUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhhbTRvaiticmFnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhhbTRvaiticmFnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47850,"nextInTopic":47852,"prevInTime":47850,"nextInTime":47852,"topicId":47827,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-= I do however appreciate that you came to my and my children s defense! -=- We didn t.

I know it was hard for my husband to come home tired and find ramped-up kids with boundless energy.  When my kids have had a full day of activity, or some fresh air or whatever, their energy level at dinner time was more likely to match my husband&#39;s and things went more smoothly.  I used to put in a video right before my husband got home.  Or I&#39;d ask if they wanted to read stories right then, so we&#39;d be snuggled up and quiet and reading when dad arrived.  Maybe that would be a good time to suggest a bath, or drawing, or playing in a room that isn&#39;t right under foot.  These kinds of things might help in the transition time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he gets home, ask how his day went.  Make him a cup of tea.  Say &quot;Yay, Dad&#39;s home!&quot; and give him a big hug.  Stop what you&#39;re doing and give him some attention.  Little things can mean a lot after a long, frustrating day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI talked directly to my kids about what made it easier for their dad to transition.  It took my husband years to verbalize that he felt badly that when he got home, everyone was so busy doing what they were doing they couldn&#39;t pause long enough to greet him.  He felt left out.  We also realized that noisier activities are better when dad&#39;s gone, quieter activities better when dad&#39;s home or resting.  Those are things they were happy to do for him, when explained why.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d think first, work to make the house more peaceful.

What worked for us is I actually ended up making a deal with my husband - a verbal arrangement, discussed *not* in the heat of the moment, but at another time - that if he was feeling especially angry or short-tempered he could tell me and I&#39;d talk to the kids about being quieter so he could rest, or whatever, because in that moment I wasn&#39;t feeling angry or short-tempered, and I could talk to them in a way that was less threatening for the kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn our marriage, my husband is the one who focuses on financial aspects - mostly because he is the almost-only source of income, and because he understands it better.  He pretty much makes money decisions, and when he asks me not to spend anything extra in a particular month because finances are tighter for whatever reason, I don&#39;t argue or resist, I trust and don&#39;t spend anything extra, or make sure I discuss any expenditure with him to see if it was do-able.  In the same way, because I&#39;m the one home with the kids and the one delving into unschooling philosophy, I&#39;ve asked him to trust me in making those kinds of decisions, and sometimes that means acting as a go-between so that he can get what he needs without having to worry about how to get it.  He can go to his room and be ouchy, and I&#39;ll see what I can do to create a peaceful house in that moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs time went on, he learned how to do less reactive stuff and calm himself before interacting with the kids, and even realized he didn&#39;t need to be angry or frustrated at all, and things could get better anyhow.  But that was because I offered to be his buffer and the kids&#39; buffer, which gave him time and space to work things through for himself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEventually seeing that I could be peaceful with the kids and they&#39;d actually want to contribute to his peacefulness was very affirming for him.  I don&#39;t have to act as intermediary anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes just telling the kids that dad had an especially rough day and could use a little extra love and quiet, is all it takes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds to me like the original poster&#39;s husband has a lot going on right now, big things.  I understand her frustration and worry, and I also feel for the pain her husband must be in.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<br/>\n*~*~*~*~*<br/>\n&quot;Keep company with those who make you better.&quot; ~ English saying<br/>\n*~*~*~*~*<br/>\nwww.piscesgrrrl.blogspot.com<br/>\n*~*~*~*~*<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Yelling and other negitivity","postDate":"1255025533","msgId":47837,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRFNzg3RDQ4LUU4MzgtNEY5QS04RjlDLTJBQzNEMTFBOUU2REBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDk1Yzk3YWJiMDkxMDA4MTAyM2lhNTU0YjA5cTk5MTc0YmM3NmFhZjMyNzVAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDU5RDcxMzA4LUNGN0EtNDM3Ni04RjkzLTlENzFDNkM3RjI5QkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPGhhbDVpNStrZTJ0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8OTVjOTdhYmIwOTEwMDgxMDIzaWE1NTRiMDlxOTkxNzRiYzc2YWFmMzI3NUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":47836,"nextInTopic":47839,"prevInTime":47836,"nextInTime":47838,"topicId":47827,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-he keeps saying controlling things like  you WILL do what i tell you! and what gives you the right to tell me NO?! he has a lot going on personally ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-828475721\">-=-he keeps saying controlling things like &quot; you WILL do what i tell  <br/>\nyou!&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;what gives you the right to tell me NO?!&quot; he has a lot going on  <br/>\npersonally<br/>\nright now: he was recently estranged from his brother and is on his  <br/>\nroad to<br/>\nthe same with the rest of his family (entirely their doing, i assure  <br/>\nyou,<br/>\nnot his) and between that and finances i know he&#39;s at the end of his  <br/>\ntether<br/>\nbut it has to stop.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you new to the idea of unschooling?
