I turned round to find him<br/>\ncarefully taking all the baubles off the tree and putting them back in<br/>\ntheir box. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Could you leave them on the tree?&quot; I asked.<br/>\n&quot;No, I&#39;m tidying them!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy immediate/automatic thought was to physically stop him and tell him<br/>\nto leave it alone, and then I thought -- why? He&#39;s having fun, they&#39;re<br/>\nnot dangerous or super breakable, the tree is stable. He played with<br/>\nthem, in and out of the boxes, counting them and trying various ways of<br/>\npacking them, for another ten minutes or so. Then a bit later when he&#39;d<br/>\nmoved onto something else I spent 2 or 3 minutes putting them all back<br/>\nup again :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nHappy kid, happy parent. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJuliet</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75168,"nextTopicId":75198}}
