We see  <br/>\nit in the extreme form in gangs. We see it in the cliques that form  <br/>\nand are so all-important to middle and high school kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t seen that in my own kids - they have no desperation for some  <br/>\nsort of peer group-identity. Once in a while I&#39;ve even had kind of a  <br/>\nstrange passing thought that maybe there was something wrong with them  <br/>\nthat their &quot;group&quot; identity seems to be so about their own family.  <br/>\nThen I came to my senses and realized that this was the natural way  <br/>\nthings should be - that it is the other more common focus on peer  <br/>\ngroups that is unnatural. My kids are sociable and have lots of  <br/>\nfriends, but their &quot;identity&quot; seems very organic to me as opposed to  <br/>\nthe school-kids whose identity seems artificial, desperate, and  <br/>\ncobbled together and dependent on what social group they happen to be  <br/>\n&quot;in&quot; with.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that to say that unschooled children and teens engaging in simple  <br/>\nand unexpected-in-this-society acts, like voluntarily and happily  <br/>\nbeing helpful around the house, are the result of nurturing that  <br/>\norganic identity - respecting and supporting all those urges and not  <br/>\nsquashing or undermining them by imposing external rules and  <br/>\n&quot;consequences&quot; or bribes or punishments to try to manipulate their  <br/>\nbehavior. Instead of manipulation, older members of the family can  <br/>\nshow that they themselves are glad to be contributing to the family  <br/>\nlife and that they receive great satisfaction and joy from it, and  <br/>\nthey can openly and encouragingly welcome the increasing contributions  <br/>\nof the younger ones.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":324049237,"authorName":"saturnfire16","from":"&quot;saturnfire16&quot; &lt;saturnfire16@...&gt;","profile":"saturnfire16","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: *7 How does catering to each child/individual teach family values?","postDate":"1226617589","msgId":40217,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdmaWJ0bCtiOTFlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDg5ODRDNDgxLUQyNTYtNEQ5QS05QUY5LURBQjc1NTREQTE5QUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":40048,"nextInTopic":40239,"prevInTime":40216,"nextInTime":40218,"topicId":40048,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
