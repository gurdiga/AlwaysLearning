They are not parents of multiple <br/>\nkids<br/>\nbut I love their voices.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;In the last 4 years, between online, especially on boards that are <br/>\nspecifically for kids younger than school age, and in real life, I have seen so <br/>\nmuch unschooling advice given that people later either didn&#39;t believe or just <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t sustain. I know 2 moms that strove so desperately to be perfect, <br/>\nselfless moms to their first that they literally had pretty intense nervous <br/>\nbreakdowns when their second came along.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n But that was not about unschooling. I have seen that at least once just like <br/>\nthat and I think it was because the mother did not fully understand unschooling.<br/>\n  Just because one comes to an unschooling group and posts on it many times it <br/>\ndoes not mean they fully understand unschooling the way it is discussed here in <br/>\nthis group.  Just because a mother lets a child hits her in the face it does not <br/>\nmean that mother is striving for being a perfect mother. And yes I have heard <br/>\nthat!<br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve seen multiple families switch to a Waldorf curriculum because <br/>\nthey felt unschooling allowed their kids to talk to them in ways they were not <br/>\nOK with, or because the husband was unhappy with kids up late at night. In the <br/>\nsame vein, multiple moms I know have had to get IV fluids or had seizures lately <br/>\nbecause they were nursing older toddlers on demand even while vomiting or <br/>\notherwise pretty sick.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was not &quot;unschooling that allowed their kids to talk to them in the ways they <br/>\nwere not OK with&quot;. Unschooling does not allow or disallow anything on anyone&#39;s <br/>\nhome. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was the lack of understanding unschooling and a lack of being a partner to <br/>\nyour children and your partner.<br/>\nTo your children because kids do want to be nice to their dads and need guidance <br/>\nand presence and to your partner because his needs were not taken in <br/>\nconsideration.<br/>\nAbout the nursing , if you are too sick to nurse then you are too sick. Nursing <br/>\na toddler on demand will not make someone have to get IV fluids unless that <br/>\nperson is dehidrated for other reasons like being sick, or not taking in enough <br/>\nfluids.  Again that is not unschooling if someone is not taking care of their <br/>\nown health or someone is sick. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are no unschooling rules.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I was sad to be told lately by a non-unschooling homeschooler that someone <br/>\n&quot;says she an unschooler but other people say she can&#39;t be because her daughter <br/>\ntakes classes.&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy was that sad for you?  If she did not even consider herself and unschooler?<br/>\n I have seen some people come to groups and say :&quot;I did not know until today <br/>\nthat I was an unschooler all along&quot; But this people never really unschooled. <br/>\nThey may have not followed a curriculum but once they start talking about it  <br/>\nwhat they did is not the same as  discussed here at all!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;It just seems messed up that all these nice people who do just one not <br/>\nunschool-y thing--like what was the scandal about that conference? the speaker <br/>\nrequired that her son brush his teeth?--and a bunch of actual unschoolers who <br/>\njust don&#39;t want to be judged, just decide to call themselves something <br/>\ndifferent&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have not heard of that incident but there are people that call themselves <br/>\nunschoolers but they teach math curriculum or they require kids to read at least <br/>\n15 minutes a day, or cannot watch TV , or cannot play video games, or only a <br/>\nprescribed amount of screen time a day, or kids cannot eat anything not deamed <br/>\n&quot;healthy&quot;, or they cannot drinl pop/soda,......<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like you feel more people should  be unschoolers but I find that many  <br/>\nparents would not be good unschoolers. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot everyone can or should unschool.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: I&#39;m not a radical unschooler unless I let my children throw rocks at people","postDate":"1297908129","msgId":59809,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc2OTQ0Ny4yMDY5MS5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MTIubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlqaHE3bitkNzc1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlqaHE3bitkNzc1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":59808,"nextInTopic":59811,"prevInTime":59808,"nextInTime":59810,"topicId":59702,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***I m so frustrated to know that so many people feel they *have* to to the point of hurting their own health.

If a mom can&#39;t stop doing what she&#39;s doing that is hindering <br/>\nunschooling, then why call it that?  Why call it unschooling?  I used to attend <br/>\nthis semi regular play day meetup where everyone was unschooling.  In reality, <br/>\nthe parents that showed up there were really strict about food and manners and <br/>\nwhatnot.  It wasn&#39;t happy or fun or nice.  The kids would get upset as a direct <br/>\ncause of the kind of parenting these mothers were doing.  I stopped going.  They <br/>\nprobably still call in unschooling, but it certainly wasn&#39;t anything that I&#39;ve <br/>\nseen that led into the light of happy unschooling.  I can&#39;t stand there and give <br/>\nmy child ultimatums and knowingly watch that&#39;s child&#39;s face fall into sadness, <br/>\nand STILL do it.  I just can&#39;t.  It&#39;s not that all of life is one great big <br/>\nhappy bubble, but I try my best to not be the unhappy piece that pops it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf people don&#39;t want to do what it takes to unschool, then they shouldn&#39;t <br/>\nunschool, and they shouldn&#39;t call it that.  Chamille said the other day that it <br/>\nseemed like some people want to say they unschool to feel like a part of some <br/>\n&quot;cool&quot; club, that they just go through the motions of it but never actually <br/>\nchange anything to make their kids&#39; lives all happy and awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nEncouragement is a good thing.  Being blunt and honest is a good thing too.  No <br/>\nmatter how nice someone is, if they are perceived as being rude, it doesn&#39;t <br/>\nchange the niceness.  That rudeness is within that own person&#39;s thoughts. <br/>\n That&#39;s a huge mirror that some people can&#39;t or won&#39;t ever look into.  A child <br/>\nis only a child for a very short time and parents only get one shot at it. <br/>\n Getting unschooling up and running sooner, is better, IF that&#39;s what you want <br/>\nto do.  If that&#39;s not the goal, then who cares?  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some things that simply don&#39;t mesh with unschooling.

I didn&#39;t plan when they were to <br/>\nbe taught. I didn&#39;t create reading lessons. I didn&#39;t give them practice <br/>\nexercises. I didn&#39;t test them.

It goes back to nest building.... a foundation in which to live, and <br/>\nthrough that, kids can learn because the environment is ripe for it.  Kids who <br/>\nare allergic to dairy and have nothing but milk to drink in the fridge do NOT <br/>\nlive in a house that is comfortable.  If a mom lets her kid throw sand in <br/>\nanother child&#39;s face and then ends up with no friends, that is NOT a happy kid <br/>\nat peace with the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore and more, and maybe I&#39;m just getting older, I&#39;m finding that peace is a BIG <br/>\ndeal for unschooling to thrive.

Several of the women there have read about radical unschooling and been in some groups and email lists (not sure which ones, though possibly this one.)  I posted a snapshot of a part of our day and was told that I could not possibly be a radical unschooler because I don&#39;t let my children throw rocks at people among other things.  Unfortunately they seem to have gotten the impression, from whatever unschoolers they read about, that to do anything other than let your children do whatever they want is not radical unschooling.  I know that Sandra and the moderators of this list do not feel that way, but I am curious what you all *would* say about what I posted there.  With your permission, I would like to share it on the other board as well, or if you could send me to one of your links that would be fitting, that would be great.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what I posted:<br/>\n________________<br/>\nYou have made it clear that you are trying to break away from radical unschooling, so I won&#39;t try to make any suggestions since you have probably heard them all from the unschooling groups. I will just share what we do and how it works here, to be a voice of the other side both for you and anyone else who might be reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are radical unschoolers, which means that like other unschoolers we recognize that children are hard wired to learn, but unlike other unschoolers, we extend that belief to include not only academic subjects, but the rest of life. We do not have arbitrary rules, bed times, food restrictions, tv restrictions etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do NOT do TCS or any other form of non-coersive parenting. TCS is about never saying no. Radical unschooling is about learning and relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will tell you a little about our day today, so you can see how it works here. We went for a hike and dd2 wanted to wear her red sparkly shoes, which are not very good for climbing in. So, we brought her tennis shoes with us. When we got there, I noticed that it was not muddy (so the sparkly shoes would not get ruined) and that the trail was flat walking not hard climbing, so her shoes would probably be fine. Dh went ahead and suggested to her that she change into her tennis shoes, which she did.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe came to a part with a creek and a bridge and a big hill behind it. Dh took dd1 up the hill while I took dd2 on the bridge. She wanted to go down to the water. A TCS parent might be afraid to say no to this request either because of the potential meltdown or because of a belief that saying no might hinder their child&#39;s development. I do not fear saying no, but I said yes, out of a desire to facilitate learning and because I was enjoying exploring with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, like any 2.5 year old, she wanted to get IN the water. I do not have a &quot;rule&quot; about getting wet on hikes. I do have the common sense to recognize that we did not bring any extra clothes and it is cold out. So, I explained that to her and said that she could not get in, but she could touch it with her hands. We climbed around the bank, on the rocks and under the bridge. I helped her lean in to put her hands in and lay on the rocks on her tummy so she could reach further out. I realized right before we were done, that she was doing a little experiment: Is the water cold where it&#39;s moving fast? Is it still cold where it&#39;s still? Is it cold by this rock? Is it still cold on the other side of the creek?<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, dh was letting dd1 throw rocks off the top of the hill. Some parents have a standing rule about never throwing rocks. TCS would say that she &quot;needs&quot; to throw rocks and to stop her would be wrong. I don&#39;t agree with either one. Throwing the rocks was fine, until dd2 and I started walking toward them and could have gotten hit. Then dh had her stop for our safety. Radical unschooling is about learning and relationships. Part of having a good relationship is keeping everyone safe. If we need to say no to do that, we don&#39;t hesitate to do so. But we do explain because explanations lead to learning. And if a mutually agreeable solution can be found, for example, if she had asked to throw them the other direction, we would go allow that. However, she stopped without a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s just a brief snapshot of a part of a day, but that is how it works here. I do not fear saying no, but I do believe that children learn best with a lot of yes&#39;s. I give them the freedom to explore, make mistakes and learn about their own bodies, but we don&#39;t live in a vacuum, so I also take into account other people (including myself) and their feelings, property rights, and personal space.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t follow &quot;RU principles,&quot; I follow Biblical principles. I try to make decisions mindfully and thoughtfully, putting our relationship, learning, safety and respect first. I have not given up my parental authority, I just use it to partner with my child and give her as much freedom as I can.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do not have bed times, but we do help the kids get to sleep at an hour that is reasonable for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do not restrict any food or have rules about food, but I do buy healthy foods and talk about why we eat the way we do.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do not restrict tv, but I do provide lots of other interesting options AND watch shows with them and help them find things they are interested in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t do any of those things to &quot;be a radical unschooler.&quot; I do them because I have researched, prayed and deeply thought about each thing and slowly implemented it in our own lives. These were thoughtful, mindful decisions, not a full out abandonment of all rules so I could jump on the RU bandwagon. <br/>\n<br/>\n_____________<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you!<br/>\n<br/>\nEmily</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59872,"nextTopicId":59680}}
