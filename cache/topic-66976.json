I think that&#39;s a big part of it.  And if the technology is something children can understand and use easily that removes parental power and control, and puts a parent in a position of not knowing more than the child.  That&#39;s a danger to &quot;respect and discipline.&quot;   <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe the larger study looks at those things.  I hope so.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66831,"nextTopicId":67043}}
