He&#39;s dug out quite a pit and built up the sides with mud and is planning  <br/>\non getting a lot of baking soda and vinegar to make it erupt. I&#39;m not sure it  <br/>\nwill work as he has it at the moment, but we&#39;re working to find the best way <br/>\nto  make it *erupt*.<br/>\n <br/>\nWaterplay outside the &quot;norm&quot; is always a big hit here. The boys like  digging <br/>\na hole in their digging area and filling it with the hose. If there is a  <br/>\nflat, sort of paved or hard (or truly paved) surface, it is fun to let the water  <br/>\ntrickle from the hose at the top and find different things in the yard to <br/>\nchange  or dam the flow of water. Squeezing the hose flat in the middle so the <br/>\nwater  flow stops is fun, too-especially experimenting with fast-slow release to <br/>\nsee  how that effects the water pressure and flow. Puddles are fun. We like <br/>\nto play  in the rain when it isn&#39;t thunderstorming.<br/>\n <br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nDe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************Gas prices getting you down?

It lived in the kitchen with funnels and all sorts of things.  When<br/>\nthey were done, we&#39;d have fun with the brooms and &#39;clean&#39; up.  Usually it<br/>\nwas clean enough to just put all the rice back into the box.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to put water in our recyclable tubs and things and then freeze them.<br/>\nWe&#39;d go outside on the patio and draw or make things with the ice.  This<br/>\ncooled them down on the days that were hot.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have window markers that draw on all our windows and the sliding glass<br/>\ndoor.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe used cardboard and golf tees as our board and nails.  This was great with<br/>\nshoe boxes, too!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe made tons of confetti with paper.  The loved cutting things.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe played &#39;family ball&#39; with the squish balls intended for the pool.  This<br/>\nis where you put as many balls on the floor as you have and roll them as<br/>\nfast as you can back and forth.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also play sock snowball fights.  As it sounds, we get all our socks,<br/>\nseparate each individual sock and roll it into a ball.  Then we divide them<br/>\nand use the bed as the &#39;fort&#39; in between us and throw them to our heart&#39;s<br/>\ncontent.  Then when it was over, we&#39;d open a drawer in the dresser and play<br/>\n&#39;basketball&#39; to put them all away.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this age, I washed little &#39;real&#39; clothing as the boys were always in<br/>\ndress-up stuff.  I converted old clothing (some mine) into costumes like<br/>\nRobin Hood and capes out of old material or sheets.  Hats were a hit too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a sheet in the living room to make an instant cave to play in and<br/>\nread in.  A dining chair was used as the door to crawl under.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe spent a lot of time in the tub.  They make great tub toys that hold the<br/>\ncolor tablets, some bubbles if they wanted and they make color crayons that<br/>\ncan be used on the bathtub walls.  Sometimes just &#39;washing&#39; the walls with<br/>\nthe bubbles and a washcloth was enough to keep them occupied for hours!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnything that&#39;s easy to stack then knock over was fun.  We have soft blocks<br/>\nthat they loved to do this with.  I&#39;d build a &#39;structure&#39; as fast as I could<br/>\non my right, then as they were running I would build one as fast as I could<br/>\non my left.  This kept them running around for a bit!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe loved just adventuring, too.  We&#39;d get all our stuff (flashlights, a<br/>\nbucket to carry our stuff in, magnifying glass, map [usually something we<br/>\ndrew with the necessary &#39;x&#39; on it]) and headed out.  We&#39;d make up the<br/>\nmission as we went along and often it changed many times during the walk.<br/>\nWe&#39;d save a space on our deck that was to display all our &#39;treasure&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe boys enjoyed blowing bubbles and more so - they enjoyed chasing bubbles<br/>\nthat were blown.  This was great in the park or outside in the grass.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope you find something fun!<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nIn peace and love,<br/>\nGinger<br/>\nAnnie(18), Kai(9) and Kade(6)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://twofreeboysplus3.blogspot.com/\">http://twofreeboysplus3.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLOVE has impact.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s not our differences that divide us.

No<br/>\ncost/low cost would be great as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of her favorite activities include &quot;making messes&quot;, lol. I don&#39;t really<br/>\nthink of them as messes.
