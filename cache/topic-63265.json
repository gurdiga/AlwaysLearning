I am currently working on my Masterâs degree in Counseling at California State University, Long Beach to meet my goal of becoming a Marriage and Family Therapist (MFT).

From that time, I have been interested in how our alternative education has impacted us as a culture.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; As I began my studies in the Counseling field, I became more and more aware of how many therapists are unaware of the diversity that the homeschooling population includes.

The purpose of my study is to measure adult homeschoolerâs mental health needs, and their attitude towards seeking therapy. The results of my thesis will hopefully be used to benefit the homeschooling population by providing much needed information to the mental health profession. If there are any significant barriers for homeschoolers to seek therapy, this survey will isolate those as well.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I found your homeschooling organizationâs email address from an online search.
