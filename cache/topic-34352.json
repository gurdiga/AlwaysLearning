We&#39;ve been unschooling/deschooling for 13 months.  Still very new.  We are still very happy with this lifestyle.  But here is my question:  the kids say they are bored.  I offer &#39;field trips&#39; and inevitably 1 or 2 (of my 3 kids) don&#39;t want to do them. Even if they asked for it. We&#39;ve all had a lot of viral illnesses this winter, and the unschooling journey has very clearly meshed with some intense psychological work, which as we all know is tiring. Anyway, our days have a &#39;doldrum-y&#39; feeling.  We all seem to feel stuck, and yet so far the kids resist my ideas to bring the world home or go out and see it up close.  Sometimes the kids seem really happy and sometims very unhappy.  Is this an unsurprising phase?  I think that I&#39;d like to trust this phase and just ride with it.

I really appreciate all of the responses from those of you<br/>\nwith more experience - it must feel like you are answering the same<br/>\nquestions a lot though!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I feel like I have been on an unschooling &quot;high&quot; for about a month<br/>\nnow and am slowly coming down. This list has been kind of like a drug<br/>\nfor me - I can&#39;t get enough (It&#39;s definitely the best one that I<br/>\njoined)! The advice given to &quot;chill&quot; and to start living the<br/>\nprinciples with my husband and daughter is the best though.

I don&#39;t know what word I am looking for<br/>\nhere -- unprepared... overwhelmed... oh, I guess INADEQUATE would be<br/>\nthe best. I have actually always considered myself a pretty<br/>\ninteresting person -- my passions range from different sports, to<br/>\nscience, to music -- playing instruments, singing, dancing... I grew<br/>\nup on a farm, and then taught in the city. However, when I read about<br/>\nsome of your lives I don&#39;t feel all that &quot;sparkly&quot;. Part of my problem<br/>\nI think is that I am in &quot;deschooling&quot; mode for myself right now....<br/>\nSchool WAS my life (as a student and then a teacher) until my daughter<br/>\nwas born 2 years ago. I am with my daughter every day and watch a<br/>\nlittle boy that is her age and I LOVE it, which is why I love the idea<br/>\nof unschooling and continuing this way of life. His mom (the little<br/>\nboy I watch) suggested a &quot;loose curriculum&quot; and I kind of half<br/>\nheartedly agreed, but have not done anything like that (I love NOT<br/>\nhaving &quot;lesson plans&quot; now that I am not a teacher!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is getting long again (stream of consciousness)... I want to<br/>\nstart working towards becoming a more INTERESTING and INTERESTED<br/>\nperson now.... while my daughter is still little... I am just so used<br/>\nto the &quot;school way&quot; (and this goes back to the research idea too) that<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure how to break out of that mold. I know people have said<br/>\nlittle things -- Like going to a new store, going a different way to<br/>\nplaces etc. I feel so lazy sometimes though -- like in my mind I am<br/>\nnot an &quot;activity&quot; or &quot;crafty&quot; person (some things that might be great<br/>\nfor 2 year olds) and I also feel like I just don&#39;t KNOW that much -- I<br/>\nwas GREAT at school (learn it all and dump it out). I&#39;m not sure if<br/>\nthis is part of me just &quot;deschooling&quot; or something I can &quot;work&quot; on...<br/>\nAny suggestions would be GREATLY appreciated... I&#39;m trying to get out<br/>\nof &quot;schooly research&quot; mode (been reading and LOVING this stuff for a<br/>\nfew months now) and more into LET&#39;S DO THIS mode! <br/>\n<br/>\nthanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34348,"nextTopicId":34353}}
