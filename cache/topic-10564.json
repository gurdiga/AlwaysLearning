We&#39;re in the middle of our candy <br/>\nsale fundraiser, and we&#39;re doing it via site-sales at the local Lowe&#39;s.  It <br/>\nworks pretty well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is one of the kids took a dollar out of the till.  Her cousin saw <br/>\nher put her hand in the box (he had his hand in the box, too); I was standing <br/>\nright there, tho I didn&#39;t see her take it, next thing I see is her sticking a <br/>\ndollar into a coke machine.  Her cousin loudly confronted her and she denied <br/>\n(she&#39;s 9, he&#39;s 8).  She got her coke.  When I finally got all the money <br/>\ncounted at home today, of course, I was a dollar short.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was calm about it at the time, tried to let it go and get on the with the <br/>\nsale.  But I did quietly and without threat inform her that I would be able <br/>\nto know if a dollar was missing as soon as I counted the money.  (The <br/>\nconversation was complicated by the bossiness of the 8 yo towards his cousin, <br/>\nso I didn&#39;t have much choice but to let it go at that time, else it would <br/>\nescalate.)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I know for sure that she took the dollar, I&#39;m considering what to do <br/>\nabout.  It&#39;s not like it broke the bank, of course.  We received $40 in <br/>\ndonations alone that day, so the $1 for candy money can be made up out of <br/>\nthat.  It&#39;s the fact that she thought the money was hers to take.  I keep <br/>\ntrying to see it from her point of view.  Not the best circumstances at home; <br/>\nher grandmother brings her, her cousin and her sister to Camp Fire because <br/>\nthe parents won&#39;t; they&#39;re working the candy sale to pay for their $15 <br/>\nregistration, and they&#39;ve been on scholarship before that.  The two girls are <br/>\na real pain to deal with anyway, but we perservere.  My mother wisely <br/>\nreminded me that honesty is a virtue even the poor should hold.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI hate this part of me that seems to want to make excuses for her and let it <br/>\ngo.  But what am I teaching her as her CF leader if I do?  Shouldn&#39;t I at <br/>\nleast try to make the point to her, without shaming or embarrassing her?  <br/>\nShouldn&#39;t she be expected to give the money back?  How will I even get her to <br/>\nadmit that she took it?  <br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the Camp Fire Law is &quot;Be trustworthy&quot;, so I suspect we&#39;ll be working <br/>\non that at our next meeting.
