It&#39;s how we connect. We&#39;ve just expanded the<br/>\nneighborhood ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Nancy-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThere has for generations been a great badmouthing of women&#39;s  <br/>\ncommunications, especially by men.  Some men have tried to forbid  <br/>\ntheir wives from hanging out with other women.  Some have succeeded.   <br/>\nSome still do.<br/>\n<br/>\nWHY?  Why the big prejudice against women&#39;s communications?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not valued.<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t make money.<br/>\nIt&#39;s &quot;industry&quot;; they&#39;re not &quot;being productive.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Productivity&quot; can be a big sin.  Both my grandmothers crocheted me  <br/>\nhideous long vests in the 60&#39;s because they saw in some magazine that  <br/>\nteenaged girls somewhere liked them.  It wasn&#39;t in northern New  <br/>\nMexico.  I threw them away just a couple of months ago, because the  <br/>\nbox they had been stuck in for 30 years got mice.  And one had  <br/>\naluminum or light steel decorative hook fasteners (they weren&#39;t  <br/>\nrusty, so...)... so it couldn&#39;t have been washed anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nWomen LEARN from other women, from talking about childbirth, cooking,  <br/>\nyardwork, divorce (what to avoid, who&#39;s to be trusted), and they get  <br/>\nnews of changes in policies and politics, though it won&#39;t sound the  <br/>\nway the men talk about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to go into all the gory stories we can all think of  <br/>\nabout women being repressed.  I want to make the point that unless we  <br/>\nlook at it at least a little, we&#39;re in danger of repressing our  <br/>\nchildren the same way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Holly gets off MySpace, she *knows* things.  She knows who&#39;s  <br/>\ngetting alone how with whom, in an extended network of friends.  She  <br/>\nknows who&#39;s moving, coming home, depressed, has a new job, learned a  <br/>\nnew Photoshop trick, or some new html programming.  She knows who&#39;s  <br/>\ngot a haircut or new color.  I could brand that all worthless and non- <br/>\nproductive, but I&#39;m not going to.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband could say that all the time I spend writing e-mails like  <br/>\nthis is non-productive and wasteful.  Maybe he&#39;d rather I fix those  <br/>\ngrey shorts that are in the den and put away the laundry.  (Probably!  <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;)   But he knows it&#39;s not wasteful, and he knows philosophical  <br/>\ndiscussions are good for people&#39;s mental health and growth and  <br/>\nintegrity.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30769,"nextTopicId":30808}}
