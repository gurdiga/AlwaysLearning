My mom said plainly","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-101884525\">I know there is a reality to perception.  If I think something goofy,  <br/>\nit can be true that I think that, without it being objective truth.   <br/>\nMy mom said plainly that blue and green should never be worn  <br/>\ntogether, and that fish and milk consumed together could kill a  <br/>\nperson.   It&#39;s true that she thought those things; it&#39;s true that she  <br/>\nbelieved there was something in that.  I&#39;m over fifty years old and  <br/>\nhave more times that I could count had a fish sandwich and milkshake  <br/>\nat the same time, wearing a green t-shirt with jeans.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve lifted something from a second hand post from another list.   <br/>\nDon&#39;t identify the writer, even if any of you know who it was.  Even  <br/>\nif that writer is here, never mind.  Let&#39;s just look at this small bit:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-My six year old would eat nothing but sugar if I allowed. Would only<br/>\nbuying healthy options be considered &quot;controlling?&quot; -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first part went into the collection here:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/\">http://sandradodd.com/</a> <br/>\nifilet<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the second part is what I really want to look at.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Would only buying healthy options be considered &quot;controlling?&quot; -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people post in a place like this, do we hold them to what they  <br/>\nwrote, or slide more toward what they meant?<br/>\nIf so, toward what they thought they meant, or what they will wish  <br/>\nthey had meant when they see what they really wrote? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe answer to those questions is &quot;it depends,&quot; I&#39;m sure, and that  <br/>\nsome will do one and some will do the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome moms (and dads, I will say to be correct, but I don&#39;t ever  <br/>\nremember seeing it in a dad&#39;s writings) will ask us what we will  <br/>\nthink about her possible actions.    if she does X, will we consider  <br/>\nit Y+?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I limit, will all you people consider me to be controlling?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question might&#39;ve meant to be &quot;Would I have the same  <br/>\ndisadavantages of &#39;being controlling&#39; if I just don&#39;t buy a bunch of  <br/>\nsugary foods?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI know there are internal storms when someone is trying to move from  <br/>\none set of practices and assumptions to a whole new way of being and  <br/>\nthinking.  It&#39;s not quick or easy.    And I suppose if one&#39;s purpose  <br/>\nbefore was to appease other women (relatives, neighbors, best  <br/>\nfriends, doctors/nurses/counsellors) their assumption might be that  <br/>\nthe change will require appeasing a new bunch of women.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople don&#39;t have to really carefully consider WHY they will say &quot;no&quot;  <br/>\nto their kids, and swat them, and tell them to go to bed at 8:00.   <br/>\nThe fact that they can find a magazine article or a book that says  <br/>\n&quot;good for you&quot; and that others will commiserate with them about how  <br/>\nhard it is to be a mom and how hard kids are.  So it&#39;s possible to  <br/>\nplease lots of other adults, and do harm to children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad we have people like Joyce who can explain SO CLEARLY exactly  <br/>\n*why* something could cause longterm harm to relationships and habits  <br/>\nand such, so that people here have a much better basis for  <br/>\ndecisionmaking than what the rest of us will consider their actions  <br/>\nto be.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24165,"nextTopicId":24175}}
