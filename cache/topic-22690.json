Having to do this 180 times a year for <br/>\na &quot;daily log&quot; keeps my brain tied to my old &quot;school&quot;y way of <br/>\nthinking.  I have learned to keep the log away from my kids, so it is <br/>\njust my own head that suffers about it. **<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you keep a daily &quot;journal&quot; that&#39;s more for fun and your own recollection, and then only rethink about it as &quot;subjects&quot; once a week or once a month?  You&#39;d still be cranking out a &quot;daily&quot; report, but  in a batch, so you wouldn&#39;t have to think about it in those terms every single day.<br/>\n<br/>\n**<br/>\nAnother way <br/>\nis to keep a pretty thorough log for one year, but turn in a very <br/>\nabbreviated form of it and wait to see if that is accepted. <br/>\n**<br/>\nThis sounds like a sensible strategy.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22685,"nextTopicId":22609}}
