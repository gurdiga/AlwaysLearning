This is happening more and more as my daughter, Rowan, gets closer to <br/>\nturning 5yo in June.  She enjoys scary movies and shows, and seems to like the <br/>\nfeeling  of being scared. However, parts of shows and movies that used to be no <br/>\nbig deal are now making stronger impressions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day she was watching an episode of Backyardigans, which she typically <br/>\nhas not categorized as scary, and there was a scene with the hippo character as <br/>\na green colored pirate ghost.  For some reason, this image stuck with her for <br/>\ndays.  She would come running in from outside, the playroom, her bedroom, saying <br/>\nthat she keeps seeing the green pirate ghost.  She was acting afraid in a <br/>\ndifferent, more lasting way than she has before.  She seemed to remember the <br/>\nimage more vividly and for a longer time.  It&#39;s been about a week or so since we <br/>\nwatched that particular episode; she has only stopped mentioning it within the <br/>\nlast couple of days.<br/>\n<br/>\nRowan started watching shows and movies around 2yo. Since, she has seen The <br/>\nWizard of Oz, every Barbie and Disney princess movie (all quite frightening to <br/>\nme in different ways), and a handful of other scary-ish movies and lots of <br/>\nscary-ish shows. She has asked to watch a scary show almost daily for as long as <br/>\nI can remember, and she has very often watched the scary scene in a show <br/>\nrepeatedly. I am curious if this will change. I&#39;m excited to find out.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nLisa B<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":143043046,"authorName":"Ed Wendell","from":"&quot;Ed Wendell&quot; &lt;ewendell@...&gt;","profile":"zelco123","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Daughter not scared","postDate":"1304814034","msgId":61125,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU1N0UwNEQwNjkzNDRGN0FBMjAxNDM2NEU3RkQxN0E0QEVkUEM+","inReplyToHeader":"PDFCQzdCNjk4LTJGM0ItNDIxNi1BOTkwLTk2NDc5QkZEM0YyMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGlxM3UzZytxMDBrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8RDQ4QUMyMDcwRDkyNENGRkFFNUE3RURCRUE4NTIwRTFAVGFtYXJhPiA8MUJDN0I2OTgtMkYzQi00MjE2LUE5OTAtOTY0NzlCRkQzRjIxQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61124,"nextInTopic":61126,"prevInTime":61124,"nextInTime":61126,"topicId":61111,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Zachariah loved water parks and water slides when he was little - showed no fear at all.

Things expert rate as age appropriate are only<br/>\na guideline.  My experience is that kids are scared of real life<br/>\npossibilities, especially being alone or hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy eldest Rowan(now fifteen) was traumatised and could not sit through Lion<br/>\nKing at age three.  The other three year olds who were frightened of lots of<br/>\nother things seemed fine with it.  The dad at the party(it was a b-day<br/>\nparty) expressed outright disbelief--to him Rowan was a &quot;real boy&quot; who<br/>\nseemed completely fearless going on slides and trying new foods/experiences<br/>\nwith less resistance than his daughter.  I took Rowan home as this was a<br/>\nneighbour and out of earshot of this guys commentary.  He was always rating<br/>\nthe kids which made me uncomfortable and I always tactfully tried to diffuse<br/>\nthose situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the man was correct too. Rowan was fine with animatronix dinos that<br/>\nroared or large-screen scary creatures at the museum which seemed to scare<br/>\nkids  and expressed curiosity in the &quot;bat cave&quot; at a museum.  A long scary<br/>\ntunnel with bats which many a child left in tears.  He watched documentaries<br/>\non dinosaurs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Lion King had him bawling as soon as the dad died.  He ran out of the<br/>\nbirthday party and spent the rest of the weekend clinging to John(his dad).<br/>\nSame thing with Bambi by the way.  Although he watched more adult movies<br/>\nwith people chasing each other with guns just fine.  A lot of the movies<br/>\nthat set up families like Disney and then destroyed them just scared the<br/>\npants out of my three boys.  They could handle Jurassic Park before they<br/>\ncould handle some of the made for kids movies.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith three year old themes are important.  Separation from the aunt and<br/>\nuncle was scarier for my kids than any of the other issues in the wizard of<br/>\nOz.  Crispin once vomited at a drop-in play group because a group of people<br/>\nobfuscated his line of vision.  He could hear my voice but my the time I<br/>\nwandered between the fifteen or so people to reach him he was sobbing.  The<br/>\nother mothers could not believe my adventurous climbing toddler who seemed<br/>\nso independent was so upset--they were sure he was sick.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts worth thinking about how some people hate &quot;sappy&quot; movies--perhaps its<br/>\nthe emotional manipulation and tragedy that is too scary or to real to life?<br/>\n<br/>\nMarina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Daughter not scared","postDate":"1304776885","msgId":61114,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEUxRjg0Njc0LUNGODYtNDZGMS1BQUY1LTU1NDg3MUZBMjY1QUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEFEQzZFQkVCLTcwQTEtNDA1My05RUUzLTM2QjE5NUE1QkM1M0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGlxMmVsOSthbGZrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8QURDNkVCRUItNzBBMS00MDUzLTlFRTMtMzZCMTk1QTVCQzUzQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61113,"nextInTopic":61115,"prevInTime":61113,"nextInTime":61115,"topicId":61111,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
