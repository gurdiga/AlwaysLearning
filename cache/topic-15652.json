Sorry to those that are seeing this more than once.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 4 yo boy has, within the last month or so, become VERY interested in how things are spelled and writing them out.  My question is about him making the letters &quot;properly.&quot;  Let me explain the situation:<br/>\n<br/>\n Today he says &quot;Mom, how do you spell &#39;love mom&#39;?&quot;  So I say  the name of each letter and he writes it.  If he is not sure of the shape of the letter, I show it to him and he copies it.  As I am watching him do this over the last month I know that he is not making the letters properly (and I really hate to use that term, but don&#39;t know how else to explain it.)  The end result is a shape that looks like the letter it is supposed to represent, but the steps to get there are different.  For example:  a letter V is made with both sides coming up from the bottom, an O is made from the bottom and curving around to the right.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have not tried to correct him or instruct him at all.  I don&#39;t want to make it difficult and frustrating for him and I realize he is only 4.  My question I guess is really when should I?  I know that making the shapes in a certain way is what helps penmanship to flow.  Could I gently model this for him some how?  If I let it go too long is it going to be more difficult as he gets older?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may seem silly that I am asking this about my 4 yo when I have a 7 yo, but my approach to penmanship was much different with my 7yo and I don&#39;t wish to repeat those mistakes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much!<br/>\nJen  :o)<br/>\nMom to Beck (7) and Dane (4)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15661,"nextTopicId":15678}}
