I have gotten a lot better about finding words that will work in ALL situations. It takes time. One of the red flags that I see in this statement is �helping him to figure out how to make good choices�. The reason it raised a red flag is because I see some of my mainstream friends force their children to do things under the guise of helping their children to make good choices. The parent has predetermined what is �good� and the child is pushed towards whatever mom thinks is �good� without any input from the child.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was from another topic, but the food extremists are doing that to children now.  Unschoolers with food focus.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI did a talk on food Friday, but had too much in my outline and didn&#39;t get to all of it.  That&#39;s too bad I didn&#39;t plan better, because what I wanted to say was important.  So I promised people there I would put the rest of it at a link, but it was mostly outline/brief notes, and needs fleshing out, so I haven&#39;t finished yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this is the crux of it, the &quot;help them figure out good&quot; thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids can&#39;t figure out anything if there&#39;s someone hovering and saying &quot;Ooooh, good!&quot; and &quot;yuck, horrible.&quot;<br/>\nAnd in the case of food, if they&#39;re not allowed to decide which foods appeal to them, and what then those foods do to their body (which doesn&#39;t happen right then, and doesn&#39;t happen at all if the mom is coaching and pressuring them about what the MOM thinks or hopes will be happening), then those children don&#39;t learn to listen to their own bodies.  And it&#39;s likely that at some point they will learn NOT to listen to their moms.  Then they will be eating things the mom disapproves of, and a lot of it, and those might be things they never would even have chosen if their mom hadn&#39;t been sorting food into sin and virtue, poison and health, in extreme and sometimes arbitrary, faddish or political ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe quote above, in context, was about TV and was by Connie/otherstar here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/message/67356\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/message/67356</a><br/>\nI just lifted that one part to apply to food restrictions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67341,"nextTopicId":67346}}
