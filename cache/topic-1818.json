Since I studied design for theatre (not history where I<br/>\ngot some of my lowest grades), I know of him for his design work, costumes,<br/>\nsets, and most of all effects. He just loved those effects. Exploding staffs<br/>\nof silk anything, pyrotechnics, reversing costumes, concealed doors and<br/>\ntraps. I lot of what we see today in magicians acts were originally stylized<br/>\nby Inigo way back in the early 1600s. If you look him up in the history<br/>\nbooks I&#39;m sure they would talk about his architecture. I think he was<br/>\narchitect to the king or someone really important.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese masques started off as a kind of costume ball of ceremonial dances<br/>\nthat went crazy and eventually was presented at court and in public<br/>\ntheatres.  The more attention one could gather at a social event the better<br/>\nchance at whatever you would have with the court.  So Inigo perfected how to<br/>\nget attention. I guess it paid off in his architecture career. He could<br/>\ndesign sets, costumes, and to a small degree-lighting, he wrote many of the<br/>\nelaborate masques, directed and even performed in them . You might even call<br/>\nhim a ......Renaissance Man... &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-Dan Vilter</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2817773,"authorName":"LutraPearl@aol.com","from":"LutraPearl@...","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Famous Inigos","postDate":"1009720998","msgId":1871,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZlLjExNzVjNTQ3LjI5NjA3OGE2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":1852,"nextInTopic":1897,"prevInTime":1870,"nextInTime":1872,"topicId":1818,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
