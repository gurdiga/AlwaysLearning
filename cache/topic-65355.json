There are many others.  As far as she knows, she&#39;s the only one who hasn&#39;t been to school before.  One person is a youngish grandmother (18 year old daughter had a baby since class started).<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked how important the test was, and she said there are four or five tests (I&#39;m guessing the last one is the kind you can skip if the first four are good scores, but she doesn&#39;t know that system, and I didn&#39;t ask), and it&#39;s a pass/fail class.   THEN she said what surprised me.  You can retake each test two or three times.  &quot;They really do want to get people through that class,&quot; she said.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nEasiest test-taking situation ever in the world.   And she&#39;s looking forward to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a nice experience for her. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65301,"nextTopicId":65377}}
