Either way, it wouldn&#39;t mean someone else <br/>\nshould tell you that you&#39;re not a real homeschooler, especially in the rest <br/>\nof the homeschooling world where MANY people are enrolled (voluntarily) in <br/>\ncontrolling programs - many of them private - and are still considered part <br/>\nof the homeschooling community. People voluntarily sign up for all kinds of <br/>\ncorrespondence schools, for example, and still consider themselves part of <br/>\nthe homeschooling community. People buy the full Calvert Curriculum with <br/>\nteacher support and do just what the teacher tells them to do and send their <br/>\nkids papers in to be graded, but they still consider themselves part of the <br/>\nhomeschooling community. Shall we start telling them that they aren&#39;t real <br/>\nhomeschoolers since they&#39;ve given up so much control (and they PAY to give up <br/>\nthat control so they don&#39;t even have the excuse of getting free materials).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat effect does telling people that they aren&#39;t real homeschoolers have on <br/>\nthose who choose the public school programs? Does it mean that the public <br/>\nschools are going to shut down their programs and stop their nefarious <br/>\nactivities? <br/>\n<br/>\nNo, but it isolates those people in those programs even more than the public <br/>\nschools try to do already. It makes them leave open email lists when they <br/>\nhave to hear, yet again, that they&#39;re not real homeschoolers. The more <br/>\nisolated they are, the LESS aware they will be of the importance of <br/>\nmaintaining the option to homeschool independently and that is <br/>\ncounterproductive.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo tell people that are in certain programs that they aren&#39;t real <br/>\nhomeschoolers is hurtful for no good reason and it doesn&#39;t do anything at all <br/>\nto reduce the possible negative impacts of the programs themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3098,"nextTopicId":3100}}
