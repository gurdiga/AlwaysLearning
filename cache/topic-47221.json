I do notice you but &quot;good&quot; in  <br/>\nquotes, but without another word to substitute, it will be hard to  <br/>\nnot think of the child as willfully choosing their behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nEasy and spirited might be better term to help a parent see their  <br/>\nchild in a more positive light and help the parent respond in more  <br/>\npositive ways. Easy kids certainly make life easier for the  <br/>\nparents! ;-) But kids aren&#39;t intended to be convenient. If someone  <br/>\nwants convenience they should get a virtual fish tank for their TV. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor mindful parenting it&#39;s helpful to let go of &quot;listening&quot; or &quot;well  <br/>\nbehaved&quot; being the goal. Listening and well behaved are often  <br/>\neuphemisms for obedient. When a child doesn&#39;t &quot;listen&quot; it suggests  <br/>\nthey&#39;re being rude and performing other deliberate anti-social acts.  <br/>\nWhen in truth they&#39;re trying to meet their own needs. If they aren&#39;t  <br/>\nlistening it&#39;s because mom isn&#39;t listening to them. Mom isn&#39;t meeting  <br/>\ntheir needs so they&#39;re trying to do it themselves. Not listening is  <br/>\nin reality fierce determination.<br/>\n<br/>\nTantrums are last ditch attempts to communicate. It means the child  <br/>\nhas tried every way they know (though their repertoire may be small  <br/>\nwhen they&#39;re only 3!)  to let you know they are in need and they&#39;ve  <br/>\nbroken down in utter frustration. Imagine your husband dragging you  <br/>\naround to every fly fishing store in town and you&#39;re trying to let  <br/>\nhim know you&#39;ve reached your fly fishing limit and you&#39;re hungry and  <br/>\nyour back hurts and you&#39;re tired ... and he just keeps saying &quot;Soon.  <br/>\nI&#39;ll be done soon. And you can have something to eat at home. The  <br/>\nfood here is too expensive.&quot;  How long before you reached the point  <br/>\nwhere you just couldn&#39;t be polite any more?<br/>\n<br/>\nMeeting their needs doesn&#39;t mean dropping everything and doing  <br/>\nexactly what the child is asking for. It means being responsive and  <br/>\nhelping the child. It means being attentive and understanding the  <br/>\nchild&#39;s limits. One more minute to a child can feel like hours.  <br/>\n&quot;We&#39;ll get food at home,&quot; doesn&#39;t sound practical and frugal to the  <br/>\nchild. It sounds like money and what mom has to do is more important  <br/>\nthan their needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo communicate with kids, to build relationships with them, it&#39;s  <br/>\nhelpful to see and feel what the world is like through them. When  <br/>\nwe&#39;re seeing the world in the way we wish or want them to see it  <br/>\ninstead of the way they see it, our words and actions often send a  <br/>\nvery different message than we intend.

I was hoping to chat with other experienced unschoolers who<br/>\nare also single. I&#39;m not sure why this has gotten so out of proportion. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTechnically, you aren&#39;t unschooling.  The one single unschooling parent that I knew of, is still unschooling as far as I know, but I&#39;m not sure what she was doing when her child was a baby.  I only first heard about her and met her when her child was 6, he&#39;s now a teen.<br/>\nIf I were in a similar situation, I would work towards independence, so that by the time my child was legally school age, I would be able to keep that child home.<br/>\nWhen my oldest was 4, she went to a preschool/daycare and my husband and I worked full time.  The only way that I was able to do this is because she actually wanted to be there.  She got up excited to go there every morning, and didn&#39;t want to leave her friends in the evening.  I hadn&#39;t intended on homeschooling at all, let alone unschooling.  If she had hated going, I still would have found a way to get her out, even though, at the time we needed both incomes.<br/>\nShe didn&#39;t mind leaving either.  When she stopped going, it coincided with her best friend not going and all of us moving in together to save money on housing, which allowed me to quit my job since my plan was to enroll her in a co-op public school that required parent involvement.<br/>\nUnschooling takes a huge time commitment!  It doesn&#39;t get any less so as they get older, although older kids will let you get work done here and there if you&#39;ve built up that kind of relationship in which the child isn&#39;t needy for the parent&#39;s attention.<br/>\nIf an 18 mo old baby feels desperate and needy because mom is working, that neediness won&#39;t go away simply because the child gets older.  I used to work in daycare centers.  They are full of desperately needy children.  I&#39;m not trying to be unsympathetic to the need to work and still raise a baby.  It&#39;ll be about choices each and everyday.  Sometimes you may choose to put a child in daycare to work, sometimes you work really hard to find another way, even if, in the meantime you have a baby in daycare.  It may help to have short term and long term goals with time frames, so that you reach the seemingly unattainable.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Intro and anyone single?","postDate":"1253135115","msgId":47256,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAzQTc2QTI1LUJDMTQtNDI0QS04RUM1LTY4RUM0QUM0QUJFRUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDZhN2JjY2E2MDkwOTE2MTM0NnM2NDVlOTBlZW0yMGIxZGJlYzE2YTJjZjIwQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGg4cXBxNysxMzB2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8ODA5RDdCRDUtRUQ1OC00Q0Q5LUI1MDQtNjk2MTIzOENEMkQ1QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8NmE3YmNjYTYwOTA5MTYxMjI2cGZjMzM4NnE5NjRhNjkwZGRkNTI5ODZlQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8Nzk5RkFCMjYtMDlGOC00NjQ2LTg3MkYtRUNEMzlBMDA1QzU1QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8NmE3YmNjYTYwOTA5MTYxMzQ2czY0NWU5MGVlbTIwYjFkYmVjMTZhMmNmMjBAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":47255,"nextInTopic":47257,"prevInTime":47255,"nextInTime":47257,"topicId":47221,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I m not sure why this has gotten so out of proportion. -=- It s perfectly proportioned.
