They love me; I was the oldest  <br/>\ngrandchild of the second-oldest sibling, the most local and stable  <br/>\none for many years.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will get points for having a kid named Kirby living in Texas.

How much would  <br/>\nsomeone have to pay me for me to &quot;be supportive&quot; of everyone who  <br/>\ncomes by?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the autism?  It just popped up then.  It makes it almost like<br/>\n&quot;Doctor, will I be able to play the piano?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Yes.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Wonderful!  I never could before.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe original question is below, and yet I&#39;m supposed to feel guilty  <br/>\n(in addition to all else) for boys having autism.  It&#39;s too bad I  <br/>\ncan&#39;t design and support an unschooling program that will fix  <br/>\neverything for everybody, whether I know the details or not.  It&#39;s a  <br/>\nsorry thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------<br/>\nI enjoyed your blog/website and thought I&#39;d ask your opinion on  <br/>\nunschooling while still meeting the needs of &#39;LDs&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have always &#39;quasi-unschooled&#39; I guess. We are not radical  <br/>\nunschoolers, but have never gone by grade levels or curriculums or  <br/>\ntesting. We have always been child interest led and done what works  <br/>\nfor out boys when it works for them, not what &#39;the experts&#39; say what  <br/>\nand when they &#39;need&#39;. But we are not radical ( we do insist on &quot;the 3  <br/>\nRs&quot; but we work them around our kidsi tersts and abilities, etc)<br/>\n<br/>\nI do like our &#39;almost unschool&#39; ways, but my concern is for my 11 yr  <br/>\nold. He has dyslexia, an auditory processing problem and some sensory  <br/>\ndisorders.  I do not expect him to be on &quot;state grade level&quot; and I  <br/>\nknow that he&#39;ll get things when he&#39;s ready, but I have some of these  <br/>\nissues as well and from my own experience and my research, I believe  <br/>\nthat he will need to be taught certain things (not just left alone to  <br/>\nget when he&#39;s ready), but I still want to go at his pace and his  <br/>\ncomfort and ability.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I just need some encouragement about how and where therapy  <br/>\nand training when it comes to dysfunctions fits into an unschool  <br/>\nmindset.<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah.  I&#39;m starting to rant a bit.   I&#39;ll go and watch movies and  <br/>\nmake Thinking Sticks or something now.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I get shamed a third time in this 24 hour period, I&#39;m going to  <br/>\nneed a hot fudge sundae or a big cake, because unlike my children, I  <br/>\nwas trained to use food for reward and comfort, and if I find myself  <br/>\nvery needy, I WILL eat chocolate, and lots of it.  And it will be too  <br/>\nbad someone couldn&#39;t have been more supportive of my offering free  <br/>\nideas and inspiration, even to people who don&#39;t agree with me.    Oh  <br/>\nwell, mothers of dyslexic made-to-read boys, and mothers who say  <br/>\nhorsepucky to sweet unschooling teens, and whoever #3 is.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a trap.  The next person who snarks or complains about me is  <br/>\n#3, I binge, and someone&#39;s to blame.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34930,"nextTopicId":34938}}
