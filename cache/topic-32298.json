Perhaps she was embarrassed about her behavior.  Perhaps her emotions were still stirred up and she was still &#39;in the story&#39; of &#39;he messed my game up on purpose&#39;.... Another idea would have been to say, &quot;I can see you&#39;re very upset right now.  You were doing something and now it has been changed.  How can I help you?&quot;  Perhaps listening... .perhaps she&#39;d preferred to be ignored so as not to draw attention to her....   If she can&#39;t apologize that day, imo, it would have been okay for her to contact him or apologize to him next time she saw him....   (I know I&#39;ve treated people poorly when in upset and just couldn&#39;t muster up the ego to admit it immediately.... )<br/>\n<br/>\nYou asked, &quot;how do you handle when your child is rude?&quot;   In theory, I ask what&#39;s going on for my child.  <br/>\n<br/>\nUnrelated story.... when my son was 4-5yo, he would hit a lot... it was very frustrating and embarrassing for me... esp since he was a big kid.....  after a long time, I figured out that he hit when he was hungry... so I got to the point of, if I missed out on noticing his hunger or feeding him regularly, that when he hit, I said, &quot;let&#39;s go eat&#39;  (nobody was EVER hurt)... one day, I asked him what it was like when he hit and he told me through his tears that he hated it... that he got made at himself whenever he hit someone... that he felt sad when his friend was hurt.. .that he did not want to hit but it was &#39;an accident&#39;....<br/>\nMy &#39;take home message&#39; from that conversation was that I did not want to contribute to his self-criticism....  he was &#39;beating himself up&#39; already after he hit someone.... I did not want to contribute to that.... so I became more &#39;solution&#39; focused.. let&#39;s eat.... how do you want to handle this now that an &#39;oopsy&#39; has happened.... I called his outbursts &#39;oopsies&#39;..... bec. that&#39;s what it was... it was not &#39;intentional&#39; to hurt someone...  it just happens sometimes....    I know that to be true bec. I have oopsies, too... I don&#39;t mean to be mean to my kids but sometimes, I&#39;m feeling badly about something and I say something mean to them.... I apologize and say it&#39;s an oopsy... not part of my intention of how to be with them....<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps related or not, my son stopped hitting after that....  could have been a developmental thing... who knows... but being with him in that way was valuable to me.... to get away from right and wrong...  and the experience of compassion towards him felt better in me than the feelings of anger/embarrassment....<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, my kids are calling from the stable to be picked up so I can&#39;t write much more now....<br/>\nI also have an opinion about public spaces and who gets to decide how the chairs are used... I&#39;m big on communication and working things out.... I&#39;m not big on assuming that people would have a problem with what kids/people choose to do....  So, aside from being &#39;really annoying&#39; (to be personally defined : ), I&#39;d check in with  people about whether they are okay with the play and let them be responsible for speaking up.... I&#39;ve been places where I shushed my kids and heard back &#39;we love the playful noises&#39;..... so, watch what you assume, imo... and, imo, children can ask about jumping on furniture and be willing to hear no or an alternative....<br/>\n<br/>\nOff I go.... <br/>\nJane<br/>\n(who will send this without re-reading/editing!

I have said <br/>\nat different times, &quot;It&#39;s only a game (or fun) if everyone is playing.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSometime kids like being splashed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis reminded me of a time at a small hotel pool where Jayn and a stranger, <br/>\na boy very slightly older and certainly about the same size, started up a <br/>\nsplashing game. Jayn *loves* to be splashed, and will say so and also say if <br/>\nit is too much. She was also clearly a competent swimmer by then.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever the boy&#39;s Mom decided that he wasn&#39;t being a gentleman and started <br/>\nshouting at him, from her seat nearby me, loud and with that warning tone in <br/>\nher voice that I&#39;m sure we are all familiar with, to stop splashing and <br/>\nadded some reason that was an assumption about Jayn&#39;s enjoyment (I don&#39;t <br/>\nremember the exact words, just the sense). With the intention of being <br/>\nreassuring, I said to the mom something like (my best recollection) &quot;Oh my <br/>\ndaughter likes being splashed. She&#39;s enjoying it.&quot; The mom made some <br/>\nnon-committal noise, and within a minute shouted at her son again the threat <br/>\nthat if he splashed the &quot;little girl&quot; he would have to get out. I seem to <br/>\nremember her saying something about &quot;violent play&quot; which was clearly a dig <br/>\nboth at her son and at Jayn.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point I got up and went over to Jayn and said, and this I do <br/>\nremember, &quot;This boy gets into trouble if he splashes, so will you please not <br/>\nsplash him.&quot; She was a bit sad I think, and they very quickly stopped <br/>\nplaying together at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoon Jayn got out to do some other playing, since she had some other friends <br/>\nat the pool. They started playing a game in the garden instead, and had left <br/>\na pile of Barbies on the ground nearby. I saw the little boy get out of the <br/>\npool and walk to the jacuzzi. I saw him go significantly out of his way to <br/>\nmake sure that he walked over the dolls and dripped water over them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dolls weren&#39;t actually hurt by this - it was probably only a matter of <br/>\ntime before they might be in the pool too - but I felt very sad for the boy. <br/>\nI am guessing he felt resentful, powerless, embarrassed, misunderstood. <br/>\nLuckily his mom didn&#39;t see this little act of sabotage, and I wasn&#39;t going <br/>\nto tell her about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I cringe, because I<br/>\nthink there have been times when I&#39;ve been this mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are not wild and generally do not destroy things.  We are pretty<br/>\nlaid back, calm people.  However, I know there were times when I&#39;ve gone<br/>\ninto other people&#39;s houses and I&#39;d have no idea what the kids could and<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t touch. Whenever I ask, I&#39;ve had most people say &quot;oh the kids will<br/>\nbe fine, they can touch whatever they like&quot;.  I just don&#39;t know when it&#39;s<br/>\n&quot;too far&quot;, though.  At our home children are allowed to jump on the couch<br/>\nand beds.  They are allowed to climb on furniture.  My 3yo ds loves to touch<br/>\nthings and see how they work.  He&#39;ll walk around touching everything that<br/>\nlooks interesting to him and push buttons, roll, poke, examine it all.<br/>\nSometimes it&#39;s OK and sometimes it&#39;s not.

So,<br/>\nnow I just tell them to leave the guitar alone because my aunt got kind of<br/>\nirritated about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the kids were younger (they are 3 and 6 now) this was way more of an<br/>\nissue for us.  We spent a lot of time not going to certain places and<br/>\ncertain people&#39;s houses.  I can still remember clearly trying to console my<br/>\nsensitive dd while my little ds (around 1-2) would run off touching as many<br/>\nthings as he could.  I had to pick and choose very carefully where we&#39;d<br/>\nspent our time because it was a difficult period for me.  Still now, there<br/>\nare some places we don&#39;t go very often. I took the kids to the museum the<br/>\nother day after not being there for almost a year because my ds kept running<br/>\nand bumping into things.  Not good in a museum..!  Our visit was much better<br/>\nthis time, but, we had to skip some things my dd was interested in because<br/>\nds wasn&#39;t interested and walked off.  Thankfully we have a membership (it&#39;s<br/>\na combined one with the science center, which they both love) and I can take<br/>\nher alone one day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am learning along with them about these things.  I grew up isolated with<br/>\njust my mom who didn&#39;t speak to me very often.  We didn&#39;t visit people.  By<br/>\nthe time I went to school, I was extremely shy and afraid of everyone.  It<br/>\nhas taken me a long time just to learn the basics and I still, sometimes,<br/>\nstick my foot in my mouth or do something that &quot;normal&quot; people wouldn&#39;t do.<br/>\nI know obvious things (expensive, rare or delicate looking items) that my<br/>\nchildren shouldn&#39;t play with or do, but, I have a hard time knowing the<br/>\nrules of the house, since everyone&#39;s are so different.  I usually let people<br/>\nknow ahead of time that while my children are well behaved,  they are young,<br/>\nso, let me know if there&#39;s anything you want them to stay away from.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also curious as to how people have handled these situations at<br/>\nother people&#39;s houses.  I see here a lot of you frown on climbing on<br/>\nfurniture and touching certain things.  When my ds was young and loved to<br/>\nclimb, after a few times of basically saying &quot;they don&#39;t want you to touch<br/>\nthat/climb on there, get down&quot; (basically saying No!) or redirecting,  it<br/>\nwould get really frustrating for a small child.  So, we&#39;d just leave (which<br/>\nI&#39;m sure relieved the other person!).  .<br/>\n<br/>\nJen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269526657,"authorName":"Lara Miller","from":"Lara Miller &lt;birthmamma@...&gt;","profile":"birthmamma2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re:  How to better handle this situation","postDate":"1203904876","msgId":32351,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEMwNDA3RTE3LTlFRTktNDJBOS1BRjA4LUMxODdCNjE0RDA0NkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDc5ODU1MkRFLUJDMEEtNDRBQy04NzdBLTA5RjVBNzRFRUJFRkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGM0MS4yYzVlOTRlYy4zNGYyYmFiNkBhb2wuY29tPiA8Njg1Qjk4OTAtQTkxMC00NTVFLTlDMDItNDUzM0E3QjE2MTFDQG1hYy5jb20+IDw3OTg1NTJERS1CQzBBLTQ0QUMtODc3QS0wOUY1QTc0RUVCRUZAc2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":32344,"nextInTopic":32357,"prevInTime":32350,"nextInTime":32352,"topicId":32298,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sorry for not trimming but I am on my cell.

When we left someone&#39;s house &quot;I&quot; always helped to clean up and  <br/>\nusually just included the kids as I did that. I&#39;d say, &quot;Well, we&#39;re  <br/>\ngoing to need to get going in a few minutes so let&#39;s clean up a  <br/>\nlittle. Here, Roya, help me put all the blocks in that bucket, okay?&quot;  <br/>\nSometimes the kids helped, sometimes they didn&#39;t. Either way, they got  <br/>\nthe idea that we at least offer to help, that became the &quot;normal&quot; way  <br/>\nto behave. Same with most other behaviors - if my child climbed up on  <br/>\na coffee table at someone else&#39;s house, I&#39;d swoop her up in my arms  <br/>\nand say, &quot;Oooh, not on on their coffee table - here, let&#39;s do this,  <br/>\ninstead....&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPutting chairs on their sides, in a public place, is usually not an  <br/>\nokay thing to do,  I mean, you&#39;d have to judge whether that really was  <br/>\nappropriate to be doing - but, assuming for the moment that it was  <br/>\nokay under the circumstances, if I saw the dad starting to turn the  <br/>\nchairs back upright, I&#39;d quickly stop him, saying, &quot;That&#39;s okay, I&#39;m  <br/>\nletting her do that with the chairs.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the child still has such an extreme reaction (and, believe me, I  <br/>\nhave an INTENSE kid who had these kinds of reactions and I know how  <br/>\nquickly it can start and how extreme it can get), I would immediately  <br/>\nget the child off away from other people. I really think it is very  <br/>\nvery rude to let someone have a major explosion right in the midst of  <br/>\nothers engaged in their own activities. For the sake of the child and  <br/>\nthe other people - move the child to a more private spot. Just that  <br/>\noften is enough to help them calm down and think about the situation.  <br/>\nBeing in front of other people creates added pressures and heightens  <br/>\npanic and stress.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, the important thing is not how the dad felt about it - I mean,  <br/>\nmaybe he should be apologizing, too, for putting up the chairs without  <br/>\neven bothering to notice that they were being purposely put that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what is important is that the child, over time, learn better ways  <br/>\nto deal with frustration, obstacles, annoyances, and so on. So, next  <br/>\ntime, the parent sees the child doing something that others might  <br/>\nobject to or might interfere with, the parent can help the child be  <br/>\nprepared -- say: &quot;If you put the chairs down on their sides, some  <br/>\ngrown-ups or even other kids might think they&#39;re are being helpful by  <br/>\nputting them back upright. You can just say that you want them like  <br/>\nthis.&quot; Or, &quot;Some adults might not like you doing this, so if they say  <br/>\nor do anything to you about it, you can just come get me and I&#39;ll talk  <br/>\nto them for you, if you want.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, you, the parent, then have to be on the look-out for situations  <br/>\nthat might bring about these kinds of explosions....head them off by  <br/>\npreparing the child with some options of how to respond in case.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a while, the child will have a sort of tool box filled with  <br/>\noptions and won&#39;t need you to offer the tools every time.

Bring <br/>\nshaving cream to spray on the water and mess with, or a spray bottle <br/>\n(this would only help if there&#39;s a tub surround, but if there is, <br/>\nthen it helps to direct the splashing), or put ice in the tub to play <br/>\nwith (nod to Sandra on that one), or have them put their ears under <br/>\nwater to see if they can hear when you bang on the tub in different <br/>\nplaces.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we definitely need to give our kids information about <br/>\nprotecting other people&#39;s property, so I&#39;m not suggesting that you <br/>\n*only* offer other games and never mention the problem with water on <br/>\nthe walls.  But depending on the child in question, you might have <br/>\nbetter luck with the suggested alternative game if it&#39;s just a new <br/>\ngame, instead of &quot;something we have to do because we can&#39;t splash.&quot;  <br/>\nAnd then, while everyone is drying off, you can mention how water <br/>\nmakes plaster soggy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf all else fails and I have to remove ds from a situation because we <br/>\njust can&#39;t turn it around, things go much better if I can keep myself <br/>\nout of the angry, frustrated place.

And  <br/>\n&gt; the kids don&#39;t want it either as the rest of the evening was a  <br/>\n&gt; disaster.  I was grumpy, they were pissed and it just kept  <br/>\n&gt; escalating out of control.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;The peace of another person&#39;s house is theirs.

I think maybe I need to give  <br/>\n&gt; them a task to focus on.  Maybe that would keep them distracted.   <br/>\n&gt; If you have seen Ice Age 2, my boys are just like those two possum  <br/>\n&gt; brothers!  They are 6 & 9, and I think old enough to be better in  <br/>\n&gt; control of their bodies.  But it is very frustrating and I find  <br/>\n&gt; myself not able to focus on the task at hand, like looking for a  <br/>\n&gt; specific type of grocery when they are head butting each other in  <br/>\n&gt; the isle!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Blessings,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lara Miller<br/>\n&gt; Currently just outside of Mobile, AL!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mytripjournal.com/millerfamily\">http://www.mytripjournal.com/millerfamily</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Messages in this topic (2)Reply (via web post) | Start a new topic<br/>\n&gt; Messages | Files | Photos | Links | Database | Polls | Members |  <br/>\n&gt; Calendar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Change settings via the Web (Yahoo!

There are other ways to deal with it, though.  You  <br/>\nmight have apologized for her, explained in as neutral a way as you  <br/>\ncould, found some chairs she COULD turn on their sides (IF that was a  <br/>\ngood idea; the rec manager might have thought no).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I told her that if she would like to write it on<br/>\n<br/>\npaper that would be fine, she didn&#39;t have to talk to him.

Every time we make a choice where other people are,  <br/>\nthey see it and they have an opinion.  That can&#39;t be helped.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you let your kids damage someone else&#39;s stuff, you helped them,  <br/>\npretty effectively, so it&#39;s more than a judgment of your tone of  <br/>\nvoice and handling.  It&#39;s whether  YOU care about the other person&#39;s  <br/>\nstuff.  I have a guitar out in the living room right now, leaning up  <br/>\nin a corner, not in a case.  We&#39;ve only had teens and older here for  <br/>\na long time, and I&#39;m not worried about it, but if little kids came  <br/>\nover and I forgot the guitar was there and the mom didn&#39;t move  <br/>\nQUICKLY to get between  her kids and the guitar, I&#39;d be cranky with  <br/>\nthe mom.  If I thought about it I&#39;d take the guitar where kids  <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t see it, and put out some kid-safe instruments.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-The other part of me just doesn&#39;t care, but<br/>\n<br/>\nmostly I wonder &quot;are there limits&quot;? What to do?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOther people&#39;s property is important.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe peace of another person&#39;s house is theirs.   If they want so much  <br/>\npeace you can&#39;t have a pleasant visit at all, then they might lose  <br/>\nthe privilege of seeing you.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen mine were small and the grandparents were nervous about their  <br/>\nnoise and movement, we figured out that public places were best, or  <br/>\nout in the yard.  Miniature golf in Ruidoso, children&#39;s museum in  <br/>\nAlbuquerque, the little zoo and train in Alamogordo, where they live-- <br/>\nany of those neutral and kid-friendly places were safer and better  <br/>\nplaces to hang out.  The kids could be quick and loud AND impress the  <br/>\ngrandparents with their cleverness, and the house was safe and quiet  <br/>\nmeanwhile.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269526657,"authorName":"Lara Miller","from":"Lara Miller &lt;birthmamma@...&gt;","profile":"birthmamma2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"How to better handle this situation","postDate":"1203830921","msgId":32298,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExOTE1RDA2LTkzNEYtNDVFRi04QzgyLTcwNzFDQzgyMUQzMEBtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":32302,"prevInTime":32297,"nextInTime":32299,"topicId":32298,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"One of the struggles I am having with unschooling parenting is what to do when I feel my children have or are behaving inappropriately in a public setting or","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1620963712\">One of the struggles I am having with unschooling parenting is what  <br/>\nto do when I feel my children have or are behaving inappropriately in  <br/>\na public setting or when in someone else&#39;s home.  I want them to have  <br/>\nfreedom of choosing their own behavior, but at times &quot;I&quot; feel they  <br/>\nhave crossed the line of acceptable and I fight this urge to jump  <br/>\nright in there and tell them what they need to be doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here is what happened tonight.  We had met another family out at a  <br/>\nrec hall to play some games.  All of the kids were running around and  <br/>\nhaving a good time and I was explaining to the other dad how to play  <br/>\nthis game we brought.  My 8yo dd was playing under the table and  <br/>\nstarted taking the chairs and flipping them on their sides and making  <br/>\na fort.  The other dad, honestly thinking that dd was struggling to  <br/>\nturn the chairs back up right, &quot;helped&quot; her by taking her chairs that  <br/>\nshe has specifically put the way she wanted and put them back  <br/>\nupright.  Well you would have thought that the world had come to an  <br/>\nend.  She shot up and started screaming and saying all kinds of very  <br/>\ninappropriate things, and saying them in such a way that they were  <br/>\nmeant directly for this dad.  In other words, she wasn&#39;t just  <br/>\nventing, she was bitching at him.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I knew where she was coming from and have much experience with  <br/>\nher in these types of outbursts within our own family and close  <br/>\nfriends who seem to understand her a bit more, but this was someone  <br/>\nnew in our lives and I just didn&#39;t know what to do.  I went over to  <br/>\nher and found out what was wrong, although I already knew.  I  <br/>\nexpressed to her the way she spoke to the dad was unacceptable and  <br/>\nshe owed him an apology.  Well I haven&#39;t done this in quite a while.   <br/>\nI can&#39;t stand the &quot;now say your sorry in a sing-song voice but don&#39;t  <br/>\nreally mean it&quot; apology.  But I really felt in this instance, she  <br/>\nowed him an apology.  I have been asking myself lately (thanks to  <br/>\nsome great advice) &quot;would I say this to or ask this of my husband or  <br/>\na friend&quot; and I have to answer in this situation - yes.  If my friend  <br/>\nacted that way to another one of our friends, i think I would say  <br/>\n&quot;girl, you owe him an apology&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo anyhow, dd doesn&#39;t like to be put on the spot, especially with  <br/>\nsomeone she isn&#39;t familiar with.  I have her come back over with me  <br/>\nto the table and sit beside of me (across from him) and ask her when  <br/>\nshe is ready she can apologize.  At this point I just feel awful.  I  <br/>\ndo not like what i am doing with her, but feel like I had gotten  <br/>\nmyself into a situation I didn&#39;t know how to get out of.  While she  <br/>\nwas sitting, the dad and I continue on with our game and she starts  <br/>\ncrying.  She doesn&#39;t want to talk to him.  I probably wouldn&#39;t either  <br/>\nif I were in her situation (yes, I know the situation that I  <br/>\ncreated).  Finally I told her that if she would like to write it on  <br/>\npaper that would be fine, she didn&#39;t have to talk to him.  A few  <br/>\nminutes passed and she wrote it down and I gave it to him and he  <br/>\nwrote her a sweet note back.  Dd and I hugged and then she ran off  <br/>\nand stated playing like nothing had happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you handle this?  When your child is rude to another.  And I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t mean they forgot to say please, but really really nasty with  <br/>\nanother person.  A similar situation happened (not this the whole  <br/>\napologizing thing, but rude behavior) when we were staying at my in- <br/>\nlaws for the night and my two boys were taking a bath together in  <br/>\nGrandma and Grandpa&#39;s big giant wonderful tub in their perfect  <br/>\nhouse.  &lt;g&gt;  They were getting wilder and wilder and the water was  <br/>\nslashing wider and higher making big spots all over their non-tiled  <br/>\nwalls and I repeatedly asked them to calm down, made a bunch of idle  <br/>\nthreats and finally because my FIL was about to have a coronary in  <br/>\nthe other room, I turned into mean mommy and the rest of the night  <br/>\nwas a disaster.<br/>\n<br/>\nShould I have certain standards or expectations or whatever when it  <br/>\ncomes to other people and their stuff and how my kids treat them?  I  <br/>\nknow in both situations and other similar ones, part of MY problem is  <br/>\nthat I feel as if I am being heavily judged by the offended person  <br/>\nand there is a part of me that worries what they think of how I am  <br/>\nhandling the situation.  The other part of me just doesn&#39;t care, but  <br/>\nmostly I wonder &quot;are there limits&quot;?
