We were in a beautiful meadow,  <br/>\nsitting on the ground along a long table laid out low, with &quot;dragon&#39;s  <br/>\ntail (ham in a big pastry with scales) and other artsy food.  There  <br/>\nwere probably 45 of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things on the table was miniature cheese rounds in red wax,  <br/>\nand yellow wax.   So one of the ladies at our end of the table made a  <br/>\nrose with her wax, and we passed it down to the queen who was sitting  <br/>\nmid-table, with a message that we challenged the other end of the  <br/>\ntable to a contest.   When the message  reached the other end of the  <br/>\ntable, they whooped and scrambled.<br/>\n<br/>\nI leaned over and looked down there and WHAT A MISTAKE we had made.    <br/>\nThey had three professional artists--and SCULPTORS, carvers,  <br/>\njewelers.  And they had four or so great amateurs.   I looked around  <br/>\nour end.  Musicans, singers, writers.   So we quickly made a  <br/>\nconcession song and sang it with a harmony after they passed around  <br/>\ntheir entries, which included a mermaid, a dragon and a sea serpent in  <br/>\ntwo colors with a giant red wax penis (well, giant for the size of the  <br/>\nsea serpent)--they were doing two-color things with minute details.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we sang something that ended &quot;...Puffed and wheezed and cut their  <br/>\ncheese, and so we let them win.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s when I learned the equivalent of &quot;never start a lettering war  <br/>\nwith a letterer.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":272603634,"authorName":"Melissa Wiley","from":"Melissa Wiley &lt;thebonnyglen@...&gt;","profile":"glencaraid","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"speaking of &quot;always learning&quot;","postDate":"1240866105","msgId":44367,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI0NmI1NzhmMDkwNDI3MTQwMXAyMmJlNzJmZHYxZTRiZWZhNGYwMDUzZmJAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":44368,"prevInTime":44366,"nextInTime":44368,"topicId":44367,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I got emails from my mother and my husband this morning that made me think about this list--about people always learning. :) My mother wrote that she s ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1908522783\">I got emails from my mother and my husband this morning that made me think<br/>\nabout this list--about people always learning. :) My mother wrote that she&#39;s<br/>\nstudying for a test she&#39;s taking for her job--a test to become a &quot;certified<br/>\nanti-money-laundering specialist.&quot; She made a joke about how it&#39;s just what<br/>\nshe always dreamed of being when she was a little girl. It isn&#39;t, but she<br/>\nreally enjoys her job, which has to do with banking and computers.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is a comic-book editor. He sent me a jpg of a page of comic book<br/>\nart that came across his desk today. It&#39;s part of a monthly issue of one of<br/>\nhis series. Scott (his last name is Peterson, which comes into the story)<br/>\ngot the pages from the letterer, which means they had already been<br/>\npencilled, inked, and colored. Scott forwarded the colored pages on to the<br/>\npenciller and letterer for review before he had a chance to review them<br/>\nhimself. (As editor, a big part of his job is going over everything at each<br/>\nstage of the process, from script to printed book.) A little while later the<br/>\npenciller called him, laughing, wondering if he&#39;d seen page 8 yet. Scott<br/>\nhadn&#39;t. He cracked up when he did look--in one panel there&#39;s an old-timey<br/>\nmovie poster stuck to a telephone pole, and the letterer had added, as a<br/>\njoke, a word balloon with the words &quot;Scott Peterson is dreamy&quot; coming out of<br/>\nthe starlet&#39;s mouth. There&#39;s a bunch of other dialogue on the page, so you<br/>\ndon&#39;t notice at first glance; you have to actually read the balloons and<br/>\nthen it&#39;s really funny.<br/>\n<br/>\nScott showed the whole thing to me, and we were laughing about it. He said<br/>\nthe really funny part is that when he was ballooning the issue (marking<br/>\nwhere the word balloons should go before the letterer does the lettering),<br/>\nHE had stuck a joke balloon in that spot so the starlet was saying &quot;I love<br/>\n[letterer&#39;s name].&quot; (I forget the guy&#39;s name.)  Scott wrote me, &quot;Never start<br/>\na lettering war with a letterer&quot; and it made me laugh, because that is<br/>\ndefinitely something they don&#39;t teach you in school!<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth their stories, my mom&#39;s and Scott&#39;s, struck me as examples of how real<br/>\nlife can take us places that have nothing to do with what we did in school,<br/>\nand how there is always something new to know.<br/>\n<br/>\nLissa in San Diego, mom of six<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44303,"nextTopicId":44375}}
