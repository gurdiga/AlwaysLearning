I appreciate that you and others are willing to share it.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve benefitted so much from what I&#39;ve learned from parents of kids  <br/>\nwith more extreme behaviors - my own kids are VERY intense and  <br/>\nprobably could have been diagnosed with various things if they&#39;d been  <br/>\nin school. But I&#39;ve paid attention - when people talk about kids who  <br/>\nhave nerves that seem to be quickly rubbed raw in social situations,  <br/>\nfor example, I listened to how people helped their kids and supported  <br/>\nthem AS THEY ARE. I used much of what I learned with my own kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - there are so MANY kids with autistic spectrum behaviors - I&#39;m  <br/>\nnot sure how anybody these days would not have friends who are  <br/>\nautistic or have autistic kids. Not that it makes anybody responsible  <br/>\nfor educating others about it, but that we ALL have a vested interest  <br/>\nin understanding how to relate to people with autistic spectrum  <br/>\nbehaviors as the real, complete, wonderful people that they are.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":67247159,"authorName":"Nanci Kuykendall","from":"Nanci Kuykendall &lt;aisliin@...&gt;","profile":"aisliin","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"[AlwaysLearning] Rules vs Principles","postDate":"1136499649","msgId":23801,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwMTA1MjIyMDQ5LjkyMTQ4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUxOTAxLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDExMzY0ODgwNDguMjE1OS42NDgxMy5tNkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":23813,"prevInTime":23800,"nextInTime":23802,"topicId":23801,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... apply those principles in our very-different ... to a deeper understanding OF those basic principles. -pam I appreciate your comments Pam.

That&#39;s pretty much<br/>\nwhy I shared what I did to begin with, and why I<br/>\nshared it here.  I have been on Shine for quite a<br/>\nwhile now, and have had some discussions there that<br/>\nI&#39;ve been involved in.  It is a very good thing to<br/>\nhave the supportive understanding of a group of folks<br/>\nwith special needs kids who are unschooling, in the<br/>\nsame way as it&#39;s a good thing to have the support of<br/>\nunschooler here.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure others here can relate, having an atypical<br/>\nparenting style, to how it gets exhausting to always<br/>\nhave to educate others in social groups or public<br/>\nsetings who come questioning you and to be a poster<br/>\nchild for unschooling and how it can also be so<br/>\nrefreshing to have someone just totally &quot;get it&quot; and<br/>\nbe on the same page with you.  It&#39;s to a much greater<br/>\ndegree with special needs kids, because it&#39;s more<br/>\nobvious generally and people come up to you in places<br/>\nlike the supermarket and get all sanctimonious and<br/>\njudgemental on you because they see your apparently<br/>\n&quot;normal&quot; 9 year old down on the floor having a<br/>\ntantrum, or hear them speak to you in a way that<br/>\nothers percieve as rude, or because your child is<br/>\ndoing some other thing that irks someone.  I know a<br/>\nnumber of folks who carry or have recommended to me to<br/>\ncarry a small card to hand people saying that my child<br/>\nhas special needs and I appreciate their patience,<br/>\nsupport and understanding (even if those people are<br/>\nshowing none of those things.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been on various other unschooling lists as well. <br/>\nHowever bar none this list, Alwayslearning, has been<br/>\nthe best unschooling support list for me all around,<br/>\nmore so than Shine.  I&#39;ve been here since this list<br/>\nwas started (I remember asking why it was so quiet and<br/>\nbeing told that no one was here yet, lol - oh!) as a<br/>\nspinoff from another list, and have always found this<br/>\nto be an opinionated and honest, fair, sincere and<br/>\nthoughtful group of folks with a lot of great<br/>\nexperience to share, masterfully lead by Sandra with<br/>\nher mostly hands off approach to list management.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to share here how we struggle with the<br/>\nphilisophical and practical applications of our<br/>\nprinciples in unschooling our special needs kids, and<br/>\nI&#39;m glad that I did because I can see that it has so<br/>\nfar been a beneficial discussion to members here both<br/>\nwith and without special needs kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have learned a HUGE, HUGE amount from parenting my<br/>\nkids and I am so thankful that they are who they are. <br/>\nNo regrets, no searching for &quot;cures&quot; to make them<br/>\n&quot;normal.&quot;  On thing I have learned from them is to<br/>\nrelax and not stress over things that a lot of parents<br/>\nstress over.
