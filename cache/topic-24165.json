If reading  (inability) is  <br/>\nstressful, reading to him and playing games that involve reading will  <br/>\nbe a reminder.  Does he like movies?  You didn&#39;t mention movies.     <br/>\nYou can discuss the same ideas, art, language, plot, character, drama/ <br/>\ncomedy you could discuss after reading a book if you do it after a  <br/>\nmovie.  Maybe you could do a theme (one movie at a time, letting his  <br/>\npreferences change the plan anytime).  If he liked Charlie and the  <br/>\nChocolate Factory, that could go toward more movies by the same  <br/>\ndirector (Nightmare Before Christmas, Beetlejuice, Peewee&#39;s Big  <br/>\nAdventure) or to other Johnny Depp or to other special effects movies.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou didn&#39;t mention music.  Might he like musicals?  Little Shop of  <br/>\nHorrors?  Wizard of Oz?  Peter Pan with Martin?
