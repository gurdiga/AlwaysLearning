The <br/>\ndeadline is the last day of the month. Here&#39;s the main link for <br/>\ndetails and past editions:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/2007/01/unschooling-voices-\">http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/2007/01/unschooling-voices-</a><br/>\nmain-page.html<br/>\n(If the link doesn&#39;t click, copy and paste it into your browser)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe optional question for this month is:<br/>\nUnschooling through the ages: How, if at all, does unschooling look <br/>\ndifferent as your child ages and grows. Is it different now than it <br/>\nwas a few years back? What role does age play in unschooling? <br/>\n<br/>\nLast edition there were 32 posts submitted (32!!!) from unschoolers <br/>\nat different stages of their unschooling journey. Lots of visitors <br/>\nfound new blogs to read and were inspired to move forward and reach <br/>\nout and help someone who needed some words of wisdom. <br/>\n<br/>\nCome join us!<br/>\n<br/>\n~~ Joanne ~~</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31534,"nextTopicId":31527}}
