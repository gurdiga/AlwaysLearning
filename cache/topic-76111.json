Try to relax. Many kids go through food jags where they \nwant nothing but peanut butter crackers, or nothing but pepperoni pizza. One of my kids ate pretty much nothing but cereal for the longest time (his choice). Then it was PB&amp;J. He eats lots of foods now, though, and is a healthy adult. <br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1989544167yui_3_16_0_1_1441073893780_17820\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1989544167\" dir=\"ltr\"><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1989544167yui_3_16_0_1_1441073893780_17701\" dir=\"ltr\">When my child was yelling or hitting, I&#39;d walk away.

We are sweet and close most of the time, *except* for when he is hungry or if I am coaching him about yelling at me and throwing things (when he is hungry). *If* he is reacting to a bad feeling in his gut from eating foods that don&#39;t agree with him, we feel trapped in this dynamic.

But you came here to ask us about occupational therapy, instead of asking your unschooling question for the first time, clearly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the course of this exchange, it seems you&#39;re rejecting ideas without taking time to try them.

There is a lot of stuff between you and your child, I think.  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://livingjoyfully.ca/newsletter/\">http://livingjoyfully.ca/newsletter/</a><br/>\nIt will take a few weeks.  Please go to a buffet half a dozen times in there.  It&#39;s cheaper than occupational therapy, and don&#39;t involve other people.  Be directly with your family, in a smiling, non-pressured, peaceful way, as often as possible.  With practice, it can be almost continuous, day and night, for years.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":284087656,"authorName":"","from":"semajrak@...","profile":"semajrak","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Occupational Therapy","postDate":"1440972432","msgId":76132,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG1ydnVxZysybzZhZTBAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDU4QTYxRUJBLTZBMTAtNDNFOS1CRjA1LTdFOTFFQTg4OEFCREB5YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PENBUHYrY1l3QUUyQjNmRGFneERCLUErX2VwSkVQV3FiaU84MDRpMmJ1R1Zhb1pFTjBIUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDIzQjdFQUMzLTUxMEEtNDFGRS1BMDRGLUQ1RERDRjAxRkVDOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPENBUHYrY1l6RzRPckN4OXphckQrcTN0ZzdDPUNCRURSLWRfVVBpYmY9PTdIR2ljeXVmd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JPDU4QTYxRUJBLTZBMTAtNDNFOS1CRjA1LTdFOTFFQTg4OEFCREB5YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":76130,"nextInTopic":76133,"prevInTime":76131,"nextInTime":76133,"topicId":76111,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My son recently asked for a small fridge beside his desk where he has his computer.

I sit in on every appointment. I&#39;m the only parent there who does that, which I don&#39;t understand. I want to know what&#39;s going on. One of his therapists cheated at Chutes and Ladders, gloated when she won, and told my son no one would want to play with him if he wasn&#39;t a better sport. Not sure I would have believed that if i hadn&#39;t seen it myself. &nbsp;Things have improved since I&#39;ve insisted that they limit his therapy to exactly what he&#39;s there for. &nbsp;(From what I see in the lobby, a lot of parents are using the therapists to help with behavioral issues at home.

I didn&#39;t ask for that!&quot; If I do something wrong, like buy the wrong cheese or make a suggestion, he throws things and storms away and won&#39;t eat anything at all. The disproportionate reactions are part of the reason I think there may be deeper issues here. Last year was very hard on our family - I was dangerously ill and in the hospital and he spent a lot of time with grandparents. While he had fun, I know his grandparents are fairly conventional and he may have felt bullied about food. I don&#39;t know - he has never said and neither have any of them, but they definitely perceive his eating as &quot;picky&quot; and aren&#39;t open to radical solutions (like making a second dish if the first was wrong, or supporting him to eat separately or watching youtubes, or all the many things I do to be his partner).<br><br></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1559491269gmail_extra\">We do these things: walking down the aisles and let him put anything in the cart, making all foods available, not pressuring him, but even things he picks out he later rejects, angrily or sadly. &quot;Save it,&quot; he&#39;ll say, or &quot;I do like it, but I just don&#39;t want it right now,&quot; but he doesn&#39;t eat it later, either. He stands at the fridge or the cupboard, or looks at the list he made of foods he says he likes, and none of them appeal. </div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1559491269gmail_extra\"><br></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1559491269gmail_extra\">If there is something I am misunderstanding about monkey platters or the other advice offered, I hope it will become clear in this conversation because I am operating under the assumption that there is no problem except for one that I create and yet he is hungry, underweight and sad about the lack of pleasing food options.<br>\n<br>\n-Why don&#39;t you NOT go to a therapist, but give him the food he wants \nwithout pressure, without anything to distress him or to make him angry?-<br></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1559491269gmail_extra\">I would prefer that, and if there is another way to do that than what I am doing, I want to know. I buy anything he asks for, I anticipate, I am respectful, I am available, I cook anything, I include him or not as he prefers, I don&#39;t call anything &quot;junk&quot; or empty calories, I don&#39;t push him to try anything. I make the few foods he eats, but if they are wrong in any way, or if I am unable to because we are out of something, he just doesn&#39;t eat. When we are anywhere besides home, it is very challenging, and if he is anyone else&#39;s care I have to pack a lot of groceries and debrief the caregiver, and <i>still</i> sometimes he won&#39;t eat anything. <br><br></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1559491269gmail_extra\">I haven&#39;t controlled food in the past. His older brother eats a wide variety of foods. When Lysander, the 5 1/2 yo, was a baby (8months), I was suddenly hospitalized and unable to breastfeed. He received donor milk but it was extremely traumatic - there wasn&#39;t enough the first day. He was hungry and abandoned. It has always been a challenge to find foods he likes that fill him up, but it seems to have gotten harder in the past year since I was hospitalized extensively again. <br></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1559491269gmail_extra\"><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1559491269gmail_quote\"><br><blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-1559491269gmail_quote\" style=\"margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-left:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);\"><div style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\"><div><div><br><div style=\"margin-top:10px;\"><hr style=\"min-height:2px;border-width:0px;color:rgb(227,227,227);background-color:rgb(227,227,227);\">\n     </div>\n    <div> </div>\n\n    <table style=\"margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:10px;color:rgb(45,80,253);\" cellspacing=\"4px\">\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"font-size:12px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:7px 5px 5px;\">\n                          <a rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"text-decoration:none;color:rgb(45,80,253);\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/AlwaysLearning/conversations/messages/76112;_ylc=X3oDMTJxbHNwOXN0BF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzQ0MTAyNTAEZ3Jwc3BJZAMxNzA1NTQyMTExBG1zZ0lkAzc2MTEyBHNlYwNmdHIEc2xrA3JwbHkEc3RpbWUDMTQ0MDkwOTg1Nw--?act=reply&amp;messageNum=76112\">Reply via web post</a>\n                      </td>\n          <td>•</td>\n          <td style=\"font-size:12px;font-family:arial;padding:7px 5px 5px;\">\n            <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...?subject=Re%3A%20%5BAlwaysLearning%5D%20Occupational%20Therapy\" style=\"text-decoration:none;color:rgb(45,80,253);\">\n               Reply to sender            </a>\n          </td>\n          <td>•</td>\n          <td style=\"font-size:12px;font-family:arial;padding:7px 5px 5px;\">\n            <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com?subject=Re%3A%20%5BAlwaysLearning%5D%20Occupational%20Therapy\" style=\"text-decoration:none;color:rgb(45,80,253);\">\n              Reply to group            </a>\n          </td>\n          <td>•</td>\n          <td style=\"font-size:12px;font-family:arial;padding:7px 5px 5px;\">\n            <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/AlwaysLearning/conversations/newtopic;_ylc=X3oDMTJlMDNlZmlsBF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzQ0MTAyNTAEZ3Jwc3BJZAMxNzA1NTQyMTExBHNlYwNmdHIEc2xrA250cGMEc3RpbWUDMTQ0MDkwOTg1Nw--\" style=\"text-decoration:none;color:rgb(45,80,253);\">Start a New Topic</a>\n          </td>\n          <td>•</td>\n          <td style=\"font-size:12px;font-family:arial;padding:7px 5px 5px;color:rgb(45,80,253);\">\n                            <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/AlwaysLearning/conversations/topics/76111;_ylc=X3oDMTM2NW11ZHU0BF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzQ0MTAyNTAEZ3Jwc3BJZAMxNzA1NTQyMTExBG1zZ0lkAzc2MTEyBHNlYwNmdHIEc2xrA3Z0cGMEc3RpbWUDMTQ0MDkwOTg1NwR0cGNJZAM3NjExMQ--\" style=\"text-decoration:none;color:rgb(45,80,253);\">Messages in this topic</a>\n                (2)\n                      </td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n<div style=\"background-color:rgb(242,242,242);font-family:Verdana;font-size:10px;margin-bottom:10px;padding:10px;\">\n\n    <span style=\"font-weight:bold;color:rgb(51,51,51);text-transform:uppercase;\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/AlwaysLearning/info;_ylc=X3oDMTJlNmdrdWNpBF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzQ0MTAyNTAEZ3Jwc3BJZAMxNzA1NTQyMTExBHNlYwN2dGwEc2xrA3ZnaHAEc3RpbWUDMTQ0MDkwOTg1Nw--\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Visit Your Group</a></span>\n\n     <ul style=\"list-style-type:none;margin:0px;padding:0px;\">\n            <li style=\"border-right:1px solid rgb(0,0,0);font-weight:700;padding:0px 5px;margin-left:0px;\">\n      <span><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/AlwaysLearning/members/all;_ylc=X3oDMTJmc24zdWcyBF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzQ0MTAyNTAEZ3Jwc3BJZAMxNzA1NTQyMTExBHNlYwN2dGwEc2xrA3ZtYnJzBHN0aW1lAzE0NDA5MDk4NTc-\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">New Members</a></span>\n      <span style=\"color:rgb(255,121,0);\">4</span>\n    </li>\n                                              </ul>\n  </div>\n\n\n<div style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:11px;margin-top:5px;padding:0px 2px 0px 0px;\">\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://groups.yahoo.com/neo;_ylc=X3oDMTJkbnRvZnE0BF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzQ0MTAyNTAEZ3Jwc3BJZAMxNzA1NTQyMTExBHNlYwNmdHIEc2xrA2dmcARzdGltZQMxNDQwOTA5ODU3\" style=\"float:left;\"><img src=\"https://ec.yimg.com/ec?url=http%3A%2F%2Fl.yimg.com%2Fru%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fyg%2Fimg%2Femail%2Fnew_logo%2Flogo-groups-137x15.png&t=1571493479&sig=1HdTWEpEXN0E2u4lQ227WA--~E\" alt=\"Yahoo!

I didn&#39;t ask for that!&quot; If I do something wrong, like buy the wrong cheese or make a suggestion, he throws things and storms away and won&#39;t eat anything at all. The disproportionate reactions are part of the reason I think there may be deeper issues here. Last year was very hard on our family - I was dangerously ill and in the hospital and he spent a lot of time with grandparents. While he had fun, I know his grandparents are fairly conventional and he may have felt bullied about food. I don&#39;t know - he has never said and neither have any of them, but they definitely perceive his eating as &quot;picky&quot; and aren&#39;t open to radical solutions (like making a second dish if the first was wrong, or supporting him to eat separately or watching youtubes, or all the many things I do to be his partner).<br><br></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1770609397gmail_extra\">We do these things: walking down the aisles and let him put anything in the cart, making all foods available, not pressuring him, but even things he picks out he later rejects, angrily or sadly. &quot;Save it,&quot; he&#39;ll say, or &quot;I do like it, but I just don&#39;t want it right now,&quot; but he doesn&#39;t eat it later, either. He stands at the fridge or the cupboard, or looks at the list he made of foods he says he likes, and none of them appeal. </div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1770609397gmail_extra\"><br></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1770609397gmail_extra\">If there is something I am misunderstanding about monkey platters or the other advice offered, I hope it will become clear in this conversation because I am operating under the assumption that there is no problem except for one that I create and yet he is hungry, underweight and sad about the lack of pleasing food options.<br>\n<br>\n-Why don&#39;t you NOT go to a therapist, but give him the food he wants \nwithout pressure, without anything to distress him or to make him angry?-<br></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1770609397gmail_extra\">I would prefer that, and if there is another way to do that than what I am doing, I want to know. I buy anything he asks for, I anticipate, I am respectful, I am available, I cook anything, I include him or not as he prefers, I don&#39;t call anything &quot;junk&quot; or empty calories, I don&#39;t push him to try anything. I make the few foods he eats, but if they are wrong in any way, or if I am unable to because we are out of something, he just doesn&#39;t eat. When we are anywhere besides home, it is very challenging, and if he is anyone else&#39;s care I have to pack a lot of groceries and debrief the caregiver, and <i>still</i> sometimes he won&#39;t eat anything. <br><br></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1770609397gmail_extra\">I haven&#39;t controlled food in the past. His older brother eats a wide variety of foods. When Lysander, the 5 1/2 yo, was a baby (8months), I was suddenly hospitalized and unable to breastfeed. He received donor milk but it was extremely traumatic - there wasn&#39;t enough the first day. He was hungry and abandoned.

I didn&#39;t ask for that!&quot; If I do something wrong, like buy the wrong cheese or make a suggestion, he throws things and storms away and won&#39;t eat anything at all. The disproportionate reactions are part of the reason I think there may be deeper issues here. Last year was very hard on our family - I was dangerously ill and in the hospital and he spent a lot of time with grandparents. While he had fun, I know his grandparents are fairly conventional and he may have felt bullied about food. I don&#39;t know - he has never said and neither have any of them, but they definitely perceive his eating as &quot;picky&quot; and aren&#39;t open to radical solutions (like making a second dish if the first was wrong, or supporting him to eat separately or watching youtubes, or all the many things I do to be his partner).<br><br></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1193983115gmail_extra\">We do these things: walking down the aisles and let him put anything in the cart, making all foods available, not pressuring him, but even things he picks out he later rejects, angrily or sadly. &quot;Save it,&quot; he&#39;ll say, or &quot;I do like it, but I just don&#39;t want it right now,&quot; but he doesn&#39;t eat it later, either. He stands at the fridge or the cupboard, or looks at the list he made of foods he says he likes, and none of them appeal. </div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1193983115gmail_extra\"><br></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1193983115gmail_extra\">If there is something I am misunderstanding about monkey platters or the other advice offered, I hope it will become clear in this conversation because I am operating under the assumption that there is no problem except for one that I create and yet he is hungry, underweight and sad about the lack of pleasing food options.<br>\n<br>\n-Why don&#39;t you NOT go to a therapist, but give him the food he wants \nwithout pressure, without anything to distress him or to make him angry?-<br></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1193983115gmail_extra\">I would prefer that, and if there is another way to do that than what I am doing, I want to know. I buy anything he asks for, I anticipate, I am respectful, I am available, I cook anything, I include him or not as he prefers, I don&#39;t call anything &quot;junk&quot; or empty calories, I don&#39;t push him to try anything. I make the few foods he eats, but if they are wrong in any way, or if I am unable to because we are out of something, he just doesn&#39;t eat. When we are anywhere besides home, it is very challenging, and if he is anyone else&#39;s care I have to pack a lot of groceries and debrief the caregiver, and <i>still</i> sometimes he won&#39;t eat anything. <br><br></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1193983115gmail_extra\">I haven&#39;t controlled food in the past. His older brother eats a wide variety of foods. When Lysander, the 5 1/2 yo, was a baby (8months), I was suddenly hospitalized and unable to breastfeed. He received donor milk but it was extremely traumatic - there wasn&#39;t enough the first day. He was hungry and abandoned.
