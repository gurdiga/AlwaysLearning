My<br/>\nyounger brother got me started watching manga and reading anime and it is<br/>\none of my favorite things to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of manga and manhwa, there are stories that are one volume and even<br/>\nshort stories, but most stories I&#39;ve read are long.  They typically have a<br/>\nchapter published in a weekly (or monthly) magazine with comics.  Later on<br/>\nyou can buy the bound volumes with just one story (the way you typically buy<br/>\nthem here), but that is not how it is originally published.  Some stories<br/>\nend suddenly because the serialization is cancelled and those can have rapid<br/>\nendings that aren&#39;t that great, and some are really successful and seem to<br/>\nstall and drag it out a little too long with what seem like filler.   Those<br/>\ncan be some of the disadvantages of serialization, but it probably also<br/>\nmeans that it is easier for the publisher to try out a new author on the<br/>\npublic.  Most of the stories are a great length, but I think that it is<br/>\ninteresting to see how serialization can make   Lots of GREAT stories of all<br/>\ndifferent lengths out there and I really enjoy them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Japanese and Korean TV shows that I watch are serial stories.   Not all<br/>\nof their shows are like this, but I think a lot of the prime time live<br/>\naction (vs. animated) shows are.  The Korean shows are typically 16-24<br/>\nepisodes and an hour long (w/o commercials).  They have some historical<br/>\ndramas that are more like 50 episodes, but I haven&#39;t gotten in to them yet.<br/>\nI like comedies.  Japanese shows seem to be shorter (40min, if I remember<br/>\ncorrectly) and more like 10-12 episodes.

The stories in the film serials  <br/>\nwould continue for weeks (15 it says below was typical). I know about  <br/>\nFlash Gordon and Buck Rogers just from reading about the early days  <br/>\nof science fiction but I guess the most popular were Westerns. Those  <br/>\nSaturday matinees were also the source of the great Bugs Bunny  <br/>\ncartoons :-) (And loads of other cartoons from that era.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the audience for continuing stories was there, and an  <br/>\nunderstanding that continuing stories could be popular, but, for  <br/>\nwhatever reason, the TV studios didn&#39;t trust that people would (or  <br/>\ncould) come back for a continuing story line. Or didn&#39;t trust that  <br/>\nthe audience would join in on a show with a continuing story line.  <br/>\nAnd it wasn&#39;t until recently that the studios trusted more complex  <br/>\nstories would actually hold an audience. Or, perhaps, with cable and  <br/>\nall the choices, they found that to hold an audience, they had to  <br/>\ncreate a need to come back or people wouldn&#39;t show up week after week.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s funny, I saw Hill Street Blues when it first aired and thought  <br/>\n&quot;Wow!&quot; about the interwoven stories, but now it&#39;s &quot;eh&quot;, pretty  <br/>\nstandard. ;-) (But they were pioneers! :-) And now, when I rewatch  <br/>\nBuffy, though each episode is pretty self contained, the ones that  <br/>\nwere outside of the ongoing story arc tend to feel flat. And when I  <br/>\nwas growing up, that&#39;s the only kind of TV story telling we had!

Known as &quot;chapter plays,&quot; they were extended  <br/>\n&gt; motion pictures broken into a number of segments called &quot;chapters&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; or &quot;episodes.&quot; Each chapter (a typical serial usually had as many  <br/>\n&gt; as 15 of them) would be screened at the same theater for one week.  <br/>\n&gt; The serial would end with a cliffhanger, as the hero and heroine  <br/>\n&gt; would find themselves in the latest perilous situation from which  <br/>\n&gt; there could be no escape. The audience would have to return the  <br/>\n&gt; next week (and pay admission) to find out how the hero and heroine  <br/>\n&gt; would escape and battle the villain once again. Serials were  <br/>\n&gt; especially popular with children, and for many youths in the first  <br/>\n&gt; half of the 20th century, a typical Saturday at the movies included  <br/>\n&gt; a chapter of at least one serial, along with animated cartoons,  <br/>\n&gt; newsreels, and two feature films.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Most serials were Westerns, since those were the least expensive to  <br/>\n&gt; film. Besides Westerns, though, there were films covering many  <br/>\n&gt; genres, including crime fiction, espionage, comic book or comic  <br/>\n&gt; strip characters, science fiction, and jungle adventures. Although  <br/>\n&gt; most serials were filmed economically, some were made at  <br/>\n&gt; significant expense. The Flash Gordon serial and its sequels, for  <br/>\n&gt; instance, were major productions in their times.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliffhanger\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliffhanger</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The idea of ending a tale at a point where the audience is left in  <br/>\n&gt; suspense as to its conclusion (which is then given at another time)  <br/>\n&gt; has been a staple part of storytelling for almost as long as the  <br/>\n&gt; idea of stories have existed. It is a central theme and framing  <br/>\n&gt; device of the collection of stories known as the One Thousand And  <br/>\n&gt; One Nights, wherein the queen Scheherazade, who is facing a morning  <br/>\n&gt; execution on the orders of her husband King Shahryar, devises the  <br/>\n&gt; solution of telling him a story but leaving it at a cliffhanger,  <br/>\n&gt; thus forcing the king to postpone her execution in order to hear  <br/>\n&gt; the rest of the tale.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The term &#39;cliffhanger&#39; is considered to have originated with Thomas  <br/>\n&gt; Hardy&#39;s serial novel &quot;A Pair of Blue Eyes&quot; in 1873. At the time  <br/>\n&gt; newspapers published novels in a serial format with one chapter  <br/>\n&gt; appearing every month. In order to ensure continued interest in the  <br/>\n&gt; story many authors employed different authorial techniques; in the  <br/>\n&gt; aforementioned novel Hardy chose to leave one of his protagonists,  <br/>\n&gt; Knight, literally hanging off a cliff staring into the stony eyes  <br/>\n&gt; of a trilobite embedded in the rock that has been dead for millions  <br/>\n&gt; of years. This became the archetypal — and literal — cliff-hanger  <br/>\n&gt; of Victorian prose.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Once Hardy created it, all serial writers used the cliff-hanger  <br/>\n&gt; even though Trollope felt that the use of suspense violated &quot;all  <br/>\n&gt; proper confidence between the author and his reader.&quot; Basically,  <br/>\n&gt; the reader would expect &quot;delightful horrors&quot; only to feel betrayed  <br/>\n&gt; with a much less exciting ending. Despite the rhetorical distaste  <br/>\n&gt; all serial authors used the cliffhanger and Wilkie Collins is  <br/>\n&gt; famous for saying about the technique: &quot;Make &#39;em cry, make &#39;em  <br/>\n&gt; laugh, make &#39;em wait – exactly in that order.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Collins is famous for the Sensation Novel which heavily relied upon  <br/>\n&gt; the cliffhanger. Some examples of his endings include:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;The next witnesses called were witnesses concerned with the  <br/>\n&gt; question that now followed--the obscure and terrible question: Who  <br/>\n&gt; Poisoned Her? (The Law and the Lady) &quot;Why are we to stop her, sir?  <br/>\n&gt; What has she done?&quot; &quot;Done! She has escaped from my Asylum. Don&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; forget; a woman in white. Drive on.&quot; (The Woman in White) &quot;You can  <br/>\n&gt; marry me privately today,&quot; she answered. &quot;Listen--and I will tell  <br/>\n&gt; you how!&quot; (Man and Wife)&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This anticipation and conversation inducing authorial technique  <br/>\n&gt; would often be very contrived as the only purpose was to maintain  <br/>\n&gt; interest in the monthly serial. Therefore, these were regularly  <br/>\n&gt; removed from the plot when the serial was published as a full novel.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The cliff-hanger was converted into film and is best known from the  <br/>\n&gt; very popular silent film series The Perils of Pauline (1914), shown  <br/>\n&gt; in weekly instalments and featuring Pearl White as the title  <br/>\n&gt; character, a perpetual damsel in distress who was menaced by  <br/>\n&gt; assorted villains, with each instalment ending with her placed in a  <br/>\n&gt; situation that looked sure to result in her imminent death – to  <br/>\n&gt; escape at the beginning of the next instalment only to get into  <br/>\n&gt; fresh danger at its end. Specifically, an episode filmed around the  <br/>\n&gt; New Jersey Palisades ended with her literally left hanging over a  <br/>\n&gt; cliff and seeming about to fall.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Joyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":183568025,"authorName":"Bob Collier","from":"&quot;Bob Collier&quot; &lt;bobcollier@...&gt;","profile":"quaussiebob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Not choosing books","postDate":"1208663293","msgId":34405,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZ1ZWVkdCtlOW9xQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZ1YWxiaytuZzYzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":34400,"nextInTopic":34409,"prevInTime":34404,"nextInTime":34406,"topicId":34371,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The first  <br/>\nreal prime time soap opera was ABC&#39;s Peyton Place (1964-1969), based  <br/>\nin part on the original 1957 movie (which was itself taken from the  <br/>\n1956 novel). The popularity of Peyton Place prompted rival network  <br/>\nCBS to spin off popular As the World Turns character Lisa Miller  <br/>\nGrimaldi into her own evening soap opera entitled Our Private World  <br/>\n(originally titled &quot;The Woman Lisa&quot; in its planning stages) in 1965.  <br/>\nOur Private World ended in the fall and the character of Lisa  <br/>\nreturned to As The World Turns.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe structure of the Peyton Place with its episodic plots and long- <br/>\nrunning story arcs would set the mold for the prime time serials of  <br/>\nthe 1980s when the format reached its pinnacle.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe successful prime time serials of the 1980s included Dallas,  <br/>\nDynasty, Knots Landing and Falcon Crest. These shows frequently dealt  <br/>\nwith wealthy families and their personal and big-business travails.  <br/>\nCommon characteristics were sumptuous sets and costumes, the presence  <br/>\nof at least one glamorous bitch-figure in the cast of characters, and  <br/>\nspectacular disaster cliffhanger situations. Unlike daytime serials  <br/>\nwhich are shot on video in a studio using the multicamera setup,  <br/>\nthese evening series were shot on film using a single camera setup  <br/>\nand featured much location-shot footage, often in picturesque  <br/>\nlocales. Dallas, its spin-off Knots Landing, and Falcon Crest all  <br/>\ninitially featured episodes with self-contained stories and specific  <br/>\nguest stars who appeared in just that episode. Each story would be  <br/>\ncompletely resolved by the end of the episode and there were no end- <br/>\nof-episode cliffhangers. After the first couple of seasons all three  <br/>\nshows changed their story format to that of a pure soap opera with  <br/>\ninterwoven ongoing narratives that ran over several episodes. Dynasty  <br/>\nfeatured this format throughout its run.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe soap opera&#39;s distinctive open plot structure and complex  <br/>\ncontinuity also began to be increasingly incorporated into major  <br/>\nAmerican prime time television programs. The first significant drama  <br/>\nseries to do this was Hill Street Blues. This series, produced by  <br/>\nSteven Bochco, featured many elements borrowed from soap operas such  <br/>\nas an ensemble cast, multi-episode storylines and extensive character  <br/>\ndevelopment over the course of the series. It and the later Cagney &  <br/>\nLacey overlaid the police series formula with ongoing narratives  <br/>\nexploring the personal lives and interpersonal relationships of the  <br/>\nregular characters.[8] The success of these series prompted other  <br/>\ndrama series and situation comedy shows such as St. Elsewhere to  <br/>\nincorporate soap opera style stories and story structure to varying  <br/>\ndegrees. The legacy continues in more recent series such as The West  <br/>\nWing and Friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe prime time soap operas and drama series of the 1990s, such as  <br/>\nBeverly Hills 90210, Melrose Place, and Dawson&#39;s Creek, focused more  <br/>\non younger characters. In the 2000s, ABC began to revitalize the  <br/>\nprimetime soap opera format by premiering shows such as Alias,  <br/>\nDesperate Housewives, Grey&#39;s Anatomy, and Ugly Betty. These shows  <br/>\nmanaged to appeal to wide audiences not only because of their high  <br/>\nmelodrama but also because of the humor injected into the scripts and  <br/>\nplot lines. In the fall of 2007, many new primetime soaps premiered  <br/>\non U.S. television such as Dirty Sexy Money.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":199360242,"authorName":"graberamy","from":"&quot;graberamy&quot; &lt;graber@...&gt;","profile":"graberamy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Not choosing books","postDate":"1208573208","msgId":34384,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZ1Ym1lbys0NGlpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhBNEEyMkY3LTA4OUQtNDEyRC1CQ0YzLTM1OUNGQ0I4NDc2MkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":34375,"nextInTopic":34388,"prevInTime":34383,"nextInTime":34385,"topicId":34371,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

If  <br/>\nyou wanted a fantasy wednesday night, the only choices were books  <br/>\nwith a huge variety to choose from.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, of course, there&#39;s an explosion in story media and availability.  <br/>\nTiVo to watch whenever you want, series to buy, video games, books on  <br/>\ntape, even internet dramas :-) And they&#39;re becoming more  <br/>\nsophisticated. Though visual media are different from novels -- where  <br/>\nyou can get inside a character&#39;s head -- the story telling has  <br/>\nimproved dramatically just in the last 2 decades. I remember a post  <br/>\non a blog that pointed out how simple the stories were -- Twilight  <br/>\nZone not withstanding ;-) -- in weekly series up until the recent  <br/>\ndecades. The characters were exactly the same from week to week. The  <br/>\nonly time there were changes were when actors left or a real-life  <br/>\npregnancy had to be written in ;-) And usually the changes didn&#39;t  <br/>\nwork well because the series were set up to exist in a world where  <br/>\nnothing much changed.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you think about it, only &quot;stupid&quot; housewives were trusted with  <br/>\ncomplex storylines in their soaps ;-) And you can easily pick out the  <br/>\nshows where the producers were saying &quot;Trust us, people aren&#39;t as  <br/>\nmind numbed as you think!&quot; M*A*S*H*, Dallas (or was there a &quot;night  <br/>\ntime soap&quot; before that?), Hill Street Blues ...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlowly it&#39;s shifted to where we *expect* the characters and lives and  <br/>\nworlds in most TV shows to change. We&#39;re trusted to keep track of  <br/>\nmultiple ongoing story lines. While shows may not generally have  <br/>\nreached the level of nuanced storytelling of many of the literary  <br/>\nclassics, they&#39;re certainly as complex as Gone With the Wind. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember watching some Japanese imported cartoons back when I was a  <br/>\nkid (Kimba, Speed Racer, Star Blazers with no idea they came from  <br/>\nJapan) and feeling there was something special about them. I can look  <br/>\nback now and see that the writers trusted me to be able to follow an  <br/>\nongoing story line (even if they were dumbed down by the American  <br/>\nproducers for the stupid American kids ;-) And, goodness, what the  <br/>\nJapanese trust *they&#39;re* kids to handle is phenomenal: 300+ Pokemon,  <br/>\nhugely complex storylines starting with Dragonball and now the too- <br/>\ncomplex-for-adults Naruto and Bleach.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile visual storytelling may not be for everyone, I suspect it&#39;s  <br/>\nmore natural than following a story reading. But even so, have there  <br/>\never been so many books available?<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":294520986,"authorName":"Joanna Murphy","from":"&quot;Joanna Murphy&quot; &lt;ridingmom@...&gt;","profile":"ridingmom1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Not choosing books","postDate":"1208539316","msgId":34371,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZ1YWxiaytuZzYzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":34372,"prevInTime":34370,"nextInTime":34372,"topicId":34371,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My son doesn t read books on his own and I ve been pondering this.

I&#39;m just wondering if <br/>\nanyone else&#39;s kids have had a similar pattern and what has happened in the long run.  I <br/>\nhave no attachment to whether he reads books or not, except that it&#39;s something that <br/>\nbrings so much enjoyment to my life--I don&#39;t judge books as inherently better than other <br/>\nmedia, for example, just another option amongst many--but an option consistently not <br/>\nchosen, so I&#39;m just curiously pondering that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs background, DS (almost 13) began homeschooling at 7.5.  We were very loose and <br/>\nexploring unschooling, and then really went with it by the time he was about 9.  Sometime <br/>\naround there he took off with independent reading and blazed through 2 or 3 series like <br/>\nThe Magic Treehouse books.  Then he read all of the Harry Potter books straight through.  <br/>\nThat was by about 10.  He hasn&#39;t really picked up a book for pleasure since then.  He gave <br/>\na few a try after HP but nothing compared for him, so he lost interest.  He, of course, <br/>\nreads all the time for information.  I have no &quot;concerns&quot; about reading--it&#39;s just more of a <br/>\ncuriosity about the lack of interest in all the fantastic stories that are out there--it seems <br/>\nlike there is just a profusion of good stories that fall in line with many of his interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was a kid I read all the time.  My mother would let me stay home from school to <br/>\nfinish books because I&#39;d become so wrapped up--I still do, and read all the time.  But <br/>\nbooks are what we had.  So what I&#39;m wondering is has other media filled that need?  There <br/>\nare such great stories available now in movies and t.v.--we&#39;ve started renting the seasons <br/>\nof good tv series that we hadn&#39;t seen before.  He&#39;s loving MacGuyver!  And I love t.v.--we <br/>\nall do--and movies, and...  I&#39;ve been thinking lately about how people just love stories, <br/>\nand t.v./movies gives stories life in a different way than books.  They are all different, <br/>\nthough. Watching t.v. and movies doesn&#39;t make me any less interested in a good book, <br/>\nbecause the experience is different.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I just wanted to toss this out there and see if others had anything to say.  Thank <br/>\nyou, Joanna</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34369,"nextTopicId":34378}}
