I was <br/>\ntelling Seamus the entire plot (condensed!)of &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; <br/>\nwhich i was reading at the time, and we were comparing it to the <br/>\nMerlin stories we&#39;d read*****<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Its amazing the similar experiences we have had too,  as far as Mists of Avalon and others seeing how much the kids are learning from unschooling.  Not to mention the relationships we have with each other. :D  Which has flourished since unschooling.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  On Christmas Eve we had a fondue with my in-laws and our neighbor.  Our neighbor is a college professor who seems really cool but I hadn&#39;t really gotten into particulars with him on our &quot;schooling&quot; or not &quot;schooling&quot; :D<br/>\n   <br/>\n  You should have heard our conversations that evening,    I really wish I could have a tape recording of it all, its hard to recall, but it was kind of like this.<br/>\n   <br/>\nSome of the connections that occurred-- Japanese history from Alec (ds12)who loved Last Samurai and has since watched Shogun talking with my neighbor who lived in Japan for a few years. My neighbor had actually seen Blackthorn&#39;s grave. (Character from Shogun)  That led to comparing the historic fact vs fiction in the different movies/books.  Linking that to history of artillery/weaponry from war talk of Last Samurai and Call of Duty/Halo.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  As far as Mysts of Avalon, we got on that from our new experiences of playing World of Warcraft and my daughter,Abbi(11) and I are druids and our neighbor was fascinated with her knowledge of that.  That lead to the King Arthur movie, and First Knight and Merlin talk.  He is now wanting to get us a DVD set about druids/castles and progression of different cities, that David McCullough(sp?) did for PBS, I guess its really cool.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Wow.   It was great and Grandpa sat there with his head just nodding,  seeing it all.  Connections.

At least from grandma. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>\n<br/>\n****For years we&#39;ve just told the kids &quot;Grandma is just like that; ignore  <br/>\nher.&quot;   Sometimes there&#39;s more detail, like that she grew up  <br/>\ndifferently, and she controlled her own kids (tried to) a lot more  <br/>\nthan we do, and other analytical touches, but mostly it&#39;s &quot;That&#39;s how  <br/>\nshe is.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra*****<br/>\n<br/>\n  We tried that too. Explaining to the kids (and ourselves) those elements of grandma&#39;s life that seem to have made her what she is. How she grew up, where and when, who her parents were... <br/>\n   <br/>\n  The other day Darin and I were watching one of our favorite Christmas movies, A Christmas Story, and Jack was with us. A scene: the narrator says something like &#39;My kid brother hadn&#39;t eaten voluntarily in over three years&#39; and then you hear the mom say &#39;Eat! There are starving children in China.&#39; and the little brother reluctantly slops this huge overflowing spoonful of oatmeal into his mouth as he whines. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Jack looks at Darin who is laughing and then at me and says &#39;I don&#39;t get it. If he doesn&#39;t want to eat, why is she making him? And what do kids in China have to do with it? Its not like if he doesn&#39;t eat it his mom can give the leftovers to China.&#39; And Darin said, &#39;its just a movie Jack.&#39; and I said, &#39;but he&#39;s right.&#39; And went on to explain that was a standard tow-the-line response parents gave kids of that era. How it is a &#39;sin&#39; to waste food, and that Jack might even, in today&#39;s world run into people who might say something along those lines to him or his friends. To which Jack said, &#39;if it is a sin to waste food, and the mom knows he doesn&#39;t like that food, then isn&#39;t it her sin for fixing it and serving it when she knows he won&#39;t eat it? Why doesn&#39;t she either fix something he likes, let him fix something, or let him eat when he wants to?&#39; By that time Darin had paused the movie and was grinning at me over Jack&#39;s head. He asked Jack when he had gotten so analytical, and Jack<br/>\n said, &#39;I don&#39;t know what that means Dad, but I know whats right and whats wrong.&#39; <br/>\n   <br/>\n  You know, sometimes I worry that I haven&#39;t done a good enough job of breaking the cycle of children should be seen and not heard, and even the abuses both Darin and I had to deal with growing up. I worry that even though I don&#39;t *think* I listen to those critical voices, that there may still be areas in my life that reflect through my words and actions, what those voices may be saying should or shouldn&#39;t be done. (Does that even make sense? I hope so.) But then one of the kids will say or do something like this, and I know that in one area, at least, I&#39;ve managed to do a little something right. <br/>\n  ~Nancy<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: filtering our kids/ voices in our heads","postDate":"1135683627","msgId":23562,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ2NjZBOUIxLTkyQTAtNEY1Qy04ODlFLThENjZENUYyNzdEQUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUxMjI3MDU0MTU0LjQyMjAyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjgxMTAxLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDUxMjI3MDU0MTU0LjQyMjAyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjgxMTAxLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":23560,"nextInTopic":23566,"prevInTime":23561,"nextInTime":23563,"topicId":23538,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Mine was that the kids made the choice of what to eat.

The waitress&#39; view of *isn&#39;t that great* and my MIL&#39;s view that it wasn&#39;t good enough. And how easy it was for me, then, to be sucked into that mentality. To find myself questioning my own decisions. Maybe what I was doing wasn&#39;t good enough, because what the kids had done wasn&#39;t good enough. But now I realize that for her (my MIL), it won&#39;t ever matter. The kids could fix themselves a wholesome plate of veges, a small amount of low in fat meat, a glass of milk, whatever, and then choose a bowl of ice cream or a handful of cookies and the rest wouldn&#39;t count.

There will always be people like<br/>\n that in our lives. But for me, and for my kids, I&#39;ve made a very conscious decision to not hear that.

We talked a little bit <br/>\nabout how writers sometimes use a thing called a thesaurus (and <br/>\nlater showed him the one we have at home), how instead of <br/>\nwriting &quot;Kronok walked...&quot; a million times he could say &quot;he trekked&quot; <br/>\nor &quot;he travelled&quot; or whatever. That got seamus really thinking about <br/>\nembellishing the story, really describing everything.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe also plays an online game called &quot;Second Life&quot; (basically a sims-<br/>\nlike world), he created a sign for his casino that was supposedly <br/>\nwritten by Kronok....he said he wanted it to sound old fashioned, <br/>\nfrom another time, so he used &quot;Ye&quot; and &quot;-eth&quot; alot. He can also <br/>\ncreate weapons, like a staff, or swords....later he wanted to show <br/>\nme what he had made, but we were at home and our computer lives at <br/>\nmy mom&#39;s house. So he found a paper and some colored pencils and <br/>\ndrew them for me. Even though we have plenty of art supplies around, <br/>\nlots of &quot;Learn to draw&quot; books, he hasnt really shown an interest in <br/>\nabout a year (liked to draw alot before that)....but because of this <br/>\ncomputer game, he was drawing. <br/>\n<br/>\nQuite honestly, i am not sure our unschooling journey would be <br/>\nprogressing like it is if it *werent* for videogames and computer <br/>\n(online)games.

A few years back, Darin&#39;s mom had taken the kids and I out to lunch at the GC. I like going to buffet type places not because of the food, but because it affords the kids more choices than say a typical meal at home. They get to assert more independence in their choices and it shows me that they can and do make good choices. I don&#39;t worry so much anymore about that sort of thing, but when they were younger and we were just starting unschooling, it was a good reinforcement tool for ME. Anyway, we were there with Darin&#39;s mom, and both kids had broccoli on their plates. The server noticed it was not only on their plates, but that they were eating it with pleasure. So she made a comment about kids and vegetables and so forth and was it their choice and they liked it or did they have<br/>\n to eat it, kind of statement. Before I had a chance to smile and say they eat it because they like it. My MIL scowled and said,  &#39;But it has cheese on it.&#39;  WHAT??? Who cares! But she cares. The cheese negated the broccoli, made it mere junk food in her eyes. Another time she came over and the kids and I were making pizza. We had spent the morning picking vegetables from our little garden and part of the afternoon at a local cheese store, walking around having samples, asking questions about the this and that of cheese and the making of cheese. So we came away with fresh mozzarella, Havarti, piezella, and some others with plans to make a wonderful pizza for dinner that night. But to my MIL it was pizza. A junk food. It didn&#39;t matter that the crust was homemade, kneaded with love. &lt;g&gt; Or that the veges were fresh from that morning or the cheese not processed and packaged, but fresh and full of good things. It didn&#39;t matter that the kids were enjoying being in the kitchen with a mom<br/>\n who mostly claims that area of the house as hers and hers alone. Junk Junk Junk. Pizza=Junk, Broccoli with cheese=Junk. For some, if it doesn&#39;t hurt it isn&#39;t good for you. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Now that we don&#39;t have contact with her it is easier. But when we did spend time with her it took time, afterward, to deprogram. Not so much the kids, but me, and Darin too. To get that critical voice and look out of our heads. To not second guess things like school, food choices, TV/video game/computer times. To be able to not care about strangers looks. To not hear our mothers/in-laws/grandparents voices in our heads. I believe it does get easier to filter those voices out of my head. It will get easier for you too. <br/>\n  ~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\nmultimomma &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:autismhelp@...\">autismhelp@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n    I&#39;m really glad you said that.

She an  <br/>\nengineer and writes more logically and in less relationship/emotion  <br/>\nbased ways than other unschooling writers.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/\">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I do, however, think you have missed the point -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think I missed the point.  You want to use me in a personal  <br/>\nstruggle that is already so out of hand that you couldn&#39;t stay  <br/>\ntogether for the sake of a boy who is now bereft of an intact family  <br/>\nand has a father who insults him and his mother when he might be  <br/>\ncomforted in the moment by a simple candy bar.  I think you&#39;re  <br/>\nmissing the point, not I.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he had as much attention, love and positive regard as you could  <br/>\npour out on him, a candy bar would be a small blip on a distant  <br/>\nhorizon, but you choose instead to treat him as a faulty creature who  <br/>\nneeds Sylvan cram-school before he is worthy of acceptance.<br/>\n<br/>\nIF you would actually go to those webpages I voluntarily sent you  <br/>\n(which I also voluntarily created and make available, and pay for the  <br/>\nwebspace to keep them on)� if you had read them thoughtfully and with  <br/>\na sincere desire to learn, you might be changing now instead of  <br/>\ncontinuing to recite to yourself that it&#39;s not your fault, your ex  <br/>\nwife is wrong, you are right, she&#39;s ruining your child, the children  <br/>\nyou have with you aren&#39;t that way, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Again, I am asking for objective advice.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI think by &quot;objective&quot; you mean &quot;in my favor.&quot;  You aren&#39;t the  <br/>\nwounded party here, your son is.  He is needy.  He is lacking.  If he  <br/>\nis damaged, it&#39;s by you too, and so start to repair that damage  <br/>\ninstead of making it worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have the urge to write to me again, go to Joyce&#39;s page and  <br/>\nread, read, read instead.  Make your son the star of his own life.   <br/>\nFind what he is good at and take your spotlight off what he&#39;s not  <br/>\ngood at yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are unfamiliar with Abraham Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs, DO  <br/>\nread that for sure.  Sylvan Learning won&#39;t tell you about it, they  <br/>\nwill just keep taking your money.  For free, you can learn more.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow&#39;s_hierarchy_of_needs\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow&#39;s_hierarchy_of_needs</a><br/>\nLearning doesn&#39;t happen in a child whose physical needs aren&#39;t being  <br/>\nmet, and whose needs for love and belonging aren&#39;t met.  That&#39;s not  <br/>\nme talking, that&#39;s Abraham Maslow, who is studied by every educator  <br/>\nand whose basic ideas would help you in this situation and all others  <br/>\nfor the rest of your life.  It&#39;s just good stuff to know.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoing a little better in every decision you make, in your actions and  <br/>\nyour words and your thoughts, could lead to doing a little better  <br/>\neach subsequent time. If you dig in your heels and insist to yourself  <br/>\nthat  you don&#39;t need to change any of your behavior or thinking,  <br/>\nnothing and no one will be able to help your situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck, Merry Christmas, and read at Joyce&#39;s page.<br/>\n   If you finish Joyce&#39;s page, please go back and read the pages I  <br/>\nsuggested in the earlier e-mail, and don&#39;t read them for how you can  <br/>\nfind your ex wife wrong, but how you can make the relationship  <br/>\nbetween you and your son better.  If you don&#39;t do it soon, it will be  <br/>\ntoo late.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>\n------------<br/>\n<br/>\n(P.S.
