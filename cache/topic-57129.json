There are things that are totally fine in my house but not someone else&#39;s or in public - and beyond that things that will draw the wrong kind of attention in public which *I* might be okay with under certain circumstances, but may make a friend uncomfortable. Swearing comes to mind as an example - if a friend of mine told Mo not to swear in public I wouldn&#39;t say &quot;its okay with me&quot; although I would talk about that with Mo at some point. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I never dispute what she says to keep her friendship but that feels like lying to myself ya know? <br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it really feels like lying, then maybe that&#39;s not a friendship worth holding on to. If you can step past the idea of lying, though, to accepting that you can&#39;t change her or her opinions and its not going to help anything to try, then the relationship might work better. Can you agree to avoid talking about religion?<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 9, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Dealing with mismatched beliefs  (was Re: [AlwaysLearning] Hello Sandra","postDate":"1283484002","msgId":57130,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVCRjA3ODlFLTNBMTItNEMzQi1CMzlCLTc4Q0JFQzdCRjAxMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGk1cG1jbStqNjAyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGk1cG1jbStqNjAyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57129,"nextInTopic":57133,"prevInTime":57129,"nextInTime":57131,"topicId":57129,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Like,the wine Jesus and others drank wasn t fermented and achohol drinking is a sin.
