A couple generations ago Kindergarten was preschool Because most kids aren&#39;t ready to start reading before age 7. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it helps people to be reminded of the fact that &quot;early education&quot; is a new thing - something started to help disadvantaged kids who didn&#39;t have the same sorts of resources at home - like books! But then two other phenomena pushed early education into the mainstream: working moms, and the gifted/superbaby concept. On the one hand, people want to think they can make their kids better and smarter and on the other people will accept free public Education where they&#39;ll rally against free public Daycare. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;it spooks people in the UK to see kids NOT appearing to be taught<br/>\n </span></blockquote>from the age of 4.

One of the reasons &quot;unschooling&quot; young children has become such a popular concept in some circles is that the fight to get kids into &quot;the best preschool&quot; starts when kids are 3... in some places younger as parents prep kids for preschool entrance interviews. But even some of those &quot;unschooling&quot; families are doing it in hopes it will make their kids better and smarter, so they can get into a better Kindergarten. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;The teaching is not learning thing is important to explain to the OP&#39;s parents<br/>\n </span></blockquote>too. <br/>\n************<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a certain irony to trying to teach someone that teaching isn&#39;t learning ;) <br/>\n<br/>\nI found it helped to step back from the idea that I was going to teach my extended family about home education and unschooling and instead look for ways to reassure them that the grandbabies were Fine - bright and interested in the world, and learning lots, and nevermind how that happened.

There&#39;s a reason first grade doesn&#39;t start until age 6 or 7 - it used to be unheard of for kids to even start learning to read before then. <br/>\n<br/>\n Even by the most optimistic modern school standards 5yos are expected to be able to recognize a handful of common words (like Walmart and maybe their own name, but only in one style of handwriting) and are just beginning to learn to &quot;sound out&quot; simple, familiar, single syllable words. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a basic summary of school expectations:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://kidshealth.org/parent/positive/all_reading/milestones.html#\">http://kidshealth.org/parent/positive/all_reading/milestones.html#</a><br/>\n<br/>\nand a longer description of school goals for reading in the primary grades:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://readingprograms.org/our-approach/stages-of-reading-development/\">http://readingprograms.org/our-approach/stages-of-reading-development/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNote that kids aren&#39;t expected to starting learning to read independently until 2nd grade (7-8) despite two years of education, and aren&#39;t expected to read with enough comprehension for it to really matter (that&#39;s what they mean by absorption) until 3rd or 4th grade (8-10). <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a wholly different set of expectations than natural learning. Two good books on the subject of how reading is learned naturally are: Much More than the ABCs by Judith Schickendanz and Literacy Through Play by Gretchen Owocki. Both are about kids learning to read in open classrooms - university lab schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I wouldn&#39;t necessarily pass any of that along to your parents if they&#39;re worried that a 4yo isn&#39;t reading. It might be better to say something like &quot;according to my research they&#39;re not behind at all, but thanks for your concern, we&#39;re definitely working on it and I&#39;m happy with their progress&quot; and then tell some cute story about how wonderful their grandkids are. <br/>\n<br/>\nGrandparents, friends and extended family ask about school and homeschool because they don&#39;t have any other context for talking about kids any more. On top of that, it&#39;s become normal for parents to complain about the dramas of school - who&#39;s behind, who&#39;s in trouble, why this year&#39;s teacher isn&#39;t as good as last years... so when mom is the teacher, grandparents (etc) are left floundering a little. They don&#39;t know what to say or ask and so with all the best intentions they get it totally wrong and put their feet in their mouths.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to rescue them from their own gaucherie, feed them stories of what the kids enjoy, what they&#39;re doing, what they&#39;re excited about, so they can have some context and feel like they&#39;re connected with their beloved grandchildren without having to ask about school. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":504505579,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Grandparents concerned about young kids not reading yet","postDate":"1369592309","msgId":71529,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBT09UYVhPVHBOOUxiZUNIR3RGZjl0RGZYTDYtM01hREZzSlNMM2dTYlBUWHhZKzg4QUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGtudGZlOCtlOTVlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtudGZlOCtlOTVlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71528,"nextInTopic":71530,"prevInTime":71528,"nextInTime":71530,"topicId":71528,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

What if you have kids who read at 10 or<br/>\n11? It isn&#39;t uncommon for unschooled kids to learn at very different ages<br/>\nthan schooled kids. If you start out trying to document their learning,<br/>\nwhat are you going to say when they are 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 and still not<br/>\nreading? It happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, maybe point out that their expectations are not realistic. Kids IN<br/>\nschool don&#39;t read at 4 or 5. At 4 and 5 kids are typically just barely<br/>\nlearning to hear rhyming words and maybe recognize a few street signs and<br/>\npretend they are reading the words on them. If they lean that direction,<br/>\nthey will be showing interest in letters and numbers and might want to copy<br/>\nor trace their names or other words.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is typical - but there are kids who are fluently reading at that age<br/>\nand kids who have no interest in anything to DO with letters and sounds<br/>\nyet.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometime around 6 or 7 kids typically get interested in decoding - meaning<br/>\nthey start to get the idea that letters represent sounds and they start<br/>\n&quot;sounding out&quot; words.<br/>\nAgain - that&#39;s typically around 6 or 7 years old but MANY kids, even kids<br/>\nin school, aren&#39;t doing it at those ages.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus - there are some kids who don&#39;t learn to read by learning to decode<br/>\nfirst. Instead, they seem to memorize (without letter-sound connection) a<br/>\nvery very large number of words and can recognize (read) those words before<br/>\nthey grasp that &quot;sounding out&quot; is even a possibility. You may have a kid<br/>\nlike this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just don&#39;t know if it is a great idea to feel so obligated to write down<br/>\nso much detailed documentation of their learning - it might be setting a<br/>\nprecedent that will backfire.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":330565882,"authorName":"LydiaK","from":"&quot;LydiaK&quot; &lt;princessjasmine05@...&gt;","profile":"lidjalynne05","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Grandparents concerned about young kids not reading yet","postDate":"1369587976","msgId":71528,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtudGZlOCtlOTVlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":71529,"prevInTime":71527,"nextInTime":71529,"topicId":71528,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My parents have expressed concern that my four and five year olds can t read yet, particularly sight words.
