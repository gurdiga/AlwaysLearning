The Computer was left &#39;lying around&#39; and from there the children were able to discover what they wanted to do with it. The children were also looked in on, to see how they were going, but without any expected outcomes being looked for.<br/>\ncheers<br/>\nTrude</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50387,"nextTopicId":50440}}
