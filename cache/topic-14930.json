Neither of my boys is into sports.  They do like <br/>\ncomputer and video games but also are into medieval times, knights and <br/>\ncastles etc,  anything to do with nature, animals, gardening, lizards (we have a <br/>\nfair number of pets), robots, dinosaurs, Ancient Egypt, space, mythology ... at <br/>\nleast right now those are some of their interests.  It can and probably will <br/>\nchange tomorrow.  They can and do hold conversations with adults.  That is part <br/>\nof their world.  They go with me grocery shopping, to the post office etc.  <br/>\nYou may not have contact with many unschoolers in your area.  I know there are <br/>\nonly 2 other families in my area and I only met them recently.  Before that I <br/>\nwas a loner around here and thought of as the &quot;alien.&quot;  LOL.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway your exposure may be limited so I do encourage you to attend the <br/>\nconference if you can.

LOL. I guess the<br/>\narticles and books I have read is what got me<br/>\ninterested.  And this email list!  In theory<br/>\nunschooling sounds wonderful!  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut please don&#39;t throw tomatoes...I just haven&#39;t been<br/>\naround kids who come from families who say they<br/>\nunschool who are like the ones described on this list<br/>\nand in the articles and books.  I know people aren&#39;t<br/>\nmaking up stories, but I guess I was sharing my<br/>\nfear...that if I go all the way with unschooling that<br/>\nmaybe my kids won&#39;t have depth and breadth either. The<br/>\nunschooling kids I have met don&#39;t have depth and<br/>\nbreadth. The kids seem real physical and end up in<br/>\nfights and stuff.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was excited to hear about a conference in Columbia<br/>\nso I can see more variety of unschoolers.  Maybe I am<br/>\nmeeting a lot of non-schoolers?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might roll your eyes when I tell you this...but<br/>\nthe kids who do seem to have extraordinary depth and<br/>\nbreadth are kids who are Christian classical education<br/>\nhomeschoolers.  I don&#39;t know a word of Latin, and<br/>\ntheology is a TOTAL bore to me, so the method and<br/>\ncurriculum doesn&#39;t attract me at all. Not at all!! But<br/>\nthe kids all seem very well-read, have good social<br/>\nskills, and good academic skills in general. They seem<br/>\nto have developed real interests beyond video games<br/>\nand sports.  I have nothing in common with the moms,<br/>\nso I could never join their support group. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I guess I have been wanting to discuss this<br/>\nbecause I have been confused...and it wasn&#39;t my<br/>\nintention to insult anyone&#39;s method of homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for writing,<br/>\nRachel Minninger<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
