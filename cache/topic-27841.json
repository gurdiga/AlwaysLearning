My boys were warned years ago that  <br/>\nsome girls would rather be pregnant than not.  Some girls would  <br/>\nwelcome a reason to make their parents angry, or to move away (or get  <br/>\nthrown out).<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s matter of fact.  I knew girls like that grown up, I&#39;ve read  <br/>\nwhat some teenaged moms said about their feelings surrounding their  <br/>\nfirst pregnancy.  I have a cousin who had four children by the time  <br/>\nshe was 21, by four different fathers.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my husband&#39;s ex girlfriends told me once that her earliest  <br/>\nmemory was of lying on  her back in a treehouse, looking at the  <br/>\ntrees, and the other boys taking turns on her.  It wasn&#39;t a horrible  <br/>\nmemory for her, just a matter-of-fact memory.  Her ex husband just  <br/>\nfound out in the past few months that his oldest daughter was not his  <br/>\nbiological daughter.  This came up when she needed a blood transfusion.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo pretend such situations aren&#39;t all around us isn&#39;t good or  <br/>\nhealthy.  To focus on them and make the whole world about them is  <br/>\nequally as unhealthy.  Being realistic about dangerous situation, and  <br/>\nbeing cautious but not reactionary, is the best we can do for our  <br/>\nchildren.  They will be out in a world with those things all around  <br/>\nthem, and they need to know enough to protect themselves from abuse  <br/>\nor entanglement while still knowing they can be friends with such  <br/>\npeople and have relationships with them that don&#39;t involve sexuality.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am NOT fishing for responses or confessions here, but there are  <br/>\npeople who will read this who were abused as children, or raped, or  <br/>\nwho have had abortions, or given a secret baby up for adoption under  <br/>\nduress and pressure and live with a deep sorrow.  There are people  <br/>\nhere who might be married to people who were sexually abused in small  <br/>\nor large ways, and that might affect their sexual behavior and  <br/>\nattitude even if they don&#39;t have clear memories of what happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone&#39;s experience is different, and secrecy and covering and  <br/>\nignoring can be partly healthy and partly UNhealthy.  We should not  <br/>\ntell children everything we know and we shouldn&#39;t refuse to tell them  <br/>\nanything at all.

It seems<br/>\ninappropriate to me and I&#39;m not sure if I am just conjuring up<br/>\nfeelings from my childhood or if this is a legitimate concern.  I&#39;d<br/>\nrather face the emotions I&#39;m having now even though this might never<br/>\nhappen.  Sorscha is not sexual at all.  She does not think anything of<br/>\nboys or girls as other than friends.  She has never said, &quot;Hey so and<br/>\nso&#39;s hot.&quot;  As she is getting older, more and more boys are falling<br/>\nfor her and she is completely oblivious.  Currently there are four<br/>\nboys who are enamored with my booger faced, rats-nest hair, up until<br/>\nThursday food filled braces daughter.  Heehee. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sorscha and I are very open with our &#39;sex talk&#39;.

I told her she had every right to decide whom she wanted<br/>\nto kiss her or not.  Therefore, I think that if a situation like this<br/>\ncame about that I have complete faith in her to make a reasonable<br/>\ndecision for her self.  But then I&#39;m having those mommy feelings that<br/>\na child that much older and who is &#39;highly sexual&#39; would be taking<br/>\nadvantage of a smaller child.  Then I had another very traditional<br/>\nparenting friend say to me, &quot;Well, if she has complete freedom over<br/>\nher own body, are you okay if she wanted to have sex?&quot;  Sooo, this<br/>\nwhole situation has sparked a beautiful avalanche of thoughts in my<br/>\nhead.  I do not want to project any of my &#39;junk&#39; onto Sorscha so I<br/>\nthink that it is great that this situation came up because it has<br/>\nreally got me thinking and hopefully I can organize my thoughts and<br/>\nfeelings for the &#39;maybe&#39; or &#39;maybe not&#39; future. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Looking forward to your ponderings based on being RUers.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Seriously need to go play! <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ~Crystal~<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; PS: And yes Diana...I&#39;ll be at your talk.

Since many of us wont<br/>\nget to the Fireside Chat, what with living in far away places and<br/>\nsuch, I thought I&#39;d mention a few things round this topic as it has<br/>\nbeen and is talked about in our house. I&#39;m happy to be critiqued and<br/>\nopen to be told &quot;too much for the list!&quot; as well, though I don&#39;t<br/>\nbelieve what I say will be in that territory. Depending on the<br/>\nindividual levels of comfort readers here have around sex(uality) and<br/>\nlearning, I could come off anywhere between a big vanilla prude or in<br/>\nneed of a whole lot of saving. I think I&#39;m pretty middle of the road<br/>\nreally, and I hope, sensible and sensitive about sex and<br/>\nchildren/younger people.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I hope this post doesn&#39;t take days to come through and become<br/>\nredundant because of that, seeing as a lot of yahoo! group mail is<br/>\nlost in space right now... one post I sent a couple of days ago is<br/>\nstill missing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly, Crystal, I think that if someone let me know their child was<br/>\nvery sexual, I think I&#39;d like to know that their child was aware that<br/>\nnot all other children or young people of varying ages are necessarily<br/>\nlikewise. I was trying to think how I would broach the conversation if<br/>\nI&#39;d decided I&#39;d like more information from the parent(s), like the<br/>\nlevel of awareness/knowledge their child had around others&#39; sexuality<br/>\nor lack there of, and around consent. How to set about that<br/>\nconversation if I&#39;d decided it might be wise and possible to have it,<br/>\nwould depend on how well I knew the family and what I knew about the<br/>\nway they relate in their family whether mainstream, RU or whatever. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is possible that a family who seems RU in many ways might not have<br/>\ngone so far as to talk about being respectful of the bodily autonomy<br/>\nof other children when it comes to sexual things. They might not do<br/>\nthat for numbers of reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo I can think of are: not thinking further than &quot;all children<br/>\nplay/experiment some&quot; or, with the intention of not shaming their own<br/>\nchild, because they don&#39;t know how or aren&#39;t comfortable talking about<br/>\nconsent in matter of fact ways, even around the games that children<br/>\nmight play that seem low key, like truth or dare, for instance.  Even<br/>\nthat can have elements of coercion, I would think, just because it is<br/>\nwhat it is. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn discussing this with another parent, especially one who&#39;d let me<br/>\nknow their child was very sexual, I&#39;d do my best to reassure them that<br/>\nI had no intention to shame them or their child, only to be matter of<br/>\nfact (with the probably unspoken goal of ascertaining that my child<br/>\nwould be safe, or finding out what my child might need to know in<br/>\norder to be/feel/remain safe).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, I decide long ago that I would like for my own child to<br/>\nbe as clued up as it is possible and comfortable for her to be, so<br/>\nthat she not only knows herself (and what all else there is) well but<br/>\nis able to also be respectful of others. I&#39;ve been open and<br/>\ninformative in the ways it is possible to be gradually through the<br/>\nyears. Talking about different aspects of sex and sexuality as they<br/>\ncame/come up, often presented on our television screen. In fact,<br/>\neverthing I talk about from this point all is about sex in the media,<br/>\nso I do want to say that conversations and information giving and<br/>\nrequesting have happened in other ways - just so as people will know<br/>\nfor sure that my child&#39;s sex ed hasn&#39;t all happened via tv and movies.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, watching Four Weddings and a Funeral years ago with K,<br/>\nwhen the scene where Hugh Grant&#39;s character ends up hiding in a<br/>\ncupboard while a newly wed bride and groom are... going at it like<br/>\nbunnies... it&#39;s just plain bonking (euphamisms can be fun and<br/>\ninteresting to talk about too sometimes), I said what popped into my<br/>\nhead, which was something like, that sex doesn&#39;t always, or even ever<br/>\nhave to look like that. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;ve been multitudes of images of sex we&#39;ve seen together.<br/>\nEverthing from Marge and Homer Simpson rockin&#39; the casbah, through<br/>\nCSI&#39;s furries and all sorts in between and far out, with explanations<br/>\ngiven by me when asked, and sometimes also proferred unasked in a<br/>\nconversational way that is comfortable to us. That mutual level of<br/>\ncomfort grows from the little beginnings. <br/>\n<br/>\nK, now 13 and not yet sexually active, has a clearly defined sense of<br/>\nwhat is sex she can comfortably watch and what is sex she will turn<br/>\nher head from. The latter is mostly where it looks a little or a lot<br/>\nlike something you see on one of the Crime shows (which she chooses<br/>\nnot to watch any longer, having checked them out to her satisfaction),<br/>\nwhere  usually plastic looking people are clearly performing and often<br/>\nkind of violently.  <br/>\n<br/>\nImages she will comfortably watch, are those that look like real<br/>\npeople in real relationships that don&#39;t have that patina, that<br/>\n&quot;glamour&quot; of  performance being wrought (when the actual<br/>\npeople/characters most often seem on some level dissociated from what<br/>\nthey&#39;re doing), nor an overlay of scariness nevermind downright danger<br/>\nand violation. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that&#39;s a pretty healthy place for her to be at right now. <br/>\n<br/>\nParody, of the bodice or pant ripping variety, whether overt like in<br/>\nan old movie called Yellowbeard the Pirate (rip-roaring, UK, Pythonish<br/>\ncast), or less obvious like in American Beauty (the mother as realtor<br/>\nin one scene in a home she&#39;s trying to sell, which K read as parody)<br/>\ndo not make her uncomfortable, because that&#39;s all just downright funny<br/>\nto her.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJo R</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Sex, Age, and Mama&#39;s Feelings","postDate":"1169937956","msgId":27842,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI1MjVCNDdBLTRGOEEtNDk2OC1BMUNFLTczOUI4RDdBNjE3RUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNWEwMWM3NDI0ZCRiM2ZmNWE4MCQwYjAwYThjMEBib3Jnbm9kZT4=","referencesHeader":"PDExNjk3MTMyNTguNDI5LjEwMTkzLm0xOUB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDwwMDVhMDFjNzQyNGQkYjNmZjVhODAkMGIwMGE4YzBAYm9yZ25vZGU+"},"prevInTopic":27841,"nextInTopic":27845,"prevInTime":27841,"nextInTime":27843,"topicId":27841,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Then I had another very traditional parenting friend say to me, Well, if she has complete freedom over her own body, are you okay if she wanted to have","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1910530957\">-=-Then I had another very traditional parenting friend say to me,  <br/>\n&quot;Well, if she has complete freedom over her own body, are you okay if  <br/>\nshe wanted to have sex?&quot;-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI just despise those snarky question.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;So if it&#39;s okay for your child to have a Twinkie, is it okay for him  <br/>\nto shoot heroin?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nUh...

I&#39;d rather face the emotions I&#39;m having now even though this might never happen.  Sorscha is not sexual at all.  She does not think anything of boys or girls as other than friends.  She has never said, &quot;Hey so and so&#39;s hot.&quot;  As she is getting older, more and more boys are falling for her and she is completely oblivious.  Currently there are four boys who are enamored with my booger faced, rats-nest hair, up until Thursday food filled braces daughter.  Heehee. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSorscha and I are very open with our &#39;sex talk&#39;.  In fact, she told me the other day that she did not want me to kiss her without her permission.  I told her she had every right to decide whom she wanted to kiss her or not.  Therefore, I think that if a situation like this came about that I have complete faith in her to make a reasonable decision for her self.  But then I&#39;m having those mommy feelings that a child that much older and who is &#39;highly sexual&#39; would be taking advantage of a smaller child.  Then I had another very traditional parenting friend say to me, &quot;Well, if she has complete freedom over her own body, are you okay if she wanted to have sex?&quot;  Sooo, this whole situation has sparked a beautiful avalanche of thoughts in my head.  I do not want to project any of my &#39;junk&#39; onto Sorscha so I think that it is great that this situation came up because it has really got me thinking and hopefully I can organize my thoughts and feelings for the &#39;maybe&#39; or &#39;maybe not&#39; future. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nLooking forward to your ponderings based on being RUers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously need to go play! <br/>\n<br/>\n~Crystal~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: And yes Diana...I&#39;ll be at your talk.  I did not realize I had any issue with this until now.  Guess I&#39;m always learning. Heehee. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27824,"nextTopicId":27862}}
