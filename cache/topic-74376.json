List discussion focuses on what helps and hinders learning and relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone who posts -- whether a question or a reply -- should want to see their ideas analyzed under an unschooling light.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe list thrives on unschooling questions and discussion! :-) But it&#39;s also perfectly okay to sit back and follow the discussion. (All new members are encouraged to do just that for awhile to get a feel for the list.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMany find the analysis helps them clear out hidden baggage, think more clearly and become the radical unschooling parents they want to be. Some find it uncomfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Always Learning sounds like a list you&#39;d like to try, then Welcome! If not, best wishes in your unschooling and finding a list that fits your unschooling needs.<br/>\n=====<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74363,"nextTopicId":74254}}
