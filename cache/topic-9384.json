Made my own sauce by making a rue<br/>\nfirst... It was looking delicious.  Just finished making a crown for<br/>\nZak.  I got to be a prince and DH a princess (go figure) by wearing<br/>\nTupperware on our heads, holding sticks as our swords.  What a picture<br/>\nperfect day.... When I was making my cauliflower cheese I couldn&#39;t<br/>\nfigure out why the rue was bubbling up so much.  DH and I kept tasting<br/>\nin and it was sort of salty... Persevered and put the sauce on the<br/>\ncarefully cooked cauliflower and popped it into the oven at 350 for 15<br/>\nmins.  Opened the oven to find the sauce covering the entire oven...<br/>\nWhat&#39;s the problem?  DH took it out of the oven (still wearing our<br/>\nTupperware knight helmets) and we tasted it.  It was so salty and not<br/>\npossible to eat.  I then said to DH &quot;I don&#39;t understand this... I used<br/>\nflour like I usually do&quot;... he suddenly had a thought he said &quot;early Max<br/>\nwas climbing up on a chair and getting into that cabinet, I bet he<br/>\ntipped all the baking soda into the flour bag&quot;.... Sure enough the<br/>\nbaking soda container was empty and when I looked into the flour bag I<br/>\ncould see plenty of baking soda.... This brought about an interesting<br/>\nconversation with the King (Zak) about the differences between<br/>\nsubstances that are white and look the same... We talked about baking<br/>\nsoda, baking powder, flour and other cooking substances and how they are<br/>\ndifferent and what they are doing... So unfortunately the cauliflower<br/>\ncheese went down the sink and turkey sandwiches seem to be lunch<br/>\ntoday...  Zak is now dressed in long pants and long shirt (in 100 degree<br/>\nweather) and instructing us on what you need to do to be the King,<br/>\nprince and knights of his land.....<br/>\n <br/>\nOh the joys of unschooling..... Zak has decided to go grocery shopping<br/>\nwith me later to make sure I buy flour and to look at other cooking<br/>\ningredients....<br/>\n <br/>\nDawn<br/>\nTucson, AZ<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9359,"nextTopicId":9385}}
