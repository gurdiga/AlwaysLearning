I&#39;m a Quaker, and we make decisions by a form of consensus that focuses on people deeply listening to each other (and God, if you believe in that--not all Quakers do) rather than arguing. We don&#39;t move forward until we have gotten to a place of agreement; sometimes this means it takes us a long time to make decisions, or that we can&#39;t act because we can&#39;t find unity. But when we do act, it&#39;s with the support of the whole group, generally, though there is also the option for a person to &quot;stand aside&quot; from a decision if she&#39;s not in unity with it but it becomes clear to her that the rest of the group is in unity. And sometimes people allow a decision to go forward even if they don&#39;t 100% agree with it, if they feel they&#39;ve been really heard in their concerns. This happened in my local meeting over the last couple of years as we decided to stop renting and build our own building. One woman said in so many words that she was comfortable moving forward even though she personally didn&#39;t want to take on the building project, because she felt like we had really listened to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do lose members over really big conflicts--same-sex marriage, for instance. Sometimes people who are really uncomfortable with the direction a meeting is going will just disappear.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut one thing we can&#39;t be accused of is voting, and letting a majority run roughshod over a minority.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember when I first got involved in Quakerism being shocked that anybody could believe there was anything _better_ than democracy--we&#39;ve all learned how radical the notion of majority rule, by the people, was, when America was founded, and I never questioned that. And I don&#39;t know how consensus decision-making scales up from the relatively small groups I&#39;ve seen it work well in. But whenever I read anything about a Sudbury-style school, they seem sort of smug about their democratic process, and I&#39;d be more interested personally in a school that was thinking more critically about governance.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot that I&#39;d be very interested in any school.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu, mom to Eric, 9; Carl, 6; Yehva, 2.5<br/>\ntapeflags.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Sudbury schools, and democracy","postDate":"1276084582","msgId":54773,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwMEQyNDE1LUNGNDktNDJCRC1BMUY4LTRFRjFCNTI3RkI1NUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDRDMEYzMzhGLjcwMzAwMDdAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDRDMEU3NERCLjkwMzA2MDlAeWFob28uY2E+IDw3MjE0NzRDMS1CMURGLTQxOEUtQjYyNy00RTEwNEZCNzlFNDZAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+IDw0QzBGMzM4Ri43MDMwMDA3QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":54764,"nextInTopic":54786,"prevInTime":54772,"nextInTime":54774,"topicId":54724,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I ve wondered, occasionally, how the democratic schools avoid the tyranny of the majority problem.

At least none that I admire are.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling parents discuss and model and work with their kids to know  <br/>\nwhat&#39;s okay *in their family* (or community) and what is not.  <br/>\nSometimes, majority &quot;rules&quot; but not always. Sometimes, the needs of  <br/>\nthe youngest trump everyone else&#39;s, for instance. No one sits around  <br/>\ndiscussing whether the fussy baby needs to nurse *right now* or not  <br/>\nand then decide &quot;no&quot; &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause our family principles of sensitivity to others&#39; feelings and  <br/>\nwhat we believe to be socially and philosophically okay in our  <br/>\ncommunity (and the ongoing discussion of such things), my daughter  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t even consider wearing such a shirt. She&#39;s neither hateful,  <br/>\nnor likely to do that kind of thing for shock value to get noticed. If  <br/>\nfor some reason it even came up, you can be sure we would discuss what  <br/>\nwearing such a shirt would mean. If it got to the point that she  <br/>\ninsisted on wearing it, she wouldn&#39;t be going out of the house in it.  <br/>\nHer freedom to wear that symbol (which *is* a universally-accepted  <br/>\nhate symbol and *is* used for that express purpose) stops when what  <br/>\nshe says by wearing it impacts another person. That&#39;s a principle, not  <br/>\na rule, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot to mention that I still buy all her clothes (which she prefers),  <br/>\nand that shirt isn&#39;t on the list &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line: Sudbury is still a school.
