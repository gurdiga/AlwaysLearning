Honestly, the advice to &quot;work on blah blah blah&quot;  Does still sound pretty schooly. He doesn&#39;t Want to work on skills, he wants to do what he wants to do. And part of that may include getting frustrated and deciding he doesn&#39;t want to do it any more. It&#39;s not working for him. That&#39;s a normal artist&#39;s reaction: this isn&#39;t working for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter loves animation but her drawing ability is... pretty average for her age (11). I could advise her to practice drawing - it&#39;s normal educational advice for someone in her position - but that would be really belittling to her. She doesn&#39;t want to Become and animator, she wants to make an animation. So I make sure she has lots and lots of resources which let her make basic animations with the skills she has right now - slide-show sorts of things with drawings modified from stock images of cartoon characters. <br/>\n<br/>\nHas your son looked at the sorts of things kids his age are doing - via youtube or whatever? I&#39;m thinking talking to adult make-up artists might have been a mistake (I know, I suggested it, too, didn&#39;t I?) because it skewed his standards. He&#39;s not Going to do the same kind of work adults do and looking at what they do may be dragging down his opinion of himself and his skills. It helped Mo a lot to look at other kid videos so she could shift her expectations to what was really possible for someone with her skills. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also know from experience that sometimes artists take breaks from things for months and even years - intentionally or otherwise. Giving up on make-up art now doesn&#39;t necessarily mean he&#39;ll never do it again. He may just need to do something else for awhile - that&#39;s a very natural way of &quot;building new skills&quot; actually. I know several artists who have dropped something only to come back later and find we&#39;ve learned a lot of things that inform our art... all without intending to do so. That&#39;s how learning works in real life, after all. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s a natural perfectionist, then it may be something he&#39;s just going to have to work through, over and over - because he&#39;s going to fall short of his own unrealistic standards over and over. That&#39;s something my partner goes through, and I don&#39;t have any great advice as to how to help... other than it Doesn&#39;t help to say &quot;oh, but your work is really good&quot;. That only brings on a litany of all the flaws he sees!

I think this probably accounts for so much.  Griffin has increasingly been sending messages that he wants to be left alone.  e.g. he watches his laptop or plays video games with a sheet over him.  So it feels like it is getting harder to share what he is doing.  He does invite me to watch certain parts of three stooges movies for example and I&#39;ll share something with him, but I guess generally i&#39;ve gotten in the habit of leaving him alone.  Conversely Quinn (8) is very social with me and wants to talk or play games or go with me quite often.  Quinn is also very good at saying &quot;I need attention now&quot; whereas Griff would never say that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been feeling like I&#39;ve been letting Griffin down lately because I&#39;m out of ideas of things to do at home aside from laptop stuff (watching, searching for things) and video games)  and the occasionally bout of sword fighting or gardening.  As an 11 yo he is not into toys anymore really, but not really into projects that I can help with.  We still play some role playing games but when we all play together he and Quinn usually get in a disagreement about the rules of the game and one will leave because he is no longer enjoying it.<br/>\nMelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":386666394,"authorName":"melgqd","from":"&quot;melgqd&quot; &lt;boisei@...&gt;","profile":"melgqd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Brother unhappy and wants control","postDate":"1372026768","msgId":71665,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtxN3QyZytpZGJpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJMVTE3My1EUzE2ODRFMDQwQ0U5RDM3QjYxNzEyQTRDNDg5MEBwaHguZ2JsPg=="},"prevInTopic":71664,"nextInTopic":71666,"prevInTime":71664,"nextInTime":71666,"topicId":71656,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It&#39;s like he reaches out desperately to control because he doesn&#39;t have the skills to communicate what his true issue is.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the case you describe, have you attempted to help Griffin communicate why he doesn&#39;t want Quinn to view the movie first?  And why he wants to wait until after Chicago?  With my boys, it sometimes helps to get very detailed with the reasons for things.  Why does Quinn want to see the movie before Chicago?  After I have gathered as much detail, I facilitate a discussion between them.  So, Quinn wants to see the movie before because he&#39;s been waiting for months for it to come out and doesn&#39;t want to wait any longer (or whatever his reason is) but Griffin wants to wait until he finishes reading the book... And he&#39;s very worried Quinn will tell him what happens...  Or whatever their reasons are.  And then we have a discussion brainstorming how we can make everyone happy.  Usually the kids can come up with the solutions- and often miraculously they each give a little-- but also it happens sometimes that my easy going 13 year old just decides to let it go his brother&#39;s way.  I think it makes a difference for him to know what his brother&#39;s reasons for the demand happen to be.  And if it sounds reasonable, he&#39;s often okay with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese discussions have also revealed that my younger child can sometimes be rigid for no specific reason that he can explain.  Almost seems like he&#39;s so willful that he is holding on to the fight just because he can&#39;t bear to lose.  It is then that I explain why it is important to some of us to do it another way. I&#39;ll say something like maybe it would help you to hear why it&#39;s important to me to do it this way... And often that helps too- like giving him a pathway that allows him to break the stubbornness- to save face- to allow it to go his brother&#39;s way because mom also has a reason for it to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps,<br/>\nAli<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Brother unhappy and wants control","postDate":"1371993659","msgId":71657,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtxNnNucis3bmo4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGtxNHQ3OStocm03QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71656,"nextInTopic":71658,"prevInTime":71656,"nextInTime":71658,"topicId":71656,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ************** That s probably a big part of why there s a lot of conflict right now - it s hard and stressful to have that feeling of dissatisfaction.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-257427093\">&quot;melgqd&quot; &lt;boisei@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Lately, G. has been generally unhappy and says he feels like he is waiting for something to happen or opportunities to be presented to him but doesn&#39;t know what.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s probably a big part of why there&#39;s a lot of conflict right now - it&#39;s hard and stressful to have that feeling of dissatisfaction.

Get him a cosmetology head if he wants, or let him paint you and dad and any other friend or family member who will sit still long enough. Look up zombie art and cos-play online and find examples of home-made special effects. Go to a comic or movie or anime convention and geek out over the people in costume. Chat up some real life costumers and make-up artists and ask them how they got started - it wasn&#39;t with &quot;building skills&quot; it was with playing around, having fun with ideas, and making messes.

And they&#39;re good places to learn about conventions and other cos-play venues. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":522415608,"authorName":"Carla-Marie Sutton","from":"Carla-Marie Sutton &lt;carlamarie_33@...&gt;","profile":"carlamariesutton","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Brother unhappy and wants control","postDate":"1371989525","msgId":71659,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERVQjExOS1XN0U0MzQwMTg1QzNEMzA1RDgwMUUyOUY4OTBAcGh4LmdibD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGtxNHQ3OStocm03QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtxNHQ3OStocm03QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71658,"nextInTopic":71660,"prevInTime":71658,"nextInTime":71660,"topicId":71656,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I really feel for you as I have a similar older child who often tries to control the younger siblings.

My 8","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-412255051\">Hi all,<br/>\n  This week my two boys (8 and 11) have gone from one fight to the next. They all seem to have a similar pattern.  Here is the latest and biggest.  My 8 yo, Quinn, wants to see a particular movie before an upcoming trip to Chicago.  My older, Griffin, wants to wait and see it after we return.  The point of contention is that Griff does not want Q. to see it before he does.  The pattern I notice is that when G. wants to get his way it very often involves not letting Q. get his or controlling his behavior in some way.  Where as when Q. wants something, it does not involve controlling what G. does. <br/>\n  G. is very upset about the movie plan and is upset that my husband and I don&#39;t just do what he wants.  We are inclined to let each child see the movie when they want but we don&#39;t feel it is right to tell Q. he can&#39;t see it when he wants because his brother doesn&#39;t want that.  G. is now claiming that we like Q. more and &quot;he always wins&quot;.  My husband and I try to get each child what they need but it is hard when the one child wants to control the other.  <br/>\n  Lately, G. has been generally unhappy and says he feels like he is waiting for something to happen or opportunities to be presented to him but doesn&#39;t know what.  He doesn&#39;t like to go out, doesn&#39;t have any friends for playdates (his choice..He was never very social with playdates and such and after he left school (in 3rd) he slowly fell out with his 1 friend).  We have a large family and he sees many of them throughout the week and we are always together.  He does not want to take any class that involves other people.  He has interests in special effects makeup, but feels he doesn&#39;t have the skill to pursue it, and doesn&#39;t want to develop the skills (he knows that basic drawing and sculpting is important for that field but doesn&#39;t want to work on those). This causes him much frustration. He also loves history esp. war time.  We are going to the eastern U.S. for wartime tourist stuff in the fall.  We watch a lot of movies and I try to bring in things he will enjoy but I find it hard to go out to find things to bring in.  My 8yo doesn&#39;t like me to go out without him (even when he can stay with Dad) and he doesn&#39;t really like to go out so I&#39;m feeling a bit limited. <br/>\n  I&#39;m hoping you all can see something that I can&#39;t..<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\nMelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71655,"nextTopicId":71676}}
