My<br/>\nkids, ds 14 & dd 12, have never openly talked about having children in the<br/>\nfuture in quite that way but they have mentioned being parents once or twice<br/>\nover the years so I know they&#39;ve thought about it.  I don&#39;t think it was<br/>\nmuch more than if they might go down that road though.  I know that I&#39;ve<br/>\nsaid to them things like how glad I am that I&#39;ve been able to learn how to<br/>\nbe a different parent than my own parents were.  I know  they&#39;ve noticed for<br/>\nawhile now that other parents do definitely parent much differently and<br/>\nthey&#39;ve said how glad they are we are different than &#39;most&#39; families.<br/>\nBeing nontraditional families the children might start questioning things<br/>\nsooner than others.<br/>\n <br/>\nI remember as a young girl pretending I had a child who I seem to remember<br/>\nscolding alot.  I think an unschool me would pretend very differently.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nrealized, over the years looking back, I was totally afraid of having<br/>\nchildren too.  I always knew I didn&#39;t want the relationship with my own<br/>\nchildren I had with my parents.  Until I knew I could do it differently I<br/>\nwasn&#39;t ready to have children, I was still afraid but had more confidence.  <br/>\n <br/>\nRobyn wrote: Are we creating a ripple effect here?

My intention was to point out that we come at things like this <br/>\nfrom different vantage points - I am a very adventurous eater - I ENJOY <br/>\ntrying out new and different foods, especially regional specialties. And <br/>\nI live in a place where there is tremendous diversity, including <br/>\nrestaurants that specialize in dog meat. Plus, I love shrimp and I don&#39;t <br/>\nsee that as so different than insects, so the idea doesn&#39;t gross me out. <br/>\nI&#39;m sure if one of my daughters got really into this cooking with bugs <br/>\nstuff, I&#39;d get into it, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was surprised, in fact, that all the immediate reactions were so <br/>\ntotally negative. The original poster was asking what would we do? Would <br/>\nwe, as unschoolers feel like we needed to support this interest? My own <br/>\nanswer is that I, personally, don&#39;t see why not? It doesn&#39;t mean that <br/>\nthose who find it distasteful have to actually EAT the stuff - but why <br/>\nnot support the interest in ways that are possible. It isn&#39;t immoral or <br/>\nextremely dangerous. I&#39;d rather support that than motorcycle riding or <br/>\njumping out of airplanes, myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a daughter who has always been extremely squeamish about the <br/>\ninsides of the human body. And another daughter who has always been <br/>\nfascinated by it. We all went to see Body Worlds (the plasticized real <br/>\nbodies traveling exhibit) and Rosie and I were totally absolutely <br/>\nenthralled and could have happily spent a few long days in the exhibit. <br/>\nRoxana rushed through and went outside to wait - she was sickened. <br/>\nLater, she moaned, &quot;What if I have kids who LIKE this kind of thing? How <br/>\nwill I be able to handle that?&quot; I told her she could get their grandma <br/>\nto support that particular interest.&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, anyway, I think the question is part of the bigger issue of how to <br/>\nwe support our children&#39;s interests when we, ourselves, have negative <br/>\nfeelings about them.
