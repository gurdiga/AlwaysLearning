She&#39;s about to catch up with John Holt in terms of hours of  <br/>\nthinking and writing.  She&#39;s passed him in direct experience long ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat Joyce writes, many of you get to see.  When she writes here I&#39;m  <br/>\nthrilled.   I love her page,<br/>\nhttp://joyfullyrejoycing<br/>\nand I&#39;m glad to know her.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause I know her in person, and because she&#39;s shy, I think I should  <br/>\nlet others know some things she does that benefit all of us here.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce lives two hours closer to the sunrise than I do (three hours  <br/>\ncloser than some other moderators), and she gets up early.  Every  <br/>\nmorning when I wake up, Joyce has already dealt with overnight pending  <br/>\nposts on Always Learning, Unschooling Discussion and Unschooling.info/ <br/>\nforum.   These resources work smoothly and well because of Joyce.  She  <br/>\ndoes things that aren&#39;t fun and glorious, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair  <br/>\nthat only a dozen of us have known this for so long.   She&#39;s not the  <br/>\nonly one who helps with the lists that way, but she does more than her  <br/>\nshare.  It doesn&#39;t show from this side, but every day there&#39;s junk  <br/>\nthat needs to be deleted, and way off-topic posts to return, and great  <br/>\nposts from new members to be approved, and their memberships updated  <br/>\nif they&#39;ve been on a while so the posts don&#39;t need to be moderated  <br/>\nanymore.  Because Joyce does this, other people have more time to write.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s often the one who understands the programming and options of the  <br/>\nsites well enough to help people who are having problems, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you, Joyce, very much, for the time and patience and knowledge  <br/>\nyou&#39;ve shared with so many people who didn&#39;t even know it!<br/>\n<br/>\nLove,<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.
