While I refuse to do so, I figured they could use that experience, so I started giving them 75 cents a week.<br/>\nI figured they didn&#39;t know what it was to have &quot;enough&quot; or &quot;not enough&quot; for something. The checkbook always seems<br/>\nbottomless. They both have automatic deposit--I keep a piece of paper in my purse that says how much they have and I<br/>\n(theoretically) update it every Monday.and when they buy something.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian&#39;s five, and he won&#39;t buy stuff from vending machines; he says he&#39;s saving for train stuff. Katherine&#39;s three,<br/>\nand she&#39;ll often get them each one from the vending machine. The last time he wanted a train car and didn&#39;t have<br/>\nenough he convinced Katherine to kick in on that, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically I determine when *I* am going to buy something, and they determine if they want it enough for *them* to buy<br/>\nsomething. For instance, this last train purchase, I was buying $60 worth of track and stuff and he wanted a third<br/>\nThomas (in addition to 3-4 other engines plus cars). I wasn&#39;t going to buy another engine. Sometimes when I say no<br/>\nthey want to pick it up and sometimes not.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically they&#39;re both broke now. Maybe I&#39;ll have to give them a conference bonus--is there likely to be small stuff<br/>\nkids are likely to want to buy for themselves?<br/>\n<br/>\n:-) Diane</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16182,"nextTopicId":16192}}
