They are treated<br/>\nlike family members and sleep in our bed and whatnot. My main concern<br/>\nis that one of my dogs is a pitbull. We raised her from a puppy, and<br/>\nshe is great with our children and all our other pets including cats<br/>\nand rats. But i try very hard to practice responsible pit bull<br/>\nownership, and don&#39;t want any incidents happening with my dog that<br/>\ncould add to the undue bad name this breed already has. I always<br/>\nsupervise my dog being around new people and especailly children, and<br/>\nif i&#39;m not able to be paying attention at the time i will seperate my<br/>\ndog from the situation until i can be paying attention. Well, when<br/>\nthose children came into my house the other night my pit bull was in<br/>\nthe house and no one else was here(my other dog was outside, we don&#39;t<br/>\nleave the pit bull outside when we aren&#39;t home). I know she wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nbite anyone for no reason, but who knows what some mean kid like him<br/>\nmight do to her to try making her reactionary. So there is the concern<br/>\nthat my dogs will start to think it&#39;s normal to have strangers walking<br/>\nthrough the yard and house, and there is also the concern that some<br/>\nmean kid tresspassing in my house might do something really messed up<br/>\nto my dog and get attacked and no one would be here.

If it<br/>\nhappens again, you&#39;ll need to stay away for a few days.&quot; I would say the<br/>\nsame thing and it would not have the effect that dh saying it did (which<br/>\nreally ticked me off at first because I get my meaning across really well<br/>\nthank you, but I believe that may be a &quot;cultural&quot; thing as well...Dad is the<br/>\nhead of the house).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took a long time, but they did eventually conform (I hate that word in<br/>\ngeneral!). After all, they WANT to be here, so doing what they need to do to<br/>\nbe here won out...otherwise, they couldn&#39;t be here. And life is much better<br/>\nfor my kids and dh and me when they&#39;re here...we have a great time together!<br/>\nThe neighbor kids seem much happier and easier-going too...I think they like<br/>\nour ways. It is VERY competitive at their home...they get to relax here and<br/>\nnot &quot;be the best&quot; at everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are some of the loosest people I know, so this was another telling thing<br/>\nfor us. Hell if you can&#39;t follow our loose boundaries, then you DO need our<br/>\nhelp!<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the &quot;in the yard, house when you are not there&quot; part...these kids came<br/>\nin our house and yard when we were gone as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor that one, I called their parents and let them know that the next time it<br/>\nbecame evident that someone was in our house when we were gone, we would<br/>\ncall the police...not on their children, but because that is what we do when<br/>\nsomeone has illegally entered our home. If it happened that it was their<br/>\nchildren in our house then it would be in the police&#39;s hands and we wanted<br/>\nto let them know in advance.

My sons don&#39;t have many friends and they have thought it&#39;s<br/>\ngreat. The kids next door are their same ages. The older boy goes to<br/>\npublic school and the four year old is home all day. Their single<br/>\nMother and Aunt who watch them send them outside to roam the<br/>\nneighborhood almost all the time they are home. When my sons ask in<br/>\nthey can play at their house the boys say they aren&#39;t allowed to go<br/>\ninside because their Mom is napping or whatnot. They are all over at<br/>\nmy house constantly. The problem is that the other kids are VERY<br/>\ndisrespectful of other people&#39;s things and space, and don&#39;t really<br/>\nplay with my sons so much as they just come over to use their stuff<br/>\nand have somewhere to go. They knock on my door constantly at all<br/>\nhours of morning and evening and walk around my house looking in the<br/>\nwindows. They treat my kids&#39;stuff worse than my kids do. They come<br/>\ninto our fenced backyard and take my sons&#39; toys over to their house<br/>\nwithout asking, and we even think they came into our house when we<br/>\nweren&#39;t home briefly the other night( we had left the back door<br/>\nunlocked and they knew we were stepping out to go get dinner). Yes i<br/>\nhave realized we should have locked up better. I have tried to talk to<br/>\nthe older boy, who just lies to me. I&#39;m not sure if i should speak<br/>\nwith his Mom. In all honesty i&#39;d like to tell him he&#39;s not allowed<br/>\nover here because he can&#39;t respect our space and my kids can only play<br/>\nwith him when they are outside, but my sons like having him in the<br/>\nhouse. So what do you do when you feel like your privacy is being<br/>\nviolated by one of your children&#39;s friends and your children want to<br/>\nhave that friend over anyway?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25102,"nextTopicId":25315}}
