The Darwin is a LOT <br/>\neasier to read, apparently, so he might be okay here. The really boring stuff <br/>\nmay be coming to an end. We also pointed out to him that many college students <br/>\nDON&#39;T do every bit of the reading, and that he may be able to let some of it <br/>\ngo, and just back up and read it later if he needs it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Hmm -- on  what &quot;not&quot; to read -- does he care what &quot;grade&quot; he gets (if <br/>\n </span></blockquote>indeed he is getting a grade) and if not -- does he feel (based on what he has <br/>\nread so far and how the class has gone) that his understanding/enjoyment of the <br/>\nclass is enhanced by the reading that he is doing?  If neither is true, I say <br/>\nskim through it, read what catches his eye and skip the rest. <br/>\n<br/>\nI always found it interesting and useful to read the primary sources in the <br/>\nhistory classes I took because it was a window not merely into *what* they <br/>\nthought, but *how* they thought and how they expected a scientific discourse to be <br/>\nconducted -- but if he just wants/needs to know what Darwin thought about <br/>\nGod, or Victorian society, or his fellow passengers on the Beagle, I would think <br/>\nthat he could find a good secondary source that would be less dry. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome tips I used for getting through especially dry info was read it out loud <br/>\nto someone who was at least slightly interested -- some of that &quot;dry&quot; stuff <br/>\nis quite sonorous and balanced and rolling when read out loud.  Skim it with <br/>\nhighlighter in hand, highlighting the key point in each paragraph and then <br/>\nactually &quot;read&quot; only the highlit sections.  Outline the reading as you go along -- <br/>\nfor whatever learning style that I am ; )  writing as I go keeps me tethered <br/>\nto the task, otherwise I find that I am  &quot;reading&quot; without ever processing.  &lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think he cares (or has even thought too much about) the grade. He <br/>\nneeds to learn to skim, and that hasn&#39;t clicked in yet. Maybe THAT&#39;S the skill <br/>\nthat they&#39;re always talking about school being necessary for! Because up until <br/>\nnow he&#39;s only had to read things that interested him, and didn&#39;t need to learn <br/>\nto skim!!! LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem isn&#39;t at all his understanding the material. He understands it <br/>\nand was able to form a very sophisticated analysis of it in his plan for his <br/>\nfirst paper. (One of those moments when you look at your kid and think &quot;How the <br/>\nhell did you figure that out?!&quot;) <br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, the other thing that fascinates me is that he&#39;s truly &quot;getting&quot; the <br/>\nmaterial with just one read-through. I suggested that he could mark the <br/>\npoints he wanted to be sure to remember, etc.-- and he said that it was no problem <br/>\njust remembering.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m beginning to see that basically what he needs is to be okay with NOT <br/>\nreading every bit ofg assigned reading (particularly since he&#39;s doing the <br/>\nDiscussion section), and he needs to learn to skim. And I guess sometimes to have his <br/>\nMama make him mint tea and peanut butter and fluff sandwiches. <br/>\n<br/>\nThank all of you for your advice!<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Need Schooly Advice for an Unschooler","postDate":"1065585615","msgId":16541,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNlLjM1ZThiZWE0LjJjYjRlNWNmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":16530,"nextInTopic":16551,"prevInTime":16540,"nextInTime":16542,"topicId":16523,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/7/03 10:28:43 AM, SandraDodd@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1877704624\">In a message dated 10/7/03 10:28:43 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; See if there is a Cliff&#39;s or Monarch&#39;s notes booklet on that.

Or just experiences of your own that I <br/>\ncan <br/>\npass along to him to reassure him? <br/>\n###########################<br/>\n<br/>\nIs the book(s) he is reading a reprint of Darwin&#39;s books or, is the book like <br/>\na regular textbook with chapters and headings under the chapters with little <br/>\nblurbs under pictures and those typical shaded boxes with extra details and <br/>\ncharts in them? If it is like a textbook; read each of the headings under the <br/>\nchapter, read the first few sentences or first paragraph and last paragraph, <br/>\nread the blurbs and shaded boxes. Review the chapter review at the end of each <br/>\nchapter first as well. That way he gets a good overview of the chapter and can <br/>\nlook for the key points. Right now I am helping a friend of mine who is a <br/>\nprofessor grade tests. She gives essay type tests and they usually consist of five <br/>\nor six questions and the class can choose three to answer. When we grade these <br/>\npapers the first thing we do is glance over each paper looking for key <br/>\npoints. We do this because each test turned in can have anywhere from four to six <br/>\npages of essay for each question. That makes for over four hundred pages to <br/>\ngrade for the whole class. If we see the key points that need to be addressed for <br/>\neach question, then we can read more in-depth and grade accordingly. That is <br/>\nhow I would suggest he approach the reading assignments. Read the chapter <br/>\nreview at the end of each chapter first, that will give him the key points to look <br/>\nfor, then go back over the chapter and read for those points. Also, keep notes <br/>\non what the professor lectures on during class and in the discussion time <br/>\nafter. Then when doing the reading, he can look for those particular nuances of <br/>\nthe professor. Is there a study group? Maybe he could join that as well. <br/>\nSometimes study groups split the reading between the members. The only problem with <br/>\nthat is I wouldn&#39;t rely solely on what others have to say about their reading <br/>\nassignment, but it is a way to see what/how others view the assignment.<br/>\n<br/>\nA side note on taking notes; learn to write without vowels as much as <br/>\npossible!

If neither is true, I say skim through it, read what catches his eye and skip the rest. <br/>\n<br/>\nI always found it interesting and useful to read the primary sources in the history classes I took because it was a window not merely into *what* they thought, but *how* they thought and how they expected a scientific discourse to be conducted -- but if he just wants/needs to know what Darwin thought about God, or Victorian society, or his fellow passengers on the Beagle, I would think that he could find a good secondary source that would be less dry. <br/>\n<br/>\n Some tips I used for getting through especially dry info was read it out loud to someone who was at least slightly interested -- some of that &quot;dry&quot; stuff is quite sonorous and balanced and rolling when read out loud.  Skim it with highlighter in hand, highlighting the key point in each paragraph and then actually &quot;read&quot; only the highlit sections.  Outline the reading as you go along -- for whatever learning style that I am ; )  writing as I go keeps me tethered to the task, otherwise I find that I am  &quot;reading&quot; without ever processing.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-Cat <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:KathrynJB@...\">KathrynJB@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, October 07, 2003 7:22 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Need Schooly Advice for an Unschooler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  This is a slightly bizarre question.
