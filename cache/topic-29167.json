No Algebra???&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n     Well I do have answers to this.  Most people who ask about  <br/>\nalgebra don&#39;t know what it is, outside of being a school math  <br/>\ncourse.  That one&#39;s pretty easy, but here are some stories...  http:// <br/>\nsandradodd.com/timestables<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But if you don&#39;t make them do chores, they&#39;ll treat you like a maid<br/>\nand NEVER do ANYTHING!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n       That hasn&#39;t been my experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;They NEED their rest! If they can stay up as late as they want, when<br/>\nwill they sleep?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n        Marty has stayed up all night ONCE.  Kirby has, but only when  <br/>\nhe&#39;s slept all the following day.    They sleep lots.  Probably the  <br/>\nsame people who want to rag about bedtime enforcement would also  <br/>\ncomplain if I didn&#39;t wake them up after eight hours, saying &quot;Eight  <br/>\nhours is enough,&quot; and more is sloth or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;No parental controls on the TV or computer? What about child<br/>\nmolesters?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI LOVE THIS ONE!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nKids whose parents make them go out and play are in way more danger  <br/>\nthan those who are sitting in a chair, in the house, at a computer.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat kind of parents would create a home environment which would make  <br/>\nsecretly meeting a stranger seem desireable?  (Lots of them,  <br/>\nunfortunately, but I&#39;m not one of them.)<br/>\n&#39;<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"thinking and choices and stuff","postDate":"1181239087","msgId":29167,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDOTc3NDQ4QTAxRjM1MC05NUMtQjNEREB3ZWJtYWlsLWRiMTIuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":29169,"prevInTime":29166,"nextInTime":29168,"topicId":29167,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My thought is that too many people accept the mainstream ideas withOUT thinking at all.

They don&#39;t understand that they have <br/>\noptions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest eye-opener for me was when my sisters-in-inlaw ambushed me <br/>\nand Ben several years ago about unschooling. It happens every day on <br/>\nthese lists, but coming from family all at once was something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey had all this &quot;research&quot; to throw at us.

What about child <br/>\nmolesters?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey just couldn&#39;t wrap their heads around the idea that my children <br/>\nsimply have CHOICES.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, they may have cake and ice cream for breakfast, but they CHOOSE to <br/>\nmake eggs and chicken and a bagel.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, they can play games all day, but they CHOOSE to jump on the <br/>\ntrampoline and swim and read and cook and nap.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, they can watch whatever they want on TV, but they CHOOSE to watch <br/>\nSpongeBob and That 70s show and Good Eats!<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, they have no chores, but they CHOOSE to clean and help with *many* <br/>\nthings around the house---out of love and thoughtfulness and kindness.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, they have no bedtimes, so they sleep when they are tired and get <br/>\nup when they are rested---remember they don&#39;t *have* to be up at 6:00am <br/>\nfor the bus!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I have been where they are. I was a traditional, conventional <br/>\nparent (as were our own parents). But I changed. I tried something new. <br/>\nI believe that I made the best choice. Because, I believed, there WAS a <br/>\nchoice to be made.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest thing that pisses me off is that they are coming at this <br/>\n from ONE point of view. They know no other. They&#39;ve done NO research. <br/>\nThey&#39;ve never even questioned *why* they are doing what they&#39;re doing. <br/>\nThey simply *DO*. No questions. No explanations. That&#39;s just the way it <br/>\nis.<br/>\n<br/>\n*I*, on the other hand, have *been* where they are. I was raised in a <br/>\nvery similar manner (and Ben was raised WITH them in the SAME manner). <br/>\nI have been to school. I have sent my child to school. I have <br/>\nsubstitute taught in school. I have taken my child out of school. And I <br/>\nhave decided to unschool. I have BEEN on all sides of the fence, as <br/>\nwell as ON it; and I have made the best possible choice that *I* can <br/>\nsee to make.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHEY, on the other hand, are still on the same side of the fence (but <br/>\nare quickly making a brick wall out of that rail fence so that their <br/>\nkids can&#39;t see us on the FUN side!), with no knowledge of the other <br/>\npossibiilities. They are uninformed and misinformed. HOW can they have <br/>\nan intelligent conversation on any of these issues? Well, they *can&#39;t*!<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one chooses to unschool without questioning. That&#39;s the nature of <br/>\nthe beast. Parents who aren&#39;t going to question things---every <br/>\nthing---are not going to unschool. It just won&#39;t happen. The radical <br/>\nunschoolers I know are passionate about questioning and learning more. <br/>\nThey don&#39;t let things rest. They keep looking and asking and thinking <br/>\nabout things. They&#39;re voracious learners themselves, so they are <br/>\nexcellent models for their children.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose who choose to &quot;go with the flow&quot; and who accept whatever they are <br/>\ntold and who refrain from thinking too much will be modeling for their <br/>\nchildren too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAOL now offers free email to everyone.
