The  <br/>\nworst case is that people have preconceived notions of what  <br/>\n&quot;autistic&quot; means and they can relate to a person based on that,  <br/>\nrather than based on the reality of the individual. Well - the worst  <br/>\nis when people who have some authority over the child do this.  <br/>\nAnother danger is when a child believes that their diagnosis makes  <br/>\nthem incompetent - I&#39;ve seen that with kids I&#39;ve known.  And, this  <br/>\nmay not apply to autism as a label, but there are also self- <br/>\nfulfilling prophecies because of labels -- we all know the studies in  <br/>\nwhich teachers are told they are being give a class of gifted kids  <br/>\n(even though the class is, in fact, a random sample of kids) and, lo  <br/>\nand behold, the kids excel beyond the typical class. Other teachers  <br/>\nare told they are being given a class of special needs kids and, no  <br/>\nbig surprise, the teacher sees the kids as having all kinds of  <br/>\nproblems and the kids don&#39;t achieve up to average levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nI SO understand the relief that you described your husband having - I  <br/>\nknow that even when we have symptoms of physical problems, sometimes  <br/>\nit can be such a relief just to give it a name and know that there  <br/>\nare others who share the symptoms, etc. I&#39;ve had RLS (Restless Leg  <br/>\nSyndrome) for most of my life - but didn&#39;t know it had a name and  <br/>\nthat other people had it too, until fairly recently (because it got  <br/>\nbad enough that my need for medical help became very apparent). It  <br/>\nwas certainly a relief to know it wasn&#39;t just me, that it was a real  <br/>\nsyndrome and not &quot;all in my head.&quot; So - with autistic characteristics  <br/>\nI can imagine that the relief would be even greater.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are times that labels are useful, for sure. Just like John Holt  <br/>\ndecided not to give out information about his own college degrees,  <br/>\nwanting his ideas to stand on their own, I decided many years ago to  <br/>\ntry not to utilize commonly assigned labels in describing my children  <br/>\n- but instead to actually describe the individual child&#39;s specific  <br/>\ncharacteristics and let those stand on their own. I didn&#39;t want to  <br/>\ncall my child ADD or ADHD or &quot;gifted&quot; or &quot;spirited&quot; or whatever the  <br/>\ncurrent trendy label was - and my reason was that I think those  <br/>\nlabels mistakenly indicate that we know something about the child -  <br/>\nbut we don&#39;t know ANYTHING much from those labels, in fact. And I so  <br/>\noften saw the risks become reality - kids lived up to their labels.  <br/>\nSo - there are TIMES for labels - when needing a diagnosis in order  <br/>\nto get treatment is an obvious time. And if my kids were in school,  <br/>\nI&#39;d be getting them labeled in order to get certain services, too.  <br/>\nAnd, yes, to find support might be one of those times - I&#39;m on an RLS  <br/>\nemail list, for example.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128461194,"authorName":"Susan McGlohn","from":"Susan McGlohn &lt;wifeto.vegman@...&gt;","profile":"wifetovegman2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] lots of input","postDate":"1136528290","msgId":23819,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYuMS4xLjEuMi4yMDA2MDEwNjAwMTQ1Ni4wMWI4MDAwOEBpbmNvbWluZy52ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGRwa2Zndis1dHAyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGRwa2Zndis1dHAyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":23818,"nextInTopic":23820,"prevInTime":23818,"nextInTime":23820,"topicId":23785,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

In our case, we would be avoiding parts of my son. Same for all kids<br/>\nI assume. We all ARE different. Having words that describe with accuracy can<br/>\ncertainly help understand one&#39;s self and others as well. I mean, it&#39;s not as<br/>\nif the word &quot;autistic&quot; is a BAD thing, is it?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like there is a great resistant to use the word &quot;autistic&quot; &lt;insert<br/>\nany other label&gt;. I&#39;d like to explore that for a sec. The way I see it,<br/>\n&quot;autistic&quot; is only a *bad* word if you see it as meaning limiting and<br/>\ndebilitating and damaged. For two of my family, it has opened limitless<br/>\ndoors and has meant joy and understanding and appreciation in what otherwise<br/>\nwas a very confusing existence in this world.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has helped my husband ENORMOUSLY...more on that in a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt *seems* a reason people don&#39;t want to use labels is the thought that the<br/>\nlabel creates a box.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor us, it was just the opposite. Having this descriptive word provided<br/>\nexplanations that finally opened the box.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son said a couple of weeks ago to the teacher of a drama class he is<br/>\ntaking, &quot;Oh. You&#39;re probably wondering why I am so blunt about what I think.<br/>\nYou see, I am working on making that easier on people around me, but it is<br/>\nsomewhat hardwired for me. Please don&#39;t be offended. If you ask my opinion,<br/>\nI will give you the honest answer, no matter how offensive it seems. You<br/>\nmight know about it as an autistic thing.&quot; The moment he used the word<br/>\n&quot;autistic&quot; the teacher suddenly realized that he wasn&#39;t an asshole, he<br/>\nreally spoke without the editing that most of us do. She was MUCH more<br/>\nunderstanding after that. The label gave her some information to work with<br/>\nwithout him having to say &quot;I have sensory issues and my brain really hasn&#39;t<br/>\nfigured out yet what is okay to say to people and what isn&#39;t, no matter how<br/>\nmuch great modeling I&#39;ve had in my home my whole life and I&#39;m walking in and<br/>\nout of the room because I can only take the noise and fluorescent lights for<br/>\na few minutes at a time and my bladder gets REAL active in situations like<br/>\nthis and I know I look like an adult and should have better manners but I<br/>\nreally am doing the best I can ...&quot; etc. &quot;Autistic tendencies&quot; has been much<br/>\neasier for him to say.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe knew that this teacher was a little freaked out by him and because of<br/>\nknowing the word &quot;autistic&quot; he already had mechanisms to help him navigate<br/>\nthrough the world of &quot;normal&quot; people (no there is no such thing as<br/>\nnormal...I know...he knows...just using it in this example, with quotation<br/>\nmarks). He has googled autism and sought out on his own resources for<br/>\nself-help and self-awareness. And is a happy and healthy creature indeed!<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has armed himself with some pretty dang useful tools that I would never<br/>\nhave thought to give him. It came from having a word to describe some of his<br/>\ndifferences. Avoiding his differences would not help him in any way that I<br/>\ncan see.<br/>\n<br/>\nJUDGING his differences is another story. THAT is the area where I see work<br/>\nneeding to be done. But not avoiding.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now for my husband&#39;s story, if you are still reading :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was &quot;diagnosed&quot; with Asperger&#39;s Syndrome at age 50. He says this was the<br/>\nbiggest relief of his life. Because his life, particularly his younger<br/>\nyears, were spent wondering why he couldn&#39;t do things others could, why he<br/>\ndidn&#39;t fit in and didn&#39;t even know what &quot;fitting in&quot; meant, why people were<br/>\nalways getting mad at him, why he could understand so many things that most<br/>\npeople couldn&#39;t and why other people were so stupid. His parents hadn&#39;t a<br/>\nclue as to why he was this way and ignored to their best ability his<br/>\ndifferences. Didn&#39;t try to help him navigate in this world, and in fact,<br/>\njoined the bullies and the rigid teachers and the cranky neighbors in just<br/>\nthinking he was weird and defective and beating him up in one way or<br/>\nanother. Not like any of us, I know, and that is a great difference between<br/>\nour children and this story. But the core of this story is that Charles KNEW<br/>\nhe had differences, but no one would address it or help him or give him<br/>\nwords to understand. Only lack of words that left him hanging.

Kinda like <br/>\nchurches. Each group gets to define who and what they are though they <br/>\nwelcome and depend upon (with certain restrictions) public exploration <br/>\nand membership.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s kinda like running a 4-H group or a community book discussion <br/>\ngroup. People can join and participate, and even have respectful <br/>\ndisagreement and input on the topics, but that&#39;s not the same thing as <br/>\ngoing in and insisting that people discuss a totally different book or <br/>\nthat their approach to the activity is all wrong.

There comes a point at which, <br/>\nimo, that multiplicity/ diversity actually takes away from in depth <br/>\nexploration rather than adding to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nReally, what&#39;s wrong with an on-topic, lightly moderated or even heavily <br/>\nmoderated list? As long as there&#39;s freedom in list-making, in other <br/>\nwords not a monopoly on a topic, then the freedom is there and can&#39;t be <br/>\nlost.

It&#39;s  <br/>\nnot the best.  I&#39;m thinking of someone years and YEARS ago on  <br/>\n*Prodigy who was bemoaning her kids not staying together on their  <br/>\nlessons (she wasn&#39;t an unschooler; most weren&#39;t there, then).  The  <br/>\ngirl would happily have done several language arts lessons in one  <br/>\nday, while the boy could hardly finish one.  The mom had to force the  <br/>\ngirl to stop, and force the boy to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo my very sensible (&quot;sensible&quot; in the range of &quot;DUH!&quot; I thought)  <br/>\nsuggestion that she let the girl do as much as she wanted, and help  <br/>\nthe boy with his, or let him do something else entirely, she said  <br/>\nthat I could not possibly BEGIN to understand the situation, as I was  <br/>\nnot the mother of twins.<br/>\n<br/>\nRejecting other people&#39;s ideas because they&#39;re not the mothers of  <br/>\nwhatever particular &quot;problem&quot; a parent has labelled is legal in all  <br/>\nEnglish-speaking countries as far as I&#39;m aware, but just because  <br/>\nsomething&#39;s legal doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the best plan.   Had that mom  <br/>\njoined a list of homeschooling parents of twins, she might or might  <br/>\nnot have gotten better information, but past the early childhood  <br/>\nshared language likelihood and the lifelong comparisons and  <br/>\nirritations, learning works the same way with a twin as with any  <br/>\nother person.  A twins group could have given her some good ideas,  <br/>\nbut couldn&#39;t have provided everything in the whole wide world she  <br/>\nneeded.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it was, she kinda glommed onto me, and I&#39;m reminded of this  <br/>\nbecause I pulled out two fat file folders of things she sent me-- <br/>\nphotos and long letters and copies of handouts she had made for  <br/>\ncrafts and painting classes she taught.  It&#39;s some very cool stuff,  <br/>\nbut because I made suggestions she really liked, she thought *I*  <br/>\nshould be the source of all her input.  That went on for a few years,  <br/>\nwith me making lots of suggestions for other sources and resources,  <br/>\nand her writing and saying how clever I was to have suggested that  <br/>\n(rather than going to those other places for other ideas).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t mind people recommending other lists in addition to this  <br/>\none.  I think everyone should have several sources of information.  I  <br/>\nassume that all-to-most of the people on this list are also on  <br/>\nUnschoolingDiscussion (and if you&#39;re not, you might look into it!).   <br/>\nSometimes I throw the link out to other lists ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandadodd.com/\">http://sandadodd.com/</a> <br/>\nlists/other ) not because I want to suggest people should leave this  <br/>\nlist, or that one, but because if they&#39;re hungry for more input  <br/>\nquickly, more than one list is a way to get more ideas, other voices  <br/>\nand more points of view.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it because of our culture&#39;s experience with religion that some  <br/>\npeople tend toward choosing one list and dropping all others? Is it  <br/>\nlike changing churches or something?<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes , it seems, some want to just have one source and otherwise  <br/>\nthey feel disloyal or in danger of terminal confusion.  Like their  <br/>\nsoul won&#39;t be saved, or they&#39;ll have sinned by going to a  <br/>\nPresbyterian service if they&#39;re Pentecostal.  But if you want to  <br/>\nlearn about Christianity,  you have to go to LOTS of kinds of  <br/>\nchurches.  And if you want to know about religion other than  <br/>\nChristianity, you have to explore, and read, and meet people and  <br/>\nwatch movies and...<br/>\n<br/>\nIf people want to know about unschooling, they need to know something  <br/>\nabout structured homeschooling and unit studies, so they know what  <br/>\nthey could do and why they&#39;ve chosen not to.  it will help  to know  <br/>\nenough about homeschooling in general to carry on a conversation with  <br/>\npeople who aren&#39;t even homeschoolers who know a little or a lot about  <br/>\nit.  It helps to know enough about unschooling&#39;s range and history to  <br/>\nbe able to understand and defend what you&#39;re doing.  That&#39;s unlikely  <br/>\nto come from one list or one website or one book.<br/>\n<br/>\nMix it up, explore, and don&#39;t forget that no one has gathered all of  <br/>\nany one sort of person all in one places.  They&#39;re out and about.   <br/>\nSome are using labels and some aren&#39;t.  Go with the principles and  <br/>\nideas and underlying truths of learning, and it won&#39;t matter so much  <br/>\nanymore about the particulars.  Learn enough about learning that you  <br/>\nthe mom (or dad) really get it.  Learning isn&#39;t just for kids.  We  <br/>\ncan feel how WE learn and grow and that helps us understand how other  <br/>\npeople do.    Yes there are differences in preference and  <br/>\n&quot;intelligences&quot; (I mean Gardner-style, not IQ style).  Some MUCH  <br/>\nprefer books to conferences, or vice versa.  Some would like to talk  <br/>\nfor hours, and others would rather sit back and just watch and  <br/>\nthink.
