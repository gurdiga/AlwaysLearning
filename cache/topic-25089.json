I saw size 1 heelies in the store while we <br/>\nwere buying a new pair yesterday of size 5 heelies for my 6 year <br/>\nold.  He likes them a bit big I think because they run small (lots <br/>\nof padding) and he has a wide foot.  So, they&#39;re a bit long, but <br/>\ncomfortably wide (same foot style as me!)<br/>\n<br/>\nR&#39;s friends wear them and they&#39;re a bit big on some of them, but <br/>\nthey enjoy them - maybe just tie them tighter?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve also gotten comments, on these and the ones before (folding <br/>\nwheels that went in and out) including getting &#39;spoken to&#39; at <br/>\nLegoland, being told they were not allowed (I never saw any notice <br/>\nabout that) and that if we insisted upon letting him wear them, we <br/>\nwould have to accept any liability associated with that.  I nodded <br/>\nand waited for her to go away. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding those one that have folding wheels, I do NOT recommend <br/>\nthose except for the most mild child because R had those broken in <br/>\ntwo months since he wore them every day with the wheels always out <br/>\n(and I do mean the metal brackets snapped off in addition to the <br/>\nwheels going one at a time). :) <br/>\n<br/>\nThose were the ones he chose the first time, but the fun wore off <br/>\nwhen the wheels did. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe heelies are of MUCH higher quality. We had them for two months <br/>\nbefore we forgot them at the park and they looked just as good as <br/>\nnew. I hope the kid that found them is enjoying them. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust keep your eye out for a sale because they run at $89, but we <br/>\nbought each pair for $49, also partially because we didn&#39;t need the <br/>\nplate and tool that the salesman recommended since heelies aren&#39;t <br/>\nallowed in schools. R never takes his wheels out! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s also mutually fun to go places quicker, since he just grabs on <br/>\nmy arm and is pulled along. :)  We kept stumbling over ourselves for <br/>\nthe few days we were without the heelies.<br/>\n<br/>\nc.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;lilith_pouia&quot; <br/>\n&lt;lilith_pouia@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;nellebelle&quot; &lt;nellebelle@&gt;<br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Heely roller skates?  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.heelys.com/\">http://www.heelys.com/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mary Ellen<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- What&#39;s heelying?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; After looking at that website i wish my sons had some, they would <br/>\n </span></blockquote>love<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; it.
