I<br/>\nwas shocked at the prices because it seems just like yesterday (but<br/>\nactually 8 or 9 years ago) that you could pick up a system for $10<br/>\nthat included a handful of games and all sorts of accessories. I<br/>\nremember a thrift store in a nearby town had amassed a collection of<br/>\nsomething like 90 units and they were practically giving them away.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut now there is a big demand for good working systems because people<br/>\nstill enjoy playing but the units aren&#39;t lasting as long as the games.<br/>\nEven some of the old games are becoming pricey now as they get harder<br/>\nto find. We thought we could find a cheap Nintendo package to buy for<br/>\nthe kids, but they are well on their way to collector&#39;s status! The<br/>\nSega systems (Genesis and Saturn) are the same way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe store we were at had a clone system and the guy who owns the place<br/>\n(a real video game geek who seems to know his stuff) said he&#39;s found<br/>\nthe clone units to be better than buying an old Nintendo unit (he had<br/>\nsome of those for sale, too). The one we looked at could play games<br/>\nfrom several different Nintendo platforms and being new (rather than<br/>\nused and 10 years old) was another plus. I think it was around $60 at<br/>\nthe store, which wasn&#39;t much more than the old systems were selling<br/>\nfor on eBay when we last checked.<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Susan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29925,"nextTopicId":29944}}
