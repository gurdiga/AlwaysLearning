It  <br/>\npaints a picture of mom decides the right way to believe. And all the  <br/>\ndiscussion is about the right way of viewing the world of food. All  <br/>\nthe exploring is about the right way of experiencing the world of  <br/>\nfood. And everyone happily agrees because mom is right.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether that&#39;s what it&#39;s like or not in your home, for people to build  <br/>\ntheir understanding of unschooling, it&#39;s important to not work with  <br/>\nthose kinds of images.<br/>\n<br/>\nA more helpful image might be this: For every family there will be a  <br/>\ndefault set of values and preferences that the parents use to make  <br/>\ndecisions when no one else cares. For instance, a radically  <br/>\nunschooling vegetarian mom&#39;s meals will include any meat her kids want  <br/>\n(as well as anything else) into a larger picture that will look more  <br/>\nvegetarian than your average American home.<br/>\n<br/>\nMom&#39;s values are likely to have a greater positive impact if she  <br/>\nshares &quot;why this rather than that&quot; about the parts that are left up to  <br/>\nher to decide rather than the parts the kids are exploring.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean she should never say anything. *If* the kids trust  <br/>\nthat she&#39;s lending her experience or even preference to help them  <br/>\ndecide, then advice will sound different than if she&#39;s using it as a  <br/>\nbarrier between them and what they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, if a child wants hot dogs, then &quot;Is it okay if we get  <br/>\nthese ones without nitrates,&quot; will be a way of mom using her values to  <br/>\nhelp narrow the choices and make the decision easier. The child will  <br/>\nsee the values as helpful and useful and she can pass on why she  <br/>\nprefers the nitrateless ones as a bit of information for the child to  <br/>\ndraw on in the future if he wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if a child wants the kind of hot dogs he had at the ball park the  <br/>\nmom&#39;s &quot;These ones without nitrates are better,&quot; will be a roadblock  <br/>\nbetween the child and what he wants. The child won&#39;t experience the  <br/>\nvalues as helpful but as tools for mom to control what he eats.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy default for shopping is sales and thrift stores (and eBay and used  <br/>\nstuff on Amazon) but I never limited Kathryn to those. (It&#39;s hard to  <br/>\nget the newest Pokemon game at a thrift store ;-) I didn&#39;t have an  <br/>\nagenda of her one day agreeing that shopping thrift stores is better  <br/>\nthan full price stores. The goal was -- as with all choices -- for her  <br/>\nto experience the pros and cons of each and make thoughtful decisions  <br/>\nabout what would be a better choice for her for whatever she wanted.  <br/>\nSince looking for discounts was always a way to help her get what she  <br/>\nwanted (and as a bonus save money) she sees them as a big positive. I  <br/>\nthink she&#39;s even more inclined to not want something if she can&#39;t find  <br/>\nit cheap than I am because she never felt pressure to believe my  <br/>\n&quot;right&quot; way.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Feeling conflicted about food","postDate":"1296664495","msgId":59395,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1RkM4NTU3LUQ3ODQtNDA0My1BNzUwLTI5MzVGMDFFMTk2MUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGltUFlvQ2UzV0U3Qz1KRk1IcTQ2YlhRK1JzcVRYb050MS1wa2NrWUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDY0OTUxNC43Njk4NC5xbUB3ZWIxMTQ2MTcubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPiA8QUFOTGtUaW49b1RGNTRWbVM3aUhpMjRtVDJPVF80Qi1aV3k5dDA0V1dTRGhHQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8N0Q3MDlCMEYtOTE5RC00Rjc0LTlBNTEtRjY0RDA0QTM1RUZDQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8QUFOTGtUaW5pRGlTQzVndjI4cStuMnViZDI0ZU04MnZLLV9yUmUxSDBDTXgtQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8Q0QyQTkwODctREI2My00MDhDLUI1QTYtQkY2MUFCQTgxRjQ0QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8QUFOTGtUaW1QWW9DZTNXRTdDPUpGTUhxNDZiWFErUnNxVFhvTnQxLXBrY2tZQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":59394,"nextInTopic":59397,"prevInTime":59394,"nextInTime":59396,"topicId":59320,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-What I was responding to was the comment that information can range from propaganda to horror story.-=- That s not the full range.

So far I haven&#39;t seen one of them want to research something *I* have issues with, though.

His bio mom has biiiiig opinions on the matter and while he doesn&#39;t live with her and doesn&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; do what she tells him, he has found it easier, in terms of their relationship, to follow along with her ideas than to do any kind of research on his own. That&#39;s one of the ways relationship issues play into decision making. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been doing a little research on the side, looking for ways to support him and it has been a bit frustrating to keep running up against someone who has very strong opinions saying &quot;do it this way or you&#39;ll be sick forever and die&quot;.

That&#39;s a prejudice to examine carefully. If it is true, then unschooled kids should have abyssmal diets. If unschooled kids don&#39;t then what else is going on to make kids more powerful than additives and advertising? <br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids (and age matters) are very drawn to visually appealing foods. My dd was like that when she was young, although not my stepson. It helped her to have very nutritionally dense foods that were as lovely as commercial foods - helped in the sense that she was more likely to eat a variety of things. Instead of railing against commercial ploys to suck in little children, I took some pages from their book and prettied up my offerings. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids (and adults for that matter) are more likely to choose foods that are convenient to eat. Kids are busy people! They don&#39;t necessarily want to wait for you to prepare something when there&#39;s a perfectly good pack of chips that only needs to be opened. So having foods available before kids are hungry or even bringing food to where a busy child is playing, can go a long way. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Whether it&#39;s a moment of dietary preferences or not there is some pretty nasty &quot;food&quot; out there. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also some nasty memories in a loooooot of adults&#39; minds around food and control. It doesn&#39;t help your relationship with your kids - or their relationship with food or their bodies - to start labling foods as &quot;nasty&quot;. I&#39;m not a fan of marshmallows, for instance, but my dd loves them. A week ago, I bought her a whole bag of them and she promptly had bowl of marshmallows. I don&#39;t think she&#39;s touched them since - the bag is in the same place with (I think) the same number of marshmallows as a week ago. It wasn&#39;t a stellar choice in the moment in terms of nutrition, but she enjoyed eating them, and we had a nice time watching a movie while she did, and snuggling. I had a moment of &quot;oh geez, is she really going to eat All Those Marshmallows?!?&quot; but kept that to myself and I&#39;m glad I did. The marshmallows became a non-issue, just a snack on a snuggly afternoon with mom. That&#39;s better than the ongoing drama of rationing out a bag of marshmallows over a week. Its healthier in so very many ways. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":217568290,"authorName":"Laureen","from":"Laureen &lt;splashing@...&gt;","profile":"elementalgrrl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Feeling conflicted about food","postDate":"1296585148","msgId":59370,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGluPW9URjU0Vm1TN2lIaTI0bVQyT1RfNEItWld5OXQwNFdXU0RoR0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDY0OTUxNC43Njk4NC5xbUB3ZWIxMTQ2MTcubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDY0OTUxNC43Njk4NC5xbUB3ZWIxMTQ2MTcubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":59353,"nextInTopic":59372,"prevInTime":59369,"nextInTime":59371,"topicId":59320,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Heya ...

This isn&#39;t. This is a list about <br/>\nunschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be easy to get caught up in one cause or another. It is easy for some <br/>\npeople to find lots of political/spiritual/ecological ideas or movements that <br/>\nthey feel passionate about. The goal with unschooling is to recognise that any <br/>\nthing that is your passion is your passion. It isn&#39;t necessarily your child&#39;s. <br/>\nFor some people that means that they can&#39;t unschool, at least not radically, <br/>\nbecause they can&#39;t let their child play with toys from China. For them the <br/>\nimportation of toys from China carries with it too many personal costs and <br/>\ncompromises to their political outlook or concerns to overcome. So they as a <br/>\nparent put that limitation on their relationship with their child. For some one <br/>\nelse it may be that they can&#39;t unschool when it comes to their faith. They can&#39;t <br/>\ntake the risk to their child&#39;s soul. So that parent puts that limitation on <br/>\ntheir relationship with their child. The more distance a parent puts between <br/>\nthem and their child, the more reasons to say no, not this one, the less their <br/>\nrelationship can flourish, the less they are working in partnership together, <br/>\nthe less well unschool will work. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am often impressed with the awareness Simon and Linnaea have of the greater <br/>\nworld around them. They are very good at making relatively informed choices. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think it is possible to be fully informed about many things. Information <br/>\ngets all fractal when you get too close. That&#39;s why unschooling works, <br/>\neverything is linked, or, at least, it&#39;s possible to perceive links between most <br/>\nthings. So knowledge that starts about one thing moves out and in and around <br/>\nlots and lots of other things. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Simon or Linnaea were interested in the politics and policies of their food I <br/>\ncould do a lot to help them find information. But they aren&#39;t that interested. <br/>\nThey like to eat what they like to eat and they feel pretty good about David and <br/>\nI finding it for them and preparing it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Tara Wagner &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:howlinghoyden@...\">howlinghoyden@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI take it you do not live in the bay area CA?

If you have a prediction that certain foods will cause certain <br/>\n<br/>\nkinds of behaviour it is much more likely to come true than if you don&#39;t start <br/>\n<br/>\nwith that bias. That&#39;s why so much testing of pharmaceuticals is done with <br/>\n<br/>\ndouble blind, randomised trials. There is some hope that the bias that the <br/>\n<br/>\nhumans bring to bear on the study will have less of an effect. And even with <br/>\n<br/>\nthat, it is still hard to tease bias from real response to treatment. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen David and I stepped away from limiting what foods Simon and Linnaea ate and <br/>\n<br/>\nstepped into helping to get them what they wanted to eat plus the things we <br/>\n<br/>\nthought they would enjoy eating it wasn&#39;t hands off. If I noticed Linnaea going <br/>\n<br/>\nand getting bag after bag of Wotsits (similar to twisties or cheese puffs in the <br/>\n<br/>\nU.S.) I would put together a platter of some other options for her, or ask if <br/>\n<br/>\nshe was hungry for something other than wotsits and needed me to get it. When <br/>\n<br/>\nthey were littler they ate smaller amounts at more frequent intervals, they got <br/>\n<br/>\nhungry more often. So keeping easy to put together options to hand made it much <br/>\n<br/>\neasier for me to give them more choices. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra has kept something I wrote from ages ago that has a list of some of the <br/>\n<br/>\noptions available in our home: &quot;There is free access to food in our house.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two bowlfuls of starburst fruit chews on the kitchen table and carrots <br/>\n<br/>\nand celery cut up and floating in water in the fridge as per my Grandmother; <br/>\n<br/>\nthere are packets of crisps in the cupboard with weetabix cereal and muesli <br/>\n<br/>\ncereal and whatever other kind of cereal; there is dried squid and sheets of <br/>\n<br/>\nnori and crackers and peanut butter and chocolate chip oatmeal cookies and ice <br/>\n<br/>\ncream and, and, and…  All things get eaten.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe all things get eaten line, that wasn&#39;t true. I&#39;ve thrown out a lot of <br/>\n<br/>\nstarburst fruit chews, &#39;cause they get melty. And I used carrots from a bowl of <br/>\n<br/>\nwater in the fridge the other day in stock because the carrots are a little too <br/>\n<br/>\nsweet for Simon&#39;s or Linnaea&#39;s current preferences. Ice cream sits in the <br/>\n<br/>\nfreezer for an age. At the moment crisps are having a bit of a revival. But they <br/>\n<br/>\noften wait for some friend of Simon or Linnaea to come over and eat them. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBalance doesn&#39;t happen every day, either. Whenever I&#39;d get nervous about what I <br/>\n<br/>\nfelt was an unbalanced diet from Simon or Linnaea I&#39;d keep notes. A day might be <br/>\n<br/>\ntoo short to see the true picture. One day might have three donuts in it, but <br/>\n<br/>\ntwo days might have three donuts in it, bagels, burritos, carrots, celery, <br/>\n<br/>\napples, and three days might have three donuts, bagels, carrots, celery, apples, <br/>\n<br/>\nstrawberries, potatoes, wotsits, burritos, weetabix, hummus, bread and butter, <br/>\n<br/>\nramen and on and on. A moment of dietary preference doesn&#39;t make up a diet, it&#39;s <br/>\n<br/>\njust that moment. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if what you are seeing is a kind of creeping yellow peril in a bowl of <br/>\n<br/>\nyellow twisties than they will be writ large on your children&#39;s experience, for <br/>\n<br/>\nyou. If you see this extruded snack food as filled with potential for anger and <br/>\n<br/>\nhostilities and unhappiness it will be hard for it to just be a moment of <br/>\n<br/>\ndietary preference in your children&#39;s day. It will have a huge rippling effect. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf they&#39;d had homemade bread and butter and an apple and had a hostile moment <br/>\n<br/>\nafterwards I assume that the food would have had no bearing on the anger? It may <br/>\n<br/>\nbe worth examining your causal links in your head. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, if you are making a list of what they eat, you could add in a list of <br/>\n<br/>\nhow their moods run. And if the pattern that you see now persists, maybe see if <br/>\n<br/>\non the days when they are eating more of the yellow twisties side of the options <br/>\n<br/>\nset, if they are more tired and more in need of quick energy. Or if you are less <br/>\n<br/>\navailable to them or out more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFood allergies and intolerances are apparently quite rare but the perception is <br/>\n<br/>\nthat they are quite common. According to wikipedia <br/>\n<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_intolerance)\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_intolerance)</a>: &quot;Estimates of the prevalence of <br/>\n<br/>\nfood intolerance vary widely from 2% to over 20% of the population.So far only <br/>\n<br/>\nthree prevalence studies in Dutch and English adults have  been based on <br/>\n<br/>\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges.

If you have a prediction that certain foods will cause certain <br/>\nkinds of behaviour it is much more likely to come true than if you don&#39;t start <br/>\nwith that bias. That&#39;s why so much testing of pharmaceuticals is done with <br/>\ndouble blind, randomised trials. There is some hope that the bias that the <br/>\nhumans bring to bear on the study will have less of an effect. And even with <br/>\nthat, it is still hard to tease bias from real response to treatment. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen David and I stepped away from limiting what foods Simon and Linnaea ate and <br/>\nstepped into helping to get them what they wanted to eat plus the things we <br/>\nthought they would enjoy eating it wasn&#39;t hands off. If I noticed Linnaea going <br/>\nand getting bag after bag of Wotsits (similar to twisties or cheese puffs in the <br/>\nU.S.) I would put together a platter of some other options for her, or ask if <br/>\nshe was hungry for something other than wotsits and needed me to get it. When <br/>\nthey were littler they ate smaller amounts at more frequent intervals, they got <br/>\nhungry more often. So keeping easy to put together options to hand made it much <br/>\neasier for me to give them more choices. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra has kept something I wrote from ages ago that has a list of some of the <br/>\noptions available in our home: &quot;There is free access to food in our house.  <br/>\nThere are two bowlfuls of starburst fruit chews on the kitchen table and carrots <br/>\nand celery cut up and floating in water in the fridge as per my Grandmother; <br/>\nthere are packets of crisps in the cupboard with weetabix cereal and muesli <br/>\ncereal and whatever other kind of cereal; there is dried squid and sheets of <br/>\nnori and crackers and peanut butter and chocolate chip oatmeal cookies and ice <br/>\ncream and, and, and…  All things get eaten.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe all things get eaten line, that wasn&#39;t true. I&#39;ve thrown out a lot of <br/>\nstarburst fruit chews, &#39;cause they get melty. And I used carrots from a bowl of <br/>\nwater in the fridge the other day in stock because the carrots are a little too <br/>\nsweet for Simon&#39;s or Linnaea&#39;s current preferences. Ice cream sits in the <br/>\nfreezer for an age. At the moment crisps are having a bit of a revival. But they <br/>\noften wait for some friend of Simon or Linnaea to come over and eat them. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBalance doesn&#39;t happen every day, either. Whenever I&#39;d get nervous about what I <br/>\nfelt was an unbalanced diet from Simon or Linnaea I&#39;d keep notes. A day might be <br/>\ntoo short to see the true picture. One day might have three donuts in it, but <br/>\ntwo days might have three donuts in it, bagels, burritos, carrots, celery, <br/>\napples, and three days might have three donuts, bagels, carrots, celery, apples, <br/>\nstrawberries, potatoes, wotsits, burritos, weetabix, hummus, bread and butter, <br/>\nramen and on and on. A moment of dietary preference doesn&#39;t make up a diet, it&#39;s <br/>\njust that moment. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if what you are seeing is a kind of creeping yellow peril in a bowl of <br/>\nyellow twisties than they will be writ large on your children&#39;s experience, for <br/>\nyou. If you see this extruded snack food as filled with potential for anger and <br/>\nhostilities and unhappiness it will be hard for it to just be a moment of <br/>\ndietary preference in your children&#39;s day. It will have a huge rippling effect. <br/>\nIf they&#39;d had homemade bread and butter and an apple and had a hostile moment <br/>\nafterwards I assume that the food would have had no bearing on the anger? It may <br/>\nbe worth examining your causal links in your head. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, if you are making a list of what they eat, you could add in a list of <br/>\nhow their moods run. And if the pattern that you see now persists, maybe see if <br/>\non the days when they are eating more of the yellow twisties side of the options <br/>\nset, if they are more tired and more in need of quick energy. Or if you are less <br/>\navailable to them or out more.<br/>\n<br/>\n Food allergies and intolerances are apparently quite rare but the perception is <br/>\nthat they are quite common.

For intolerance to food <br/>\nadditives the prevalence varied between  0.01 to 0.23%.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really struggling with some aspects of unschooling food & wanted to hear <br/>\nsome thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy girls have absolute self-regulation when it comes to times they eat & amount <br/>\nas well as being able to choose &quot;non traditional&quot; choices like cereal for dinner <br/>\netc but it feels very counter intuitive to purchase or not intervene when it <br/>\ncomes to very artificial foods and lots of colours & preservatives.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like I&#39;m asking more than they are capable of self-regulating, that these <br/>\n&quot;foods&quot; are designed to be addictive & very very appealing through packaging <br/>\netc. Also I can&#39;t deny the effect some of these additives have on my kids! <br/>\nTantrums, tears and even nightmares-especially with Willow, she seems very <br/>\nsensitive to colours & preservatives.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand I really understand that by making these foods forbidden they <br/>\nwill be more exciting & more likely to be gorged on when oppertunity arises.

You are *sure* there are no other reasons for those behaviors, such as being tired or needing food or any of the other reasons that can bring forth unhappines within a person?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===these &quot;foods&quot; are designed to be addictive & very very appealing through packaging etc===<br/>\n<br/>\nI disagree with the &quot;addictive&quot; part, but I do agree that ALL foods are designed to be appealing. <br/>\n<br/>\nApple growers certainly hope that their apples appeal to us enough that we want to buy more!! <br/>\n<br/>\nThe produce department of our local grocery store is THE MOST appealing part of the store, visually. Not just to me, but to my son, as well -- a kid who loves potato chips and soda, but who, when grocery shopping with me, will choose way more produce *because of* it&#39;s visual appeal than he will potato chips or soda.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does a disservice to your children to assume they don&#39;t, or won&#39;t, pick up on the fact that processed foods are packaged to be visually appealing so that you&#39;ll buy them. My son&#39;s chosen packaged foods because of the packaging and has had his share of &quot;blah&quot;- or &quot;yuck&quot;-flavored foods, and he doesn&#39;t ask for those again. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===Also I can&#39;t deny the effect some of these additives have on my kids!===<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you or any of your children have intolerances or allergies to &quot;whole&quot; foods? To any fruits or legumes or nuts or dairy or grains?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf so, do you view those intolerances or allergies in the same negative way you view food coloring and preservatives?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===It doesn&#39;t feel comfortable to restrict their food choices but it doesn&#39;t feel comfortable to watch my kids eat bright yellow twisties either-nor to watch the aggression that often follows.===<br/>\n<br/>\nWork towards balance.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son and I both are aware that if we eat sweets / sugary foods on an empty stomach without having a bit of protein beforehand, we will feel shakey and cranky and will be prone to easy frustration and tears. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf we don&#39;t want to have a meal but we want something sweet and haven&#39;t eaten in several hours, we&#39;ll have some string cheese and pretzels before the sweet stuff or with the sweet stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son knows that I&#39;ll say &quot;yes&quot; or some form of &quot;yes&quot; about sweets. But that&#39;s not the same as dumping a boatload of candy in his lap. Sometimes he&#39;ll ask to have a Coca-Cola or chocolate late at night. Since we don&#39;t often have caffeine we&#39;re both sensitive to it, and a glass of caffeinated soda or a chocolate bar 6 or 8 hours before bedtime will result in bedtime not happening when it normally does. In those instances, I&#39;ll often suggest a non-caffeinated soda or a different kind of sweet and let him know that I&#39;ll remind him about the Coca-Cola or chocolate early in the day the next day. And I make a point to do so! <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re absolutely sure it&#39;s the artificial coloring and preservatives that are causing the tears and unhappiness, find alternatives to those things. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you&#39;re not absolutely sure it&#39;s the coloring and preservatives, I encourage you to step back from that assumption and your negative feelings about those things. Because if what you&#39;ve expressed here about them is expressed even a wee bit in your household, your kids will have picked up on your feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Feeling conflicted about food","postDate":"1296449331","msgId":59321,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc5NkYwMjk0LTJFRTEtNDAyRC1BNjIxLTlFNzE1RDUxOTRCMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDY0OTUxNC43Njk4NC5xbUB3ZWIxMTQ2MTcubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDY0OTUxNC43Njk4NC5xbUB3ZWIxMTQ2MTcubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":59320,"nextInTopic":59324,"prevInTime":59320,"nextInTime":59322,"topicId":59320,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Others will have other ideas, but of all the post what I think would help is if you would think of what your girls have, and what you have in deciding how to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-370691170\">Others will have other ideas, but of all the post what I think would help is if you would think of what your girls have, and what you have in deciding how to proceed, is choices.
