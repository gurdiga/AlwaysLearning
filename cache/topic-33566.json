We used to HOMESCHOOL.  He chose school for <br/>\nmore social activity--in retrospect, I did allow the birth of 2 <br/>\nother children and the nursing and needs of these children to leave <br/>\nme not making the same outgoing efforts to find the excessive social <br/>\noutings he craved.  That said, school has been very stressful for <br/>\nhim.  The homework seems to have been the straw that broke his back, <br/>\nas it came to such a head this year, we finally sat last week and <br/>\ndecided enough is enough--get out before it kills you (and uS!!:))<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSawyer has been kind of angry, not wanting to interact with his 8 <br/>\nand 5 year old brothers and has been downright hostile and nasty <br/>\ntoward them with no provacation, not really wanting to hang out with <br/>\nus, not wanting to talk nicely, nor be compliant with any part of <br/>\nthe &quot;family&quot; doings.  (Like if we planned an outing to the beach, <br/>\nwhich we ALL love, he would turn it into a nightmare).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, he has only been out of school 1 full week, but holy cow!  He <br/>\nis hugging us--smiling, playing with his brothers, hanging out in <br/>\nthe kitchen, asking questions, went to the LIBRARY with me--wants to <br/>\ncook every Wednesday night....is answering nicely, asking nicely, <br/>\nlooks different altogether--body posture etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been astounded, and now have to say that by Golly--it is the <br/>\nstress that caused a lot of that previous behavior.  It had nothing <br/>\nto do with being 12-13.  It wasn&#39;t some other excuse about too much <br/>\nfood, too little, too little sleep..too many WOW hours......all the <br/>\nthings I kept looking for and trying to help him out with .<br/>\n<br/>\nHe wants to continue with some kind of &quot;school&quot; work, which we&#39;re <br/>\ndiscussing, but I have just kind of tossed it in his lap as to WHAT, <br/>\nand then am helping him find the info.  MY point--not to digress- is <br/>\nthat the effects of stress are far beyond what I already knew.  The <br/>\ntransformation of this child--what occurred in the beginning of him <br/>\ngoing to school--though very slowly and not as noticable to link---<br/>\nto the stripping of this shell of resistance to all things good--is <br/>\nremarkable.  And of course makes me sad that I waited and didn&#39;t <br/>\npull him out earlier--but that was not HIS choice at the time.  We <br/>\njust kept talking about the pros and cons, and I pointed out the <br/>\ndetriments as I saw them, and kept asking him to consider all things <br/>\nwith his life choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, my efforts will be 110% for finding him what HE needs now.  <br/>\nAnd there will BE NO MORE HOMESCHOOLING IN THIS HOUSE!!!!!!!!!!!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33480,"nextTopicId":33419}}
