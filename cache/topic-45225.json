Sometimes rec districts will offer very casual summer classes (our local dance studio does this as well) which are shorter in duration and very low key.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough I am suggesting it I must explain; I put my dd in one of those classes when she was about 3 (she wanted to to ballet classes)and she didn&#39;t like it at all -- she said she &quot;felt squished.&quot;  She wanted to be able to dance her own way and not follow directions, doing only certain moves.  So she has spent the last 3.5 years having a great time just dancing and choreographing routines at home and with her friends.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOnly this last fall did she decide that she wanted to try a ballet/jazz class again, and this time she loved it.  Now she is doing a hiphop class and has requested private lessons with the instructor.  Finding a less formal way for your dd to try ballet classes might allow her to see what it is really about.  Maybe there are a some dance studios in your area that will allow you to try a couple of classes for free.  That would satisfy your dd&#39;s curiosity and keep you from putting a lot of money into classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as movie suggestions, my DD always loves the Angelina Ballerina dvds.  They have a little bit with real girls dancing in between the stories.  There are lots of Barbie movies and all have dancing and my daughter still loves these, some based on actual ballets (Nutcracker, Swan Lake).  And then there are Cirque du Soleil dvds, not all dance, but include some amazing movement to music which have inspired weeks worth of play at our house.  And how about finding some of the truly amazing dance videos on youtube and watching those?  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are loads of great children&#39;s books about dancing and ballerinas, check your local library for both dvds and books.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and we have the Angelina Ballerina board game ... as you play the game you have to do ballet moves.  I wonder if there are any other dancing games out there?  I know there are kids&#39; yoga games, so I would think there could be more dancing games as well.  She is too young for Dance Dance Revolution just yet, but we have both the Wii and GC versions and they are a blast, great for playing and dancing with your child. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am going to mostly just agree with Tom and everyone else who suggested putting on music and costumes and dancing with your daughter.  I dance all the time with my kids, we move the furniture to clear a space and just move ... not so much ballet anymore, hiphop is more the style of late (Planet B-Boy documentary and Step Up 2 The Streets being the main sources of inspiration).  In fact, dancing with my children inspired me to revisit my love of modern dance and enroll in classes for myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun dancing!  <br/>\nCathy<br/>\n<br/>\nPS I don&#39;t know if they do community dances anywhere near you, like beginning square dances or contra dances, but my kids have always loved going to those.  If it is a dance that is for beginners, they are often very accomodating to very young dancers.  My dd has been dancing at these since she was 3 or 4 (and I danced with my youngest in a sling until he was 3).</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny C","from":"&quot;Jenny C&quot; &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Suggestions for a 3yo who loves to dance","postDate":"1242760120","msgId":45312,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGd1djAzbyttOThlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGd1c2FkZCtwb2pvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":45302,"nextInTopic":45317,"prevInTime":45311,"nextInTime":45313,"topicId":45225,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ideas for you.

These include all kinds of dance - jazz, tap, ballet, <br/>\nhip-hop, latin, modern, etc. They are in full costume, etc. Usually they <br/>\nare way too long for a 3 year old - but you could sit on an aisle and go <br/>\nin and out - not sit for 3 hours (yes, that&#39;s how long they are, <br/>\nsometimes).<br/>\n<br/>\nI really like your idea of giving her the costumes and props. You could <br/>\ninclude tap shoes and a big piece of linoleum to tap dance on, too. <br/>\nPayless Shoes has small child size ballet and tap shoes very inexpensive <br/>\n- real ones. Dance stores are very expensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids like a little &quot;stage&quot; to perform on --- we had one in our back <br/>\nyard for a long time. It was a large piece of plywood set up on bricks - <br/>\nonly one-brick high - but enough to feel like it was special to be <br/>\ndancing or acting up on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere I live, we have dance and musical theater performances that are <br/>\naimed at children. You could look around for those - look at the <br/>\nwebsites of any venues you have nearby. Again, don&#39;t forget colleges - <br/>\nthey often have a series of performances for children on Saturday <br/>\nafternoons. And, look at big impressive venues - we&#39;ve gone to the <br/>\nHollywood Bowl for children&#39;s performances that were free, even.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t look for instructional dance videos, by the way, but I&#39;d look <br/>\nfor really fun musical theater that has great dancing in it. Also, look <br/>\nfor episodes of Sesame Street with tap dancer Savion Glover. There is a <br/>\nSesame Street DVD called &quot;Get Up and Dance&quot; which is wonderful!<br/>\n<br/>\nAh - and get the video of CATS, the Musical. My dancing kids wore out <br/>\nour vhs tape of CATS (pre-DVD&#39;s) and we went and saw it live about 12 <br/>\ntimes, too. Each cat is a personality and they do all different kinds of <br/>\ndance, including ballet. Be ready to help make Cats costumes and do cats <br/>\nmake-up and get the cd, too, so she can dance to that music.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":98618240,"authorName":"Renee M","from":"Renee M &lt;reneem29@...&gt;","profile":"reneem29","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Suggestions for a 3yo who loves to dance","postDate":"1242661874","msgId":45238,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDczMTE3LjkwMDIyLnFtQHdlYjUzMzAzLm1haWwucmUyLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGd1cTdlcitrYXY3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGd1cTdlcitrYXY3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":45236,"nextInTopic":45239,"prevInTime":45237,"nextInTime":45239,"topicId":45225,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"At that age onward, my daughter has loved The Nutcracker.  We have multiple DVDs of different companies performing it.  Her favorite is George Balanchine s","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-28358397\">At that age onward, my daughter has loved The Nutcracker.  We have multiple DVDs of different companies performing it.  Her favorite is George Balanchine&#39;s The Nutcracker because the leads are kids.  She picked out a nutcracker doll at Michael&#39;s this year and she and her brother have spent countless hours re-enacting scenes from the ballet and dancing along with the DVD.  We took her to the actual ballet last Christmas to see it in person and she was utterly mesmerized.<br/>\n <br/>\nAlso, the book Lili at Ballet by Rachel Isadora was a big hit with my daughter at age 3.5.  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":81228470,"authorName":"krissy8444","from":"&quot;krissy8444&quot; &lt;Chris@...&gt;","profile":"krissy8444","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Suggestions for a 3yo who loves to dance","postDate":"1242660548","msgId":45236,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGd1cnVzNCtuc3RrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGd1cTdlcitrYXY3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":45233,"nextInTopic":45238,"prevInTime":45235,"nextInTime":45237,"topicId":45225,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Is there a reason you re not sure the ballet class would be for her?

At the moment she&#39;s really into ballet.  She has talked about having ballet lessons one day, but right now I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s the best thing for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was all sparked by a DVD she owns, Barbie in The 12 Dancing Princesses.  We watch the movie often, and one of her favourite parts is the special features section.  It shows a bit about how the dance moves were choreographed, and shows the real dancer talking about her day and life as a dancer.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend who is a dancer has been to our house a few times to do some ballet with Caitlyn, which she enjoyed immensely.  My friend also let Caitlyn try on her pointe shoes which was wonderful!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have some beautiful classical music CD&#39;s which she loves to dance to.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister just gave her a pair of shoes that look a little like ballet slippers.  Caitlyn likes wearing them, but she wants a real pair of pointe shoes too!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was hoping someone else might have some ideas of how to continue to encourage this love of ballet (and all dancing), without having to jump straight into formal lessons.  Any other dancing movies we could watch?  I was thinking of getting Centre Stage for her, just for the dance scenes.  Any other ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nI was also thinking of making her a tutu and buying a leotard or a swimming costume, to complete her outfit.  Maybe add some ribbon to her slippers so they are more like pointe shoes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also thought I could get a couple of other little girls together in their dancing clothes, put on some music and just see what happens.  Not a class as such, just a way to get that class environment for her, without the structure that a formal class would impose.<br/>\n<br/>\nWow, I had more ideas than I thought.  But I&#39;m sure there&#39;s still more I could do.<br/>\n<br/>\nTammy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45320,"nextTopicId":45311}}
