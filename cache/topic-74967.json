There might be the ghost of that in you—voices saying “they need to learn to do that without you.”  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey WILL learn it, and can learn it without damage. :-)  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband’s spelling continued to improve when he was in his 20’s and 30’s, because he wrote letters to me when we were living in different towns, and event announcements for a club we were in, and because of programming and needing to be more precise.  His spelling is great now, but it didn’t quickly in his youth, and he balked at schoolishness sometimes (being one of the mathish lefthanded type, another indication sometimes that spelling bees aren’t likely to be a hobby of choice).   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he and I were young in our 20’s, we made a deal that if I asked a math question he would just answer it without pressure, teasing or any lesson, and if he had a spelling question, I would just answer it.   As the years passed, his spelling got better, and I got better at quick calculations than he was.  Still, if it’s ratios or interest or odds, he’s the source.  If it’s plain arithmetic or plane geometry, I’m quicker because I just do it without thinking which type of formula might be needed.   When he needed help making a star on cloth, with a compass and protractor, I reminded him how very quickly and he did it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat early agreement not to tease or shame made our partnership better before we ever had children, and so we extended that same courtesy to them—all they needed to do was ask.    It helped with unschooling before we even knew we would have a baby.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: ways to help with spelling","postDate":"1414225791","msgId":74981,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIyOUNEN0UyLTIyNTAtNDg3Ny1BQ0JCLUVGRjNBQ0MwODhFOEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBQVRaUDZ6cTA1aUVqay1ncEpPLTNPejhaREJVM0RiZ2JPX09kOGkxQUdHdHJxK2dBQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBQVRaUDZ6cTA1aUVqay1ncEpPLTNPejhaREJVM0RiZ2JPX09kOGkxQUdHdHJxK2dBQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":74980,"nextInTopic":74982,"prevInTime":74980,"nextInTime":74982,"topicId":74967,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Have you heard of Gary Chapman s 5 love languages.
