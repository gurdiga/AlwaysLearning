I&#39;m<br/>\ngoing to search out the Video Game Revolution and pick<br/>\nup a copy of &quot;The Unprocessed Child&quot; asap. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it *is* the fact that we&#39;re living here with<br/>\nthe grandparents that&#39;s getting to dh. I&#39;ve been<br/>\nnoticing these patterns of when he gets &quot;test-ish&quot; and<br/>\nit seems that he gets that way after spending a few<br/>\nhours with the grandmother. He&#39;s recently told me that<br/>\nboth she and the grandfather have told him that our<br/>\nson needs to be in public school b/c &quot;it was good<br/>\nenough&quot; for their sons. Dh, quite respectfully, has<br/>\ntold them that ds is *our* son and we&#39;re doing what&#39;s<br/>\nright for him and for us. But then, usually the day<br/>\nafter spending a few hours with her, James<br/>\n(husband--it&#39;s kind of awkward for me to use &quot;dh&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;ds&quot;) asks the test-like questions.... So I&#39;m thinking<br/>\nthat once we move that stress will be alleviated.<br/>\n(BTW, the inlaws have *never* told me that John should<br/>\ngo back to ps. He was in ps from 1st & 2nd grades. I<br/>\njust hear about it from James. Also, my sister<br/>\nrecently told me that my own mother & brother were<br/>\ntalking about how John should be back in school. They<br/>\nhaven&#39;t told me anything, either. Hmmmm.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn an aside, I mentioned that James &quot;respectfully&quot;<br/>\ntold his grandparents etc.. James was raised in the<br/>\ndeep south (Louisiana) and I noticed that while we&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen here (Louisiana) he&#39;s taken more to saying &quot;yes,<br/>\nma&#39;am/no ma&#39;am&quot; and &quot;yes sir/no sir.&quot; What&#39;s<br/>\ninteresting, too, is that his family members (and at<br/>\ntimes him, too) insist that John (son) uses &quot;yes<br/>\nma&#39;am&quot; etc. John isn&#39;t rude; he does say &quot;yes/no,<br/>\nplease, thank you&quot; but we&#39;ve never stressed the<br/>\n&quot;ma&#39;am/sir&quot; part. (Heck, I don&#39;t use those terms.)<br/>\nJames and I were watching the Queens of Comedy the<br/>\nother night, and one of the comedienne&#39;s mentioned<br/>\nthat when somebody tells you what and how you should<br/>\ntalk, it&#39;s all about control. That person is trying to<br/>\ncontrol you. Since then, James hasn&#39;t insisted John<br/>\nuse &quot;ma&#39;am/sir&quot; when he responds. Interesting, huh?<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, thank you all so much for your insight and<br/>\nwords of wisdom. I&#39;m going to get the Video Game<br/>\nRevolution DVD and watch it with the guys one evening.<br/>\nNot going to say anthing &quot;lecturish&quot; or otherwise over<br/>\nthe top--just watch and enjoy.

I find that<br/>\nI tend to get defensive, as if James is somehow<br/>\nquestioning *my* relationship with learning. And I&#39;m<br/>\nnow realizing that my defensiveness can be part and<br/>\nparcel of living with the inlaws, too. I don&#39;t believe<br/>\nthey&#39;re exactly thrilled with the idea that I<br/>\nwillingly left grad school when I was thisclose to<br/>\ngetting the PhD just b/c I realized (a long time<br/>\ncoming, though) that higher ed (even a PhD program),<br/>\nincluding teaching and attending university, is the<br/>\nantithesis of education and learning. I think they&#39;re<br/>\nhaving a hard time trying to figure out where I&#39;m<br/>\ncoming from. At any rate, I find myself feeling<br/>\nchallenged when I talk to James about unschooling<br/>\n*only* during or after he&#39;s quizzed John or asked me<br/>\nwhat has John done &quot;for school&quot; that day. I&#39;ll check<br/>\nout some links on Sandra&#39;s website re: testing, and<br/>\nI&#39;m going to email James the links to the Unschooling<br/>\nDads groups. I think he could benefit from them--just<br/>\nknowing that there are other unschooling dads out<br/>\nthere might help him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess b/c it&#39;s all relatively new to me--not the<br/>\nidea of unschooling but our active practicing it--that<br/>\nI may be having a hard time sharing it with my<br/>\nhusband.

Now, instead of<br/>\nlarge volumes, I forward the occasional pithy email, or link to a new<br/>\narticle (rather than the whole site for example). The other thing I did that<br/>\nhas made a lot of difference is forward some of *my* posts to him,<br/>\nespecially those that are &quot;theoretical musings&quot;, along with any answers they<br/>\ngenerate, so that he gets some understanding of where my thinking is going.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be better to help your dh see what he is doing as being &quot;testing<br/>\nand quizzing&quot;, and offer him the information that it is the testing itself<br/>\nthat is anathema to free learning. I&#39;m trying to suggest that focusing on<br/>\ndh&#39;s *actions* (that he can change at once) will immediately put less<br/>\npressure on your son, rather than expecting dh to prematurely embrace these<br/>\nlarger concepts that &quot;every activity is valid learning&quot; or &quot;learning should<br/>\nbe fun&quot;. As Unschoolers we know these things are true, however I believe<br/>\nthat your dh&#39;s actions of asking judgmental questions should be ceased<br/>\nbefore his acceptance can blossom. I have faith that it will blossom. I&#39;m<br/>\nsure that there are some links to anti-testing info websites on Sandra&#39;s<br/>\nsite.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for family members:<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that helped with my mother (who died in January) was to send her<br/>\narticles from sources that *she* respected. The example that I always repeat<br/>\nis when she was being ignorantly opinionated about extended breastfeeding, I<br/>\nsent her an article from the American Academy of Pediatrics, rather than one<br/>\nfrom say, Mothering Magazine, because she was married to a doctor and had a<br/>\ngreat deal of faith in Western medicine. The information was essentially the<br/>\nsame, and it quieted her fears - and she even told me &quot;OK, you know best&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also was able to avoid getting into lengthy discussions by immediately<br/>\nhanging up the phone since we lived in different states. &quot;Jayn should be<br/>\nwriting her name by now&quot;..&quot;No she shouldn&#39;t gotta go bye now love you&quot;<br/>\nClick. This worked because my mother was a very long winded person and<br/>\nletting her get started tended to lead to &quot;and another thing (you do wrong<br/>\nis)....&quot; too often. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like eventually most people have to find a way to tell their<br/>\ninflexible or willfully ignorant relatives effectively to &quot;butt out&quot;. It is<br/>\npossible to do this kindly and nicely, acknowledging the affection that<br/>\nprompts the concern. However sometimes it has to come down to an ultimatum:<br/>\n&quot;WE are our children&#39;s parents and we have to do what we feel is best. If<br/>\nyou want to be part of their lives you will have to accept that this is our<br/>\ndecision.&quot; Sometimes they just don&#39;t get to be alone with the kids.<br/>\nSometimes there is a lot of discussion between the kids and parents about<br/>\nthe differences in attitude at Grandma&#39;s and whether it is still worth<br/>\nvisiting. Sometimes Grandma or Uncle merely get a card for the holidays and<br/>\nlittle other contact. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

At least I have offered information.  And the reading my<br/>\ndh has done has been good for all of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nHang in there!

Well, almost all of us. Here&#39;s<br/>\nthe thing. My husband fully supports us, is very<br/>\ninvolved with ds&#39;s learning, activities, etc., *but*<br/>\nhe&#39;s still in the mindset of school in that he&#39;s<br/>\nhaving a hard time seeing that what our son&#39;s doing is<br/>\nwhat&#39;s right for him at that moment. Ds John is a<br/>\nvideo gamer and computer whiz. He likes to spend hours<br/>\nplaying & studying games, their designs, logic,<br/>\nartwork, music, etc. He&#39;s also creating his own pc<br/>\ngame. Dh James is another computer/video gamer so he<br/>\ncan spend hours doing the same thing ds does. *But* it<br/>\nseems as if dh doesn&#39;t consider what ds is doing as<br/>\nvalid learning. (Dh regards his time doing this as<br/>\n&quot;relaxing&quot; and having fun, so it seems that he&#39;s still<br/>\nhaving trouble recognizing that we *can* have fun and<br/>\nlearn at the same time...) <br/>\n<br/>\nOccasionally dh will ask ds what he did for math that<br/>\nday, or what he did for writing, etc. And when he<br/>\ndoes, I can see ds clam up and become sullen. He&#39;ll<br/>\nnot tell his dad that he wrote this incredible poem<br/>\njust because &quot;it needed to come out&quot; or about a really<br/>\ngreat conversation we had or that he&#39;s composing his<br/>\nown drum solo or ... you get the idea. Ds does this<br/>\nonly when dh starts to get, what I call, &quot;lecturish.&quot;<br/>\nWhen the two are just hanging out and having fun, ds<br/>\nis completely open with dh, talking about a whole host<br/>\nof things.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also doesn&#39;t help any that right now we&#39;re staying<br/>\nat dh&#39;s grandparents&#39; house and it&#39;s becoming more<br/>\nobvious that they are anti-hsing at worst and, at<br/>\nbest, think we should follow a set curriculum that&#39;s<br/>\nput forth by the state and &quot;do school&quot; only during<br/>\n&quot;normal school hours&quot; (their words). The grandmother<br/>\nlikes to brag about what one of the other<br/>\ngreat-grandkids is doing in school (taking sax<br/>\nlessons) while not commenting on the fact that ds is<br/>\nlearning drums, violin, is a great storyteller, can<br/>\nunderstand complex & abstract concepts, conversations,<br/>\nloves satire, etc. (He&#39;s only 11, too.) Ds can have<br/>\nmeaningful or goofy conversations with *anybody* while<br/>\nthe other ps kids in the family can barely hold a<br/>\nthought. The grandmother has even noticed this and,<br/>\nI&#39;m not kidding, ask why ds doesn&#39;t have any trouble<br/>\ntalking to anybody but (insert other kid&#39;s name here)<br/>\nis &quot;out of his league.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, we *are* moving to our own house next month<br/>\n(in another state, too! LOL), so that&#39;s a light at the<br/>\nend of the tunnel, but I&#39;m still at a loss as how to<br/>\nhelp dh alleviate his own fears and come to really<br/>\nrecognize that what ds is doing is incredible, he&#39;s<br/>\ngenuinely happy, and he&#39;s nurturing an amazing<br/>\npersonality, sense of humor, and a centeredness being<br/>\nas a person.<br/>\n<br/>\nSigh. Any suggestions are welcome. I&#39;m just getting<br/>\nvery tired feeling like I need to act as a buffer btw<br/>\nour growing unschooling lifestyle and Dh&#39;s slight<br/>\nresistance. I think he&#39;s giving it a try b/c he trusts<br/>\nme, but I&#39;m not so sure he trusts ds enough to back<br/>\noff and just let ds *be.* Does any of this make sense?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, ideas, thoughts, comments, etc are welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nLisette<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Short of standing over him to make sure he reads<br/>\nthese columns, I have sent him links to various<br/>\nunschooling columns, particularly those by Sandra<br/>\nDodd.
