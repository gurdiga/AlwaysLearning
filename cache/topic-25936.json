I mean like pretty much<br/>\nthe whole day in some way or other.  It costs a lot of money, but we<br/>\nmanage somehow.  One thing that helps is that my older daughter helps<br/>\nteach the younger classes and gets tuition breaks. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I was telling my husband the other day some of the value we<br/>\nare getting for our money.... (he sometimes needs reminding when I<br/>\nsend away for yet another pair of pointe shoes.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth girls know a lot about classical music now. <br/>\nThey read ballet stories and ballet dancer biographies and ballet<br/>\nmagazines. <br/>\nThey have developed an interest in other dance forms.  <br/>\nThey have learned about their bodies and how they work. <br/>\nThey have learned about nutrition. <br/>\nThey are in great physical shape and are comfortable with their bodies. <br/>\nThey have learned choreography.<br/>\nThey have learned theater and acting skills.  <br/>\nMy oldest daughter has begun to make costume pieces and has found that<br/>\nshe has a flare for it. <br/>\nThey have learned teaching skills. <br/>\nThey have made life-long friends and worked through difficulties in<br/>\ngroups.<br/>\nMy oldest daughter has had public speaking experiences.  <br/>\nBoth now have an interest in the French language and are studying it. <br/>\nThey have interest in history of dance.  <br/>\nMy oldest daughter is learning to make a website for her ballet company.  <br/>\nThey have learned how to purchase ballet supplies and how to use funds<br/>\nwisely.  <br/>\nI also volunteer a lot and have made friends in that way too. <br/>\nWe have met some really interesting, talented, and artistic people.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI would say it is worth it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMary Beth</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25926,"nextTopicId":25949}}
