Like someone<br/>\nelse mentioned, take what resonates and begin in small practical ways to<br/>\nunschool. If you&#39;re like most people, that will be encouraging and it will<br/>\nraise more questions too. I read extensively for years because I started<br/>\nlooking into unschooling ideas at the same time I came across other<br/>\nparenting philosophies when Karl wasn&#39;t even 1 year old and I had some<br/>\nluxury of time until he would have been &quot;school age.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI quickly became passionate about the idea enough to really delve much much<br/>\nmore into the writings, purchased some of Holt&#39;s books eventually, as well<br/>\nas books by other unschoolers such as Peggy Pirro and Rue Kream. I think<br/>\nyou&#39;re lucky because here you are and Sandra Dodd&#39;s writings and website<br/>\ncontent by other authors is now available in book form... an incredible<br/>\nresource! It just keeps getting easier and easier as the years go by to get<br/>\ninformed and to research and follow up on information.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I came at unschooling by reading voraciously on the subject and trying it<br/>\nout in my own home without really knowing that many unschoolers in real<br/>\nlife, only having occasionally met a few here and there. Do try unschooling<br/>\nat home (and wherever you and your child/ren may roam in the big wide world<br/>\n;)! Certainly feel free! Don&#39;t wait around. Start as soon as you can, and<br/>\nthat by itself will (more than likely) build in you lots of confidence and<br/>\nplenty of steam for unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s missing really is not infinite.

I remember feeling bewildered....just <br/>\nplain bewildered. I was reading things by Sandra and by others and they <br/>\nwere really obviously very intelligent women, but some of the things <br/>\nthey said seemed just so completely and totally unrealistic.

Think about them. Think about whether they make sense <br/>\nTO YOU for your own family. You are not joining a club or sorority and <br/>\nyou don&#39;t need to be accepted. No rush week.

I read<br/>\n&gt; the various threads, opinions of different people. I found two aspects<br/>\n&gt; intriguing - the need and the risks, which seem to be exclusive stances<br/>\n&gt; taken by members.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There seems to be a need among some members to find &quot;softer guidance&quot;, which<br/>\n&gt; is *not* the same as not working on themselves. I understand this to mean<br/>\n&gt; that they would like acknowledgment of what is and where they need to go<br/>\n&gt; more than &#39;troubleshooting&#39;. It is obviously not impossible, if we look at<br/>\n&gt; many transformative methodologies. It is possible to focus on desired change<br/>\n&gt; to create it. We find what we seek, and seeking problems with what is<br/>\n&gt; happening quickly leads newcomers into insecure terrain, while experienced<br/>\n&gt; members cope fluidly based on their understanding of the method. Some<br/>\n&gt; withdraw, others challenge, still others form breakaway groups, but the need<br/>\n&gt; underlying them is the same - finding understanding (as distinct from hand<br/>\n&gt; holding and mollycoddling) in a way that they feel understood. Experienced<br/>\n&gt; members often understand. Sometimes better than the person with the issue,<br/>\n&gt; but it feels judgmental, since we are not at an experience level to &#39;get<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;. I had a great deal of trouble with this initially (not that I promise<br/>\n&gt; its over, but...).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On the other hand, a separate list seems risky terrain too. It would be too<br/>\n&gt; easy for a bunch of new comers (including me) to pat each other on the back<br/>\n&gt; and go &quot;there, there, its all right...&quot;. It is easy to blur the lines<br/>\n&gt; between acceptance of a person and compromising goals. Even this quote of<br/>\n&gt; mine could be either, depending on context.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was wondering if mentoring could fill the need and reduce risks of<br/>\n&gt; &quot;slipping into complacency&quot;. If newbies finding it difficult to cope could<br/>\n&gt; find experienced mentors of &quot;their favorite input flavor&quot;, they would slowly<br/>\n&gt; learn to find that &quot;gentleness&quot; in the list itself in the caring; without<br/>\n&gt; needing to withdraw or find alternate resources of dubious value.<br/>\n&gt; Versatility is a strength in a guide. A list like this is a tremendous<br/>\n&gt; source for finding it, which a new list could not be. Could we leverage it<br/>\n&gt; to everyone&#39;s happiness?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Has something like this been tried by unschoolers rather than the risk of<br/>\n&gt; breakaway kindergarten lists people never graduate from? &lt;-- I got this<br/>\n&gt; concern from something Sandra wrote<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;...people stay on bad trails instead of getting onto good ones. And the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stronger responses were coming from mothers with less experience. Same<br/>\n&gt; &gt; emotional experience, less practical benefit....&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It is a difficult place for a newbie. Either shut up and cope with something<br/>\n&gt; that is not helping you because it is on another level, or withdraw and go<br/>\n&gt; elsewhere and risk derailing your entire purpose for getting into all this.<br/>\n&gt; A mentor could help get over &quot;stucks&quot; and defensive anger and misunderstood<br/>\n&gt; intentions and understand the underlying processes helping people cope<br/>\n&gt; better and quicker and learn all through rather than be silenced to some<br/>\n&gt; back shelf and looked at later if they survive.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am not questioning how things are done, just looking at possibilities that<br/>\n&gt; may exist for damage control of newbie acclimatization for the hundreds in<br/>\n&gt; here that keep going through it all the time new people join and also the<br/>\n&gt; newbies themselves who find it difficult to find value when they are so busy<br/>\n&gt; defending themselves difficult to take expressions.

The ideas that seemed crazy the first time they came up made more sense the second time.  If I wanted more answers in the meantime, I checked the archives and if that did not work, I asked.

Staying on topic and not seconding posts is important to me.  When I have little time to read, I might delete most of the posts in my inbox without reading.

This is such a gift and such a perspective changing thing for me, the idea of telling the people who make this possible how to best accomodate me, well it seems the epitome of ungrateful. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":288405080,"authorName":"diana jenner","from":"diana jenner &lt;hahamommy@...&gt;","profile":"dianajenner","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Mentoring?","postDate":"1265639101","msgId":50549,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY1MThhOTM2MTAwMjA4MDYyNXE0Yjg0ZGIyNG8xZjQ4OTFiMDU4Y2FkNDZmQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY1MThhOTM2MTAwMjA4MDU0N3kyODQ3MzJjZm42ZDY0MTQ5ODkwNWQ3Y2QxQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDc5YzFkMWI0MTAwMjA4MDQzOW0zZWMxZjA1NXQ5ZWEyZWVjMWQ5MGE1YzFmQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgkgPDY1MThhOTM2MTAwMjA4MDU0N3kyODQ3MzJjZm42ZDY0MTQ5ODkwNWQ3Y2QxQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":50547,"nextInTopic":50551,"prevInTime":50548,"nextInTime":50550,"topicId":50546,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**directed more towards the young adult ^unschuestions** I lost the middle!  ...directed more towards the young adult unschoolers and their questions (twitter","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-641450103\">**directed more towards the young adult ^unschuestions**<br/>\n<br/>\nI lost the middle!  ...directed more towards the young adult unschoolers and<br/>\ntheir questions<br/>\n(twitter speak?)<br/>\n~diana :)<br/>\nxoxoxoxo<br/>\nhannahbearski.wordpress.com<br/>\nhannahsashes.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":288405080,"authorName":"diana jenner","from":"diana jenner &lt;hahamommy@...&gt;","profile":"dianajenner","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Mentoring?","postDate":"1265636863","msgId":50547,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY1MThhOTM2MTAwMjA4MDU0N3kyODQ3MzJjZm42ZDY0MTQ5ODkwNWQ3Y2QxQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDc5YzFkMWI0MTAwMjA4MDQzOW0zZWMxZjA1NXQ5ZWEyZWVjMWQ5MGE1YzFmQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDc5YzFkMWI0MTAwMjA4MDQzOW0zZWMxZjA1NXQ5ZWEyZWVjMWQ5MGE1YzFmQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":50546,"nextInTopic":50549,"prevInTime":50546,"nextInTime":50548,"topicId":50546,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"A couple of recommendations for the folks looking for softer *voice* for unschooling: First, get to a conference!

I read<br/>\nthe various threads, opinions of different people. I found two aspects<br/>\nintriguing - the need and the risks, which seem to be exclusive stances<br/>\ntaken by members.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere seems to be a need among some members to find &quot;softer guidance&quot;, which<br/>\nis *not* the same as not working on themselves. I understand this to mean<br/>\nthat they would like acknowledgment of what is and where they need to go<br/>\nmore than &#39;troubleshooting&#39;. It is obviously not impossible, if we look at<br/>\nmany transformative methodologies. It is possible to focus on desired change<br/>\nto create it. We find what we seek, and seeking problems with what is<br/>\nhappening quickly leads newcomers into insecure terrain, while experienced<br/>\nmembers cope fluidly based on their understanding of the method. Some<br/>\nwithdraw, others challenge, still others form breakaway groups, but the need<br/>\nunderlying them is the same - finding understanding (as distinct from hand<br/>\nholding and mollycoddling) in a way that they feel understood. Experienced<br/>\nmembers often understand. Sometimes better than the person with the issue,<br/>\nbut it feels judgmental, since we are not at an experience level to &#39;get<br/>\nit&#39;. I had a great deal of trouble with this initially (not that I promise<br/>\nits over, but...).<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, a separate list seems risky terrain too. It would be too<br/>\neasy for a bunch of new comers (including me) to pat each other on the back<br/>\nand go &quot;there, there, its all right...&quot;. It is easy to blur the lines<br/>\nbetween acceptance of a person and compromising goals. Even this quote of<br/>\nmine could be either, depending on context.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was wondering if mentoring could fill the need and reduce risks of<br/>\n&quot;slipping into complacency&quot;. If newbies finding it difficult to cope could<br/>\nfind experienced mentors of &quot;their favorite input flavor&quot;, they would slowly<br/>\nlearn to find that &quot;gentleness&quot; in the list itself in the caring; without<br/>\nneeding to withdraw or find alternate resources of dubious value.<br/>\nVersatility is a strength in a guide. A list like this is a tremendous<br/>\nsource for finding it, which a new list could not be. Could we leverage it<br/>\nto everyone&#39;s happiness?<br/>\n<br/>\nHas something like this been tried by unschoolers rather than the risk of<br/>\nbreakaway kindergarten lists people never graduate from? &lt;-- I got this<br/>\nconcern from something Sandra wrote<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;...people stay on bad trails instead of getting onto good ones. And the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; stronger responses were coming from mothers with less experience. Same<br/>\n&gt; emotional experience, less practical benefit....&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It is a difficult place for a newbie. Either shut up and cope with something<br/>\nthat is not helping you because it is on another level, or withdraw and go<br/>\nelsewhere and risk derailing your entire purpose for getting into all this.<br/>\nA mentor could help get over &quot;stucks&quot; and defensive anger and misunderstood<br/>\nintentions and understand the underlying processes helping people cope<br/>\nbetter and quicker and learn all through rather than be silenced to some<br/>\nback shelf and looked at later if they survive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not questioning how things are done, just looking at possibilities that<br/>\nmay exist for damage control of newbie acclimatization for the hundreds in<br/>\nhere that keep going through it all the time new people join and also the<br/>\nnewbies themselves who find it difficult to find value when they are so busy<br/>\ndefending themselves difficult to take expressions. It may also help us cope<br/>\nwith things we find extreme and want to reject and look underneath our<br/>\nreactions to the message and its meaning for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nVidyut<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: Now, I&#39;m cringing at how Sandra will rip this post apart. Then I look at<br/>\nmyself and ask for that trust and acceptance that she does it not because<br/>\nshe hates me, but because she sees areas for alarm. If I&#39;d like trust and<br/>\nacceptance of my intentions, I &#39;should&#39; find the courage to live it too, no?<br/>\nThen I look at this whole process and see how it could be much more<br/>\nsupportive, if I could sound the idea off an experienced mentor rather than<br/>\nlitter every inbox on the list if it is not really useful and I take a deep<br/>\nbreath and hit &#39;send&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23613,"nextTopicId":50478}}
