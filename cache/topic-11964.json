I think I had developed  the sense <br/>\nof the importance of this from my family of origin; I was the oldest  of nine <br/>\nchildren, and we were poor and always on the fringe, even with  relatives, most <br/>\nof whom lived close by, so that we could really feel the hurt  from lack of <br/>\ninclusion.

I <br/>\nwanted to develop a sense of family from a positive  perspective, with shared <br/>\ngoals/responsibilities, fun times and such.

Many meals I <br/>\nprepare on my own, but she does help me quite often. We live in <br/>\nthe same apartment and as such are a team.**<br/>\n<br/>\nRoberta, I think the dissonance you may be feeling between <br/>\nwhat you&#39;re writing and the responses you&#39;re getting might have <br/>\nto do more with word choice than with differing ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst I&#39;d like to reiterate what Sandra said. There are (basically) <br/>\ntwo types of unschooling lists. One is for support where people <br/>\nshare what they do and so they can get to know each other. The <br/>\nother is for discussion. People share problems they&#39;re having so <br/>\nthey can discuss it :-) So if there&#39;s anything you do that you don&#39;t <br/>\nwant people to pull out and say &quot;What do you mean by that? <br/>\nHave you really examined what you&#39;re doing?&quot; it&#39;s best not to <br/>\npost it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not that the list doesn&#39;t accept people for who they are. It&#39;s <br/>\nthat this list is specifically for discussing ideas. It&#39;s *for* holding <br/>\npractices and thoughts and ideas up to examination.<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than a place to kick back and let it all hang out, this is a <br/>\nplace where people come to have their ideas challenged, to look <br/>\nat life in ways they&#39;d never considered before.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically on this list the filter through which ideas pass is <br/>\ntreating children as fellow human beings. If someone presents <br/>\nan idea where it sounds like the child is being treated in a way <br/>\nthat an adult would be upset to be treated, the idea will raise red <br/>\nflags for many people. And the idea will be discussed.<br/>\n<br/>\n**She would have other kitchen duties if not that.**<br/>\n<br/>\nThis might be a word use problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Have&quot; suggests that your daughter has been assigned kitchen <br/>\nduties by someone else. &quot;Have&quot; suggests that if she doesn&#39;t do <br/>\nthem then there will be punishment.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that *idea* will raise red flags and people will want to <br/>\ndiscuss the *idea* of making children -- not your child, not what <br/>\nyou do in your home -- but the idea of making children do chores.<br/>\n<br/>\nStep back for a moment and treat this as though it weren&#39;t about <br/>\nwhat you&#39;re doing, but about broader ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes it help build a good relationship between two humans for <br/>\none human to have the power over another to tell them what to <br/>\ndo and to punish them if they don&#39;t?<br/>\n<br/>\n(Step back. This isn&#39;t about you. It&#39;s about how *people* feel.)<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of parents would say no, it doesn&#39;t help build a good <br/>\nrelationshp. They&#39;d probably be thinking about their spouse, <br/>\nsaying, &quot;I don&#39;t want my husband to tell me what to do and <br/>\npunish me if I don&#39;t!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet, without realizing it, they&#39;d be doing exactly that to their <br/>\nkids! They&#39;d make their kids do something and punish them (or <br/>\nmake them feel bad or get mad at them or ask them over and <br/>\nover and over ...) And they&#39;d say &quot;Yes, I&#39;m making her, but ___.&quot; <br/>\nAnd they&#39;d fill in the blank with &quot;they&#39;re kids&quot;, &quot;they don&#39;t know as <br/>\nmuch,&quot; &quot;someone has to be in charge,&quot; and so on and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what it all boils down to, regardless of the justification, we <br/>\nare tearing down a relationship when we assert our authority <br/>\nover someone weaker. When we take away someone&#39;s power to <br/>\nsay no, we are tearing down a good relationship and creating a <br/>\nrelationship of adversaries: Parent vs child. And when there are <br/>\nadversaries, there is a struggle for power. And when there is a <br/>\nstruggle for power there are winners and losers.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut none of those words: struggle, power, winner, loser have <br/>\nanything to do with building a loving relationship, do they? <br/>\nThey&#39;re all really yucky words to put into a relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there are better ways to be with kids than as adversaries. <br/>\nThere are ways to live life together, get all the things done that <br/>\nwe feel we&#39;d like to get done *and* build a loving relationship <br/>\nwith our kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we talk about it here. A lot :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n**We live in the same apartment and as such are a team.**<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the point that most parents would love to be at :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that being a team doesn&#39;t just happen by existing <br/>\ntogether. Children aren&#39;t born realizing they&#39;re part of a team so <br/>\nthey need to pitch in. In fact children are born believing everything <br/>\nis about them ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nTraditional parenting would say that kids need to be taught that <br/>\nlife isn&#39;t about them. Traditional parenting would say kids need <br/>\nto learn to do what parents say so kids can learn that life isn&#39;t all <br/>\nabout them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what that teaches kids is that life is all about being an adult <br/>\nso you can be bigger and get your way by telling others what to <br/>\ndo.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Turn that idea upside down. What if an adult thinks another <br/>\nadult needs to learn the lesson that others should be taken into <br/>\nconsideration too so starts ordering the other adult around, <br/>\nmaking the second adult do what the first adult wants. It just <br/>\nfeels *wrong*. But most parents, even if they see the wrongness <br/>\nof it, think that&#39;s life and kids just have to learn.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn this list we help people find better ways! :-) We help them see <br/>\nthat we can support kids in their belief that it&#39;s all about them. <br/>\nWhile *at the same time* helping them see  it&#39;s all about mom <br/>\nand big sister and dad too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that most parents don&#39;t know how to get to a <br/>\nfeeling of &quot;we&#39;re a team.&quot; Or they think they know but the ways <br/>\nthey&#39;ll go about it -- for instance making their kids do chores <br/>\nbecause they&#39;re a part of a team -- only work for kids who are <br/>\nvery compliant or desperately needing to please. Those ways <br/>\ntend to have the opposite effect on kids with other personalities. <br/>\nAnd when parents don&#39;t get the results they expect,  when the <br/>\nkids act resentful of being made to do chores, act as though their <br/>\nparents care more about the things they&#39;re making the kids do <br/>\nthan they do about the kids, the parents wonder what&#39;s wrong <br/>\nwith their kids. They wonder why Roberta&#39;s daughter is chopping <br/>\nvegetables happily for her mom while their own kids roll their <br/>\neyes and groan and do half-assed jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn this list we help people examine what goes into building <br/>\nrelationship so that we become people our kids want to help :-) <br/>\nIt&#39;s not just luck if kids help. There are ways we can relate to kids <br/>\nthat will foster a great relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\n**Through cooking I teach her her heritage - both sides.**<br/>\n<br/>\nTeach is another word land mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeach, for many people who are trying to understand <br/>\nunschooling, is a loaded word. It brings up pictures of a teacher <br/>\npushing information into a child.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe try to help people drop that image. And to help them drop that <br/>\nimage we try to help them see how learning is different from <br/>\nteaching.<br/>\n<br/>\n(There are ways that teaching is like learning *but* it&#39;s examining <br/>\nhow learning is *different* from teaching that helps people get <br/>\nunschooling.)<br/>\n<br/>\nTeaching is about pushing information in. Learning is about <br/>\nsomeone pulling something they want in.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce people can turn their thinking around from trying to get <br/>\nwhat they want a child to learn into the child to thinking in terms <br/>\nof what the child wants to pull in for himself, they&#39;re a lot closer to <br/>\nunderstanding unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n**Surely there are some things we can learn about how to do <br/>\nchores, but basically they are just something that need to be <br/>\ndone and if not we don&#39;t eat, have clean clothes, or a clean <br/>\nhome.**<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Need to&quot; is another word land mine. As you point out while there <br/>\nare things that we &quot;need to do&quot; it&#39;s helpful -- freeing! -- to turn that <br/>\npicture up side down so we can see it in a new way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIF we see everything we do as a choice, then it frees us from <br/>\nsome outside mysterious power that&#39;s supposedly making us <br/>\ndo such and such.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of people get trapped thinking they &quot;have to&quot; make dinner. <br/>\nThe truth is that they don&#39;t. They *choose* to make dinner for <br/>\nreasons that they don&#39;t think are even worth considering. But they <br/>\n*are* worth considering because if they aren&#39;t considered then it <br/>\nfeels like we don&#39;t have a choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t have to make dinner. We could order pizza. We could <br/>\neat frozen dinners. We could hire a chef. We could make a <br/>\nmonth of meals on one day and put them in the freezer. (The list <br/>\ncould go on.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut someone might *choose* to make dinner because ... It&#39;s <br/>\ncheaper. It&#39;s healthier. It&#39;s a way they enjoy showing someone <br/>\nthey care for them. (The list could go on.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that helped drive this idea home for me is that I always <br/>\nfelt I had to clean the toilet every x number of days. I didn&#39;t listen <br/>\nto the voice ;-) but that voice was there nagging me whenever I <br/>\nlooked at the toilet. And that guilt making voice made me <br/>\nresentful and rebellious so that I didn&#39;t clean the toilet.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then I stopped and said, no, I don&#39;t *have to* clean the toilet. <br/>\nBut sometimes it&#39;s really nice for the toilet to be clean. And from <br/>\nthen it became a choice. I no longer *had to* clean the toilet any <br/>\nmore! But sometimes I *chose to* clean the toilet because I <br/>\nwanted it clean :-) And ever since then, because I know I can say <br/>\nno anytime I want to, I do clean my toilet more often than when I <br/>\n&quot;had to&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that make any sense?<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one *has to* think that way but it&#39;s a really helpful way if <br/>\nsomeone finds themselves stuck with the idea of &quot;have to&quot; and <br/>\nthey&#39;d like to change.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really  really really helps on a discussion list to step back from <br/>\nsomething you do when it&#39;s being discussed and look at it as an <br/>\nabstract idea. Look at it from a distance as though it&#39;s <br/>\ngeneralized and not about you any more. Turn it this way and <br/>\nthat. Turn kids into adults. Turn adults into kids. Turn ideas <br/>\nupside down and inside out. Expand it. If it&#39;s a good idea then it <br/>\ncan cover more than one thing. For example many people come <br/>\nto unschooling thinking it&#39;s just about academic learning, that <br/>\nkids can learn best by learning what interests them. And then <br/>\nthey start thinking, hmm, if that&#39;s true, then why is it true only of <br/>\nacademics? Why, if I&#39;ll let my child choose when and how to <br/>\nlearn math concepts, am I making her sit at the table and learn <br/>\ntable manners? And they&#39;ll expand it more and start questioning <br/>\nall sorts of things they never thought to question.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically this list is for people who want the ideas of how to build <br/>\na relationship with their kids, who don&#39;t want to do things that will <br/>\ntear the relationship down.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re doing things differently, that&#39;s okay. :-) It&#39;s just that this <br/>\nisn&#39;t the list to *talk* about how we all do things differently. It&#39;s a <br/>\nplace to discuss how we can respect our kids and still manage <br/>\nto get all the things done we want to and discuss that in ways <br/>\nthat will help others figure out how to make it work for them too.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"chores","postDate":"1043738905","msgId":11964,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyNi4yMGJlZDIwZS4yYjY3OGIxOUBjcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":22775,"prevInTime":11963,"nextInTime":11965,"topicId":11964,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Something has happened that I thought impossible....I have stopped trying to force my kids to do chores (almost all the time, not perfect yet ) and have","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-65828377\">&quot;Something has happened that I thought impossible....I have stopped trying to <br/>\nforce my kids to do chores (almost all the time, not perfect yet &lt;g&gt;) and <br/>\nhave cheerfully done these things myself instead.
