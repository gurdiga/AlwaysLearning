It can&#39;t be  <br/>\nhelped.  Growing up after labor unions and workplace regulations  <br/>\nabout hours and breaks and conditions were very common, the idea that  <br/>\nlife should be fair and somewhat equalized, and no one in the same  <br/>\nposition should &quot;have to&quot; work harder than others of the same grade  <br/>\nand rank seem like realities.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo speak of mothering or parenting as &quot;a job&quot; doesn&#39;t seem to show  <br/>\nthe realities of it clearly.   Having reproduced, one is a mother or  <br/>\na father.  Having adopted, one is a mother or a father.  That&#39;s what  <br/>\nit is.  The only thing remaining then is whether to be a good parent  <br/>\nor not.  There is no court of appeals to say &quot;Yes, you get a nanny  <br/>\nbecause you have so many kids,&quot; or &quot;Yes, you can go to lunch like  <br/>\nyour friends who have two kids, even though you have six.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEach child needs as much love and attention as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes the parents are very needy due to their own backgrounds or  <br/>\nupbringing.  Rather than having children fulfill my needs, I found  <br/>\nother outlets and sources for processing my personal problems.    <br/>\nLists like this can be helpful, and I spent some years in Adult  <br/>\nChildren of Alcoholics meetings, and La Leche League was great for  <br/>\nmoms helping moms too.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeedy parents could beget needy children just as spanked children can  <br/>\nbeget spanked children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI opted to try to make sure my children weren&#39;t needy.  That&#39;s going  <br/>\nto be different in different families and different circumstances,  <br/>\nand with different kids.  The practicalities are going to be  <br/>\ndifferent, but the principles are the same.  No mom is guaranteed six  <br/>\nconsecutive hours of sleep.  No mom is guaranteed an hour to herself  <br/>\nfree, or even fifteen minute coffee breaks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn early investment in children&#39;s happiness pays off pretty quickly,  <br/>\nthough, and in the long run moms gets LOTS of peace and quiet when  <br/>\ntheir kids are older and helpful and trustworthy and content.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31344,"nextTopicId":31359}}
