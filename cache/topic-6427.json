Keep in mind that I have been stewing about<br/>\nthis for two years. Matthew and I were pretty close to of this guy in our<br/>\ninterest of robotics.  Nothing else. In no other way did we interact. My<br/>\ndiscovery had shook me up pretty badly.  I had a very difficult time, at 42,<br/>\ntrying to figure out what to do.  I couldn&#39;t imagine my 10 year-old being<br/>\nany less shocked.  That protection instinct kicked in.  So, now at 12 years<br/>\nold he&#39;s 20 percent older and probably better equipped to deal with the<br/>\nconcept.  What I don&#39;t want to happen is to have robotics and white<br/>\nsupremacy linked together in Matthew&#39;s mind, like it now is in mine.  Would<br/>\nyou feel the same way if this person was Rosie&#39;s riding instructor? Or one<br/>\nof the ceramic artists that Roya is studying under? Matthew and I have had<br/>\ndiscussions about bigotry and racism and white supremacy. I think he<br/>\nunderstands the repugnant concept.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe closeness of it is what bothers me. And maybe that&#39;s why I should do<br/>\nwhat you suggest.  I have understood the concept for many years.  But when<br/>\nit hits close to home it&#39;s exponentially more painful.  A while back Joylyn<br/>\ntalked about her children, children I&#39;ve enjoyed company of at many a park<br/>\nday, being refused service by some *sshole at Denny&#39;s while traveling. I had<br/>\nread the news stories and the court case about this very subject and may<br/>\nhave even discussed it with Matthew. But now the ugly concept hits my home<br/>\n(or at least my park day group) and I begin to lose rational thought about<br/>\nher kids, Denny&#39;s, and being hungry while on the road.  My reaction is to<br/>\nprotect my son from this kind of confusion and pain.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it&#39;s only *my* problem?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll bet Joylyn feels differently.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Dan Vilter</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1798873,"authorName":"PSoroosh@aol.com","from":"PSoroosh@...","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: What would you do?","postDate":"1020326705","msgId":6622,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ3LjE2Zjc5NmFmLjJhMDI0ZDMxQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":6557,"nextInTopic":6625,"prevInTime":6621,"nextInTime":6623,"topicId":6427,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/1/2002 11:39:58 AM Pacific Daylight Time, ...

Most of<br/>\nthe members are retired aerospace and defense engineers.  We both learned a<br/>\ngreat deal from them. The meetings get me thinking in ways I don&#39;t normally<br/>\ndo. There is usually a kind of class about the basics of robotics before the<br/>\nregular monthly meeting.  During these classes we&#39;ve learned about basic<br/>\nelectronics, programming, structure, robotic theory, and hardware<br/>\ndevelopment.  For about a year-and-a-half these class&#39;s were led by a<br/>\nmiddle-aged, and non retired guy.  Very sharp.  He always took an interest<br/>\nin what we were doing and gave us useful tutoring.  He maintains a web site<br/>\non robotics as part of his personal Web site.  It has lots of good<br/>\ninformation.  Then one day I was clicking around on his site and came across<br/>\nthe heading &quot; things that interest me.&quot; He is a smart, interesting guy, I<br/>\nclicked on it.      There were links to engineering sites, science-fiction<br/>\nfantasy sites among othres, and there it was.<br/>\n<br/>\nA link to a white supremacists site.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was in shock.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to scream.<br/>\n<br/>\nNever once did the subject ever come up. I would have *never* guessed he had<br/>\nto such interests. I never felt he had a hidden agenda or that he was<br/>\npromoting such ideas.  It was just a link.  A link outside of the robotics<br/>\narea. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is: What would you do in this situation?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not asking a political or racial question here, I&#39;m asking an<br/>\neducational one.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is the  &quot;AlwaysLearning&quot; situation here?

I do miss the conversation here on<br/>\nAlwaysLearning but I&#39;m not interested in spending my time wading through the<br/>\ncontention and personal attacks that were so common on the Unschoolingdotcom<br/>\nlist last year when I quit it, at the time Sandra started this list.<br/>\nJocelyn tells me that the Unschoolingdotcom list is not nearly so bad as it<br/>\nwas last year, but is still far from the friendly atmosphere of this list.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe time I can spend on e-mail lists is limited and fluctuates wildly in<br/>\nrelation to my work schedule.  I hope what I have to say is of benefit to<br/>\nthe unschooling community.
