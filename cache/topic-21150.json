Sometimes he does wonder if what he is doing is because it is  truly what <br/>\nhe would have chosen if he had been left alone to choose or if  he was swayed <br/>\nby family.  He does enjoy his job but it is all he  knows.  He will sometimes <br/>\nwonder if he had not had that influence would  there have been something else <br/>\nthat he would have loved even more.  He  sometimes wonders if he grew up in an <br/>\nenvironment close to what we are trying to  do for our children would he have <br/>\nfollowed a different path.  Was there a  path out there that he was meant to <br/>\nbe on and he got sidetracked by school,  family pressures etc.<br/>\n <br/>\nPam G<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21134,"nextTopicId":21157}}
