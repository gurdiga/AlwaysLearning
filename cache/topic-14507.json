I <br/>\ncollect the answers (mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gw@...\">gw@...</a>) from all you <br/>\ngreat people, and compile the following and send it in with the <br/>\noriginal question and a Subject heading: SUMMARY: Social Scene) &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good idea is that unschooling and parenting <br/>\naren&#39;t like web design, where a code works no matter what the motivation of <br/>\nthe programmer was, or whether the programmer was honest.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I do NOT want answers offlist.  The discussion is heavily <br/>\ndependent on how the answers are first worded, for me, because this is <br/>\ninterpersonal stuff and cognitive stuff, not technical stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is an analogy for a purpose, so go with it instead of just saying &quot;Poof, <br/>\nnot applicable,&quot; okay?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the SCA we have discussions about who should be elevated to peerage <br/>\n(knighthood, order of the Laurel, etc.)   In some kingdoms they do it in <br/>\nwriting and someone summarizes and that goes out batch-like, and without <br/>\nnames.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, on a matter involving integrity and personal knowledge, I not only <br/>\nwant to know who said what, but I&#39;d prefer to see them say it.  Our kingdom <br/>\nhas those meetings in person, without notes taken even, and we say what we&#39;re <br/>\ngoing to say in front of the other members of the order who choose to be <br/>\nthere.  Who speaks how and after whom and how they choose to say what they <br/>\nsay and what upsets them, all that is important information in the overall <br/>\npicture of WHY they think what they think.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there&#39;s the other extreme. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAn online discussion about unschooling and parenting is halfway between those <br/>\ntwo, I think.  It&#39;s about interpersonal/emotional stuff, rather than <br/>\ntechnical.  And I can&#39;t see faces and glances between people, but it DOES <br/>\nmatter to me whether the information is coming from someone I trust, who has <br/>\nseemed selfless and generous in the past, whose kids DO have a good <br/>\nrelationship with them, or whether it&#39;s just theoretical noise from someone <br/>\nwhose kids were in school last year and might be in next year, who have no <br/>\nspecial relationship with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo have those recommendations all rolled together in one summary would make <br/>\nthem less pure, less alive, less dynamic.  At that point it would be FAQs, <br/>\nnot exchanges.  For web design or deck building or cooking, that would be <br/>\nGREAT!!!
