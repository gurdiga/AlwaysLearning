We ended up with quite a few leftover cupcakes to take home. On our way home we see an old abandoned building with a really high winding staircase that leads to nowhere or anywhere depending on your imagination. This is a place that we have stopped off to explore many times. It&#39;s just an awesome place to throw rocks, pretend, look at, wonder about, etc. So, we stop there and the kids decide to climb the staircase and see what happens if you drop a cupcake from 20 feet in the air....  It&#39;s pretty funny sounding when it splats on the ground. They decided to save a few to sling shot when we got back home. <br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun with your food. Buy cupcakes and M&Ms. Also, buy asparagus and bananas. When the kids go grocery shopping with me and as we go down the isles I ask, what are we going to eat this week? Sometimes they choose dragon fruit, beef jerky, donuts, corn dogs, asparagus, chicken, fish..... If they don&#39;t go with me, I still ask, what are we going to eat this week?  I just add to my list of things we all want. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother-in-law taught me a valuable lesson when my kids were small. Let them eat and have fun doing it. Don&#39;t put my anxieties on them. We were at a little league game and she bought them giant pixie sticks. They are plastic tubes about a foot long filled with flavored sugar. I looked at her like she was crazy for giving my kids all that sugar!!  She looked at me like just wait and see. She gave them the pixie sticks while I stood by watching and waiting. Honestly I thought they would probably get sick from eating so much sugar. They loved their Nanna for buying them such a great &quot;toy&quot;. Toy???  Yes, toy. They tasted the sugar and enjoyed it. They also jumped up and down watching most of the sugar fly away on the wind. It was a fun and delightful memory for us all. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have an annual get together with friends. It&#39;s called, Play with Your Food Day&quot;.  Every family brings a variety of foods (fruit, candies, veggies) and a box of toothpicks. The kids take the food and build whatever with it using the toothpicks to hold it all together.

If the cookies are always on a high shelf and they need to ask in order to get some, consider putting the cookies on a lower shelf so they can help themselves.  During the first month of so, you might find that the cookies run out quickly.  But over time, you&#39;ll probably find the cookies have not run out.  In fact, they may be going stale.  This Halloween was particularly bountiful for my girls, and we have oodles of Halloween candy left about that I should freeze so that it doesn&#39;t spoil.  The same for the Christmas cookies.

It&#39;s awful!  It reminds me of stripping the food from the larder, or something.  It sounds very demeaning and negative like a deprivation.   Regarding buying things when they ask or keeping things on hand, just think about what is most convenient for you.  If a particular food item is gone, can you make a home-made option?  Can you bake some special treats?  Is it easier to buy pre made stuff and keep it on hand, or is it easy to run to the store to pick up more.

Maybe that will mean buying more cookies - or more ingredients to make them.

Read that link Sandra posted about the economics of limits, that&#39;s important.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you run out of things someone wants, it Feels like that thing is limited, a luxury item. It&#39;s natural to feast on luxury foods. If kids feel like they&#39;re competing for something, it will feel like a kind of limit - so with a food, they might &quot;compete&quot; to eat the most of something or to have the last bite. If you Treat food like a luxury (hand it out grudgingly or with conditions for instance) it&#39;s more likely to seem limited even if it isn&#39;t. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd what you mean by &quot;stuff your face&quot; can play a part in when you say yes or no, when you get more or have more in stock, when you impose conditions. If you expect kids to eat a particular way and are judging them against that standard it can keep you from seeing the way kids make choices and learn about food. It&#39;s normal for kids to go from one favorite food to another, for instance - and if you&#39;re expecting a school-book &quot;balanced diet&quot; that may very well look like a child &quot;stuffing his face&quot;... this week on cookies, next week on muffins, the week after on popsicles, the next on chicken nuggets, even if he&#39;s eating other things as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;do I just buy things when they ask, or do I always make sure we have the sweets, cookies, fruits, veggies, etc on hand?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nBe thoughtful and take your kids&#39; interests and wants seriously. Offer foods you&#39;re confident they&#39;ll eat and foods you think they might like to try. Invite them to help prepare food. If they seem interested, invite them to help you shop or make grocery lists. Don&#39;t make food a big deal in a negative way but something to share and enjoy together. Depending on your kids, it might be fun to shop in some new places - ethnic markets or farmers&#39; markets, or even just a different store than you usual, to mix things up and add some variety to your life, something new to explore together. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Help with Defooding","postDate":"1356737308","msgId":70003,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNTY3MzczMDguMzI4MTYuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE4NjEwMi5tYWlsLmlyMi55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGtia25pbCttM2V1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtia25pbCttM2V1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":70002,"nextInTopic":70004,"prevInTime":70002,"nextInTime":70004,"topicId":69998,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"When they are little they need different foods then what they will need when they grow.

The foods that appeal to a young child will be different to the foods that appeal to an older child or to an adult. I bet there are things you can remember liking when you were a child that just don&#39;t appeal now. They are too sweet or too fatty or too something. And the reverse is probably true as well, that is there are foods that you like now that you didn&#39;t like as a child. Foods that seemed to bitter, probably, when you were a child now are wonderful and you relish them. I bet there are foods that appeal to you now at varying times of the month. I bet as you&#39;ve moved from not pregnant to pregnant to lactating your diet has changed in response to that. <br/>\n<br/>\nChildren are growing rapidly. They are developing brain matter, which is really energetically expensive stuff to grow. They are building bone and muscle and they need high energy and high fat foods to do that well. Which is all to say that looking for a day in the not to distant future when they stop enjoying foods that fill that energetic requirement, the day when they are over the stuff your face with sweets period, may be a false understanding of why those foods are appealing. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat isn&#39;t to say that parental limits on foods don&#39;t create a false economy. By limiting your child to 10 M&Ms you are absolutely ensuring that M&Ms have greater value than a food you let them eat indiscriminately. However the reverse won&#39;t necessarily work, that is limiting your child to a small number of something they don&#39;t like won&#39;t make that something suddenly appealing. They like M&Ms because M&Ms fill a nutritional and energetic need. Whereas deriving nutrients from something like spinach leaves is fairly biologically taxing. That&#39;s why sloths move so slow. That&#39;s why koalas aren&#39;t running around like toddlers.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra outlined much better approaches to changing your relationship with food. Say yes more. Offer lots of yummy things that are easy for them to access and that are appealing to their palates. Make monkey platters with lots of good dips and good foods and when they ask for M&Ms say yes to those as well. The more proactive you are about feeding them, the more you offer food forward, the less they will be crashing and needing fast energy sources by the time they come to ask for food. And the less they will lean on those foods that you have relegated to the treat drawer. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n From: Bryanna &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bryannajj@...\">bryannajj@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Saturday, 29 December 2012, 4:14<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Help with Defooding<br/>\n <br/>\nHi!

What is the &quot;average&quot; time it takes for them to get over the stuff your face with sweets stage? A week, a month, longer?
