Sometimes we extroverts are <br/>\nso bull-headed that we just can&#39;t seem to understand the need for <br/>\nintroverts to recharge with solitude.  When dh and I were dating, I <br/>\nwould drag him out to parties and receptions where there would be rooms <br/>\nfull with people.  To me -- this was a like diving into a huge box of <br/>\nchocolate -- and I would plunge right in.  He would gamely try to follow <br/>\nme, but I would later find him hugging the wall in some remote corner.   <br/>\nAt one party there was a huge room -- hundreds of people, lots of <br/>\npolitical celebrities -- and I was in heaven!  I turned to find dh and <br/>\nhe looked terrible -- green and pasty, clammy and trembling.  He looked <br/>\nlike he was about to faint.  I realized that he was having a physical <br/>\nreaction to the situation -- that was just the opposite of my enjoyment <br/>\nof it.  After that, I truly understood that we&#39;re just wired differently.<br/>\n<br/>\nDh&#39;s family has told me that after being around me for 15 years, he&#39;s <br/>\nbecome more out-going and participatory. And I&#39;ve been told that I&#39;ve <br/>\nbecome more reflective and quiet.  (Not that I&#39;m all that quiet now -- <br/>\nmaybe just less &quot;out-there&quot; than I used to be.) I really appreciate the <br/>\nintroverts in my life because I think they&#39;re better at observing the <br/>\nthings that I miss while I&#39;m so busy &quot;interacting.&quot;   <br/>\n<br/>\n~ Alicia<br/>\n<br/>\nJanet Hamlin wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Speaking as an introvert, you can&#39;t make us extroverts!  I have just been<br/>\n&gt; reading some diaries I wrote when I was 18 and living in Peru as an <br/>\n&gt; exchange<br/>\n&gt; student.  The recurring theme was:  Why can&#39;t people accept me like I <br/>\n&gt; am?  I<br/>\n&gt; should be more outgoing, friendly, yada yada yada.  No one had told me it<br/>\n&gt; was OK to just be myself and that being an introvert was OK!!  I enjoy <br/>\n&gt; being<br/>\n&gt; with people and having fun, but I reach my limit after a few hours and <br/>\n&gt; need<br/>\n&gt; to be alone.  In fact, I wrote, &quot;I really just like to be by myself to <br/>\n&gt; read<br/>\n&gt; and think my own thoughts.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It was interesting to read that while my basic personality traits are <br/>\n&gt; still<br/>\n&gt; the same, I accept myself for who I am and I am not afraid or ashamed of<br/>\n&gt; needing my quiet times to recharge.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Janet, off on a tangent......<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
