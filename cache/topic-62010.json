That&#39;s a dangerous leap, I think, to pathologize a normal childhood feeling into a deficiency, a handicap.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe sounds like a child who happily plays with others, leaves the house regularly, and simply feels more comfortable when mom is near.  Because the majority of children her age are forced to spend 5+ hours a day away from home, doesn&#39;t make it normal. It doesn&#39;t make accepting it (the child, that is) natural, either.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy brother was truly crippled with anxiety for a years.  He was afraid, even, to breath. His anxiety was an impairment and there was rarely a moment in a day when he wasn&#39;t feeling it.  That sounds nothing at all like what the OP described.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeeling anxious when separated from mom is normal, although school culture would have you believe otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Just like you read and post to this forum to get advice<br/>\nfrom knowledgeable people in the unschooling area, if you feel it would be<br/>\nbest for you then why not speak to someone who has experience and expertise<br/>\nin anxiety?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair for any of us to say that you are overreacting as<br/>\nonly you know what your daughter is like and you can hardly sum it all up in<br/>\na couple of paragraphs. Obviously it has got to a point where you have<br/>\ndecided to reach out for some help.-------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you didn&#39;t read mom&#39;s follow up post, where she wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- It&#39;s hard for me to stay focused and do what feels natural to me<br/>\nas a mom sometimes. I second guess my gut feelings when I have a pediatrician<br/>\nreferring us to a psychiatrist and relatives who think she may need medication. <br/>\nI&#39;ve heard so much advice telling me I need to start leaving her more or even<br/>\nput her in school to help her overcome her fears. Your words are like a breath<br/>\nof fresh air. ------<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing with her daughter feels *natural* to mom! Her &quot;gut feelings&quot; are that it&#39;s okay for her daughter to want her close-by.  It&#39;s the rest of the (schooled) world that thinks these are feelings that need to be trained or medicated away.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOften, this list is one of the only places a parent can come for words that are different than they&#39;ll hear any where else children and parenting are discussed.  Please don&#39;t taint that &quot;breath of fresh air&quot; with fear mongering about debilitating mental illness for what is a very common childhood experience.  Are you aware that the majority of school avoidance cases start when a child is 7 or 8?  There&#39;s a good reason for that--it is perfectly normal to still want to be with your parents at that age!<br/>\n<br/>\n----- But there are things that can be done to help without sending your daughter to a professional if you don&#39;t want to do that. I&#39;d start with reading up on it. Maybe look into<br/>\nemotion coaching (characterized by empathy, empowerment, helping your<br/>\ndaughter learn to solve her own problems------<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with Emotional Coaching, as I see it, is that it posits one set of emotional responses as more appropriate than others, in order to create a better functioning person.  But, the question I ask is: who defines functional? better?  appropriate? According to which/whose norms and standards?<br/>\n<br/>\n---helping your daughter learn to solve her own problems----<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the beauty of unschooling, for me, is that our family acts as a team.  While I&#39;ve done a lot to help my daughter feel empowered, I hope to always be trusted enough that if she wants or needs help solving problems, she&#39;ll come to me.  She&#39;s seven, eight next month, and I am honored that she comes to me for help when she needs it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t feel that I need to train her to be self-suficient. She&#39;s learning that, just as she&#39;s learning everything else: in her own time, in her own way, because she wants to--because it is meaningful to her--not because I think it&#39;s time for that lesson.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrie<br/>\n(whose daughter hasn&#39;t gone to the bathroom by herself in almost a year, and whose father, a psychologist, thinks this is perfectly normal--just something that is typically beat out of children by schooling)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":229470537,"authorName":"Jessica Cleary","from":"Jessica Cleary &lt;jessica.cleary@...&gt;","profile":"jessmegc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: seperation anxiety in 8 year old","postDate":"1311683478","msgId":62038,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBRmRXM3BRTGpMNEYyS2hFcGY5Q0g3dVhDK01VQ0hzTUxkWituSGdnVW11WlRlWW5Zd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGowbDJiNytxZGVuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDkzMzkyRkI5LTM1RTgtNDk2MS05NTgyLUYyNTIyOEUyOTg5RkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4gPGowbDJiNytxZGVuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":62035,"nextInTopic":62042,"prevInTime":62037,"nextInTime":62039,"topicId":62010,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I agree with the others that sending your daughter to a psychiatrist is not a good move.

No matter how kind and caring the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; psychiatrist, not a single one will say &quot;This is normal.

And second, they don&#39;t know any children who were<br/>\n&gt; &gt; allowed to stay home, were allowed to take dealing with a wider range<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of people on their own schedule.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What choice do they have in how they see themselves?

Try to change your own thinking about this, and enjoy a fun summer with your little girl. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":416257280,"authorName":"gkcollins123","from":"&quot;gkcollins123&quot; &lt;gkcollins123@...&gt;","profile":"gkcollins123","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: seperation anxiety in 8 year old","postDate":"1311640743","msgId":62035,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGowbDJiNytxZGVuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDkzMzkyRkI5LTM1RTgtNDk2MS05NTgyLUYyNTIyOEUyOTg5RkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":62032,"nextInTopic":62038,"prevInTime":62034,"nextInTime":62036,"topicId":62010,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you so much to all who have replied so far.

I knew that posting here would be so helpful.  I do not currently have anyone (other than my husband) who agrees she should be supported and left to develop at her own pace without being forced to &quot;face her fears&quot; to get past the seperation anxiety.  We have not met any other unschoolers in our area, and our friends and relatives really just don&#39;t get it.  It&#39;s hard for me to stay focused and do what feels natural to me as a mom sometimes.  I second guess my gut feelings when I have a pediatrician referring us to a psychiatrist and relatives who think she may need medication.  I&#39;ve heard so much advice telling me I need to start leaving her more or even put her in school to help her overcome her fears.  Your words are like a breath of fresh air. Unschooling has been such a wonderful journey for our family.  Thank you to all of you who contribute to this list.  You help so much. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Jul 25, 2011, at 2:25 PM, gkcollins123 wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Shortly after her 7th birthday, she began to display the seperation  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; anxiety that she still has to this day.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; While Kat didn&#39;t have separation anxiety, about that age she wouldn&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; go anywhere in the house alone.

My son, who is nearly 10, has always wanted to be close but over the last year has needed to be closer than usual and gets rather anxious if I am out of sight.

We chose to pull her out of school in the spring of her kindergarten year, and we&#39;ve been unschooling since then.  Shortly after her 7th birthday, she began to display the seperation anxiety that she still has to this day.  She is now 8.5 years old.   It began with her no longer wanting to spend the night with her friends or grandparents anymore ( two things she once loved to do).  Next, she stopped going to the neighbors house to play with her best friend.  She still happily plays with her friends, it just has to be at our house.  Currently, she won&#39;t go anywhere without me.  The few times I have had to leave her with my mom, she cries and gets very distressed (she&#39;ll cry the whole day before I have to leave her).  Since this has been going on for so long, I called the pediatrician, who recommended we see a psychiatrist.  I just want to do the best thing for my daughter.  So far, we have tried our best to support her and have not pressured her to do anything that makes her feel uneasy.  For example, a year ago, I enrolled her in an art class that her best friend was taking since she loves art and had told her friend she would take the class with her.  She got very panicky before classes and complained of stomach aches.  We took her out of the class, and the stomach problems and nervousness went away. I struggle with whether or not I am doing what I should be doing for her.  I read online that if these issues are not dealt with at an early age, they can become very severe anxiety disorders in the teenage years and beyond.  I would appreciate any advise.  I&#39;m concerned about seeing the psychiatrist and going that route.  But I&#39;m also concerned that if I don&#39;t do anything about it, things may get worse for my daughter.  Just a bit of background info:  We are an extremely close-nit family.  My daughter has never suffered any trauma ( there was not an event that I can recall that precipitated this).  Anxiety runs in my family. <br/>\nThank you!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":61923,"nextTopicId":62037}}
