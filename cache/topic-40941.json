Mainly because of remembering what it was like <br/>\nfor me as a child, laying awake for hours before I could go to sleep. He&#39;s already ahead of <br/>\nthe game, compared to where I was as a child. Once he goes to sleep, he stays asleep, as <br/>\nlong as he&#39;s near us. We cosleep so that&#39;s not a problem. And I agree, he will get used to <br/>\nit, and learn coping mechanisms to help himself go to sleep. What I want to do is help that <br/>\nprocess along a little, just give him some ideas. It took me until my mid-twenties to really <br/>\nlearn how to fall asleep, and some times I still have trouble. When I lay awake with my <br/>\nmind spinning, it is not pleasant. He&#39;s alot like me, so I have to be careful not to draw <br/>\nparallels willy-nilly, but I do believe that he Is sometimes bothered by it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve already ordered some stories from the library that he can listen too, and I know that I <br/>\nalso need to get us outdoors more. It does help him. In the winter it&#39;s difficult, as he&#39;s <br/>\nsensitive in many other ways, as well, to cold, wet, etc. He prefers the regularity of <br/>\nindoors, even in the summer. But there are some outdoor things he really likes to do, and <br/>\nthere&#39;s a gymnastics open time that he really enjoys, which we won&#39;t be able to go to for a <br/>\ncouple of weeks, as his thumb was slammed in the door last night by his little brother.

Also, when he&#39;d want to  make a trip <br/>\ndownstairs (that was his way of gauging whether or not he was &quot;being  made to&quot; do <br/>\n&quot;bedtime&quot;), I&#39;d ask what he needed, offer to get it myself or have  someone else <br/>\nbring it up, and if he still wanted to get it, it was fine.  Sometimes a trip <br/>\nfor a cup of milk would take 20 minutes, but I either joined  him and the rest <br/>\nof the family downstairs for a while or, more often, I would  just wait <br/>\nupstairs for him to come back.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnother thing that helped with the transition from &quot;living  area&quot; to <br/>\n&quot;sleeping area&quot; was some sort of a game. Chase was a popular one for a  while, with <br/>\nvariations on who was chasing and who was escaping, always ending on  the bed <br/>\nwith great roars and giggles. Another was tossing on the bed, where I&#39;d  put his <br/>\nbelly on my shoulder and count to 3, then toss him (using his legs for  <br/>\nleverage) onto the bed with a *bounce*. A game of tickle sometimes works, but he  <br/>\njust doesn&#39;t seem to like that at bedtime, for some reason. Very recently, he&#39;s <br/>\n been interested in helping Malachi, his Cabbage Patch doll, get ready for <br/>\nbed:  changing clothes, snuggling, tucking into bed, combing hair. When it <br/>\nbecomes too  routine or resistant, we just change things up and try something new.  <br/>\nInspiration comes from strange sources, sometimes-I never would have thought  <br/>\nactive things like &quot;chase&quot; or bed-tossing would be conductive to sleep, but I <br/>\n think they make the bedroom and bed a fun area rather than something to be  <br/>\ndreaded for Storm.<br/>\n <br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nDe<br/>\n**************Make your life easier with all your friends, email, and <br/>\nfavorite sites in one place.

(In bed next to a guy  who can<br/>\n&gt;  fall asleep in 30 seconds with light, noise and in an uncomfortable<br/>\n&gt;  position-very frustrating). Books don&#39;t do it for me, they just encourage my  brain to go.<br/>\n&gt;  Movies, too, though to a lesser degree. Hand-held video games, on  the other<br/>\n&gt;  hand, are a sure-fire solution. I started out with a cheap Solitaire  game,<br/>\n&gt;  went to a Monopoly game, and then to Game Boys. It took a while for me  (over 30<br/>\n&gt;  at the time) to get &quot;bored&quot; enough with the game for it to work, but  they<br/>\n&gt;  occupy my brain *just enough* to keep it from going to exciting things, yet  if<br/>\n&gt;  I have the right game (something with lots of repetition), it doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;  stimulate my brain. These days, I&#39;ve gotten to the point that on a good night, I  can<br/>\n&gt;  be asleep within 5 minutes-with a video game. They don&#39;t even have to be<br/>\n&gt;  that boring or repetitive any more.

It isn&#39;t terribly  <br/>\nuncommon - maybe as many as 10 percent of people have it over the  <br/>\ncourse of a lifetime, and a significant percentage of people have it  <br/>\nas children. It is almost never diagnosed in children, most people  <br/>\nbrush it off as &quot;growing pains&quot; or even as a form of hyperactivity. I  <br/>\nused to tell my mom, night after night, that my legs &quot;wanted to run&quot;  <br/>\neven when I wanted to sleep. It isn&#39;t anything to take lightly, it is  <br/>\npure agony and has serious health repercussions. It is another good  <br/>\nreason to sleep with your child because if you&#39;re sending them off to  <br/>\nsleep alone, you won&#39;t realize how awful the constant overwhelming  <br/>\nurge to move the legs is.  It may or may not involve actual pain -  <br/>\nmine does, but some people describe it as &quot;ants under the skin&quot;  <br/>\ndiscomfort. People with RLS become depressed and have lots of other  <br/>\nserious health issues that all have chronic lack of decent sleep as  <br/>\nthe root cause.<br/>\n<br/>\nLight leg massage is a wonder for children with RLS - and distraction  <br/>\nis almost essential (listening too books on my iPod nano is my  <br/>\nfavorite distraction - it has a sleep timer, so shuts itself off).   <br/>\nFor help getting to sleep, when sleepy but too mentally active to  <br/>\nrelax, melatonin can be wonderful. It is the one thing that gives a  <br/>\ntruly deep good sleep - not drug-induced, but natural. Don&#39;t give them  <br/>\nover-the-counter sleep medications - they usually have benadryl  <br/>\n(antihistamine) in them (including tylenol pm, etc) - benadryl  <br/>\naggravates RLS in most people.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, if your child complains that their can&#39;t hold their legs still  <br/>\nor that their legs feel creepy or weird or tingly or excited or achy  <br/>\nor painful, consider the possibility of RLS. It is genetic, but not a  <br/>\nsimple pass-down from parent to child - it seems to be the result of a  <br/>\nseries of genes, not just one.

We have twin 3 year olds who struggle with going to bed sometimes. One of them seems to get more active when he gets sleepy! When we notice sleepiness we begin winding things down in the house! Mom and Dad usually end up in a recliner with a book, lights are dimmed, because it is winter here Daddy starts a fire, etc. It seems that when the boys see all of this they automatically begin changing their activities too. They pull out the quiet legos, cars, etc. and sit behind the couches and play. What has really made a drastic change is when we are heading off to bed, we ask the boys if they are ready to go around and turn off all the lights! We hoped that by making them active participants in preparing for bed they would be more willing. They love it, and up to this point have wanted to do it! After turning off all of the lights they automatically head up for bed, on their own!

Before I found my own  solution, it used to <br/>\ntake me hours to fall asleep. Dark, quiet room, comfortable  bed, sleepy self, <br/>\nyet an hour was the shortest time-no matter how tired I was-I  could fall <br/>\nasleep in, sometimes 2, 3 even 4 or more hours. (In bed next to a guy  who can <br/>\nfall asleep in 30 seconds with light, noise and in an uncomfortable  <br/>\nposition-very frustrating). Books don&#39;t do it for me, they just encourage my  brain to go. <br/>\nMovies, too, though to a lesser degree. Hand-held video games, on  the other <br/>\nhand, are a sure-fire solution. I started out with a cheap Solitaire  game, <br/>\nwent to a Monopoly game, and then to Game Boys. It took a while for me  (over 30 <br/>\nat the time) to get &quot;bored&quot; enough with the game for it to work, but  they <br/>\noccupy my brain *just enough* to keep it from going to exciting things, yet  if <br/>\nI have the right game (something with lots of repetition), it doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nstimulate my brain. These days, I&#39;ve gotten to the point that on a good night, I  can <br/>\nbe asleep within 5 minutes-with a video game. They don&#39;t even have to be  <br/>\nthat boring or repetitive any more. Storm also has trouble with lights, movies,  <br/>\nt.v., movement, etc., and hand held video games work for him, as well. There <br/>\nare  games that help him fall asleep more quickly than others, I&#39;ve noticed, <br/>\nbut I  don&#39;t usually try to influence his choice of game at night. He&#39;s been <br/>\nplaying  them since he was between 18 months and 2 years old, and has gotten to <br/>\nthe point  in the month since he&#39;s turned 4, to where he&#39;s now handing me the <br/>\nGameboy,  saying, &quot;I&#39;m done.&quot; and turning over to fall asleep while I put it in <br/>\nthe basket  by our bed.<br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t know if it works for others, but it has been  *wonderful* for <br/>\ninducing sleep, here.<br/>\n <br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nDe<br/>\n**************Make your life easier with all your friends, email, and <br/>\nfavorite sites in one place.

He will act tired, even say he is tired and lie down. Within 5 minutes he&#39;ll <br/>\npop up again, and start jumping up and down. He has told me that he can&#39;t get his brain <br/>\nto shut down, and on another occasion that when it gets dark his brain turns on. This <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be a problem, except for he is so obviously tired, and the next day everything is <br/>\nharder for him. Things that normally wouldn&#39;t bother him send him into really hard crying.<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil about February we had bedtimes (we only discovered unschooling in late 2007), <br/>\nwhich sometimes led to 45 minutes of crying in bed before he would go to sleep. We never <br/>\nleft him alone, and it was pretty torturous for everybody involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince February it&#39;s been up and down, but with generally an easier time going to sleep. Just <br/>\nrecently I switched to working two nights a week (from three mornings), so I know that <br/>\nwe&#39;re going through a transition. He wants me all day, doesn&#39;t want me to leave his side, <br/>\neven to go get something to eat. The nights when I&#39;m not here he&#39;s fine, but on the other <br/>\nnights he&#39;s just had a really hard time winding down. The past few nights it&#39;s ended with <br/>\nboth of us in tears. Me just out of general tiredness and a lack of a few minutes to myself, <br/>\nand him because I won&#39;t do something he wants me to do, or because the show he wants <br/>\nto watch isn&#39;t on, or something like that. Then he&#39;ll cry for a few minutes until he goes to <br/>\nsleep. It seems to help him go to sleep -- I think because it stops his brain from whirring <br/>\naround if he&#39;s focussing on something else (this happens to me to, both my mom and I <br/>\nhave trouble going to sleep and staying asleep). But clearly this isn&#39;t what I want for our <br/>\nfamily.

We&#39;ve been driving around a couple of nights a week, but he doesn&#39;t always stay <br/>\nasleep when we bring him inside, and if he wakes up it extends his going to sleep by at <br/>\nleast an hour. When he has a baby if he slept for even five minutes in the car, it would <br/>\ndelay bedtime for about 45 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for us to get through this transition?
