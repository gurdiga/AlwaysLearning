It is<br/>\nobvious that you are deeply passionate about unschooling and really want to<br/>\ncontribute to other unschoolers, however from what I see happening, this<br/>\nisn&#39;t about juju topics. It&#39;s bigger and more comprehensive than that. It&#39;s<br/>\nabout attitude and communication.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been hopping around to unschooling groups online for a couple of years<br/>\nnow with the hope I would find support, encouragement, and inspiration.<br/>\nUnfortunately, the kind of support I have wanted has been difficult to find.<br/>\nMy family went out of town yesterday, so I thought I would continue the<br/>\nsearch and that is what has brought me here to join this group today. I see<br/>\nthat paranormal and seemingly unscientific concepts are up for examination.<br/>\nScience and spirituality/paranormal stuff are my lifelong passions, now<br/>\nperfectly converging with my unschooling path. So I am excited to comment<br/>\nand create some closure for myself about my frustration with these groups<br/>\nsince Abe-Hicks has been a big support for me, as well as the RU group, when<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t meet my needs elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, unschooling includes fostering free-thinking and yet I observe<br/>\nevaluations being made about this topic with criticism, sarcasm, and with<br/>\nsome resistance to exploring Abe-Hicks for understanding and clarity. I find<br/>\nit contradictory that &quot;seasoned&quot; unschoolers who claim they want to share<br/>\ntheir experience criticize certain unschoolers because of a particular<br/>\ninterest or passion they have. It appears we may have different<br/>\nunderstandings of free-thinking going on. One of the reasons I choose to<br/>\nunschool my kids is to foster a functioning concept of acceptance of all<br/>\npeople, regardless of what they think yet using discernment to know what is<br/>\nhealthy to allow in their lives. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI do not judge others who perceive Abe-Hicks differently from me, everyone&#39;s<br/>\nPOV is valid to me. For instance, this topic is providing me with the<br/>\ninspiration and opportunity to voice some things that are dear to me.    I<br/>\njust want to share my observations and provide feedback that given what some<br/>\npeople are implying they are trying to accomplish within these groups -<br/>\nnamely helping people- is getting lost in the translation. I am not pointing<br/>\nfingers at any particular people as I have ran into this with multiple<br/>\npeople on multiple groups. And since people can only determine if they are<br/>\nfulfilling their intentions by the feedback they get, I am tossing mine out<br/>\nfor clarity.  I also think there might be more people on these lists that<br/>\nmight resonate with my perception but are too discouraged to speak up. I<br/>\nhave no need to be liked by anybody in particular so I am happily willing to<br/>\nshare my POV that others might disagree with. It&#39;s all relative and it&#39;s all<br/>\ngood. I do think that there is an easier way to learn from each other rather<br/>\nthan out of conflict and defensiveness though. In fact, I thought that was<br/>\nsomething all unschoolers were basing their path on. And just for clarity&#39;s<br/>\nsake, I don&#39;t mean that everybody ought to see things the same way. I do<br/>\nthink that agreeing on one thing would be helpful to everybody - that simply<br/>\nbeing kindness and mindfulness.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy understanding of unschooling includes trust not judgment, joy not guilt,<br/>\nfun not dread, nurturance not indifference, open-mindedness not intolerance<br/>\n, individuality not conformity, friendship not competition, love not<br/>\ndisgust. We have chosen to create these positive elements in the lives of<br/>\nour children. But to what extent? Are we to model it or follow the parenting<br/>\nmodel of &quot;don&#39;t do what I do, do as I say.&quot; I want to be the kind of person<br/>\nI want my children to be - that means diligence on my part. Haven&#39;t we all<br/>\ndecided to do things differently from our parents? Aren&#39;t we trying to<br/>\naccelerate the process by consciously deciding to close that generational<br/>\ngap as much as possible? Isn&#39;t that the reason why deschooling is more<br/>\ncritical for the parents? Perhaps resocializing would be a better word. Not<br/>\njust because we went to school, but because the aspects of the school system<br/>\nunschoolers mutually deem as unworthy are the symptoms the organization<br/>\nbreeds - failing to meet the needs of individuals. And for me that includes<br/>\nboth the giving and receiving of acceptance. Division is superseded by more<br/>\ndivision. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe radical unschooling group is the only forum I have found so far that<br/>\nprovides those opportunities exclusively. I am thankful for that. It has<br/>\ndefinitely encouraged me to visualize/imagine and hence manifest more of<br/>\nwhat I was/am wanting in my life. Works for me since using one&#39;s imagination<br/>\nis fundamental in life because everything is birthed from thought.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was younger I used to talk to my dad about my interests and beliefs<br/>\nabout the &quot;higher power&quot; I believed in. I wanted so much to be understood by<br/>\nhim. However he was not as receptive as I hoped, as he was inundated with<br/>\nall of indoctrination  that his parents passed to him that contradicted what<br/>\nI was sharing with him. It was very painful to me that he resisted my POV<br/>\nbecause his support  meant a great deal to me, and I thought he did not<br/>\naccept me completely for who I was. I recall feeling nervous just thinking<br/>\nabout telling him that I didn&#39;t believe in his concept of god or any<br/>\nreligion even though my parents encouraged me to follow my gut, think for<br/>\nmyself, and disregard others&#39; opinions of me that didn&#39;t serve me -<br/>\nincluding theirs. So although I wasn&#39;t &quot;unschooled,&quot;  they gave me a<br/>\nprecious gift- especially since I enjoyed a lot of juju stuff! Now they seek<br/>\nanswers from me - another precious gift. They have embraced that our<br/>\nrelationship is a two way street. Sometimes when we think we know what is<br/>\nbest for someone&#39;s growth - we&#39;re wrong. I don&#39;t take that lightly when<br/>\nreaching out to people. It&#39;s like I tell my kids, you don&#39;t know if your are<br/>\nhelping unless someone tells you it would be helpful. So anyone please feel<br/>\nfree to tell me if this wasn&#39;t helpful to you so I can assess my approach<br/>\nand choose accordingly. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra, I&#39;m wondering why you brought this to the table for discussing. Are<br/>\nyou wanting empathy for your frustrations or to make it clear that you don&#39;t<br/>\napprove of exploring these types of topics on your list or something else?<br/>\nWould you be willing to clarify your intentions? <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nLoving life, living to love!<br/>\n<br/>\nStaci<br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.myspace.com/staci444\">http://www.myspace.com/staci444</a>&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.myspace.com/staci444\">http://www.myspace.com/staci444</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33648,"nextTopicId":33776}}
