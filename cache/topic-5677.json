UC Santa Cruz has an option where you<br/>\ncan create your own major.  A friend of mine is graduating this<br/>\nspring in her medieval history major.  I&#39;m not sure UC Berkeley<br/>\never had that option but at one point it was *the* hippie college<br/>\nand the hippie college town.  Evergreen College in Olympia WA is<br/>\nanother one where students are given more control over their education.<br/>\nUC Santa Cruz has been getting pressure to be like the other UCs lately<br/>\nso it is losing some of its hippie status IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nCindy Ferguson<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:crma@...\">crma@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":818735,"authorName":"Joylyn","from":"Joylyn &lt;joylyn@...&gt;","profile":"joylynrsf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] hippie colleges","postDate":"1016733331","msgId":5686,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDOUExRTkyLjZDRjJBNUExQGd0ZS5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDgxLjE5M2E5MjdkLjI5Y2I2ZjFjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5677,"nextInTopic":5710,"prevInTime":5685,"nextInTime":5687,"topicId":5677,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
