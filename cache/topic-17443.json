This is exactly what I was talking <br/>\nabout.  The children were marked, they were marked by one teacher and <br/>\ntheir marking was passed along to the other teachers.  So the child <br/>\ncould not be who he or she was, but in the eyes of the teachers the <br/>\nchild was marked.  <br/>\n<br/>\nToday in the district where I sub they do it differently.  In one <br/>\nschool where I subbed they hand you a clipboard first thing.  On the <br/>\nclipboard are the names of all the elementary children in your <br/>\nclass.  Next to their names are columns for each day of the week, <br/>\neach week of the marking period.  At the bottom of the sheet are 10 <br/>\nnumbered items, demerits, 10 things for which the teacher must write <br/>\na number if the child is caught doing these things.  If any child <br/>\ngets 4 or more demerits in a day he or she must go to &quot;detention&quot; <br/>\nafter school.  And if he or she gets 5 or more &quot;detentions&quot; in one <br/>\nmarking period then they are labeled as chronic problems and further <br/>\nsteps are taken to reprimand and punish them.  So now they are <br/>\nlabeled on little clipboards as &quot;bad&quot; kids for doing &quot;bad&quot; things.  <br/>\nOver 50% of the students in some classes go to &quot;detention.&quot;  Shows <br/>\nyou how well that system works!  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd just what are these terrible offenses that these elementary <br/>\nstudents are committing?  Talking.  Getting out of his or her seat.  <br/>\nGoing to the pencil sharpener.  Disobeying the teacher.  Leaving the <br/>\nroom without permission.  Not sitting quietly in his or her seat, <br/>\ndoing what they were told.  And so on.  Terrible offenses!!!!!  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband, a ten year veteran corrections officer in a state pen, <br/>\nsaid that the language was exactly that used in prison systems.  So <br/>\nthese children, from age 3 on (Head Start), are being labeled <br/>\nas &quot;bad,&quot; as offenders, as needing &quot;detention.&quot;  To me this makes the <br/>\nschools and the teachers recruiters and trainers for the FFA, the <br/>\nFuture Felons of America.  For if you tell children repeatedly how <br/>\nbad they are, they will surely someday prove you right.  By the way, <br/>\ndid I say that this particular school was 99% black?  I guess I <br/>\nforgot to mention that.  And then we wonder why so many end up in <br/>\njail or prison later?  I wonder how so many escape and manage to stay <br/>\nout of jail or prison.  I think it&#39;s amazing that only about 25% are <br/>\nincarcerated when far more have been programmed from a very early age <br/>\nfor that fate.<br/>\n<br/>\nSurely all schools are not like this, but even if only one is like <br/>\nthis, it is one too many.  And, sadly, I am sure that this is not the <br/>\nonly one.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNorma<br/>\n<br/>\nRewards and punishments are the lowest form of education.<br/>\n-Chuang-Tzu, philosopher (4th c.

Poor <br/>\nthing.   She hated pubescent boys.  Maybe one had attacked her one time.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s my best guess, but she would never in a million years have discussed it <br/>\nwith me.    I would trade her a smaller pre-pubescent boy for one of her <br/>\n&quot;trouble makers&quot; (meaning gotten-tall, voice-changed, hairy boys).   <br/>\n<br/>\nShe should have been teaching 7th grade instead of 9th, but there it was.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne kid was a bully and a liar.

He weasled and wiggled &quot;Did you SEE him light the <br/>\nlighter?&quot;  &quot;No, I saw him look around too see whether anyone was watching, stand <br/>\nfacing the door a bit, and walk away from a flaming poster, and he had the lighter <br/>\nin his pocket.&quot;    &quot;But you didn&#39;t see him set it on fire?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDumbass.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we laughed later, and said &quot;Well, that&#39;s where he gets it,&quot; and decided it <br/>\nwasn&#39;t going to be worth appealing to the dad to help us out if there were <br/>\nproblems.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut another thing I remember happening LOTS and lots of times was one of us <br/>\ntelling the other teachers about something we knew about a kid that the others <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know.  That his mom was in the hospital for a mental breakdown, or that <br/>\na girl had broken up with her boyfriend so we should give her a break for <br/>\nanother week or so, or that one kid who seemed mousy had done something <br/>\nbrilliant.
