What&#39;s <br/>\n  about my speed is the medium-level Spell or Starve on Neopets.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yes, I can spell, and yes I know a lot of words, but I use them in the real <br/>\n  ways they were intended, not in the artificial Scrabble-world.  So for one <br/>\n  thing, Scrabble doesn&#39;t teach spelling.  It rewards a very strange and otherwise <br/>\n  useless skill--take some random letters and see if you can shuffle them in your <br/>\n  head until you see a pattern.  Or KNOW the patterns and see what you can <br/>\n  make.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  You know what my kids liked MUCH better and seems similar as far as the <br/>\n  surface of what skill is being learned?   Hangman.   We have computer hangman, the <br/>\n  Ken Winograd game which you can download.  It&#39;s $15 or $10 but VERY much worth <br/>\n  it in our lives thusfar.  We had it on the oldest Mac and we have it on the <br/>\n  new one.  That can be played cooperatively or a child can play it on his own.  <br/>\n  There are definite liklihoods.  R is more likely than G, just in general, in <br/>\n  English.  But if you get a G at the end of a word it&#39;s worth guessing &quot;n&quot; or <br/>\n  &quot;i&quot; to see if it&#39;s an &quot;ing&quot; ending.  Kids will start to pick stuff up like that, <br/>\n  and if they&#39;re Scrabble-minded it will help with that eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\n  When my kids were little we had Ravensburger kids&#39; games.  They&#39;re way better <br/>\n  than the lame Candy Land kind of American stuff.  We got some of them from <br/>\n  Discovery Toys and others from hoity toy stores.  One of their favorites, still <br/>\n  played in the past few months by Holly and her friends, is &quot;Eureka,&quot; about <br/>\n  gold miners, and there&#39;s a little train as the &quot;timer.&quot;  Sometimes you roll the <br/>\n  train and it moves one space (it&#39;s a hex-grid board) and when the train gets to <br/>\n  town, you all count your gold.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  That game involves dice, but no numbers past five, and no reading.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Others we played which didn&#39;t involve reading were the &quot;first games&quot; (where <br/>\n  the dice were shapes or colors, not even numbers), Ghost Party/Midnight Party <br/>\n  (has been published twice with different names), The Squirrel game (harder to <br/>\n  do because the pieces are more fragile), and there are some other newer <br/>\n  Ravensburger kids&#39; games since my kids got older.  They&#39;re German, and people living <br/>\n  in Europe can get them more easily.<br/>\n<br/>\n  OH!!!  Labyrinth.  That&#39;s GOOD.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  A game collecting friend of mine has one (I think by that same company) that <br/>\n  involves trees (cardboard standup evergreens that go to the ground) and a <br/>\n  candle.  The candle moves, and you&#39;re elves or pixies or something and you can <br/>\n  only move in the shadow.  So there are literal shadowed spaces and light spaces, <br/>\n  which change when the candle is moved.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Doing something which is totally beyond a child&#39;s abilities will just <br/>\n  frustrate everyone involved.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I recommend the games Set (which kids can be really good at but adults can be <br/>\n  confused by) and Five Crowns, both by the same company.  Both card games, but <br/>\n  one is laying down cards and finding relationships, and the other is kind of <br/>\n  like rummy and gin, but not exactly.  Better.   <br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

Other people have the option to challenge you on it <br/>\nand then look it up in the dictionary.

I still remember the day when I was watching them<br/>\nplay and saw my brother going in for the checkmate, and I opened my mouth<br/>\nto say something to my grandpa (bad sportmanship, I know, but I was<br/>\nlittle and didn&#39;t think about that) and he looked up at me and winked,<br/>\nand it was clear he say my brother&#39;s plan and had decided to let him do<br/>\nit, to let him know. I felt really betrayed, like he&#39;d been lying to us<br/>\nfor years. Eventually my brother figured it out, too, and felt the same<br/>\nway - we never really knew if we were good at chess or not, because he<br/>\nalways let us win. So I never did that with Rain. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I did do, and still do sometimes, is handicap myself in certain<br/>\nways, and also offer her help at various times. Now she&#39;s not as<br/>\ncompetitive, we play tons of games but really just for fun, but at 5 and<br/>\n6 and 7 losing was hard...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe still haven&#39;t tried Scrabble - now it would probably work, but it&#39;s a<br/>\nlong game and harder to adapt to various levels. We do have a game called<br/>\nTuf-abet, which is out of print but available pretty cheap on ebay, and<br/>\nit&#39;s got the same wort of interlocking letters to make words ideas, but<br/>\nsince each player has their own letters you can adapt it pretty easily.<br/>\nRight now, all Rain needs is to be able to check with me on word spelling<br/>\nsometimes, but with a younger kid you could do lots of things - give him<br/>\nmore time, let him flip the letter cubes to find the letters he wants,<br/>\netc. We did play Boggle when Rain was younger, although not 5, and she<br/>\nwould get more time and was allowed to make words with any number of<br/>\nletters, whereas mine had to have at least 5 and there were no bonus<br/>\npoints for longer words until you hit 10 or so letters.... I love word<br/>\ngames..<br/>\n<br/>\nRain was usually okay with these sorts of changes - I did tell her I&#39;d<br/>\nbeen reading and writing for a lot longer than she had, and it helped<br/>\nwith these games. In golf, some players get a handicap, too. With some<br/>\ngames (Set, Frog Juice, Rat-a-Tat-Cat, Midnight Party, Slamwich) a 5 yr<br/>\nold can be just as good as an adult, or better, and I think it&#39;s good to<br/>\nplay games like that sometimes, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like this is about you, too - maybe you could get a handicap<br/>\nwhen you play certain games with DH? It would probably make the idea more<br/>\npalatable to your son, and if your husband is really good at word games<br/>\nand your not, it might level the playing field too... and maybe you need<br/>\nto find some things your good at, too - maybe word games just aren&#39;t your<br/>\nthing, but there are lots of other kinds of games...<br/>\n<br/>\nDar</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Scrabble w/ 5 yr old","postDate":"1066589072","msgId":16826,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYuMC4wLjIyLjAuMjAwMzEwMTkxMTQzMTEuMDI1OTc3NDBAc2hhd21haWwuZ3Yuc2hhd2NhYmxlLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDMxMDE5MTY0MDU0Ljc3OTAzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjYwMTA5Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwOTk1NDlDLTAyNEUtMTFEOC05MEUyLTAwMEE5NTY4QzVBRUBtYWMuY29tPiA8MjAwMzEwMTkxNjQwNTQuNzc5MDMucW1haWxAd2ViNjAxMDkubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":16823,"nextInTopic":16830,"prevInTime":16825,"nextInTime":16827,"topicId":16816,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

She<br/>\nhad seen some kids playing with a large, life-like chess set when we were<br/>\nin Seattle, and wanted to play too.  I did some research and found several<br/>\nplaces suggest that when the child is getting frustrated you exchange<br/>\nsides.  This way the adult never needs to hold back, you don&#39;t need to let<br/>\nthe child win, and often the child will see how to turn a bad situation<br/>\ninto a winning one by watching the adult begin to win with what appeared to<br/>\nbe the losing side.  At any time the child can switch sides, so technically<br/>\nthey could win every game by switching just before the checkmate.  However,<br/>\nI believe this is like assuming that a child will be lazy and do nothing if<br/>\nwe don&#39;t teach them.  From what I read, kids enjoy learning to play chess<br/>\nthis way, they stick with the game, and they don&#39;t need to win all of the<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother strategy that I read about is to play complicated games in steps so<br/>\nthey aren&#39;t so overwhelming.  For example, with chess you first play with<br/>\nonly the pawns, then when that game gets easy to add the knight, then keep<br/>\nadding pieces until you are playing with them all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think both of these strategies could be applied to most games, to make it<br/>\nfun for the adults and not so frustrating for the kids.  I don&#39;t know if it<br/>\nwould work with scrabble -- unless you were playing to keep score for the<br/>\nadults and just playing for the fun of making up words with your son.  My<br/>\ndd came up with her own scrabble game where she invents words and we have<br/>\nto pronounce them.

Or KNOW the patterns and see what you can <br/>\nmake.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou know what my kids liked MUCH better and seems similar as far as the <br/>\nsurface of what skill is being learned?   Hangman.   We have computer hangman, the <br/>\nKen Winograd game which you can download.  It&#39;s $15 or $10 but VERY much worth <br/>\nit in our lives thusfar.  We had it on the oldest Mac and we have it on the <br/>\nnew one.  That can be played cooperatively or a child can play it on his own.  <br/>\nThere are definite liklihoods.  R is more likely than G, just in general, in <br/>\nEnglish.  But if you get a G at the end of a word it&#39;s worth guessing &quot;n&quot; or <br/>\n&quot;i&quot; to see if it&#39;s an &quot;ing&quot; ending.  Kids will start to pick stuff up like that, <br/>\nand if they&#39;re Scrabble-minded it will help with that eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my kids were little we had Ravensburger kids&#39; games.  They&#39;re way better <br/>\nthan the lame Candy Land kind of American stuff.  We got some of them from <br/>\nDiscovery Toys and others from hoity toy stores.  One of their favorites, still <br/>\nplayed in the past few months by Holly and her friends, is &quot;Eureka,&quot; about <br/>\ngold miners, and there&#39;s a little train as the &quot;timer.&quot;  Sometimes you roll the <br/>\ntrain and it moves one space (it&#39;s a hex-grid board) and when the train gets to <br/>\ntown, you all count your gold.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat game involves dice, but no numbers past five, and no reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers we played which didn&#39;t involve reading were the &quot;first games&quot; (where <br/>\nthe dice were shapes or colors, not even numbers), Ghost Party/Midnight Party <br/>\n(has been published twice with different names), The Squirrel game (harder to <br/>\ndo because the pieces are more fragile), and there are some other newer <br/>\nRavensburger kids&#39; games since my kids got older.  They&#39;re German, and people living <br/>\nin Europe can get them more easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nOH!!!  Labyrinth.  That&#39;s GOOD.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA game collecting friend of mine has one (I think by that same company) that <br/>\ninvolves trees (cardboard standup evergreens that go to the ground) and a <br/>\ncandle.  The candle moves, and you&#39;re elves or pixies or something and you can <br/>\nonly move in the shadow.  So there are literal shadowed spaces and light spaces, <br/>\nwhich change when the candle is moved.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoing something which is totally beyond a child&#39;s abilities will just <br/>\nfrustrate everyone involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recommend the games Set (which kids can be really good at but adults can be <br/>\nconfused by) and Five Crowns, both by the same company.  Both card games, but <br/>\none is laying down cards and finding relationships, and the other is kind of <br/>\nlike rummy and gin, but not exactly.  Better.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":81962961,"authorName":"M. Dalrymple-Lepore","from":"&quot;M.

As DS doesn&#39;t know (or show knowledge) of a lot of <br/>\nwords right now, I was helping him.  I&#39;m not sure if that was a good <br/>\nidea or not, but that&#39;s what I did.  And we limited words to 5 letters. <br/>\n  I think I was aiming for a &quot;dog/pig/cat/sat&quot; game of Scrabble.  This <br/>\ndoes not require much on my part, as dog/cat/sat is normally what I can <br/>\ncome up with.  DH, however, commonly comes up with words like &quot;vaunt&quot; . <br/>\n. .  Which led to a discussion of how we want to do the whole game <br/>\nthing.  Like, it&#39;s not fun for DH if he has to hold himself back.  It&#39;s <br/>\nnot fun for me to lose, or see our child frustrated and sad because <br/>\nhe&#39;s losing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a child, my father always let me win . . . and I felt like I was too <br/>\nuseless to win something on my own.  OTOH, my mom never held back at <br/>\nall, and I felt like I&#39;d never be smart enough to challenge her.  And <br/>\nso very quickly I never wanted to play any games with my parents.  So I <br/>\nwant a middle ground.  But DH is concerned that we *tell* Steven &quot;do <br/>\nyour best&quot; but when it comes down to it, we hold back so that he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t lose by a huge margin.  I know very soon he will be winning on <br/>\nhis own, but in the meantime I am very afraid of screwing this up.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I know a lot of this stems from my own issues-- I feel stupid a <br/>\nlot, and get discouraged if I lose all the time.  And DH is very smart, <br/>\nthis stuff is easy for him . . .<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know.  This making sense to anyone?  Maybe Scrabble is just a <br/>\nbad game?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nMelanie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16999,"nextTopicId":17026}}
