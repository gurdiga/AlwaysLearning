And we had some fun doing the things Ma did.  We made butter out of cream, donuts and maple candy in snow.  We also tried washing clothes in a tub (they LOVED that and would occasionally do that for fun even years later)  and making little homemade toys.  It was really a lot of fun.  The other books were a bit tougher, their lives had some real dangers and difficulties and LIW was pretty opinionated about how people ought to behave.  I liked &quot;Farm Boy&quot; written about Almonzo&#39;s childhood on a farm back East for some of the same kinds of homey descriptions of life back then.  There are loads of picture books and recipe books for kids available based on the stories since they are so popular.  As we grew into the other books there were many discussions about the way children are treated then and now and about the relationships in the book.  I know many religious homeschoolers who would treat these books as fine examples of how children ought to behave etc.  I would avoid that... also &lt;spoiler&gt;  my kids were very upset when Jack, the Bulldog died.

She<br/>\nnoticed my tattoo (a zen enso, or painted circle) and asked about it and<br/>\nstarted talking about her Buddhist teacher. I asked if her teacher was<br/>\nTeijo Munnich, someone I had studied with for a time. I felt certain it<br/>\nwas, and she confirmed that it was! When I told her about my previous<br/>\nstudies, I was feeling a tiny bit guilty about not having as intense a<br/>\npractice as I once did. Then I remembered that as a radical unschooler,<br/>\nI&#39;ve chosen for connection with my guys to be my #1 priority, and<br/>\neverything else settles in after that, and the guilt vanished.<br/>\nConsciously choosing that priority really helps my other choices come<br/>\ninto focus.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe said our teacher had recently said, &quot;Real life is your practice -<br/>\nzazen&#39;s a vacation!&quot; (Zazen is zen meditation -- sitting.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it&#39;s true. Nothing has brought me back to THIS moment, again and<br/>\nagain, being present in a real way, as much as radical unschooling, and<br/>\nthe commitment I made to this way of life, to my boys.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of my childhood and other factors, I had to learn how to be here<br/>\nwith Evan and Seth, how to really connect, how to be present, not just<br/>\nphysically here. This journey has been amazing and full of gifts. I have<br/>\nno doubt that one day I&#39;ll take a ten-day silent retreat, but for now,<br/>\nour messy, sometimes loud, lives are plenty grist for the mill.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce, I was recently telling a friend how much I enjoyed fishing in<br/>\nAnimal Crossing - standing there, peacefully, with the sound of the<br/>\nwaves as accompaniment. Schuyler has written about finding a minute here<br/>\nand there to connect with yourself, rather than believing you need a big<br/>\nchunk of time away from your kids. Animal Crossing fishing provided me<br/>\nwith that minute AND connection with the guys.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe watch youtube videos together. With six years between the boys, it&#39;s<br/>\ngetting trickier to find shows or movies we can all enjoy together, but<br/>\nwe can spend lots of time on youtube, laughing together.<br/>\n<br/>\npeace,<br/>\nCaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;alma&quot; &lt;almadoing@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\nAn old friend of mine, a friend I met in a Thai monastery more than 20<br/>\nyears ago, and only see very infrequently, recently asked me how my<br/>\npractice was going these days.

Some kind of random at the end.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarl and I read books to Kathryn each night. Sometimes they were just  <br/>\nbooks, part of the ritual before bedtime. Sometimes, if they were  <br/>\nbooks we both loved that connected us, the time moved up several  <br/>\nnotches to spiritual.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery night for years and years, Carl has made chocolate milk at  <br/>\ndinner for Kathryn. But he delivers not just the chocolate milk but  <br/>\nthe gift of his appreciation of something she enjoys which connects  <br/>\nthem in the moment and with their shared past.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying games together, especially video games because those tend to  <br/>\nbe more personalizable and emotionally connecting.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarl and Kathryn have played Madden football together for years. All  <br/>\nthree of us played Animal Crossing. Oddly it&#39;s a one-player-at-a-time  <br/>\ngame. What was connecting was understanding the can&#39;t-be-explained- <br/>\nwith-words enjoyment and satisfaction of the activities. Like pulling  <br/>\nthe weeds that sprout up each night and fishing for the rare fish.  <br/>\nSounds dull written out. The pleasure can only be understood through  <br/>\nexperience. It&#39;s not only fun to do, but inexplicably enjoyable to  <br/>\nwatch others do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes the games we played together were just fun games. For me,  <br/>\nSuper Smash Brothers was just a fun game. Perhaps because I wasn&#39;t  <br/>\nvery good at it so couldn&#39;t experience the same feelings my daughter  <br/>\ncould. For a game to elevate to a connecting of spirits, there needs  <br/>\nto be not just shared enjoyment but a deeper shared understanding that  <br/>\nwe&#39;re having very similar feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nShared emotions -- when we&#39;re all feeling the same thing -- that leads  <br/>\nto synergy of emotion -- that extra you get when individuals share the  <br/>\nsame emotions -- connects us. (Which is probably why strangers can  <br/>\nfeel so strongly connected when they ride out a crisis together.) My  <br/>\nfamily and my sister went to Disney World and had a fun time. We  <br/>\nshared similar emotions. But the only connection I remember that rose  <br/>\nabove mutual enjoyment was the Jungle Cruise where the guides are a  <br/>\nbit irreverent of the Disney experience. We did that one 3 times. It  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t just more enjoyable but a synergy of joy. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe both greet Carl at the door, asking if he needs help bringing stuff  <br/>\nin from the car. It was never a requirement  for Kathryn to join me --  <br/>\nwhich might rouse negative emotions and associate them with his  <br/>\narrival. My attitude when he pulled in the drive was laced with  <br/>\npositive emotions, &quot;Oh, Daddy&#39;s home!&quot; And for her it connected with  <br/>\nher toddler-view of the world that already knew that was an awesome  <br/>\nthing and carried that on through the years. She&#39;s 19 and still thinks  <br/>\nit&#39;s awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not just a hi when he comes home. It&#39;s a mindful pause, a time to  <br/>\ngive full attention. Sometimes he walks in at an awkward moment in  <br/>\ndinner preparation but I&#39;m conscious that he and the connection are  <br/>\nmore important than dinner and do what I can to get to the connection  <br/>\nas soon as I can.<br/>\n<br/>\nCooking. Not all cooking is spiritual or mindful. Sometimes it&#39;s just  <br/>\nfood grabbed quickly or tossed in a pan to get dinner done as quickly  <br/>\nas possible. But it can elevate it to the spiritual when you connect  <br/>\nto your family -- and yourself too! -- with some extra attention that  <br/>\nsays they&#39;re worth the extra effort. It needn&#39;t be elaborate. It might  <br/>\nbe getting the top split hotdog buns instead of the side split. My  <br/>\nmother used to cut peanut butter and jelly sandwiches into 4 sticks, a  <br/>\ntriangle and a circle and assemble them into a person on a plate. A  <br/>\nHoHo (snack cake) connects me to my childhood. As a child I always  <br/>\nstripped the chocolate coating off to eat that first. Then sometimes  <br/>\nI&#39;d unroll it and nibble it that way. I showed my daughter how to do  <br/>\nthat and it gave her a small connection with my child-self.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra often points out that you get to choose whether to stir anger  <br/>\ninto the meal as you&#39;re cooking or joy. You can choose whether to  <br/>\nconnect or disconnect.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, of course, cooking can connect you to the earth when you think  <br/>\nabout a red pepper being a package of rain and sunshine from  <br/>\nCalifornia or the organic farm in the next town or the container  <br/>\ngarden on your porch.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cat was sitting on the washing machine next to the running dryer.  <br/>\nSince I know she likes the warmth of the dryer, I cleared the top of  <br/>\nthe dryer off for her and she moved over. The other cat loves dropping  <br/>\na pipe cleaner into their water bowl and fishing it back out again. If  <br/>\nI see it astray, I return it next to the bowl so it&#39;s handy for her to  <br/>\nplay with.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I remember to buy a birthday cake for Christmas eve dinner  <br/>\nand we sing Happy Birthday to Jesus. Since we&#39;re not Christian, it&#39;s a  <br/>\nconnection to the human being but the Catholic relatives enjoyed it  <br/>\ntoo and for them there was probably an added spiritual dimension.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecycling. You can choose to let the bulky annoyance aspect of  <br/>\nrecycling color your vision or see that each item diverted from the  <br/>\ntrash connects you with the earth through being a caretaker in a small  <br/>\nway.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnections with yourself. Like meditation. Cup of special tea that  <br/>\nyou sip with awareness. Buying that piece of pumpkin cheesecake  <br/>\nbecause you&#39;re worth it and worth the time to savor each bite :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nConnections with a stranger. Random act of kindness can connect you  <br/>\nwith the world when they&#39;re done anonymously. Just the thought you  <br/>\nmade someone somewhere smile. :-) Or when you stop and give someone a  <br/>\nmoment of your time to help them out, it&#39;s not just nice but there&#39;s a  <br/>\nconnection formed and you get back more than you give :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":359766467,"authorName":"gabby","from":"gabby &lt;grassgrazer@...&gt;","profile":"gwilkon","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Spiritual practices","postDate":"1289678008","msgId":58090,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGluPWpyQkhMV191XzFoUUxwcjBmM2FxdjIrUkdxNGVDZ091b2pXRUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDFFMDkwMkFEMUVFMzRBRDNCN0MzOTEwQzhCMTRCMEVCQGRvY2VudGVyLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDFFMDkwMkFEMUVFMzRBRDNCN0MzOTEwQzhCMTRCMEVCQGRvY2VudGVyLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":58083,"nextInTopic":58096,"prevInTime":58089,"nextInTime":58091,"topicId":58067,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello, Curious, what Little House are you talking about?
