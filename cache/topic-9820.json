We have a very small back garden<br/>\nhalf of which is taken up with one of those huge wood climbing<br/>\nstructures (one of our purchases because of homeschooling, so the kids<br/>\nhad a park in their back garden) and the other half is basically mud<br/>\nnow.  The boys are out pretty much every day now that it&#39;s cool (even<br/>\nwhen it was hot they are out there) looking for buried treasure.  DH has<br/>\na fit when they are out there because he gets to clean it all up.<br/>\nUsually mud ends up on all the walls, Zak turns on the hose and the<br/>\nentire back yard is flooded.  Personally I have no problem with this.  I<br/>\nput them on my back and carry them to the bath when they are done<br/>\n(leaving the clean up for DH of course)....<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m so glad to hear this is a &quot;normal&quot; thing for kids to do when they<br/>\nare unschooled.  I keep thinking I have to provide all kinds of things<br/>\nfor them to do and again that&#39;s about me not them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been talking about sending Zak to an alternative school.  He<br/>\nwent for 1 hour with me to visit the other day.  The school is an<br/>\nunschooling school with with other kids (some of who were in our home<br/>\nschooling group)...  He seemed to enjoy it and then casually in<br/>\nconversation last night (at 1am this morning actually) my husband<br/>\nannounces that when he was talking to Zak he asked him whether he liked<br/>\nthe idea of going to that school and he replied &quot;no I&#39;d rather be at<br/>\nhome otherwise I&#39;d really miss my family, even if I can do what I want<br/>\nto do there, I would miss mommy&quot;....<br/>\n<br/>\nNeedless to say this news at 1am from DH in casual conversation was<br/>\nsomething that I tossed and turned about all night.<br/>\n<br/>\nZak and I are off to see a Shakespeare play this afternoon, put on by<br/>\nour home schooling group.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am so conflicted about how to balance my work (have my own business<br/>\nfrom home) and unschooling the kids.
