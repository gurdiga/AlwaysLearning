I ran into this very thing at a conference<br/>\nearlier this year that left me disturbed.<br/>\n <br/>\nThere was a room full of board games and toys and video games that kids<br/>\ncould hang out in while parents attended the talks. My son was happy to hang<br/>\nout there and I was glad that this year I would get to attend more of the<br/>\nchats and hear the speakers! I usually took him to the room and helped him<br/>\nfind a friend to play with or most likely he would just sit down and start<br/>\nwatching some of the older kids play wii and say Bye Mom!<br/>\n <br/>\nHowever much I wanted to hear someone speak, I still had to make sure my son<br/>\nwas OK. It seemed many parents left their kids unattended in that room and<br/>\nit wasn&#39;t always hunky dory for everyone, especially the youngest kids. A<br/>\nfew times I was the only adult in the room and a group of younger kids<br/>\ncomplained to me that the older boys had been playing the games for hours<br/>\nwithout letting anyone else play. I watched for a while (I think the younger<br/>\nkids couldn&#39;t tell when the characters died, so if the players clicked fast<br/>\nit was easy to trick the younger ones into thinking the game just went on<br/>\nand it was never their turn) so when one round was over, before they could<br/>\nstart another or continue, I stopped them and asked the boys who were<br/>\nplaying if they could start a rotation to let some of the others play. Give<br/>\nmore kids a chance to play instead of just watching. They had been watching<br/>\nfor hours and all wanted a turn. I suggested one of them oversee the<br/>\nrotation, but there should be a line on each side (2 controllers, about 8-10<br/>\nkids), and when you die, you go to the end of the line. That seemed to work;<br/>\nthe older boys still got to play longer because they were better and didn&#39;t<br/>\ndie as fast, but now everyone seemed happy because at least they got a turn.<br/>\nI envisioned them making friends, but maybe none of them cared about that,<br/>\njust a turn!<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nBut here is the bigger problem we ran into. Damon (who at the time was 4 and<br/>\n11 months old and yes, already into legos) was upset because there was a kid<br/>\nguarding a pile of legos and not letting anyone else play. He had left the<br/>\nroom crying to me twice so I went in with him to mediate if necessary. I had<br/>\nassumed all things in the room were there for community sharing, so how<br/>\ncould one kid tell all the other kids they could not touch the legos? There<br/>\nwas no one there so we started building with the legos. Then a kid not much<br/>\nbigger than mine showed up and started yelling at him to get away from the<br/>\nlegos. He was frantic! I told him I thought that everything in this room was<br/>\nhere for everyone to share and he said NO! These are MY legos and I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to share them! Hmmm.... then why didn&#39;t he just keep them in his room<br/>\nand how did they get here? He said his mom dumped them here and won&#39;t let<br/>\nhim take them back! <br/>\n <br/>\nThen I understood what that was like from his perspective. He was afriad<br/>\nother kids were going to steal his legos and take them home, so he was<br/>\nsitting there guarding his stuff! (Seemed like something MY mom would have<br/>\ndone, NOT an unschooling mom, at least not without consulting with her son<br/>\nabout the purpose of dumping his toys in that room.) I said none of the kids<br/>\nwould take the legos home, they only wanted to sit and build while they were<br/>\nhere. Same for the board games, you play here, and leave it here. Then<br/>\nanother boy came along and since he already knew the lego owner, he was<br/>\nallowed to play. My son was still being told not to touch and said he wanted<br/>\nto leave. <br/>\n <br/>\nSo I tried to bond with and make peace with this child. I told him that<br/>\nthere were a lot of lego fans at the conference and he could make some new<br/>\nfriends by sharing his love of legos instead of scaring kids away. Then<br/>\nanother small boy sat down and his dad sat with him. It didn&#39;t take long to<br/>\nfigure out he was there to do what I was doing! It seemed his son (along<br/>\nwith mine and dozens of others) had been yelled at and told not to touch the<br/>\nlegos and had left the room crying at least twice. So there we all sat. I<br/>\nasked the boy his name and how old he was. He was 5, turning 6 in June. I<br/>\nsaid Damon&#39;s birthday is in June too. The boy asked how far away June was<br/>\nand I said it was coming soon, in just a few days, but June was 30 days long<br/>\nso his birthday could be soon or in a month. So we got all the other boys to<br/>\nsay their names and ages and of course they were all about the same age. And<br/>\nof course they all loved legos. I got them talking about Star Wars, another<br/>\nhit. Soon they were all talking and laughing. I felt good about helping them<br/>\nbecome friends. I made sure I told Damon that he could not take any of the<br/>\nlegos back to our room and the other boy seemed OK after that.<br/>\n <br/>\nI ended up missing a talk I had really wanted to hear, but this seemed more<br/>\nimportant. I found the boy&#39;s mother (SHE had gone to the talk! grrrrr) and<br/>\ntold her what had been going on for 2 days, that her son was making enemies<br/>\nand guarding his legos. Did she ask him if it was OK with him to dump his<br/>\nlegos in there? No. She said it was for his own good. I believe she thought<br/>\nit would help him make new friends, but she hadn&#39;t given it much thought<br/>\ninto how that might happen. She sure didn&#39;t sit in there and help! She also<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to hear about the other kids who had left crying (while I was<br/>\ntalking to the dad, several other kids walked in and saw all the kids<br/>\nplaying with legos and seeing adults there asked us if it was OK to play,<br/>\nsaying they had been told to go away before, and another mom told me the<br/>\nsame story about her daughter), she said that was life and kids had to<br/>\nfigure out how to work things out on their own. Like that&#39;s how things are<br/>\nin the real world or something. I felt like she was throwing her son to the<br/>\nwolves! She did the same sort of thing at the pool, she sat in the corner of<br/>\nthe patio chatting with another mom while both of them ignored their kids<br/>\nand any turmoil they were having (or causing!) in the water.<br/>\n <br/>\nI was just so shocked, I didn&#39;t know what to say to her or how to process<br/>\nwhat she did. I asked my friend J (you can chime in here if you want!) what<br/>\nshe thought of the situation. I was worried maybe there was something about<br/>\nunschooling that I didn&#39;t get, but she agreed with me that the mom should<br/>\nhave asked her son if he might like to share his legos. Or at least helped<br/>\nhim navigate the social aspects of the conference. He was only 5 for crying<br/>\nout loud!<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, I still think about that mom and son and wonder how they&#39;re doing.
