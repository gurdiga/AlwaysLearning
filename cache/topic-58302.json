It sounded more like manipulating a child to be ashamed of something that he was really liking, or to try to persuade him that it would make him need braces.  Two and a half year olds don&#39;t even have any permanent teeth.  And I doubt braces are about pacifiers, or playing trumpet, or any of the things that have been used to scare kids about their teeth being crooked.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNone of my kids used pacifiers, though I&#39;d&#39;ve been fine if they had.  I tried. :-) Kirby used to launch them out when he was a baby.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMarty and Holly had braced on their teeth without pacifiers or thumb sucking or playing the trumpet.  Those arguments are traditional manipulation, I think, and should be disregarded.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout this &quot;partner&quot;--if it&#39;s the parent of the child, that&#39;s &quot;his dad.&quot;   If it&#39;s not his dad, maybe put less power over the child in his hands.  But look for real reasons of health and safety, not the comfort of someone biologically unrelated to the child (or even someone biologically related, if their motives are personal and not for the child&#39;s own peace and happiness).    At least consider those factors when deciding whether you&#39;re getting warm or cold in your decision.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/choices\">http://sandradodd.com/choices</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":420540815,"authorName":"Mirjam","from":"&quot;Mirjam&quot; &lt;mirjamkoopmans@...&gt;","profile":"mirjam_met_adam","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Losing the dummy","postDate":"1291469564","msgId":58306,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlkZGZ0cyszdmVvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlkY21qbis1dDdpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58302,"nextInTopic":58312,"prevInTime":58305,"nextInTime":58307,"topicId":58302,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Keelie, I m 33 now and still sucking my thumb.

My partner is putting the pressure on to get rid of it, cold turkey. I have mixed feelings. I used to suck my thumb and it was a great source of comfort. I did end up wearing braces though. In fact I have a second brace on my bottom teeth now to re-recorrect them. <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I don&#39;t know how his neenaw will affect his teeth. I feel that the most respectful path is to let him make the decision about when to drop the neenaw. We&#39;ve been reading a book for over a year now about a monster that decides to get rid of his neenaw. He loves the book but that&#39;s as far as it goes at the moment.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure of the best way to explain to him why he might want to consider getting rid of it. I dislike the &#39;you&#39;re a big boy/ only babies have dummies&#39; argument. We went with a &#39;neenaw for naps&#39; campaign for a while to give him the neenaw for sleeping only. But even that didn&#39;t sit well with me - if he sucked his thumb he&#39;d be able to do it whenever he pleased. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo I talk to him about it or do I let it go and wait for him to decide on his own? <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, how do I keep my partner happy when I am not supporting his wish to get rid of the neenaw?  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, <br/>\nKeelie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58325,"nextTopicId":58276}}
