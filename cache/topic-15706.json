It&#39;s _Boy_ by Roald Dahl.  My boys and I are big Dahl fans and noticed this one at the library.  For those that are not familiar, it is a collection of stories that Roald remembers from his childhood.  It&#39;s not quite an autobiography....Dahl states in the beginning that an autobiography &quot;is usually full of all sorts of boring details.&quot;  And that he would never write a history of himself.  :o)  Some of the stories are funny, some sad and some just gross.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been reading it at night to my boys and they can never stop at one chapter...sometimes not even 2 or 3.  Last night we read about a surgery that Dahl had when he was 8 or 9 and my boys asked me to read that part 3 times!  They love the photos of Dahl and his siblings as children, the houses and schools (they were mortified by the idea of boarding school), pictures of Dahl&#39;s handwritten letters to his mother, etc.  We have even been caught looking at the large map on the wall at 11:00 at night...looking for Norway and England.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor anyone that is a Roald Dahl fan, this book is a must if you haven&#39;t already read it.  I would love to hear from anyone else that has read the stories.  It has sparked so many questions and conversations for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nNamaste,<br/>\nJen  :o)<br/>\nMom to Beck (7) and Dane (4)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15699,"nextTopicId":15695}}
