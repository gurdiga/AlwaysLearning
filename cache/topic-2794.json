I always said I thought it <br/>\nwas worth it, but I wasn&#39;t prepared to say that changing your whole mind <br/>\nset and life was easy either. For example, when someone said their <br/>\nhusband was totally against homeschooling, and what should they do, I&#39;d <br/>\ntry to help them find ways to talk him into agreeing to a trial for a <br/>\nyear, and ideas on what to do during that year to &#39;convert&#39; him. The <br/>\nothers would just tell her to ignore her husband, and he&#39;d &#39;get over <br/>\nit&#39;. Etc. etc. I was told I should shut up, that if people thought there <br/>\nwere negatives they wouldn&#39;t even try homeschooling. Must put a positive <br/>\nface on everything, and tell them that whatever they did would be <br/>\nlovely. And because everyone else was doing this, some new people got <br/>\nquite offended by what I was saying. But as the years went by, I have <br/>\nhad so many people say that the memory of me saying &#39;it&#39;s hard <br/>\nsometimes, but it is worth it&#39; was the only thing that stopped them <br/>\nsending their kids to school when they ran into a tough patch. They <br/>\nwould think of all the people who said how great and easy it all is, and <br/>\nfeel hopelessly inadequate. Then they&#39;d remember what I said, and know <br/>\nthat they weren&#39;t the only one ever to have doubts and hard times, and <br/>\nkeep on going. It has been good to get that feedback, but it must be <br/>\nnice to get the instant thanks all the time that the positive thinking <br/>\nbrigade get by dishing out only what people want to hear at the time.  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] This is wonderful","postDate":"1011372972","msgId":2798,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGEzLjIyMzUwNDUzLjI5NzlhZGFjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":2794,"nextInTopic":2802,"prevInTime":2797,"nextInTime":2799,"topicId":2794,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/18/02 7:42:37 AM, ddzimlew@juno.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-162043985\">In a message dated 1/18/02 7:42:37 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ddzimlew@...\">ddzimlew@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Helen compared your writing style and clarity to John Holt&#39;s, and I can<br/>\nsee that too.
