Nine years ago, <br/>\nwhen ds was a baby, dh and I went on vacation for a week, using a condo <br/>\nthat his dad had given us his timeshare for.  We were really poor and <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t afford to do anything, so we borrowed some board games from the <br/>\nmain office of the timeshare place.  We ended up getting totally <br/>\nobsessed with Monopoly and played it all day and half the night for six <br/>\ndays in a row!  We stopped only to eat, sleep, and tend to ds (who was <br/>\nyoung enough that he slept most of the time).  I  have never, before or <br/>\nsince, been so obsessed with a game.  We still laugh about it.  When my <br/>\nkids get obesessed with something, I try to figure out (just for my own <br/>\ncuriosity) what need they are meeting at that particular time with their <br/>\nobsession.  I still haven&#39;t figured out what need two 24-year-olds could <br/>\nhave met by doing nothing but playing Monopoly, but it was sure fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nLaurie in WA</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Elizabeth Hill","from":"Elizabeth Hill &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"fMyaxxKkCQeBEnYCj1Nj368TQCJPILZX3ZLD7kpf4TviYFrq6GWcPxfOuU-3i1ZHxIB6EjRTmnty2CDhWqQU9aOpZsBCIfNu3FZCwPwSfQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] fantasy gaming vs real challenges (was Re:  Expensive Gam...","postDate":"1006886252","msgId":53,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDMDNERDY5LjkzRUMyNUVDQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDExZi43ZGRiZTczLjI5MzQ4NjhlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":47,"nextInTopic":63,"prevInTime":52,"nextInTime":54,"topicId":26,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

As long as you don&#39;t get upset when people disagree with you! I mean, I disagreed with you about these kinds of games not being satisfying for the reasons you gave, but it made me think about how this is one of those things where there is something inherent in them that makes people always want more and more. And that is worth thinking about. It isn&#39;t the same as playing a game of checkers or a game of backgammon or even a game of Pictionary. There are all these things to BUY and keep on buying to add to your set. So, ongoing money expenditure is involved and that makes it different and worth spending some time thinking about. And - there is an obsessive quality to them -- that is absent in other kinds of games. I think THAT is the crux of the anxiety that parents sometimes feel -- it makes us uncomfortable when our kids are obsessive about anything.
