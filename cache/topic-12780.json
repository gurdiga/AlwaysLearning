Restaurant and bar and hot tub and <br/>\nlittle lounge areas all mixed in there in that open area with big tropical <br/>\nplants.<br/>\n<br/>\nUp on the second floor, where there was a balcony/hallway overlooking all <br/>\nthat, I met Ian&#39;s #1 and #1 children, young adults, and a son-in-law.  Very <br/>\nnice people.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I got to my room, 627, with a view of snow-covered flatness and a few <br/>\nbusinesses, but mostly bare prairie to the horizon, I realized I had not one <br/>\ndollar of Canadian money, and my tapes were being delivered the next morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuckily, I had half a sprite and half a bottle of orange juice in my pack, <br/>\nand a bunch of nuts and jerkey, so I wasn&#39;t going to starve.<br/>\n<br/>\nDownstairs was an ATM but it didn&#39;t deal in VISA, only Master Card.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings eventually worked out, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nFebruary 28, Friday I went to put my things near the conference rooms, and <br/>\nwent toward the restaurant.  Someone called me from up on the ramp, &quot;Mrs. <br/>\nDodd?&quot;   I almost didn&#39;t hear it because of the water and all.    I went back <br/>\nand it was a TV reporter who wanted to interview me.  So I went all the way <br/>\nback up to the ballroom.  She and the cameraman were especially friendly and <br/>\nopen, unlike what I was used to with dressed-up and officious and abrupt TV <br/>\npeople.  Very nice.  She asked me to summarize my opening talk, and asked me <br/>\na bit about homeschooling in general.  I asked when it would be on and she <br/>\nsaid that it was a local station, and the news repeated every hour, so if I <br/>\nturned it on at the top of any hour I&#39;d see it.  Except when the hockey game <br/>\nwas on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was the first speaker, at 1:00.  The announcements and greetings were after <br/>\nmy talk.  I had just sent Ian a list of all the talks I&#39;d ever done and he <br/>\nhad chosen some, so I was doing &quot;What Teachers Know that You Don&#39;t Know.&quot;  <br/>\nThere being no alternative, everyone who was already there was at that <br/>\npresentation, and I&#39;m not good with numbers, but I&#39;m thinking it was over 300 <br/>\npeople.  Very big group.  I&#39;ve never spoken to a larger group, I don&#39;t think. <br/>\n   That particular talk is better suited to a smaller group, but it worked <br/>\nout, and when I finished a bit early, I was really glad that there were a <br/>\ncouple of teachers in the audience who were willing to come to the audience <br/>\nmike and back up my assertion that most of what teachers learn isn&#39;t useful <br/>\nto homeschoolers anyway, being as it is mostly about group management, tests <br/>\nand measures, school politics and record keeping, and so forth.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a break after that, and I set up a table in the hall to sell tapes <br/>\nand Thinking Sticks.  I don&#39;t think I sold any that first session, but I did <br/>\ntalk to people without pause for the couple of hours between sessions, and I <br/>\nspoke at 4:30 on Unschooling.   The group was smaller, but still over 100.  <br/>\nMaybe 175 people?  (If anyone reading this was there and actually counted or <br/>\nis better at estimation, feel VERY free to correct my numbers.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat talk went really well and everybody got a Certificate of Empowerment, <br/>\nbut the photos of the kids didn&#39;t make it all the way around.  I brought them <br/>\nout again the next day, though, and also kept them out on the table for <br/>\npeople to see.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that I sat at the table some more, sold some tapes, and officers of the <br/>\ngroup gave me a Subway sandwich which was homey (foodwise) and friendly <br/>\n(because I didn&#39;t have to put my stuff away to go and eat).<br/>\n<br/>\nI had planned to go back to the room , put my foot up a while, and watch &quot;An <br/>\nAmerican in Canada,&quot; a sitcom which had been advertised the night before on <br/>\nTV.  And then, I figured, the hour would turn and I&#39;d see myself on TV, and <br/>\nthen I&#39;d venture back out and socialize.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sitcom, turns out, was the premier episode.  It involved a guy moving <br/>\nfrom Phoenix to Calgary to do the morning news show.  (I read later that it <br/>\nwas filmed in Toronto and that the actor playing the American was from <br/>\nToronto too, but that&#39;s okay.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the local channel 10, the hockey game was on.  Minor leagues, I think, <br/>\nlocal team, Saskatoon Blades, happy to have a guy who had grown up there <br/>\nhaving lately left some other team and come to play for them.  I&#39;d switch <br/>\nchannels, and read, and check back.  Next hour; game still on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI called home and talked to Kirby and Holly.  Keith and Marty had gone to see <br/>\nDaredevil.  I asked Kirby to e-mail two unschooling lists to say I was having <br/>\na good time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHour; hockey.<br/>\nHour; hockey commentary.  Discussion of the game, of other teams, of hockey, <br/>\nof the fund raiser involving tie-dyed jerseys on tie-dyed night (or <br/>\nsomething).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was 10:00 and I was getting sleepy, but forced myself to stay awake until <br/>\n11:00.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSaw myself on TV.  Also the president of the provincial group hosting the <br/>\nconference.  Her last name is Dodds.  She looked and sounded marvelous.  I <br/>\nsounded great, looked like a person who should REALLY get a haircut, wear <br/>\nmakeup and maybe lose 50 pounds before ever being on TV ever.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDecided 11:15 was too late to hobble downstairs and socialize, and my foot <br/>\nwas fat.  Went merrily to sleep in a big bed in a dark room all by myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarch 1, Saturday, went to breakfast.  Ended up sitting and talking to a <br/>\ncouple who had heard me the day before.  Another couple of moms had also <br/>\nasked if I wanted to sit with them, but they&#39;d already actually eaten, and <br/>\nthe young couple had a baby, so I told them getting to sit with a baby won <br/>\nout, and they totally understood.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went and sat with my tapes and sticks.  Sold quite a few.  Talked to lots <br/>\nof people.  Spoke twice in the afternoon,  Dwindling crowd, which was totally <br/>\nunderstandable, because the alternative talks were interesting and some <br/>\npeople had heard me already.  <br/>\nThe first talk was Having Confidence in Yourself, and was (naturally) also <br/>\nabout unschooling, but was pretty much the same outline as the article <br/>\n&quot;Disposable Checklists,&quot; because that&#39;s where that article came from.    Then <br/>\nI did the game &quot;That&#39;s Not Educational,&quot; and gave a prize for baggie twist <br/>\nties.   Only one person in there had not already heard me speak, and after a <br/>\nfew items thrown out to be shown to be educational, it just turned into <br/>\nquestions and answers and that was fine.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI had moved my sales table inside the room and had been selling things <br/>\nbetween talks, and sold some more after.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople had been wonderfully friendly and open and complimentary and <br/>\ncommunicative.  I had a GREAT  time talking to people.  Even those who were <br/>\ndisagreeing with me were really nice about it.  (&quot;Of course, they&#39;re <br/>\nCanadians,&quot; one person who wasn&#39;t born Canadian or American either one told <br/>\nme when I said that.)  But both attendees and organizers were thanking me for <br/>\nbeing so available between talks, and for being so down to earth and <br/>\nfriendly.  It made me feel really good.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen I packed up and went back to the room, having fulfilled my obligation.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I wasn&#39;t through.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA largish group of unschoolers had chosen not to attend the conference for <br/>\nsocio-political reasons.  I was sympathetic, because the New Mexico state <br/>\norganization totally broke down and dissolved when unschoolers ran the state <br/>\nconference one year.  We couldn&#39;t survive unless we let the Christians run <br/>\neverything, and they were unwilling to really share power and opportunity.  <br/>\nSo something at least vaguely similar was going on in Saskatoon.  Rather than <br/>\nask to be told the details I just said I would talk to the other faction as <br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps that wasn&#39;t wholly right and good, but Saskatoon&#39;s a long way off, <br/>\nand my personal motivation is to help people unschool more confidently and <br/>\npeacefully.  Yes, it would have been easier for me if they&#39;d just gone to the <br/>\nconference, but I do understand when groups split out over such philosophical <br/>\nissues.  And I had no contract saying I couldn&#39;t speak anywhere else.  So <br/>\nalthough it was unfair that the smaller group piggybacked (the word used by <br/>\nsomeone in the larger group when complaining lightly about it) on the <br/>\nconference, I didn&#39;t feel too guilty, because I had gone above and beyond <br/>\nwhat I had been paid to do.  Except for the evening waiting to see the news <br/>\nblurb, I had been fully available to anyone who wanted to talk to me, and had <br/>\ndone four presentations.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was fetched and taken to a Unitarian Church where there were desserts and <br/>\nmaybe 25 people.  Some had been at the conference as well.  That session just <br/>\nturned into me telling stories, which seemed okay.  There were some questions <br/>\nand answers about younger kids reading and writing, about older kids&#39; social <br/>\nstuff, about parents&#39; fears and the world changing.  I enjoyed it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I was privileged to stay in a guest bedroom which was a Barbie museum!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the morning, March 2, a breakfast buffet at a different hotel was attended <br/>\nby maybe (you&#39;d think I could count a group THIS small) fifteen people.   We <br/>\nlaughed and told stories and were philosophical and ate good food, and then I <br/>\nwas given a ride to the airport!<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo or three hours with a stop in Regina without changing planes.  Very white <br/>\nand cold.   Minneapolis for four hours of magazine reading.  I thought of <br/>\ncalling Susan Bundlie but I was afraid she&#39;d feel bad for not picking me up <br/>\nand I didn&#39;t really want to eat and I was almost too exhausted to think.  So <br/>\nI read about Ben Affleck and watched CNN news and kinda vegetated.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had been afraid customs would question me about the leftover tapes (though <br/>\nI&#39;d sold more than half of the hundred I had had copied in Canada).  I had <br/>\ntraded my sack of cash to someone with an American account for a check.  <br/>\nCanadians don&#39;t have $1 bills anymore.  $5 is the smallest, so selling things <br/>\nfor $8 and $15 nets a bunch of $2 and $1 coins.  But all customs cared about <br/>\nwas the egg decorating kit.  Juxtaposed with my necklace (a brass pierce-work <br/>\nplaque) it came to look like a knife in the x-rays, so my backpack was <br/>\nsearched.  They didn&#39;t care anything about my carefully documented tapes with <br/>\nthe shrinkwrap and the Canadian receipt.  Oh well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was met in Albuquerque by Keith and Holly, who had happy stories of the <br/>\nweekend. Nobody had told Keith I had called on Friday.  I had only brought <br/>\ngifts for Holly.  A Canada patch for her jean jacket which has lots of <br/>\npatches (and she did go to Ontario a few years ago), a girls&#39; magazine, a <br/>\nmath workbook (because she finished her Animaniacs workbook a couple of weeks <br/>\nago, and this one looked like the kind of geometrical and fractions stuff she <br/>\nlikes), and I gave her the egg decorating kit I had been given as a gift from <br/>\nthe unschooling group Saturday night.   Carol Narigon made and gave us a <br/>\ndecorated Easter egg and Holly had said she thought she could do that, but I <br/>\nsaid I didn&#39;t know how and special equipment was needed.  Tadaaa!  Special <br/>\nequipment and instructions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was just brain-tired for a couple of days after getting home.  I&#39;ve finally <br/>\ndone my laundry, but haven&#39;t yet put papers away.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople in Saskatchewan were very friendly.  I had a way better time than I <br/>\nthought i would have.  I was afraid I&#39;d be all alone surrounded by strangers, <br/>\nbut it never felt that way from the moment I saw Ian and Barbie at the <br/>\nairport.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12812,"nextTopicId":12774}}
