When my children were very young, 3 and under, I did work. I had a great job working for Martin Marietta, as an assistant to the head of a dept. My husband worked as a Programmer for the same company. At the time I was making very good money. I was able to put my girls in a &quot;great&quot; daycare, with a very good reputation. But as time went on, I saw more and more problems with it. Serious fighting with between kids, my youngest daughter getting sick, having an allergic reaction, and noone called me, and so on. So, my husband and I sat down one night, and talked about what we really wanted. I wanted to be a part of their lives. I didn&#39;t want to be like my mother, she worked all the time, we were raised by babysitters, and now I have vurtually no relationship with either of my parents. I loved my children more that I could imagine. The idea of not being with them was torture. So, we decided I would leave my job. As a result we found that we actually had more finances available, since I wasn&#39;t buying clothes for work, paying daycare, less doctor visits as the girls were healthier, less eating out as I was home more.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for homeschooling? That idea had never occured to me. I had never even heard of it. I didn&#39;t know that we could teach our own children... Sounds funny now. : )  My husband new about it, and &quot;informed&quot; me that we should do this. I wasn&#39;t sure I could teach my own child... I even enrolled her in Kindergarten. But I talked with other hs moms, who gently laughed at me when I told them I didn&#39;t think I could teach my own child. One mom, said, &quot;You seem to be doing good so far&quot;, then explained to me that, I had taught her to walk, talk, dress herself, and more... why couldn&#39;t I just continue. So I did it... And it was such a joy, I wouldn&#39;t change a thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Why is it that this choice is not the obvious choice? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people don&#39;t see their children as the woderful people they are. They don&#39;t see the joy that children bring to their lives. I had a mom tell me once, that she couldn&#39;t wait for kindergarten to start for her oldes child, she was looking forward to &quot;getting rid of him&quot; for the day. She spoke very badly about him. She told me how difficult he was, always wanting something, needing to eat first thing in the morning, wanting to play outside, asking for his crayons... and the list went on. I was completely shocked. This is so oposite for how I feel about my kids. It is just natural for me to love them. I wish I had the answer for why it isn&#39;t the most obvious choice... perhaps some parents don&#39;t &quot;love&quot; their children. Perhaps it is that some parents have children as a status symble.<br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":86585859,"authorName":"moonmeghan","from":"&quot;moonmeghan&quot; &lt;moonmeghan@...&gt;","profile":"moonmeghan","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Why do you unschool?","postDate":"1020923522","msgId":6788,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFiZDJxMis0cmY3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGFiOHVjbCs3Z250QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":6786,"nextInTopic":6791,"prevInTime":6787,"nextInTime":6789,"topicId":6716,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" wrote: So, what brought you to the decision that not only being with your ... you ...

It is this huge investment of self.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Okay.  I watched Frontier House a week ago, I guess.  For those of<br/>\n&gt; you who didn&#39;t see it one family who was voluntarily hauled off into<br/>\n&gt; the wilderness were relatively divorced from each other.  That is<br/>\n&gt; they spent very little time together.  By the end of their<br/>\n&gt; experience on &quot;the frontier&quot;, terminal though it was, they had grown<br/>\n&gt; much closer and spoke of enjoying each other quite a bit. When they<br/>\n&gt; got back to their real lives they abandoned much of what they had<br/>\n&gt; experienced on &quot;the frontier&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; See, I had expected that when you discovered the joys of spending<br/>\n&gt; time with each other it would be obvious that anything else was a<br/>\n&gt; less than experience.  But by three months post frontiering they<br/>\n&gt; were doing very little to embrace each other.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, what brought you to the decision that not only being with your<br/>\n&gt; children was more valuable than the potential cash and status you<br/>\n&gt; could earn in the workplace (even recognizing that when two parents<br/>\n&gt; are working outside of the home one income is almost entirely eaten<br/>\n&gt; up by the expenses that are incurred by working outside of the home,<br/>\n&gt; but that these children aer people who are able to voice their own<br/>\n&gt; opinions, recognize their own needs, and choose their own paths?<br/>\n&gt; Why is it that this choice is not the obvious choice?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know if I can answer these questions.

Kris<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Those are my parents you are talking about.  I believe<br/>\nthat my brother and I were status children, trophies<br/>\nif you will.  My parents were never very interested in<br/>\nspending time with us, in what our thoughts, feelings<br/>\nor dreams were.  They never had any parental<br/>\n&quot;hear-to-hearts&quot; with us or other examples of<br/>\ncloseness.  They were more concerned with what we<br/>\nwould achieve, what our &quot;potential&quot; was (as though we<br/>\nhad to earn their love and respect by proving<br/>\nourselves worthy by our status and income level later<br/>\nin life.)  Every personal or academic failure was<br/>\ntreated as a personal offense against them.  They lied<br/>\nto their peers to have more acceptable explanations<br/>\nfor our behaviors.  They threatened us with dire<br/>\nconsequences (like being kicked out or beaten) if we<br/>\ndid not meet their academic expectations.  Externally,<br/>\nthey were the stepford parents with the big, nice<br/>\nhouse, stay at home mom, professional dad and all the<br/>\ntrimmings of a successful life in the 80&#39;s. <br/>\nInternally they were dysfunctional, alcoholic,<br/>\ncodependent, abusive, guilt driven and manipulative.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo why do I unschool?  Why are my kids so important to<br/>\nme?  I think these are things that I came to<br/>\nunconsciously as a child and I could never concieve of<br/>\nbeing any other way.  Certainly I could never be what<br/>\nmy parents were to me.  I forcibly persued my own<br/>\nunschooling (without the labels for it) throughout my<br/>\neducation, more agressively after I was 14.  I never<br/>\nwant my children to feel pushed into the corner that I<br/>\nwas, or to feel unloved or unwanted.  I never want<br/>\nthem to feel that sting of knowing you are a<br/>\ndissappointment to your parents, or that they tell<br/>\ntheir friends lies about you so you&#39;ll sound more<br/>\nimpressive or under control.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have other reasons for Unschooling now, but it began<br/>\nthere.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

It<br/>\nmakes no sense to me that someone can see their jobs, financial status<br/>\nand/or &quot;stuff&quot; as more interesting than their own children.  It&#39;s a state<br/>\nof mind that I can&#39;t begin to understand, that leads me to believe that<br/>\nit&#39;s a difference that goes right to the core of a person.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also believe that a LOT of people have children because it&#39;s one of<br/>\nthose things you do to prove you are normal.  You get married, have a<br/>\nbaby and buy a house, thus we have all manner of surrogate parent<br/>\ninstitutions.<br/>\n<br/>\nKris<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!

It is this huge investment of self.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay.  I watched Frontier House a week ago, I guess.  For those of <br/>\nyou who didn&#39;t see it one family who was voluntarily hauled off into <br/>\nthe wilderness were relatively divorced from each other.  That is <br/>\nthey spent very little time together.  By the end of their <br/>\nexperience on &quot;the frontier&quot;, terminal though it was, they had grown <br/>\nmuch closer and spoke of enjoying each other quite a bit. When they <br/>\ngot back to their real lives they abandoned much of what they had <br/>\nexperienced on &quot;the frontier&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSee, I had expected that when you discovered the joys of spending <br/>\ntime with each other it would be obvious that anything else was a <br/>\nless than experience.  But by three months post frontiering they <br/>\nwere doing very little to embrace each other.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what brought you to the decision that not only being with your <br/>\nchildren was more valuable than the potential cash and status you <br/>\ncould earn in the workplace (even recognizing that when two parents <br/>\nare working outside of the home one income is almost entirely eaten <br/>\nup by the expenses that are incurred by working outside of the home, <br/>\nbut that these children aer people who are able to voice their own <br/>\nopinions, recognize their own needs, and choose their own paths?  <br/>\nWhy is it that this choice is not the obvious choice?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if I can answer these questions.  So, maybe it is <br/>\nabsurd to ask others before I really explore my own choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6749,"nextTopicId":6719}}
