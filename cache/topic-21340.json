I remember when i was in elem. school the kids <br/>\nsinging beautiful renditions of &quot;Silent Night&quot;, or even newer songs <br/>\nlike &quot;Up on the Roof Top&quot; (dont know if thats the real name of the <br/>\nsong)...but i only recognized one song (&quot;We Wish You A Merry <br/>\nChristmas&quot;)from my niece&#39;s program. I wouldve thought that they <br/>\nexcluded any religious songs to be more &quot;inclusive&quot; (although based <br/>\nupon where we live i bet nearly 100 percent of the kids do celebrate <br/>\nXmas in one form or another)...but they also included what they <br/>\ncalled &quot;an old time spiritual&quot; that had a religious theme. It seems <br/>\nthere was a culteral literacy or something that wasnt being passed <br/>\non, and the whole thing seemed kinda sad to me, to have these kids <br/>\nsinging newly made-up songs with little meaning, to a prerecorded <br/>\ntape (that had other, recorded kids singing on it as well), when <br/>\nthere is such a rich history of holiday music around that couldve <br/>\nbeen used.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey did have a harp player there, which was kind of nice and not <br/>\nsomething i am used to seeing. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKatherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Christmas thoughts","postDate":"1103389394","msgId":21340,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1Ni40NmFkNWEyYS4yZWY1YmNkMkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":21341,"prevInTime":21339,"nextInTime":21341,"topicId":21340,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"One of the songs on Clay Aiken s Christmas album was new to me.

I looked up a couple of other renditions, but  I didn&#39;t like them <br/>\nbetter.

This is a good example.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not the literal meaning of the words of &quot;Mary did you Know&quot; that <br/>\ninspires me, it&#39;s the spiritual/emotional concept of God being born perfectly new <br/>\nagain every year.  (Other religions have annual renewal moments too.)  And I&#39;m <br/>\ntouched by such ideas surrounding the relationship between a mother and child in <br/>\nany context.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow should a mother treat a child? How should a father be?<br/>\nChristians should treat others as they would treat Jesus.  That&#39;s pretty <br/>\nclear in the Bible.  So shouldn&#39;t every baby be treated as though he were the baby <br/>\nJesus?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about those who aren&#39;t Christian?  Isn&#39;t each child a new potential?  A <br/>\ndawn?  The start of an unforeseen adventure in which the mother is a <br/>\nsupporting character and not the hero?<br/>\n<br/>\nEven atheists see the moment of shining perfection in a birth.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe better we handle the trust given us by a child, the better people we are, <br/>\nand the better the child&#39;s young life, adulthood and old age will be.  We&#39;re <br/>\nnot just dealing with little children.  We&#39;re dealing with the whole of life <br/>\nitself, which will outlast us all.
