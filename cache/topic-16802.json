Paying half our income in taxes makes people think there are no other viable options.

Give back all those tax dollars that are thrown away on inhumane institutions and you&#39;d see lots of new ideas springing up everywhere.  Demand creates supply.  Refunded tax dollars would cover a lot of user fees - enough to defray the cost to families who can&#39;t afford them.  <br/>\n <br/>\nTaxpayers have no real say in how the tax dollars are spent; consumers do.

They school them to confuse process and<br/>\nsubstance. Once these become blurred, a new logic is assumed: the<br/>\nmore treatment there is, the better are the results; or, escalation<br/>\nleads to success. The pupil is thereby &quot;schooled&quot; to confuse teaching<br/>\nwith learning, grade advancement with education, a diploma with<br/>\ncompetence, and fluency with the ability to say something new. His<br/>\nimagination is &quot;schooled&quot; to accept service in place of value.<br/>\nMedical treatment is mistaken for health care, social work for the<br/>\nimprovement of community life, police protection for safety, military<br/>\npoise for national security, the rat race for productive work.<br/>\nHealth, learning, dignity, independence, and creative endeavour are<br/>\ndefined as little more than the performance of the institutions which<br/>\nclaim to serve these ends, and their improvement is made to depend on<br/>\nallocating more resources to the management of hospitals, schools,<br/>\nand other agencies in question.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIvan Illich - Deschooling Society (1973: 9)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can read the whole of Deschooling Society here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ecotopia.com/webpress/deschooling.htm\">http://www.ecotopia.com/webpress/deschooling.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNorma </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":162247422,"authorName":"Julie","from":"&quot;Julie&quot; &lt;jlist@...&gt;","profile":"julesmiel","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: &quot;super teachers&quot;","postDate":"1066598912","msgId":16840,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMWQwMWMzOTY4NyRmM2FkYTI2MCQ3MTJhNGI0M0BvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PGJtdWlvYis0ZWxpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16825,"nextInTopic":16841,"prevInTime":16839,"nextInTime":16841,"topicId":16802,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Norma wrote: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1983879451\">Norma wrote:<br/>\n&lt;&lt;What you have said sounds very <br/>\nmuch like one of my favorite Ivan Illich quotes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;A good educational system should have three purposes: it should <br/>\nprovide all who want to learn with access to available resources at <br/>\nanytime in their lives; empower all who want to share what they know <br/>\nto find those who want to learn it from them; and finally, furnish <br/>\nall who want to present an issue to the public with the opportunity to make their challenge known.&quot; - Ivan Illich <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s Ivan Illich of Deschooling Society.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFunny you should mention Ivan Illich and Deschooling Society, Norma.

Being that she worked at a school in the city, there was a good mix of students (spanish, white, african american, etc.).  I remember asking her why she didn&#39;t work in one of the schools in the town she lived in (southern r.i.).  She told me that she likes working in the city because the majority of the students&#39; parents were non-english speaking and didn&#39;t really know their children&#39;s rights in school, i.e. if one of the children needed extra support or services and how to go about obtaining those services.  She said that she does not want to have to deal with parents such as myself who know their children&#39;s rights and would attend iep meetings, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause the kids in her class spoke english as a second language, they sometime struggled and she would tell me that the work they generated was nothing but garbage.  I just could not believe what I was hearing!  On top of it, she would be surprised when the pricipal would check up on her and the other teachers would complain about her teaching.  She was shocked when letters of reprimand were placed in file.

Will making it easier for educated professionals to become teachers do the trick? Gov. Tim Pawlenty, in a multipronged initiative announced Wednesday, said he is willing to give it a go.<br/>\n<br/>\nMinnesota students still are among the tops in the country on test scores, but the achievement gap between black and white students is among the widest.

And it&#39;s not the teachers&#39; fault and it&#39;s not the principals&#39; fault. But those are the outcomes, and they&#39;re failing.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe governor&#39;s plan would pump millions in additional money into a handful of pilot projects around the state to see if basing teachers&#39; pay on their students&#39; performance pays off.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first and perhaps most dramatic part of the plan would be to create &quot;super teachers&quot; at five Minnesota schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrincipals of those schools would have sweeping authority to recruit, hire and fire teachers outside of normal union contracts and tenure rules, Pawlenty said. In exchange, teachers at those schools would be eligible for bonuses of $20,000 to $40,000, based on their performance and student achievement. The program, which would cost $2.5 million to $5 million in new funding per year, would target those schools that serve large numbers of disadvantaged students and have struggled to raise test scores.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnder this program, Pawlenty said, &quot;All the rules are off as to who&#39;s working there. And in exchange for your coming, you have a shot to make $100,000.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPawlenty said he recognizes that parents play the biggest role in student achievement and that many struggling schools suffer from high student poverty and low parental involvement. But teachers play the next biggest part in student achievement, he said.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy creating the five &quot;super teacher&quot; sites, schools can attract the sharpest teachers to work with the most struggling students. Schools with poor outcomes are working to improve, he said, &quot;But they&#39;re nibbling around the edges and not making a big difference.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen asked if he thought teachers unions might oppose giving principals the authority to essentially start from scratch at those schools, Pawlenty said, &quot;This is a way to demonstrate whether by paying teachers more -- in some cases dramatically more -- that we can retain the best and the brightest to benefit children. How could you be opposed to that?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMoney and more <br/>\n<br/>\nOther aspects of the initiative:<br/>\n<br/>\n. Attract new teachers. Make it easier for professionals from other fields, particularly math and science, to get into teaching. The state Department of Education would create an alternate licensing program to streamline and shorten the training period that educated professionals would need to enter the classroom. The department would have the power to accredit alternate training programs. Officials said the state also will begin issuing report cards on how well private and public universities train teachers for the classroom.<br/>\n<br/>\n. Retain good teachers. Establish a new pay-for-performance program at seven pilot schools that would reward teachers with bonuses based on increased student achievement. The state would use $7.8 million in federal grant money to fund this program, as well as create an online database of lesson plans for teachers and develop a mentor program to support new teachers. The plan would also guarantee that teachers are assigned to classrooms before the start of the school year and prohibit interschool transfers during the year.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;super teachers&quot; and pay-for-performance pilot projects would be in addition to a current alternative compensation pilot program at five sites around the state. Education Commissioner Cheri Pierson Yecke said having three different projects going at 17 sites across Minnesota will give officials the kind of data they need to study how compensation affects student performance.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It will be a good, rich pool for evaluation,&quot; Yecke said.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut state Rep. Mindy Greiling, DFL-Roseville, called the money for alternative compensation &quot;chump change&quot; when compared to the $180 million that was cut from education funding last year.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I think it&#39;s trying to camouflage what&#39;s really going on in the schools,&quot; she said, noting that more than 75 Minnesota school districts are proposing excess-levy referendums to make up for state funding they lost in the last legislative session. While Greiling said the &quot;super teacher&quot; program is interesting, there certainly are more than five Minnesota schools facing huge challenges.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopes for support <br/>\n<br/>\nState Rep. Barb Sykora, R-Deephaven, chairwoman of the House education policy committee, said she thinks the Legislature will support the plan as a way to study what really makes a difference for students.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The bottom line is: We&#39;re here to educate kids,&quot; she said. She said she hopes the teachers unions see this as an opportunity for their members to grow.<br/>\n<br/>\nJudy Schaubach, president of Education Minnesota, said the teachers union shares the governor&#39;s goals of getting more teachers and getting them into the most challenged schools. And they share a desire to improve compensation, she said.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But there are a lot of issues that need to be talked through,&quot; she said, including just what it means to be a &quot;super teacher.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, while getting professionals to become teachers is a good goal, Schaubach said, &quot;We feel strongly that we not lower our standards. We&#39;ll do a disservice to kids if we don&#39;t ensure that teachers have the best preparation.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPawlenty said the &quot;super teacher&quot; program, which would be among the first in the nation, will be a bold step toward closing the achievement gap between disadvantaged and minority students and white students in Minnesota. Arguments for increased overall education funding miss the mark, he said. The gap has been widening over the past 10 years, regardless of how much money schools are spending.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe pointed at Minneapolis as an example.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe district, he said, spends more than $10,000 per pupil per year. Yet the district&#39;s four-year graduation rate was 46 percent -- and just 26 percent for black students.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Those outcomes are unacceptable,&quot; he said.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave Heistad, director of testing, evaluation and student information for the Minneapolis schools, disputed the governor&#39;s data. Under new federal rules, he said Minneapolis&#39; four-year graduation rate in 2002 was 57 percent -- 78 percent when counting just the students who attend the city&#39;s seven regular high schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile the governor said that he understands that the Minneapolis schools cannot control the poverty of their families or the readiness of their new students to learn, focusing funding on results could have a dramatic effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the pilot projects work, Pawlenty said, &quot;I think it opens the door to the whole discussion about how we pay teachers.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJames Walsh is at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jwalsh@...\">jwalsh@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16913,"nextTopicId":16963}}
