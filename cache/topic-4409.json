Huh? <br/>\nJust buy old stuff!  LOL  I am not surprised about<br/>\npeople in the bay area paying a lot of money for new<br/>\nfurniture made to look old.  They pay a lot of money<br/>\nfor EVERYTHING, housing, parking, food.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the only thing in San Francisco that is NOT<br/>\nreally expensive is good ethnic resturant food.  You<br/>\ncan find expensive places, sure, but the quality at<br/>\ncheapo mom and pop places is inceredible.  There is<br/>\ntoo much competition for high prices.  Growing up<br/>\nthere really spoiled me about eating out.  I still<br/>\nlove to eat out, but am slowly learning (through<br/>\ndisillusionment) that most places are just not worth<br/>\nthe money.  I can make better food at home.  I can<br/>\nfind cheaper distressed furniture at swap meets, flea<br/>\nmarkets and second hand stores too....<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend FREE Valentine eCards with Yahoo!
