I told her what I knew off the top of my head (and briefly) about a belief that at one time over 100 years ago, there was some sort of voodoo drug that would make people seem dead but still be alive, or that could be used to enslave people, but I thought even that might not be really true, and the other stories had grown from that.

But as Sandra pointed out a parents reliability and credibility is not going to last long if she can&#39;t tell the truth. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a fact that a garden gnome cannot come to life.  Neither can a bird bath or a fence post.  Why not say so, if asked?   <br/>\n<br/>\nI know there are people who think that if a thing can&#39;t be entirely disproved there is some possibility, however small, that it might be true.

So learning is swirling around, in and out of fact and fiction and the gray area that is &quot;history&quot; - and there&#39;s a Lot of that gray area in Egypt! There&#39;s a lot of &quot;no-one really knows for sure, but...&quot;. A lot of wondering to be done. And, at the same time, there&#39;s a chance to see how wondering fades into true fiction. I&#39;m not pretending that maybe there used to be dragons in Egypt - but knowing that part is pretend doesn&#39;t make the stories less fun, or the people we&#39;re reading about less wonderful. It doesn&#39;t automatically make the world smaller to say a fantasy isn&#39;t real - it can make our human capacity for imagining all the more miraculous. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] To make them fit...","postDate":"1298224361","msgId":59909,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGluUUZ3YTRKSDV0d0F4V09qTWtvU1oxWm9RQVZjMURGc1dGX3JOTUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDM4NUQ5NDgyLUJBNDUtNEUxNi1CREJGLTcyQkQ0ODRCMDgxRUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGlqcXN1bCtndGJwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8NTBFRTg4MzYtOUJGQS00MUU5LTlBQkQtOTM1RUFDNTRCNUM1QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPgk8QUFOTGtUaW1yK2pvdmdMZmp6YytMdUstaThfcD1BVD04blAyY3FaUVNvMUFnQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgk8Mzg1RDk0ODItQkE0NS00RTE2LUJEQkYtNzJCRDQ4NEIwODFFQHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":59907,"nextInTopic":59910,"prevInTime":59908,"nextInTime":59910,"topicId":59891,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I can quasi-believe a lot of stuff for the wonder and fun of it.

Great for you. But who made you an authority on such<br/>\na topic? You&#39;re an influence in unschooling. To some an authority. But<br/>\nthere&#39;s a big world out there, and just because YOU have not interacted with<br/>\na gnome, or a fey, or whatever doesn&#39;t mean it does not exist nor does it<br/>\nnot have a place in another families scope of unschooling. I&#39;m understanding<br/>\nhere that this is a lifestyle. If I choose to unschool, I will not be<br/>\nextracting my belief, from experience, of creatures such as this in the<br/>\nlives my my children. They are free to choose what to believe... and<br/>\nsometimes it actually  does take the experience to believe... but I digress.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe these things have no place in your world, but they have a place in<br/>\nother peoples worlds.

And Sandra - I doubt she was talking<br/>\nabout garden statuary as you so snidely commented.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I can explore unschooling elsewhere. Maybe a gnome will leave a<br/>\nwebpage open when I&#39;m not looking. Or drop a book onto my path. Scoff if you<br/>\nlike. That&#39;s fine.
