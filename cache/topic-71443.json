Lots of great ways to play with fire!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, this all really helped me rethink how I was parenting. As she has gotten a little older, I started establishing rules without even realizing it. She&#39;s exploring more, but still much too young for long explanations, so I was taking the easy way out. It didn&#39;t seem like it, I just thought I was keeping her safe, but the responses helped me realize that it will be much better in the long run if I support her in her interests instead of thwarting them and relegating those activities to a time or place out of my presence.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again!<br/>\n<br/>\nlove, sarah<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71442,"nextTopicId":71402}}
