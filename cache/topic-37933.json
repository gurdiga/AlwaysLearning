Pre-school daycare can be quite expensive and in the UK that is why they now are introducing these measures for assessing daycares. You assess a school by it&#39;s product which is an educated child. You assess education with testing. So you test infants and toddlers at daycare. <br/>\nI&#39;m lucky and I&#39;m willing to take the hit, I don&#39;t work. We live without my income. If we needed my income I would work really, really hard to find ways to earn money while still having Simon and Linnaea at home. But I balk the system in that regard. For most people being able to put your children in state-funded daycare is a very good thing. I suppose having a school open to earlier age children takes away some of the stigma of not paying for childcare, using welfare based childcare. Maybe not. It probably, also, helps those who are marginally not on welfare. <br/>\n<br/>\n------snip--------<br/>\nI did not even have kindergarten available when I went to school in 1968 in Illinois - I started with first grade, had mixed grade levels because we were such a small school, stayed in the same school through 8th grade and did just fine. ;)<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\nThe economy was very different in 1968. In 1968, the year I was born, my mom didn&#39;t work. She went to school fulltime when I was 5, so 1973. My next door neighbor, who was a nurse, but was also around a lot of the time, so must not have been working, babysat for me until second grade, when I think mom was at home more and taking the bus to and from school delayed my homecoming long enough for me not to be home alone much. And even so, I went to preschool for 2 years before school. I can distinctly remember 3 different locations for the preschools, so maybe even 3 years of preschool, or 1 year of daycare and 2 years of preschool. <br/>\nIt isn&#39;t about you doing fine with less school. I think it is more about balancing the needs of so many people being in the workforce. It is not seen as a public good to have mothers or fathers be at home with their children during their childhood. There is lots of lovely data demonstrating that having a parent at home is a really good thing for children, but the data doesn&#39;t have the same impact as the GDP does, I imagine. And, of course, there is also data demonstrating that children in early learning programs are more precocious. Of course being precocial is not necessarily a good thing, but it looks good to achieve learning landmarks early. Certainly when you are testing for outcome. <br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;unschooling&quot; very young children","postDate":"1220716936","msgId":37965,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZDNTgwMDQ3LTk4MDctNDMwQi1BNjM1LUM0RjYwMjE5MTFCM0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDlmNzJkNzYyMDgwOTA1MjM1Mm5kYmVjN2VjZzJkODc5MjQ2ZDhkMDBkNDdAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDBDNzU0RkNGLTQzMzItNDdFQi1CNjlDLThEOEQ5M0JDMjk3RUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDlmNzJkNzYyMDgwOTA1MjM1Mm5kYmVjN2VjZzJkODc5MjQ2ZDhkMDBkNDdAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":37964,"nextInTopic":37966,"prevInTime":37964,"nextInTime":37966,"topicId":37933,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-.

DD was probably 1.5 when we discovered unschooling but it<br/>\nprobably took me another year or so to soak in radical unschooling and<br/>\nwant to do all of it.  That was probably when I really started to<br/>\nthink of myself as an unschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne reason I think that we are unschoolers is that when I decided to<br/>\nbe an unschooler, it changed the way I did things.  We were gentle<br/>\nparents to begin with, but when I decided that I wanted to unschool,<br/>\nthings got even better.  When DD was really young, we didn&#39;t watch TV<br/>\naround her and it wasn&#39;t until she was 2 that I started putting movies<br/>\non for her (all in spanish).  We didn&#39;t limit it to a certain amount<br/>\nof time and I don&#39;t remember saying no... but I also didn&#39;t offer it<br/>\nand she was 2 so it really was a limit.  I started to get more<br/>\ncomfortable with TV and now it is something that I don&#39;t have any<br/>\nnegativity about: our netflix account is largely for the kids and I<br/>\nactively try to find things that  they might like and introduce them<br/>\nto new things (or more episodes of old favorites).  I would not have<br/>\nintroduced them to Spongebob and they love that show.  I would not<br/>\nhave bought them toys, puzzles or scooters with pictures of their<br/>\nfavorite TV characters.  I would probably have pushed much much more<br/>\nacademically instead of trusting, helping and enjoying being with my<br/>\nkids.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt didn&#39;t change much of anything that I did with DS when he was an<br/>\ninfant... although I didn&#39;t go nuts with alphabet letters in the bath<br/>\nwhen he was 1.5 like I did w/dd.  Unschooling ideas weren&#39;t really<br/>\nrelevant very early on, but they certainly started to matter well<br/>\nbefore my kids were school aged.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as learning things goes, knowing that we were unschooling made<br/>\nme realize that this was how my kids were going to learn things so I<br/>\ngot better about following up on their interests.  I started doing a<br/>\nbetter job of making books, movies, websites, trips etc. available<br/>\nwhen they were asking questions and expressing interest in things.  I<br/>\nalso started working harder to think of things that might be<br/>\ninteresting and offer them  It helped me make my home richer and<br/>\nhappier than it would have been otherwise.  I don&#39;t think we would<br/>\nhave our elaborate art table and wonderful projects piled up over the<br/>\nhouse.  It wouldn&#39;t have occurred to me to introduce ds to the wii and<br/>\nI would not have been as excited as I am when he learned how to play.<br/>\nHe even beat the boss of the game he plays (which isn&#39;t meant to be a<br/>\nkids game) - I love to watch him and to play with him.  A friend of<br/>\nmine who is pushing her son very hard academically seemed to think it<br/>\nwas stupid and a non-achievement.... the thought that it could have<br/>\nbeen me looking down on this amazing stuff he is doing is really sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yeah, I can see that the issues that I am dealing with are not the<br/>\nsame as the issues that someone with older kids deals with... but<br/>\nunschooling is not just an absence of structured schooling. I&#39;m not<br/>\njust sitting her not going to preschool;  I am really DOING something<br/>\nhere.  Unschooling philosophy has been permeating our lives for<br/>\nseveral years and what I do every day is different because of it.  I<br/>\nam better at it than I was when I started and I hope that by the time<br/>\nmy kids are old enough to be &quot;real&quot; unschoolers that I will be even<br/>\nbetter at it than I am now.  I think the parenting stuff that goes<br/>\nwith unschooling is vitally important and I don&#39;t see how academic<br/>\nonly unschooling can really work... if the parents are being<br/>\ncontrolling about other aspects of the child&#39;s life do they really<br/>\nthink that the child isn&#39;t going to resist learning academic things<br/>\nthat they know their parents think are one of the few worthwhile ways<br/>\nto spend their time?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 5 years will I think that what I did w/my dd at age 3 was<br/>\nunschooling?  Yeah, I think I will.

I used to unschool our two kids but as they grew up,<br/>\n&gt; particularly at age 7ish, I felt this need to provide an official<br/>\n&gt; education for them - you know, reading, writing, arithmetic - and so<br/>\n&gt; we homeschool now. I know a bunch of unschoolers and I&#39;ve read a<br/>\n&gt; bunch of blogs about it, and it seems like most unschooling parents<br/>\n&gt; have kids that are 8 and under. I&#39;ll be pretty curious about your<br/>\n&gt; educational choices when your girls are older…. truthfully I doubt<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;ll be the same. It seems like a lot of people drop out of the<br/>\n&gt; unschooling ways as their kids grow. I mean there comes a point…. are<br/>\n&gt; you hear to guide your kids, or are you just going to let them figure<br/>\n&gt; it all out themselves? Do you make your kids brush their teeth, or is<br/>\n&gt; that a choice they get to make too? Do you let them watch hours and<br/>\n&gt; hours of TV full of ads they think are truth (because they are<br/>\n&gt; innocent)? When do you say no, that is not safe! ? Instread of asking<br/>\n&gt; them if it feels safe. I strongly believe that kids need boundaries,<br/>\n&gt; they need guidance, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;That said, I did agree with a lot of your post, especially about<br/>\n&gt; parenting like there is no tomorrow. And I actually do think<br/>\n&gt; unschooling is a great way to learn, it&#39;s how I learn, and when my<br/>\n&gt; kids are in their teens and they have a foundation of a great<br/>\n&gt; education and skills, then we will make this transition. It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; actually a family goal, to give our kids the foundation they need to<br/>\n&gt; be autodidacts.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So will that family say, in the long run, that they are unschoolers,<br/>\n&gt; and that their kids were unschooled, because they unschooled before<br/>\n&gt; they were seven and when they were teens?  If so, how do people<br/>\n&gt; distinguish between that and people who REALLY DO unschool instead of<br/>\n&gt; sending their kids to school, and instead of school at home?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is not to say that I don&#39;t think the principles of unschooling<br/>\n&gt; and attachment parenting don&#39;t work with babies.  That&#39;s where<br/>\n&gt; attachment parenting comes from! I just don&#39;t think someone who<br/>\n&gt; &quot;lets&quot; a baby or two year old learn naturally has a lot to brag<br/>\n&gt; about, as courage and innovation go.  So maybe it&#39;s that I don&#39;t like<br/>\n&gt; someone saying, &quot;Oh yes, we&#39;ve unschooled for five years&quot; and then<br/>\n&gt; sending their kid to first grade.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

People who think you&#39;re quirky <br/>\nor even a little crazy for going against cultural norms think you&#39;re <br/>\nnegligent and maybe even criminal if you opt out of statutory <br/>\neducation. <br/>\n<br/>\nI might still call my kid an unschooler even though he&#39;s no longer <br/>\ncompelled by law to go to school because he might otherwise have been <br/>\nin school until he&#39;s eighteen.

Maybe there&#39;s a <br/>\nwhole group of unschooling parents out there who think my kid can&#39;t <br/>\npossibly be and unschooler anymore. <br/>\n<br/>\nI might want to say &quot;Unschooler!&quot; because other sixteen year old kids <br/>\nwho are not in school are &quot;drop outs.&quot;   But &#39;round here, unschooler <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean anything to anyone. &lt;g&gt;  It only means something to <br/>\nother unschoolers.

I would agree that calling us unschoolers was mostly about me finding<br/>\nmy place, immersing myself in the idea, fully embracing it, and becoming<br/>\nmore and more confident in my stance. I can¹t imagine any other way now.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, after reading Holt¹s ³Learning All the Time² I did become even more<br/>\nadamant that I would not partake in or allow any type of preschool drill or<br/>\nquizing. To allow it could have planted the seed in my dd¹s head that she<br/>\ncouldn¹t learn w/o someone else directing her. In our schooly and<br/>\nrule-driven world, I wanted to watch myself so I could keep her intact in<br/>\ntrusting herself. And, yes, she is the type who would have been a grand<br/>\nfollower (I see her get spunkier every day, though, as she comes into<br/>\nherself more and more.). So, I think unschooling does actually happen early,<br/>\nnot just in theory, and serve a purpose. It is more than simply attentive<br/>\nparenting. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe the distinction is in how one really is at their core and if they plan<br/>\nto not allow themselves to choose school (or the other structures that would<br/>\nfall under radical unschooling). If they truly believed and lived the<br/>\nfreedom while the kids were whatever age, they are unschoolers (as school<br/>\nper my argument begins as early as our society says it does  6mo. here, not<br/>\nby law but by availability and expectation).

We have Early Childhood and Family<br/>\nEducation (ECFE) here in Minnesota. The mainstream view is that we are soooo<br/>\nfortunate to have these services (fee-based on a sliding scale) for our kids<br/>\nand should be taking every advantage of them! ³How could you not want to<br/>\ngive them every opportunity?² ;P I did attend when we first moved here when<br/>\nmy oldest (now 5) was 1 to check it out. I was w/ her in the class. What it<br/>\nwas early indoctrination of rules, shuffling from one activity to another,<br/>\nand preschool drilling; did I mention she was 1? Needless to say, we ended<br/>\nup ECFE drop outs. It also got her registered in the district¹s system. They<br/>\ncalled this spring out of the blue to see why we hadn¹t attended the<br/>\nkindergarten open house. Um, I¹m not required to tell you anything until<br/>\ncompulsory age of 7 here in MN.<br/>\n<br/>\nOutside of that, the pressure to preschool was ever-present. EVERY one of<br/>\nthe mainstream mommas I chatted w/ at playdates or while watching dd¹s<br/>\ncreative dance class, talked about their child¹s wonderful<br/>\npreschool(part-time daycare) experience. Again, ³How could I not have her in<br/>\npreschool?², they¹d wonder. I¹d say we were planning on homeschooling so<br/>\nthere was no need to prepare her for school. That got some odd looks. Then<br/>\nwould come the, ³Oh, I could never do that [homeschool].² Well, they may not<br/>\nbe able to do that. They¹ve bought into the idea that someone else has to<br/>\nformally instruct their child from birth or their little one won¹t succeed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was only by attending homeschool park days and lists such as this and<br/>\nAlwaysUnschooled that I could find people who lived what I saw as the way I<br/>\nwanted us to live and do live. -- Though there was this one mother who said<br/>\nshe had to leave the homeschooling gathering early so she her 2 y.o. twins<br/>\ncould finish their homework before lunch. She was completely serious. I<br/>\ncertainly felt like an unschooler then. -- And I do consider us<br/>\n³unschoolers² and have since I first read Holt when dd was 6wks old. Okay,<br/>\nmaybe at 6wks, I did say in my head we would unschool, but I can¹t clearly<br/>\nsay when I switched over to using the present tense; I¹m guessing during<br/>\nECFE. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I see it as a semantics issue, and prefer ³universal, lifelong learners²<br/>\nfor every member of my family. It¹s just so much more liberating to me. What<br/>\nothers call us doesn¹t really concern me. It used to bother me more if<br/>\nsomeone called themselves an unschooler and it didn¹t match my definition <br/>\nmuch like if they called themselves a vegetarian but ate fish. Now, it<br/>\ndoesn¹t concern me so much. I just focus on my little world and what brings<br/>\nus joy. I see how from a list owners perspective, though, the goal would be<br/>\nto present the philosophy in as clear form as possible so newcomers aren¹t<br/>\nconfused.<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy in MN<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 9/5/08 9:52 AM, &quot;laura g&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lalow@...\">lalow@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; My 4 kids are 3 to 6 (almost 7).

I think the reason more and more people think of themselves as unschoolers when their kids are not even school age is the growing tendency in this county to feel you need to purposely teach even preschool stuff.  I am on a forum where several people posted pictures of their kids (3 and 4 year olds) all ready to start &quot;preschool at home&quot;.  Some people even stretch these things to gross motor skill in babies by enrolling them in baby gymnastics classes etc...   So they say they are unschoolers to let people know that no they dont sit down and follow a schedule and have a curriculum for their preschoolers.  But at some point they loose faith or see that in actuallity they are glad even to follow these principles as long as their kid looks &quot;advanced&quot; but when the kids stop learning the things they think they should be learning &quot;like reading or skip counting&quot;  they feel a need to run to a curriculum.  <br/>\nAt this point I dont think of myself as unschooling my kids.  I just kind of think of it as getting through the day as happy as we can.  <br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet more out of the Web.

We haven&#39;t learned that<br/>\nkind of respect in the families we grew up in.  So *now* we&#39;re in dire need<br/>\nfor such things.  Otherwise unschooling will be a complete wash, and the<br/>\nlast thing I want is for Karl&#39;s childhood to be a wash.
