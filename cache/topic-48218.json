I&#39;ve done Elimination Communication with all<br/>\nthree of my kids, and been a moderator on that list, so basically spent<br/>\nabout 6 years listening to parents and potty talk. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my oldest, he wasn&#39;t able to explain to me what the problem was; if he<br/>\nwas afraid/nervous about the toilet, if actually pooping was painful... I<br/>\nnever did find out what the cause of the problem was. So it&#39;s kind of just a<br/>\nmatter of trying everything until it works. And frankly, I&#39;m not convinced<br/>\nthat it isn&#39;t just something they outgrow as their organs change size and<br/>\nshape and get different muscle development around them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a couple different potentials going on here. You don&#39;t say how old<br/>\nshe is, but IME, a bunch of kids go through a stage where sitting to potty<br/>\nis uncomfortable, and they&#39;d far rather stand, so you could enable that by<br/>\nletting her go on an easily cleanable surface (like in the bathtub), helping<br/>\nher to stand/squat on the toilet seat rather than sitting, or getting her a<br/>\nlittle potty (like the Baby Bjorn one), and letting her stand/squat over<br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes privacy is an issue. You might think about letting her hide out,<br/>\nor providing her with curtains or whatever. A lot of moms I know discovered<br/>\nthat the holding stopped once they ran curtains around a little potty.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it&#39;s dietary. Check fiber, check hydration. IME, lots of parents<br/>\nhave discovered that the constipating nature of dairy products is a<br/>\nshowstopper, and it&#39;s worth it to eliminate them for a while. I&#39;ve heard the<br/>\ngummy bear thing, I&#39;ve also had spectacular luck with dried fruit,<br/>\nespecially things like dried cherries, apricots, and prunes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bath thing is wise, although it hits a point once the child is old<br/>\nenough that they know that pooping in a bath isn&#39;t great, where it doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwork any more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe #1 most important thing, though (and it&#39;s so cool to say this on this<br/>\nlist, where I don&#39;t need to back it up!) is to stay relaxed and groovy, and<br/>\nnot put too much emotional baggage on it. It&#39;s a thing to work through, as<br/>\npartners. A lot of parents really freak out about potty issues, but really,<br/>\nit&#39;s just a stage like any other.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~L!<br/>\n<br/>\ns/v Excellent Adventure<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theexcellentadventure.com/\">http://www.theexcellentadventure.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWe are so programmed by other people’s programming which is programming by<br/>\nother people’s programming that we are on autopilot and we ourselves can’t<br/>\nsee through our own stuff. ~~ Nwenna Kai<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":241904499,"authorName":"zurro","from":"&quot;zurro&quot; &lt;zurrolaur@...&gt;","profile":"zurrolaur","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Poop Holding Issues","postDate":"1257084132","msgId":48231,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhjazRkNCttaG12QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhjaGJuNyt2bDRuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48230,"nextInTopic":48244,"prevInTime":48230,"nextInTime":48232,"topicId":48218,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks for the suggestions!
