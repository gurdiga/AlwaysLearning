Then<br/>\nagain, there was incredible comfort in the repetition. It was a boon that it<br/>\nwas also the very thing that brought great joy to my toddlers :D<br/>\nIt&#39;s a challenge, a tough one. I&#39;d tell you, over tea and cookies, that<br/>\nunconventional is what you got and unconventional is what you&#39;re gonna have<br/>\nto seek to live there comfortably and joyfully.  It&#39;s like that poem, you<br/>\ngot Holland instead of Italy. Me too. And I love my life.<br/>\nIt is possible & it&#39;s not at all gonna look like what you thought it would.<br/>\nThe secret is in keeping your focus on what&#39;s here and now. Embracing this<br/>\nuncharted territory.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe in relationship, find what works for who your son IS right now, what<br/>\nengages him and brings him joy. Provide lots of that. Over and over. To his<br/>\nheart&#39;s content. When the heart is content the mind is open. He&#39;ll learn in<br/>\nhis very own way exactly what he needs to know. Trust is *so* important.<br/>\nWhat you do matters. How you feel about what you do matters. Even, perhaps<br/>\nespecially, if you&#39;re the only one who will remember.<br/>\n~diana :)<br/>\nxoxoxoxo<br/>\nhannahbearski.blogspot.com<br/>\nhannahsashes.blogspot.com<br/>\ndianas365.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, Dec 30, 2008 at 4:30 AM, joancaptain &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joan45@...\">joan45@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;m a home educator whose son was diagnosed and treated for a brain<br/>\n&gt; tumour in 2006.

There are many times that there are cool<br/>\nopportunities to learn things and expand on things, not to be confused<br/>\nwith teachable moments.

The only time I learn new things in art is when I get<br/>\nbored of what I&#39;m comfortable with.  Comfort is a good thing, comfort<br/>\nallows for an open mind.
