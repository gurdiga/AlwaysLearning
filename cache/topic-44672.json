I&#39;m really trying<br/>\nto just jump in feet first, but it&#39;s been harder than I thought to get my<br/>\nidea of &quot;learning&quot; out of my head. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI just pulled my kids out of ps in 2009, so they did part of the year (most)<br/>\nin ps. I&#39;m thinking that between now and the summer months, we will shift<br/>\nmore away from &quot;curriculum&quot; and more towards learning through living. in<br/>\nwhich case it *really* won&#39;t matter what grade they&#39;re &quot;in&quot; next year. it<br/>\nwould be very irrelevant. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with my 6th grader (daughter) is that she wants to go back to<br/>\npublic school for high school. While I haven&#39;t told her yes or no, I&#39;ve<br/>\nactually told her we&#39;ll just talk about it when the time comes, she has this<br/>\nidea that she needs to prepare herself for highschool. that if she doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&quot;learn&quot; something that the state of CA says she needs to learn in middle<br/>\nschool that she&#39;ll somehow be behind in highschool. She is an extremely<br/>\nbright girl, picks up on things very quickly, and is ahead of where she<br/>\n&quot;should&quot; be were she in public school. She enjoys doing her math curriculum,<br/>\nso I&#39;m just going to keep letting her do that, and take breaks on days she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t feel like it. Language arts is learned through everyday<br/>\ncommunication and story writing that we do, although she is doing a language<br/>\narts workbook right now to &quot;make her feel better&quot;.

I use those grades<br/>\nloosely, as I&#39;m not sure grade I&#39;ll &quot;classify&quot; my younger 2 next year for<br/>\nvarious reasons. or if I&#39;ll even classify them at all. We tend to do most<br/>\nthings together anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI just pulled them from public school this year. my younger 2 in February<br/>\nand my oldest in March, so we&#39;re still trying to figure out our learning<br/>\nstyle and what works for us. My younger kids are having NO problem figuring<br/>\nout what they like and what they don&#39;t. we attempted physics for science,<br/>\nand they show no interest and have made it very clear that they want to<br/>\nlearn about the solar system. great! We&#39;ll start reading and doing fun<br/>\nactivities this week! They love to play math games. love to work with<br/>\nmanipulatives. can&#39;t stand doing worksheets! My 2nd grader announced to me<br/>\nlast week, &quot;Mom, I *hate* doing worksheets. they&#39;re so boring!&quot; Wow! I had<br/>\nto step back and rethink what we were doing. I was really doing &quot;school at<br/>\nhome&quot;, and while I&#39;m not completely ready to jump into unschooling (although<br/>\nI absolutely love the idea and can&#39;t promise I won&#39;t eventually), I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant my kids hating what we do or being bored. if they&#39;re not happy, it&#39;s<br/>\nobviously not working for them. My 3rd grader is quick to tell me, &quot;Mom,<br/>\nthis is just like public school. What&#39;s the point of being at home if this<br/>\nis what you want us to do?&quot; BACK UP! Don&#39;t want this to be like public<br/>\nschool, so obviously need to make some changes. Anyway, my point is we&#39;re<br/>\nfiguring it out, I&#39;m learning to get out of the public school mentality, and<br/>\nmy younger two are great at telling me what they like/don&#39;t like, what they<br/>\nwant to learn, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 6th grader is the one who is having a harder time getting into the<br/>\nmindset of being at home, I guess. It was her choice to stay home (I left it<br/>\nup to her so that she would be &quot;on board&quot;). but she is so stuck in the<br/>\npublic school mentality, it is unreal! I guess that is to be expected since<br/>\nshe spent the most time in ps. She has this idea of what her workload is<br/>\nsupposed to look like, and if she doesn&#39;t feel like I assigned her enough<br/>\nwork, she&#39;ll say she doesn&#39;t think she is learning enough. I try to explain<br/>\nto her that it shouldn&#39;t take her from 8:15 to 2:45 to do her schoolwork. we<br/>\ndon&#39; t have all the downtime and busy work that they do in ps. She&#39;s happy<br/>\nwith her math (she&#39;s doing Teaching Textbooks pre-algebra and really enjoys<br/>\nit). she hates reading, so I&#39;m working on that with her slowly. don&#39;t want<br/>\nto force her, but I think reading is very important. I just got us a book to<br/>\nread together, so we&#39;ll see how that goes. I don&#39;t push spelling much with<br/>\nher, as she&#39;s a naturally good speller anyway. Science and social studies<br/>\nare our issues, really. I found a unit study on veterinary medicine,<br/>\nparticularly dogs. she absolutely loves dogs, and I thought she&#39;d really<br/>\nenjoy it. When I mentioned it to her, she said, &quot;Mom, that&#39;s not the kind of<br/>\nscience I&#39;m supposed to be learning.&quot; Ugh. just when I think I&#39;m getting<br/>\nthrough to her. I tried to explain to her that there is no science you are<br/>\n&quot;supposed&quot; to learn.. that kids in ps have to learn whatever science the<br/>\nteacher is teaching, but that&#39;s just because the school system has to keep<br/>\nthem all doing the same thing to make it easier to teach that many kids, but<br/>\nthat she&#39;s home and has the opportunity to learn about what she wants. She<br/>\njust keeps saying that she needs to learn the kind of science that she&#39;s<br/>\nsupposed to learn in ps. and the same with social studies/history. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHow do I help her learn to follow her interests and that she has the freedom<br/>\nto learn about things that interest her? I ordered some games for my younger<br/>\ntwo about the solar system. and ended up getting one about anatomy, just<br/>\nbecause it looked fun! J So I&#39;m hoping she&#39;ll jump in on those games with us<br/>\ninstead of having her nose in the textbooks. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone has experience in &quot;deschooling&quot; their middle schooler, please<br/>\noffer some advice. I&#39;m honestly sad for her, and want her to find the love<br/>\nin learning again (probably since she was 5). I don&#39;t want to take away her<br/>\nmath program that she&#39;s using, and we&#39;re fairly happy with her language arts<br/>\ncurriculum (I&#39;m very loose there), but there&#39;s so much fun to be had if she<br/>\ncould just get &quot;unbrainwashed&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any help you can offer, and sorry for the long post!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44715,"nextTopicId":44727}}
