Unfortunately, there&#39;s no party to go  <br/>\nto, but they&#39;re going to go hang out with friends and maybe visit  <br/>\nother friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty made a pair of 3D classes.  We had real ones, but he wanted  <br/>\nsomething more substantial.  He asked if we had colored plastic, and  <br/>\nI did have a packet of colored plastic folders, like the kind people  <br/>\nput sets of papers in into a file cabinet.  He was happy, and I was  <br/>\nhappy to be able to open a drawer and produce the thing.  But the red  <br/>\nwas kind of orange.  So I went into my filing cabinet, into some  <br/>\nyears when I was using such things, and traded his out for a redder one.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe used cardstock from a carton and painted it white.  It took a few  <br/>\ncoats because he used the printed side.  I asked why he didn&#39;t turn  <br/>\nit inside, but there were two good reasons  The existing folds fit  <br/>\nhis face, and he worked on those, and he wanted them to look good  <br/>\ninside and outside.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had suggested he make two layers and glue them so the &quot;lenses&quot;  <br/>\nwould be held in like a frame, but he really wanted the plastic to be  <br/>\nfastened.   &quot;Will Elmer&#39;s glue work?&quot;  No, I said.  Then a few hours  <br/>\nlater I remembered suddenly how I used to glue wall paper samples as  <br/>\ncovers on the dictionaries I used as textbooks when I taught Jr.  <br/>\nHigh.  The covers were glossy and the glue wouldn&#39;t stick, so I put  <br/>\nmasking tape strips on the edges and the glue would stick to the  <br/>\ninside of the vinyl wallpaper and to the outside of the masking  <br/>\ntape.  So I called him (he was out) and told him and he came home and  <br/>\ndid that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was teaching, I would figure out how to get American Heritage  <br/>\npaperback dictionaries in bulk as inexpensively as I could (one year  <br/>\na dollar a copy through Scholastic books) and the dad of a friend of  <br/>\nmine owned a hardware store and would give me sample books of  <br/>\nwallpaper.  Each large page would cover two books.  So I&#39;d put the  <br/>\npaper down and kids would choose one and put their names inside. I&#39;d  <br/>\nglue the covers on and then the books lasted longer, the kids could  <br/>\nfind their own easily in the pile (we left them in lockers sorted by  <br/>\nclasses in the classroom), and I wish I had photos, because these  <br/>\nwere all the best of flocked and textured and metallic-sheen vinyl  <br/>\nwall coverings of the early 1970&#39;s.   I probably do have a few,  <br/>\nfalling apart, somewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Marty&#39;s glasses worked great, and Holly has a red cap to run her  <br/>\npony tail out the back of, but she&#39;s not liking the effect.  I might  <br/>\ntake her to Savers to get a costume wig she can make a ponytail out  <br/>\nof.  I have two real human hair braids, but one is Kirby&#39;s from when  <br/>\nhe was twelve or so, and the other is her dead biker uncle&#39;s and she  <br/>\ndeclines to wear that.

Or get this, Toys &#39;R&#39; Us sells <br/>\nan &quot;electronic soldier kit,&quot; complete with helmet with working flashlight, <br/>\ninteractive belt, vest, binoculars, goggles, shovel, dog tags, walkie talkie, <br/>\ncompass, medal and a whistle, but NO gun.<br/>\n <br/>\nI mean, I get the idea.  Everybody&#39;s afraid that some nine-year old kid is <br/>\ngoing to walk into 7-11 with one of these things and freak out the clerk who <br/>\nthinks it&#39;s real and shoots the kid whose parents then sue the toy company, or <br/>\nwhatever variation of that.  But I just figured there&#39;d be *some* <br/>\nsocially-apathetic manufacturer somewhere in China importing the things to some cheap store <br/>\nand that they wouldn&#39;t be so hard to find.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThey&#39;re available on ebay, so they must be selling them somewhere.  I know <br/>\nI&#39;ve seen them before.  But we didn&#39;t start soon enough because I thought it&#39;d <br/>\nbe easy to get.  (Perhaps I was thinking of *real* guns.)<br/>\n <br/>\nI just feel so SAFE now, though.  LOL  <br/>\n <br/>\nSam was very appreciative of our efforts, and was fine settling for a pirate <br/>\nknife and a camouflage hat and glove set I picked up at Dollar Tree, which <br/>\nhe&#39;ll wear with a red hoodie sweat suit with a tv test pattern taped to his <br/>\ntummy.  We&#39;re going to attach the red &quot;Po&quot; circle made out of pipecleaners to the <br/>\ntop of the hat.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWe plan to keep him out of 7-11 on Halloween though, just to be on the safe <br/>\nside. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nPatty<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s new at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31196,"nextTopicId":31230}}
