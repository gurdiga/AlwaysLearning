It is a little or big burst<br/>\n&gt; of understanding about how things work in our world and having either a<br/>\n&gt; flashing moment or a slow dawning of understanding about how the universe<br/>\n&gt; works in patterns that repeat and make sense at many many different levels.<br/>\n&gt; This is the level at which it feels spiritual to me. It is that level of<br/>\n&gt; &quot;connectedness&quot; and patterns and things working in a way that makes some kind<br/>\n&gt; of ultimate sense and that it is something we can strive to understand while<br/>\n&gt; knowing we can never fully understand. This is somehow related (and I&#39;m sorry<br/>\n&gt; that I can&#39;t express this more articulately) to my own belief that our<br/>\n&gt; purpose in this life is to strive to know God - who is unknowable (and who is<br/>\n&gt; not limited to the simple anthropomorphic concept of a deity that most<br/>\n&gt; religions teach). So - striving to comprehend something that uncovers or<br/>\n&gt; opens my eyes to patterns in the universe seems part of that spiritual<br/>\n&gt; purpose.  But - so is EVERYTHING else that involves learning; all things that<br/>\n&gt; give us glimpses into human nature or into the nature of the universe. I<br/>\n&gt; believe that we&#39;re hardwired with in inherent inner need to learn things to<br/>\n&gt; get those peak moment flashes or slow dawnings of understanding and that is<br/>\n&gt; why unschooling &quot;works.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and I have posted it on my refrigerator for further contemplation.<br/>\n Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":194,"nextTopicId":209}}
