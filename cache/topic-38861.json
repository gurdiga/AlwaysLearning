I am intrigued by unschooling and by the free<br/>\nschool model but see the reliance in the free school model on peers<br/>\nand social capital.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIn some ways those schools create a culture separate from the child&#39;s  <br/>\nhomelife and work within that.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling uses the real life that already exists, and the real  <br/>\nfamily.  Families have friends and neighbors and cousins, when  <br/>\nthey&#39;re lucky, and a young child&#39;s circle will continue to expand as  <br/>\nhe gets older, but it can happen naturally and gradually.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince they were little I liked the way having a visitor would change  <br/>\nthe dynamics and the use of the same old toys and swing set and art  <br/>\nsupplies.  A food the kids were used to having around would be  <br/>\nrecharged by the excitement of a visitor.  &quot;You have popsicles!?&quot; and  <br/>\nthe popsicles were more exciting, for a few moments.   A game that  <br/>\nhad gotten old was new again.  A treehouse got a new role in a new game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that the sort of inspiration you mean?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday Holly&#39;s friend Jasmine came over.  Jasmine is a year older,  <br/>\nand that&#39;s the family Holly stayed in England with and went to a  <br/>\nwedding in France with.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/england\">http://sandradodd.com/england</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSo Jasmine is in the dorms at the university in town, and hadn&#39;t hung  <br/>\nout with Holly alone for a while.  They both drive.  They could have  <br/>\ngone anywhere and done just about anything.  Jasmine had talked about  <br/>\nmaybe going to see Tropic Thunder, but Holly had already seen it  <br/>\ntwice.  They thought maybe of playing cards.  They ended up doing  <br/>\nShrinky Dinks for three hours, and Jasmine left with a little string  <br/>\nof shrinky dinks fastened to her purse, and a big smile on her face.   <br/>\nShe said she was glad they had done Shrinky Dinks instead of a movie,  <br/>\nbecause then they were able to talk.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":359427655,"authorName":"jisaac_rop","from":"&quot;jisaac_rop&quot; &lt;gjisaacschool@...&gt;","profile":"jisaac_rop","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"question about peer learning/social capital","postDate":"1222656398","msgId":38861,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdicGZpZSs2NGxzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":38863,"prevInTime":38860,"nextInTime":38862,"topicId":38861,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello all!

I&#39;m new here (also new to homeschooling - was <br/>\nhomeschooled myself but just brought my own kids home and am veering <br/>\ntoward unschooling).  I intend to simply read for a while to learn!  <br/>\nBut I do have a question tonight in my reading online and bouncing <br/>\nfrom place to place....<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been reading Sudbury School/Free School stuff and also ran <br/>\nacross info on the Hole in the Wall project (where a PC was placed in <br/>\na hole in a wall in a village in India and the village children <br/>\ntaught themselves within days to use it for a variety of purposes - <br/>\nthe experiment highlighted the ways that children glean knowledge <br/>\nthrough peer interaction without needing adult intervention or <br/>\nguidance)....<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here&#39;s my question.  I am intrigued by unschooling and by the free <br/>\nschool model but see the reliance in the free school model on peers <br/>\nand social capital.  I am wondering what folks here think of the <br/>\nvalue of peer &quot;inspiration&quot; (I&#39;m not talking grade level peers - I&#39;m <br/>\ntalking groups of children inspiring learning in one another as they <br/>\nshare knowledge - kind of children &quot;strewing the way&quot; for each <br/>\nother)....and whether this is lacking in your unschooling <br/>\nexperience.  Believe me, I am NOT asking the old socialization <br/>\nquestion - think it&#39;s one of the dumbest possible questions out <br/>\nthere.  But I do see the magic that happens when kids inspire each <br/>\nother.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have four kids, so I am amazed already at seeing their <br/>\nrelationships flourish and see how this kind of dynamic will happen <br/>\nwithin our own family but wonder what level of credence people here <br/>\ngive to the ideas and how they see it happen for their own children...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n- Jennifer (Denver, Colorado)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38821,"nextTopicId":38880}}
