It <br/>\nis a wonderful Anasazi site with excellent ruins. Anyway, the family who <br/>\nset up the visitor center did so before National Parks so it is quite <br/>\ninteresting.  One thing they used to have is a bunch of hummingbird <br/>\nfeeders, and I used to help the woman (can&#39;t think of her name right <br/>\nnow) fill them.  They used to also feed the squirrels and such.  They <br/>\ndon&#39;t do that anymore, cause they don&#39;t want to mess with the wild life, <br/>\nbut it was much fun to have these 10-15 feeders in this little <br/>\ncourtyard, the hummingbirds were quite used to the people and would flit <br/>\nright in front of you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents feed the hummingbirds down the road (by about 30 miles, or <br/>\nless as the hummingbird flies) at their house.  One day before they had <br/>\nbuilt their house and were only going up there on weekends, my parents <br/>\narrived to find a few hummingbirds waiting.  The feeder was empty.  The <br/>\nbirds were MAD.  One of them flew right into my mother&#39;s face and <br/>\nhovered there for a bit and then flew to the empty feeder and then to my <br/>\nmother&#39;s face.  She was not even allowed to empty the car first, she <br/>\nknew that she had to fill that feeder immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\njoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\nBADOLBILZ wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Last week my girls got to get up close and personal with a hummingbird,<br/>\n&gt; which is very rare, but has happened twice to me.

They got to get right up to it and see all it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; colors.  This happened to me a few years ago on the steps going up our<br/>\n&gt; back porch.  Each time, when I went to nudge the bird, it just flew<br/>\n&gt; away.  I&#39;m pretty sure they were young and paralyzed with fear until my<br/>\n&gt; hand coming at them startled them into motion.  But they really are<br/>\n&gt; amazing creatures!

We <br/>\n&gt; are sitting just off our kitchen, next to our screen porch.  (Couldn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; go out in the porch this a.m., too cool)   Anyway,,, I take a sip of <br/>\n&gt; coffee and lookup,  here, a hummingbird has flown right into the <br/>\n&gt; screen.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Ya see, last summer we hadn&#39;t finished the screen and they would fly <br/>\n&gt; right through.  We kept saying, &quot;oohh,  that porch is going to be a <br/>\n&gt; rude awakening for the hummingbirds!&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;He was stuck for maybe 20 seconds and visions of Flit (I think that <br/>\n&gt; was his name of the hummingbird in the movie Pocahontas) stuck in the <br/>\n&gt; canoe, came to mind.     It was pretty funny,  he&#39;s fine, went and <br/>\n&gt; drank from the feeder.   <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I know my tune would probably be different if he would have gotten <br/>\n&gt; hurt,  but he was so darn cute flying there,  then backing out. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I love watching those little birds!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Kelli~<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Your use of Yahoo!
