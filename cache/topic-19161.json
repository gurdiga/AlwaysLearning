I&#39;ve been homeschooling 8 <br/>\nyears.  In Alabama you must join a church cover school in order to <br/>\nhomeschool.  The first two cover schools I joined required progress reports <br/>\n- one of them monthly, the other twice yearly.  I also had in-laws and <br/>\nother relatives to whom it was important that I keep them informed (they <br/>\nfelt it was important and I felt it was important, since we were close and <br/>\nthey had always been interested in school activities and such while the <br/>\nchildren were in public school).  So I kept records - a daily log sheet and <br/>\na spreadsheet of all books read, videos watched, etc.  It was fairly easy <br/>\nto do when they were younger.  As the children have gotten older, I&#39;ve <br/>\nfound it more difficult to keep up ... or maybe I just don&#39;t feel it&#39;s as <br/>\nimportant to keep tabs, so my efforts towards this are not what they were <br/>\nin the past.   &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I recently had to finish &quot;creating&quot; a high school transcript for my <br/>\neldest to get her diploma from our church cover school.  At that time I was <br/>\nglad that I had kept even a minimum of records.  My daily log sheets when <br/>\nby the wayside a few years ago, but I still try to maintain the book/video <br/>\nrecords and I write things down (activities, big events) on my calendar and <br/>\nkeep those from year to year.  And occasionally I remember to write <br/>\nsomething down on a spreadsheet that replaced the daily log books.  Those <br/>\nfew notes and memos were invaluable in trying to come up with all the <br/>\ncredits for her diploma.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could have created my own diploma - it would have been just as legal as <br/>\nthe church cover school&#39;s diploma - but my daughter wanted one from the <br/>\ncover school.  She had enrolled in several college classes through <br/>\ndual-enrollment and had to use her church cover school&#39;s name (& permission <br/>\nform) in order to do so, and she thought it would look strange to have <br/>\ntaken dual-enrollment classes through one cover school and then have a <br/>\ndiploma with a different school name on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren M.

I have been lurking for awhile. I am homeschooling 2 boys. Right now they are just 4 and 1 so I can&#39;t say I have a lot of experience, mostly just theories I guess. And, you know how good that is! At any rate, my husband and I decided to homeschool our boys when the first one was 1 or 2, so when all our friends started sending their kids to school when the kids were 3!!, I started looking into homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for record keeping, I like the scrapbook idea. I do something similar. I keep what I call portfolios. You know how an artist keeps a portfolio of different pieces to show to potential clients. We do the same thing. We keep work that the boys have done to show their progress. It can include photos or notes I have written about their progress as well as art or written work the boys have done. We don&#39;t have to keep it for the state, we just keep it for ourselves so we can see the progress that we are making. The boys like looking at their old stuff and I have proof to Dad and other relatives that we are doing something!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the idea to keep receipts for museums and plays. I will start keeping them as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nGwen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] record keeping","postDate":"1080578981","msgId":19171,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkMi4xZDM0Zjc1Mi4yZDk5YWRhNUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":19169,"nextInTopic":19182,"prevInTime":19170,"nextInTime":19172,"topicId":19161,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/29/04 7:32:37 AM, kbcdlovejo@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1553152398\">In a message dated 3/29/04 7:32:37 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Don&#39;t let the state run your life.
