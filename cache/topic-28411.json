What I mean  <br/>\nis, watching hours and hours and hours of tv or playing hours and  <br/>\nhours and hours of videogames could possibly be a sign of depression,  <br/>\nbut it usually is not. Those are activities that can conveniently be  <br/>\nused to sort of occupy one&#39;s mind and avoid thinking about things we  <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to think about - a way to avoid feeling sad or scared or  <br/>\nangry. I think many of us have used these activities in this way, a  <br/>\nbit, here and there, so we kind of know that it is possible. Reading  <br/>\nand eating are other things people can use this way, sometimes, too.  <br/>\n(And, yes, many of us WERE told, as kids, to &quot;Put down that book and  <br/>\ngo out and play.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I think parents are concerned that tv and videogaming can be  <br/>\na form of avoidance of life or lead to avoiding other parts of life,  <br/>\nand I don&#39;t think that concern is completely unfounded. If I had a  <br/>\nkid who started watching tv for seven or eight hours per day, I would  <br/>\npay some attention to what else was going on with that kid and I&#39;d  <br/>\npay attention to how the child was interacting with the tv shows.  <br/>\nRosie, my 16 yo, just finished watching all eight seasons of &quot;The  <br/>\nWest Wing.&quot; There was no avoidance of life happening there - it was  <br/>\nthat she was LOVING the show and part of what was so enjoyable for  <br/>\nher was how much she was learning. She watched many episodes over and  <br/>\nover and she asked questions and googled things, because there was a  <br/>\nlot she didn&#39;t understand, at first. It has been really obvious that  <br/>\nwe had absolutely no reason to worry about her tv watching. This has  <br/>\nbeen a pattern for her - to get really into a certain show or two and  <br/>\nwatch and watch and watch it. For a long time it was Roseanne and The  <br/>\nCosby Show - she analyzed and analyzed the behaviors in those two  <br/>\nfamilies and our family has had many conversations about those family  <br/>\ndynamics. It has been an ongoing study of marriage and parenthood -  <br/>\ncollege courses in the sociology of families couldn&#39;t come close to  <br/>\noffering the amount of learning that we&#39;ve experienced through  <br/>\nRoseanne and The Cosby Show. English courses in writing &quot;Compare and  <br/>\nContrast&quot; essays couldn&#39;t have offered the kind of development of  <br/>\ncritical thinking that comparing and contrasting Roseanne and The  <br/>\nCosby Show offered.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids who are healthy and happy, who have lots going on in their  <br/>\nlives, who enjoy their lives, who have good, strong relationships  <br/>\nwith their parents, are not at risk, imo, for excessively watching tv  <br/>\nor playing videogames as a form of avoidance. The difference is  <br/>\nwhether they are choosing to do something (watch shows/play games)  <br/>\nversus using tv and gaming to avoid something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nParents can tell the difference IF they can shake themselves loose of  <br/>\nthe fear created by writers such as Marie Winn, auther of &quot;The Plug- <br/>\nIn Drug.&quot; Here is the publishers description of that book:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;In The Plug-In Drug, Marie Winn demonstrates &quot;with devastating  <br/>\npersuasiveness&quot; (The Washington Post) that television has a negative  <br/>\nimpact on child development, school achievement, and family life. But  <br/>\nrather than focusing on program improvement as a solution, Winn  <br/>\nproposes that the problem lies within the seductive act of TV  <br/>\nwatching itself. Extensive TV watching alters children&#39;s relations  <br/>\nwith the real world, depriving them of far more valuable real life  <br/>\nexperiences, especially playing and reading. Ever sympathetic to  <br/>\nparents&#39; need for relief, Winn proposes ways to control this  <br/>\naddictive medium and live with it successfully. This 25th anniversary  <br/>\nedition addresses the variety of new electronic media that have  <br/>\nsupplemented television in the home and increased children&#39;s bondage  <br/>\nto screen experiences. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is sensationalist fear-mongering. It isn&#39;t a thoughtful look at  <br/>\nwhat can help parents look at their real whole child. It assumes from  <br/>\nthe start that these things that children love (watching tv and  <br/>\nplaying videogames) are negative. It never considers the benefits of  <br/>\nsupporting a child&#39;s interest, engaging with the child in the  <br/>\nactivities the child loves best. It also doesn&#39;t consider the longer- <br/>\nterm impact on children who are reminded regularly that what THEY  <br/>\nlike to do is bad for them - how can these children not get the  <br/>\nmessage, loud and clear, that pursuing their own interests is a bad  <br/>\nthing to do?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy college classes are filled to capacity with young people who are  <br/>\nextremely out of touch with their own interests, passions, aptitudes,  <br/>\netc. Ask them what do they want to do - they frequently say, &quot;Get a  <br/>\ngood job.&quot; That&#39;s as far as they can think. They don&#39;t have any  <br/>\ninterest they want to pursue - they don&#39;t trust themselves to have  <br/>\nsuch interests. If they DO have an interest, they don&#39;t even consider  <br/>\nit as a possible career. Last semeseter, I had a student who was  <br/>\nmajoring in &quot;Business Management&quot; (many of my students are majoring  <br/>\nin business of some kind or another, because I teach economics). I  <br/>\ncomplimented her on a purse/bag that she was carrying and she told me  <br/>\nshe&#39;d made it herself. I said I loved it and would love to have a  <br/>\nsimilar one, wondered how much she&#39;d charge to make me one. Turns out  <br/>\nshe WAS making them for friends and sometimes selling one here and  <br/>\nthere. She designed them herself. She&#39;d also designed some clothing.  <br/>\nLoved it. I asked her why she didn&#39;t pursue fashion design and she  <br/>\nhad no answer, just hadn&#39;t really considered it. I got some  <br/>\ninformation for her about the Fashion Institute of Design and  <br/>\nMerchandising in Los Angeles and a few months later she emailed me  <br/>\nand she&#39;s been accepted to start there in the fall.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow is this related to tv and videogames? I honestly think that it is  <br/>\nALL about parents not being really engaged and in touch with their  <br/>\nown kids and not trusting themselves to really know their kids better  <br/>\nthan some author or journalist or even scientist who studies groups  <br/>\nof kids. Conventional wisdom is extremely distrustful of children and  <br/>\none aspect of that is being sure that adults know better than kids  <br/>\nwhat they ought to do with their time. But you can&#39;t grow up with  <br/>\nsomeone else always in charge of what you do with yourself and  <br/>\nconstantly reminding you that you can&#39;t trust your OWN interests, and  <br/>\nthen, suddenly, at 18, know yourself and be able to think about what  <br/>\nyou want to do with your time. I&#39;ve seen kid after kid after kid who  <br/>\nautomatically dismisses the idea of pursuing anything they are  <br/>\nactually interested in - they have deep inner belief that it must not  <br/>\nbe worth pursuing if they are interested in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to encourage parents of younger children to think with a  <br/>\nlonger-term perspective --- think (for yourself) about what long-term  <br/>\nmessage you&#39;re giving your child now. If you say, &quot;You&#39;d like to play  <br/>\nvideogames for 6 hours a day, but that&#39;s not good for you so I&#39;m  <br/>\nrestricting you to 2 hours per day,&quot; then what might the kid be  <br/>\nhearing from that? How about this? &quot;What I really LOVE to do and want  <br/>\nto do a lot is bad for me and it would be better if I didn&#39;t do it at  <br/>\nall, but I&#39;m weak and can&#39;t resist so i&#39;ll do just a little and feel  <br/>\na little ashamed when I do it.&quot; Yikes! Is that what we want running  <br/>\nthrough our kids&#39; minds all the time?
