It&#39;s by Deb Lewis.  It&#39;s not a  <br/>\nbang-on match for this topic, but there is an aspect that might be  <br/>\nhelpful.<br/>\n<br/>\n=====================================<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   ***Because im still not convinced.***<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat made you consider unschooling?   Why did you decide against school?<br/>\nIt&#39;s not our job to convince you of anything.  We offer ideas to people<br/>\nwho are interested in how unschooling works. But if you think there  <br/>\nis something of value in this philosophy then it&#39;s up to you to do  <br/>\nthe research *you* require to be convinced either way. To either say,  <br/>\nyes there&#39;s something here or no, it&#39;s not for me.  We can answer  <br/>\nquestions along the way.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Because some just watch TV. End. Then just play video games.<br/>\nPeriod.  No tangents.  No inspired learning.  No pursuits, no follow up.<br/>\nNo questions. No discussions.  ***<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve asked you before and I think others have too, tell us what your kid<br/>\nlikes.<br/>\n<br/>\nReally, it helps some people to focus on the positive.  Because I really<br/>\nget from your posts that you&#39;re very negative.  Maybe you&#39;re not in real<br/>\nlife, but the way these posts come through you&#39;re showing us a lot of<br/>\nnegativity about your kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t mean to be harsh.  I think it&#39;s an important part of why you&#39;re<br/>\nstruggling with some of these unschooling concepts.  I can&#39;t remember<br/>\nthe<br/>\nlast nice thing you wrote about your child.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not always easy to stay positive when we&#39;re worried (especially<br/>\nabout our kids)  but we can&#39;t help you with the worry if you&#39;re stuck in<br/>\na moment you can&#39;t get out of.  (Plagiarism!&lt;g&gt;) (Thank you Bono)<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease tell us what your kid likes to do, what does he consider to be<br/>\nthemost fun, what does he like to eat, what does he think about?   It  <br/>\nwill<br/>\nhelp, I promise.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will bet you quantities of cash that there are untold connections in<br/>\nyour child&#39;s mind when he&#39;s watching his favorite shows and playing his<br/>\nfavorite games.   Just because an interest doesn&#39;t take off and take<br/>\ntangible form doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not real.  Just because you&#39;re not<br/>\nseeing a physical manifestation of his intellectual life doesn&#39;t mean  <br/>\nthere&#39;s<br/>\nnothing going on.<br/>\n<br/>\n***And all the cool stuff your kids did only makes me feel that much<br/>\nmore frustrated.***<br/>\n<br/>\nYour son is nine?  I think we start comparing our kids to other kids<br/>\nabout this age, some before, but really about this age because they seem<br/>\nso big in so many ways.  We&#39;re saying goodbye to our babies and we&#39;re<br/>\nlooking for our grown kids and missing this incredible person in<br/>\nbetween.  And it can be, for the child, a difficult time when the  <br/>\nmost beloved<br/>\ntoys and games of childhood are losing their appeal and the very cool<br/>\nstuff of the world of adults still seems too hard and too far away.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat kinds of things do you do with him?  What do you talk about?  What<br/>\nare some of *your* interests and how do they manifest themselves in your<br/>\nfamily life?  What example do you set for your child?  Do you love life<br/>\nor are you bored?  Do you love to learn or are you dispassionate?  When<br/>\nyou see a bug do you wonder what it is or do you squish it?   These are<br/>\nall things to consider when we&#39;re wondering whether we&#39;re providing the<br/>\nmost interesting life possible for our kids.   It starts with us.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212831948,"authorName":"halfshadow1","from":"&quot;halfshadow1&quot; &lt;halfshadow1@...&gt;","profile":"halfshadow1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Can i be a good unschooling mom if....","postDate":"1192669017","msgId":31087,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZmNmIwcCtrbXY0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZmNXA4Yis5Nm9yQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":31086,"nextInTopic":31104,"prevInTime":31086,"nextInTime":31088,"topicId":31059,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My son and I go to sleep around 2am and we wake between 11am and noon.Sometimes i m not tired until 4am.

Some days i can&#39;t get out until 2pm.

This will free up more time and  <br/>\nenergy for your son.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe bought memberships to the local zoo and are looking into museums.  <br/>\nThat way, if I feel like I can get out but maybe only for an hour  <br/>\n(not all day) we can still go someplace, and if we leave early I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t feel like the admission was wasted. We cut out ads from local  <br/>\nstores and activities that look interesting, and taped them to a  <br/>\nwall. Then if we have a free hour (or if I have an hour&#39;s worth of  <br/>\nenergy) we can just pick one and visit.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is also the type to be disappointed if I hype something and  <br/>\nthen we can&#39;t go. I just stop hyping the events. When I get up, if I  <br/>\nfeel like we can go someplace, I will ask him what he wants to do  <br/>\n(giving him a few options of things I feel up to).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere may be a lot of things you can do at home, with some  <br/>\nforethought as far as you own limitations. Can you help him cook? Do  <br/>\nart projects? Put him in a bathtub with measuring cups and funnels  <br/>\nand thermometers and ice? Pam Sorooshian had a recipe for a gelatin  <br/>\nthingie that you can put paint in with an eyedropper - those are a  <br/>\nLOT of fun! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sandradodd.com/strew/tadaa.html\">http://www.sandradodd.com/strew/tadaa.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a teenager in the neighborhood who can take him to the park  <br/>\nafter school? Another homeschool family that can drive him to  <br/>\nparkdays or classes? Would a motorized scooter help? They have those  <br/>\nat a lot of places now, in the grocery stores and zoos and things.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might also ask HIM for ideas, what he&#39;d like to do at home.
