The last time he had a checkup, the doctor told him he was &quot;a little heavy.&quot;  The doc was not mean or lecturing, just said stuff like &quot;be sure to eat healthy and get some exercise.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis ended up having a bad effect on my son&#39;s self-image.  He started to call himself fat, and think of himself as fat.  I don&#39;t consider him fat.  He is a little chubby, he has a bit of a tummy on him, but I don&#39;t consider him fat.<br/>\n  <br/>\nAlthough he tends more toward sedentary activities, he also likes to play basketball; he has been taking karate twice a week for a couple of years now, so I would describe him as moderately active.  His weight does not interfere with him doing physical activity.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn preparation for what we might hear at the doctor&#39;s office next week, I put Cas&#39; stats into a height/weight chart.  He is 5&#39;2 and 135 pounds, and that is considered obese!  Obese?  I was shocked.  I think it&#39;s bullcrap.  He&#39;s not obese. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know that if he hears the word &quot;obese&quot; in the doctor&#39;s office, it is going to do a number on an already shaky body image.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have dealt with negative body image all my life, I remember feeling fat when I was young, probably from age 8 on up.  When I look back at pictures of myself when I was a child, I was not fat in the least.   I sometimes wonder how things might have been different if I had not thought of myself as fat.  If I had had a positive body image instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I know firsthand that how you perceive yourself and how you feel about yourself matters greatly.  I would like for my son to not feel bad about his weight.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am considering slipping the doctor a note beforehand explaining that Cas is already sensitive about his weight, that he eats pretty healthy and does get exercise, and to ask the doctor not to hammer on the weight too hard. Or at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t take him for the check up at all (the reason he hasn&#39;t been is because for a few years is because I wanted to avoid further weight discussions with the doc,) but Cas wants to go for a specific purpose.  (His ears have been bothering him since we flew on an airplane last spring and we are planning another plane trip and he&#39;s worried about how that will affect his ears.) <br/>\n<br/>\nI was wondering if anyone has dealt with this issue and, if so, how they handled it.  Does anyone have other suggestions besides giving the doctor a note beforehand?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,  Jennie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63850,"nextTopicId":63871}}
