Since the phenomenon of �word blindness� was<br/>\nfirst documented more than a century ago, scientists have searched for the<br/>\ncauses of dyslexia, and for therapies to treat it. In recent years,<br/>\nhowever, dyslexia research has taken a surprising turn: identifying the<br/>\nways in which people with dyslexia have skills that are superior to those<br/>\nof typical readers. The latest findings on dyslexia are leading to a new<br/>\nway of looking at the condition: not just as an impediment, but as an<br/>\nadvantage, especially in certain artistic and scientific fields.<br/>\n  Enlarge This Image<br/>\n   Tucker Nichols<br/>\n<br/>\n   Dyslexia is a complex disorder, and there is much that is still not<br/>\nunderstood about it. But a series of ingenious experiments have shown that<br/>\nmany people with dyslexia possess distinctive perceptual abilities. For<br/>\nexample, scientists have produced a growing body of evidence that people<br/>\nwith the condition have sharper peripheral vision than others. Gadi<br/>\nGeiger&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cbcl.mit.edu/people/geiger/geiger-new.html\">http://cbcl.mit.edu/people/geiger/geiger-new.html</a>&gt;and Jerome<br/>\nLettvin, cognitive scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of<br/>\nTechnology, used a mechanical shutter, called a tachistoscope, to briefly<br/>\nflash a row of letters extending from the center of a subject�s field of<br/>\nvision out to its perimeter. Typical readers identified the letters in the<br/>\nmiddle of the row with greater accuracy. Those with dyslexia triumphed,<br/>\nhowever, when asked to identify letters located in the row�s outer reaches.<br/>\n<br/>\nMr. Geiger and Mr. Lettvin�s findings, which have been confirmed in several<br/>\nsubsequent studies, provide a striking demonstration of the fact that the<br/>\nbrain separately processes information that streams from the central and<br/>\nthe peripheral areas of the visual field. Moreover, these capacities appear<br/>\nto trade off: if you�re adept at focusing on details located in the center<br/>\nof the visual field, which is key to reading, you�re likely to be less<br/>\nproficient at recognizing features and patterns in the broad regions of the<br/>\nperiphery.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe opposite is also the case. People with dyslexia, who have a bias in<br/>\nfavor of the visual periphery, can rapidly take in a scene as a whole �<br/>\nwhat researchers call absorbing the �visual gist.�<br/>\n<br/>\nIntriguing evidence that those with dyslexia process information from the<br/>\nvisual periphery more quickly also comes from the study of �impossible<br/>\nfigures,� like those sketched by the artist M. C. Escher. A focus on just<br/>\none element of his complicated drawings can lead the viewer to believe that<br/>\nthe picture represents a plausible physical arrangement.<br/>\n<br/>\nA more capacious view that takes in the entire scene at once, however,<br/>\nreveals that Escher�s staircases really lead nowhere, that the water in his<br/>\nfountains is flowing up rather than down � that they are, in a word,<br/>\nimpossible. Dr. Catya von<br/>\nK�rolyi&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.uwec.edu/Psyc/faculty/vonkarolyi.htm\">http://www.uwec.edu/Psyc/faculty/vonkarolyi.htm</a>&gt;,<br/>\nan associate professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin, Eau<br/>\nClaire, found that people with dyslexia identified simplified Escher-like<br/>\npictures as impossible or possible in an average of 2.26 seconds; typical<br/>\nviewers tend to take a third longer. �The compelling implication of this<br/>\nfinding,� wrote Dr. Von K�rolyi and her co-authors in the journal Brain and<br/>\nLanguage, �is that dyslexia should not be characterized only by deficit,<br/>\nbut also by talent.�<br/>\n<br/>\nThe discovery of such talents inevitably raises questions about whether<br/>\nthese faculties translate into real-life skills. Although people with<br/>\ndyslexia are found in every profession, including law, medicine and<br/>\nscience, observers have long noted that they populate fields like art and<br/>\ndesign in unusually high numbers. Five years ago, the Yale Center for<br/>\nDyslexia and Creativity &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dyslexia.yale.edu/\">http://dyslexia.yale.edu/</a>&gt; was founded to<br/>\ninvestigate and illuminate the strengths of those with dyslexia, while the<br/>\nseven-year-old Laboratory for Visual<br/>\nLearning&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/dyslexia/LVL/\">http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/dyslexia/LVL/</a>&gt;,<br/>\nlocated within the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, is<br/>\nexploring the advantages conferred by dyslexia in visually intensive<br/>\nbranches of science. The director of the laboratory, the astrophysicist Matthew<br/>\nSchneps &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/dyslexia/LVL/People/Matt.html\">http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/dyslexia/LVL/People/Matt.html</a>&gt;, notes<br/>\nthat scientists in his line of work must make sense of enormous quantities<br/>\nof visual data and accurately detect patterns that signal the presence of<br/>\nentities like black holes.<br/>\n<br/>\nA pair of experiments conducted by Mr. Schneps and his colleagues,<br/>\npublished in the Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society in 2011,<br/>\nsuggests that dyslexia may enhance the ability to carry out such tasks. In<br/>\nthe first study, Mr. Schneps reported that when shown radio signatures �<br/>\ngraphs of radio-wave emissions from outer space � astrophysicists with<br/>\ndyslexia at times outperformed their nondyslexic colleagues in identifying<br/>\nthe distinctive characteristics of black holes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the second study, Mr. Schneps deliberately blurred a set of photographs,<br/>\nreducing high-frequency detail in a manner that made them resemble<br/>\nastronomical images. He then presented these pictures to groups of dyslexic<br/>\nand nondyslexic undergraduates. The students with dyslexia were able to<br/>\nlearn and make use of the information in the images, while the typical<br/>\nreaders failed to catch on.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven that dyslexia is universally referred to as a �learning disability,�<br/>\nthe latter experiment is especially remarkable: in some situations, it<br/>\nturns out, those with dyslexia are actually the superior learners.<br/>\n<br/>\nMr. Schneps�s study is not the only one of its kind. In 2006, James Howard<br/>\nJr. &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://psychology.cua.edu/faculty/howard.cfm\">http://psychology.cua.edu/faculty/howard.cfm</a>&gt;, a professor of<br/>\npsychology at the Catholic University of America, described in the journal<br/>\nNeuropsychologia an experiment in which participants were asked to pick out<br/>\nthe letter T from a sea of L�s floating on a computer screen. Those with<br/>\ndyslexia learned to identify the letter more quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever special abilities dyslexia may bestow, difficulty with reading<br/>\nstill imposes a handicap. Glib talk about appreciating dyslexia as a �gift�<br/>\nis unhelpful at best and patronizing at worst. But identifying the<br/>\ndistinctive aptitudes of those with dyslexia will permit us to understand<br/>\nthis condition more completely, and perhaps orient their education in a<br/>\ndirection that not only remediates weaknesses, but builds on strengths.<br/>\n Annie Murphy Paul is the<br/>\nauthor&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://authors.simonandschuster.com/Annie-Murphy-Paul/18895973\">http://authors.simonandschuster.com/Annie-Murphy-Paul/18895973</a>&gt;of<br/>\n�Origins.� She is at work on a book about the science of learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, Jan 30, 2012 at 11:59 PM, megates &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:goodlifehomeschool@...\">goodlifehomeschool@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was going to say almost everything that Chris said in message 65348.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My Jackie didn&#39;t read (fluently, independently) until about age 13, but<br/>\n&gt; she grew up in a houseful of reading, readers, audio books, magazines,<br/>\n&gt; library visits, attending live theater, watching TV/movies together, and<br/>\n&gt; lots of other things that were not reading-dependent, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think she was/is/has/had dyslexia, but will never know, because I never<br/>\n&gt; tried to get a professional opinion.
