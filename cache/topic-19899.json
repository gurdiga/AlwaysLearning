She is apart of the parkday I co-lead and it is a sense of <br/>\nfrustration, knowing that she has many exclusivity issues that are <br/>\nnot only effecting our friendship but that of the group I co-lead. <br/>\nSo I must strive to view this relationship from both a friendship <br/>\nand leader perspective. I do not wish to exclude her, however, her <br/>\nnegativity and exclusionary behaviors are hurting people. So therein <br/>\nlies my struggle. The challenges of my being a leader in the <br/>\nhomelearning community! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other relationship is one that I share with my husband. We have <br/>\nbeen separated for 2 months now, and one of the meany issues <br/>\nseparating us in heart and in spirit is that of life learning <br/>\n(unschooling). This is a relationship though he may not know it, I <br/>\ncherish completely. But I feel very torn because he does not view <br/>\nthe children&#39;s lives as one of choice. He does not see the value of <br/>\nlife learning for what it truly is, despite my attempts to show him <br/>\nthe path. (Yes, Sandra he does have your site!:) I feel quite lonely <br/>\nand sad at times not being able to share all the wonder and awe in <br/>\nlife, in being free for our children and us all to choose, in <br/>\nunschooling with him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel very happy and blessed for you, that you have a husband that <br/>\nembraces your views and supports you. I too long for this and am <br/>\nsearching for a way to have this with him.
