To find out for herself what this school world<br/>\n&gt; it like and meet some more kids her age. So far, it&#39;s been ok. She<br/>\n&gt; finds the work boring and pointless but she likes lunch and taking the<br/>\n&gt; bus home. She&#39;s noticed her handwriting quickness and neatness aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; up to par (but we&#39;ve discussed that it&#39;ll improve as she does it more)<br/>\n&gt; but her typing skills are way ahead :-) . So far the monotony of it<br/>\n&gt; all is worth the social stuff to her.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; She took a timed math facts test on Friday (addition, subtraction,<br/>\n&gt; multiplication and division) and was pretty discouraged. The kids<br/>\n&gt; sitting next to her flew through it and she turned in a blank division<br/>\n&gt; paper. She&#39;d never done bracket division. She practiced this weekend<br/>\n&gt; and I emailed her teacher and told her Lydia was worried that the<br/>\n&gt; teacher would think she was being difficult by turning in a blank<br/>\n&gt; paper. The teacher emailed me back and said that Lydia shouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; worry, that she thinks Lydia is a sweetie and she&#39;ll have no trouble<br/>\n&gt; catching up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cool.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Since then Lydia has felt the she&#39;s pretty average in the class and<br/>\n&gt; feels she&#39;s catching on easily. She mostly gets discouraged with the<br/>\n&gt; homework and the point of actually having to do some of the boring<br/>\n&gt; stuff they do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Then today the dean of students calls me and ask me if I have any<br/>\n&gt; testing from Lydia&#39;s homeschooling days. I say no, I had been her<br/>\n&gt; supervising teacher and the state doesn&#39;t require testing then(the<br/>\n&gt; requirement in IA is either working with a licensed teacher or<br/>\n&gt; testing). She then says she would like to test Lydia because her<br/>\n&gt; teachers have some concerns. Apparently she wasn&#39;t &quot;even able&quot; to<br/>\n&gt; find the US on a world map. I have no idea how they asked her this<br/>\n&gt; question cause I know she knows where the US is. We have a globe we<br/>\n&gt; refer to in our living room quite often and also a US map in the hall<br/>\n&gt; near her room with stars on it of all the places we travel to and a<br/>\n&gt; world map in the basement where the kids hang. I do know that they&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; sent homework home with totally distorted (photocopied) maps w/out<br/>\n&gt; borders (like borders of states and countries) on them and the kids<br/>\n&gt; are supposed to figure out what goes where. We got a map of a<br/>\n&gt; themepark we were at a couple weeks ago and she was able to find the<br/>\n&gt; rides she wanted to ride just fine... ;-) :-D !<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Then the dean tells me they would like to do a baseline test on Lydia.<br/>\n&gt; Honestly, I&#39;ve got pretty negative views of testing and think they<br/>\n&gt; are a horrible way to assess children. So, I said no, I prefer you<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t test her. I prefer you judge her by the work she does in school.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, my question to you. (sorry this is getting so long) Do I ask<br/>\n&gt; Lydia if she wants to do this test? AND do I even tell Lydia that the<br/>\n&gt; dean called me with these concerns? If I do, she&#39;ll be bummed and<br/>\n&gt; think less of herself. I don&#39;t want that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tuesday before school Lydia was saying she wants to quit. I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know how long this school experience will go on. I wouldn&#39;t be<br/>\n&gt; surprised either way (staying or leaving), she is enjoying being<br/>\n&gt; around all those kids. Lydia is a hardworking, organized, highly<br/>\n&gt; motivated girl. I have NO worries that she&#39;ll be able to do whatever<br/>\n&gt; she sets her mind to. Those personality traits will be much more<br/>\n&gt; beneficial to her than writing neat or being able to multiply and<br/>\n&gt; divide quickly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sorry, I know this really isn&#39;t an unschooling question but I<br/>\n&gt; would really like your opinions on this. Part of me is probably just<br/>\n&gt; feeling defensive of our lifestyle choices and I don&#39;t want that to<br/>\n&gt; interfere with my handling of these situations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I should also say that I wrote one of her teachers (the one the dean<br/>\n&gt; mentioned) and he emailed me back. He didn&#39;t mention any concerns he<br/>\n&gt; had to me (which is what I asked) just said she is delightful and he<br/>\n&gt; is trying to get to know her better.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is part of what I wrote to him:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;Lydia has not had a traditional approach to learning.
