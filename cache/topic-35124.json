Learning is not &quot;work&quot; in the context of a<br/>\ngame: it is puzzle-solving, exploration, and experimentation. Cooperation is<br/>\nnot a &quot;necessary evil&quot; in the context of a game: it is the best part of the<br/>\nexperience. And few communities are as prolific and generous as those that<br/>\nform around games. The videogame paradigm offers powerful lessons for<br/>\nbusiness, and innovative businesses are using videogames in powerful new<br/>\nways. In *Changing the Game*, top Microsoft Xbox executive David Edery and<br/>\nMIT videogame researcher Ethan Mollick explains how businesses can leverage<br/>\ngames&#39; interactivity to build far deeper relationships with a new generation<br/>\nof customers and employees. The authors begin by reviewing the increasingly<br/>\neffective use of videogaming in training. Next, they survey the growing use<br/>\nof games in state-of-the-art advertising and marketing programs. They then<br/>\nintroduce more transformative potential opportunities for gaming: approaches<br/>\nthat are only beginning to emerge from research laboratories. These include:<br/>\nthe use of games to spur innovation, and to harness the wisdom of crowds.<br/>\nEdery and Mollick conclude with concrete recommendations on how to work with<br/>\nvideo game companies, and some powerful insights on the future of business<br/>\nand games in general, drawn from their unique vantage point as MIT<br/>\nresearchers, an Xbox executive, and gamers.<br/>\n<br/>\n*About the Author*<br/>\n*David Edery* is Worldwide Games Portfolio Planner for Xbox Live Arcade, and<br/>\nresearch affiliate of the MIT Comparative Media Studies Program (CMS).

Not that anyone<br/>\nhere needs confirmation that games are fine, but this might be a good thing<br/>\nto hand to relatives. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~L!<br/>\n<br/>\n~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~<br/>\nWriting here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theexcellentadventure.com/\">http://www.theexcellentadventure.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nEvolving here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.consciouswoman.org/\">http://www.consciouswoman.org/</a><br/>\n~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35019,"nextTopicId":35114}}
