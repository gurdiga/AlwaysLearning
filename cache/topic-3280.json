We considered relocating to New Mexico.  But now<br/>\nwe have a place we love here in CA on the outskirts of the Bay Area.<br/>\nI live with a lot of trees around and on really clear days I can see<br/>\na peak of the ocean!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt snowed here today!  It snowed overnight and was mostly melted by<br/>\nmorning.  Then at 1 this afternoon it started  and in a matter of<br/>\nminutes the deck was covered.  It was a hail/snow combo - little <br/>\nballs of ice.  So my children quickly got dressed and went outside.<br/>\nThey had a blast and came in when they got too cold!  I want to go<br/>\nto the snow later this year but it&#39;s really neat for them to watch<br/>\nit come down.  The dog had been napping and woke up when it was<br/>\ncoming down.  She had to go outside and bark at it a bit.  She was<br/>\nvery happy to come back inside.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nCindy Ferguson<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:crma@...\">crma@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":9440128,"authorName":"ElissaJC@concentric.net","from":"&lt;ElissaJC@...&gt;","profile":"elissajc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Elissa singing","postDate":"1012264445","msgId":3281,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAzMmMwMWMxYTg1YyRhOTZjNzcwMCQzOTM4YWRjZUBFbGlzc2FKQz4="},"prevInTopic":3280,"nextInTopic":3290,"prevInTime":3280,"nextInTime":3282,"topicId":3280,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
