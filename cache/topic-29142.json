I have recently rejoined this list after a long absence (and I was<br/>\njust a lurker before, so I doubt anyone would remember me--although Sandra,<br/>\nyours was the voice that first got me started thinking about homeschooling<br/>\nand unschooling way back on AOL in the mid 90s, when my oldest was just an<br/>\ninfant...I used to go to chats you hosted there). I have five children ages<br/>\n12 to 1, always homeschooled, and though we started off as unschoolers I<br/>\ndrifted into requiring this and that over the years--very gentle & Charlotte<br/>\nMasonish, but still some requiring.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we have mostly been happy but often been tense, and in the past few<br/>\nmonths I&#39;ve been looking around and noticing that there really is a lot more<br/>\ntension here in my home than I had realized. I realized I am being more<br/>\ncritical, a scolder, and this is so far from the picture I have always had<br/>\nof myself that it has been something of a shock.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I resubbed here and have spent a couple of days buried in the archives<br/>\nand reimmersing myself in all the helpful stuff at Sandra and Joyce&#39;s sites.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s rather a humbling experience to take a good look at yourself and see<br/>\nthat you&#39;ve lost hold of something you once held very firmly in your heart.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I&#39;m a huge believer in fresh starts, and I decided to just hit my<br/>\npersonal reset button and start fresh. I am still pondering some of the<br/>\nbasic issues about chores, meals, etc, that I know many of you have settled<br/>\nfor yourselves a long time ago. For now I have begun with something very<br/>\nsimple, which is saying yes instead of no. I was reading Sandra&#39;s Yes page<br/>\nand I could hear myself saying no no no all the time. I used to always be a<br/>\nyes mom. Somewhere between kids 3 and 4 I drifted into no...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m seeing myself use words like &quot;drift&quot; and &quot;shift&quot; a lot, and it&#39;s strange<br/>\nthat it feels so gradual and invisible a change in me, because that implies<br/>\nthe opposite of mindfulness, and honestly it&#39;s not like I ever stopped<br/>\nthinking about parenting and education issues. Perhaps I&#39;ve thought about<br/>\nthem TOO much, read too many opposing points of view, got all muddled up in<br/>\nmy own mind. What do I really think? I hardly know anymore. (I told you it<br/>\nwas humbling. I&#39;m pushing 40 and I feel way dumber than I did at 25.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThings are not terrible here, just, as I said, sometimes full of friction.<br/>\nCross words coming out of my mouth (the 25 yr old me would be shocked).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, as I said, yesterday I took a deep breath and started over, with<br/>\nYES. I kept a little list of all the things the kids asked for (they didn&#39;t<br/>\nsee me doing this).<br/>\n<br/>\nCan we have some jellybeans? Yes.<br/>\nCan we watch a movie? Yes<br/>\nCould you get me a pickle and a napkin in a bowl, and can I eat it on the<br/>\ncouch? Yes. (Shushing the mom-voice in my head that wanted to say we NEVER<br/>\neat on the couch, you know that. I just said &#39;sure&#39; and got the pickle, and<br/>\nthen another when she asked for a second one.)<br/>\nCan we play a computer game? Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater I was looking at my list and I thought, wow, I&#39;d have loved to have a<br/>\nday like that when I was a kid. Jellybeans and a movie and pickles and<br/>\ncomputer games.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t actually have any of the &quot;but what if all they ever want to do is<br/>\neat jellybeans and play computer games&quot; concerns because I see how creative<br/>\nmy kids are and how whenever they&#39;ve had time on the computer or watching a<br/>\nvideo they run off and play elaborate pretend games based on whatever they<br/>\nwere watching/playing, and they ask me to read to them a lot, and THEY read<br/>\na lot, and I am constantly astonished by how much they know and how most of<br/>\nit is a surprise to me, not stuff I&#39;ve directed. So, since I am NOT worried<br/>\nabout that, I had to ask myself what I AM worried about--why would I have<br/>\nsaid no to those same requests the day before?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am thinking about all this, why I became a No mom, and getting back in the<br/>\nhabit of saying yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I wanted to thank you for your illuminating discussions here.<br/>\n<br/>\nSara, mom of five<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29106,"nextTopicId":29201}}
