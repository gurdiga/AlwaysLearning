I think for her, it had to<br/>\n&gt; do with collecting words.  She&#39;d see a word, ask me what it said, I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; tell her and she rarely forgot it after that.  Once she knew enough<br/>\n&gt; words, she was able to read fluently.  So all those words, she knew by<br/>\n&gt; how they looked first, not how they sounded.  It&#39;s a different way of<br/>\n&gt; learning how to read than the system used in schools of sounding out of<br/>\n&gt; words, which made absolutely no sense to her before she knew how to<br/>\n&gt; read.<br/>\n<br/>\n::waving madly:: That&#39;s us too!  Although I&#39;m not sure Rowan&#39;s a late<br/>\nreader (he&#39;s six), he is all about the shape and the color and the<br/>\nsize and the font of the word. My mother, who is a librarian, picked<br/>\nhim out a copy of &quot;Max&#39;s Words&quot;,<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Maxs-Words-Kate-Banks/dp/0374399492)\">http://www.amazon.com/Maxs-Words-Kate-Banks/dp/0374399492)</a> and<br/>\nlaunched his &quot;word collection&quot;. He has a latching green plastic box,<br/>\nand a pair of scissors, and all forms of printed recyclable material<br/>\nthat enter my home get examined for interesting words, which are then<br/>\ncut out and put in the box.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s funny; he adores words, but isn&#39;t so interested in putting them<br/>\ntogether. I&#39;ve suggested that it&#39;s a lot like legos, where you take<br/>\nthe pieces and connect them in your own way to form your own thing,<br/>\nunless it&#39;s like following the lego directions, where you build<br/>\nsomething according to someone else&#39;s rules (like haiku). He likes the<br/>\nidea but isn&#39;t ready to leap there yet. However if you take it down a<br/>\nlevel, he&#39;s fascinated by how the letters go together. He adores<br/>\nspelling. He spells words in conversation rather than saying them.<br/>\nHe&#39;s constantly asking how things are spelled, and from the outside,<br/>\nit looks soooooooo schoolish. I would *never* have drilled him in<br/>\nspelling the way he&#39;s asking to be drilled. But as long as he&#39;s asking<br/>\nand it&#39;s making him happy, we&#39;re rolling with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~L!<br/>\n<br/>\n~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~<br/>\nWriting here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theexcellentadventure.com/\">http://www.theexcellentadventure.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nEvolving here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.consciouswoman.org/\">http://www.consciouswoman.org/</a><br/>\n~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41799,"nextTopicId":41875}}
