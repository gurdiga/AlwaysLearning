That works great for bringing into various rooms in the house and watching or listening to things.  The only time we watch things on a small screen laptop is when we are snuggled into bed and don&#39;t need to move around and do things.  We have 3 TV&#39;s in our house that rarely get used for watching straight up TV.  Sometimes we watch something on the rolling cart and play a video games using the TV.

That is what unschoolers look out for, the new opportunities to explore &quot;strange new worlds&quot; (sorry, couldn&#39;t help myself there!)  If a kid is doing the same thing for years and years, never looking left or right, I&#39;d feel like we were missing something.  I&#39;m sure there are kids who do this, I&#39;ve met autistic children like that, but they are more the exception than the rule.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps it would help you to see TV as the &quot;something new&quot;, that she&#39;s immersed herself in!

Add to it the same way you&#39;d add to a child who&#39;s developed a sudden interest in taking pictures or collecting rocks.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, this is very much the crux of seeing natural learning.

Why wouldn&#39;t you <br/>\n&gt; rather she&#39;d hear all kinds of voices?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Eric and I have recently decided not to read The Amber Spyglass aloud together. We listened to the first two books in the series as audiobooks on trips (the His Dark Materials series by Phillip Pullman) and the audio books were so very good, with different excellent actors doing the voices, that we have decided we want to listen to the audiobook of Amber Spyglass as well. There are other books where accents figure prominently that I either wish we&#39;d listened to the audiobooks (The Dark is Rising books, when they go to Wales and expect me to read a Welsh sentence!) or am glad we did (the Artemis Fowl books). I&#39;m good at reading aloud but sometimes an audiobook is more satisfying in some ways. So we do both.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Yehva, who is 2, likes to do everything herself. She doesn&#39;t want to listen to me read a book; she wants to hold the book, and be the one to &quot;read&quot; it, which usually means pointing out things in the picture, or pretending to read some of the letters. This is a really fun thing to do with a book, sure, but it means that right now, TV shows are how Yehva is having the experience of having a story told to her, with a coherent narrative. If I said &quot;No TV,&quot; she&#39;d either be not having that experience right now, or I&#39;d be pushing her to let me read the books the way they are &quot;supposed&quot; to be read.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy experience is that the various media complement each other. It&#39;s not TV versus audiobooks versus readaloud. It&#39;s &quot;TV for this, audiobooks for that, readaloud for this other thing.&quot; Pam is right, the day is long and there&#39;s room for a lot of stuff in it. I used to have a friend who was appalled at how much TV Eric watched (she didn&#39;t say &quot;appalled&quot; to me, she said, &quot;Don&#39;t you worry about how much TV Eric watches?&quot;) and I would point out to her that on a day when Eric watched TV for, let&#39;s say four hours, he might also have been outside running around for two hours, and at the park with me for an hour, and reading books with me for an hour, and working on Legos for two hours. Kids who are unschooled don&#39;t have the time limits that schooled kids do, that pit TV vs. free play vs. Legos so directly against each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be honest, too, Yehva is a very active kid who doesn&#39;t need much sleep. I&#39;ve been mysteriously unwell for about two years now (improving, finally, but not remotely 100% yet...maybe 70%, with better and worse days). Watching TV shows is a way for her to be occupied with something enjoyable while I take a break, or a way for her to have some quiet time that she otherwise won&#39;t take. We are exactly that family you hear reviled in stories about how terrible TV is, who &quot;use&quot; TV as a &quot;babysitter.&quot; During the 18 months when I couldn&#39;t get through a whole day awake, Yehva often spent time in her crib in the afternoon while I napped, watching TV--by 18 months she had her own TV and an iPod loaded with videos we could hook up to it. I would feel really bad about this except that she enjoys TV and I think that&#39;s fine. I have been glad to have thought this through before Yehva came along, so that on top of everything else I was dealing with I wasn&#39;t thinking I was a bad mother because my toddler was watching the Backyardigans and Blue&#39;s Clues for 90 minutes or two hours while I slept.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu, mom to Eric, 8; Carl, 6; Yehva, 2.5<br/>\ntapeflags.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Bringing TV in, and other things","postDate":"1273589904","msgId":54062,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRCRTk3MDkwLjcwMDA3MDdAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDRCRTk1MDZELjUwNDA3QHlhaG9vLmNhPg==","referencesHeader":"PDRCRTk1MDZELjUwNDA3QHlhaG9vLmNhPg=="},"prevInTopic":54061,"nextInTopic":54063,"prevInTime":54061,"nextInTime":54063,"topicId":52641,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

She loved sitting on the laundry machines and putting the coins in the slots, and carrying the coins downstairs.  She loved baking with me.  She loved playing with her toys.  Reading books.  She regularly requested lots of these things, and whatever else she thought up.  She liked eating lunch together, me preparing it while she thought of what she wanted to include. Our days felt fuller. <br/>\n<br/>\nThese days, she doesn&#39;t want me to come near her when she&#39;s watching a show.  She spends hours, several times a day.  If she isn&#39;t watching shows, and I go check my email quickly, or go to cook or clean something small, she&#39;ll ask to watch a show.  She won&#39;t come away from her shows to do the things she really loved before... even at the intervals between shows.  She gets really irritated at the baby because he comes and tries to get her to play, pulls on her chair. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m confused, really.  Its like the times when we do things that are special are still there, but the times when we would be just playing on the floor, or something nice but easy to pass a bit of time, those have disappeared.  <br/>\n<br/>\nToday, for example. We woke up.  Her first chosen activity was to watch Kai-lan.  She eats breakfast in front of the computer.  I take down the diapers to wash - she doesn&#39;t want to come put the coins in.  I put the baby for a nap (TV makes that easier).  She asks to have/make cookies.  I invite her to bake with me.  She says she wants me to make them while she watches... but she is &#39;sooo hungry&#39; and can&#39;t wait.  I offer her some other food and explain that cookies take time to cook. I made lunch. I invited her to eat with me in the kitchen, but she normally refuses these days.  Today I came out and sat with her to eat and watch.  She didn&#39;t push me away, perhaps because of the food involved?  After we ate, she did come and help me bake.  The baby woke during that, and I put him on my back.  A bit later, after the first batch was baked, and she&#39;s gone back to watching TV, I look out the window to see city people repainting the road.  I get excited, she pauses the show and comes to watch.  Then we all decide to go outside... and we end up watching the road crew for and hour or so.  We check on our plants too.  When we come back in, guess what?  She wants to watch TV some more (this is Kai Lan, all day long, a few episodes in rotation).  I invite her to help me pick out fabrics for her &#39;birthday dress&#39; (a much talked about tradition here).  She tells me to pick without her!!!  (Ok, I was a bit hurt, but thats my problem).  So, I brought fabrics out to her, and she did help me pick, pausing the TV for a bit.  My memory is going a bit foggy here... but I think she then watched TV while I made some dinner, until daddy got home.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I read all that (its long, sorry), I see a really full and exciting day.  And yet, when there are hours of just sitting in front of the TV, it doesn&#39;t feel that way.  Those hours used to be filled with playing with toys and puzzles and stuff.  And I see that some of this might be that many of the toys and games she wants to play these days are not possible with the baby around (because he wrecks whats on the floor, or wants my attention away from her games if we move to a table top).  When he naps (1 hour a day) is the only time for those things.  I can&#39;t remember the last time we&#39;ve read books together.  That used to happen daily.  I feel like I do initiate a lot of activity.  Sometimes she really likes something new (using my old stamp collection), but there are still all those hours of the day where she is just sitting and watching.  I can&#39;t sit with her for that long.  The baby needs me too, and there is some housework I have to do to keep things running (not running smoothly, just running at all).  I&#39;ve moved a lot of those tasks to the evenings, but often fall asleep when the kids do because they stay up late several nights a week.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... it feels like TV is responsible.  It feels like TV is bigger and more powerful than me, than life, than toys and playing and books.  It feels like its just a magnet, it has a stronger pull.  I have to bring something super exciting into the mix, like road work, or a new craft, in order to &#39;beat&#39; TV.  And I know I don&#39;t want to think in an adversarial way about it, but its really feeling this way.  I can&#39;t make every moment super duper exciting!  With a 4 and 1 year old, its just really hard to do that. I need to cook some little amount.  I need to clean just a tad.  There are lots of things to do here, and I mix it up and we try new things, and we get out most days of the week (sometimes too much).  I&#39;m very involved.  I actually ENJOY our play, its not just me giving her my time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess there is always more to write, so this is enough.

This definitely sounds true... but we&#39;re somewhat afraid to take that step when we still are on the fence about whether we want to have a television at all (me and husband that is).  Temima has never asked for TV or a TV Set yet.  We don&#39;t want to move forward, and then decide its not for us, and then decide to take it away.  So Joseph and I have decided to take things slowly (since she isn&#39;t asking for a TV set anyhow) for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nand, &quot; If she has the option to turn the TV off and come and be with<br/>\nyou, it&#39;s not a babysitter. It&#39;s one of many things she can choose<br/>\nfrom. It&#39;s something from which she can learn, and something that can<br/>\namuse her. She can learn songs, get ideas for projects and play.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLast week, we went to the mall to return something.  I thought it was going to rain, so we walked instead of me biking with the children in our trailer.  Temima wanted to start out walking and ride in the stroller when she would get tired.  She didn&#39;t get tire!  Its a long walk.  Wow.  So, along the way she started picking dandelions, and then dropping them like Hansel and Gretel so we could find our way home.  That was lovely.  Then we somehow started talking/acting out a Dora episode (about getting chocolate from chocolate trees), and spent much of the walk harvesting chocolate. It was lots of fun.  I do see the potential in her experiences with TV.  It is lovely in those moments. <br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote: She is watching for much longer periods, the same shows over and over.<br/>\n<br/>\nBernadette wrote: Reading stories over and over until you can recite them in your sleep years later is one of those clichés of parenting that people laugh fondly about, yet for some reason if a child wants the same kind of repetition with a TV show that often seems to be presented as a bad thing. To me it seems like exactly the same thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts similar.  But when we&#39;re reading books over and over, we are reading the books.  The voice is mine, the turning the pages is both of us, the &#39;can you find the truck?&#39; and &#39;how many balloons can we see?&#39; part is there.  Television can be about our relationship, but it does involve a certain level of &#39;not direct interaction&#39;. So, I don&#39;t quite feel comfortable equating them.  But I definitely see the similarity in why children would want to have books, or shows, repeated a lot.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nOffer shows to watch together. Don&#39;t rest on your laurels, don&#39;t wait for an invitation, be more engaged and engaging with her. The shorter temper is probably unrelated to watching shows and is more about the lack of direct care. That sounds harsh, but my guess is that because she isn&#39;t demanding attention things like feeding her and making sure she isn&#39;t thirsty are going more by the wayside than they would if she was hanging out with you more. Bring her platters and drinks, make up smoothies or chocolate milk or a lassi and sit it next to<br/>\nher and touch her head and ask if you can watch the show with her. Ask to share what she is enjoying instead of coming over to check e-mail or look something up on-line. Make an effort to connect with her more and more.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s kind of nice when a child is so engaged with something you can do other things, your own things. It is easy to get in the habit of doing things that aren&#39;t about the child, aren&#39;t about your relationship with the child, taking care of their needs, making sure that food and drink and love and affection are part of their day. And the less you work to connect the more it becomes a habit.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the beginning, it was exciting.  There was so much she wanted to watch, and we watched certain youtube videos over an over again.  Together.  We explored many different topics.  We learned how to braid bread.  I invited the watching.  It was an activity, just like coloring or going to the park.  It was great. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler, you are never harsh (for as long as I&#39;ve been reading, at least).  I&#39;ll admit that in the past 2 weeks, there may have been less direct care... because of some of the turmoil I&#39;m feeling.  When I originally wrote, I was very engaging and pro-active.  I wasn&#39;t just stopping in to check email or look something up.  I did that (mostly to book wheel-trans for my mother, and then confirm with her nursing home), but I also sat and watched with her often.  It was during that time that she started not wanting me to sit with her.  It began to look to me as if she was watching in order to occupy herself, rather than for pleasure or learning or fun.  I brought her food, played around with the &#39;monkey platters&#39; a bit, drinks, etc.  I played with the baby on the floor in the same room.  And I did the same household tasks that I had usually done (very minimal amounts of housework just to keep things going), and that she had usually hung around with me for.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have some more thoughts, but I&#39;m going to write a seperate post because this is really long.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nShira</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Bringing TV in, and other things","postDate":"1271523780","msgId":52879,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PHcybDNhOTNmZmYxMTAwNDE3MTAwM25mNjU0MGQ4OXZlZDE4OTBmYjg4ZTkyNDNjQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEVBNjM0N0IzLTM4MUEtNDgyMS04RThBLTYwQzI2QTlEQzMxNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGhxMGhyaituMGpyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgkgPEVBNjM0N0IzLTM4MUEtNDgyMS04RThBLTYwQzI2QTlEQzMxNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":52691,"nextInTopic":54039,"prevInTime":52878,"nextInTime":52880,"topicId":52641,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Karl goes through cycles.

Don&#39;t rest on your laurels, don&#39;t wait for an invitation, be more engaged and engaging with her. The shorter temper is probably unrelated to watching shows and is more about the lack of direct care. That sounds harsh, but my guess is that because she isn&#39;t demanding attention things like feeding her and making sure she isn&#39;t thirsty are going more by the wayside than they would if she was hanging out with you more. Bring her platters and drinks, make up smoothies or chocolate milk or a lassi and sit it next to her and touch her head and ask if you can watch the show with her. Ask to share what she is enjoying instead of coming over to check e-mail or look something up on-line. Make an effort to connect with her more and more. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s kind of nice when a child is so engaged with something you can do other things, your own things. It is easy to get in the habit of doing things that aren&#39;t about the child, aren&#39;t about your relationship with the child, taking care of their needs, making sure that food and drink and love and affection are part of their day. And the less you work to connect the more it becomes a habit. Last night I was in doing the dishes and out the window I could see David and Simon and Linnaea playing a game of freeze tag (stuck in the mud) and I watched for a couple of minutes and then put down the dishes and went outside and played. Making an effort to move outside your own progression through the day to engage with your daughter will make a huge difference, huge difference, to her mood, to her response to you. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the past month, though, she has become very possessive of the computer/TV. Any delay on our part is received with a strong emotional reaction. Before, if I needed to do something quick on the computer, she would be happy to pause the show for me.  And I didn&#39;t abuse that kindness.  But now she gets upset.  She is watching for much longer periods, the same shows over and over. She does come away sometimes and says she got bored.  She also doesn&#39;t want to watch the youtube clips she liked before, nor the library talking book program that she loved.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRecently she&#39;s been telling us not to watch with her, and not even to look at her or the screen from across the room while she is watching.  I also can&#39;t use the computer at all during the day, can&#39;t quickly check email or anything, without her insisting on watching a show. She used to come away from the TV for dinner, if we told her we would wait until she was done watching her show.  Now she doesn&#39;t want to, just wants to keep watching episode after episode.  I have brought her meals to the TV as well, but dinner is the only time that daddy gets to be with us all, so we&#39;d like to have her there. (Maybe we should all sit and watch while we eat together...)<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of this behavior, the increasing time of watching, the emotional outbursts around it, etc... have my husband (and me a little bit) concerned.  I think we imagined this would be like the lollipops, she would gorge a bit and then return to mostly the way she was before.  I frankly thought the candy would take much longer for her to get over, since she&#39;s known about candy but not had much.  TV didn&#39;t even exist for her really. <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom one perspective, I feel like just getting a television screen for her, so I can use the computer while she watches something (my husband is resistant to having a real TV though).  On the other hand, I feel like I&#39;m already leaning on the TV as a babysitter, cleaning and stuff while she watches (the baby plays by himself pretty well sometimes), and getting a real TV might just increase all of this.  I&#39;d rather be playing with her, like we used to.  I feel guilt at not finding lots of exciting things for us to explore together... and when I do offer something she often says no.  And it seems like the things she would want to do are things the baby tears apart, and she refused to let me move us to a higher surface to keep him away.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a tangent, in general she&#39;s gotten shorter tempered, more prone to tantrum, less patient with her brother, etc... since the TV shows came into her life.  Leaves me wondering a bit, since we&#39;ve been more attentive, said more &#39;yes,&#39; been generally the most flexible ever during this period, and played so much more.  Until the TV shows, life had begun to be so enjoyable with the three of us at home during the days, filled with lots of activities, outings, friends, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know whats going on.

The devise is a small box with a remote that wirelessly streams movies and shows.  It is part of Netflix.  It works by adding shows to a queue and then they can be accessed on a tv screen.  She would only have access to shows you preselect and unlike a DVD it only plays one episode before it shows the menu.  The remote only has 8 buttons and would be perfect for little fingers.  It also holds your last watching spot exactly if it gets turned off.  It might give her some choice and control, but not free-for-all on the TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my house, I find the more natural breaks between watching helps everyone move away from the TV for a while.  It is much easier to ask for their attention at the end of an episode.  Once they have started a disc of shows, they often want to watch them all.  Each time the menu comes back up, they choose again whether or not to continue watching.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmanda<br/>\nEli 9, Samuel 7<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Bringing TV in, and other things","postDate":"1271124423","msgId":52645,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVBNjM0N0IzLTM4MUEtNDgyMS04RThBLTYwQzI2QTlEQzMxNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhxMGhyaituMGpyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhxMGhyaituMGpyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":52641,"nextInTopic":52653,"prevInTime":52644,"nextInTime":52646,"topicId":52641,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-From one perspective, I feel like just getting a television screen for her, so I can use the computer while she watches something (my husband is resistant","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1635062590\">-=-From one perspective, I feel like just getting a television screen  <br/>\nfor her, so I can use the computer while she watches something (my  <br/>\nhusband is resistant to having a real TV though).

I think we started applying the principles of unschooling in our family back in December/January (but were basically doing much of it even before that). <br/>\n<br/>\nA positive: We decided to let go of fears around candy, sweets, etc... and have started buying snackfoods when our daughter asks, when we can afford.  She seems fairly accepting of our finances, although still with some unhappiness when we really can&#39;t afford all the things she wants.  We started out with a bag of lollipops, and that was the clincher for us (my husband and I) - when she started doling them out, eating as many or as little as she wanted, and by the end of the bag there was one lonely lolli left and she just didn&#39;t want it.  I finally ate it. So, while we still get fustrated when she won&#39;t eat ANYTHING, we aren&#39;t worried about sweets. That was liberating. <br/>\nI recently showed her some television. We watched together various clips on Youtube (Barney, acrobatics, Elmo, Yoga for kids, synchronized swimming, etc) and she loved that.  It was very interactive for us.  Then I realized there was streaming episodes of Dora and Diego and other such shows in the NickJr website and we watched a lot of that together.  I actually enjoyed a lot of the content on Diego and Dora shows.  I have been putting on shows at her request, not denying her for no good reason (sometimes I&#39;m changing a diaper or otherwise unable).  <br/>\n<br/>\nOver the past month, though, she has become very possessive of the computer/TV.
