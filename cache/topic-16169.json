If they choose to spend a little and save the <br/>\nrest, cool. If they choose to use every cent, cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nKree recently bought a new knife at the knife shop in our local mall. She had <br/>\n$20. She looked at several knives and decided to buy the smaller of the two <br/>\nshe liked the most. It was only $3 less than the bigger one. I asked why she <br/>\nchose the small one, when the large one was not much more and she had enough <br/>\nmoney for either one. She told me, that $3 was going to buy ice cream for her, <br/>\nher sister and their cousin, when we got home from the mall. So she completely <br/>\nchose how to spend every cent. She weighed what was important to her and she <br/>\nmade her decision based on her own wants and needs. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe knife shop owner was suprised at the process. She took her time and you <br/>\ncould see her wheels turning the entire time. He asked why I let her not only <br/>\nmake up her mind without my input, but why I &quot;allowed&quot; her to buy a knife. <br/>\nInstead of answering him, I questioned him back. &quot;Did you see her thought process <br/>\n(which I knew he had since I watched him watch her)? Do you think she takes <br/>\nownership of this knife without serious contemplation? Why should I not &quot;allow&quot; <br/>\nher to spend her money on what she wants?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe shop owner chuckled, and said, &quot;Well I think you are on to something <br/>\nhere, mom.&quot; So Kree walked away with her knife and a large grin, the shop owner <br/>\nmet a family where the kid had as much right to make decisions as an adult and I <br/>\nwalked away happy for them both.<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16120,"nextTopicId":16093}}
