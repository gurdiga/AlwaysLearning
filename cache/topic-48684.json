This is actually common &quot;wisdom&quot;<br/>\nfor budget planning and reducing your grocery bills (though I don&#39;t think<br/>\nthat&#39;s true). That would exhaust anyone, much less someone with mountains of<br/>\nlaundry, a baby and a kid with special needs. Something&#39;s gotta give; I saw<br/>\nthat as an area that could be deprioritized easily.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve done weekly menu planning for many years, and yes, it does have<br/>\nsomething to do with wanting to save money (we&#39;re on a tight budget, as are<br/>\nmost homeschooling families), but it has more to do with me making a good<br/>\nuse of my time and energy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started doing it when my children were infants/preschoolers because just<br/>\nabout the last thing I wanted to do was to put them in the car to go to the<br/>\ngrocery store. If I could whittle grocery trips down to once a week I was<br/>\nreal happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still go to the grocery store once a week - the girls are now 11 and 13.<br/>\nWhen the meals are planned and items bought, it&#39;s there and I don&#39;t have to<br/>\nthink about it again until that day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do a weekly dinner menu. For breakfasts and lunches we eat leftovers and I<br/>\nkeep staples on hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nDinner is important for our family - both kids and husband. When given a<br/>\nchoice they all choose having a meal at home that I&#39;ve fixed over going to a<br/>\nrestaurant, getting carry-out or having a frozen dinner. It&#39;s just something<br/>\nI do to make everyone happier and our life go smoother.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes, Cara<br/>\n<br/>\n,_._,___<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48633,"nextTopicId":48716}}
