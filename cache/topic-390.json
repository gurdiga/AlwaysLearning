If someone is playing with something that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t really lend itself for playing together or<br/>\nthey wanting to play alone they get to until they are<br/>\ndone.

Yet if they really<br/>\nwant it I suggest that they can ask the the other kid<br/>\nif the can play with it.

If kids say<br/>\nthat I am more often at a loss of what to do....<br/>\nSometimes I come into the fray after someone has taken<br/>\nsomething from someone and I don&#39;t want to take it<br/>\nback because that seems to me to me to be modeling<br/>\ngrabbing exactly what just happened already...Usually<br/>\nI support the kids who wants the toy back by saying<br/>\nyou can request the toy back. If the other says no I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know what do....It seems not okay for somone to<br/>\ntake the toy away and seems not okay for me to take it<br/>\nback....<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I could sure use some other ideas how to go<br/>\nabout this or another way to look at it so I could<br/>\nfind all those x,y,z ways to react calmly to help the<br/>\nkids. <br/>\n<br/>\nRemembering when ds-3yrs took a ball that was offered<br/>\nto him kind of at a Tube Town kind of place. Seconds<br/>\nafterwards the kid about 18 mo wanted it back. The dad<br/>\nredirected the 18mo old to another ball and the kid<br/>\nwas fine. Thats probably what I would have done if the<br/>\n18mo was mine. I wouldn&#39;t have has a problem with it.<br/>\nI wonder if the Dad wished I had done more...I said to<br/>\nmy ds something like I think the little on wants the<br/>\nball back but he didn&#39;t want to give it back. So if I<br/>\nam supposed to help him give it back which I am not<br/>\nsure I am...but if I am how do you do that<br/>\nrespectfully? <br/>\n<br/>\nI generally strive to see myself as the facilitator of<br/>\ngetting along rather than the judge and jury... I do<br/>\nneed to be present for interactions maybe more than<br/>\nother parents need to because my dd has a very intense<br/>\ntemperament. I also wonder when parents say we stay<br/>\nout of their kids squabbles. Because if I do that it<br/>\ncan get really intense and hurtful...Parents who stay<br/>\non the sidelines are you facilitating or are you<br/>\nreally staying out of it or do you think you have more<br/>\neven tempered kids?<br/>\n<br/>\nSamantha<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend your FREE holiday greetings online!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://greetings.yahoo.com\">http://greetings.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":498,"nextTopicId":509}}
