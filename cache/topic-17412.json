We even<br/>\n&gt; pronounce his name wrong. Seuss, in fact, rhymes with &quot;zoice&quot; -- it was<br/>\n&gt; Geisel&#39;s mother&#39;s maiden name. (His outsider status as a child of German<br/>\n&gt; immigrant stock contributed, no doubt, to his lifelong shyness and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>distrust of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the limelight. During the First World War, he was nicknamed &quot;the Kaiser&quot;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>by<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; his schoolmates.) Geisel adopted the name Seuss when he was a student at<br/>\n&gt; Dartmouth, where he studied English and contributed to the Jack-O-Lantern<br/>\n&gt; college newspaper. Caught drinking in his room with his friends, he was<br/>\n&gt; suspended by the dean from the magazine as punishment, but he continued to<br/>\n&gt; work under his assumed name. The &quot;Dr.&quot; honorific was adopted later, after<br/>\n </span></blockquote>his<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; departure from Oxford University, when he abandoned his academic career,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; his father&#39;s ambitions that he would become a Ph.D., to pursue his love of<br/>\n&gt; drawing and cartooning.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The very name Dr. Seuss is thus a product of Geisel&#39;s disobedience and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>refusal<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to conform, and this is important. Geisel was a genius, and the flavour of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>his<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; genius is iconoclastic, revolutionary.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In the fertile garden of American childhood of the postwar period, Geisel<br/>\n&gt; quietly sowed the seeds of critique in works that champion justice, the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>power<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; of the imagination and the rights of the little guy, banishing conformity<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; authoritarianism and even the conventions of language itself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; While the earlier books have their adherents, most true Seuss connoisseurs<br/>\n&gt; agree that the &quot;essential Seuss&quot; is 1957&#39;s The Cat in the Hat, which can<br/>\n </span></blockquote>be<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; read as a general call to arms for creative anarchy and freedom. The cat<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the trickster, an agent of change who wreaks havoc in stultifying fifties<br/>\n&gt; suburbia.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But Geisel&#39;s other works tackle a host of political issues with increasing<br/>\n&gt; explicitness. The Butter Battle Book, with its escalating, fear-driven<br/>\n </span></blockquote>contest<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; between the Yooks and the Zooks, is a cautionary tale about nuclear<br/>\n&gt; proliferation. Horton Hears a Who brings us a kindhearted elephant who<br/>\n </span></blockquote>saves<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the kingdom of microscopic Whos from extinction. (Are the Whos the Jews?)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yertle the Turtle is, by the author&#39;s admission, a take on Hitler&#39;s rise<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; power. (In early drafts, Yertle sports the Fuhrer&#39;s short-cropped<br/>\n </span></blockquote>mustache.)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And in The Sneetches, a capitalist named Sylvester McMonkey McBean profits<br/>\n&gt; from the trade in imprinting and erasing stars on the bellies of the<br/>\n&gt; trend-conscious bird-like beasts, manipulating their desire like the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>expert<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Madison Avenue ad man Geisel himself once was. (These stars are also, for<br/>\n </span></blockquote>many<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; readers, an echo of the Star of David borne by Jews in Hitler&#39;s Germany.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Geisel&#39;s own favourite of his books, however, was The Lorax, in which the<br/>\n&gt; rapacious Once-ler discovers the profits to be made from chopping down all<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; truffula trees, building factories and convincing the masses of the need<br/>\n </span></blockquote>for<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; thneeds (an ambiguous knitted garment), which he produces in his<br/>\n&gt; pollution-spewing textile factory.

At the end, just one seed is left from<br/>\n </span></blockquote>which<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; regeneration might begin anew, held aloft by the Lorax, a short and fuzzy<br/>\n&gt; prophet of environmental doom, and a repository of wisdom for the future.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Readings of the book have taken place in anti-logging rallies from the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Pacific<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Northwest to Australia, and several U.S. school boards have been<br/>\n </span></blockquote>petitioned,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; unsuccessfully, to censor the book, with Seuss detractors alleging that it<br/>\n&gt; misrepresents the forest-products industry.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Together these works are delicately coded moral parables on the perils of<br/>\n&gt; capitalism, xenophobia and intolerance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Geisel&#39;s biographer, Neil Morgan (who wrote the definitive Dr. Seuss and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Mr.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Geisel with his wife, Judith), insists on the central importance of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>political<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ideas in Geisel&#39;s work, but says that the artist thought of it rather just<br/>\n </span></blockquote>as<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ethics, as a case of teaching kids, and maybe their parents, what&#39;s right<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; wrong.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m subversive as hell,&quot; Geisel declared in an interview decades earlier,<br/>\n&gt; shortly after winning the Pulitzer Prize. &quot;The Cat in the Hat is a revolt<br/>\n&gt; against authority, but it&#39;s ameliorated by the fact that the cat cleans up<br/>\n&gt; everything in the end. It&#39;s revolutionary in that it goes as far as<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Kerensky<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and then stops. It doesn&#39;t quite go as far as Lenin.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The origins of The Cat in the Hat, too, are political -- in the broadest<br/>\n </span></blockquote>sense<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; of empowering the powerless. Geisel was of the opinion that &quot;too many<br/>\n </span></blockquote>writers<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; have only contempt and condescension for children, which is why we give<br/>\n </span></blockquote>them<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; degrading corn about bunnies.&quot; Clearly, they deserved better.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Responding to dropping literacy rates, his publisher Bennett Cerf<br/>\n </span></blockquote>challenged<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Geisel to write a book using just 220 easy-to-read words, a book that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>children<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; could read on their own, and an antidote to the dreary wholesomeness of so<br/>\n&gt; much early reading. (Green Eggs and Ham, which followed it, was written<br/>\n </span></blockquote>using<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; just 50 words.) It was, as Geisel put it, &quot;a way of kicking Dick and Jane<br/>\n </span></blockquote>out<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; of the school system.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The result was a sensation and The Cat and the Hat has since been the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>subject<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; of many an academic foray. Heinz Insu Fenkl, director of creative writing<br/>\n </span></blockquote>at<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the State University of New York at New Paltz, who has written on Seuss&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; relationship to alchemy and cabalistic thought, describes the way in which<br/>\n </span></blockquote>cat<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (id) and fish (superego) battle for domination of the children. He notes,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>as<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; well, that the absence of the mother makes the story frightening.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Fenkl points to the ending as particularly charged, with the reader asked:<br/>\n&gt; &quot;What would you do if your mother asked you?&quot; Would you disclose the truth<br/>\n&gt; about the day, or conceal it? &quot;Children who read this understand<br/>\n </span></blockquote>profoundly<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the nature of this transgression,&quot; he argues. &quot;They understand that the<br/>\n&gt; culture of children is actually quite different than that of adults, that<br/>\n&gt; there are things that you keep from adults.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Other interpretations are more political in focus. Art Spiegelman, in his<br/>\n&gt; essay accompanying Richard Minear&#39;s Dr. Seuss Goes to War: The World War<br/>\n </span></blockquote>II<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Editorial Cartoons of Theodor Seuss Geisel, posits the cat as a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>permutation of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Uncle Sam in his stovepipe hat. (In many of Geisel&#39;s earlier political<br/>\n&gt; cartoons, the U.S. is figured as a busted-down eagle in a high hat.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s worth noticing that The Cat in the Hat was written not long after the<br/>\n&gt; Americans ended their peacetime occupation of Germany and Japan. Can it be<br/>\n&gt; read, one wonders, as a parable of American interventionism, with Geisel<br/>\n&gt; implying, albeit subliminally, that the United States always cleans up its<br/>\n&gt; mess? (Okay, so he had a few all-American blind spots.) Still, it&#39;s not so<br/>\n&gt; far-fetched when you consider that he declared Horton Hears a Who to be<br/>\n&gt; inspired by the plight of the Japanese following the war.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The cat also serves as the distillation of a number of figures from<br/>\n </span></blockquote>children&#39;s<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; literature. He&#39;s a cousin of Lewis Carroll&#39;s Mad Hatter, another famous<br/>\n&gt; subversive, but his oversized bow tie suggests Mickey Mouse, as do the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>white<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; gloves. (Or do we detect a touch of Al Jolson here?) Fenkl notes, too, the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>way<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; we read Geisel&#39;s stories differently as we age, with the narratives taking<br/>\n </span></blockquote>on<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; new meanings from our more adult perspectives. &quot;Classic German fairy tales<br/>\n&gt; function in just this way,&quot; he says.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Cat in the Hat is not the only Dr. Seuss work to be subjected to close<br/>\n&gt; analysis. Philip Nel of Kansas State University is the author of the<br/>\n&gt; forthcoming scholarly book, Dr. Seuss: American Icon, cataloguing Geisel&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; accomplishments and analyzing his legacy. In the course of his research,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nel<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; has managed to scare up some exotic academic interpretations. Jonathan<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Cott,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; for example, has compared And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street to<br/>\n&gt; Goethe&#39;s The Erl-King, an interpretation that Geisel evidently endorsed.<br/>\n&gt; (Goethe&#39;s story was a favourite of his in childhood.) There is also Mary<br/>\n&gt; Galbraith&#39;s Agony in the Kindergarten: Indelible German Images in American<br/>\n&gt; Picture Books, which, Nel says, &quot;reads Mulberry Street and H. A. Rey&#39;s<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Curious<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; George in terms of intersections between the author-illustrators&#39; lives<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; German and American history and identity.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Alison Lurie&#39;s The Cabinet of Dr. Seuss examines the negative image of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>women<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; in Seuss&#39;s books.

Is it a<br/>\n&gt; desecration or a reconsecration of Seuss&#39;s masterpiece? It can&#39;t be as<br/>\n </span></blockquote>bad,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; say, as the pseudo-Seuss books put out by Seuss Enterprises after Geisel&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; death, like Oh the Things You Can Do That Are Good for You -- with its<br/>\n&gt; encouraging words about personal hygiene and the benefits of healthy food<br/>\n&gt; choices. Infamy!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The critical response to the film has been overwhelmingly negative. And it<br/>\n&gt; certainly fiddles a fair bit with Geisel&#39;s original plot: A love interest<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; inserted for mom, who works as a real-estate agent.
