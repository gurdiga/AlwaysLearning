I bought all of them.. they included mario party 5 and several harry potter games and a sonic... Anyway, I brought them home thinking I would dole them out one at a time, but my 6 year old saw them on top of my high dressor and asked what they were.  My kids were so excited.  <br/>\nI put a pile of books in my bathroom, and last night the same six year old was getting into bed after I read to him and asked me to get him one of those books.<br/>\nYesterday, we were in a Rugged Wearhouse looking for shorts and my 7 year old found a tshirt that said, &quot;Peter the Hutt&quot; with a picture of Peter from Family Guy and his wife as Jabba the Hutt and Princess Leah.  He thought it was the best thing in the world.  He wanted to buy it and at first I kind of backed off, what would people think after all...

The weekend was marvelous, and, after today&#39;s, I found myself doing something I never would&#39;ve considered, even a week or two ago....<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnalise has recently mastered mouse and touchpad navigation, and is becoming more motivated to read (Jeremiah reads a lot; so does Daddy.  Mommy simply cannot ignore words on paper....here, it&#39;s a cultural thing.)and play games, since the ones her brother has seem so cool to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of our games are secondhand, or were gifts we bought for Miah when he was smaller.
