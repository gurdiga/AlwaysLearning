Having higher <br/>\nexpectations and better teaching won&#39;t lead to fewer children being identified <br/>\nas having special needs.  I think it has little to do with &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; <br/>\nteaching at all and I truly believe &quot;higher expectations&quot; are often more harmful <br/>\nto children.<br/>\n<br/>\n â€œHigher expectations of all children, and better teaching and learning, would <br/>\nlead to fewer children being identified as having special educational needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder how many parents really believe that?  Probably lots!  I opted not to <br/>\nsend Chamille to school when she was 5 and ready for kindergarten because I <br/>\nrealized that she was a body with a dollar sign attached to it, nothing more. <br/>\n What was good for her, based on what I felt was good for her, as her parent, <br/>\nwas dismissed entirely because of low kindergarten enrollment and the need to <br/>\nhave her butt in a seat at that school.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was a huge turning point for me!  While an individual teacher might have <br/>\nseen some of the cool things about Chamille that I saw, teachers have very <br/>\nlittle power to change or do anything different, and they change each year.   <br/>\nThey also wanted to start off her kindergarten year without even knowing her, by <br/>\nputting her in therapy because they thought she was lacking in fine motor skills <br/>\nsince she didn&#39;t like to hold a damn pencil.  The larger system didn&#39;t care at <br/>\nall, it doesn&#39;t care at all.  It can&#39;t.  It cares about numbers and <br/>\naccountability of funds.  Period.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot one single person could persuade me different.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m so glad I recognized that!  It didn&#39;t take long to find unschooling.  About <br/>\n2 weeks into our homeschooling I stumbled across the old unschooling dot com <br/>\nboards and it fed my soul and change our lives so drastically and so beautifully <br/>\nthat I would never go back and change anything!  I&#39;m glad the school system <br/>\nshowed it&#39;s ugly underbelly and I&#39;m glad I saw it for what it was instead of <br/>\nbelieving what they told me!<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is so completely different from what schools do!  I&#39;m not diagnosing <br/>\nmy children to fit into anything.  They fit into the world because they exist <br/>\nand we mesh, like play dough, and squeeze and squish and change and fit into our <br/>\nsurrounding and we are impressed upon and change and grow and shift and add to <br/>\nour beings.  My kids don&#39;t need to be rigid square pegs trying to painfully fit <br/>\ninto round holes!  For that, I&#39;m so eternally grateful!<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"article about schools and diagnoses","postDate":"1284461355","msgId":57291,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxNTQ2My45OTk3OC5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwOC5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":57306,"prevInTime":57290,"nextInTime":57292,"topicId":57291,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Apparently schools in the UK are being accused of using labels of special needs to cover up poor teaching: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-778745327\">Apparently schools in the UK are being accused of using labels of special needs <br/>\nto cover up poor teaching: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8000168/Ofsted-schools-exaggerating-special-needs-to-hide-poor-teaching.html\">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8000168/Ofsted-schools-exaggerating-special-needs-to-hide-poor-teaching.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a system where testing scores is how a school demonstrates value and where <br/>\nyou can get more funding if you have more children who have a diagnosis of one <br/>\nlearning disability or another it seems inevitable that these will be the <br/>\noutcome.
