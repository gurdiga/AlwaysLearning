I am very<br/>\n&gt; skeptical by nature so the first thing I did was check out the<br/>\n&gt; company. I contacted the Better Business Bureau and found that the<br/>\n&gt; company has had no complaints lodged against them, I also contacted<br/>\n&gt; Paypal who has verified this company. They told me that they verified<br/>\n&gt; the company&#39;s licenses, bank accounts and other paperwork indicating<br/>\n&gt; to them that the company is legitimate. Then I started asking co-<br/>\n&gt; workers and friends about this program and to my surprise 6 out of<br/>\n&gt; the 10 people that I spoke with were already using this program. They<br/>\n&gt; told me how pleased they were with it and how much money they had<br/>\n&gt; saved and are currently saving. They told me that they have seen<br/>\n&gt; numerous television programs for this. So I decided to sign up for<br/>\n&gt; this program on 1/20/03. On 1/23/03 I received my complete membership<br/>\n&gt; package and the fun began. Using their program and the free lifetime<br/>\n&gt; membership that it includes I went to the supermarket ready to make a<br/>\n&gt; killing. The cashier rang up my grocery bill and it came out to<br/>\n&gt; $239.87 then I presented her with the coupons I received from this<br/>\n&gt; program and I saved $223.38 - my final bill was only $16.49! The<br/>\n&gt; cashier wasn&#39;t the only one shocked.
