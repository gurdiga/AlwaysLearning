Then after another one went through I<br/>\nchecked by snopes and wrote in with another &quot;reply all.&quot; That&#39;s when the<br/>\nforwards stopped. I don&#39;t even get other ones anymore since then, such as<br/>\npraising war in God&#39;s name.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are plenty of forwards which don&#39;t use a false claim that&#39;s easily<br/>\nfact checked.
