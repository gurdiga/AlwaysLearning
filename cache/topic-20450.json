This is the reason that I don&#39;t even love to use the word &quot;unschool&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n**Sounds like me. I gave up on using that term as an explanation years ago<br/>\nand simply say &quot;my children don&#39;t go to school&quot; or that &quot;we live skool-free<br/>\nlives&quot;. Thirteen years into this journey has left me with no tolerance for<br/>\nanything schoolish...even the explanations.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe qustions are resurfacing anew since the local (lousy) free parent<br/>\nnewspaper here in Columbus, Ohio has done a cover story on<br/>\n&quot;homeschooling&quot;...complete with only christian school-at-homers and H$LDA<br/>\nquotes and stats. I cringe every time we&#39;re lumped into that category by yet<br/>\nanother well meaning but ignorant individual who thinks we&#39;re all the same.<br/>\nSigh,<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nLori</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20438,"nextTopicId":20387}}
