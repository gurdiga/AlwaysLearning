Your telling of Simone&#39;s passing reminds me in almost every way <br/>\nof my dear companion Puiegue&#39;s passing when he was 21-1/2 years old. That <br/>\nwas two years ago, and he also passed away in my arms.  If those guys could <br/>\nhave compared notes, they probably would have had very similar stories to <br/>\ntell each other, in fact.  Puiegue (pronounced pweeg, don&#39;t ask the <br/>\norigin!) had lost his vision and would sometimes cry loudly but did not <br/>\nseem to be in pain.  He had lost a great deal of weight and seemed so <br/>\nfragile.  Sometimes he would just sit there and you might wonder if was <br/>\nsleeping sitting up.  But, you&#39;d pick him up and he could not be <br/>\nhappier.  It was at a time when we had to move from our home. I knew that <br/>\nit would be very, very hard on our dear Puiegue because we didn&#39;t know <br/>\nwhere we were going or how many moves we would have to make before we were <br/>\nactually settled, since we were down to looking at temporary housing <br/>\nsituations. Puiegue had always hating moving or even being in the car, and <br/>\nhe knew our house so well, even though he was blind.  It was hard to do, <br/>\nbut I finally found a semi-retired vet who would come out to our house and <br/>\neuthanize Puiegue.  Our sweet friend, who lived with us all his life, <br/>\npassed over peacefully in my arms, and it was one of the hardest things <br/>\nI&#39;ve ever had to do.  Liam and I still cry for him, but we know that <br/>\nPuiegue is still with us and he is free from that body which confined him so.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe comforted ourselves with the knowledge that he had a really wonderful, <br/>\nhealthy life and a loving family, and I believe that Simone did, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nLove, Marji<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  The kind vet who made the trip out to our house told us that he <br/>\ndetected tumors of some sort in Puiegue&#39;s abdomen.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 08:55 5/6/03 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;We had a very sad day yesterday.

Our cat, Simone, who was over 20 years old <br/>\ndied yesterday afternoon.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe had been sick for a while. But we did things like make a ramp to the sofa <br/>\nso she could still get up there for a while. It had become clear that it <br/>\nwasn&#39;t going to be much longer, and she stopped eating a couple days ago, <br/>\nthen almost immediately after, could no longer walk. We were also pretty sure <br/>\nthat she had lost most of her sight.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe would cry sometimes, but she didn&#39;t seem to be in pain. When we held her <br/>\nshe would purr happily and nuzzle and cuddle in. Finally, yesterday, she <br/>\nwasn&#39;t doing well, and I ended up spending all day cuddling her in my arms <br/>\n(Julian held her for a while too), and she died yesterday afternoon in my <br/>\narms.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard, because it reminds me in a lot of ways of my mother&#39;s death, which <br/>\nwas only in November. It&#39;s been a HARD year. But I lived with Simone longer <br/>\nthan I did with my mother, and I&#39;ve had her longer than I have had my son!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, we are all sad, but it seems a nice way to die, peacefully being held <br/>\nclose by someone who loves you.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14080,"nextTopicId":14151}}
