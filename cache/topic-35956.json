How do you think infants learn to talk and walk?  They <br/>\ndon&#39;t one day say, &quot;I&#39;m going to learn how to walk today.&quot;   We are <br/>\nlearning **all** the time, whether by intention or by <br/>\ndefault.  Skills have nothing to do with it!  When you&#39;re lying in a <br/>\nfield under the shadows of an oak, you&#39;re absorbing all kinds of <br/>\ninformation.  I cannot lie in a field and not ponder what kind of <br/>\nbird or insect might be making that sound or what lies out beyond the <br/>\nblue sky that I can&#39;t see or a million different things that could <br/>\npop into my mind that may have everything ~ or nothing ~ to do with <br/>\nthat setting.  You see things, you ponder them, you form opinions <br/>\nabout them, you ponder the veracity of your opinions; and, you do it <br/>\nconsciously or unconsciously.  It&#39;s all learning.  When you&#39;re making <br/>\nlove or wrestling with a wee one, you&#39;re communicating with someone <br/>\nelse, and communication *always* involves lots and lots of <br/>\nlearning.  You learn what your partner likes and/or doesn&#39;t like; you <br/>\nlearn how gentle you have to be, or not be.  You learn what *you* <br/>\nlike or don&#39;t like.<br/>\n<br/>\nI may be a big ol&#39; party pooper on Learn Nothing Day &#39;cause, for the <br/>\nlife of me, I really don&#39;t know *how* I&#39;ll participate.
