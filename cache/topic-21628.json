I&#39;d print a word on a sticky<br/>\npaper and give it to them and they&#39;d try to guess what thing it went on and<br/>\nstick it there.  We mixed some easy ones, like TV and some harder ones like<br/>\ncurtains.  It was fun.  Some children learn to read young and that&#39;s o.k. if<br/>\nthat&#39;s what they want.  Both my girls could read pretty well by the time<br/>\nthey were five and a half.  Both girls were motivated to learn to read and<br/>\nthat made it easy.  Just listen to her and don&#39;t push it, but find fun ways<br/>\nto play games that involve reading.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n*\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a>. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":95868404,"authorName":"deannaMulaly","from":"&quot;deannaMulaly&quot; &lt;deannamulaly@...&gt;","profile":"deannaMulaly","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"reading fun - seeking ideas","postDate":"1106074779","msgId":21628,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNzam1hcit1ZXY0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":21630,"prevInTime":21627,"nextInTime":21629,"topicId":21628,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi there, I ve been reading posts for a few months now and I could really use some ideas.
