To be honest I love the idea of the unschooling way, however I do plan to have other resources available for their use. My concern  is how do I address the concerns of the public eye. For example, my daughters have counselors one of them has been asking what work have we gotten done regarding education, etc. I have expressed my beliefs on natural learning, etc however it only seems to catch his eye of concern. I suppose I am not very good at getting my point acrossed or explaining what things my girls are doing that are beneficial to their learning.  Now as I have stated I do plan to use other resources such as the Internet ( www.time4learning.com), but honestly money is tight and have not had that option as of yet. Anyways I was hoping someone would be able to weed through all my gibberish, and have some advice.
