My views of Christianity are<br/>\ncloser to Buddhism and Hindu than to what many people think of as Christian.<br/>\nI just happen to have studied Jesus teachings, and think he is one of the<br/>\ngreatest examples of man on earth, but I don&#39;t think he is God, nor do I<br/>\nthink he is the only worthy example.<br/>\nMany people worship him, praise him and quote the bible.  Politicians,so-<br/>\ncalled religious institutions of old and new have exploited him, but they<br/>\ndon&#39;t really follow what he taught- like worshiping a door, but not opening<br/>\nit or walking through it.<br/>\nI don&#39;t think my soul just goes to a golden, euphoric place, but that heaven<br/>\nand hell are states of mind that are now.<br/>\nIt is  constant work for me to strive to be in,what I call, heaven - being<br/>\ngrateful, happy,appreciative, euphoric, etc. Every time a hellish thought or<br/>\nsituation enters my life, I try to counter it with a good or wait patiently<br/>\nfor a solution which always turns out to be better than what I originally<br/>\nhad planned.<br/>\nJust like in art, when something goes on the paper that seems like a<br/>\nhorrible accident, but actually turns out to be a happy new direction, or in<br/>\nmath where it seems like there is no solution, but there always is. (I<br/>\nreally loved all of the math stuff earlier on this list.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, I am starting to ramble, but Christians are  lumped together, and<br/>\nfundamentals seem to  have totally taken over the term Christian that I felt<br/>\nlike giving my perspective.<br/>\nWendy<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wew99@...\">wew99@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1831,"nextTopicId":1893}}
