We can&#39;t <br/>\nprevent it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - if you can&#39;t trust that leaning will just happen and you feel like you <br/>\nwant to make certain that specific learning happens on a particular schedule, <br/>\nthen at least watching movies and doing science experiments is NICER than <br/>\nreading a boring textbook and answering stupid questions at the ends of the <br/>\nchapters.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is remotely possible that you&#39;ll start to trust that learning can &quot;just <br/>\nhappen&quot; out of the activities the kids choose to do and that you don&#39;t need <br/>\nto pick certain movies to make sure that they cover certain parts of history <br/>\nor plan certain science experiments to make sure they learn particular <br/>\nscientific concepts. But it is really that &quot;trust&quot; that makes unschooling <br/>\nunschooling - not so much what you and the kids are doing. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I say, &quot;Hey, Rosie, wanna play some games from the Family Math book?&quot; <br/>\nShe&#39;ll say, &quot;Sure.&quot; We play them because they&#39;re fun - not to learn some <br/>\nparticular skill that I&#39;ve decided it is time for her to learn. It is NO <br/>\ndifferent than if I say, &quot;Hey Rosie, wanna play FLUX or UNO or whatever....&quot; <br/>\nShe&#39;ll say, &quot;Sure&quot; if she wants to or &quot;Not now&quot; if she doesn&#39;t or maybe , &quot;I <br/>\ndon&#39;t really LIKE that game, let&#39;s play something else.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - here we might have a parent-led activity that comes right out of a math <br/>\nbook - but it would still be unschooling because of the INTENT. The intent is <br/>\nto have a good time. We LIKE lots of the family math games - Rosie and I <br/>\nhappen to LOVE strategy games.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t probably ASK either of my other daughters if they wanted to play <br/>\nthose games - they don&#39;t like those kinds of games. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m not making Rosie play them in an underhanded attempt to make her learn <br/>\nsomething. I&#39;m TRULY just offering to play a fun game because we both enjoy <br/>\nit - the LEARNING happens because learning always happens and we can&#39;t <br/>\nprevent it.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pamS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6796,"nextTopicId":6716}}
