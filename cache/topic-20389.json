Yes. *Something* is wrong. But nothing is REALLY wrong, <br/>\nmeaning VERY wrong. See my original, carefully chosen wording please.<br/>\n**********I wasn&#39;t trying to be cute.<br/>\nI will attempt to be clearer, nothing is really wrong TO YOU. To the child, <br/>\nthe end of a movie IS *really* wrong. Saying goodbye to something, whether it <br/>\nis Grandma going home after a stay, a gently caught toad int eh yard that has <br/>\nto be release, or Elmo &quot;leaving the room&quot;, can be extremely difficult and <br/>\nemotionally wrenching.<br/>\nTo the one experiencing the emotion, it is REAL.************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is not in physical pain from an injury. She is not starving. She is <br/>\nnot scared. She is not lonely or neglected. <br/>\n******* she may well be lonely for Elmo*********<br/>\nI am there for her if she <br/>\nwants a hug.<br/>\n**********Maybe she is crying because she really wants a hug, from <br/>\nElmo************** <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the reason why DH found her outburst amusing and cute, rather <br/>\nthan disturbing, is because he knew nothing MAJOR was wrong. If she fell <br/>\nand smashed her head open on the concrete steps in front of our house, <br/>\nhis response to her crying (and her cry itself) would have been much <br/>\ndifferent.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vijay<br/>\n************Of course! <br/>\nI myself have had to hide quite a few grins from my kids, but as my <br/>\nunderstanding of them grows, so does my empathy towrd their feelings. I believe that in <br/>\ntheir minds, at the beginning of their emotion, when they first realized <br/>\nwhatever it may be that is upsetting them, this issue *is* major. It hurts. They <br/>\nare crying. To me, that isn&#39;t really amusing anymore.<br/>\nClear as mud, huh? :o)<br/>\nElissa Jill<br/>\nLife&#39;s challenges are not supposed to paralyze you;<br/>\nThey&#39;re supposed to help you discover who you are. <br/>\n~Bernice Johnson Reagon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20358,"nextTopicId":20390}}
