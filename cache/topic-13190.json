I have friends who feel that certain parts of <br/>\ntheir lives should be VERY conservative, because they do have an alternative <br/>\nlifestyle.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe New Mexico homeschooling list is a fragile and boring little thing, <br/>\nbecause the structured folks are defensive and don&#39;t want the taint from the <br/>\nwild ones.  There aren&#39;t so many activities in town for homeschoolers these <br/>\ndays.  There&#39;s a Harry Potter Tournament Thursday afternoons, and so a more <br/>\nconservative group put a park-meeting playgroup on Thursday at the same time, <br/>\ntwo miles from there (in a town 15+ miles across and deep).  It was pointed <br/>\nout on the list that it was a conflict.  Nobody said &quot;NO, it&#39;s a PROTEST.&quot;  <br/>\nNobody even said &quot;Oh, *really*?&quot; So every week we get a reminder about that <br/>\nplaygroup meeting.  And every week Holly and her buds go play Harry Potter.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I am getting to a point, honest.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone new came on and asked &quot;What curriculum to you all use and why?&quot;  I <br/>\ngave a mild unschooing answer and got JUMPED by a couple or three people <br/>\nsaying I was ALWAYS blah blah blah.  That list doesn&#39;t usually even get one <br/>\npost per DAY, and I rarely say anything about unschooling.  It&#39;s one of the <br/>\nlamest lists ever, but has its use when a law changes or there&#39;s a change of <br/>\ndisplays at the museum, y&#39;know?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo time passed, it was quiet, and someone new came on wanting to aggressively <br/>\norganize a pre-school co-op at her house, parents help on a schedule, <br/>\nvegetarian organic lunches, they would pay her a bit and help or pay her more <br/>\nif not helping, very Prussian organization altogether, more forward  and <br/>\norganized than the list was used to, but I hung back and said nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone inquired lightly about her beliefs (didn&#39;t say &quot;are you Christian?&quot; <br/>\nbut that was the question, I think) and someone else said it wasn&#39;t really <br/>\nlegal to run a school from a home in New Mexico, and so what was she wanting <br/>\nto charge money for?   <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, very vague and tentative kind of communication.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe woman came back on and said (I THINK, maybe I should just go find it) she <br/>\nwas living with her two husbands and their son, one husband is Black, they <br/>\nwant to emphasize racial acceptance, yammered on a bit, and I could feel the <br/>\nconservatives withering and the &#39;new age&#39; faction covering their eyes and <br/>\nshaking their heads slowly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a great long silence.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI never volunteered to her any personal information or support, not even on <br/>\nthe side, because although her marital/sexual stuff doesn&#39;t bother me in the <br/>\nleast,  her intent to run a school and call it homeschooling really DID <br/>\nbother me.  And her oblivion about first discovering who was on the list and <br/>\nwhat they felt about even hanging out with unschoolers, let alone alternative <br/>\nhedonists, was amusing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for a change I observed in silent amusement.  It was like watching a very <br/>\nslow-motion flower-cart wreck in the set for the marketplace  of the recent <br/>\nDisney version of Roger&#39;s and Hammerstein Cinderella.  All cartoon-colorful <br/>\nand fantasy-worldly, with no soundtrack.  Flowers fly up and the picture <br/>\nfreezes without it even mattering where they fall or what happens next.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Joylyn&#39;s weekend","postDate":"1049209829","msgId":13190,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVmLjM3NmJlZThmLjJiYmIwNWU1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":13192,"prevInTime":13189,"nextInTime":13191,"topicId":13190,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... forgotten how totally unmainstream I have become.
