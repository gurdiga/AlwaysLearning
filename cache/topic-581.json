I&#39;m really <br/>\nfine with all this.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all have to make choices, and after years of putting up with her and <br/>\nmaking myself miserable, I finally decided it was best for everyone if I just <br/>\nbecame a bitch to her and her alone. Works like a charm. I DO miss seeing my <br/>\nDad as often, but we work that out. <br/>\n<br/>\nWould it break my heart if my boys followed suit and cut ties with me? You <br/>\nbetcha! But I&#39;ve made it very clear to them WHY I&#39;ve done this (and that they <br/>\ncan carry on any relationship they want with her---or none at all). And I try <br/>\nmy best to be the best mom I can be for THEM---and NOT the very best showcase <br/>\nmother, looking for the accolades of the other society mothers. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a lot easier when we lived abroad or across the country, but living in <br/>\nthe same town is impossible!<br/>\n<br/>\nShe followed ALL of Rosemond&#39;s advise (even before there WAS a <br/>\nRosemond)---and look where it got her!<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, I call her Nancy or Mother when I mention her at all. My Dad is <br/>\nDaddy, Papa or Pop. My boys call him Opa ( the #1 son was born in Germany) or <br/>\nPa (#2 son couldn&#39;t &quot;do&quot; the first syllable long ago---kinda&#39; sounds like <br/>\nwhat Opie called Andy---Paw). Papa loves both! I called my grandmothers <br/>\n&quot;Doolie&quot; and &quot;Ganny&quot;---early attempts at Julia and Granny.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was Mommy until they got a certain age, then it became Mom. I miss &quot;Mommy&quot; <br/>\nsometimes. <br/>\n<br/>\nKelly</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":578,"nextTopicId":541}}
