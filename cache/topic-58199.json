Paul wants to tell Michael that he is not aloud to say anything about our parenting.==== <br/>\n<br/>\nHow does Logan feel about having his uncle in the house for an extended visit?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter has trouble with changes to her home space. For example, moving furniture around, even for specific needs like her birthday party that she has agreed to and wants to do, is often accompanied by stress reactions - crankiness, impatience, demanding attitude - for a while until she gets used to it. She will say a lot of &quot;I hate this. Change it back now!&quot; ...&quot;Well it has to go back the minute the party is over.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nShe also finds the transition with James coming home from work hard sometimes - not always welcoming immediately even when she knows he&#39;s coming and is pleased. She grumps at him and wants him to go to the bedroom (we only have two spaces in the apartment) until suddenly she is happy and wants to have a wrestle with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has been this way for a long time, and I try to keep calm and neutral in reaction to her. And after a time, increasingly briefer as she gets older, she becomes calm and pleasant. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut to an outsider, not understanding what was going on with her, how hard some things are for her, she would just look like the most horribly rude brat.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I&#39;m being pessimistic. I think in your place, I&#39;d be ready to run interference. I&#39;d be ready for changes in Logan&#39;s behavior and perhaps greater neediness from him. <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with the idea of leaving some reading material out. Perhaps include some that is &quot;scientific&quot; as it were - stuff about child development, some of the newest pro-media articles.

He most likely has his own childhood damage from which to recover - maybe even unrealized. I think I&#39;d try to get him talking about his childhood. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would also add that if it does come down to the laying down of guidelines to Michael, that perhaps Paul is the better person to do it, than you. If it were your sister coming, I would say the reverse.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
