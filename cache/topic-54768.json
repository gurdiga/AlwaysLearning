If so, maybe helping her to pursue her interests will help her to feel more capable in other areas. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy own 7-yr old dd sounds very similar to yours. Her current passions are singing and gymnastics. I try to provide her with a lot of focused attention on these two interests in simple ways--filming videos of her singing, which we upload to the computer and she then watches over and over. I help her to practice her gymnastics at home, we jump on the trampoline together, and I volunteered to lead younger kids&#39; classes at the gym so that I&#39;m physically present while she is working with her coach. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m trying to be more patient, loving, and understanding but then it seems like sometimes it all bottles up and I explode.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Are you trying to change your parenting methods too rapidly?  Maybe be gentle on yourself and know that change takes time. As much as one may want to become a &quot;perfect&quot;/mindful/gentle parent immediately, it takes work, and an understanding that there is no perfect. I have found that shifting my own reactions takes a lot of practice.  Knowing where I want to be is half the work. Practicing my manner of communication is the other half...at least that&#39;s how it seems for me these days! Kids provide us with endless opportunities to practice!  <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Because of her behavior...&lt;&lt;&lt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think it would help to try to not focus on behavior, and make a really concerted effort to figure out what things trigger frustration for her.  Help her to understand the triggers, and then try to set up an environment where you can work to eliminate the ones that you can.  My daughter is also very sensitive and had recently been having big, fearful reactions to bees. For example, if we were taking a walk or on a picnic and a bee flies near her, she would suddenly blurt out that we HAVE TO GO HOME NOW!!! Regardless of who we were with, or how far of a walk home. We have been talking and reading a lot lately about bees and their importance to our food supply, and talking about what endangers bees, and the bee industry and how aspects of it may be stressing bees. In the last several weeks she has become less reactive and will sometimes not even notice them. Working to helping her understand the role bees play in the environment has seemed to help deactivate the stressor...at least a little bit.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Am I making her feel more responsible, for her behavior by not punishing or rewarding? Is there a way to &quot;ease away&quot; from that kind of parenting?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I imagine that she is not necessarily feeling more responsible, but maybe she is feeling confused. If you&#39;ve made rapid, and big changes in the way you react and communicate with your kids, have you talked to them individually about why you&#39;re changing? Maybe she is uncertain if you&#39;ll react one way vs. another way, and that may be causing bigger reaction/frustration for her.  I always find it helpful to be honest.  If I react in a manner that is less than helpful, I apologize as soon as I can and tell my kids that I&#39;ll try harder to not react in yucky ways.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBooks that have helped me are How to Talk so Kids will Listen, and Listen so Kids will Talk; Siblings without Rivalry; Raising our Children, Raising Ourselves; and Unconditional Parenting. None of these books are Unschooling books, but they were like stepping stones for me when I was seeking to move away from the parenting style I grew up with and working towards becoming the parent I want to be. While they do tend to be geared towards  young children, I think there is value in there applicable to children of all ages.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":435001304,"authorName":"debbiernoll","from":"&quot;debbiernoll&quot; &lt;debbiernoll@...&gt;","profile":"debbiernoll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Transitioning from traditional parenting to unschooling","postDate":"1276214232","msgId":54839,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGh1cnU0bytzcXU1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDU2MjI0Mi4zODEzNC5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwOC5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":54821,"nextInTopic":54858,"prevInTime":54838,"nextInTime":54840,"topicId":54768,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"===The angry response, the frustrated response, the storming response, none of those had any positive effect.

It may be that it was developmental more than it is about changing parenting tactics. What helped me a lot was to recognize that it wasn&#39;t personal, it wasn&#39;t about me. Being kind and constant, present, aware, and making sure that there were lots of the basics available. Food readily available, comfort, sleep, those things near to hand made it much easier. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was hard, I can remember walking through downtown Norwich and crying one day after I&#39;d spent the morning dealing with a daughter who was sure that everyone hated her and that she was horrible and would be better off dead. She was sure that her brother was better at all things than she was and a lot of her anger was directed at him. I had to be very present, I couldn&#39;t go off and do something on my own in another room at all. And Simon would get really hurt, he hates tension and he would shrink into this little pile of misery at the first moment of it. That made it even harder for me to be gentle with Linnaea. But the gentle response was the only response that helped. The angry response, the frustrated response, the storming response, none of those had any positive effect.
