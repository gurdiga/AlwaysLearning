Yesterday, he said he wanted to go <br/>\nfor a long bike ride, and asked me to pack him a lunch and something <br/>\nto drink, which i did. I also gave him some money in case he wanted <br/>\nto buy something to eat instead. And my cell phone in case he needed <br/>\nto talk. So off he went. <br/>\n<br/>\nLater, he came in with a box of left-over Chinese food. He said he <br/>\ndecided to go to Shong-Hey instead(its our local family owned <br/>\nchinese place, been there since i was a kid, the only egg rolls i&#39;ve <br/>\never had anywhere made with bean sprouts instead of cabbage. Its <br/>\nabout a mile down the road.)He told me they offered him a kid&#39;s <br/>\nmenu, but he just wanted chicken and brocolli, he sat at a booth and <br/>\nhad lunch by himself. He also said he got a really good fortune <br/>\n(when we go together, he doesnt like to read his fortune) &quot;A good <br/>\nthing will happen soon for your family&quot;. He said he took the bike <br/>\npath through the park on the way there, and noticed seven ducks in <br/>\nthe river (which is really just a drainage ditch)...and &quot;seven is a <br/>\nlucky number!And there are NEVER ducks there!&quot; So he was feeling <br/>\nvery positive about the whole trip. <br/>\n<br/>\nLater he was retelling this whole story to my sister, and she <br/>\nasked &quot;Did ya leave a tip?&quot; My heart kind of sank, because i thought <br/>\nhe surely forgot. But this is what he said instead: &quot;Yeah, i only <br/>\nleft a dollar. But my meal was just over $5, so i figured a dollar <br/>\nis 20 percent right? So i thought that would be enough.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWell. I mustve told him at some point about tips, about leaving 10-<br/>\n20 percent. Or maybe he just noticed that, since we go out to eat <br/>\nalot, and i talk alot about everything we do. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo i felt very proud. Yes, proud that my son knew, in a real-world <br/>\nsituation, what 20 percent of his bill would be. But more than that, <br/>\ni was proud that he was confident enough to eat in a restaurant by <br/>\nhimself (i *never* wouldve done that at his age! Probably not even <br/>\nnow.), that he was observant enough to see the beauty in seven good <br/>\nluck ducks swimming in the park, and that he was thoughtful enough <br/>\nto even leave a tip. And to top it all off my very forgetful &quot;in the <br/>\nmoment&quot; boy didnt even forget his backpack at the restaurant. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m so looking forward to his teenage years! I think its just gonna <br/>\nget better and better. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKatherine</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26162,"nextTopicId":26165}}
