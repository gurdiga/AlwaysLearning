Stated broadly.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore specifically, looking closely at how choice and decision-making work<br/>\ncan go a long way toward greater and greater clarity. There&#39;s always more! I<br/>\nlearn more everyday about that.It is amazing to me the range of choice one<br/>\nmay have and not even realize it!<br/>\n<br/>\nI would even go so far as to say that for me, the above is central to<br/>\ngetting &quot;it.&quot; And from what I&#39;ve seen, it&#39;s central for many others too.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, Jan 14, 2011 at 10:03 AM, Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I was asked a question by a new unschooler with another connection to me,<br/>\n&gt; and here&#39;s my last response:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ** There&#39;s a group of moms [in that part of the world] who do a kind of<br/>\n&gt; splinter sect (as it were... &quot;sect&quot; is a bad word for it...) of unschooling,<br/>\n&gt; and they use the terms &quot;consensual&quot; a lot, and &quot;autonomy.&quot; I bet their kids<br/>\n&gt; are fine, but the terms are problematical for the way I (and many who hang<br/>\n&gt; out with me) discuss it.
