(this is why I am an<br/>\ninterminable lurker - I&#39;m almost never actually caught up and by the<br/>\ntime I would get around to writing a reply, lots of others have beat me<br/>\nto it) (an intro is coming up, honest)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s what we&#39;ve done to grow crystals. We haven&#39;t used one of those<br/>\nkits, so haven&#39;t got any advice about those. They look pretty neat. What<br/>\na bummer that they didn&#39;t work for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nGet some borax, colored pipe cleaners, a pencil, ribbon and a glass jar<br/>\nor can. (make sure the glass jar has a mouth that is big enough, though,<br/>\nor you might have to break the jar to get the crystal out.  :-o )<br/>\n<br/>\nGet the pipe cleaner ready by shaping it - spirals, hearts, stars,<br/>\nwhatever -  then using the ribbon (or whatever else might look nice to<br/>\nhang it from), tie it to the pencil so it will hang down into the jar or<br/>\ncan. (but don&#39;t put it in the jar yet) Put some boiling water into the<br/>\njar and mix in borax a bit at a time, constantly stirring until it stops<br/>\ndissolving. It took quite a bit in a peanut butter jar though. (The<br/>\namount of borax reaches some kind of limit in the solution - what&#39;s that<br/>\ncalled -  saturation?) Then hang the pipe cleaner from the pencil across<br/>\nthe top of the jar. Make sure there is enough room around the pipe<br/>\ncleaner in all directions (and that it&#39;s deep enough) for the crystals<br/>\nto grow. I don&#39;t remember exactly how long it takes, but let it sit and<br/>\nin a couple/few days you&#39;ll have crystals growing on the pipe cleaner.<br/>\nIt makes a very nice (but very heavy) christmas ornament and looks nice<br/>\nhanging in a window too.<br/>\n<br/>\nUh-oh, this took too long, the intro will have to wait... :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlice</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2364,"nextTopicId":2344}}
