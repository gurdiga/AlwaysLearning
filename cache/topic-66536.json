Little boys can get an erection when they need to pee.  When he was in pull ups he didn&#39;t notice the erection.  Just let him know this might be a sign from his body that he might need to go to the bathroom and it&#39;s not a big deal.  Also, if his underwear are too loose then it might be an irritation and be uncomfortable.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] little boy ...

Increasingly, as they years go on, none of your business. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nPast telling him it&#39;s normal, ask him not to hurt himself, to be more gentle, and to touch himself where other people aren&#39;t present.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I have told him that being a little boy it will get longer every now and then, and then will go away.<br/>\nWhich I guess was the wrong thing to say, because then he responded with he wanted to be a girl then. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not about being a little boy.  It&#39;s about having a penis. <br/>\nIf he was a girl, you might mention, he would get feelings too, that might feel odd or itch.  Very matter of factly.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Could you do that in your room, please?&quot; might be a thing to say.  (I&#39;ve said that, years back.)<br/>\nBut about &quot;very upset,&quot; I can remember my kids being frustrated at getting older, getting bigger, and wanting to avoid it.  Perhaps you could baby him a bit for a while.  Make foods he really liked when he was a bit younger, rock him or read to him or whatever he might associate with being two years old.  That&#39;s just a guess, in case it&#39;s a phase of awareness of changing and growing and he&#39;s wishing to still be younger.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy boys are grown, but maybe there&#39;s a kids&#39; book out and current about it penises, but he might not want to have his mom read it to him.  Depends on the relationship and all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":511640869,"authorName":"Brad & Stacey Propst","from":"&quot;Brad & Stacey Propst&quot; &lt;bradnstaceypropst@...&gt;","profile":"whisperingwindsacademy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"little boy ...
