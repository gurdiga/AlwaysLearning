If anyone is in the Atlanta area, it might <br/>\ninterest you. I received their free curriculum supplement on the topic, <br/>\nand it is quite good, as are all their supplements. And, they are FREE!<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n<br/>\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) invites you to a FREE two-hour<br/>\nworkshop in Atlanta, Georgia:<br/>\n<br/>\nAlcohol Abuse and Alcoholism: It\u0019s not just Health Anymore<br/>\n<br/>\nThe workshop will be held Friday, November 7 from 1:00 pm to 3:00 pm in<br/>\nthe Birch Room of the Omni Hotel at the CNN Center. The hotel is next<br/>\nto the convention center where the National Middle School Association<br/>\nis meeting.<br/>\n<br/>\nParticipants receive a FREE copy of &quot;Understanding Alcohol:<br/>\nInvestigations into Biology and Behavior,&quot; the latest NIH curriculum<br/>\nsupplement for grades 7-8.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo attend the workshop, please respond to Jason Lazarow,<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jlazarow@...\">jlazarow@...</a> or 301-435-8043.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis workshop explores our misunderstandings about alcohol and how our<br/>\nbodies metabolize alcohol. Virtual mouse experiments allow students to<br/>\ntest genetic and environmental factors that determine the respond to<br/>\nalcohol. Hands-on activities examine alcohol consumption in humans and<br/>\nhow individual reactions vary. Finally, a computer-based simulation<br/>\nshows how alcohol impairs the ability to drive. These lessons are<br/>\nspecifically designed for the middle school science classroom.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your interest in the NIH curriculum supplements. We look<br/>\nforward to seeing you on November 7.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\n<br/>\nBruce Fuchs, Ph.D.<br/>\nDirector<br/>\nNIH Office of Science Education<br/>\n<br/>\nref: 2243</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16943,"nextTopicId":16907}}
