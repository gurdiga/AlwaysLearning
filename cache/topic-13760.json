A good <br/>\nexample would be that my sil who&#39;s single w/ one dd was dating a not <br/>\nvery nice dentist.  Mil told her she should stick with him even though <br/>\nhe was a jerk because he was a &quot;doctor&quot; and had money.  Not advice I <br/>\nwant someone giving my daughters!  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe really don&#39;t have anyone else who want to take on this many children <br/>\n(4 so far).  We have large life insurance policies to guarantee they <br/>\nwould be provided for monetarily.  Anyway, I guess I just have to let it <br/>\ngo and not worry about it.  Live in the now.

I wouldn&#39;t bother if she lived in FL <br/>\nall year, but here in Wayland, we can see their house from ours and with <br/>\ndh and fil now business partners, we&#39;re going to be together a lot.  So <br/>\nI stayed up last night and made a list I could e-mail for her to read <br/>\nand printed out some more articles.  I have 3 John Holt books and I want <br/>\nto get some of John Gatto&#39;s work.  Any other persuasive material you <br/>\ncould suggest, I would appreciate it.  Anything from well-known people <br/>\nwould be appreciated.  She respects someone&#39;s thoughts more if they are <br/>\nfamous.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mil is one of those people who LOVES to talk and talk and just knows <br/>\neverything.

This from a woman who sent her children to her <br/>\nmother for whole summers to take care of (just down the street as well) <br/>\nand who would go on 1-2 months long vacations leaving her children with <br/>\na paid house sitter.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh well.  I did expect it.  I&#39;m sure you have all been there.  Now I <br/>\njust have to gather as much info as I can for backup.  That way I really <br/>\nwon&#39;t have to &quot;say&quot; anything but, &quot;here, read this.&quot;  As least that way <br/>\nshe can&#39;t ever try to use my own words against me or take something I <br/>\nsaid out of context.
