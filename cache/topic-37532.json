So<br/>\ni get just 2 colors like yellow and blue in larggish tubs adn take on a wall<br/>\nwith the kids.  lots of splash and fun.  This is possible in a balcony too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso tearing pages out of magazines is fun for my younger one.  the older<br/>\none pretends that each page is something to be attacked.. and goes for them<br/>\nwith gusto and a scissor.  Also can be glued within a shape.  DD loves<br/>\nelephants... so i draw a large elephant on a poster sheet and then we stick<br/>\nas many magazine pages , cut and otherwise, within that shape. and of course<br/>\nmany a time they invent their own games once the materials are beign used in<br/>\nthe way i perceive :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter loves stitching, rolling wool into a ball and also cutting up<br/>\nwool.... so does my older one.  so i&#39;ve made them a seperate stitch box...<br/>\nsome buttons, zippers, large plastic/metal needles and tons of wool.  the<br/>\nwool fits thru the large needle.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso i have kept a couple of those largish 365 days a year activity books<br/>\naround.  sometimes i rifle thru it to get inspiration.  they are available<br/>\nat some point or the other on sale at Borders (book store that was nearest<br/>\nme when in NJ)  and this way i dont&#39; have to open the comp and search.  this<br/>\nseems to bug my kids.... they don&#39;t mind me being on the phone... but if i&#39;m<br/>\nglued to the screen then it bothers them.  so books are easier right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a large box of beads (that needs to get refilled soon)... this gets<br/>\nused a lot by my daughter.  we keep plenty of pipe cleaners for her to<br/>\nstring them onto... and older one often uses the beads in his large cement<br/>\nmixer and dump truck.<br/>\n<br/>\nhope something from the above leads to something for you and your children.<br/>\npeace, hema<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, Aug 26, 2008 at 7:58 AM, Verna &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lalow@...\">lalow@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   does anyone have some quick links to fun, fairly cheap activitity<br/>\n&gt; ideas. preferably things I can do here at home with the kids (with 4<br/>\n&gt; 3 to 6 year olds we do better at home right now). we are having alot<br/>\n&gt; more fun this past week, just hanging out, but i think they would<br/>\n&gt; enjoy a little more variety choices than our normal stuff and havnt<br/>\n&gt; had much luck with google tonight. thanks!
