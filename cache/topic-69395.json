I read both links and found a lot of love and inspiration there. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am a big fan of Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead and often find them to be very profound and inspiring:<br/>\n<br/>\nLike in Scarlet Begonias: &quot;Sometimes you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nUncle John&#39;s Band: &quot;Ain&#39;t no time to hate... barely time to wait!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRipple:  Dang, the whole darn song is a piece of poetry... &quot;Ripple in still water, when there is no pebble tossed... no wind to blow...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI only learned about unschooling a couple of months ago and our lives have have changed tremendously in that time.  When I first read about it I was considering homeschooling and I felt very drawn to this approach although I really could not quite comprehend it.  I decided to just start walking down this mysterious path in hopes that someday, way down the road, things would start to clarify in my mind.  I have already had so many exciting moments where a big realization suddenly clicks into place in my mind.  I feel so much calmer and more peaceful inside.  The amazing thing is watching how this Ripples through my family.  We are all experiencing profound change and I just wanted to take a moment out of my busy, thought filled day to give my deepest, sincerest thanks to those of you who have been such passionate angels in opening up your lives and your minds for the benefit of the rest of us.  It is a very beautiful thing that you do and you are changing the world.  You have just completely changed the world for this family.  So thank you, thank you, from the bottom of our hearts, for your selflessness and beauty.  We all love you very much.  Ripple on ladies!!    <br/>\n<br/>\n-Cass<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Spirituality, Virtues… stuff like that","postDate":"1350965503","msgId":69395,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENDQTFCNTA4LUU2RTctNDRGOS05NTlELTNBOEM1MUZCNTdCNEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":69400,"prevInTime":69394,"nextInTime":69396,"topicId":69395,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I pulled a story from one of my SCA pages and cleaned it up for unschooler use. http://sandradodd.com/humility There is new art and a new link for this page: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1708113668\">I pulled a story from one of my SCA pages and cleaned it up for unschooler use.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/humility\">http://sandradodd.com/humility</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThere is new art and a new link for this page:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/spirituality\">http://sandradodd.com/spirituality</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve had several reasons, over the past week, to remember that life can become more complicated than it needs to be.
