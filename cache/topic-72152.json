So, if his work schedule allows it, he stays up with us.  One thing that he has done since living with others in grad school is wear soft ear plugs.  He likes them even if it&#39;s pretty quiet in the house.  He says he gets a deeper sleep.  I certainly wouldn&#39;t suggest your husband *should* wear ear plugs, but he may like to try them if he hasn&#39;t thought of that option.  He might not like them though.  I don&#39;t.  I prefer a background noise like a fan.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I am looking for ideas on gentle ways to wake them&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve asked my son how he likes to be awakened.  Certain sounds make him anxious if he is just waking up.  He likes soft sounds like a quiet voice.  He also likes music, so if I need to wake him, I sit and talk with him a while, then put on some favourite song.  He&#39;s a very slow riser.  I wake up, and jump up.  Doug is in between.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDoug and I have a zen clock which has a chime that dings softly every few minutes, slowly getting more frequent.  Ethan likes that too.  Doug prefers his iphone.  I like to wake to the sounds of people.  Best to ask your kids what they prefer, as Joyce suggests.

Thanks!-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my kids wanted to stay up, the deal was, from the very first time, ONLY if you&#39;re very quiet.  If you can&#39;t be quiet, you need to go to sleep.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m very sorry that unschooling came to be associated with the idea that it wasn&#39;t okay to tell kids to let other people sleep, period.  I&#39;m sorry that people have encouraged others to think that a child had &quot;a right&quot; to stay up as long as he wanted to.  It makes no logical sense.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your house is very small, you might not get to let kids stay up later until they&#39;re quite a bit older.  Having four awake at once isn&#39;t a good idea, as you&#39;re seeing. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re up with them, then be responsible for keeping the activities silent or in whispers.  If they&#39;re unable to understand why, and to be able to do that, then there&#39;s no advantage or benefit to being awake, and there are disadvantages to them, to your husband, to your relationship and to the family.  That&#39;s big.  That&#39;s bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo wake them up, you could put music or a movie on, cook bacon or something that smells good, open curtains...  When a child was very much asleep and had asked me to wake him or her up, I would sit on the bed, hold his hand and talk to him.  &quot;It&#39;s 8:00.  You wanted to wake up.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you need to create a reason to get up, take them out to breakfast, or to a morning showing of a movie, or to a breakfast picnic, or to the zoo early enough to see morning feedings or something.  At least until you can get the schedule readjusted, having a place to go in the morning might help.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t forget your husband&#39;s needs.   Divorce is WAY worse for kids than a bedtime for a good reason.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAvoiding arbitrary rules doesn&#39;t preclude having sensible practices based on what&#39;s really needed at your house.  Going to bed at 7:00 because a kid is six years old is arbitrary.  Going to bed at 9:00 because dad needs to get up at 5:00 an if he doesn&#39;t sleep well he might not be safe to drive or to do ihis job isn&#39;t the least bit arbitrary.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child really doesn&#39;t like going to sleep when others do, he might then, down the line, be willing to be really quiet for the privilege of staying up a while more.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Help with adjusting sleep times","postDate":"1378822827","msgId":72153,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExQ0FCNTcyLUE0RUYtNDRERC04ODc1LTQ3MkVGMjk4QTEzNEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGwwbWZzZisxbW9hcWQ2QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGwwbWZzZisxbW9hcWQ2QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":72152,"nextInTopic":72154,"prevInTime":72152,"nextInTime":72154,"topicId":72152,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Have you asked your kids for ideas?

I am looking for \nideas on gentle ways to wake them or for some alternative I am missing. \nAs much as there have been a lot of positives to our late nights, and \nhopefully it will be possible again when they are older, for now it \nseems in order for me to best support them at their developmental stage \nand still be respectful to my hubby, I need to find some way to adjust \nour sleep times.
