Oops--it�s not called <br/>\nhalftime in baseball, is it? Maybe it was before the game. Anyway, there <br/>\nwas a long table set up and about 10 people sat at it with big chocolate <br/>\ncream pies in front of each of them.  They were given a pie-server <br/>\n(those metal  triangular things with a handle) and the first person to <br/>\nshovel in a whole pie won the contest.<br/>\n<br/>\nEric started �eating� and ended up cutting the corners of his mouth with <br/>\nthe server. He suddenly realized he was sitting there before hundreds of <br/>\npeople acting like a pig and bleeding onto his chocolate pie (the <br/>\nwhipped cream on top supplied a nice white canvas for the red blood). He <br/>\nwas disgusted with himself and humiliated and still doesn�t like to <br/>\nthink about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe left for his Australian adventure a couple of days ago, btw. He�s <br/>\ndriving across the country to L.A. to catch the plane. The morning he <br/>\nleft he had planned on getting up about 4:30 a.m. and taking off about <br/>\n5:30 a.m. We went to bed around midnight and he couldn�t sleep at all. I <br/>\nwoke up at 1:30 a.m. to find him fully dressed and almost ready to go. <br/>\nHe drove 15 hours straight that day w/o having slept a wink.  Adrenaline <br/>\nkept him going, I guess--that or my will.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5111,"nextTopicId":5125}}
