I know<br/>\nit sounds bad and hard but that&#39;s how I feel. I really want and desire to<br/>\nbe happy with them but it seems impossible: When I&#39;m playing cards or<br/>\nwhatever with the 2 oldest my 4 year old comes and bothers us or destroys<br/>\nwhat we are doing. I feel bad because I prefer being with the older one&#39;s<br/>\nas I enjoy myself more doing the kind of things they like doing: Board<br/>\ngames, reading to them, chess, sewing, cooking... I&#39;m getting tired of<br/>\n&quot;baby&quot; games and I don&#39;t play much with my 4 year old any more. It&#39;s just<br/>\nthat I&#39;m tired of that sort of games and I would love her to more on... I<br/>\nnow her needs are not being met and I feel bad about that. I would like to<br/>\nbe with the 3 of them at a time without any &quot;problems&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been reading some books about mindful parenting so as to get started<br/>\nagain and I do but after a sort while I get tired of being with her as much<br/>\nas she needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nYvonne Laborda.<br/>\nwww.welivelearning.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70590,"nextTopicId":70592}}
