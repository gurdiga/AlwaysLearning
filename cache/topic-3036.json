We&#39;ve pretty much decided<br/>\non family/stability over schooling. I hate that the decision comes down to<br/>\nthat, but siblings include one in Germany, a school-at-home family with<br/>\nstrict discipline and spankings, and a public school family with great kids<br/>\nand even tempers. If we pick a sibling, it&#39;ll be the public school people,<br/>\neven though my kids would be in ps, because I think the environment is<br/>\nbetter. Recently our closest friends have started hsing, and I tried to loan<br/>\nher a couple of books on unschooling but it made her too nervous. I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow if they&#39;d be an option or not. I really don&#39;t know any unschoolers IRL,<br/>\nwhich is why I&#39;m here!<br/>\n<br/>\nMattie<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi All:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; DH and I were just having a conversation about needing to change the<br/>\n&gt; guardians of our children in our Will...  We would want someone who would<br/>\n&gt; let the kids still homeschool and the current guardians (my parents) would<br/>\n&gt; have them in public school so fast you&#39;re head would spin..
