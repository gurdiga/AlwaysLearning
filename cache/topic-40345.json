Thank you for","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1939587005\">I have never posted before but I have gleaned a plethora of wonderful <br/>\nideas and insights from this group.  So first I want to say thank <br/>\nyou.  Thank you for helping me change my perspective.  Thank you for <br/>\nenlightening me.  Thank you for helping me want to be a better mother.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a dilemna that I would like to put out there for some <br/>\nresponses.  About a year ago my oldest son (10y at the time) made <br/>\nfriends with a neighborhood boy.  The boy is a bit of a &quot;loose <br/>\ncannon&quot;.  He was easily angered, very loud, used foul language, <br/>\ntaunted the younger kids, and often playing would turn into an <br/>\nargument with both parties storming off.  I sat him down and <br/>\nexpressed my desire to have a secure, loving environment.  I told him <br/>\nfoul language was not something we used, yelling and hollering at one <br/>\nanother was not something we did and taunting, pushing, hitting was <br/>\nnot  how we handled our anger.  He agreed to control himself and I <br/>\ntold him he could continue to come over.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the next few months things seemed to get better with just a few <br/>\nincidents.  Fast forward to this summer.  It seemed that overnight he <br/>\nbecame this volatile, angry young man.  Everytime he came over one of <br/>\nmy children ended up in tears.  I had finally gotten to a point where <br/>\nI despised having him come up to the door to ask if the kids could <br/>\nplay.  I had spoken with his mother about his relationship with my <br/>\nkids, especially the oldest, but she was quite taken aback and seems <br/>\njust as volatile as he is.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally one day my son and him began fist fighting.  I broke it up <br/>\nand sent him home.  Then my son broke down and poured out his heart <br/>\nto me.  He told me that this boy had said horrible things about me <br/>\nand my other children and had been doing so for awhile.  My son told <br/>\nme that he did not want to be friends with him and he knew that this <br/>\nwas not the type of friendship he wanted.  So, dh, myself and our son <br/>\nsat down discussed the issue and we all agreed that the best decision <br/>\nwas to not have this neighbor boy over anymore and that it was best <br/>\nif all communication was cut off.    <br/>\n<br/>\nWell despite all of that my son has moments where he breaks down in <br/>\ntears and tell me that I don&#39;t like his &quot;friend&quot; and that is why he <br/>\ncan&#39;t play with him.  He has been telling me that he would like to go <br/>\nover his house again and start playing with him.  I know that I <br/>\nhelped make a decision but I absolutely did not do it alone. Perhaps <br/>\nI influenced him.  My maternal instincts were to just get him out of <br/>\nthat situation and keep him safe. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know what kind of environment I want to provide for my children.  I <br/>\nalso know that my son has a hole in his heart and I have yet to fill <br/>\nthat need for him.  I don&#39;t think that he really wants to be friends <br/>\nwith this boy, he often remembers what it was like when this boy <br/>\nwould come over.  I think he is craving that bond of friendship that <br/>\nhe thought he had. He is involved in Cubscouts once a week, soccer in <br/>\nSpring and Fall, church once a week.  Other than that we do not have <br/>\na lot of get togethers with other kids.  We live in a remote little <br/>\ntown and most of his friends go to school and can&#39;t play during the <br/>\nweek.  I was taking him to an artclass but that was way too formal to <br/>\nmake any lasting bonds.  I&#39;m thinking of helping him start a club--<br/>\nlegos or books (his loves)--here at home but not sure.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWas I wrong in the decision I though &quot;we&quot; made?  SHould he try it <br/>\nagain?  Or should I help him move on?  I&#39;m just not sure what I <br/>\nshould do.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40332,"nextTopicId":40256}}
