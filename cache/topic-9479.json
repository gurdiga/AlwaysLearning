There<br/>\nare a couple of other historical building there as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother beautiful place to see is the Empire Mine.  It has a small museum<br/>\nand you can see the owner&#39;s &quot;cottage&quot; and grounds which contains one of<br/>\nthe first indoor pools.  My mom says that when the mine was in operation<br/>\nit was so lound from the pounding of the hard rock ore that it could be<br/>\nheard all the way into Grass Valley.  I bought a book on my last visit<br/>\nthere which is a great history on the narrow gague railroad, Grass Valley<br/>\nand Nevada City.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this talk has me itching to get back there again, I could spend a<br/>\ncouple of weeks just wandering the area.<br/>\n<br/>\nKris<br/>\n\r<br/>\n________________________________________________________________\r<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!\r<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!\r<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
