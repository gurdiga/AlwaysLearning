So maybe it&#39;ll<br/>\nbe Sunday or Monday - that little change sure took the<br/>\nstress off.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids (Quentin 7 & Sierra 4) are all excited.  We<br/>\nbought them new luggage - they each have a small<br/>\nsuitcase with matching backpack.  I&#39;m not sure they<br/>\ncan fit ALL of their toys in them, but they are sure<br/>\ngoing to try.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ll leave Tucson and head for San Diego.  Then make<br/>\na stop at Legoland.  And then,...well, that is as far<br/>\nas we&#39;ve planned.  Our destination is actually<br/>\nSeattle, where we hope to find a place to rent for a<br/>\ncouple months.  We&#39;ve never been there so if any of<br/>\nyou have suggestions of areas to look, or recommended<br/>\nstops along the way, please share!  <br/>\n<br/>\nheather mclean<br/>\nHave laptop, will travel!<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
