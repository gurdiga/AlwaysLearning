We have a big-screen tv <br/>\nin our living room - and a small-screen tv in our bedroom. They got in the <br/>\nhabit of watching Voyager always in the bedroom -- I&#39;d go look at them all <br/>\npiled all over each other on our waterbed, cuddling and laughing and talking <br/>\nand giggling and making comments throughout the show. They&#39;d seen them all <br/>\nbefore -- and didn&#39;t mind missing some of it. It was VERY active viewing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt drove me nuts to watch it like that - although I LOVED seeing them doing <br/>\nit. So, if I really wanted to watch, instead of watching with them, I&#39;d go <br/>\nwatch in the living room or watch it later on my own.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce again this was a show with a LOT to offer -- lots of relationship stuff <br/>\n-- you should HEAR the kids talking out how one person behaved to another and <br/>\nwhat their motivation was and the likely reaction and so on... Also lots of <br/>\nscience interest was generated by it. Lots of wanting to know what was real <br/>\nand what was fiction.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd - even if I couldn&#39;t come up with one single redeeming tidbit of value - <br/>\nenjoyment is enough. Plus add to it that these three girls usually have <br/>\ninterests that are very different from each other&#39;s  and this was something <br/>\nthey did together and enjoyed together in their very own special way.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3187,"nextTopicId":3173}}
