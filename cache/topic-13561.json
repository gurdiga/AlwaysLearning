His <br/>\nmother didn&#39;t know what to do except hold him, and I had her apply pressure <br/>\nto the wound, and then someone whipped out the Rescue Remedy.  He was <br/>\nscreaming and crying and bleeding.  I sprayed it on his head and grabbed one <br/>\nof his wrists and gave him another squirt.  He didn&#39;t know what it was.  But <br/>\nhe literally stopped crying within 5 seconds!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI had been skeptical until that point.  All the people I&#39;d seen it used on <br/>\nwere capable of &quot;believing&quot; in it.

He did fine with the ideas of worm castings, <br/>\netc., but when it was time to put his worm in the bottle to take home to <br/>\nwatch it make tunnels, he couldn&#39;t do it.
