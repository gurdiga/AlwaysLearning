The water&#39;s not draining out and so it overflows and <br/>\neventually drips down into the inside of the car.  Sometimes when you go <br/>\naround a corner, you&#39;ll hear a &#39;sloshing&#39; sound or the &#39;drip&#39; will <br/>\nincrease.  That&#39;s a dead giveaway that it&#39;s blocked and <br/>\noverflowed.  Otherwise, it could be something else in the cooling/heating <br/>\nsystem and that&#39;s a whole lot more expensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can fix it yourself if you&#39;ve a mind to by finding the &#39;drip&#39; hose from <br/>\nthe AC unit (it&#39;s a hose about the width of your pinky finger that goes <br/>\nfrom the AC unit with the other end open, and the open-ended end usually <br/>\ndropping just below the motor (so the stuff can drain to the road.)  On my <br/>\ncar, it&#39;s pretty close to the windshield side of the engine compartment and <br/>\nabout a foot in from the side of the car and another foot and a half down <br/>\ninto the motor area.)  Now that you&#39;ve found the hose, unclip it so the <br/>\nopen ended part (usually pointing towards the ground under the motor) is <br/>\nwhere you can get ahold of it and attach something that can create some <br/>\nsuction.  (Only water and the offending bit of debris should be up the <br/>\nhose, so there&#39;s little reason you can&#39;t just use your mouth, or the mouth <br/>\nof your spouse! Just remember to spit afterwards! (and maybe brush your <br/>\nteeth)) (grin)  The suction will release whatever&#39;s gotten wedged up in the <br/>\nhose and you&#39;ll have a good quart or two of water coming out of the hose, <br/>\nmaybe more.  When the water&#39;s done draining, clip it back in and you&#39;re <br/>\ngood to go!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe lived it going across country.  Lake Volvo.  That was us until we <br/>\nfigured it out!  Cost us nothing to fix!
