Can you change something that will help them not be negatives. <br/>\nIf the house is too messy and it bothers your husband just do not say:&quot;Oh unschooling homes are like that.&quot; or say it is because the kids.

Maybe he doesn’t feel comfortable telling you his real feelings.  If you’ve felt surprised more than once that someone got a very different impression from him than what you were thinking, it’s possible the two of you aren’t communicating well.   That’s not the end of the world.  It might mean you have to listen more carefully, ask more direct questions, and take more action about things you know concern him. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a time David was more worried about Dylan.  To David it seemed all Dylan did was watch TV or play video games.  David wasn’t home very much to see the other stuff we did.  So I made a point, when he was away to tell he what we’d done that week.  And when he was home I made sure to be doing more.   I had been happy to stay home when David was home, to hang out with him and have a cozy nest, and so Dylan was watching more TV at those times.  David was thinking that’s how things were all the time for Dylan and it worried him.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSo consider whether your husband’s worries aren’t being addressed and do what you can to remedy that. If he’s heard more than once that “things aren’t up for discussion” with his mom or your parents then he likely thinks they’re not up for discussion with him, either. Saying, we’re happy and  you need to tell every one we’re happy, isn’t any kind of real communication.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI want to caution you about coercing your husband or kids to show some united front if it means glossing over your husband’s concerns or real issues with your kids.

Your family should not have to have any kind of scripted, “we’re all happy” dialog with grandma.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI sympathize because she sounds quite horrible.  I wouldn’t have a person like that in my home.  I’d let my husband go to her home with the kids if they wanted to see her or meet in some half way point, new city, and let my husband and kids visit while I did something else.   My first thought was that maybe she’s ill because her behavior seems so over the top.  But if she’s getting the idea you’re trying to hide family dysfunction then she might be so worried she’s not behaving well.  Still, I second Sandra’s recommendation for this visit.  Get out of the house, stay on neutral ground as much as possible.  Let your husband be with her most of the time.   <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":459518685,"authorName":"Jenna Brotherton","from":"Jenna Brotherton &lt;jenna.brotherton@...&gt;","profile":"unschooling_nt","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Mother-In-Law Issues","postDate":"1327018274","msgId":65123,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ2QjdFRDIwLTA4NUQtNDRGNC04Q0E3LTkyMDc1MEFGNDM1Q0BnbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PEYzNTMwMDBFLTEwQjEtNENGQi1CNzY0LTczMDc0QzU4QjAwN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGpmYTlsNisydmk1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8RjM1MzAwMEUtMTBCMS00Q0ZCLUI3NjQtNzMwNzRDNThCMDA3QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65122,"nextInTopic":65124,"prevInTime":65122,"nextInTime":65124,"topicId":65121,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Sandra, I m not having massive issues with my MIL but occasionally things do come up in relation to our chosen way of parenting.

A bit of background.  My mother-in-law and I have a very strained relationship and we didn&#39;t speak for a couple of years after I confronted her, firmly but respectfully, about how she was treating my then 8 year old daughter (she was being very emotionally manipulative).  She lives overseas and after I confronted her she literally packed her bags and flew back home rather than discuss the issue.  There were then several nasty phonecalls from her other family members telling me what a bitch I was, which led to my husband and his brother no longer speaking. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids had no contact with her other than the occassional Skype call during the last 2 years, but that changed when my daughter asked to spend time with her.  She said she felt more ready to handle her and take the good with the bad.  Of course, I then initiated contact with her and we agreed to put the past behind us for the kids sake. We are both very watchful of how she is with the kids and alert to anything she may say that may hurt them. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe first visit she had after this was for a week three months ago.  It was good for the kids but a disaster for me.  On the surface everything seemed ok, but she was a raging bitch to me in a very snidey way.  My daughter noticed it too which was sad.  Comments about my parenting, my weight, my looks, unfavourable comparisons to my sister-in-law etc.  Lots of underhand put-downs.  All this I could take but at the end of the week when she cornered me on my own she started to cry and say how sad she was to be leaving my husband in this &#39;awful situation&#39;.  I was aghast, but she went on to tell me how unhappy he was, how stressed, and how she wished she could be here to help her poor, poor son. I said he was very happy but we were having a few issues, as all families do, but she just continued to cry and shake her head.  She also stayed up late with my daughter one night and she talked to her about how awful her life must be in this family etc etc, but my daughter said she told her straight she was very happy.  She wasn&#39;t upset and seems old enough to handle her granny&#39;s nonsense. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I discussed this with my husband he was shocked and said he had only told her about our usual day-to-day stuff. Apparently he doesn&#39;t tell her he is happy and committed to this way of life (even though he believes that), because he assumed it was &#39;a given&#39;, and that it isn&#39;t up for discussion.  I asked him to make sure she knew this, for the benefit of everyone for the next visit, and I assumed he had done that (he speaks to her every week). <br/>\n<br/>\nFast forward to now, and she is due to arrive on Monday.  We have just had a rental inspection, which meant the last week was pretty stressful trying to get the house up together.  Also, our son has been having some issues with the neighbours children and we have been worrying about that.  I overhead him talking to her on Skype about this in a very negative way, and she started banging on about how she was going to have a serious chat with us when she gets here, and how we should put the kids into school, and our two youngest into childcare, and Jack into private therapy and she is going to pay for it all, and how she can&#39;t &#39;bear to see him like this&#39;, and how she is going to fix it all and save him blah blah!  He just kind of ummed and nodded and then they signed off.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was so hurt, and have been ever since.  I confronted him and asked him how he truly feels and, as I already knew, he is committed to unschooling but still has some issues with the parenting side of things - I think it is transitional but that&#39;s another post! I explained to him that I thought he had agreed to make sure she knew we were happy, committed and it wasn&#39;t up for discussion - at least not with me! He said he would sort it on the drive home from the airport.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe did a similar thing with my parents the last time they visited discussing all the things that were &#39;wrong&#39; with our lives, and they to got the impression that it was ok to make comments on our lifestyle.  I had to firmly let them know that it wasn&#39;t up for discussion and I was very happy.  I communicated with him then how disappointed I was that he put me in that position because it did cause a strain on me and my parents for a while.  Now he is doing it again with his mother for the second time.  He is a very negative person by nature - always sees the worst - and I think that he doesn&#39;t realise that people don&#39;t automatically know that overall he is happy unless he tells them. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the moment I am so upset and can barely look at him.  Of course, me feeling like this is going to make next week even harder to show a united front. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do I do now?  How do I move on from this feeling? Being firm with her and saying, &#39;We are just fine thankyou&#39; will not work with her and I am so scared there is going to be a blow-up like there was 2 years ago. <br/>\nThanks for reading this far!<br/>\nChay.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65111,"nextTopicId":65128}}
