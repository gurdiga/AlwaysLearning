He&#39;d had a sleep over the night before and <br/>\nwas pretty tired, and I could sense that he was getting touchy and <br/>\ngrumpy with his friends and needed some input, some mothering, some <br/>\nSOMEthing.<br/>\nWhen he came inside I had a quick talk with him about thinking <br/>\nbefore speaking or acting, and then I was overcome with this urge to <br/>\nhold him.  So I said &quot;do you need a hug?&quot; and pulled him on my lap <br/>\nin a sort of goofy/giggly way and rocked him and started to sing to <br/>\nhim a favorite lullaby song from when he was a toddler.  I was <br/>\npretending he was still my baby in a goofy sort of way.  He got all <br/>\nsmiley and happy and pretended to struggle, and then when he finally <br/>\ngot away to go back outside he had a huge grin on his face just like <br/>\na rainbow came out, and he was better with his friends after that.<br/>\nI&#39;ve been thinking about it... it&#39;s almost like he&#39;s torn between a <br/>\npart of him pulling away and a part of him needing that physical <br/>\nnurturing, and I&#39;ve realized that pretending that I&#39;m kidding with <br/>\nhim allows him that &quot;babying&quot; and at the same time lets him see <br/>\nhimself as &quot;too old&quot; for that.  (Since I&#39;m pretending to be the <br/>\nneedy Mom and he&#39;s pretending to struggle).  It&#39;s difficult to put <br/>\ninto words, but I think it&#39;s my close connection with him that <br/>\nallows me to perceive the non-verbal stuff so well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as that cat/dog thing being either funny or sadly reflective <br/>\nof society... I think some jokes can be both.<br/>\nDoes anyone remember the commercial a few years ago- I think it was <br/>\nfor Staples or a store like it- about back to school supplies?  It <br/>\naired at the end of the summer, and consisted of the song &quot;It&#39;s the <br/>\nmost wonderful time of the year...&quot; (a part of the Christmas song) <br/>\nand the Dad was all happy and jauntily tossing school supplies into <br/>\nthe shopping cart while the kids pouted behind him.  While one part <br/>\nof me thought it was a very, very sad reflection (I don&#39;t need to <br/>\nexplain to any of you why), at the same time I could see why the <br/>\naverage Joe would find it amusing.<br/>\n<br/>\nPatti</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150527288,"authorName":"Ren","from":"Ren &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"for  your critique","postDate":"1070122304","msgId":17456,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMxMTI5LjA4MTI0MC4zNTc5LjEwMDE0NDZAd2VibWFpbDEwLm55Yy51bnRkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":17465,"prevInTime":17455,"nextInTime":17457,"topicId":17456,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The dog and cat thing was QUITE mild compared to other things I ve seen.
