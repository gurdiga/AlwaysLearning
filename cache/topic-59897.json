It&#39;s not <br/>\nan ideal one, and he might even recognize that IF he had something to compare it <br/>\nto.  Can he find other friends with less to deal with?  There is a fine line in <br/>\nwhich to follow on how much of dysfunctional others one allows into their lives. <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHow has he been thus far in picking friends?  Does he generally pick decent <br/>\nones?  Does he have good people instincts?  How often does he get to use his <br/>\npeople skills?  How often does he have social outlets to pick and choose from?<br/>\n<br/>\nFreedom to run around is soooo important to some kids, especially when they are <br/>\nin the early teens!  Find a way to help that happen without having to do that in <br/>\na bad neighborhood with not very nice kids.  One of the best adventure starters <br/>\nfor my daughter was late night concerts.  She could go with friends, get there <br/>\non her own, be IN a location, stay for many hours, stay out late, get a little <br/>\nadventure afterwards on the way home, and have fun with music.  Sometimes the <br/>\nlocation of the venues were downtown or across town, so it felt like she was in <br/>\nthe middle of the city action.  It was hugely important!<br/>\n<br/>\n***I have stopped going to her house with my children to play. My second<br/>\nson, Sunny 8 asked not to play at their house again.***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf one of your children has asked you not to play over there, then you shouldn&#39;t <br/>\ndo so.  Do NOT go over there if one of your kids is uncomfortable!  That should <br/>\nbe your compass.  YOU are already expressing discomfort and one of your kids <br/>\nare, so that&#39;s enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I would also like to add that I find it really hard to have the boy who my<br/>\nolder son likes around since all he speaks of is violence and stuff that<br/>\npushes my buttons. I see however, that I am the adult and he is the child<br/>\nand at my house at least speaking about these things is perhaps something<br/>\nthat I could learn to deal with in a productive/calm/supportive/ (?) way.***<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could be the person who shows him that it isn&#39;t normal or acceptable <br/>\nbehavior by not allowing it in your home.  You can tell him to keep it in <br/>\nanother room and away from you and the younger kids.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***I would love to be, and am working<br/>\ntoward being, the one whose house the friends of my children choose to come<br/>\nto and frankly at the moment that is not going to happen unless I chill out<br/>\na bit (lot).***<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s my house.  The reason it is that way is because our house is happy and <br/>\npeaceful, even when it&#39;s loud and wild with lots of people.  You don&#39;t have to <br/>\nallow anybody into your home, you don&#39;t have to allow any behavior in your home. <br/>\n For me, if behavior of others disrupts the happy peace of my home, I don&#39;t want <br/>\nit here.  I can&#39;t have it here.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBeing able to be calm and peaceful helps.  I did figure out that I needed to be <br/>\nthat way in order to be the kind of place that people come to because it is calm <br/>\nand peaceful.  There are lots of teens that come here and call it home because <br/>\ntheir own homes aren&#39;t that great.  Kids will rise to the behavior that&#39;s set <br/>\nbefore them.  One of the biggest factors for behavior, is how people treat the <br/>\nyoungest child in the house.  It&#39;s completely non negotiable.  If someone comes <br/>\nhere and routinely treats our youngest child poorly, then they don&#39;t get asked <br/>\nback after a few trials.<br/>\n<br/>\n ***I want to support my friend and yet...........I am not sure....***<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can support her in other ways.

Support as in &quot;there there, <br/>\nit&#39;s going to be all right...you are a wonderful person&quot; is not helpful. <br/>\n Support is sometimes saying, &quot;you are my friend, but you can&#39;t do that.&quot; <br/>\n Support is encouraging her get her connected to resources that can help her <br/>\nmanage her anger and her circumstances.<br/>\n<br/>\nSteph L.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":395445203,"authorName":"Ellie","from":"&quot;Ellie&quot; &lt;elliep@...&gt;","profile":"elliep@xtra.co.nz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"support for a friend / staying safe.","postDate":"1298195741","msgId":59897,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTcwMWNiZDBlNCQ1NWU1ZGU0MCQwMWIxOWFjMCRAY28ubno+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":59900,"prevInTime":59896,"nextInTime":59898,"topicId":59897,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I am new to this forum.

I have been reading for about or 4 months and am<br/>\nboth encouraged and challenged.  And happy to have found such thoughtful<br/>\ndiscussions.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI have just listened to Sandra&#39;s and Richard Prystowsky &#39;Peaceful Parenting&#39;<br/>\naudio which was wonderful.  My husband and MIL were listening too...:)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is also a little serendipitous because I have this ongoing conflict that<br/>\nI would like some other opinions on concerning peaceful parenting and &#39;being<br/>\nsafe&#39; as discussed in by Sandra in the Audio. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a good friend who is an extremely troubled, marriage.  Things are<br/>\nmoving toward a climax of some sort (my friend is in the process of working<br/>\nout how to extricate herself) and the threat of escalated violence toward my<br/>\nfriend by the husband has increased. He has in the past been violent and<br/>\nrecently threatened to be so again, in front of the children.  The children<br/>\nhave also been subjected by my friend to violent acts like smacking and<br/>\nother acts of uncontrolled anger as the result of stress on the part of my<br/>\nfriend.  The father also smacks as a result of anger but is absent a lot of<br/>\nthe time.    <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThey also live in the roughest area of our city and the children are exposed<br/>\nto violence on the streets too.  The neighbourhood children and my friend&#39;s<br/>\nchildren run around and on the occasions when my children and I were there I<br/>\nhad to work really hard to ensure that I knew where they were and what was<br/>\ngoing on; in as much as if I let them go play with my friend&#39;s children it<br/>\nmeant going around the neighbourhood and perhaps even to other people&#39;s<br/>\nhouses.....people my friend knows but whom I do not.  My friend is a<br/>\nwonderful person in a rotten situation.   Her children are 14, 12, 8 and 5.<br/>\nThe first 3 are boys and the eldest one verbally abuses his mother regularly<br/>\nand has started to do so physically.  The second has started to verbally<br/>\nabuse his mother too.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  I have stopped going to her house with my children to play.  My second<br/>\nson, Sunny 8 asked not to play at their house again.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is something about what happens over at their house however;  the boys<br/>\nget to run about the streets (we live in the country), perhaps the tension<br/>\nand the one-upmanship, the regular use of bad language by the young boys<br/>\netc....it is extremely difficult to describe why my son would find this<br/>\nattractive, suffice perhaps at the moment to state that he has always<br/>\nenjoyed &#39;power&#39;....being powerful, and perhaps this is the kernel which I<br/>\nshould investigate....however, I am not sure whether this is relevant to the<br/>\nquestion at this point...and perhaps I have it wrong..........the question<br/>\nis quite simply, should I allow my son to hang out with these boys?  Here or<br/>\nThere?  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI would also like to add that I find it really hard to have the boy who my<br/>\nolder son likes around since all he speaks of is violence and stuff that<br/>\npushes my buttons.  I see however, that I am the adult and he is the child<br/>\nand at my house at least speaking about these things is perhaps something<br/>\nthat I could learn to deal with in a productive/calm/supportive/ (?) way. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to do the best I can by my friend (who really needs all the<br/>\nsupport she can get) and by her son.  I would love to be, and am working<br/>\ntoward being, the one whose house the friends of my children choose to come<br/>\nto and frankly at the moment that is not going to happen unless I chill out<br/>\na bit (lot).  <br/>\n<br/>\nPlus, I find my son&#39;s behaviour and attitude really difficult to deal with<br/>\nafter one of these visits from his friend.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI am confused, since I am not sure if this is a place to begin the work on<br/>\nmyself that I know needs doing regarding being cool around ALL children, not<br/>\njust my own and more importantly my friend could do with the support; she<br/>\nhas today asked me to have the two younger boys to stay at the end of this<br/>\nweek.  This wouldn&#39;t be quite so bad but my husband, whom I have asked to be<br/>\naround when they visited for the last few months or so, is working away.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI feel really confused.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI want to support my friend and yet...........I am not sure....<br/>\n<br/>\nI am also asking myself what my actions say to my eldest son?  How do I<br/>\nallow his choices and keep him safe in this situation?    <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, my younger son and my older son ALWAYS argue in a way that they<br/>\nnever do when my friend&#39;s boys aren&#39;t here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have a two year old baby.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts, questions or ideas would be very much appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards<br/>\n<br/>\nEllie Walker.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59680,"nextTopicId":59955}}
