The holder they have for them has two slots for each state, one <br/>\nfor Denver minted coins and one for Philadelphia minted coins.  Thing <br/>\nis that Philadelphia minted coins are pretty scarce out here on the <br/>\nwest coast.  The first couple of years we traded with a friend who <br/>\nlived back east, but they moved back to California.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...I was wondering if some other east coast family would be <br/>\ninterested in trading us some Philly minted state quarters for some <br/>\nDenver ones.  We recently had lots of coins come into our lives so we <br/>\nhave a pretty complete set of Denver ones.  Email me off list if <br/>\nyou&#39;re interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29079,"nextTopicId":29001}}
