In some ways I saw it as him rejecting some of<br/>\nthe attempts to make him a guru and unschooling a cult.  I was also<br/>\nfascinated watching him change both in his books and perhaps moreso in the<br/>\npages of Growing Without Schooling. I think it is important to remember that<br/>\neven though Holt tried hard not to lean on his privileged &quot;credentials&quot;,  it<br/>\nwas impossible for his philosophy not to have been influenced by same.<br/>\nJust as there is not a complete substitute for everyday parental experience<br/>\nin learning about children.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you get the first two books, &quot;How Children Fail&quot; and &quot;How Children<br/>\n&gt; Learn,&quot; get the revised editions. Holt comments some on his own ideas and<br/>\n&gt; notes where he has changed his opinion. Those are very interesting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I always preferred How Children Fail to How Children Learn (I read both in<br/>\nhigh school in the 60s along with Herndon and Kozol).<br/>\nI still disagree with some of the observations and Piaget interpretations in<br/>\nHow Children Learn but find How Children Fail to be &quot;spot on&quot;  with<br/>\n&quot;scripts&quot; children and teachers utilize.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If<br/>\n&gt; you buy &quot;Teach Your Own&quot; get the 1981 edition and skip the revised version<br/>\n&gt; that was updated by Pat Farenga.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I got a first edition of Teach Your own but it didn&#39;t fully resonate with<br/>\nme.

His ideas that &quot;properly schooled&quot;<br/>\ndoes not at all equate &quot;well educated&quot;  or especially &quot;intelligent&quot;  are<br/>\nstill fresh and relevant.
