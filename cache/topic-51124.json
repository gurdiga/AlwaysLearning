Actually it is paint with metal particles in it to make magnet sticks to the wall.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if I could get some ideas of how to make use of the magnets.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestion?<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore this wall, I had nothing in the house I can put magnets on, so I haven&#39;t looked around magnets.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to hear your cool ideas!<br/>\n<br/>\nJoy (DS4.25 DD1.25)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":51044,"nextTopicId":51159}}
