He did a cave drawing and made some homemade clay that he played with for over an hour one morning.  He spent time in the greenhouse with his dad, cleaning hydroponic channels and transferring nursery plants.  He seemed piqued by the idea of changing the &quot;school&quot; room into a play-room / science lab / plant propagation room.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, here&#39;s my question:<br/>\nJulian is, as I was for my entire childhood, addicted to feedback.  There are few things he does without asking, &quot;Is it good?  Did I do good?&quot;<br/>\nFrom &quot;school work&quot; to working with his dad to eating to playing, he wants a rating.  &quot;On a scale of 1-10, what do you give it?&quot; he wants to know.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have struggled with this for years.  Before I found unschooling, I already felt uncomfortable &quot;grading&quot; his work, because I know how addicting and unnecessary that whole system became for me, through college and beyond.  But it&#39;s all he knows.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral months back, when I started doing more of his schooling with him, and he wanted my feedback on some work he&#39;d done, I&#39;d throw it back to him -- &quot;what do YOU think?  Did you do your best?&quot; etc.  However, I also felt that was a difficult way of helping him to feel capable and independent -- he seemed to feel that I was tricking him -- after all, if an adult doesn&#39;t say, &quot;You did a good job,&quot; then there must be a problem, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the further we get from him doing formal &quot;school&quot; projects and activities, the less he&#39;ll ask.  But for now, he wants an answer, and I am seriously at a loss as to how to respond in a way that both affirms what he&#39;s up to, and also helps him start to develop some trust in his own ability to do stuff.  This kid wants affirmation on how he eats, and how he plays with Legos -- &quot;Did I do a good job?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI so want to help guide him away from being a people-pleaser.  He&#39;s such a sweet-heart, but he can&#39;t get past wanting everyone to like him and be happy with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo much of this has been trained into him over the years -- Gram has to judge every single act he does as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad,&quot; whether he&#39;s combing his hair or playing in a pile of leaves.
