This is my home &quot;town&quot; - (Southern California) <br/>\nand I really love it here.  What you choose to do is going to depend a <br/>\nlot on your family&#39;s interests. There are the obvious places - Sea <br/>\nWorld, San Diego Zoo, Wild Animal Park, Legoland, beaches galore! <br/>\nWeather at that time of year is almost always very sunny and warm -- <br/>\ntypical temperature range for september is about 67 to 78 degrees (low <br/>\nto high). Warmer inland - so the Wild Animal Park, for example, would <br/>\nlikely be up into the 80&#39;s or even the 90&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn San Diego - with kids:<br/>\n<br/>\nBeaches -  there are so many gorgeous beaches - you can have a bonfire <br/>\nin the evening, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBalboa Park is absolutely gorgeous - there are a bunch of different <br/>\ngardens to go walk through that are all free and there is a large <br/>\ncluster of great museums - I think there are actually about 15 museums. <br/>\nThe science museum &quot;Fleet Museum&quot; has an astronomy group that sets up <br/>\ntelescopes on the first Wednesday night of each month (which would be <br/>\nthe week before the conference, if you&#39;re there that early). Some of the <br/>\nmuseums have some free days on Tuesdays. There are free organ concerts <br/>\nin Balboa Park on Sundays. The whole park is beautiful.<br/>\n<br/>\nTijuana, Mexico, is great for a quick half-day visit to a foreign <br/>\ncountry - it is maybe 40 minutes or so from the conference location. You <br/>\ncan take a Gray Line tour or just go on your own and walk around looking <br/>\nin shops, etc. You DO need some ID - if you don&#39;t have a passport you <br/>\nneed a US or Canadian drivers license plus either a birth certificate or <br/>\ngreen card (there are lots of other options). Kids need a birth <br/>\ncertificate.<br/>\n<br/>\nLegoland has homeschool days  on Mondays - it is a HUGE discount. <br/>\nRegular price is $63/$53 (adults/kids) and we get in for $17 on <br/>\nhomeschool Mondays. You have to ask for the discount more than two weeks <br/>\nahead of time - you do it online and one week before your date you can <br/>\ndownload your coupon that is good for up to 6 people.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a lot more right there in san diego - but you might also want <br/>\nto go up the coast a little to see other beaches or go out to the desert <br/>\n(google Anza Borrego) to see a little of that or up to Los <br/>\nAngeles/Hollywood (I really really like Universal Studios a lot) and, of <br/>\ncourse Disneyland is only an hour and a half away.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is truly no better place in the world for a family vacation - I <br/>\nLIVE here and I can&#39;t get enough of it.
