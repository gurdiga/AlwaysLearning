Until then we just<br/>\nenjoyed what we could and a couple of children chose some strong<br/>\ndirections.  Mike did become a Master at chess----Caty did become an<br/>\noptional gymnast.  But Mike�s sport got cheaper as he go better and<br/>\nCaty�s go more expensive.  We had to pull 3 of the other children out of<br/>\ntheir activities also---they haven�t had the chance to get that good.<br/>\nWe do not qualify for any credit----we are basically extended because of<br/>\nour medical bills right now.   I can�t fix our finances----I told the<br/>\nchildren that we have to live within our financial means.  And this<br/>\nchanges constantly.   We had been flush for about 3 yrs. and the<br/>\nchildren had more choices----(not jobs of course----but activities)<br/>\nNow, we can�t afford these things and we had to leave all our<br/>\nactivities----Caty paid the highest price, Mike wasn�t as affected<br/>\nbecause his sport earned him money and scholarships.  <br/>\nI still believe you may be correct on the fact that she is going because<br/>\nshe now has a choice and did not have this choice before----but it never<br/>\neven occurred to us that one of the children would want to go to school.<br/>\nBut I don�t want to deny her other opportunities that she thinks the<br/>\nschools will provide her.   <br/>\nI am still sick over it---and your correct in some respects she no<br/>\nlonger has certain choices anymore.   She can choose to get a volunteer<br/>\njob now----but she doesn�t want to do that.   Her choices are limited to<br/>\nwhat we can afford.  This yr.  Mike has decide to go to college�he has a<br/>\nscholarship, and Kevin is working, and Rio is staying home---taking some<br/>\nonline college courses with her small earnings----babysitting.  Caty<br/>\nwants to be at school.  <br/>\n I feel the negativity because I feel like I failed her or made home so<br/>\nmiserable that she would prefer to be away 6 hrs a day at gym----or now<br/>\nat a school.   The older children feel like she is going to change our<br/>\nway of life with school-----but it is changing constantly now with the<br/>\nolder children setting out on their own.  <br/>\nWe probably do have more  many more rules and timings here----part of it<br/>\nis due to the children out numbering us  and myself becoming to<br/>\nexhausted trying to keep up with 7 children.  My timings are due to what<br/>\nis legal and acceptable to both Steve and I -----they can�t stay home<br/>\nalone till 11----they can�t baby sit till 13,  they can�t stay up all<br/>\nnight till 13----the older children set this one----due to the fact they<br/>\ndon�t want to assist or be responsible for their younger brothers and<br/>\nsisters----and because they get so cranky.   So yes we do have timings<br/>\nhere----age passages.

Sandra I am writing you a bit out of desperation<br/>\nagain---but this time it is not with Mike----he is doing good for his<br/>\nproblems.  Let me bore you with a run down of this year----so you could<br/>\nunderstand this problem.  In  October Rio ( 3rd girl ---15) ended up in<br/>\nPediatric ICU for a week she had severe asthma----she was attending 2<br/>\ncourses at UNLV----because she wanted to---I thought it was too early<br/>\nbut you know how Steve can be----so I allowed she took English and<br/>\nBiology.  After the hospital I withdrew her from her classes because<br/>\nthere was no way for her to make up the work she missed 2 and half weeks<br/>\nof college---and was to drugged up to even try to study on her own.<br/>\nShe went back in the spring only taking Biology in case something else<br/>\nhappened---which did ----she broke her right hand.  But she finished and<br/>\npassed Biology all on her own.  I did go in an ask her if she prepared<br/>\nfor her test or anything---because this is what she chose to do.  Mike (<br/>\nthe oldest)  was discovered in December with a tumor in is sinuses.  <br/>\nHe chose not to go to college the spring semester---he had terrible<br/>\nheadaches and the steroid they put him on cause problems with anger and<br/>\nthe ability for him to focus ---he noticed this with his chess game<br/>\nsliding a bit.  So he did nothing but take care of himself and deal with<br/>\nthis horrible disease----it is and allergic reaction to fungus---causing<br/>\na tumor in the sinus that moved both his nose and eye ---he became<br/>\nslightly deformed as the tumor grew ---until they could get him into<br/>\nsurgery---had to have a 3 specialist there---two being neurologist and<br/>\none an ear nose throat surgeon----so it took 3 months to get this<br/>\nsurgery.  No brain compromise which was good.  But he still has drug<br/>\nissues because this will be with him the rest of his life.  We are<br/>\ndealing with insurance issues because he turns 18 in one month and he<br/>\ncan�t be uninsured---his drugs run over a 100 a month with<br/>\ninsurance----minor problem for me now---just money.  Kevin ( 2nd child<br/>\n16) is doing good has a job---just as he wanted---likes working.  But my<br/>\nproblem now is Caty (4th child 14) She wants to go to public school.<br/>\nShe is a level 8 gymnast---but was pulled out of gym in January because<br/>\nof all the hospital and drug expenses for Mike and Rio----we couldn�t<br/>\nafford it.  She is angry with us---or upset.  I don�t know if I am being<br/>\nto harsh.  But she now says she feels like we are locking her away from<br/>\nfriends and she has no social life anymore because we can�t afford to<br/>\nsend her to gym.  So she wants to go to school and to make friends.  Our<br/>\nunschooling group does not have very many teens in it.  We haven�t found<br/>\nvery many unschool teenagers here.  The ones we know ---have to be part<br/>\nof a class or structured event  to attend.  They are too busy to just<br/>\nhang out and do what they want.  Understand my older 3 think Caty is<br/>\njust throwing a tantrum because she isn�t the center of daddy�s world<br/>\nbeing the best gymnast.  And to get dad�s attention she wants to go to<br/>\npublic school----she got dad�s attention---he wants her in all honors<br/>\nclasses.  Sandra----I unschool---she is not unlearned---she is a bright<br/>\nchild ---but she is not Mike or Rio either---she doesn�t pick up<br/>\nDiscover magazine and discuss the string theory and waves vs. particles,<br/>\nnor does she follow Rio and devour every book she can.  She doesn�t even<br/>\ndo the math Rio and Mike will sit down and do just because they want to<br/>\nknow it.  Caty can read----she is meddling through the Leminy Snicket<br/>\nseries.  She is doing math right now because the older kids have taunted<br/>\nher a bit. They are not pleased she wants to go to public school and<br/>\nbring negative attention to us.  They don�t think she will like it.<br/>\nKevin says that Caty thinks public school is going to be like �That�s so<br/>\nRaven�.  And they don�t want her going then dropping out in 4 wks.  I<br/>\ntold her if she didn�t like it she could quit before her first grades<br/>\ncame out;  but dad and the children said --- then don�t send her because<br/>\nif she quits it will look bad for everyone in the family.  We are a bit<br/>\npublic because of the politics I have been involved in.  So I can<br/>\nunderstand where the older 3 are coming from.  Kevin also doesn�t study<br/>\nor read like Mike and Rio; and Kevin says that Caty won�t like the<br/>\nwork----since she doesn�t like to do now---she isn�t going to like any<br/>\nmore from school.  I have been making myself sick over this dilemma.  I<br/>\ndon�t want her to go to school.  But I wanted my children to be able to<br/>\nchoose a direction when they reach 14.  That is why I supported Rio in<br/>\ncollege----it wasn�t a heavy load and she did it on her own.  I<br/>\nsupported Kevin when he wanted to wait to go to work----he had no<br/>\ndirection until then-----but he knew what he wanted---and he couldn�t<br/>\nbegin until he was 16.  So that was his choice.  So I feel like I am not<br/>\nsupporting Caty if I don�t let her go to school; and I supported all the<br/>\nolder 3 children�s decisions. <br/>\nThe sad part is I am being scrutinized by family and well meaning<br/>\nfriends.  They think it is great Caty wants to go to school<br/>\n---especially some of the family and they specifically don�t think she<br/>\nwill succeed because they think what I am doing is wrong.  They say Caty<br/>\nis too lazy----I argue she is not interested in Mike and Rio and there<br/>\nare other things in life besides what is in books.  They say that Caty<br/>\ngoing to school will prove that my unschooling is not working----- I<br/>\ndon�t unschool to prepare my children for school ---I am trying to<br/>\nprepare them for life. I am so stressed and the older children hear this<br/>\nand it makes them angry.  The older children don�t want Caty to be<br/>\nallowed to go to school----they blame all the responses are negative and<br/>\nare cause by Caty�s tantrum of wanting to go to school.  <br/>\nAsk me some questions for clarification---but I am sending to the entire<br/>\ngroup ---in case anyone has tried this and has some insight.  But I am<br/>\naddressing you because you know me ---and watch our strange unschooling<br/>\npractices and everything you suggested with Mike worked----go back to<br/>\nwhat works.   <br/>\nYour advice always has ----<br/>\nSteve doesn�t want her in school either but feels pushed and thus<br/>\ninsists if she goes he will decide what she can and cant� do---including<br/>\nhonors courses. If she is compelled to go to school then she should<br/>\nstudy something.  This is not a park day, and we will be watched. When<br/>\nyou open the doors people look in.   <br/>\nThanks for your time and patience again. <br/>\nKime<br/>\n    <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nNo virus found in this incoming message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>\nVersion: 7.0.338 / Virus Database: 267.9.7/60 - Release Date: 7/28/2005<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>\nVersion: 7.0.338 / Virus Database: 267.9.7/60 - Release Date: 7/28/2005<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":230706843,"authorName":"Betsy Hill","from":"Betsy Hill &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] failure","postDate":"1122565524","msgId":22862,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQyRThGRDk0LjIwMjAzMDNAc2JjZ2xvYmFsLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDNzYwQ0E3QTEyRDQxMS1FMzAtMkFCRUBNQkxLLU0zOC5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDUwNzI1MTY0MzE4Ljc0MDcxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjMzMjA5Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDhDNzYwQ0E3QTEyRDQxMS1FMzAtMkFCRUBNQkxLLU0zOC5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":22860,"nextInTopic":22864,"prevInTime":22861,"nextInTime":22863,"topicId":22795,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"** So when I gave up and chose another plant---that wasn t a deferred success ** Kelly, I would disagree.

Does that change how those kids <br/>\nfeel or are treated?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat used to be &quot;wild and distracted&quot; or &quot;hyperactive&quot; is now &quot;ADD&quot; <br/>\n---how does that make the child feel? Better?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat used to be &quot;difficult&quot; or &quot;strong-willed&quot; is now &quot;Oppositional <br/>\nDefiant Disorder&quot; or &quot;ODD&quot;---how THAT for an acronym??<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a child wasn&#39;t up to par with his classmates, he was considered <br/>\n&quot;slow&quot;---does having &quot;Learning Differences&quot; make it all better? None of <br/>\nus learn the *same*, but *HE* has &quot;learning differences.&quot;  They have <br/>\nentire schools dedicated now to those with learning differences.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the idea of failing in schools is an absolute AWFUL one.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad no one told me how I&#39;d failed when starting my garden. It&#39;s <br/>\ntaken years of trying and trying and having successes and failures to <br/>\nfigure out what works where or not at all. I could TELL that I&#39;d failed <br/>\nhaving a plant *here* instead of *there*. I fixed it---or got a <br/>\ndifferent plant. So when I gave up and chose another plant---that <br/>\nwasn&#39;t a &quot;deferred success&quot;---that was failure and I knew it wasn&#39;t the <br/>\nplant for me. Time to find a more compatible plant for the garden. I <br/>\nguess I *could* have kept trying to make that plant &quot;fit&quot; in direct sun <br/>\nby watering it more and standing over it with an umbrella: I chose to <br/>\ntoss it out and find a better plant! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a billboard here in town with a photo of Edison and a <br/>\nlightbulb---it says something like, &quot;On the 1,000,000th try, success!&quot; <br/>\nBut he assumed that he would succeed and that there would not be <br/>\nfailure, but deferred success. He wanted that light bulb to work!<br/>\n<br/>\n*I* think it&#39;s sometimes better to fail and be done with it. Those <br/>\nschool kids will *still* have to achieve success in order to not fail.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with Joyce: sounds like something Orwell could have written.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&quot;Learning should be life-long and it should be something that everybody <br/>\nknows<br/>\nthey can do and knows they can have a bash at.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We&#39;re not helping it. They are still talking pass and fail and it&#39;s a <br/>\nvery<br/>\ndepressing thing to deal with.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMrs Beattie, who lives in Ipswich, continued: &quot;I&#39;d rather tell kids <br/>\nthat they<br/>\nhave done jolly well, they worked really well, they have achieved that <br/>\nand<br/>\nthat&#39;s brilliant.&quot;<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI think she&#39;s right here. I think learning IS life-long. I think you <br/>\nshould tell kids that they&#39;ve done jolly well. I think schools AREN&#39;T <br/>\nhelping and that they ARE depressing! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in *real life* failure is a normal thing. It&#39;s like she&#39;s trying to <br/>\nnever have these kids think that failure is OK. It&#39;s just a step. A <br/>\nlearning-take.<br/>\n<br/>\nFailure is not always such a bad thing---not in the real world. Just in <br/>\nschools.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: failure","postDate":"1122471186","msgId":22806,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFjMS4yZDI3YmE3NS4zMDE4ZTcxMkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":22805,"nextInTopic":22807,"prevInTime":22805,"nextInTime":22807,"topicId":22795,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Except she hasn&#39;t gone far enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchools are set up as assembly lines. Kids have to succeed at <br/>\none thing before they can move onto the next.<br/>\n<br/>\nA teacher can allow a child to &quot;defer success&quot; on some things.  <br/>\nFor instance, a child doesn&#39;t need to know how to write an &quot;A&quot; to <br/>\nwrite a &quot;B&quot;. But at some point the curriculum is based on <br/>\nunderstanding what was explained before. *In school* a child <br/>\ncan&#39;t &quot;defer success&quot; in reading until they&#39;re 11. For one thing, a <br/>\nschool can&#39;t erase the child&#39;s understanding that they can&#39;t do <br/>\nwhat (feels like) everyone else can. For another thing, the <br/>\ncurriculum requires that children be reading independly by 4th <br/>\ngrade. If they aren&#39;t, they need &quot;special help&quot; (e.g., help that&#39;s <br/>\nreserved for the dumb kids.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe system is set up to run on success and correcting failure. <br/>\nThat system can&#39;t be erased by replacing the word failure with <br/>\nthe phrase &quot;defered success&quot;.

Eventually, if you experience enough of it, it stops you in your tracks.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Education is too important for that - we need to keep people striving on. I&#39;ve always thought that, educationally, it was a good thing to get rid of total pass or total fail.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Learning should be life-long and it should be something that everybody knows they can do and knows they can have a bash at.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We&#39;re not helping it. They are still talking pass and fail and it&#39;s a very depressing thing to deal with.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMrs Beattie, who lives in Ipswich, continued: &quot;I&#39;d rather tell kids that they have done jolly well, they worked really well, they have achieved that and that&#39;s brilliant.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You can then say tomorrow we should try that - rather than just saying you&#39;ve failed.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I think we all need to succeed at something. You need encouragement rather than being told you haven&#39;t done very well.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the motion is passed at the conference, PAT&#39;s ruling council will decide how it should inform the association&#39;s policy, which currently states that &quot;all individual achievement should be recognised.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMrs Beattie, PAT Suffolk Federation Secretary and field officer, said she would not totally rule out ever using the word in education - but stressed encouragement was the key.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I think it can stop children in their tracks,&quot; she added. &quot;In a way we all deal with failure, but if it stops us trying something that is terrible.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s an attitude of mind. I would not say never tell them that they (pupils) haven&#39;t managed something but we&#39;ve all got to strive. It&#39;s a case of getting the balance right.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I would be surprised if we didn&#39;t get the motion through because I think there are enough teachers at all levels who know that, with little ones, you&#39;ve got to get them motivated and with the older ones you&#39;ve got to give them confidence going into exams.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I feel very strongly about the idea. It&#39;s a thing that has always coloured the way I taught.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27939,"nextTopicId":27958}}
