The traditionally-schooled bias of the observer would be more likely to comprehend the Unschooling paradigm shift if it were presented singly.<br/>\n<br/>\nCeci</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322395682,"authorName":"Button Rios-Sherman","from":"Button Rios-Sherman &lt;shermantribe@...&gt;","profile":"shermantribe","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] What would be a good &quot;poster family&quot; for unschooling?","postDate":"1304622796","msgId":61070,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBTkxrVGluaUNScXRrMFRjRDhlNXNjVkN4Q3ZhZmdIY0hnQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDZDREQzRDI5LTg3ODktNDYwOS1CQUQyLURCMzUzM0FGMEZDOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEIyM0JEMzA1LUVFM0ItNDBGNC1BMDlBLTEwNDNFMERCNEE4NUBTYW5kcmFEb2RkLmNvbT4JPEJBTkxrVGlrZVhjaWZCamJibXNUSE0tTVVTPVJFVGhzQVZRQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgk8NkNERDNEMjktODc4OS00NjA5LUJBRDItREIzNTMzQUYwRkM4QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61068,"nextInTopic":61088,"prevInTime":61069,"nextInTime":61071,"topicId":61062,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It was a nice conversation.  She&#39;s a TV producer, and they&#39;re looking into the possibility of interviewing an unschooling family.  It&#39;s not for sure. <br/>\n<br/>\nMostly we talked about unschooling itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe asked me what kind of family I would like to see featured, if they do this show, and I said I thought they should be articulate, not too extreme,  photogenic, and have a solid, joyful, peaceful family.   She&#39;s interested in a family with children of different ages.  A younger-than-12 plus a teen might be ideal, I think.  More than two would be a bonus.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo.  I told her I would ask for input or ideas here.  Read below what she&#39;s looking at proposing, and if you have ideas about what kinds of families would be good or bad, we can discuss that here, but please don&#39;t name any family in a bad light.   And if you want to recommend a particular family, either write to me and I can pass it on, or you can write directly to her if you would rather.   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rachael@...\">rachael@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nRachael emphasized that it&#39;s NOT &quot;a reality show,&quot; and isn&#39;t intended to be exploitative or irritating.  (not her exact words; I forget the exact words).    Also that this story is all in the potential planning stages.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn this one, I&#39;m glad to take mail on the side, because there might be things to say that might not be good for the whole list here.   So the idea of what an ideal family would be is on topic for the list!  More particulars of people and places aren&#39;t.   And though some Canadian families came to mind while I was speaking with her, I think they&#39;re just going for U.S.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for thinking about it,<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n========================<br/>\n<br/>\nDear Sandra,<br/>\n<br/>\n My name is Rachael and I&#39;m the story producer for a terrific series on the new Oprah Winfrey Network called OUR AMERICA with Lisa Ling. It&#39;s produced by part2 pictures, a documentary film and television company based in New York City.  This series features one-hour episodes that explore the important social issues in America today.  Our host, Lisa Ling, meets people, families or communities in unique circumstances and through her own personal exploration gains an understanding of their positions and their worlds.<br/>\n<br/>\nI�m writing to you because my job here is to develop story ideas for new show episodes.  A topic that is particularly timely and engaging is that of un-schooling.  We�re considering exploring two divergent styles of parenting�on the one hand the �Tiger Moms� of the world who are perhaps very strict, pushing their children in school or sports or music and authoritative with the type of learning their children experience.   On the other side are parents who do unschooling or other forms of non-traditional child rearing and education.  We like to profile different sets of parents and their children to see how they live out and embrace these wildly different viewpoints of child rearing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see from your website that you are actively involved with unschooling, have written a book and have raised your three children with this philosophy.  I would love to pick your brain!  This is all exploratory at the moment and my goals in talking with you would be to learn more about unschooling and other child rearing elements that would fall under this umbrella and perhaps some advice as to finding the right family to profile for this story.<br/>\n. . . .<br/>\nRachael Profiloski<br/>\npart2 pictures<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":61064,"nextTopicId":61139}}
