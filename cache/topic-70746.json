Most people don&#39;t do that in normal<br/>\nsocial situations like a birthday party or even a park day gathering - they<br/>\ndon&#39;t bluntly and clearly flat-out contradict or criticize another person.<br/>\nThey don&#39;t say things like, &quot;That is not kind,&quot; or &quot;That won&#39;t help your<br/>\nfamily&#39;s happiness.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople come here for that kind of honesty, but even for those of us who<br/>\nwant it, it is strong stuff and feels quite rough at times. We&#39;re looking<br/>\nfor each others&#39; weaknesses (in behavior and thinking) and pointing them<br/>\nout. In public. We might think we are just offering ideas and letting<br/>\npeople pick and choose - but they are responses to specific incidences<br/>\ninvolving people&#39;s real children and clearly people feel sensitive and get<br/>\ndefensive because they feel attacked (no matter how many times we repeat<br/>\nthe idea that if the shoe doesn&#39;t fit, don&#39;t put it on).<br/>\n<br/>\nOther places, people are invited to a tea party - everybody is sweet and<br/>\nsoothing and careful with each others&#39; sensitive feelings and anything that<br/>\nmight contradict someone else&#39;s idea is sugar-coated and offered on a tray<br/>\nwith other sweets and if the person chooses to ignore it, everybody<br/>\npretends it was never even there. The blunt statements and direct<br/>\ncontradictions and commenting on things people didn&#39;t necessarily mean to<br/>\nreveal and so on - that is rough stuff to be on the receiving end of.

You can&#39;t play with us.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are doing something like martial arts. People come here and we work out<br/>\ntogether - in a dojo they punch and kick and here we use words to critique<br/>\neach other for a reason. In martial arts it is to improve stamina,<br/>\nstrength, balance, centered thinking, calmness, quickness, etc. Here it is<br/>\nto support our kids natural learning and live joy-filled lives outside of<br/>\nschool. There is nothing that we&#39;re doing here that is for the purpose of<br/>\nhurting or insulting or scaring someone, but if they wander into the dojo<br/>\nand onto the mat without understanding what is going on, they&#39;re going to<br/>\nfeel scared, hurt, attacked and the same is true here.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe critics, like Wendy, are more or less saying that &quot;I&quot; shouldn&#39;t be<br/>\nallowed to study martial arts because some people keep on wandering into<br/>\nthe dojo and onto the mat and getting hurt. We have warning signs all OVER<br/>\nthe place and people are ignoring or not understanding them. And we keep<br/>\ntrying to make the warning signs bigger, brighter, more clear, harder to<br/>\nignore.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is extremely rude for people to leave a group and go off other<br/>\nplaces and talk about it behind the backs of those of us involved. Tacky<br/>\nrude. Gossip.

Do whatever you want to do - nobody is making you<br/>\ncome or stay here. So why so much hostility carried on and on and on.

No doubt that&#39;s true, because it IS being discussed and done all kinds of ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat the article seems to suggest, though, is that every discussion should accept and support and affirm every OTHER idea of every other unschooler, past present and future, as equally valid and acceptable, withotu any benefit or advantage in anything whatsoever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t feel like doing that with my volunteer time.  If everything is equally valid, the needles on all compasses spin, and there is no north.  There is no way to &quot;make the better choice&quot; if there is no &quot;better.&quot;  If all ideas are equal, I&#39;ve just wasted thousands of hours and a couple of decades imagining, wrongly, that there were some ideas that could help people live more peacefully, and some ideas that could help parents overcome some of their own childhood wounds in the course of providing as peaceful an environment as they could for the children they choose to bring into their families.    I didn&#39;t even know, for the first ten years of all this, that if the ideas were really internalized and started to work in the families in such ways that the parents REALLY got it, that it would make thei marriages stronger, too.  I didn&#39;t know, for the first six of my unschooling that my own family would be happier and I would be more at peace if I stopped trying to get the kids to clean the house, and did it while they were playing or sleeping.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve had an amorphous, changing but growing co-op of idea sharing for a long time, from *Prodigy through AOL and all the discussions that some of us participate in still.  Ideas have become as polished as rocks in a tumbler, as smooth as long-sanded hardwood.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe kind of unschooling we talk about works the same way for any child, if the parents care to understand and apply it. There&#39;s not one kind of unschooling for ADD or Asperger&#39;s or Blind or Dyslexic and another for Average or Gifted or Idiot-Savant (whatever the term of the season is for that).  In that way, Schuyler&#39;s right. The same principles work, when it&#39;s about seeing the child directly and helping him do what he wants to do.  Provide safety and peace and attention and things to perceive and play with.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo if someone says &quot;True or false:  Unschooling is one-size-fits-all,&quot; I guess the answer will need to be &quot;What do you  mean?&quot; or &quot;Why are you asking?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Commentary On...","postDate":"1362187639","msgId":70750,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJDMjY5RThGLTdCQTQtNDJBMS05MEQxLTYxNzY5MTU3NEQyMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEQ5NDVCNjg4LTNBM0EtNDM4MC04NDFFLUQwNTJENTEzQjBEMEBnbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PEQ5NDVCNjg4LTNBM0EtNDM4MC04NDFFLUQwNTJENTEzQjBEMEBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":70746,"nextInTopic":70751,"prevInTime":70749,"nextInTime":70751,"topicId":70746,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-These provocative discussions in favor of paying close attention and remaining positively engaged in the process with our children and partners are what I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1320638081\">-=-These provocative discussions in favor of paying close attention and remaining positively engaged in the process with our children and partners are what I have derived from The Always Learning List.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, Eileen.

I sensed the opposition quickly and recognized the dispute. I had no input there but saw the implications against my most valued resource for understanding how to unschool better.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe complaints on facebook and in this most recent article seem to miss the point of discussing the challenging ideas of preserving marriage and family peace as a pilar of better unschooling. Listening  to and supporting a child and honoring desires for the sake of real/individual learning. Whether about eating, video game play or watching tv, or extending principles of kindness and honoring to partners. These provocative discussions in favor of paying close attention and remaining positively engaged in the process with our children and partners are what I have derived from The Always Learning List.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Wendy has misunderstood and perhaps has never excersized what she has written.The misconstrued idea of freedom as it pertains to radical unschooling has been clarified many times over on this list and no one is forcing any opinions upon me about how to be a better partner with my children or my spouse. There are thought provoking discussions that have helped me to question and grow as I make deliberate choices, every minute, every day and there are  no<br/>\nhave-to&#39;s!<br/>\nThat&#39;s what I love about The Always Learning List! <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the contrary Wendy&#39;s words are not helpful. I find the article vague, negative and an inaccurate.<br/>\n<br/>\nA long time ago Joyce&#39;s website pointed me toward joy and real happiness in learning with my family. Her site led to compelling discussions and interchange among contributors here on the Always Learning List.<br/>\nI find subtlety in Sandra&#39;s  plain language (some call blunt). It is genius to me! I get her. <br/>\n(I love how she states that she likes her husband Keith) this is so sweetly provacitive. <br/>\nIt is such a good thought. I&#39;ve already seen it repeated and I don&#39;t think it coincidence. What Sandra has to say makes good sense to me. Real ideas to be borrowed and put to good use!<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me Sandra presents peices to a puzzle. She gives excellent clues in her plain language(blunt to some) to solve your very own mysteries. She shares just enough wisdom and opinion based on personal history and real experiences! She preserves tons of collected wisdoms, experiences and opinions of others and claims no glory for herself because it is your own process that you find answers to your very own questions. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe knows how learning occurs. It is individual! It is not One-Size-Fits-All ever.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70821,"nextTopicId":70838}}
