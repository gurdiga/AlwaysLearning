But as i played i realised the parts that make me crazy.... The maps and eye coordination and the speed with which cars or characters move. I could do super mario car racing on the wii. That i found fun. But when raghu moves around in say Skyrim or GTA and other PS3 games and even in Minecraft... I find the movement in space and jerky movements make me feel tired and even nauseus sometimes. <div>\n<br></div><div>But i will make a list of games i like. Then figure out the best bits from each and see which ones the kids also love. And then ask on the unschoolinggamers group for suggestions. I think that may not be in the scope of this group.</div>\n<div><br></div><div>Actually they love it any time i play :-) but for a long while now i have not enjoyed Raghu&#39;s choices. I mean for me to play.

No tv (the internet was still young), rarely movies, no video games. When I had my daughter and started learning about unschooling, I was a bit dismayed at the idea of maybe needing to Get a tv... it seemed excessive - why would we need one with so much nature around? One of the ideas that helped me move past my own biases was someone on... I think it was unschooling.<u></u>com at the time wrote: your children aren&#39;t you. It was kind of a shock, even though, intellectually, I knew it was true I kind of had this expectation that My dreams were so wonderful that of course my kids would naturally share them and see how lovely my\n dream-inspired life was. It was a shock to realize that I was actually deliberately limiting my kids to my dreams, without having ever considered theirs. Yeow.&nbsp; I took the good advice of unschoolers, though, and eased in to things: first, videos. At the time it was still the old cassettes, then dvds. Mo was little and had some very strong reactions to certain kinds of movies and shows, so that actually let me look for things which wouldn&#39;t upset her... which led me to bringing home some movies I wouldn&#39;t have expected. Like the Barbie movies - the back-woods commy in me was appalled, but Mo loved the stories of bold girls and women and friendly talking animals saving the day. Barbie and Disney movies didn&#39;t give her a warped self image, they fed her love of stories and imagery.&nbsp; Then my stepson moved in with us full time and we got his mom&#39;s agreement to pull him out of school and unschool and it seemed unreasonable to Not\n have tv. Living in the hills, there&#39;s no free broadcast tv - there&#39;s only satellite. So we got a satellite hook-up. That was a big help in terms of deschooling with Ray since tv had been regulated at his mom&#39;s house - it was a way for us to show we were... on his side I guess.&nbsp; For Mo, the sudden flood of new cartoons was kind of a revelation though - she started drawing Big Time, head over heels in love with all the various styles of drawing she was seeing. She drew and drew and drew, playing with different ways of expressing emotion, movement, character attributes. Pages and pages every day, of things she saw on tv, sometimes drawing the characters from one show in the style of another, sometimes bringing in characters from books or movies. It was... amazing. It reminded me of a certain kind of art curriculum, actually, where students imitate the styles of various artists and then try to create their own works in the style of\n particular movements - but it wasn&#39;t a curriculum, it was something she was doing out of pure fascination. That was probably the death-knell to my fears about &quot;technology&amp;qu<u></u>ot; - seeing Mo explode into drawing like that. We first got video games for Ray and by then the internet was a real thing, even if we only had dial-up. He got excited about playing an online multiplayer game and it was really fascinating to watch him do that. He&#39;d been through homeschooling and public school, and had seemed to be one of those kids who had no motivation or sense of determination.<u></u>.. until he started playing video games. In games, he started to do something I&#39;d never seen him do before, which was to do long, tedious tasks for a fairly abstract goal. Like levelling up a dozen different skills so that he could do a particular quest. Morgan does things like that too, although she&#39;s more emotional about it - she&#39;ll fail and fail and fail and\n get frustrated, cry, and give up... only to go back and try again later.&nbsp; -- <font style=\"BACKGROUND-COLOR:rgb(255,255,255);\" face=\"tahoma, sans-serif\">Hema A.

No tv (the internet was still young), rarely movies, no video games. When I had my daughter and started learning about unschooling, I was a bit dismayed at the idea of maybe needing to Get a tv... it seemed excessive - why would we need one with so much nature around? One of the ideas that helped me move past my own biases was someone on... I think it was unschooling.<u></u>com at the time wrote: your children aren&#39;t you. It was kind of a shock, even though, intellectually, I knew it was true I kind of had this expectation that My dreams were so wonderful that of course my kids would naturally share them and see how lovely my dream-inspired life was. It was a shock to realize that I was actually deliberately limiting my kids to my dreams, without having ever considered theirs. Yeow. <br>\n<br>I took the good advice of unschoolers, though, and eased in to things: first, videos. At the time it was still the old cassettes, then dvds. Mo was little and had some very strong reactions to certain kinds of movies and shows, so that actually let me look for things which wouldn&#39;t upset her... which led me to bringing home some movies I wouldn&#39;t have expected. Like the Barbie movies - the back-woods commy in me was appalled, but Mo loved the stories of bold girls and women and friendly talking animals saving the day. Barbie and Disney movies didn&#39;t give her a warped self image, they fed her love of stories and imagery. <br>\n<br>Then my stepson moved in with us full time and we got his mom&#39;s agreement to pull him out of school and unschool and it seemed unreasonable to Not have tv. Living in the hills, there&#39;s no free broadcast tv - there&#39;s only satellite. So we got a satellite hook-up. That was a big help in terms of deschooling with Ray since tv had been regulated at his mom&#39;s house - it was a way for us to show we were... on his side I guess. <br>\n<br><br>For Mo, the sudden flood of new cartoons was kind of a revelation though - she started drawing Big Time, head over heels in love with all the various styles of drawing she was seeing. She drew and drew and drew, playing with different ways of expressing emotion, movement, character attributes. Pages and pages every day, of things she saw on tv, sometimes drawing the characters from one show in the style of another, sometimes bringing in characters from books or movies. It was... amazing. It reminded me of a certain kind of art curriculum, actually, where students imitate the styles of various artists and then try to create their own works in the style of particular movements - but it wasn&#39;t a curriculum, it was something she was doing out of pure fascination. That was probably the death-knell to my fears about &quot;technology&amp;qu<u></u>ot; - seeing Mo explode into drawing like that.<br>\n<br><br>We first got video games for Ray and by then the internet was a real thing, even if we only had dial-up. He got excited about playing an online multiplayer game and it was really fascinating to watch him do that. He&#39;d been through homeschooling and public school, and had seemed to be one of those kids who had no motivation or sense of determination.<u></u>.. until he started playing video games. In games, he started to do something I&#39;d never seen him do before, which was to do long, tedious tasks for a fairly abstract goal.

No tv (the internet was still young), rarely movies, no video games. When I had my daughter and started learning about unschooling, I was a bit dismayed at the idea of maybe needing to Get a tv... it seemed excessive - why would we need one with so much nature around? One of the ideas that helped me move past my own biases was someone on... I think it was unschooling.com at the time wrote: your children aren&#39;t you. It was kind of a shock, even though, intellectually, I knew it was true I kind of had this expectation that My dreams were so wonderful that of course my kids would naturally share them and see how lovely my dream-inspired life was. It was a shock to realize that I was actually deliberately limiting my kids to my dreams, without having ever considered theirs. Yeow.&nbsp;<br><br>I took the good advice of unschoolers, though, and eased in to things: first, videos. At the time it was still the old cassettes, then dvds. Mo was little and had some very strong reactions to certain kinds of movies and shows, so that actually let me look for things which wouldn&#39;t upset her... which led me to bringing home some movies I wouldn&#39;t have expected. Like the Barbie movies - the back-woods commy in me was appalled, but Mo loved the stories of bold girls and women and friendly talking animals saving the day. Barbie and Disney movies didn&#39;t give her a warped self image, they fed her love of stories and imagery.&nbsp;<br><br>Then my stepson moved in with us full time and we got his mom&#39;s agreement to pull him out of school and unschool and it seemed unreasonable to Not have tv. Living in the hills, there&#39;s no free broadcast tv - there&#39;s only satellite. So we got a satellite hook-up. That was a big help in terms of deschooling with Ray since tv had been regulated at his mom&#39;s house - it was a way for us to show we were... on his side I guess.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><span style=\"line-height:13.333333015441895px;font-size:13px;\"><br></span></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><span style=\"line-height:13.333333015441895px;font-size:13px;\">For Mo, the sudden flood of new cartoons was kind of a revelation though - she started drawing Big Time, head over heels in love with all the various styles of drawing she was seeing. She drew and drew and drew, playing with different ways of expressing emotion, movement, character attributes. Pages and pages every day, of things she saw on tv, sometimes drawing the characters from one show in the style of another, sometimes bringing in characters from books or movies. It was... amazing. It reminded me of a certain kind of art curriculum, actually, where students imitate the styles of various artists and then try to create their own works in the style of particular movements - but it wasn&#39;t a curriculum, it was something she was doing out of pure fascination. That was probably the death-knell to my fears about &quot;technology&quot; - seeing Mo explode into drawing like that.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><span style=\"line-height:13.333333015441895px;font-size:13px;\"><br></span></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\">We first got video games for Ray and by then the internet was a real thing, even if we only had dial-up. He got excited about playing an online multiplayer game and it was really fascinating to watch him do that. He&#39;d been through homeschooling and public school, and had seemed to be one of those kids who had no motivation &nbsp;or sense of determination... until he started playing video games. In games, he started to do something I&#39;d never seen him do before, which was to do long, tedious tasks for a fairly abstract goal. Like levelling up a dozen different skills so that he could do a particular quest. Morgan does things like that too, although she&#39;s more emotional about it - she&#39;ll fail and fail and fail and get frustrated, cry, and give up... only to go back and try again later.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><br></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\">Something I didn&#39;t realize before we had video games was how many games these days are stories - kind of like those choose-your-adventure books, but better because the players are actually making real decisions in the context of the game. Once I discovered that I started looking for games I would enjoy playing too - and I found that Mo and I both enjoy playing games cooperatively, helping each other in the game. Lately we&#39;ve been playing PC games of the adventure/hidden object variety - again, story games, but with periodic puzzles and treasure-hunt scenes rather than fight scenes. Those are nice to play on the laptop, snuggled up in bed together. Despite her love of stories, Mo never liked being read to, so this is especially sweet for me - I finally get to curl up in bed with my little girl and a story... it&#39;s just an interactive story rather than a book. Playing games together also gives us a chance to talk - Mo&#39;s not much of a talker, so that&#39;s a Big Deal! The games give us conversation starters and a chance to sit side by side and chat, rather than face to face, which is really helpful.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><br></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\">Mo&#39;s 12 now, Ray&#39;s 20 and it&#39;s sometimes surprising that I used to be so negative about tv, games, computers. Ray has gone from playing lots and lots of video games to woodworking, blacksmithing, travelling, working on farms, hiking, camping, being in nature. Mo spends a lot of time writing, drawing, and socializing, mostly via the internet. She also spends hours ever day on the trampoline. She still loves stories, especially graphic stories - comics and manga as well as movies and games - although recently she has started reading books. Tv, movies, the internet, and video games haven&#39;t wrecked my kids. They&#39;ve made their worlds bigger - which is a good thing, living in the middle of nowhere as we do. They&#39;ve discovered things which would have been much harder without those resources. They&#39;ve met people online (some through games) and then gone on to meet them in person, and they both use the internet (including games) to keep up with people they&#39;ve met on various travels.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><br></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\">Oh! I almost forgot - one more thing I noticed about games in particular. The more computers advance, the more overlap there is between the way &quot;serious&quot; computers work and the way games work. That makes sense if you consider that most programmers and designers in the computer industry have played games and are creating for people who have probably also played games. But it also means that Playing games sets kids up to have a more &quot;intuitive&quot; understanding of the ways computers work, the same way growing up taking public transportation sets city kids up to have an intuitive understanding of buses and subways. Games are a big part of the technological &quot;environment&quot;.&nbsp;</p></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] RE: the need or not to introduce video games to your children","postDate":"1386159037","msgId":72718,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJFMEM3NjY0LUY5RTEtNEU3Qi05MEJCLThGNDk0NDE4ODUzNUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBTXVqbWR2T3MtRytUaDdDX1NvPVNIcEJoZVRtZkdPdU11V042VnlhLWIydHhoeEFXQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PHBnNmJ3NTdzOWpiZmZieG9nNmh2NDZrNi4xMzg2MTEyMTIxMDY2QGVtYWlsLmFuZHJvaWQuY29tPiA8RTM0RjNGOTQtNjVERS00OTAxLUFEOUMtMDhBMTU4RjZEMzlGQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8bDdsdmthKzFkYm0wNm5AWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPiA8Q0FNdWptZHR6TjFtRHlHTVpjMUpmQUxwTjBxTEJrKzdraG9Nd1RKWndIWHYxeWpQR3V3QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8NDkzN0QxOUUtQUIwRC00OEE5LUEyMUMtODY3MEEyOUUwODcwQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8Q0FNdWptZHZPcy1HK1RoN0NfU289U0hwQmhlVG1mR091TXVXTjZWeWEtYjJ0eGh4QVdBQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":72717,"nextInTopic":72719,"prevInTime":72717,"nextInTime":72719,"topicId":72679,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-You really ought to put this on bumper stickers, pins and refrigerator magnets!

Do I want to? Well, considering I was addicted to Donkey Kong as a kid, and yearned desperately for the Pacman I never got (in the 80&#39;s) I would probably LOVE video games, personally, if I had time to spend on here. Do we want our kids to engage in gaming? I would say right now I would feel deeply uncomfortable with it. To be honest. I want our children to be out playing in the mud, which they do. That&#39;s me, and my values. Right along with Barbie, video gaming is right there smack in the middle of my discomfort zone. Right now 8 yo is yearning for a Barbie and an IPOD and I asked her what would she do if I allowed her to, she said Reading Eggs (an australian educational program which is used in schools alot now) for 2-3 hours. Clearly I have lots of of work to do in distinguising between parenting - good parenting - all of my own values and ideals and standards which I have worked hard to uphold in our home - and what the kids want!

You are using the computer to find information offered by many people from different parts of the world at different levels of their understanding about unschooling, and you are asking if we think it&#39;s a computer is a necessary addition to make in the lives of your children.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt wouldn&#39;t be any different for your children.  They too would be looking for information, stimulation, challenges, ideas, and/or creative input from people from different parts of the world in different stages of whatever it is they are interested in.  Just like you can&#39;t find the answers to your questions about unschooling in the limited (though I&#39;m not saying not rich) environment of your home, so too will it become increasingly difficult for your children to explore the things that captivate their imaginations.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIs it necessary?

I have some favourite books I could recommend.

Not because you are &quot;limiting them&quot; or &quot;keeping them from them,&quot; but rather because we can&#39;t expose our children to everything under the sun. Many unschooled kids have never been camping because their parents don&#39;t camp, many have never traveled very far from home because that&#39;s not what their parents do, many don&#39;t have much variety in their diets because their parents have simple tastes. That doesn&#39;t mean those families aren&#39;t unschooling. However, if a kid asks for things that are then refused, that seems like something you might want to explore. Your kids are young, so are probably not as aware of video games, etc. As they get older, they will likely be interested in exploring those things, but for the time being, if you and your husband aren&#39;t that interested in them and don&#39;t feel compelled to run out and share them, I, personally wouldn&#39;t even think about it much.....as I said, much the same as the parent who is not a camper, shouldn&#39;t be worried about the fact that their child has never slept in a tent.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:12.800000190734863px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\">With time, your kids will start wanting different things.

What&#39;s important is a rich, supportive environment for kids to explore their interests in and discover new interests. So I wouldn&#39;t focus on video games. I would look at the big picture of where your own preferences may be limiting your kids&#39; worlds and limiting their ability to explore broadly and deeply to discover what interests them.</div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;ll take a little detour for a minute. Sometimes the term unschooling gets confused with natural learning. Natural learning is how humans learn by exploring, trying things out to see what happens, building an understanding of how the world works. It&#39;s what we&#39;re hardwired to do. Humans will learn naturally no matter what the environment. That environment can be as spare as a dusty farm in the wilds of Africa or a US suburban home filled with all the latest technology.</div><div><br></div><div>Unschooling, though, is more than natural learning. It&#39;s deliberately creating a rich environment tailored to your kids interests for them to explore in as a substitute for the enriching and broadening experience that schools -- ideally -- are supposed to provide. So if parents&#39; focus isn&#39;t on opening the world to their kids as much as they are reasonably able, then they aren&#39;t unschooling. They&#39;re allowing their kids to learn naturally, yes, but they aren&#39;t unschooling.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Your kids will learn from what you have. But how are your own likes and dislikes limiting them in exploring more of the world they will be moving into as adults?</div><div><br></div><div>You and your husband had the opportunity to explore tv and other things as you grew up. For whatever reason you decided tv, the internet, games weren&#39;t something you needed much. But your kids aren&#39;t getting to decide that. You&#39;ve limited their lives to what you believe is valuable.</div><div><br></div><div>Not all kids like games. But your kids can&#39;t discover whether they are kids-who-like-games without being able to try them. And I think the limited internet is more confining than the lack of games. Providing internet isn&#39;t something a family should put themselves into dire straits to provide! Especially when your kids are still so young. But libraries often have decent internet. I would go out of my way to make sure they have the ability to explore it often as they grow so you can make thoughtful choices about how to get more of what they&#39;re using the most.</div><div><br></div><div>As for games, you don&#39;t need to invest in a video game system. You can download apps for free or for a few dollars to try a variety of things out.</div><div><br></div><div>Rather than plunging in blindly there&#39;s a Facebook group &quot;My unschooler is interested in ...&quot; that may have suggestions in past threads that match your kids. &nbsp;If not, you can open up a new thread.</div><div><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/383815885025681/\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/383815885025681/</a></div><div><br></div><div>Also the Unschooling Gamers group.

DH and I live in remote Australia with our four children aged 8 to 1 none of whome have been to school but DD1 has been exposed to some curriculum. I have been reading unschooling literature on and off for about four years now, since DD1 was 4, including John Holt and have just finished Sandra&#39;s Big book of unschooling (ebook) which was SO challenging and yet so refreshing! Anyway, as I return to what I feel is my real calling, after meandering the curriculum wilderness (including a longish stay with waldorf which I find to be greatly at odds much of unschooling), I have a question which I hope I am okay to ask here.
