Lately I&#39;ve started a file to save some of my posts, much like a journal, and I&#39;m very excited about it. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: groundhoggirl <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:alwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">alwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, December 09, 2001 11:02 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] SORRY<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  First of all, I would like to say this will be my only post of the day <br/>\n  and don&#39;t plan to turn on the computer tomorrow.  I was almost afraid to <br/>\n  open my mail a few minutes ago.  I managed to click on &quot;compose&quot; before <br/>\n  I could see all the responses to last night&#39;s posts.  I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m a <br/>\n  bit too sensitive and, even though I&#39;m already 42, still lacking the <br/>\n  strength and confidence I wish I had.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I would like to apologize for my lack of clarity on the subject of <br/>\n  saying &quot;no&quot; to children who are causing a scene at Walmart (or <br/>\n  where-ever).  In my initial response to the original post I apparently <br/>\n  neglected to add that, in addition to saying &quot;no&quot; and, standing your <br/>\n  ground, you would, OF COURSE, explain why, be honest and respectful to <br/>\n  your children, and tell them &quot;I&#39;ll be able to afford it next week&quot;, or <br/>\n  something like that.  I honestly thought (especially since this is an <br/>\n  unschooling list and it is visited by unschoolers or parents who are <br/>\n  sensitive enough to even consider unschooling) that this would be <br/>\n  understood.  I obviously was very wrong and I apologize very much for <br/>\n  giving the wrong impression .  Believe me, I am not a cold and mean <br/>\n  person.  On the contrary, I am a very giving mother.  I cherish my boys <br/>\n  and will do anything to maintain their happiness, sense of security and <br/>\n  confidence and, of course, love of learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n  With regard to allowing my boys to display unpleasant behavior at the <br/>\n  store because they are unhappy about something, I do not apologize.  <br/>\n  This is something that has worked for my boys and me.  This is really <br/>\n  something we hardly experience anymore because they are already 7 years <br/>\n  old.  But, on rare occasions, it does still happen, especially if <br/>\n  Leroy&#39;s blood sugar is too high or too low.  He is a Juvenile Diabetic.  <br/>\n  After exhausting all ways of trying to calm him which includes repeating <br/>\n  my explanations why he can&#39;t have something, explaining to him he will <br/>\n  surely get it another time, when we can afford it, giving him hugs, <br/>\n  etc.  - if all of this does not work, well, then, I let him express his <br/>\n  feelings.  I&#39;m very sorry if it inconveniences strangers, but as a <br/>\n  daughter of a very controlling and repressive mother, I believe in <br/>\n  allowing little children to express, in any way they wish, their <br/>\n  happiness, sadness,  or anger.  I know you don&#39;t all agree and I really <br/>\n  don&#39;t know anyone who feels the way I feel, but, from my own personal <br/>\n  experiences, this is how I honestly feel the situation should be handled.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My boys are very sweet and loving boys.  They are very high-spirited and <br/>\n  happy.  Both have serious health issues and I believe their emotional <br/>\n  well-being is very important in keeping them physically healthy.  Paul <br/>\n  received a bone-marrow transplant in August 1999.  He was diagnosed with <br/>\n  a rare form of Leukemia and he had a very poor prognosis.  He has been <br/>\n  in remission for about 2 1/2 years.  We are very grateful to the doctors <br/>\n  at Texas Children&#39;s Hospital for saving our son&#39;s life.  Leroy&#39;s <br/>\n  diabetes is under very tight control so he is very healthy, otherwise.  <br/>\n  I would like to say that in addition to the doctors at TCH, my husband <br/>\n  and I take some of the credit for our boys&#39; good health today.  I firmly <br/>\n  believe that their emotional well-being is tied to their physical <br/>\n  well-being.  This is why I am so lenient with my boys.  I&#39;m sorry if <br/>\n  strangers are inconvenienced or annoyed at my boys, but my boys are more <br/>\n  important than they are.  That&#39;s how I truly feel.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think, on the whole, the public should have more patience with <br/>\n  children - especially here in Texas.  I&#39;m originally from Belgium and <br/>\n  very liberal Long Island, NY.<br/>\n<br/>\n  That&#39;s all I have to say.  I&#39;m not going to turn on my computer until <br/>\n  Tuesday.  I&#39;m just protecting myself, that&#39;s all.  I am way too <br/>\n  sensitive and take things too personally.  I just hope I didn&#39;t make <br/>\n  anybody angry.  On Tuesday, I&#39;ll probably start lurking for a while and <br/>\n  after a few days will probably start posting again.  I should have <br/>\n  recovered by them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sorry, if I&#39;ve been rambling.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Mimi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

I was almost afraid to <br/>\nopen my mail a few minutes ago.  I managed to click on &quot;compose&quot; before <br/>\nI could see all the responses to last night&#39;s posts.  I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m a <br/>\nbit too sensitive and, even though I&#39;m already 42, still lacking the <br/>\nstrength and confidence I wish I had.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to apologize for my lack of clarity on the subject of <br/>\nsaying &quot;no&quot; to children who are causing a scene at Walmart (or <br/>\nwhere-ever).  In my initial response to the original post I apparently <br/>\nneglected to add that, in addition to saying &quot;no&quot; and, standing your <br/>\nground, you would, OF COURSE, explain why, be honest and respectful to <br/>\nyour children, and tell them &quot;I&#39;ll be able to afford it next week&quot;, or <br/>\nsomething like that.  I honestly thought (especially since this is an <br/>\nunschooling list and it is visited by unschoolers or parents who are <br/>\nsensitive enough to even consider unschooling) that this would be <br/>\nunderstood.  I obviously was very wrong and I apologize very much for <br/>\ngiving the wrong impression .  Believe me, I am not a cold and mean <br/>\nperson.  On the contrary, I am a very giving mother.  I cherish my boys <br/>\nand will do anything to maintain their happiness, sense of security and <br/>\nconfidence and, of course, love of learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith regard to allowing my boys to display unpleasant behavior at the <br/>\nstore because they are unhappy about something, I do not apologize.  <br/>\nThis is something that has worked for my boys and me.  This is really <br/>\nsomething we hardly experience anymore because they are already 7 years <br/>\nold.  But, on rare occasions, it does still happen, especially if <br/>\nLeroy&#39;s blood sugar is too high or too low.  He is a Juvenile Diabetic.  <br/>\nAfter exhausting all ways of trying to calm him which includes repeating <br/>\nmy explanations why he can&#39;t have something, explaining to him he will <br/>\nsurely get it another time, when we can afford it, giving him hugs, <br/>\netc.  - if all of this does not work, well, then, I let him express his <br/>\nfeelings.  I&#39;m very sorry if it inconveniences strangers, but as a <br/>\ndaughter of a very controlling and repressive mother, I believe in <br/>\nallowing little children to express, in any way they wish, their <br/>\nhappiness, sadness,  or anger.  I know you don&#39;t all agree and I really <br/>\ndon&#39;t know anyone who feels the way I feel, but, from my own personal <br/>\nexperiences, this is how I honestly feel the situation should be handled.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy boys are very sweet and loving boys.  They are very high-spirited and <br/>\nhappy.  Both have serious health issues and I believe their emotional <br/>\nwell-being is very important in keeping them physically healthy.  Paul <br/>\nreceived a bone-marrow transplant in August 1999.  He was diagnosed with <br/>\na rare form of Leukemia and he had a very poor prognosis.  He has been <br/>\nin remission for about 2 1/2 years.  We are very grateful to the doctors <br/>\nat Texas Children&#39;s Hospital for saving our son&#39;s life.  Leroy&#39;s <br/>\ndiabetes is under very tight control so he is very healthy, otherwise.  <br/>\nI would like to say that in addition to the doctors at TCH, my husband <br/>\nand I take some of the credit for our boys&#39; good health today.  I firmly <br/>\nbelieve that their emotional well-being is tied to their physical <br/>\nwell-being.  This is why I am so lenient with my boys.  I&#39;m sorry if <br/>\nstrangers are inconvenienced or annoyed at my boys, but my boys are more <br/>\nimportant than they are.  That&#39;s how I truly feel.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think, on the whole, the public should have more patience with <br/>\nchildren - especially here in Texas.  I&#39;m originally from Belgium and <br/>\nvery liberal Long Island, NY.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s all I have to say.  I&#39;m not going to turn on my computer until <br/>\nTuesday.  I&#39;m just protecting myself, that&#39;s all.  I am way too <br/>\nsensitive and take things too personally.  I just hope I didn&#39;t make <br/>\nanybody angry.  On Tuesday, I&#39;ll probably start lurking for a while and <br/>\nafter a few days will probably start posting again.
