I know I&#39;m lucky---especially <br/>\nto have it with my first-born. I&#39;ve always tried to treat him the way I wish <br/>\nsomeone would treat me. I remember what it was like to be five and nine and <br/>\nthirteen and....<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s very agreeable and compliant---and so am I, to a degree. And we&#39;re both <br/>\nrisk-takers: at his age, I was jumping five foot fences on my horses <br/>\n(sometimes what parents don&#39;t know won&#39;t hurt them! &lt;G&gt;). Cameron likes jumping off <br/>\nbuildings and out of windows. I&#39;ve taken a few pictures of his doing this (at his <br/>\nrequest)----but most times I&#39;d rather not know it&#39;s happening. The skating <br/>\ncan be dangerous too---and it doesn&#39;t help that he likes to watch clips of those <br/>\nNASTY falls the skaters take!-----EEEEW!   But the difference is: he knows I <br/>\nwon&#39;t &quot;forbid&quot; it; he knows I used to do it too (not the skating and <br/>\njumping----but dangerous stuff, and I hated to wear my helmet too, when riding!); he <br/>\nknows that, if it REALLY disturbs me and if I ask him to stop or back off, he&#39;s <br/>\ngone too far for MY comfort level and he respects that. He&#39;ll quit---for the <br/>\nmoment. He also understands that Duncan is still little (7), and some common <br/>\nsense is good around littl&#39;uns.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t have any &quot;rules&quot; about what he can do or not do. Most of his friends <br/>\ndo though. I think that helps a lot---seeing the silly rules that other <br/>\nparents put on their kids. That beach scene you were talking about----he would have <br/>\nknown how uncomfortable it made me (because I would tell him! &lt;g&gt;) and come <br/>\nin--- I think, because he knows that under &quot;normal&quot; circumstances, it&#39;s OK by <br/>\nme. I would never arbitrarily say that he must come in. He would do it because <br/>\nI would be afraid for him. I don&#39;t know, Patti---I guess it&#39;s just a genuine <br/>\nconcern for each other? We&#39;ve somehow &quot;agreed&quot; not to hurt each other?<br/>\n<br/>\nI liked Sandra&#39;s example of Kirby&#39;s driving. Cameron has his license too. I <br/>\nhave NO problem with his driving: he&#39;s very responsible and safe. When it DOES <br/>\nbother me is when he&#39;s picking up friends (not very responsible friends who <br/>\nseem to like to take advantage of him...and US, because we&#39;re so &quot;permissive&quot;!). <br/>\nI worry that they&#39;ll talk him into stupid stuff or whatever. He&#39;s getting <br/>\nless and less naive---and less trusting of them. That makes me feel good! &lt;G&gt; <br/>\nNothing stops the worry, though! <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know that there&#39;s a secret formula. I think we just &quot;click&quot;. I KNOW <br/>\nthat he would have been crushed had I been a more authoritative parent----he <br/>\njust can&#39;t handle that. He has a &quot;soft temperament&quot; (to use dog-trainer-speak! <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;). I think it helps that I LIKE him. I&#39;m genuinely DELIGHTED to share a <br/>\nhouse with him----not to mention our lives!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy other son is more of a challenge for me. He&#39;s more like his dad. I have to <br/>\nwork a little harder with that relationship. But I&#39;ve gained a bit of <br/>\nconfidence the first time &#39;round, so that helps! &lt;g&gt; And if you want it bad <br/>\nenough,..... &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16393,"nextTopicId":16473}}
