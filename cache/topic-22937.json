I can see in him that he is regaining some of the creativity <br/>\nand joy he had before school but more &#39;deschooling&#39; is still <br/>\nnecessary. Anyhow that just gives you a little information about our <br/>\nbackground what I would like to have some advise on is how to help <br/>\nhim to realize there are other families like ours - that there are <br/>\nother unschoolers - that it is okey for him to work on what he wants <br/>\nfor as long as he wants.<br/>\n    There are very few homeschoolers in our area and no other <br/>\nunschoolers and he gets to play with other children rarely, although <br/>\nthe last 2X we went to the park he did play with another child <br/>\nthere. But the last several times we went to the homeschool playtime <br/>\nhe prettymuch played by himself, I&#39;m thinking we should stop going. <br/>\nHe spends a lot of time at home working on building hotwheels <br/>\nracetracks and creating scenerios, building with blocks, he watches <br/>\na few TV shows but I have found since he has unlimited access then <br/>\nhe won&#39;t watch unless it&#39;s something he is really interested in <br/>\n(that&#39;s a GOOD thing IMHO.) He spends some time on his PS2 but even <br/>\nmore with his computer, but again it&#39;s not something he wants to do <br/>\nconstantly. I am hoping he will get better at typing and reading <br/>\nsoon so he can get some email &quot;pen pals&quot; that hopefully are <br/>\nunschoolers, or just interesting nice kids - I just sense that he <br/>\nfeels somewhat alone. <br/>\n   He has TONS of books on every subject imaginable and sometimes I <br/>\nread to him or we read together at his request, plus I think he <br/>\nreads a lot to himself on the computer without even realizing it. <br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if I need to stew more things - I&#39;m not sure what else <br/>\nto do? I think he has investigated lots of computer sites, again he <br/>\nhas unlimited access to a computer with internet, should I try to <br/>\nfind more websites for him? I feel like he prettymuch has accessed <br/>\nthe best kid&#39;s sites available and done the games that he liked <br/>\nuntil he is tired of them. I try to follow his lead but lately he <br/>\nseems in a lull, should I just let him wait it out or try to <br/>\nintroduce something new? I really would like for him to have more <br/>\nknowledge of other kids who are unschoolers. Are there any websites <br/>\nyet directed more towards unschoolers, perhaps with chatboards? Is <br/>\nthere anything that I could say to him that would help him? I wish I <br/>\ncould remember what it was liked to be 7 so I could relate to him <br/>\nmore, to help him figure out what he really wants to ask for more... <br/>\nThank you for your suggestions!
