The kids&#39; brains are developing while the reading  <br/>\nlessons are happening.

Yay!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Become blind to levels. Don&#39;t even look at them. In fact unless *she*  <br/>\nis drawn to a book with a level label, I&#39;d avoid them entirely.  <br/>\nThey&#39;re designed for reading practice, not as real books to read.  <br/>\nInterest is what will draw her to read. :-) The first book Kathryn  <br/>\nread on her own was Harry Potter.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; started letting her watch Angelina Ballerina, (I only let her watch  <br/>\n&gt; documentaries before), and then to encourage the reading, I got her  <br/>\n&gt; the books that went with it (which I wouldn&#39;t have done before,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Where you&#39;re getting stuck, I think, is you&#39;re looking at the  <br/>\ninformation and skills you want to get into her and trying to find  <br/>\nways to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeed her interests rather than skills. Don&#39;t worry about the skills! I  <br/>\n*know* that&#39;s hard to do! But read more about how other kids learned,  <br/>\nespecially at Sandra&#39;s site: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschooling.\">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling.</a> Kids  <br/>\npick up skills *as a side effect* in their quest to find out more  <br/>\nabout what fascinates them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s how kids learn to talk. They get better at talking by talking for  <br/>\nreal purposes, by using speech as a tool to get what they want. Kids  <br/>\nlearn how to read, manipulate numbers, figure out where countries are,  <br/>\ntell time all by sucking that information in in their quest to know  <br/>\nmore about the things that appeal to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t worry about the skills schooled kids are learning. Schooled kids  <br/>\nare in a waste land of interest. The most interesting thing in the  <br/>\nclassroom may be the clock ;-) Unschooled kids are learning about what  <br/>\ninterests them and picking up skills as they go along. If unschooled  <br/>\nkids were only quizzed on the skills, they&#39;ll look behind. But if  <br/>\nsomeone could quiz them on what they know -- pretty much impossible  <br/>\nsince they aren&#39;t going in any kind of order! -- they&#39;ll run circles  <br/>\naround kids in school ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning is like working a ginormous jigsaw puzzle. In school, they go  <br/>\nin order, working on the (supposedly) important parts of the important  <br/>\nsections, telling kids exactly what pieces to put where. And it&#39;s  <br/>\ndull. And it&#39;s hard *because* it&#39;s dull.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn real life, people plunge in doing whatever section of the puzzle  <br/>\nappeals to them, dropping one section to do something that catches  <br/>\ntheir interest, going back, working one section exclusively, working a  <br/>\nbit here and there and everywhere. It&#39;s messy and disorderly! But it&#39;s  <br/>\nfun and it works because that&#39;s how we&#39;re designed to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nReal learning is how kids learn to speak. And it works effortlessly  <br/>\nand wonderfully well. Artificial, hard learning in school is how kids  <br/>\nare taught foreign languages, focusing on the skills and the mechanics  <br/>\nand what can be tested. And it rarely achieves anything that lasts  <br/>\nbeyond the classroom.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; because I don&#39;t like how companies prey on children with attractive  <br/>\n&gt; marketing).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Kids aren&#39;t stupid! ;-) They don&#39;t enjoy programs and books  and songs  <br/>\nbecause of advertising. They may be initially drawn to something by  <br/>\nadvertising, but it if doesn&#39;t appeal to them, they&#39;ll drop it. Just  <br/>\nas adults do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a pervasive idea that kids are easily captivated. Just throw  <br/>\ncolorful cute characters at them and they&#39;ll follow those characters  <br/>\nanywhere. But that&#39;s a very low opinion of kids! All you have to do is  <br/>\nlook at real kids. They&#39;re picky!  They&#39;re discriminatory! But they  <br/>\nare kids and their tastes are different from adult tastes. They need  <br/>\nthings that adults don&#39;t understand and therefore look down on and  <br/>\ndismiss as trivial.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids learn how to make choices by making real choices. By trying  <br/>\nthings out. By finding what they like about what they try and what  <br/>\nthey don&#39;t like. And in the process they learn more about who they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s much easier -- much safer! -- for her to make choices now when  <br/>\nthe choices are Angelina and Captain Underpants than when she&#39;s older  <br/>\nand faced with decisions about alcohol, driving and sex!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She loves audio books, and has listened to the unabridged versions  <br/>\n&gt; of Little Women, Anne of Green Gables, Little Princess, Secret  <br/>\n&gt; Garden, the Little House on the Prairie series, and Misty of  <br/>\n&gt; Chincoteague. She listened to Little Women for about 5-6 months  <br/>\n&gt; straight.<br/>\n&gt; I tried to extend her learning<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t try to extend her learning. Expand her world  into other things  <br/>\nshe might think are interesting. Try -- for now! -- to avoid anything  <br/>\nyou think would be good for her to learn. This will be hard! But look  <br/>\nat your daughter. Look at *everything* that appeals to her, not just  <br/>\nthe parts you like that appeals to her. Help her explore what  <br/>\ninterests her. Run things you think she would be interested in through  <br/>\nher life.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she likes poop jokes, get her poop joke books. Look up poop jokes  <br/>\non the internet. Find poop songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking you just want to fill her with quality ingredients. (It&#39;s  <br/>\na common mom desire!) But she&#39;s not an empty vessel. She&#39;s a human  <br/>\nwith different tastes than you. She&#39;s a child with different interests  <br/>\nthan an adult. She has whatever interests she has for a reason. You  <br/>\ndon&#39;t need to understand why. To support her and her interests you  <br/>\njust need to help her get more of what she&#39;s trying to reach. And then  <br/>\nrun lots of other stuff you think might appeal through her life so she  <br/>\nhas access to more potential interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; by doing projects related to the stuff she was listening to: we made  <br/>\n&gt; a telegraph machine, I took her to places civil war related, she  <br/>\n&gt; planted a garden, she acted out many scenes with her brother, I took  <br/>\n&gt; them horse back riding, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>These are all cool things and I don&#39;t want to discourage you from  <br/>\ndoing them! If they had fun, that&#39;s what counts :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to encourage you to expand your offerings. See the world  <br/>\nthrough kids eyes in addition to the &quot;good for them&quot; stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m a little uncomfortable with it because she is not getting a lot  <br/>\n&gt; of exercise because of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And you&#39;d probably have an even harder time if it was a show she loved  <br/>\nthat you didn&#39;t! At least your daughter&#39;s helping you ease into this :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than thinking in terms of taking away, think in terms of adding  <br/>\nto her life. Kids don&#39;t get much exercise from reading books but few  <br/>\nparents demonize books because of that. Some activities are more head  <br/>\noriented. (Though you can get a mini trampoline for in front of the TV  <br/>\nif you&#39;ve got kids who like to move around while they watch :-) Some  <br/>\nactivities are more body oriented. Neither is bad because they&#39;re not  <br/>\nthe other. Add some park days and trips to climb rocks and swim and so  <br/>\non to their lives. Not instead of TV. In addition to TV.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, how can I present some fun math stuff to her? A couple of  <br/>\n&gt; months ago, she was playing around with some of the math on  <br/>\n&gt; starfall.com (they have interactive math games) but she is really  <br/>\n&gt; into liberty&#39;s kids right now, not math.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And maybe she always will be more drawn to language than numbers.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe aware of the numbers in her life that are already there. Weigh  <br/>\nthings at the supermarket. Ask her to see how close she can get to  <br/>\nexactly 2 pounds of apples. Put their heights on the wall. Give her an  <br/>\nallowance. Do this for real, not as lessons.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter learned most of her math from video games. Games use  <br/>\nnumbers for real, important (to the game) reasons. And kids *want* to  <br/>\npull more information from the games in order to get better at them.  <br/>\nThe numbers aren&#39;t there to make kids figure them out as they are in  <br/>\neducational math games. The numbers exist for real purposes to show  <br/>\nrelative strengths, to show how much power is left, to keep score, to  <br/>\nkeep track. There are maps. There are graphs. Real purposes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s quite a bit to read about real math and the poor substitute  <br/>\nthat school math is down the left sidebar under Math at:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joyfullyrejoycing.com\">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, my almost five year old son doesn&#39;t really want to watch  <br/>\n&gt; liberty&#39;s kids, but he also wants to be in front of the screen. This  <br/>\n&gt; leads to him getting bored, and being annoying, (making noises so  <br/>\n&gt; she can&#39;t hear, spinning his chair so it hits hers, on accident,  <br/>\n&gt; etc, etc. etc. ) I got him some crafts from Michael&#39;s, which he  <br/>\n&gt; really likes. He can do some of those in front of the screen, but  <br/>\n&gt; that is going to run out soon. He won&#39;t do anything I suggest  <br/>\n&gt; (color, draw, listen to a story in the other room, anything, ) so  <br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s a bit difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It wouldn&#39;t be difficult if he had another TV to watch.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s not trying to make your life more difficult. He&#39;s trying to meet  <br/>\na need. The way he&#39;s trying to meet it isn&#39;t the best! It&#39;s annoying  <br/>\nand isn&#39;t getting him what he needs anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelp him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will also help not to see unschooling as about finding ways to  <br/>\noccupy them. It&#39;s about helping them explore. Sometimes that will  <br/>\ninvolve you fully. Sometimes they&#39;ll need you to back off.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re moving and need to be doing things to get ready, perhaps  <br/>\nfinding a homeschooled teen to come be with them will help. But do see  <br/>\nyour unschooling role as being whatever they need you to be in their  <br/>\nquest for learning. Your goal isn&#39;t to get them set up so they can  <br/>\nlearn on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying you&#39;re doing that all the time, or that&#39;s your whole  <br/>\nfocus. But that view is in what you wrote and is probably coloring the  <br/>\nway you&#39;re approaching helping them learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I also have an almost 10 month old baby who is not supposed to watch  <br/>\n&gt; screens (the board of pediatricians says babies shouldn&#39;t watch  <br/>\n&gt; until age 2),<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t put much credence into what they say. They really don&#39;t  <br/>\nknow. You don&#39;t know what the studies are, or why they were done, or  <br/>\nwho paid for them that has made the pediatrics association release  <br/>\nthat blanket statement.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetter far than an anonymous herd of pediatricians who&#39;ve never met  <br/>\nyour unique child is your child.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost 10 mos aren&#39;t interested in TV!

Watching the other kids,  <br/>\nyou, touching, listening, moving are all activities that a 10 mo is  <br/>\nlikely to find more interesting than TV. If he loves the backpack,  <br/>\nthat&#39;s the best place for him. It&#39;s a great solution. He gets to be  <br/>\nwith the toy that&#39;s best for babies: their moms. He gets to see what&#39;s  <br/>\ngoing on in the world while you&#39;re doing real things.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it needs to be most of the day, let it be most of the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps sanity greatly to let go of how you expect life to be.

They didn&#39;t sign up for  <br/>\nthis gig ;-) They were dragged into the world because you choose to do  <br/>\nthat to them.

We have done various stages of unschooling.  It has been a long process for me to deschool myself.  My daughter has always been at home.  When she was younger, I definitely tried the school at home approach, and it really made her hate schoolwork.  <br/>\nFast forward to now.  My husband and I are still slightly tentative with this approach, and worried that she won&#39;t learn how to do arithmetic.  I really tried to spend 15 minutes a day of phonics to help her learn to read when she was younger.  It didn&#39;t do anything except make her want to avoid me.  I didn&#39;t want to sacrifice my relationship with her to the altar of education, so I let go of it for about six months, and she is now reading level 1 books. Yay!  I started letting her watch Angelina Ballerina, (I only let her watch documentaries before),  and then to encourage the reading, I got her the books that went with it (which I wouldn&#39;t have done before, because I don&#39;t like how companies prey on children with attractive marketing).  She likes the books, and laughs over them, which makes me happy, because she is happy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe loves audio books, and has listened to the unabridged versions of Little Women, Anne of Green Gables, Little Princess, Secret Garden, the Little House on the Prairie series, and Misty of Chincoteague. She listened to Little Women for about 5-6 months straight.  I tried to extend her learning by doing projects related to the stuff she was listening to:  we made a telegraph machine, I took her to places civil war related, she planted a garden, she acted out many scenes with her brother, I took them horse back riding, etc.   <br/>\n<br/>\nRight now she is really into Liberty&#39;s Kids, a PBS animated series that dramatizes the times from the Boston Tea Party to the signing of the Declaration of Independence. She has watched the entire series (40 episodes, 30 minutes each) three times.  I&#39;m not used to letting her watch videos so much. I&#39;m a little uncomfortable with it because she is not getting a lot of exercise because of it.  I know she is really enjoying it, and that she is busy assimilating the information, but I still worry.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, I&#39;m glad that she likes it because we are in the process of moving, so it is helpful, plus it is hot and muggy here. Who wants to be outside anyway?  Is watching this much tv harmful though?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, how can I present some fun math stuff to her?  A couple of months ago, she was playing around with some of the math on starfall.com (they have interactive math games) but she is really into liberty&#39;s kids right now, not math.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, my almost five year old son doesn&#39;t really want to watch liberty&#39;s kids, but he also wants to be in front of the screen.  This leads to him getting bored, and being annoying, (making noises so she can&#39;t hear, spinning his chair so it hits hers, on accident,  etc, etc. etc. )  I got him some crafts from Michael&#39;s, which he really likes.  He can do some of those in front of the screen, but that is going to run out soon.  He won&#39;t do anything I suggest (color, draw, listen to a story in the other room, anything, ) so it&#39;s a bit difficult.  I also have an almost 10 month old baby who is not supposed to watch screens (the board of pediatricians says babies shouldn&#39;t watch until age 2), so I have to monitor him, and it usually ends with me wearing him in the backpack ALL THE TIME. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn our old house, she was always upstairs (which I felt was too isolating for her) while I was downstairs always interacting with the four year old.  I felt like she was missing out on all the fun we were having, and possibly getting neurotic about things.  I had her signed up for a sport every day of the week, so I felt like she was at least visiting with her sporty friends, and getting exercise.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn our new house, we all are basically hanging out in the kitchen. I feel like that is good for her (less isolating), but also can be difficult sometimes, logistically.  I set up two computers on the sideboard to create a computer lab type atmosphere for the kids, but one of the computers is not currently linked to the internet (which means four year old can&#39;t do starfall.com (his favorite).  <br/>\n<br/>\nDo people think that it&#39;s too much screen time for the kids?  <br/>\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for the almost five year old who wants to be in front of screen, but is bored?  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, <br/>\nKim</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":61600,"nextTopicId":61578}}
