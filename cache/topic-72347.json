If I don&#39;t eat beef for long periods of time I literally start feeling ill. If I drink caffeinated beverages my throat will hurt. If I eat soy and too much gluten, I gain weight. Meat seams to work best for my body as well as a lot of green veggies (not raw, but cooked). My son feels sick when he eats meat everyday. His lips tingle and get swollen when he eats certain fruits and when he&#39;s sick he finds avoiding corn, soy and wheat help his immune system, get its healing done faster. Amazingly enough, we took him for allergy testing after several bouts of hives and grains where one of the things that showed he had a slight intolerance to. But we already knew that because we listened to his body. The kids can eat candy and feel great, I eat candy (sugary things) and I tend to not feel well. Except chocolate. I don&#39;t care how sick I get!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with other things in life. I get on a swing and I&#39;m going to barf. The kids can swing to the moon and back and have wonderful fun!!  I&#39;m good at pushing them on the swings and pretending to be their rocket power.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe explaining things like this to your little one might help. We all have different needs and desires. I realize that hers seem to me to be more of an ethical/humane one, but other discussions might come up now or later that might be good for you to store away.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Jen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":124256069,"authorName":"","from":"&lt;alohabun@...&gt;","profile":"alohabun","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: Choosing not to eat chicken and asking us to do the same","postDate":"1381807865","msgId":72360,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGwzaWN0cCsxYW0ya3NuQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBTExDdytNSFBLQWprZ3IrLWhzOXlOU28yUHhjYStuUG1DTmtfNEZkc0h1VWNDWk9NZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBTExDdytNSFBLQWprZ3IrLWhzOXlOU28yUHhjYStuUG1DTmtfNEZkc0h1VWNDWk9NZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":72356,"nextInTopic":72364,"prevInTime":72359,"nextInTime":72361,"topicId":72347,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My son Li (12) doesn t eat meat and avoids cheese with animal rennet.
