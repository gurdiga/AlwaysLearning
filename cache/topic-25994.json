American psychologist speaking in Australia  <br/>\ngiving British examples:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Professor Garbarino told a parenting conference this week in  <br/>\nAdelaide that research dating back 40 years had proved a link between  <br/>\nchild exposure to TV violence and increased physical aggression. But  <br/>\nwhile girls were initially found to be &quot;immune&quot; to the &quot;contagious&quot;  <br/>\neffect of TV violence, researchers had seen a significant shift since  <br/>\nthe 1980s. &quot;That immunity had disappeared,&quot; he said.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n================<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n40 years.  HMMMMM.... What else has happened in the past 40 years?   <br/>\nCompulsory education, up to the late teens.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think that&#39;s being looked at by ANYone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA few weeks ago on the local news here (Albuquerque), a spokesman for  <br/>\nthe Albuquerque Public schools was saying yes, there was a lot of  <br/>\ngraffiti at the schools lately, but there was also more in the city  <br/>\nitself, and teens were emulating the adult behavior they saw outside  <br/>\nof school.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWHAT!?  #1, who says the graffiti in the public non-school places  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t also done by kids?  And if those kids had real jobs instead of  <br/>\nbeing made to do homework and go to sleep early so they could go to  <br/>\nschool by government edict again in the morning, they might be too  <br/>\nbusy or satisfied to want to steal spray paint and mess something up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe quote at the top was from here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dailytelegraph.news.com.au/story/0,20281,19264916-5001022,00.html\">http://dailytelegraph.news.com.au/story/0,20281,19264916-5001022,00.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25984,"nextTopicId":25993}}
