I <br/>\ndon&#39;t care if anyone sleeps on the floor.  It&#39;s hard to lug a 65 lb. 8 <br/>\nyo to bed, anyway.  There&#39;s no way I&#39;d wake a kid up so he can brush his <br/>\nteeth!  He can brush his teeth right after dinner, if it&#39;s that important.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I&#39;ve noticed when some people complain about kids not going to <br/>\nsleep early enough--their houses are blazing with lights on, there&#39;s <br/>\nactivity and noise, and the atmosphere is not conducive to sleep.  If <br/>\nyou want your little ones to get sleepy, do things that bring on rest <br/>\nand comfort.  Turn off all of the lights in the rest of the house, turn <br/>\ndown the lights in the room they&#39;re in, turn off the stereo or the TV, <br/>\nkeep your conversation quiet.  Curl up on the couch with a good <br/>\nbook--whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve found that even if a kid feels like staying awake after all that, <br/>\ntheir activity level is much diminished, and I can go to sleep in peace, <br/>\nknowing the house is locked up and squared away for the night, except <br/>\nfor the room he is in.  I can give last minute instructions (&quot;please set <br/>\nthe sleep timer on your TV before you go to sleep&quot;) and go to bed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m always really quiet when I get up, too.  It&#39;s such a gift to wake up <br/>\nnaturally (poor husband doesn&#39;t get to) and according to your own <br/>\nrhythm.  I&#39;m trying to teach my son to listen to his rhythms of <br/>\nsleep/wake, hungry/full.  I want that to last for him as long as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nTuck</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8664,"nextTopicId":8639}}
