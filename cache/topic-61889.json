Noor saw a few bits on YouTube, I think Star Wars parodies, and wanted to watch more.  I remember watching the first few episodes with her and cringing at the thought of what other parents would think if they knew I let her watch it.  It was especially difficult to think what my *own* parents would think--and we live with my dad and step-mom.  She laughed SO hard watching it; she enjoyed it SO much, that I found the experience immensely pleasurable and was able to connect to how *I* felt sneaky letting her watch and how terrible that felt--to enjoy something that others would disapprove of.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat Michael and I have done with programs that have serious adult content is ask that Noor watch them with us, that way we know exactly what she&#39;s being exposed to and we can answer questions without having to grasp for the origin.  It also helps us offer explanations that are simple and suitable for her level of understanding (instead of freaking out that she knows the word &quot;Pervert,&quot; for example).<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the most surprising benefits of watching things like &quot;Family Guy&quot; with Noor is that I have allayed many of the original fears I had about mainstream TV/Video/Film from my early years as an unschooler. I was trained (I use that word intentionally) as a feminist visual theorist, and that training fueled my early resistance to free media access to young children--I was afraid that all the &quot;sexist, classist, racist narratives&quot; would color her view of the world and of herself (mind, I was worried about all this when she was just 3!!).  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome very helpful mommas pointed out that my worries were unfounded, that I was taking studies based on schooled youth and my own experiences with schooled college students as the only possible outcome, but unschooling families have different experiences! Why? Because parents are *involved* in what their children watch/read/hear--they share the experience and thus share many meaningful conversations about all the topics that had me so worried.<br/>\n<br/>\nNoor has a greater awareness about race, class, culture and gender issues than many college age students I&#39;ve met.

Most parents would  <br/>\ntake away what their child was doing because the reaction &quot;proved&quot; the  <br/>\nchild wasn&#39;t able to handle it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it happens to adults all the time. And other adults -- adults with  <br/>\nany social sense -- will avoid them until they&#39;ve worked off their  <br/>\nirritation, or do something nice for them that they feel might help  <br/>\nease the irritation. And most adults have learned to pick up the clues  <br/>\nthat they&#39;re getting antsy and have developed strategies to take  <br/>\nbreaks or whatever. It&#39;s tempting to want to make her take a break but  <br/>\nthere are much more relationship building ways to help someone grow in  <br/>\nawareness and explore options. (Ask here if you think this might be  <br/>\nthe case.) The worse way is to insist you&#39;re right in your  <br/>\nobservations and impose your way of fixing the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My heart is<br/>\n&gt; reeling from this exchange, I want to do my job as a parent by  <br/>\n&gt; keeping her safe<br/>\n&gt; online.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But what you describe is a child who was sensitive and reacted  <br/>\nstrongly. Are you saying the &quot;unsafeness&quot; of the internet has caused  <br/>\nher to be irritable?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you&#39;re making connections between things you don&#39;t like and  <br/>\nlumping them all together into a confusion that&#39;s muddling your  <br/>\nthinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nIrritability can come from intense concentration on anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she feels empowered, she doesn&#39;t need to read comments that will  <br/>\nupset her. If she feels her power will be taken away, she may want to  <br/>\ncram in as much as she can.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe may be seeing things *you* don&#39;t think a child should. But her own  <br/>\ninternal like/don&#39;t like meter is a better judge than you are of what  <br/>\nshe likes and doesn&#39;t like. She *will* push the limits of her meter,  <br/>\nexploring her own boundaries of what she likes and doesn&#39;t like and  <br/>\nwhy -- which keep changing as she&#39;s growing older so it&#39;s not a one  <br/>\ntime thing but ongoing.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can interfere with her growing understanding of what she likes and  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like by implying that her meter doesn&#39;t work and yours is  <br/>\nbetter. This is where many many parents go wrong. They see their kids  <br/>\nmaking choices they wouldn&#39;t, they see their kids exploring their  <br/>\nboundaries and assume their kids judgment is faulty and the parents  <br/>\nneed to take over. But to grow judgment kids need to explore it, not  <br/>\nhave someone else&#39;s imposed on them. By the time they&#39;re teens, kids  <br/>\nhave the power to stand up to parents&#39; imposition but they lack the  <br/>\nexperience with exploring their own judgement. And where their  <br/>\njudgement is saying their parents ideas are right, they become  <br/>\nreactionary and want to do the opposite.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she&#39;s seeing things *she* doesn&#39;t want to see, you can explore with  <br/>\nher various filters. Help her find what *she* wants to see and avoid  <br/>\nwhat *she* doesn&#39;t want to see.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re curious about what she thinks about the crude comments, ask  <br/>\nher at some other time. And *listen* to what she says with an open  <br/>\nmind. Don&#39;t listen with an ear tuned to your ideas of what she should  <br/>\nbe thinking or should not be thinking. Listen to *her* ideas. Don&#39;t  <br/>\nimpose your &quot;right&quot; way of thinking on her. Don&#39;t lead her to your  <br/>\n&quot;right&quot; way of viewing the world. Listen to her growing understanding.  <br/>\nTrust that she&#39;s a thinking being and her ideas will change as she  <br/>\ngains experience with the world. Trust she&#39;ll value kindness if who  <br/>\nshe is is treated with respect and kindness. Trust that she&#39;ll want to  <br/>\nstep on your ideas if you show her that&#39;s what you do with people who  <br/>\ndon&#39;t have the same ideas as you do.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] mums and computers and...","postDate":"1311329514","msgId":61907,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMTEzMjk1MTQuNzMwMzguWWFob29NYWlsUkNAd2ViODczMDgubWFpbC5pcmQueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMTEyOTU4MzMuODYyMjcuWWFob29NYWlsUkNAd2ViMTE0NjAyLm1haWwuZ3ExLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDEzMTEyOTU4MzMuODYyMjcuWWFob29NYWlsUkNAd2ViMTE0NjAyLm1haWwuZ3ExLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":61904,"nextInTopic":61917,"prevInTime":61906,"nextInTime":61908,"topicId":61889,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There are a lot of innapropriate images in the world.
