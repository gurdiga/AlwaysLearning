I&#39;m thinking yes...<br/>\n<br/>\nMany stories on my mom&#39;s side of the family involve death and prison  <br/>\nand guns and jumping freight trains and all manner of  yuckiness.   <br/>\nExcept one brother of hers who was not like that at all, never was,  <br/>\nhis kids turned out great, his wife is still with him after 60 years  <br/>\nor so, and he stayed in contact with the others, too, but he was never  <br/>\nan alcoholic lunatic.    It was easy for me to look at that and think  <br/>\nto be more like Uncle Junior and Aunt Mona than like the Joe Paul and  <br/>\nBilly Jack and Doris Mae subsets of that family.  Eeeeek...  My mom  <br/>\nwas Mary Lou.  For sure they had those kinds of names.  Uncle Joe  <br/>\nPaul&#39;s oldest was named Paula Jo.  I have no idea what became of her.   <br/>\nHer parents divorced when we were still really little.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents moved away from relatives when I was six, and that made my  <br/>\nlife MUCH better.  My dad was never a drinker, nor his family either.   <br/>\nHe met my mom from being Junior&#39;s best friend.  Junior and my dad  <br/>\ndrank when they were &quot;kids&quot; (21, 22 or however old when they were  <br/>\nhanging out), and when they got married they were responsible,  <br/>\nhardworking dads.  My mom stayed away from alcohol unless she was  <br/>\nvisiting her family or had drinking guests, when I was younger.  It  <br/>\nstarted creeping back upon her and she let it flow, and so it got  <br/>\nworse during my &quot;tweens&quot; and by the time I was in mid teens she was a  <br/>\nloathesome drunk.

They were not misbehaving so I am not sure why she said that. I told her &quot;Oh Auntie every morning I give them a spankin for anything they may do during the day.&quot; Then she said &quot;oh no don&#39;t do that.&quot; She raised two amazing boys. Her son told me later that day that what she said was funny because she never &quot;disciplined&quot; them. Now my two sons are wonderful teens who I love to be around so I feel like I am doing something right. <br/>\n<br/>\nI had another &quot;Aunt&quot; who was really my moms best friend who loved to tell me all I was doing wrong with my kids. She spanked. punished and constantly pushed her kids. One was killed as a teen in a drug deal gone bad and I was a mean drunk.
