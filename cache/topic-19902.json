It is<br/>\nfrustrating and I find myself distancing myself from them simply because<br/>\nthey do not get it! They do not understand that everything in their lives is<br/>\na choice, including as someone wrote, how they choose to feel and how they<br/>\nchoose to interrelate with myself and others.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI so wish to be close to these two people in my life, but their negativity<br/>\nand emotional and energy draining behaviors are making it next to impossible<br/>\n I know this is there choice, but I am not sure what my choices should be?<br/>\nDo I keep trying to brainstorm with them in an attempt to &quot;convert&quot; them<br/>\nover to choice and freedom? Or do I make the choice to give up these<br/>\nrelationships?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOr are there other choices out there I may not be seeing?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAny words of direction, would be of great help here! :)\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThanks for this thread Sandra, it has been a great source of inspiration for<br/>\nme! :) I am thoroughly enjoying reading all of the perspectives on this! It<br/>\nis so ironically funny to me how anytime thee is something that I am<br/>\ngrappling with in my life or the kids are in their lives or just something<br/>\nthat is a matter of interest to me or my kids (i.e. when my middle son was<br/>\ntaking interest in the guitar, or egg hatching etc.) somehow, the same exact<br/>\nthing that comes up in our lives here seems to pop up as a thread on one of<br/>\nthe many yahoo groups I am on! :)\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSo thank you Sandra and everyone! :)\r<br/>\nPatti and the boys (Chris 13, Matthew 7, Anthony 6)\r<br/>\nLife Long Learning Academy\r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.life-long-learning-4-all.com/index.html\">http://www.life-long-learning-4-all.com/index.html</a>\r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Inclusivity/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Inclusivity/</a>\r<br/>\n&quot;For no matter where knowledge and learning come from - no matter\r<br/>\nwhat shape, size, or dimension it assumes - it still is what it is,\r<br/>\nknowledge and learning.
