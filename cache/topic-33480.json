They are  now 15 <br/>\nand 18.  My oldest daughter went to 4 camp sessions on the east  coast.  She&#39;ll <br/>\nbe in college this year but my son plans on attending the  session in Vermont <br/>\nin September.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy daughter would be very happy to share some of her experiences at camp if  <br/>\nyou would like to write to me off-list.  From listening to the stories they  <br/>\nhave told after coming home from camp, the first words that come to mind are  <br/>\nempowering and life-changing.
