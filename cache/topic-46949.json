Doing this with the power out, and in a way that doesn&#39;t target the child you&#39;re seeing as the prime offender, might yield surprises.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also might help *you* to shift your thinking.  Your posts have a hint of futility and defensiveness in them that I&#39;ve felt at times, too.  What I&#39;ve learned is that what seems insurmountable and impossible to bear becomes almost laughable if I only shift my attitude.  The attitude shift will lead to a new or different action if you let it.  Maybe it&#39;ll be one of the suggestions posted here, or something that pops into your head in an unexpected moment.  But if you&#39;re open for it, focused on changing *your* thinking rather than *his* habit, you might find that this mountain quickly and effortlessly becomes a molehill.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I feel this hopelessness, I can always count on the very experienced voices on this list, and in the chats, to jolt me out of my unexamined thinking.  I may not always like being called on m assumptions here, at first (I&#39;m inordinately attached to my schooly beliefs, at times), but I always end up turning things over and over in my mind, worrying at them until they evolve into ideas I can use here, right now, in *my* way of being my own family.

And I&#39;m NOT okay with that.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have similar issues here - Jayn wanted to take one of her long playing <br/>\ntype of showers and run the big heating light in the bathroom. It especially <br/>\nbothers her father to see her being so oblivious to ecological issues and <br/>\nour utility bills. However she heard his suggestions to get out as nagging, <br/>\n(and tbh he did sound pretty cranky). She can&#39;t bear to feel &quot;in the wrong&quot; <br/>\nand instantly became defensive. He wanted me to step in and fix his problem. <br/>\nThe real disagreement here was between James and I - over how long is too <br/>\nlong in the shower, and is it worth the fight. I tend to lean on the side of <br/>\n&quot;not&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn is very aware of other eco-issues, like picking up litter, recycling <br/>\nand using cloth shopping bags. I think her awareness and what might be <br/>\ncalled &quot;empathy for the earth&quot; comes in waves. Finding information on line, <br/>\nor watching science programs seems to allow Jay to absorb the information <br/>\n(and then want talk about it) much more readily than when it comes initially <br/>\nfrom me or James. In our subsequent discussion about it (ie James and my <br/>\ndiscussion) he asked me to find a way to show Jayn why her excessive water <br/>\nuse is a problem, help her become aware of the drought in CA, and we talked <br/>\nabout tv and the internet being the best source for this, rather than him <br/>\ntelling her to get out of the shower. I asked him to practice some more <br/>\npatience. So we are back on the same page again.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my answers is to take up as much of the slack as I can manage. I make <br/>\nsure I am turning off as much as I can. I take short showers (which is also <br/>\nmodelling). Of course every light bulb in our house is a compact <br/>\nfluorescent, as I am sure is the case in Adesa&#39;s home. I can&#39;t &quot;make her&quot; <br/>\ntake responsibility. I can only allow her to when she is ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a blackout late last night for about three hours - a blown <br/>\ntransformer apparently. It was interesting to talk about &quot;the olden days&quot; of <br/>\nworking by candlelight. The only problem with an all electric kitchen is our <br/>\ninability to cook. The blackout happened just as Jayn had said that she was <br/>\nhungry! I made tuna salad on crackers, the first time she had eaten that, <br/>\nand it was fun. Even a few hours made us appreciate how much electricity we <br/>\nuse and how much we depend upon power. It was all rather magical timing.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
