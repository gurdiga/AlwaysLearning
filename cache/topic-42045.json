Less scary.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it gets less and less scary sounding as time goes by.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was a sophomore, I dated a boy who had been a friend of my older<br/>\nsister&#39;s and who was a senior when I was a freshman. (so he was one year out<br/>\nof school and we had worked together when we dated)  The year he got out of<br/>\nhigh school, he moved into a house with three other young people.  They all<br/>\nhad jobs and were responsible in that way, but all of them partied hard on<br/>\nthe week-ends.  It became the place to hang out for some of us. (even after<br/>\nI broke up with the boyfriend..we were still friends)  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the room-mates was older (25), though he didn&#39;t look or act any<br/>\ndifferent than the rest of the group.  I expressed an interest in him before<br/>\nhe did me.  Then I found out he was 25.  It made no difference to me.  I<br/>\nliked him.  He didn&#39;t seem any different to me than the other boys. (well,<br/>\nhe might have seemed a little more responsible and ready to settle down) In<br/>\ntime, we became a thing.  I didn&#39;t tell my parent&#39;s how old he was.  I<br/>\ndodged the question.  They liked him.  They imagined he was younger than he<br/>\nwas.  He looked young.  He spent a lot of time at our house.  My mother fed<br/>\nhim well. =)  There were six kids in our family and someone was always<br/>\nbringing someone home anyway.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I graduated from high school we went to the same college.  After the<br/>\nfirst year I married him thinking that my mother would kill me if I just<br/>\nmoved in with him.  (later on my sister did just that and she didn&#39;t get<br/>\nkilled so I guess I could have waited)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been 25 years since I met that bad boy who dated the younger girl.  We<br/>\nhave 2 great kids who are now 12 and 14.  We live together pretty easily.<br/>\nHe&#39;s definitely less energetic than I but that is more a personality thing<br/>\nthan an age thing.  It&#39;s always been that way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt still freaks me out on some level when I hear of someone dating someone<br/>\nwith a huge age difference because our culture flinches at that.  I always<br/>\nhave to stop and reflect about it and not just react and then I&#39;m always<br/>\nokay with it.  I have never felt like I was a different age than my hubby<br/>\nexcept when we compare the cultures of our childhood&#39;s.

It was made with typing  <br/>\npaper, construction paper hearts, and had bits glued on inside, with  <br/>\nfancy art and cut-out XOXO glued onto a crayon-pattern background.   <br/>\nSounds tacky, but looked beautiful.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly had written on white paper and glued over the design:<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are a glorious friend<br/>\nand an amazing human<br/>\nand the love of my life.<br/>\n<br/>\nNice writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nGranted, her life is young and he&#39;s the first love, but they do seem  <br/>\nto treat each other very sweetly and well and this could be it.  Maybe  <br/>\nnot, but if it is, they&#39;re getting a good early start.  On the 21st it  <br/>\nwill have been a year since their first kiss.  She was sixteen and he  <br/>\nwas twenty-three.   It scared people, just the age gap and the idea of  <br/>\nit.  Now she&#39;s seventeen and he&#39;s twenty-four.  Less scary.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never minded Kirby having older friends.  He has had since La Leche  <br/>\nLeague days.  Later, gaming shop and karate.  It was good for him to  <br/>\nhave rides, before he could drive, and people who would take him to  <br/>\ngaming tournaments and anime conventions.<br/>\nI totally understood Marty having older friends---many of Kirby&#39;s age  <br/>\nand older.<br/>\nI used to joke (not really a joke) that a guy was going to have to  <br/>\npretty impressive to get Holly&#39;s attention, because she had seen her  <br/>\nbrothers and all her friends up close through all their pubescent  <br/>\nirritating phases.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was still a little surprised that it was one of Kirby&#39;s friends she  <br/>\ndid choose to &quot;wait for.&quot;  She let him know she liked him, and when  <br/>\nshe was old enough for him to begin to consider, she reminded him  <br/>\nagain. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s *so different* from what would have happened if she were in  <br/>\nschool.  When she first knew him she would&#39;ve been in 9th grade and he  <br/>\nwas in grad school.  A year ago, she would&#39;ve been a high school  <br/>\njunior and he was a grad school drop-out.  (He might go back; he might  <br/>\nnot.)  Knowing her as well as we do, and with her sharing all this  <br/>\nwith us as it slowly developed, how could we possibly think she didn&#39;t  <br/>\nknow what she was doing, or was being impetuous?  It was open and  <br/>\nhonest and aboveboard.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey used to play Halo 3 together late at night, so they could talk,  <br/>\nbefore there was any romance in the air but she thought he was the  <br/>\nbest of the guys in their extended social group.  That&#39;s quite a safe  <br/>\nactivity, she in her house on the XBox and he at his house.  The first  <br/>\ntime they were alone together, he took her to McDonald&#39;s.  Then they  <br/>\nsat on the swings at a school playground, and came back before dark.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis friends have been more critical than anyone else, but most of them  <br/>\nhave calmed themselves about it, especially as months have passed and  <br/>\nnone of their fears materialized (whatever their fears were).   I&#39;ve  <br/>\nheard that his parents hate the idea of unschooling.   His dad is a  <br/>\ndoctor and his mom is a PhD Geneticist at the university; they&#39;ve been  <br/>\ndivorced since he was six.  I haven&#39;t met his dad.  His mom is really  <br/>\nnice to Holly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t what people might have predicted, but it&#39;s very civilized  <br/>\nand rarely in this century has a young man been so thoroughly vetted  <br/>\nby the girl&#39;s family. &lt;bwg&gt;  Brett has been coming over here for a few  <br/>\nyears to hang out with Kirby, and he has come to two of my birthday  <br/>\nparties (to play Encore; he sings).  I&#39;ve been at karaoke where he was  <br/>\na few times, before there was any Holly interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t talk about this relationship a whole lot when it was new, not  <br/>\nonline like this. It wasn&#39;t secret, but I was afraid it might make new  <br/>\nunschoolers uncomfortable.   A year is a stable amount of time,  <br/>\nthough, and Holly will be 18 later this year.  Kirby was a groomsman  <br/>\nin a fancy wedding at Bishop&#39;s Lodge a few years back; that wedding  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t last as long as this has.   So it&#39;s past being a crush or an  <br/>\naberration.
