Can you move in  with <br/>\nanother unschooling family or maybe another single mom?<br/>\n <br/>\nMy kids were also 7 and 4 when I became a single parent.  My sister  cared <br/>\nfor them and I bought a house next door to her.  I had to work  full-time the <br/>\nfirst year and then part-time for the next couple of years but was  always able <br/>\nto keep them either with me or next door with my sister.  They  are now 16 and <br/>\n12 and I&#39;ve been remarried for several years.  <br/>\n <br/>\nOther possibilities I thought of were to find a college student who needed  a <br/>\nplace to live and work hours when they were available to take care of your  <br/>\nkids.  I moved across the country in order to live by my sister and I  thought <br/>\nit was the best decision I could have made considering the  circumstances at <br/>\nthe time. <br/>\n <br/>\nNot sure of your situation but if you are in a relationship with their  <br/>\nfather, I&#39;d exhaust every avenue including therapy and even sharing a house as  <br/>\nfriends before I&#39;d consider leaving.  I could have done that but didn&#39;t  even <br/>\nconsider it as an option at the time.  I guess I&#39;d just suggest that  you be very <br/>\ncreative and open to all possibilities. <br/>\n <br/>\nGail<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":230812300,"authorName":"myzandh","from":"&quot;myzandh&quot; &lt;nahoagland@...&gt;","profile":"myzandh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Going it alone","postDate":"1140825968","msgId":24600,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGR0bzcxZytsYTRyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":24607,"prevInTime":24599,"nextInTime":24601,"topicId":24600,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Does anyone have any tips on unschooling/homeschooling as a single parent?
