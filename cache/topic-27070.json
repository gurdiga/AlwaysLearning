Maybe it&#39;s a person and  <br/>\nmaybe it&#39;s a &quot;pick two nouns&quot; program, but if any of you get e-mail  <br/>\nspam about penny stocks and such, you&#39;ve seen them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis one came from Sadie Mendoza in Germany.  I like that all by  <br/>\nitself.   But the weird subject to pass spam catchers was...<br/>\n<br/>\n\tFrom: \t  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nqcddq@...\">nqcddq@...</a><br/>\n\tSubject: \tChrist transistor<br/>\n\tDate: \tSeptember 28, 2006 2:08:17 AM M<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I&#39;d like to list that as my religion or maybe as my  <br/>\noccupation from time to time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s what priests do.  We heard a really brilliant priest at a  <br/>\nwedding we attended in Southern New Mexico the other day.  He was  <br/>\nsaying wonderful things I had never heard.   But his job and his  <br/>\nreligion both are transforming God into a flow that others can  <br/>\nperceive and accept.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe we could consider adopting the term  &quot;transistor&quot; as an  <br/>\nadjective for homeschooling, instead of clinging to &quot;unschooling&quot;  <br/>\nwhich confuses everyone who never heard the &quot;un Cola&quot; commercials of  <br/>\nthe 1970&#39;s, and causes arguments in France.   Could we think of  <br/>\nourselves as homeschool transistors?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who read it (or think of) &quot;REsistors,&quot; we would be that, to  <br/>\nthem, anyway.<br/>\nAnd for people who might say resistors only make a flow smaller, we  <br/>\ncould say &quot;If you go to Google and put in &#39;Can transistors amplify?&#39;  <br/>\nyou can read all about it.&quot;   That will be a good intro to google if  <br/>\nthey don&#39;t already use it.<br/>\nOr we could follow with any of these amendments, to help their thinking:<br/>\n  &quot;Okay, we&#39;re homeschool  inductors&quot; or  &quot;Homeschool amplifiers&quot; or  <br/>\n&quot;homeschool op amps&quot; (Homeschool Boosters sounds so 1962/bakesale).<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Homeschool transformers&quot;<br/>\nYES!!   *Robots in disguise*!<br/>\n      Transfomers, more than meets the eye--<br/>\n      Transformers, robots in disguise.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut maybe the old Transformers cartoon theme song would be as lost on  <br/>\nyounger moms as the &quot;uncola&quot; reference in &quot;unschooling.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we think of our job as moms as helping transform the world into a  <br/>\nflow that others can perceive and accept, what could be better?<br/>\nAnd isn&#39;t learning itself taking information and transforming it into  <br/>\nbits that can be absorbed by our system (our minds, memory and  <br/>\nunderstanding?)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd quite simply, not everyone has the capacity to do this.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27069,"nextTopicId":27068}}
