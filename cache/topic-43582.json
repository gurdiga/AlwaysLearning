I didn&#39;t have a religious upbringing at all, never went to church or started seeking spiritually until my late 20&#39;s (over 15 years ago). So my spiritual beliefs were sought out on my own as an adult.  I didn&#39;t really have a basis or pre-conceived religious ideas, for where to start -- so I searched through many, many different paths over the years.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was rarely, if at all, punished growing up and never received a spanking.  My sisters, on the other hand, did receive punishment in anger (as opposed to loving direction when needed -- which, by the way, I didn&#39;t receive either), and I can see the fear behind the heavy walls.  I have fears too, of course, to a varying degree, but it&#39;s getting much better.  I do believe that anger is one of the worst enemies, especially when directed toward a child.  It can wear many masks. I have struggled with that, wearing the mask of frustration and impatience, and am working on this character defect.  I believe that a lack of love and humility (selfishness) also breeds anger or frustration, to the person being selfish, I mean, in that his expected desires are not satisfied.  We know how that spills over onto the children.  (I read a saying in a fiction book once that said, &quot;We teach best what we most need to learn!&quot;)  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I would respectfully question, though, is do you not think children should be responsible?  Can we/should we raise responsible children, through example, and other avenues besides manipulation, punishment and control?  (Any tips on this would be greatly appreciated!)

I&#39;m always impressed with people who are willing <br/>\ncarry their beliefs to their logical conclusions.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo not think of your own childhood as having anything at all to do with <br/>\nunschooling. Sounds like the opposite. Unschooling requires tremendous <br/>\namounts of parental involvement. Without that, it really is not <br/>\nunschooling. Thinking of your own childhood as having any kind of <br/>\nunschooling nature will hold you back in getting to a strong <br/>\nunderstanding of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re craving structure and control, I have a couple of suggestions <br/>\nfor you, to help you get over that &lt;G&gt;.  First, keep a journal or <br/>\nprivate blog in which you write your own observations about your <br/>\nchildren. Make it only for your own eyes, so that you don&#39;t have to put <br/>\nany kind of public face on it. Observe what lights up your child&#39;s eyes. <br/>\nObserve what seemed to frustrate him/her. Take note of how he goes about <br/>\ngetting what he wants. Look at how they interact with each other. Etc. <br/>\nThink of this as being a scientist, out in the field, observing these <br/>\nyoung creatures in their natural environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, try to support them in living as natural a life as <br/>\npossible, for them. If you are observing that running and jumping seems <br/>\nto be what they want - find ways to support running and jumping. When <br/>\nyou&#39;re writing in your journal on blog, jot down ideas of how you could <br/>\nsupport their natural inclinations.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might also need to consider whether or not your own religious <br/>\nbeliefs might interfere with this whole concept of supporting a child&#39;s <br/>\nnatural inclinations, though. I&#39;m not asking you to tell us about them, <br/>\njust suggesting that you might consider that one of the most basic <br/>\nbeliefs of unschoolers is that human beings are inherently &quot;good&quot; in <br/>\nmany ways. For some devout Christians, that flies in the face of their <br/>\nbelief that humans are born with a &quot;sin nature.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":385190857,"authorName":"Jimi Ann","from":"&quot;Jimi Ann&quot; &lt;jimi.jane@...&gt;","profile":"jannvane","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: New / Questions","postDate":"1238688127","msgId":43652,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdyMm5oditsMXJhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ5RDNENzI0LjgwMjA4MDFAbWFjLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":43645,"nextInTopic":43653,"prevInTime":43651,"nextInTime":43653,"topicId":43582,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you so much, Pam, for that very much needed perspective.

The part about her not having to govern herself, that she IS the way she is, rings so true to my ears.  And yes, expectations.  That&#39;s a biggie for me.  I need to re-read a book I got several years ago called &quot;Slowing Down to the Speed of Life.&quot;  I had forgotten about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my family&#39;s background, and the paths we&#39;ve pursued in the past, we need a lot undoing. My childhood was pretty much in the unschooling way of things, as far as lots of freedom, no expectations, etc.  But along with that came neglect and very little to no parental direction, as there were usually no adults in the home.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of that, and my bad choices in my 20&#39;s (By the way, Sandra, I also attended Al-Anon meetings and learned a lot.  We added S to the end of HALT, for Sick -- meaning physically sick)... Anyway, I was drawn to very structured environments, because of the lack of any kind of structure whatsoever in my childhood.  I had felt very lonely and isolated.  From that, I believe, is where I developed a great desire for structure and control.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve just come out from what I call &quot;our mennonite adventure,&quot; and we joined and lived among a strict group of mennonites (like the Amish but still drive cars).  Mine and my husband&#39;s deep Christian beliefs (not mainstream, and it prob. doesn&#39;t look much like Christianity as the average American Christian sees it -- although that&#39;s ok however one chooses to believe, I just say this to give you perspective on us), my stance on non-resistance, among many other things led us that way.  Also the simpler lifestyle, getting rid of a lot of needless things, and moving away from the world of affluence voluntarily -- also led us to the mennonites.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, we were very stifled and came to realize we can still have these beliefs, practice these principles in our own way, without being with the mennonites.  Sounds like a no-brainer now, but we didn&#39;t see it then.  We were where we were.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe children being in the one-room schoolhouse (just like the Amish) seemed so carefree and a such a beautiful alternative.  They had 3 recesses a day, never assigned homework, and were not so heavy on the academics.  But despite all these seemingly wonderful things, it was a real eye-opener.   It was the first time they had ever been in school, and the last.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how much any of you know about the conservative branches of mennonites, but they are very controlling.  We&#39;ve been out of that setting coming up on a year now, and my shoulders are starting to relax a bit.  This is prob. more than you wanted to know, but I feel by sharing it, it would help people here see where I&#39;m coming from.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more thing, I think I&#39;m having a great unschooling day today!  ALthough it is a little by default.  I developed a fever lastnight over 102, and my throat was &quot;closing up&quot; and I had a hard time swallowing.  I feel a little better today, but this has truly been a blessing in disguise, in that the children are leading themselves today.  I did have a chance to pick up 2 books from the library yesterday before I felt too ill -- one on unschooling by Mary Griffith, and one by John Holt, which I am devouring and already putting some of it into practice.  The fact that I can barely talk above a whisper is a real blessing in that it&#39;s difficult to control things without a voice!  LOL.  So I&#39;m grateful that I got sick.  :)  Maybe I will chronicle our day after the day is done, if anyone is interested.  You can tell me if you think we&#39;re making progress or not and give me helpful hints and insights if you like.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for all of your great insights.

With a combination of big kids and little<br/>\nkids/babies in our family, our days fall into a natural rhythm involving<br/>\nmeals, naps, and out-of-the-house activities, but there isn&#39;t a fixed or<br/>\nrigid routine that must be followed at all costs. We can change the beat as<br/>\nneeded.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, my kids like to eat breakfast before my husband leaves for<br/>\nwork, because he&#39;s busy in the kitchen for a while making his coffee and<br/>\nsuch, and they like to spend that chunk of time with him before he&#39;s gone<br/>\nfor the day. You could look at us from the outside and say, &quot;Wow, your<br/>\nfamily eats breakfast at 8am every day, that&#39;s really structured!&quot;--but it<br/>\nisn&#39;t a *required* structure, and it&#39;s no big deal if someone feels like<br/>\nsleeping later, or is lying in bed reading a book instead of eating<br/>\nbreakfast at that time of day. (Well, it might be a big deal if *I* did<br/>\nthat, because it would be hard for my hubby to get ready for work AND meet<br/>\nall the needs of the 5yo, the 2yo, and the baby while I was snoozing!) The<br/>\nkids are free to start the day off as they wish, and it happens that they<br/>\nusually all wish to be in the kitchen with daddy at that time of day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think rhythm can be organic, a pattern that grows out of what suits your<br/>\nfamily&#39;s needs and preferences, but it need not be inflexible or binding.<br/>\nRhythm can be nice and comfortable, and comforting (especially, I think, for<br/>\nvery young children).

I got that article from a blogpost at Dare to Know: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://daretoknowblog.blogspot.com/2009/03/autonomous-education-works.html.\">http://daretoknowblog.blogspot.com/2009/03/autonomous-education-works.html.</a> She has some ideas about why someone looking to research to justify an autonomous approach (again, the UK&#39;s closest equivalent to unschooling) might have a hard time doing so. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere isn&#39;t a lot of research directly on alternative approaches to home-education. There isn&#39;t any real reason to examine such a small subset of the population. It isn&#39;t something for which funding is readily available so anyone approaching it would have to be doing it for personal reasons as much as for any other reason. That means for you that you will never have more research behind an unschooling approach than he will have behind a more traditional education approach.  It means that you can&#39;t win if you see it as a fight. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe way a list like this works is by amassing a lot of personal experience and sharing it. It is anecdotal evidence, but in huge numbers. The way unschooling often works to comfort the partner who is less confident about it as a means to educate his or her children is by being this amazing relationship builder. It helps a lot if you have helped your partner to feel involved in his children&#39;s lives. Talking about things that they&#39;ve done, keeping a journal or a blog, those kinds of daily stories that talk about a rich and engaging life make a huge difference in the way someone who is less integrally involved in the day-to-day can see it all unfolding. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am guessing that your husband is really excited by all that he is reading and doing. He is so excited at the different pedagogical approaches to knowledge transfer (I love that piece of jargon that is used in universities in the UK, they don&#39;t call it teaching they call it knowledge transfer) and he wants so very much to enrich his children&#39;s lives. And to protect them from failure as adults. He wants them to do well and believes that the evidence he is finding argues that the best outcome will come from a more traditional approach to knowledge transfer. One thing that might make a huge difference in how he sees unschooling is going to an unschooling conference. Seeing families interacting with their children and children interacting within their families, it is so amazing. Listening to people talk about unschooling and talk about how it works in their households, seeing it as a working, applied approach to education, it is a powerful thing. There are<br/>\n a lot about these days, there might be one around the corner from you. And if you are like us, you can travel. We&#39;re flying from the UK to Sea-Tac this year to go to Life is Good in Vancouver, Washington. As well as taking the train to a conference in London. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Michelle Miller &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:michelle@...\">michelle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Monday, 30 March, 2009 10:36:18 PM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] research support<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHello!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy name is Michelle and I&#39;m new to this list.
