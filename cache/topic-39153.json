They&#39;ve been promoting the heck out of it on <br/>\nDisney Channel. They have four separate filler shows. One is &quot;Movie Surfers&quot; <br/>\nfor current in the theater movies - that is a great gig - one of the girls <br/>\nwent to interview Orlando Bloom on the set in the Caribbean for Pirates, <br/>\nanother guy went to New Zealand for Narnia. One is for promoting the DCOM&#39;s. <br/>\nOne is Disney 365 for promoting special events at the parks and around, like <br/>\nthe opening of a new ride or the premier of a new show. One is the Special <br/>\nReport that is for news of new stuff coming to DVD, whether theatrical <br/>\nreleases, dcoms, compilations of shows, or classic reissues. Lots of <br/>\ndifferent styles, lots of opportunities for young actors/aspiring reporters <br/>\nto work.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have the last version of Sleeping Beauty, which was two disc. I expect <br/>\nthat they are including much of the same historical material. It&#39;s really <br/>\ninteresting to see how the art work developed, and the conciousness with <br/>\nwhich all the artists worked up the particular different (at the time) style <br/>\nof the figures and backgrounds. Also how they had a ballerina dance the <br/>\nsteps for the animators. They still do that kind of thing today, only <br/>\nnowadays the dancers wear motion capture suits and put the movements <br/>\ndirectly into the computer.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe vocalist for Briar Rose/Aurora was chosen because they felt she had an <br/>\nability to slip from her nice speaking voice into singing operatically <br/>\nseamlessly.<br/>\n<br/>\nDisney has a Maleficent doll at the main store. Jayn was so excited to get <br/>\nher for one of her birthdays, 5 I think, that she refused to allow me to buy <br/>\nit for her when we were at Disneyland two weeks before her birthday <br/>\nserendipitously. She told everyone she was getting a Maleficent doll. So <br/>\nmany blank faces - she had to add &quot;from Sleeping Beauty&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe great thing about DVD&#39;s is how much Jayn enjoys the special features and <br/>\nmaking of stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe actress in &quot;Enchanted&quot; looks like my mom in her late twenties/early <br/>\nthirties. The doll of her - the one from the real part, not the animated <br/>\ndoll - looks even more like her. Bizarre. The Patrick Dempsey doll is a <br/>\ngreat likeness of him too. We have him dressed up as a prince from the <br/>\nfinale of the movie.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not parody. It&#39;s homage!<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I would read all the treasure chests of fairy tales from different lands that I could find at the library. My dad bought me this fantastic book of different versions of Sleeping Beauty from around the world. I loved the stories of kindness to strangers being rewarded and injustice being punished. I loved the settings, I loved the stories of someone unassuming becoming princess. There is something wonderful about discovering that magic is just around the corner and that anyone can stumble across a magical doorway. Over time it changed from fairy tales to Narnia and Alice in Wonderland and then it went very distopian, starting with When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit and moving into lots and lots of WWII books at the same time I had a fascination with the Donner party, which may have followed on from Little House on the Prarie. <br/>\n<br/>\nLinnaea went through a big princess phase. David has never been a royalist and he spent a bit of time showing her pictures of real princesses. I suggested he should include Grace Kelly, even if it was by marriage. Her response was that she didn&#39;t need the princesses to be real to enjoy them. We were in York once when Princess Anne was there and Linnaea and David and my dad went to see her. There was a woman with a Norfolk Terrier waiting to see the Princess as well, Linnaea was more impressed with the dog than with Princess Anne. Her princess phase was fairly brief. She far prefers animal stories to princess stories. But we had a lot of Barbie Princess computer games and she and I would sit together and use magic wands to color Barbie pages and to find magic gems. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.waynforth.blogspot.com\">http://www.waynforth.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nella has a little playmate who is obsessed with the disney princesse, <br/>\nand now ella is obsessed with them too.  while i don&#39;t have anything <br/>\nagainst princesses generally, i&#39;m challenged to learn what this <br/>\nparticular interest means to ella.  i have never been a huge fan of <br/>\ndisney, but we haven&#39;t banned them from our home--we just never <br/>\nwatched the movies until ella&#39;s friend introduced them to her.  what <br/>\ndo they mean to her?  what does she learn from THESE princesses, as <br/>\nopposed to other, more generic princesses?  and how do i explain why <br/>\nwe can&#39;t buy all these toys and books and costumes and auxillary <br/>\nitems when this young friend has EVERY.

It hasn&#39;t <br/>\nprevented her from pursuing a wide range of other interests or affected her <br/>\npersonality in any negative ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nDisney&#39;s influence on the visual signposting of the classic princess <br/>\ncharacters has resulted in the look of the princesses being largely <br/>\nappropriated by other princess doll makers, despite Disney&#39;s strongly <br/>\nprotectionist attitude to its proprietry characters. This actually makes it <br/>\neasier for us to find inexpensive similar enough dolls and stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nJCPenney ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/4uav59\">http://tinyurl.com/4uav59</a> ) has a surprisingly high quality (and <br/>\nwe are doll experts around here btw) set of 5 (FIVE!) beautiful (&quot;color <br/>\ncoded&quot; by costume) princesses, including a Belle, Aurora, Snow White, <br/>\nCinderella and Mermaid for *under* $20 by a Hong Kong based company called <br/>\nChic. Ours arrived within 4 days of our order.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrass Key continues to make licensed porcelain characters of all the <br/>\nprincesses from Disney. Costco usually has a bunch of them before the <br/>\nholidays that are absolutely beautiful- including some of the &quot;second tier&quot; <br/>\n(as I think of them) which are Mulan, Jasmine, Pocahontas, Esmerelda & <br/>\nTinkerbell. These are magnificently detailed with glass eyes and unique face <br/>\nmolds, saran hair in detailed styles and lavishly embellished costuming. We <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t believe we were seeing correctly when 3 year old Jayn asked for one <br/>\nand we checked the price - $17.95.  For that price she could have her Aurora <br/>\nto take on our road trip even if it did get broken. That doll saved us. She <br/>\ncarried it and played with it for hours every day including in the car. She <br/>\nnever dropped it until it finally slipped from my fingers some months later <br/>\nand the arm cracked. I mended it, and now it sits in the &quot;breakable dolls&quot; <br/>\nbox with her sisters, who are still treated with much reverence.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of Jayn&#39;s dolls are to be considered investments in her future. She <br/>\nintends to have a doll museum one day, including dolls posed in dioramas and <br/>\nbackgrounds she fully expects us to make together.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther princesses include Princess Peach/Toadstool and Princess Daisy from <br/>\nthe Super Mario Brothers world.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrincess dress up is very easy for us - I have been sewing better and <br/>\ncheaper replicas of the Disney princess dresses for years. I wish I had them <br/>\nto pass on to you, but they have all made thier way to the Goodwill or other <br/>\nneighbors. They will turn up at those thrift stores, as well as on ebay. <br/>\nAlso if the actual costumes are too expensive some of the Disney princess <br/>\nnightgowns are almost as beautiful as the dresses and much cheaper.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe own all the Disney princess movies, because it is totally worth owning <br/>\nrather than renting given the number of repeat viewings they all have. We <br/>\nare eager to buy the new Tinkerbell movie when it is released soon. But we <br/>\nalso have a number of other dvd&#39;s of the traditional fairy tales, as well as <br/>\nother versions in book form. Jayn has been very interested in comparing the <br/>\ndifferent versions.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarbie has some movies where the character is a Princess too. There is a <br/>\nlovely song &quot;To Be a Princess&quot; in &quot;The Princess and the Pauper&quot; which talks <br/>\nabout the pressures to be unfailingly polite and poised and take <br/>\nresponsibility for the comfort of others.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour dd might also like &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;(Anne Hathaway). Jayn does. Dh <br/>\nis working on a movie where his director is the son of the director of those <br/>\nmovies, who played the security guy Shades in &quot;PD II&quot;.

He<br/>\nhasn&#39;t been doing that lately.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut he has asked me gazillions of times to read Beauty and the Beast.

The Disney princesses are so fun -  <br/>\nthe movies are so great, the music is wonderful, the costumes  <br/>\ngorgeous. What&#39;s not to love? Beauty and the Beast is one of my all- <br/>\ntime favorite movies - not favorite children&#39;s movie, I mean favorite  <br/>\nmovie in general. It is the only animated movie to have been nominated  <br/>\nfor an academy award for best picture, I think, so I guess I&#39;m not the  <br/>\nonly one who loves it. Maybe rent all the movies in order and have  <br/>\nDisney princess night once a week. Make some food to go along with it  <br/>\n- baked apples for Snow White, for example!<br/>\n<br/>\nMake costumes - seriously. My girls never had a single store-bought  <br/>\nDisney princess dress, in spite of spending time in the Disney store  <br/>\nvery often. We made costumes a lot, though. When they are involved in  <br/>\nthe designing and making, they aren&#39;t nitpicky about how accurate the  <br/>\ncostume is, in my experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you go to Joanne&#39;s Fabrics or Michaels you&#39;ll find a lot of crafts  <br/>\nthat are Disney Princess related - simple embroidery and cross stitch,  <br/>\nplastic canvass things, latch hook rugs, paint by number, shrinky  <br/>\ndinks, beads, and on and on. There are a zillion stickers out there.  <br/>\nThere are coloring books. There are low-cost games.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh -  &quot;Pretty Pretty Princess&quot; is a pretty low-cost game that is SUPER  <br/>\nfun. When my girls were little it was generic princesses but now they  <br/>\nhave a Cinderella version and a Sleeping Beauty version. They are all  <br/>\nunder 15 dollars.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was little I spent a summmer making a whole puppet show of  <br/>\nSleeping Beauty - the Disney version. I made the basic puppets out of  <br/>\nsocks, but spent a LOT of time putting wings on the fairies and a  <br/>\ncrown on Sleeping Beauty&#39;s prince - stuff like that. I had my mom read  <br/>\nthe book and I was the puppet master to act out all the parts with my  <br/>\npuppets. Wish we&#39;d had video cameras back then - I&#39;d love to see it now.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of trying to figure out what a child is getting out of  <br/>\nanything, take it on faith that their interest indicates that, without  <br/>\na doubt, there is something of value in it for them. Support it. Enjoy  <br/>\nit. Expand it. Connect it to other things. Pursue it. Look for ways to  <br/>\nexplore it more.
