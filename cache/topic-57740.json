Carol is the one who wrote about her  <br/>\nson learning to read in his tens, when the three others had learned  <br/>\nmuch earlier.   The other was Lori Odhner.  I credit them a lot. I  <br/>\ncredit them in my book.  I&#39;ve arranged for Lori to come to two  <br/>\nhomeschooling conferences where I was also speaking, to do workshops.<br/>\n<br/>\nLori does an interesting marriage counselling ministry for her church  <br/>\n(The New Church, it&#39;s called) and I&#39;ve been following it more closely  <br/>\nbecause I&#39;m speaking at a marriage conference she runs every year, and  <br/>\nI want to be up to speed so I don&#39;t say something offensive to their  <br/>\nreligion. So I&#39;ve been reading on their site, I ordered a book, and  <br/>\nI&#39;m getting her daily e-mailing, &quot;Marriage Moats.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLori is a great writer.  She wrote articles for La Leche League  <br/>\nmagazines and newsletters and sites.  She has written beautiful  <br/>\nsongs.   Today she sent this. Benjamin is Down syndrome.  She has nine  <br/>\nchildren now, but when I met her she had four, and when she had  <br/>\nBenjamin she was in the middle of that series.<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes scary things feel big and long.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know the eleven days I spent with my baby in the hospital when he  <br/>\nwas five months old with severe failure to thrive felt like eons. I  <br/>\nforgot what sunshine felt like, and was shocked to blink in it again  <br/>\nwhen we went outside to go to another building for an MRI.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen they actually let me take Benjamin home. I panicked. Life was a  <br/>\nblur of caring for him, and I had no idea what my other six children  <br/>\nwore or ate for those eleven days. All I remembered was holding  <br/>\nBenjamin, nursing him, feeding him whole mashed avocados, taking  <br/>\ncopious notes, and praying.<br/>\n<br/>\nGradually I began to calm down a notch. In fact there was a quilt  <br/>\nmeeting that I wanted to go to, which felt incredibly selfish to even  <br/>\nconsider. Yet, if I took all his medical equipment, just in case, and  <br/>\nstayed only an hour, perhaps I could risk it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI gathered him up and started the drive along the Pasadena Freeway.  <br/>\nLooking behind me to check on him every twelve seconds was reducing  <br/>\nthe quality of my driving, but I was nervous. Then the little voice  <br/>\ninside me, the one I tell people they should listen to, said, &quot;Go on  <br/>\nthe side streets.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat? That was ridiculous. The freeway is faster and... and...<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Go on the side streets.&quot; it repeated.<br/>\n<br/>\nReluctantly I steered toward the off ramp and started up California  <br/>\nBoulevard. This blue blooded street is lined with fifty foot palm  <br/>\ntrees. The car&#39;s speed decelerated. My heart rate slowed down. On my  <br/>\nright was a hospital where I brought flowers to a baby who later died.  <br/>\nAt least my child is alive, I thought. Then I passed the rehab center  <br/>\nwhere I had visited a teenager who swallowed a bunch of pills. At  <br/>\nleast I am not facing that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen my car went over a bump, and in that instant my voice said, &quot;This  <br/>\nis a bump.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was outraged. How dare anyone suggest that this huge ordeal was only  <br/>\na bump. Harrumph.<br/>\n<br/>\nI arrived at the quilt store, and overheard the other ladies kvetching  <br/>\nabout the traffic on the freeway. Maybe that voice knew more than me  <br/>\nafter all.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwelve years later, it does look like a bump, if only because the  <br/>\nbumps have gotten bigger. I am not suggesting that it was easy. It was  <br/>\nthe on ramp to life with a special needs child that still leaves me  <br/>\nscanning for the exit.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it has also been the road that John and I have traveled together,  <br/>\ntaking turns driving, sometimes playful enough to turn on the music  <br/>\nand sing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57741,"nextTopicId":57684}}
