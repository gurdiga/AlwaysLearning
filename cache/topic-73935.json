Especially if you have littler ones, or preteens and have some fears about the teen years...seeing older kids and their interactions with family and to glean ideas from others further along the path is fantastic.  \n\nI was fortunate enough to attend the Toronto Unschooling Conference in 2007.  I couldn&#39;t have my family there though.  My kids were little, only 7 and 4 at the time, and now that my first was school age a new round of doubts had slammed me.  I  was (and pretty much still am) the only unschooler in my area and I even didn&#39;t know any eclectic homeschoolers.  I was the only non-christian non-school-at-homer i knew, and till that time my support was online, bookmarked web sites, and message boards. I felt like I was in uncharted waters.  Once I was there,  I remember the impact of having my fears examined, like some of those talks sounding like they were written just for me, and of being moved to tears.  It was so great to see people with older children and to see how interaction could be with them...no talking down, interacting with them as people, not the way conventional society seems to treat teens...I felt like I was being given a tantalizing peek into all that unschooling could be and how it was SO not just a &quot;method of homeschooling&quot;.  I don&#39;t mean to sound too dramatic when I say that it was lifechanging for me at that point in my journey!  Even though it is a number of years later, I am expecting much the same at the symposium in Minnesota and am looking forward to it, and I can bring my family to boot.  \n\nDefinitely take the plunge, people!  Or at least if time and money are a factor, get your hands on recordings if you can! :)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Getting to a conference","postDate":"1395570656","msgId":73936,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBCNUVDQjk4LTNERjYtNEM5NC1BNjEyLTA4NTA5Qjk5NjY0MkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PERCNzkyNjZGLTA5NTItNEVEQi1BMjY3LURDNEVGNTUyRkE4OUB5YWhvby5jby51az4=","referencesHeader":"PERCNzkyNjZGLTA5NTItNEVEQi1BMjY3LURDNEVGNTUyRkE4OUB5YWhvby5jby51az4="},"prevInTopic":73935,"nextInTopic":73939,"prevInTime":73935,"nextInTime":73937,"topicId":73935,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks, Vanessa. :-) I m really tired.

Secondly I&#39;d like to encourage people who have been unschooling for a good while but who may have not attended one, as it&#39;s so easy to get into bad habits, patterns of thinking or get off track, even when you don&#39;t realise. There is always more to learn, more inspiration, more great Sandra quotes, more more more. Also the learning from the fellow attendees, I heard some great stories and inspiration from them along with making great local and national connections.<br/>\nI thought I was doing a decent job at this but things came up for me this weekend that I hasn&#39;t realised was there and have come home really inspired and determined to up the sparkle and fun factor a level.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo get to a conference!<br/>\nVanessa<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPhone</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49617,"nextTopicId":73938}}
