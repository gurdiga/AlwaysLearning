All infanticidal males were fully<br/>\nadult and sexually mature unknown males. All kittens killed were<br/>\nwithin their first week of life. The killing pattern was generally the<br/>\nsame as that described in lions. All females reacted aggressively but<br/>\ncould not prevent the infanticide. Three hypotheses are discussed :<br/>\n(1) infanticide is a remnant of cat male reproductive strategy<br/>\nselected in the original environment; (2) the conditions of the rural<br/>\nenvironment have created a selection pressure encouraging a<br/>\npolymorphism of infanticidal and noninfanticidal males to evolve; (3)<br/>\ninfanticide is an abnormal behaviour caused by environmental<br/>\nconditions such as human disturbance.

She  <br/>\ntold my son last week that when she is 38 (no clue about the number) she was  <br/>\ngoing to hang herself in the family dining room in front of her kids. <br/>\nWhy? I don&#39;t know *yet but I suspect she is rebelling against her  parents.<br/>\n********************<br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt;The puzzle lies in the fact that if our daughter even senses that  she <br/>\nis about to learn something outside her interest area she shuts  <br/>\ndown.  If we were to ask her the time she will not respond since it  <br/>\ncould be construed as learning outside her field of interest.  If we  <br/>\nask her if she were to buy 5 additional fish then how many would she  <br/>\nhave.  She would then know she is being &quot;tricked&quot; into learning math  <br/>\nand will not respond.  Many times in conversation you can see that  <br/>\npresented information is being thought of as learning and so ends the  <br/>\ndiscussion.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n**********************<br/>\nThis is classic for a child who attended public school.

Watch them with her. Rent  <br/>\nthem so you can watch them in a &quot;marathon&quot; format. Find related  <br/>\nmerchandise to buy. Have FUN with it. Dress up like cartoon  <br/>\ncharacters for Halloween (whole family). Plan a trip to an animation  <br/>\nstudio - does she like Disney cartoons? Plan a trip to Disneyland and  <br/>\nCalifornia Adventure where they have a very cool animation studio  <br/>\nwhere kids get to engage in a bunch of animation activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re missing something big if you don&#39;t recognize what cartoons  <br/>\noffer. Lots of cartoons have really significant themes - friendship,  <br/>\ndanger, good versus evil, loyalty, and so on. Watch WITH her and look  <br/>\nfor the FUN in it. Get the jokes. Laugh. Do NOT make it into a  <br/>\nlesson, but just make it a together time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cartoons might be a way to escape from you. You&#39;ll never find out  <br/>\nbecause you appear to be treating her as an adversary - she is  <br/>\nsensitive to you trying to manipulate her into learning. Stop that.<br/>\nBe on her side.

I&#39;m pretty sure you don&#39;t  <br/>\nreally want to model that, right? What DO you want to model?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter has a hamster. It is in a nice big aquarium right in the  <br/>\nliving room and I take good care of it. I change its water every  <br/>\nsingle day. I give it little treats - whenever I&#39;m eating a piece of  <br/>\nfruit or veggie and cut off a little bit and give it to the hamster.  <br/>\nI feed it. I clean its cage.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is 14 and I still do all these things. Why? Because I  <br/>\ndecided when we got it that it was going to be a source of joy to our  <br/>\nfamily, not something to fight over and certainly not something to  <br/>\nmake my daughter feel ashamed about or like a failure. LOTS of times  <br/>\nI&#39;ll say, &quot;Hey, Rosie, give the hamster some food.&quot; Or, &quot;Rosie, come  <br/>\nhelp me change the hamster bedding.&quot; I don&#39;t interrupt her and I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t insist and if she doesn&#39;t find time I just do it, happily.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is NORMAL for kids not to take good care of pets. Why parents set  <br/>\nthemselves up for a daily battle, by getting pets under the condition  <br/>\nthat the children will care for them - is beyond me. A set up for a  <br/>\nkid to feel like a failure and everybody to end up with hard  <br/>\nfeelings. What I try to do is share the enjoyment of taking care of  <br/>\nthat sweet little hamster - if it isn&#39;t like that, then I don&#39;t ask  <br/>\nfor help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect your thoughts are filled with, &quot;But she &#39;should&#39; take care  <br/>\nof her own pets.&quot; &quot;But she shouldn&#39;t watch so much tv.&quot; &quot;But she  <br/>\nshould want to watch something better than cartoons.&quot; And so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou sound very angry at her that she&#39;s not rising to your  <br/>\nexpectations. In fact, you sound angry at her for not &quot;being&quot; a  <br/>\nbetter person.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a pretty horrible reality for a child to have to live with -  <br/>\nher parents not thinking well of her, in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really truly think that if you fix YOUR problem - change the way  <br/>\nyou think of her (especially that she doesn&#39;t fare well in  <br/>\ncomparisons to her brother) - you&#39;ll find that curiosity and love of  <br/>\nlearning will slowly return to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, you cannot MAKE that happen. What you can do is love her now -  <br/>\nSHOW that you love her by showing respect for her choices. And,  <br/>\ngently invite her to do things with you for the ENJOYMENT, not to  <br/>\ntrick her into learning something.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - no more exaggeration. How can she watch tv from 8 am to 10 pm?  <br/>\nDo you NEVER go out of the house with her?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really sad for you because you&#39;re missing out on the love and  <br/>\nlaughter and closeness of these wonderful years. I so understand  <br/>\nbeing worried about our children - that they won&#39;t be prepared for  <br/>\nthe future. I really do. But maybe you could just decide to take a  <br/>\nbreak from that worry, for now, for, say, one year. For one year just  <br/>\nfocus on ONLY the positives and LOOK differently at everything and  <br/>\ntry to see positives where you&#39;ve never seen them. Think more about  <br/>\ncartoons - watch them. Think about what is so great about them. Find  <br/>\nsome that you loved as a kid and rent them - my kids were pretty  <br/>\namused at how excited I got when we bought a &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; cartoon  <br/>\nfrom the dollar store. We watched it and I just laughed so hard - I  <br/>\nhadn&#39;t seen those cartoons for over 40 years. It was great. When  <br/>\nyou&#39;ve watched her cartoons with her and enjoyed them, a lot, maybe  <br/>\nyou can introduce some new ones - &quot;Kiko&#39;s Delivery Service&quot; is a  <br/>\nwonderful Japanese animated movie - same guy who made &quot;Spirited Away&quot;  <br/>\nwhich is absolutely gorgeous and weird and may or may not be to her  <br/>\ntaste.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo on a Disney movie kick - get one every day and watch it as a  <br/>\nfamily. Have popcorn. Have fun. And let it go if that doesn&#39;t  <br/>\ninterest her. Or just get it yourself and watch it and let her join  <br/>\nyou or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - think about why she&#39;d want to watch cartoons all the time?  <br/>\nWhat else is going on in the home? Cartoons are THE most attractive  <br/>\nthing to her, right now. Respect that - but you might wonder what  <br/>\nelse MIGHT be attractive to her. How about horseback riding lessons?  <br/>\nIce skating? Backpacking? Barbie dolls. Origami. Cooking.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes she have friends? Do they sit and watch cartoons with her during  <br/>\nthat 8 am to 10 pm time?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat else is going on? Is she depressed?<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease remember that how her parents think of her, now, is how she is  <br/>\nlikely to think of herself, when she&#39;s an adult.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150527288,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Stubborn ain&#39;t the half of it!","postDate":"1125939068","msgId":22942,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRmaHQxcys1amM2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":22941,"nextInTopic":22944,"prevInTime":22941,"nextInTime":22943,"topicId":22940,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On the other hand there is our daughter.

He is active with karate and <br/>\ntriathlons which is plenty!  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand there is our daughter.  To her t.v. is distasteful<br/>\n(in our eyes) cartoons fron 8am to 10pm daily!  Pottery class is her <br/>\noutside activity and she keeps frogs, saltwater fish and lizards as <br/>\nher intersts dictate.  These activites are second cartoons of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe puzzle lies in the fact that if our daughter even senses that she <br/>\nis about to learn something outside her interest area she shuts <br/>\ndown.  If we were to ask her the time she will not respond since it <br/>\ncould be construed as learning outside her field of interest.  If we <br/>\nask her if she were to buy 5 additional fish then how many would she <br/>\nhave.  She would then know she is being &quot;tricked&quot; into learning math <br/>\nand will not respond.  Many times in conversation you can see that <br/>\npresented information is being thought of as learning and so ends the <br/>\ndiscussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are also ready to disallow cartoons.  They have been the root of <br/>\nso much family disruption(not eating dinner together, just 5 more <br/>\nminites!!!, not taking care of other responsibilities first like <br/>\nfeeding pets.) and on and on.  We have considered letting pets die <br/>\n(we would need to lie if we let them go free) from lack of care as a <br/>\nlearning tool, yet we hate to see them suffer. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that is enough, I guess, to get the picture, any ideas?  We <br/>\nwill consider all options, if any.  We &quot;heard&quot; that &quot;if you think it <br/>\nis bad now just wait a few years&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening,<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff & Judi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22972,"nextTopicId":22969}}
