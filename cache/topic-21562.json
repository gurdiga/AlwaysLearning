(Marty had given me a clue of something  Kirby might <br/>\nlike that he couldn&#39;t afford to get him, so I did.)<br/>\n <br/>\nHolly asked for a sorting bank like one Kirby had had years before.   His had <br/>\nbroken, and he advised against it, but I said it was the only one she  had <br/>\nwanted <br/>\n <br/>\nA couple of days before Christmas Holly DID say &quot;I should have asked for  <br/>\nthis sooner, but for Christmas I would like a new doorknob for my room.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nI talked to Keith about it but didn&#39;t press.  On Christmas afternoon  she <br/>\nsaid quietly to me,  &quot;I didn&#39;t get a doorknob.&quot;  She had liked her  other gifts.  <br/>\n A few days later Keith installed her a new  doorknob.  Hers had gotten loose <br/>\nand noisy.  Quite worn  out. <br/>\n <br/>\nMarty&#39;s birthday is in January.  He didn&#39;t ask for anything.  In  fact, he <br/>\nsaid there wasn&#39;t anything he knew of that he needed.   We  had already gotten <br/>\nhim things before and stashed them by, and he was happy with  them.<br/>\n <br/>\nKirby used to like Ninja Turtles when he was little, and he still has them,  <br/>\nand still has all the tapes of shows he made from TV, and those we bought  <br/>\nhim.  It wasn&#39;t a passing-fad interest to be thrown by when the new TV  season <br/>\ncame.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21552,"nextTopicId":21563}}
