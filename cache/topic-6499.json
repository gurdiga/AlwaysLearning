Then a while back a friend sent me a couple of group names (Heidi are you <br/>\nhere?) but I couldn&#39;t find them either and I am sooo desperate to talk to <br/>\nsomeone else to sort through this unschooling life without first having to explain <br/>\nthe difference between hsing, unschooling and noschooling.

This is an incredibly amazing process<br/>\nthat kids start out without even realizing language exists and within a fe<br/>\nyears have mastered it. We shrug it off as mysterious but trivial because<br/>\nall kids do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think we really need to pay attention. They learn English purely as a<br/>\nside effect of living life and trying to get what they want. English is a<br/>\nuseful tool they happen to pick up and use one day because it was more<br/>\neffective than pointing. And the more they find it useful and the more they<br/>\npick it up the better at it they get. (And then compare how effective that<br/>\nis to how effective formal foreign language instruction is.)<br/>\n<br/>\nEverything is like that. Math and science and history and writing are all<br/>\ntools we use to get what we want and explore the world. Adding 15+23 isn&#39;t<br/>\nimportant. What&#39;s important is who is winning the game. And how much<br/>\nallowance they have accumulated versus how much they need. And how far away<br/>\nthis trip is compared to a trip they know well. And how much longer until<br/>\nDaddy gets home. And how can you double 3/4 cup so we can make a double<br/>\nbatch of cookies. Kids pick up how numbers work (and nature and people and<br/>\ncommunication) by using the tools. Despite what years of torturous math<br/>\ninstruction has led us to believe, kids don&#39;t need to be told to work<br/>\nnumbers in order to work them. They figure them out. Just as they figured<br/>\nout the intricacies of the English language.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He is concerned about, how<br/>\n&gt; do kids just know what to learn. (This is a very hard question to ask, the<br/>\n&gt; words aren&#39;t coming)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you need everything you were taught? Don&#39;t you use the things you need<br/>\nand have pretty much forgotten the things you don&#39;t? If kids&#39; learning is<br/>\nbased on acquiring what *they* need (and find interesting or intriguing)<br/>\nthen how can they not know what to learn?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne point is that learning that way doesn&#39;t take nearly as long as it does<br/>\nin school. Plus there aren&#39;t years of experience with learning being dull.<br/>\nIf a kid needs math to explore what he wants to in college, he&#39;ll have<br/>\nlearned (by using) enough math to get him as far as he is and can build on<br/>\nthat understanding to get the rest of what he needs. It *won&#39;t* take him<br/>\nyears. It will take months at most.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I guess what I am meaning is, if we don&#39;t direct them<br/>\n&gt; to... say Ancient Egypt or something else, how will they arrive there?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do they want to go to Ancient Egypt?

And so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen you&#39;ll say, hmm, maybe if I pointed out a show or brought home a book<br/>\nor a kit on hieroglyphs or pyramids or mummies .... And you can guage how<br/>\nmuch more to direct depending on their level of interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut their learning won&#39;t be about &quot;topics&quot; like that.

I don&#39;t &quot;direct&quot; the kids there, they just come <br/>\nacross things, and sometimes we look things up, and sometimes a book is on <br/>\nthe dining room table, or in the bathroom, and when we get to go to museums <br/>\nwe do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day we had a rented twilight zone DVD and one of the stories <br/>\ninvolved scarabs from Egypt.  It was science fiction, but there was one point <br/>\nof information.  Enough dots get connected, enough vocabulary, <br/>\npictures-in-heads, factoids, references, and the child has his own model of <br/>\nEgypt building, which he will add to for the rest of his life.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; if we don&#39;t direct them to... say Ancient Egypt or something else, how <br/>\nwill they arrive there?  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep their lives busy and open and encourage their joyous curiosity, and if <br/>\nyour family is never stagnant, the whole world will be right there, in your <br/>\nhouse, outside your house, in all kinds of literature and art and movies and <br/>\nartifacts all over the place.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you&#39;re living in the world instead of in school, Egypt is a lot closer <br/>\nto you than to school-kids, who need to wait for that one two-week unit on <br/>\nEgypt, out of their whole twelve years.  But if your kids have an aversion, <br/>\nthey can avoid two weeks.  And if they have an interest, they can &quot;study <br/>\nEgypt&quot; all they want to.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":98536371,"authorName":"Kinkade","from":"&quot;Kinkade&quot; &lt;kinkade@...&gt;","profile":"hsmomof4kiddies","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] New to this list","postDate":"1020176018","msgId":6516,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjAwMWMxZjA1MSQzOWIyN2IyMCRiMDhlYThjMEB3aW45ODAxPg==","referencesHeader":"PDE2NS5jODNhM2E1LjI5ZmYxYmZlQGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":6499,"nextInTopic":6518,"prevInTime":6515,"nextInTime":6517,"topicId":6499,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-250608339\">&lt;&lt; Another thought for ya, I live in FL too.
