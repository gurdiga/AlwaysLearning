She informs  <br/>\nbut also holds tight until she trusts they&#39;ll make the same choices  <br/>\nshe would.=<br/>\n<br/>\nA good friend of mine doesn&#39;t eat red meat.  As at the age of 7 (significant age in accordance with Steiner schooling), her daughter is now allowed to *choose* whether she eats meat or not.  Not without a large dose of judgement on behalf of the mother.  At a recent BBQ, the kid was offered a sausage, and the mother went into all the details of where the meat was sourced, the way it is slaughtered, etc,etc, with an obvious tone of coercion.  Obviously her daughter already *knew* all the gory details, yet still she chose to eat the sausage.  &#39;Blah, blah, blah&#39;comes to mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing that comes to mind with this topic, is how the term &#39;informed&#39; can be muddled with &#39;anti&#39;.  For example, I made an *informed* choice not to vaccinate my kids.  However, I have come to pass many comments that presume I am *anti* vaccination because of this choice.  This is simply not the case.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI am 36 years old; a child of conventional parenting.  I was raised with the understanding that there is only two ways to do things; right or wrong.  No choices.  During my mid-twenties I dared to go outside the square, and realised for myself there are Other choices.  I think this is why these *other* choices are given such respect.  So many of us were raised with &quot;my way or the wrong way&quot; mentality, that Any other choice seems better!  The excitement and illuminating light shining on the *better* way tends to overshadow the fact that there may be even More choice available.  That the very Freedom to Choose is what is missing the most.
