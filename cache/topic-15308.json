She has never been skinny, but I don&#39;t think <br/>\nanyone would say she was fat either.  She has been getting &quot;chunkier&quot; <br/>\nlately though, and it is really bothering her .  She wants to wear <br/>\nbikinis and feel good about herself in them, but she doesn&#39;t.<br/>\nI don&#39;t know really how to handle it because I was raised with a very <br/>\nweight conscious father, and have struggled all my life to keep my <br/>\nweight down.  It&#39;s always been a part of my self image, and I&#39;m not <br/>\nsure I&#39;m a great role model.  In the past year I have gained some <br/>\ncontrol through a change in diet and exercising.  I try to encourage <br/>\nmy dd to eat better and get exercise, but it&#39;s a hard line to walk.<br/>\nI don&#39;t want her to feel I would value her more if she were thin, but <br/>\ni don&#39;t want her to be unhappy with herself, so I&#39;ll remind her about <br/>\neating better, or getting more exercise.  We go back and forth on me <br/>\ntelling her she needs to make better choices(because she is <br/>\ncomplaining about being fat) and me just letting it go entirely, <br/>\nbecause I do know it has to come from her,not me.<br/>\nMy problem is the back and forth issue.  When I let it go, I feel <br/>\nlike I&#39;m not being a good mother.  When I bring up that maybe she <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t have that 3rd cupcake, i feel like I&#39;m harping. (because I <br/>\nam!)<br/>\nWe discuss it, and she knows she needs to eat better and get more <br/>\nexercise, but she never follows through.  When I offer to do active <br/>\nthings with her, or fix healthy foods instead of the things she fixes <br/>\nfor herself, she feels like I&#39;m trying to control her, and balks, so <br/>\nI give up.  Asking her if she wants to go for a bike ride can become <br/>\na huge drama.  She&#39;ll say &quot;no&quot; then she&#39;ll say she feels guilty cause <br/>\nshe knows she should, and that she knows I want her to, to get the <br/>\nexercise, then she&#39;ll come and whine the whole time.  So i stop <br/>\nasking cause it gets old really quick.<br/>\nI also know she is grieving Sam, and is also in the midst of puberty <br/>\nand that doesn&#39;t help the situation.  But she has always had a sweet <br/>\ntooth and tends to like to fill up on that stuff.<br/>\nI feel I should be helping her, but I don&#39;t know how.<br/>\nAny suggestions at all would be greatly appreciated.<br/>\nJoanna <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
