To me, the method is less important than the reason for learning.  If you&#39;re learning because you feel an obligation to accumulate languages or to please someone else, then that&#39;s something you&#39;re forcing on yourself.  But if something within you is just leaning in that direction, then I say follow that instinct until it doesn&#39;t feel right anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Danny Arsenault <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, October 24, 2003 1:24 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Unschooling Myself<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi,<br/>\n<br/>\n  I love John Holt&#39;s ideas.

Then I <br/>\nhave to remind myself that it isn&#39;t all about me or what I want, and maybe <br/>\nshe is just trying to tell me something and she doesn&#39;t know how or what words <br/>\nto use.

You might not be the <br/>\n  only person she&#39;s saying it to.<br/>\n  ####################<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think your suggestions are great, and thank you. I guess my problem is the <br/>\n  attitude. I have heard her use this same tone with others and it bothers me. <br/>\n  It bothers me because I wonder if she got that tone, response (I Know) and <br/>\n  attitude from me. (it also bothers me because one of the things I can&#39;t get rid of <br/>\n  is that old *what will they think* in the back of my head) I don&#39;t think she <br/>\n  did and I have been consciously listening to myself in conversations. Do I put <br/>\n  off people with eye rolling? Do I stop people who are trying to show/tell me <br/>\n  something with words like I know? I&#39;ve really been looking at that for a few <br/>\n  weeks now, I still don&#39;t see it in myself, and I hope I never do. I wonder <br/>\n  then, where did she get it? I ask myself if I am preachy or teacher like. Darin <br/>\n  says no, I&#39;m not, but he isn&#39;t exactly partial. I hope she grows out of this <br/>\n  like you said Kirby did. I don&#39;t want to force her to do things *my way* I grew <br/>\n  up like that. I don&#39;t want to chafe her. I keep my mouth shut most times when <br/>\n  she rolls her eyes and states she knows half way through even the shortest <br/>\n  statements telling her something. It&#39;s just coming to a head lately. Obviously I <br/>\n  can&#39;t expect her to know everything or that she know things like adults know <br/>\n  things and I don&#39;t want her life to be frustrating. It just seems like she is <br/>\n  making her life frustrating. Like the painting, she was frustrated that what she <br/>\n  wanted didn&#39;t happen. I could have said that she couldn&#39;t use that particular <br/>\n  brush, but I want her to be able to experience everything. I could have <br/>\n  ignored the other brush and just showed her how to use it, but she didn&#39;t give me <br/>\n  the chance to do even that. She was frustrated that the cookies were inedible. <br/>\n  I see that I could have just put the baking soda out for her and not said <br/>\n  anything about the powdered sugar being in a similar jar, I could have handed her <br/>\n  a few more stamps and said; &quot;this should do it.&quot; If I had though, would she <br/>\n  have resisted that as well? I guess I won&#39;t know. I&#39;m going to have to keep in <br/>\n  mind her frustrations and tailor my responses to her questions. And in the mean <br/>\n  time, hope she grows out of this need to make statements like &quot;I know&quot;. I <br/>\n  would love to come up with a gentle way to tell her that her tone and the eye <br/>\n  rolling puts people off, that it makes it so people don&#39;t want to tell her things <br/>\n  or show her how to do something.

(it also bothers me because one of the things I can&#39;t get rid of <br/>\nis that old *what will they think* in the back of my head) I don&#39;t think she <br/>\ndid and I have been consciously listening to myself in conversations. Do I put <br/>\noff people with eye rolling? Do I stop people who are trying to show/tell me <br/>\nsomething with words like I know? I&#39;ve really been looking at that for a few <br/>\nweeks now, I still don&#39;t see it in myself, and I hope I never do. I wonder <br/>\nthen, where did she get it? I ask myself if I am preachy or teacher like. Darin <br/>\nsays no, I&#39;m not, but he isn&#39;t exactly partial. I hope she grows out of this <br/>\nlike you said Kirby did. I don&#39;t want to force her to do things *my way* I grew <br/>\nup like that. I don&#39;t want to chafe her. I keep my mouth shut most times when <br/>\nshe rolls her eyes and states she knows half way through even the shortest <br/>\nstatements telling her something. It&#39;s just coming to a head lately. Obviously I <br/>\ncan&#39;t expect her to know everything or that she know things like adults know <br/>\nthings and I don&#39;t want her life to be frustrating. It just seems like she is <br/>\nmaking her life frustrating. Like the painting, she was frustrated that what she <br/>\nwanted didn&#39;t happen. I could have said that she couldn&#39;t use that particular <br/>\nbrush, but I want her to be able to experience everything. I could have <br/>\nignored the other brush and just showed her how to use it, but she didn&#39;t give me <br/>\nthe chance to do even that. She was frustrated that the cookies were inedible. <br/>\nI see that I could have just put the baking soda out for her and not said <br/>\nanything about the powdered sugar being in a similar jar, I could have handed her <br/>\na few more stamps and said; &quot;this should do it.&quot; If I had though, would she <br/>\nhave resisted that as well? I guess I won&#39;t know. I&#39;m going to have to keep in <br/>\nmind her frustrations and tailor my responses to her questions. And in the mean <br/>\ntime, hope she grows out of this need to make statements like &quot;I know&quot;. I <br/>\nwould love to come up with a gentle way to tell her that her tone and the eye <br/>\nrolling puts people off, that it makes it so people don&#39;t want to tell her things <br/>\nor show her how to do something.

He&#39;s still my friend, but <br/>\nat the time he was 20 or so, just out of teens, and he hung around with me a <br/>\nlot and he knows my family well.  Jeff Cunico.   Great guy.    We&#39;ve had many <br/>\nadventures, mostly SCA related.  At the time I first hung out with him I was <br/>\nqueen and he was new.  17 years later he&#39;s been king five times. I was his <br/>\nchief advisor a couple of those times, and often his editor/ghostwriter, speech <br/>\ntweaker and counsellor.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne time he said &quot;I learned to trust you not from the times I listened to <br/>\nyou, but from the times I didn&#39;t listen to you.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that can work with kids too.  There have been times I really wanted <br/>\nto pull Kirby back and say &quot;NO REALLY, listen to me.  Your way is not going to <br/>\nwork.&quot;   And sometimes I have done just that.  But when I&#39;ve &quot;made&quot; him do it <br/>\nmy way, he learned less than when I said &quot;Well that&#39;s not what I would do, but <br/>\ntry it,&quot; and didn&#39;t hold him down squirming.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first weekend he took his new cash card out, despite our reminders to <br/>\nchoose his cash machines wisely, he ended up with $10 in charges.   That he will <br/>\nremember well.  And he&#39;ll remember we were right.  And it only cost him $10! <br/>\n&lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy, with the stuff like the brushes or the postage, I think I would say &quot;I <br/>\nthink you say &#39;I know&#39; without realizing you say it, and it seems to mean <br/>\n&#39;the conversation is over.&#39;&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat makes it her turn to say something, or at least think.  You wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nhave to ask her to respond.  Just leave it lying there.  You might not be the <br/>\nonly person she&#39;s saying it to.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the brush, instead of telling her what the similarity is, if you think <br/>\nshe has a two-statement attention span, just give her the difference.    &quot;It <br/>\nworks differently from the other brush [in whatever way] so remember [whatever].&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the postage, I just have a scale.
