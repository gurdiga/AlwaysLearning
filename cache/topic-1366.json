If what <br/>\nhe says is correct, then none of the many people reportedly saved <br/>\nafter pentecost were really saved because they never attended a <br/>\nservice.  There was no church building, no service, no pastor.  Just a <br/>\nbunch of people who were committed to encouraging and exhorting each <br/>\nother daily, who lived and worshipped with each other, and who <br/>\nlistened to the apostles share about their time on earth with Jesus.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere were no church buildings until Constantine decided it wasn&#39;t <br/>\nfair that these Christians were meeting in homes when the pagans had <br/>\ntemples.  So, he started erecting &quot;Christian temples&quot; in which <br/>\nChristians began to have things that the pagans did--like choirs and <br/>\nthree point sermons--and the church started on its road to <br/>\ninstitutionalization.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen church doctrine conflicts with the Bible, it&#39;s time to turn our <br/>\nbacks on church doctrine.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJulie, I really think you would enjoy a book called &quot;Revolution&quot; by <br/>\nGene Edwards. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I recently started to doubt when the pastor of the Chruch we last <br/>\n </span></blockquote>attended<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (Nazarene).. said that a Christian knows they are saved..because <br/>\n </span></blockquote>they would<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; want to be in Church everytime the doors were open..Well it was <br/>\n </span></blockquote>never<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; something I really wanted to do.. just an obligation.
