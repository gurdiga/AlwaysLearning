When I read Claire&#39;s post from yesterday I realized I&#39;d been negative about the last two things we watched together and perhaps more since I wasn&#39;t looking for it before.  The first was &quot;Dexter&quot; which she started watching the other day from season 1 and it made me so sick my stomach was upset the rest of the day.  But I get why she likes it and she&#39;s always been drawn to crime shows, medical mysteries and forensics, loves Bones and CSI and House which I have enjoyed with her.  The other was a  little made for TV Disney film called Smart House that she was enjoying but which I criticized as silly and tedious.  I wish I hadn&#39;t said anything negative because it spoiled the feeling in the room which could have been warm and light but instead was crowded with my complaints about the writing and acting.  Next time I&#39;ll be more aware.<br/>\n<br/>\nKrisula<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: &quot;Does Unschooling Work&quot;?","postDate":"1281828978","msgId":56768,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU1REMyRENFLTg4NjctNEZCMC1BN0QxLTRFNzVFMzNDOTJGMEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDgxMjQ0MS4xMTQzNS5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNi5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGk0NzNtdCttc2xsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8ODEyNDQxLjExNDM1LnFtQHdlYjgxNTA2Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":56767,"nextInTopic":56812,"prevInTime":56767,"nextInTime":56769,"topicId":56761,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Next time they do sit and watcht with them.

Maybe it&#39;s because my kids are young (5 & 3), but in my case I can FEEL that unschooling is working when the kids are busy cooking up their latest potion, popping dolls in a carriage to go to the ball, zooming up and down the hallway on the scooter, choosing books for me to read while we snuggle on the couch; in short when the atmosphere in our home is peaceful. Even when there is conflict, it is resolved promptly, and in a peaceful way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can also instantly feel when things are NOT working, and it is in no way the fault of unschooling, but because I have hit a roadblock in my emotional response to the situation at hand. Case in point, recently the kids chose 2 Barbie movies from the video shop and wanted to watch them repeatedly. Now I completely understand about watching the same film over and over, and then moving on. This has been the pattern in our house for a long time. But, I had an overlay of discomfort about these particular movies because of half-formed thoughts swirling in my brain about female body image, shallowness and cringe-worthy plotting. A little negative, you could say.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the worst is that I did not overcome my negativity to try to see what the kids enjoyed about these films, I resisted putting them on for the kids, and it led to tears on their part and a real internal squirming on my part. Not just intellectually, but in my heart I could FEEL that what I was doing was wrong. Not &#39;wrong&#39; in a schoolish sense but wrong by my children. I was not putting our relationship first. I was taking away choices. Next time they choose a Barbie movie, I am going to leave that negativity behind.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, unschooling has brought and continues to bring so many tangible benefits that I KNOW it works. But it takes a lot to make it work. It takes a significant effort on the part of the unschooling parent to deal with their own emotional responses in a way that does  not damage their kids. It&#39;s an ongoing project. But the rewards are a relationship of love and trust with your kids that is beyond price, and kids who have an internal strength and sense of compassion that is truly powerful.<br/>\n<br/>\nClaire<br/>\nMelbourne, Australia<br/>\nKids - Ashlin, 5 & Eden, 3</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"&quot;Does Unschooling Work&quot;?","postDate":"1281710640","msgId":56761,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMxM0IwRjMzLUQ1NTMtNDQyMi05NkM2LTg4QUE1Q0E4NjY2NUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":56765,"prevInTime":56760,"nextInTime":56762,"topicId":56761,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Two people have written to ask if the list is down, because it s been quiet for a couple of days, so this is partly as a test message, but...
