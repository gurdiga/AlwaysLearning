Testing <br/>\nshould have a purpose, and these tests are more punitive than anything else.  <br/>\nIn the case of schools, the composite scores are used to snub other schools, <br/>\nor to get federal funding.  In the case of individual scores, they&#39;re used to <br/>\nput kids in special ed or gifted classes, to get federal funds.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNobody&#39;s going to give you any federal funds.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust get the test answer sheets sent in and forget it.
