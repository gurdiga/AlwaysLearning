I never thought about including him in that way. This really helped me today to talk with him when he was mad at our oldest daughter. He was very angry and convinced her problem was she needed more discipline so she could become a more disciplined person. <br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of telling him that I thought he was wrong, like I normally would have... which probably would have in turn made him angry at me because he would see it as me justifying her behavior... I spoke to him in the way I would have one of my children if they were angry at one of their sisters. I listened to him and asked him questions about what he would like to see happen. I told him I agreed that her behavior was not good and that I too would like to see an improvement and asked him what he thought would be the most effective way for that change to happen. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt worked out very well. In the end, he decided a more positive approach with our daughter was best. But, what you all said really helped me, so much so that I would have been okay even if he hadn&#39;t agreed with me in the end.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Unschooling As a Lifestyle","postDate":"1271787080","msgId":53106,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENFNUMzQTdFLTA0M0EtNEM2RC1CQUUyLTM1MkNGQjYwMkM2OEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhxa2VhbStjaGtkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhxa2VhbStjaGtkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":53078,"nextInTopic":53147,"prevInTime":53105,"nextInTime":53107,"topicId":53033,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-By explaining the unschooling lifestyle you d like to see from him, you are in effect invalidating his needs.

Unschooling has really intrigued me since I first heard about it a couple of years ago, but it&#39;s something that we haven&#39;t fully incorporated in our lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is completely on board with unschooling as far as education goes. He&#39;s become quite successful without a formal college education (he never passed the 10th grade) and was never sold on the importance of grades and college like I was. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a lifestyle, however, he wants everyone to fall in line, do things his way and stay away from &quot;his stuff&quot; (be it food, or chairs, or the &quot;good&quot; towels, etc). It drives me crazy. For example, lets say he&#39;s really into tofu hotdogs one week. He won&#39;t want anyone else eating the hotdogs. I&#39;ll tell him that I bought enough for everyone to have as much as they want, but he doesn&#39;t want anyone else touch what he&#39;s deemed to be his. I did figure out that he was okay with me buying the jumbo size ones for him and the smaller ones for the girls, but this is a constant struggle. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think he&#39;s like this because he never really felt like he had enough as a child and I don&#39;t want my children growing up feeling like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone had difficulty explaining the benefits of unschooling as a lifestyle to their significant other and getting them on board?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53038,"nextTopicId":53140}}
