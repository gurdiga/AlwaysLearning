If parents <br/>\nare going to turn a kid&#39;s interests into &quot;dreaded school work,&quot; it might be <br/>\nbetter if the parents did NOT notice the kid&#39;s interests. <br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4089,"nextTopicId":4126}}
