Florida has a  website <br/>\nwhere you can research the accepted high school classes and we  looked <br/>\nthrough them and found several that she could use just from some of her  interests <br/>\nthe past few years.  <br/>\n <br/>\nShe built a compost system for our family and planted an organic garden  last <br/>\nyear.  She spent way more than 120 hours buying seeds,  building raised beds <br/>\nfrom wood, and then working on her composting and  garden through the spring <br/>\nand summer.   She learned way more  than the objectives listed for the subject <br/>\n&quot;Environmental Science with  Lab&quot; so it was very easy to count that as a <br/>\ncredit.  The cool thing was  that she didn&#39;t do it to earn a credit.  It was all <br/>\nbecause she thought it  would be fun.  She loved every little plant that <br/>\nsprouted and we now have a  little garden area and compost system....and she in a <br/>\nroundabout way it paid for  itself and way more if she decides to use that <br/>\nscholarship money.  The  value of it was in the learning for her and our entire <br/>\nfamily as well as  the enjoyment of eating the food she had grown.  <br/>\n <br/>\n We found that we could do this for many things.  We included  some narrative <br/>\ndescriptions as well as a letter of our unschooling learning  approach.  It <br/>\ntook some time and creativity but it was well worth it.<br/>\n <br/>\nShe&#39;s been accepted at her two top college choices plus received the  full <br/>\ntuition scholarship as well as some others.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf your daughter wants to explore Biology,  I&#39;d recommend  watching some <br/>\nDVD&#39;s or just looking at the areas that Biology  encompasses and see if some of it <br/>\ndoes interest her.  Branch out from  there and something might just be a <br/>\nspark that leads to other things.  120  hours is not much if she finds something <br/>\nshe enjoys and loves learning  about .
