It was certainly &quot;taught&quot; to millions of people in school ad the right way to sleep, and the only healthy reality.  If that is health, then a lack of that must be disease! And sure enough, there are drugs to &quot;cure&quot; the things that keep people from sleeping naturally, so that they sleep like the people in school health books.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was happy and healthier when I stopped being upset or embarrassed or frustrated for waking up at 3:00 a.m. and accepted it as a useful thing.  I might just get up and go to the toilet, or check the cats, or see if it&#39;s snowing or get a drink of water.  When my kids were all still here, I might check to make sure the door was locked, see who was home, maybe adjust the heat.   One or two useful things and go back to bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that they&#39;re grown and elsewhere, sometimes I get up altogether and write for a while, or clean the kitchen, and later if I want to, I go back to sleep.  That&#39;s a luxury of not having young children to take care of.  It happens, someday.  I also remember having three very young children for many years.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever your life is now, it won&#39;t be that way for long.  So if it&#39;s great, appreciate it.  If it&#39;s not great, don&#39;t project that out for years.  Things change.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/sleep/outside\">http://sandradodd.com/sleep/outside</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":73405,"nextTopicId":73550}}
