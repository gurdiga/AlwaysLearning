It is not school.  That sets the tone I<br/>\nthink, for what people initialy think and feel about<br/>\nunschooling, both supporters and nay-sayers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is a mindest that for us flows freely into<br/>\nand connects with all the other aspects of our lives<br/>\nin other ways.  The unschooling life leads us to other<br/>\ngrowth and change, opening our minds to new freedoms<br/>\nand challenges, striving to follow our dreams both as<br/>\na family and as individuals.  I don&#39;t really care for<br/>\nthe term Unscooling, but I utilize it as something<br/>\nthat others rqecognize and connect with, something<br/>\nthat conveys a message aobut us and our lives<br/>\ntogether, something that allows us to network with<br/>\nothers.  I would prefer a term less couched in the<br/>\nnegative and associating with what we DON&#39;T believe<br/>\nin.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend FREE Valentine eCards with Yahoo!
