But I understand Southern Baptists, and I understand why people <br/>\nwould be structured homeschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone &quot;understands&quot; that smoking is bad for them, would they keep <br/>\nsmoking?<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess so.  I guess lots do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that daily meditation is hugely beneficial to people and that <br/>\nwalking would make my ankle stronger, but here I sit.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think it&#39;s possible.  People have priorities and personal realities.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be fun to look at what &quot;I know that&quot; means in various contexts in <br/>\nand out of school situations.  At one time I must have known and understood <br/>\nthings about Jonathan Swift.  I have a letter on an old transcript that says I <br/>\nproved I understood British satirists.  It didn&#39;t change my life. Shakespeare <br/>\ndid.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLanguage is really limited.<br/>\nIfI say &quot;I understand you&#39;ve started shooting heroin&quot; that doesn&#39;t mean &quot;I <br/>\ncompletely understand why you would choose to do so&quot; (though in the case of the <br/>\nperson I&#39;m thinking of, I do understand).   And I won&#39;t see her in person so <br/>\nit won&#39;t come up.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17714,"nextTopicId":17707}}
