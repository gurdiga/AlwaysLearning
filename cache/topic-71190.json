When children don&#39;t get enough positive attention, they resort to doing things to get NEGATIVE attention (because attention is attention, right?). With our son, we just keep saying yes, and when he becomes demanding or hateful about it I get on his level and explain to him that &quot;I don&#39;t like being talked to like that, it hurts my feelings and makes me sad.&quot; Between my showing him respect and kindness and expressing my feelings to him, he is becoming less demanding and controlling. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; For example, nearly every time I have a meal she starts having a tantrum because she wants me doing something with her instead.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Try having your meals together. Try scheduling your day so that you get the most out of your time together. Need to do some chores? Invite her to help or to talk to you while you do it (my children love to help do laundry!). Try spending some time out of the house together - go for a walk around the neighborhood, go play in the park, go to a museum or zoo, that kind of thing. Let her know that you value her as a PERSON, not just as a child.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in a nutshell, continue to show kindness and don&#39;t be afraid to tell your child how you feel about a situation - they can process a lot more that we give them credit for sometimes :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;seamanjane&quot; &lt;seamanjane@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been unschooling my almost 5 year old daughter from birth and I would love some ideas on how to work more in partnership with her so I can get my own basic needs met in peace.

I pondered on them today and I had a wonderful day with my daughter. All the things suggested I actually already do with my daughter - for example, I do special play time with her where she has my undivided attention, I attend to her needs all the time, I always eat where she wants me to (the problem with that one is if I ask occasionally to be at the table (if I have soup and I don&#39;t want to sit on the floor with it spilling everywhere) and she gets bored with me at the table because she wants to be in another room, or upstairs, and even if I give her something to play with or a video to watch she still gets fed up - she herself doesn&#39;t eat regular meals, so I realised today she just gets fed up waiting for me, and that&#39;s ok now - I really was expecting too much from her for her age). Also she does play in the bathroom when I shower etc. So on the face of it, it &quot;looks&quot; like I give everything that she needs. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, what I realised was what Sandra pointed out - I was using negative language and negative thoughts especially during the shower and the meals, because in my head I wanted that time to myself, even though I wasn&#39;t having it. And it&#39;s interesting Sandra that you thought I was eating my meals alone, because even though I&#39;m not, in my head I actually would have liked to have been, and that&#39;s where the conflict was coming in. So today I changed it all. I read the links you sent me, and decided to be grateful for the time I have with her, and expect less from her, and I really just connected in much more. And we had a dream day. We were connected. I even got to eat my meal &quot;in peace&quot; but the thing was it didn&#39;t matter if I didn&#39;t, and that&#39;s where the change came in.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo thank you all again.

She&#39;s only 4, and maybe she&#39;s more needy than average, more high-intensity. Both my kids were a lot more intense when they were younger, and one was hugely social and needed a ton of attention. It helped me to step back from the idea that I was going to have some kind of picture-perfect family life with regular showers, lovely meals, and adult conversations for a few years. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;(very much what my own mother did to me - I was highly controlled and I&#39;m aware of this and currently working through it in therapy)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*************<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s entirely possible that your daughter&#39;s need for attention has a genetic component - and that you mom also had a big need for attention which wasn&#39;t met as a child. So she was controlling in part as a way to make up for her own childhood lacks. You can&#39;t go back in time and help your mom or your child-self, but you Can give your daughter lots of love and care and attention now. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt will help to step back from the idea that your daughter is trying to control you and instead see a little girl with big needs. She needs lots of attention. Accept that as a Need and look for ways to meet it proactively - it&#39;s sooooooooooo much more effective with kids who need lots of attention to love them up Before they&#39;re clamoring for you. They get their needs met better And you get to feel more in control - you&#39;re choosing to give attention rather than putting out fires. It&#39;s less stressful all around. <br/>\n<br/>\n Maybe she needs ways to feel secure and/or in control, too - so look for ways to help her in that way. Play games which let her be in control of something specific. Let her make choices which are important to her whenever possible. Sometimes kids seem controlling when what they want is to do things for themselves, so look for that possibility. Conversely, sometimes kids seem controlling when what they want is to be helped with things they can, technically, do themselves - so look for that possibility, too - if she asks for help with things, do them without arguing. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":377201113,"authorName":"mitrisue","from":"&quot;mitrisue&quot; &lt;julesmiel@...&gt;","profile":"mitrisue","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Feeling Controlled","postDate":"1366044281","msgId":71199,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtraGFwcCttZTdiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGtrZmFrNCtwZTNmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71198,"nextInTopic":71200,"prevInTime":71198,"nextInTime":71200,"topicId":71190,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

As far as I know, my daughter did not suffer any early years trauma and she is pretty similar.<br/>\n<br/>\nI spend most of every day with her and she would be quite happy if it was all of every day. She is almost seven now, but when she was a lot younger and I hadn&#39;t read on this list quite so much, she would get very upset when I ate, cooked, cleaned or showered. Pretty much any situation when I wasn&#39;t giving her full attention. I, in return would feel stressed and often resentful.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading on here helped me to be grateful that she wanted to spend her time with me and to realize I could nurture that feeling or just the opposite by carrying on being as I was. Now, I&#39;m grateful that she wants to spend so much time with me and realize it wont be long before that changes. I tell her often how happy I am she wants me to do so much stuff with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also found practical solutions. I almost never showered when it was just the two of us. I would wait for my husband to come home or I would get in the bath with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I cook, I do most of the prep sitting down with her or we play imaginary games which she loves and are easy to do in the Kitchen. She has her own play kitchen too or sometimes brings a small mattress in there and puts her toys on and plays. More recently she cooks with me. I do one or teo big cooks a week too so I don&#39;t spend too much time on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith eating, can she sit and snuggle you as you eat? Does she eat at the same time as you? Are you sitting away from what she&#39;s doing as you eat? If so, can&#39;t you sit with her?<br/>\n<br/>\nThings have changed pretty dramatically in the past two years too. Now she spends a lot more time with my husband. I get whole mornings on my own on the weekends when they go out and I can have a bath or catch up with housework.  It&#39;s true she also sleeps longer than I do, so I have at least an hour to myself in the morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the practical solutions though, are not going to work unless you make that switch in your brain and see what your daughter sees and feels and you try to think about this in a different way.<br/>\n<br/>\nRachel<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 15 Apr 2013, at 05:42, Lillie M &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:milesdt@...\">milesdt@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Can you tell me if anything about your daughter&#39;s earlier years, including<br/>\n&gt; your pregnancy and her birth, was traumatic?

Invite friends over - usually when a child has a guest, the parent<br/>\nactually gets some free time (sometimes you might need to stay nearby)<br/>\n<br/>\n2. exchange play dates - she could spend an afternoon or two at someone<br/>\nelse&#39;s house and you have her friend at your house a time or two a week.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. hire a mother&#39;s helper to entertain her for a couple of hours a couple<br/>\nof times a week<br/>\n<br/>\n4. doesn&#39;t she ever watch tv or movies? Those are good times for you to<br/>\neat, fold laundry, straighten up the room and, if she&#39;s really involve with<br/>\nit, maybe even take a shower.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Most important - she can join you in whatever else you need to do.<br/>\nInvite her to joyfully help you in cleaning the bathroom, folding laundry,<br/>\nand all that kind of stuff. If you&#39;re doing it with a happy attitude, it&#39;ll<br/>\nbe more appealing.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. she probably sleeps more than you do - do things while she&#39;s asleep.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. take a deep breath - this time shall pass (and you&#39;ll miss it)<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":551912585,"authorName":"seamanjane","from":"&quot;seamanjane&quot; &lt;seamanjane@...&gt;","profile":"seamanjane","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Feeling Controlled","postDate":"1365978564","msgId":71190,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtrZmFrNCtwZTNmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":71191,"prevInTime":71189,"nextInTime":71191,"topicId":71190,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve been unschooling my almost 5 year old daughter from birth and I would love some ideas on how to work more in partnership with her so I can get my own","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1796875571\">I&#39;ve been unschooling my almost 5 year old daughter from birth and I would love some ideas on how to work more in partnership with her so I can get my own basic needs met in peace. For example, nearly every time I have a meal she starts having a tantrum because she wants me doing something with her instead. Same when I have my morning shower. Then while I&#39;m eating she&#39;s hassling me all the time to hurry up or she starts jumping on me so I can&#39;t eat in peace. If we have dinner. This is all my own fault because I have allowed her too much control over my life and I feel she now believes that she can say where she wants me and what she wants me doing during the day (very much what my own mother did to me - I was highly controlled and I&#39;m aware of this and currently working through it in therapy). As you can see the balance is wrong but I literally do not know how to peacefully and lovingly help her understand that I have rights too, the main ones being to have meals and a shower in peace. Also I spend nearly the entire day engaged with her and don&#39;t spend too much time on chores or cooking (again I&#39;m thinking maybe I should be doing more of those things so she can see I have a life too, but as soon as I start she starts shouting at me to stop and to come play with her). I think she thinks I should be playing with her 100% of the time and do nothing else all day. I know I have created this myself and I would love some ideas for modifying this so we can live more in partnership with each other.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71218,"nextTopicId":71214}}
