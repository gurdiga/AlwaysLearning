She also loved watching You-Tube videos of game play and other things. Repeatedly suggesting the same &quot;solution&quot; of going to the group events, did not help her, or our relationship. Being sympathetic, and organizing more one-on-one visits did help. <div><br></div><div>One of the keys for Jayn is having access to Skype, so that she could (and can) connect with her friends. Now, four years on, she seems to have many friends that she speaks to daily, and she has three different technological paths to facilitate the interactions. (Phone, laptop, desktop computer - although the latter needs maintenance at the moment). Still she communicates directly in real time via Skype, as well as more slowly via Facebook, via Instagram, via Texting, and via in game chatting on WoW or other games. She and her friends will watch the same You Tube video &quot;together&quot;, each on their own computers while chatting through another means. It is actually really cool. They also send each other memes or articles - like in the olden days when you had to clip the magazine column and mail it in an envelope. [NO nostalgia - this is way faster and easier.]</div><div><br></div><div>Anyway, I used to worry just a bit that she seemed lonely, but I also knew that she was intentionally choosing not to participate in most of the resources that were/are available to her. So it was better to respect her choices, not push stuff on her that just irritated her, and not get into a thought spiral that she was &quot;missing out&quot; or &quot;not taking advantage of whatever&quot;. That kind of thinking gave me an anxious demeanor that made her want to push away.</div><div><br></div><div>Instead I cut way back on telling her about things going on. She wanted me to never, ever tell her about events happening in the homeschooling community (there is a lot here in Los Angeles) but never was too hard for me. So we made a deal that I would only occasionally mention events that sounded extremely cool that I heard of, and only once without pressure, and her side of it was that she would not get mad when she said &quot;no&quot;. </div><div><br></div><div>As a family we recently came up with the idea that we would each make a list of places that sounded interesting - mostly restaurants - that we wanted to go to. Many are in our local area, that is still new after one year (one year in our new house! Wow, so fast). Then next time we are bored or antsy, we have a ready made list of outings from which to choose. Still working on the lists - but there is an awesome donut place (cronuts!) just a little ways up the road, that is always a good place to go.</div><div><br></div><div>As for the cookie making - projects that sound interesting at first sometimes become overwhelming once started. In that situation I would have asked her whether she wanted me to finish them for her, or if she wanted to come back and put them out on the baking sheet when the mix was ready, or perhaps come back when they were ready to decorate (depending on the cookie type obviously). I would finish them, but leave the door open for her to rejoin the process. If she didn&#39;t want me to do anything with them, I would put them away in the fridge. </div><div><br></div><div>In my case, since I know Jayn, I would be 99% sure that she would not come back to that particular project, having left it - so after a day, I&#39;d tell her I was worried about the mix deteriorating, and offer to make the cookies again. And I would be 99% sure that she would say to go ahead. But she does like to be asked. </div><div><br clear=\"all\"><div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1710026082gmail_signature\"><div dir=\"ltr\">Robyn L.

as&nbsp;“aimless.” &nbsp;As though she should have&nbsp;“an aim.” &nbsp;“Morose&nbsp;“ is not an everyday word. &nbsp;If you have that word inside you, or the phrase&nbsp;“morose and aimless,” did it come from the outside? &nbsp;Did someone say that of you or a sibling? &nbsp;I’m asking because it’s easy for a phase of a child’s life to trigger memories of our own lives. &nbsp;And then the voices and recordings are triggered.</span></font></span></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-763403225\"><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-763403225\"><font color=\"#141823\"

Not &#39;don&#39;t have anything to do right now&#39; bored, but bored in general. She appears &#39;stuck&#39;. I have three younger children. They often all appear bored at home and things I suggest are often not of interest to them - this is a years long pattern...nothing new! But the three younger ones see friends a lot, enjoy going to groups and are busier than my 11 year old, with things that they suddenly think of and go off to do. But my 11 year old, I&#39;m starting to worry about. She has had little or no contact with her friends for quite some time now - just through circumstance (I try to arrange things and it&#39;s just tricky) and the fact she won&#39;t go to group things. I&#39;ve tried suggesting things she and I can do together, thinking that some nice connecting time with me will help, but we&#39;ve never found it easy to find common ground and it&#39;s no different now really.&nbsp;<br class=\"ygrps-yiv-634754860\"></span><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-634754860\" style=\"display:inline;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:Helvetica, Arial, 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;line-height:19.3199996948242px;\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-634754860\">Occasionally we&#39;ll enjoy a game together; we were planning to watch some documentaries together again, but she&#39;s only interested in doing it when it&#39;s not possible to do so; she spends most waking hours in her room watching things on youtube in her pyjamas. She played with her sisters and an adult visitor this morning and then, after he&#39;d left, minecraft with one of her sisters for half an hour before doing something that&#39;s becoming usual for her - suddenly stating &#39;I&#39;m bored&#39; and stopping abruptly. She used to be lit up by minecraft - made her own videos, played with lots of people online via Skype, making friends all over the country. Now she seems to have gone off that and appears to be left a bit empty.&nbsp;<br class=\"ygrps-yiv-634754860\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-634754860\">She goes to my parents&#39; house (very close) and comes back animated and happy having been occupied the whole time with something meaningful, but something stops her doing anything like it in our house. The other day she started making biscuits and got bored half-way through and just left the mixture sitting on the side. I am arranging visits and such like for us all as a family - things she&#39;s asked for and looks forward to - and she seems a bit more upbeat for a little while afterwards, but then goes back to being morose and aimless-seeming. She doesn&#39;t ever want to go to group things. She and I don&#39;t get on very well in the same way she gets on with her Dad, who is very good at helping her out of slumpy feelings but who is out of the house a lot with his work. When I try to help her I just end up annoying her and then we both end up getting upset. I&#39;m at a loss.&nbsp;<br class=\"ygrps-yiv-634754860\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-634754860\">I&#39;d be very grateful if anyone could offer me a chink of light with which I could help her find that spark for something again. Many thanks.</span></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75069,"nextTopicId":75115}}
