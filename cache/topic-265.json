Yes, sometimes it was that I was good at something and/or worked really hard.  But most of the time it was because of my talent, if you will, at reading others.  Especially teachers/professors.  I was always really good at giving them what they wanted, although each one wanted something different.  But I never really understood what I was doing until college.  I took a lot of history classes as electives because I like history.  And I usually took classes from the dept chair.  One day a history major saw my grade on a mid-term and was incredulous, he asked how I got an A, no one ever got A&#39;s from this professor.  I told him that he was my easiest professor because I only had to recount the professor&#39;s personal opinions as to why an event was important.  It made history fun to see the big picture without having to memorize dates.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen the big epiphany.....not because this history major could not understand the importance of history without dates but  because he couldn&#39;t figure out how to get an A on the exam.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, tell your daughter for me (if you haven&#39;t already) that success in college/public school does unfortunately sometimes depend on knowing what the professor wants and giving it to him even if it&#39;s not what you think you should.  Kinda sounds like marriage sometimes too &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy in VA (who also used this &quot;talent&quot; in an &quot;enriching&quot; way when she waited tables ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":262,"nextTopicId":258}}
