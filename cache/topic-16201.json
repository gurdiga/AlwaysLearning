While it might be true that three nails were<br/>\n&gt; used -- and, in fact, archeological evidences uncovered by Biblical<br/>\n&gt; researchers positively point to this conclusion -- it is erroneous, and<br/>\n&gt; theologically dangerous, to make this a doctrinal position. The Bible does not<br/>\n&gt; enumerate the Lord&#39;s nails and any extra-Biblical research on the subject --<br/>\n&gt; while both interesting and useful for apologetic purposes when dealing with<br/>\n&gt; those afflicted with a Secular world view that denies even the historicity of<br/>\n&gt; our Lord&#39;s passion and crucifixion -- cannot be considered of any substantive<br/>\n&gt; import to the Faith.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And on the kids page which would be funny if it wasn&#39;t so sad what they want<br/>\nthe kids to believe:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you find an Atheist in your neighborhood,<br/>\n&gt; TELL A PARENT OR PASTOR RIGHT AWAY!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You may be moved to try and witness to<br/>\n&gt; these poor lost souls yourself, however<br/>\n&gt; AVOID TALKING TO THEM!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Atheists are often very grumpy and bitter and will lash out at children or<br/>\n&gt; they may even try to trick you into neglecting God&#39;s Word.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Very advanced witnessing techniques are needed for these grouches.

It&#39;s a great song, and could probably be taken either in support of Jesus or as a parody.  (www.catlovescrow.com)   Well, we were sitting around talking about the song one evening and wondered what we would find if we typed in www.jesus.org.  Expecting to find that some religious organization had snapped up the URL, we were rather surprised to find it was a strange site by some guy with long hair sitting in a hot tub with a bunch of women.  Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s still there.  Gave us a chuckle though.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a slightly different angle, when a neighbor of mine died, I discovered in her obit in the newspaper that I live in a Christian neighborhood.  I wondered how they determined that.  There are certainly no signs to indicate that the entire &#39;hood shares a religion, nor is there anything in the neighborhood covenants.  Maybe it is true though.  We are one of 4 homeschooling families in the neighborhood and the other 3 are very vocal about being Christian homeschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- Christians own the internet and THIS guy, who doesn&#39;t know humor when he sees <br/>\n  it, is a guardian of civilization?

Yikes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the objectives:<br/>\n<br/>\n*   Contact the webhost of Landover Baptist and inform them of what they are <br/>\nhosting. Clearly they are unaware of the contents of this site, or else it <br/>\nwould have been deleted. If the webhost is part of the anti-Christian agenda, <br/>\nthen we must contact any other of their service providers - including the phone <br/>\ncompany, domain name service, etc. - that are unknowingly being used to further <br/>\nhatred and inform them of Americhrist Ltd.&#39;s true intentions. <br/>\n*   Next, we should bring the site to the attention of the makers of Internet <br/>\nfiltering and blocking software. Ultimately, Landover Baptist is much more <br/>\ndangerous than any pornography site since it leads people to reject their only <br/>\nhope for salvation! <br/>\n*   Petitions! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that does go along with a discussion on the bigger unschooling discussion <br/>\nlist in which Joyce tried to explain that some religions can&#39;t be tolerant.  I <br/>\nknow they can&#39;t be tolerant, but I don&#39;t think Landover and other parody <br/>\nsites are leading people to reject salvation.  Sheesh.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not supposed to be funny, but it is funny.  <br/>\nWhat&#39;s not funny is that people who believe things like that are <br/>\noverwhelmingly likely to be involved in homeschooling.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16214,"nextTopicId":16218}}
