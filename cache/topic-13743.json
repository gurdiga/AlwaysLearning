My daughters  5 & 8,  are going to be in the summer production of Winnie the Pooh.   This is their first play.   They get to be animals in the forest,  dress up, sing and dance!   We are so excited!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have never been in a play,  but I&#39;ve always had a secret desire to do so.   I sit and watch and dream.
