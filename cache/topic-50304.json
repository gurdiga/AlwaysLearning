Whenever I<br/>\nhave lost weight its been because I was happy, played with my kids and had a<br/>\nproject of some sort.  I have lost weight while consuming food slathered in<br/>\nwhipped cream, drank juice, eaten fruit smoothies made by my kids, but have<br/>\nmanage to gain weight on supposedly low cal. healthy diets.  The body needs<br/>\nto burn the calories it takes in, so you can cut the calories down but if<br/>\nyou aren&#39;t active you will still gain weight.  The human body is an amazing<br/>\nthing, and will actually start storing fat if an abrupt famine happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nI met a very thin family from Switzerland, who have since returned home,<br/>\n who used heavy cream, full fat yogurt and consumed chocolate in some form<br/>\nat every meal.  They came to Canada from the U.S. and the mother confided<br/>\nshe gained weight in the U.S., though in Tennessee where they were living<br/>\neveryone was fat conscous and calorie conscious; so low fat food was served<br/>\neverywhere, and she had to special order full fat yogurt from the local<br/>\nstore.  She lost the weight when they moved to Canada, when the family went<br/>\nback to their &quot;regular&quot; higher fat diet. From what I understand getting<br/>\nenough sleep, being active, being happy and enjoying your family are all<br/>\ngood ways to lose weight!  In the U.S. the mother noticed they were less<br/>\nactive and drove their car more, though they consumed fewer calories in the<br/>\nU.S. than in Canada but they slept less and drove more in the U.S.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe monkey platter is a great way to health imo Sandra(little bits of<br/>\neverything)!<br/>\n<br/>\nMarina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: A diet/food moment","postDate":"1264982837","msgId":50319,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5MEI1MzBELThCRTEtNEVGRi04RDQ1LTM5NDVCRDRBOTNCREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhrNTUwZStodmxnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhrNTUwZStodmxnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":50318,"nextInTopic":50322,"prevInTime":50318,"nextInTime":50320,"topicId":50304,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=Dr. Lustig does a wonderful job of explaining this (and other myths about sugar) in a presentation at UCSF s Mini-Medical School : ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1152823503\">-=Dr. Lustig does a wonderful job of explaining this (and other myths  <br/>\nabout sugar) in a presentation at UCSF&#39;s &quot;Mini-Medical School&quot;:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM</a><br/>\n<br/>\n:-)<br/>\nAndrea-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat video is an hour and a half long.
