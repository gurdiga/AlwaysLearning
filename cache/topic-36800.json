I was curious if <br/>\nfolks who have older girls could give me a little insight into how this <br/>\nphase looked for them and if they found anything that helped keep their <br/>\nrelationship sane during the months (years?) of growth and development <br/>\nthrough the phase.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen it coming, but have tended to attribute the incidents to <br/>\nher being tired or hungry but in the past couple of weeks it has gotten <br/>\nvery intense.  She is very negative, argumentative, she is *mean* to <br/>\nher friends, siblings, grandmother, parents (name calling, hitting, <br/>\nsnatching things away, pushing, yelling), gets very angry about sharing <br/>\nor helping ... it seems so *normal* but the intensity is Wow!  I find <br/>\nmyself saying things that I am ashamed of, I try to be transparent in <br/>\nmy processing of what is happening and walk away when necessary, take <br/>\ndeep breaths, drink a glass of tea or water -- but I don&#39;t know.    <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have talked about it in calmer moments, she doesn&#39;t really like it <br/>\nwhen she gets in that state of mind, but is at a loss for how to draw <br/>\nherself out of it, as am I.  The friend she had over the other day told <br/>\nher mother that she never wanted to come and play with dd again -- this <br/>\nis heartbreaking as they have always been good friends, but inspite of <br/>\nmy atempts throughout the day to help with communication, gentle <br/>\nreminders, and even pulling her aside to have a heart to heart, she was <br/>\njust stuck ( would have called off the playdate but the other girl&#39;s <br/>\nmother was out of town for the day).  We have some bach flower remedies <br/>\nand call them her secret potion, and we put it in her water bottle.  It <br/>\nseems to help a little.  Even I take rescue rememdy when I find myself <br/>\nbeing drawn deeply into an empty conflict, find myself acting like the <br/>\n7 year old girl I must have been.  I know that I have something huge to <br/>\nlearn through my relationship with her, I think that this may be my <br/>\nmoment to step it up.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have looked at the books available through Amazon, and wasn&#39;t <br/>\nthrilled with any of the descriptions or reviews -- any suggestions for <br/>\nreading?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am also feeling anxious about this because DH is feeling like we need <br/>\nto be more punitive.  I found/she led me to Unconditional Parenting <br/>\nbecause punitive wasn&#39;t working with her when we went through a similar <br/>\nphase when she was about 3 or 4 -- so I really can&#39;t imagine that it <br/>\nwould work this time.  I remind him of this, but he wan&#39;t to take away <br/>\nthings, take away playdates, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA break from playdates may be good for her right now, but not as a <br/>\npunishment -- she would notice if I just stopped planning things <br/>\nbecause her siblings would be having things going on and she would be <br/>\nasking about it, I would need to be more consensual and include her in <br/>\nthat conversation (I have already put it out there for her to think <br/>\nabout).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any insight,<br/>\nCathy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35947,"nextTopicId":19885}}
