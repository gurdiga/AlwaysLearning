We&#39;d lived in Albuquerque fro 7 years total, with a few <br/>\nmajor departures.  I never missed it, really, before this time.  <br/>\nThis time we left people we care about.  This time we couldn&#39;t walk <br/>\ndown the street without saying hello to a bunch of people.  This <br/>\ntime we owned the park down the street.  Where we are now has a busy <br/>\nstreet in front of us and no shops nearby.  There isn&#39;t a park <br/>\nwithin walking distance, and we don&#39;t no our neighbors cause they <br/>\naren&#39;t around when we, and there is no place to meet them.  Where we <br/>\nare moving has a park nearby and an almost village center.  We went <br/>\ninto a potters on Saturday and Simon asked if he gave classes.  The <br/>\nman said no, but said if we ever where walking by and saw him <br/>\nthrowing a pot we could stop in and he&#39;d give us a full <br/>\ndemonstration.  He spent a lot of time telling us about the good <br/>\nthings in the community, and about how it is a community.  So, I <br/>\nhave hope.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo we aren&#39;t planning on coming back to the US for more than <br/>\nvisits.  And once we find our place here the pull of the US should <br/>\nlessen.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd thanks so much Shyrley for the e-mail addresses and the lists. I <br/>\nknow now three families I didn&#39;t know who live not to far from us.  <br/>\nWell, we have yet to shake hands, but it is a definite improvement <br/>\non where I was.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s to community.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Shyrley <br/>\n&lt;shyrley.williams@v...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dawn Falbe wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Having been born in England and lived there till 22 I can <br/>\n </span></blockquote>sympathize with<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; what you are going through.

She thinks he&#39;s way to young.  When I<br/>\nsuggested that she could always look into homeschooling, because I&#39;d heard<br/>\nthat people over there did it, she said she was going to look into it, but<br/>\nstarted mentioning teaching him etc.  I tried explaining what we do and I<br/>\ncould hear the confusion in her voice about letting my kids learn at their<br/>\nown pace (speaking of which my 2 boys are in the kitchen right now<br/>\nconcocting some kind of snack for hubby and I - as long as the bleach is<br/>\nlocked up there&#39;s it&#39;s all edible or drinkable - God knows what it will be<br/>\nthough)....  <br/>\n<br/>\nI liked what you said about unschooling and how it works.  Maybe the next<br/>\ntime you go to the committee meeting type of thing you could take that<br/>\ne-mail with you and read out the parts out loud to them all about<br/>\nunschooling and see if you get some positive feedback...
