A child&#39;s life is how they live it. They live in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;immediate present and having to go to school due to the death of a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;parent would be a very significant event. It could definitely add to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;grief.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When my friend Bonnie died, her four kids had never been to school.  Her<br/>\n&gt; husband&#39;s major priority was keeping them out of school.  He took a year or<br/>\n&gt; so and lived on next to nothing while he concentrated on the kids.  Here in<br/>\n&gt; Canada, widows and widowers with kids get a pension until the kids are<br/>\n&gt; grown.  Low income parents also get what they call a child tax benefit.<br/>\n&gt; Between the two, they were able to survive.  Now he works for my husband,<br/>\n&gt; and the 17 year old looks after the boys while he works.  One of the <br/>\n&gt; biggest<br/>\n&gt; things Dennis had to deal with was the kids&#39; fear that he could die as <br/>\n&gt; well.<br/>\n&gt; Tia<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I worry about this for Julian. For those of you who don&#39;t know, he has three <br/>\nparents: Me (biological mother), my partner Beth, and his father, Perry. We <br/>\nhave an excellent relationship with Perry, but the truth is, that if <br/>\nsomething happened to me, whatever Julian needed or Beth wanted, Perry could <br/>\ncall all the shots. I THINK he would want to do what&#39;s best for Julian, <br/>\nincluding NOT sending him to school, but I am not certain. It&#39;s scary. And <br/>\nJulian HAS thought about it, and has talked about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11966,"nextTopicId":12014}}
