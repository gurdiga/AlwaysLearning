But here&#39;s the deal: If she can decide each week whether to go, based on whether it seems more fun, whether it&#39;s alluring, whether she WANTS to go, then the next move is the choir director&#39;s.  If the choir is kind of boring, or the music selections aren&#39;t things worth her getting up and out for, then she shouldn&#39;t go.  It would be a bad idea for her to continue if she comes to dread it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you won&#39;t know that until she goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you tell the director that she&#39;s young and you want her to try it but you aren&#39;t positive she&#39;ll make the whole year, but you&#39;ll help encourage her to do it, that seems to be an honest move on your part.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-How much is too much? -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t know what &quot;too much&quot; is until the moment comes that it&#39;s too much.
