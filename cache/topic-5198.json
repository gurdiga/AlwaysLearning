We could get <br/>\nsome pretty nice materials from the charter school - I got a soil testing kit <br/>\nthat I just stumbled across the other day - we never got around to using it. &lt;<br/>\ng&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there are two reasons for the hostility against the people who join <br/>\npublic programs:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  Most of the people who oppose them think that taking money from the <br/>\ngovernment is pretty close to selling your soul to the devil (for a soil <br/>\ntesting kit? &lt;G&gt;). They are political extremists - opposed to government <br/>\nfunding of education at all. Want to see any government funding of schooling <br/>\nof any kind completely eliminated.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Many also see a slippery slope - they are afraid that someday legislators <br/>\nare going to outlaw any homeschooling except through public schools. They <br/>\nthink that the hsers who enroll in those programs voluntarily are paving the <br/>\nway for that to occur.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike Tia said about her province, it isn&#39;t what we&#39;ve seen in California. We <br/>\nsee many people stepping out of regular school into the public hsing programs <br/>\nand then into independent hsing. I talked to a woman just this morning who is <br/>\nin a public school program and is going to become indepdent after this year. <br/>\nThe public school programs are, to some degree, acting as <br/>\ntransition-to-independent-homeschooling stepping stones. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf they were eliminated, a lot more people would feel stuck in public schools <br/>\nand never make the jump to homeschooling. I know so MANY kids who have been <br/>\nrescued from regular schooling by going into one of the ps programs.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut - again, that argument won&#39;t hold up to people who outschool the schools <br/>\nwith their own kids at home --- they aren&#39;t opposed to schooling, they&#39;re <br/>\nopposed to government funding of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4886,"nextTopicId":5189}}
