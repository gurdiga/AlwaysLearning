He tortured<br/>\nthem, killed them and messed with the bodies.  These<br/>\nboys have serious mental and emotional problems. <br/>\nEither it&#39;s genetics, or they have a secret abuse<br/>\nsomewhere that no one knows about (maybe not even the<br/>\nparents.)  It&#39;s possible that someone hurt the oldest<br/>\nboy (like sexual abuse or something) and he in turn<br/>\npassed the favor on to his younger siblings.  Are<br/>\ntheir parents asleep at the wheel or what?  These kids<br/>\nneed some intervention.  Do them a favor and stir<br/>\nthings up before it&#39;s too late.  They have already<br/>\nmoved on to abusing people.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend FREE Valentine eCards with Yahoo!
