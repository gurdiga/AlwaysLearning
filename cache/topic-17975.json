He didn&#39;t want to touch it<br/>\n  &gt; because he was afraid it would hurt - This coming from a child who<br/>\n  &gt; can skin both knees and barely give a sad look before going back to<br/>\n  &gt; play! I am just so amazed how quickly he is growing up!<br/>\n  &gt; As for being the only child he is very social and had never had<br/>\n  &gt; problems with quickly making friends, there are a lot of schooled<br/>\n  &gt; neighborhood kids who come over after their school as well to play<br/>\n  &gt; for a couple of hours. What we are doing now is that I am also<br/>\n  &gt; caring for a 3 1/2 year old who I have had while his mother works<br/>\n  &gt; since he was a small baby so it&#39;s not like I think my son feels like<br/>\n  &gt; he is even an only sometimes, perhaps on the weekends he feels it<br/>\n  &gt; most, but I don&#39;t think he ever lacks for anything to do or anyone<br/>\n  &gt; to play with, he can always ask me or his dad as well.<br/>\n  &gt; However I am trying to start a school in this area based on the<br/>\n  &gt; Sudbury model which is similar (yet different I know) to<br/>\n  &gt; unschooling, because I see a great need for this type of educational<br/>\n  &gt; situation in my area. But reguardless we are never going to &quot;public<br/>\n  &gt; school&quot; and we are definately unschooling until we get the &quot;school&quot;<br/>\n  &gt; going so I hope I can still get some support here. I just looked<br/>\n  &gt; over the website of a new &quot;Free&quot; school that is starting up in AZ<br/>\n  &gt; and it looks SOOOO nice and they are expecting to keep up paying<br/>\n  &gt; their staff with &quot;donations&quot; - 2 pools and 7 acres to roam... ???<br/>\n  &gt; But I would take kids into our school for really no payment as I am<br/>\n  &gt; lucky enough to have a hubby who pays prettymuch the big bills and<br/>\n  &gt; as long as were not asking for more than food and shelter we&#39;re not<br/>\n  &gt; going into debt... However I&#39;m not sure if I could get the tutors or<br/>\n  &gt; equipment that the kids will ask for from the parents &quot;donations&quot;<br/>\n  &gt; Who knows! I&#39;m rambling anyhow ...
