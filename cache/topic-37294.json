I will tell you that I was buzzing with  <br/>\nexcitement the entire weekend. I made some new friends, learned some  <br/>\nnew things, and my feeling that unschooling is the right path for us  <br/>\nwas absolutely, 100% confirmed (again and again).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I&#39;m going to share the most important nugget of wisdom I found  <br/>\namidst the gold mine of information at the conference. It came from  <br/>\nPam Soorooshian.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the last day of the conference I cornered Pam in the hallway  <br/>\noutside the ballroom where we&#39;d just watched a fabulous slide show of  <br/>\nphotos from the weekend. I&#39;d been dying to ask here one particular  <br/>\nquestion and hadn&#39;t found the opportunity yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I wanted to know was this: &quot;How should I respond to my mother-in- <br/>\nlaw when she says that if Jerry doesn&#39;t have to do some things he  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to do now, he&#39;ll never learn to do the things in life  <br/>\nthat none of us really want to do, but need to get done nonetheless?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWarren&#39;s mom has mentioned her concern about this a few times and I  <br/>\ncould never really answer her because I guess a small part of me  <br/>\nwondered the same thing. I suspected that, just like the rest of us,  <br/>\nhe would do some things he didn&#39;t really want to do because he&#39;d have  <br/>\na conflicting need that would trump his desire to avoid the  <br/>\nunappealing chore. For example, even though I hate washing dishes, I  <br/>\ndo wash them because I hate having dishes piled on my counter even  <br/>\nmore than I hate washing dishes. Pam confirmed that this was true.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen she asked, &quot;Do you really want him doing things he doesn&#39;t want  <br/>\nto do?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWow. When you put it that way I guess I&#39;d have to say no. Not at all.  <br/>\nPam pointed out that she has three girls and she definitely does not  <br/>\nwant her girls feeling obliged to do things they aren&#39;t comfortable  <br/>\nwith. That put a whole new twist on the question.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe suggested asking my mother-in-law, &quot;What is your real concern?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Not being capable of doing things he doesn&#39;t want to do&quot; is very  <br/>\ngeneral. Is she worried that he won&#39;t wash his dishes or clean his  <br/>\nhouse as an adult? That one I can handle.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr is she worried that he won&#39;t have the tenacity to reach his goals?  <br/>\nI have to admit, I&#39;ve asked myself this question, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam pointed out that most of us want our children to find meaningful  <br/>\nwork that they love so they won&#39;t have to do things they don&#39;t want  <br/>\nto do--like go to a job they hate. Yes, they may need to, say, take a  <br/>\njob they aren&#39;t crazy about as a stepping stone to the job of their  <br/>\ndreams, but that&#39;s about seeing the big picture and goal setting-- <br/>\nit&#39;s not being able to do unappealing activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes Jerry see the big picture? Yes, he does. Most of the time. And  <br/>\nwhen he&#39;s unable to see the whole thing Warren and I are there to  <br/>\nfill in the gaps. Is he able to set goals? Pam said he probably does  <br/>\nit all the time with video games. And he does. That&#39;s what video  <br/>\ngames are, right? You set a goal to beat the game and you work at  <br/>\neach level, beating them one by one, until you&#39;ve reached it. Are  <br/>\nvideo game goals the only goals he&#39;s interested in at the moment? No,  <br/>\nbut video games do feature prominently in most of them. He wants to  <br/>\ndesign video games and thanks to a program we discovered this weekend  <br/>\n(more about that later!) he&#39;s well on his way. He wants to build a  <br/>\ngaming computer and we&#39;re darn close to reaching that one (we&#39;ll  <br/>\nstart as soon as we get back home). He wants to beat all four Guitar  <br/>\nHeroes. He does know how to reach goals but they&#39;re his own goals for  <br/>\nhimself. Not mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that tidbit was one of the best things about the conference. I&#39;ll  <br/>\nget to the rest later.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the homecoming front, Jerry and I were supposed to be driving home  <br/>\ntoday but Weird Al Yankovic is playing tonight at the State Fair so  <br/>\nit looks like we&#39;ll be staying one more night--Jerry can&#39;t stand the  <br/>\nthought of missing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never in my life expected to find myself at a Weird Al concert. Ever.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37326,"nextTopicId":37316}}
