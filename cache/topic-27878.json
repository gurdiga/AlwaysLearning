Yesterday, I started to hear the arguments for paedophilia<br/>\n(and there are some) in my head, the arguments of those who think it&#39;s<br/>\noften okay and right for children of all ages to be fully sexually<br/>\nactive - not from watching crime shows either, btw, and I got really<br/>\nangry and wanted to stop the &quot;what if she consented&quot; business in it&#39;s<br/>\ntracks... Which is not where you were coming from, I know. I&#39;m sorry<br/>\nthat my last post on the topic was quite rude, Crystal. It wasn&#39;t<br/>\nabout you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough I have only a good laypersons understanding of all this,<br/>\nevery fibre of my being was screaming on behalf of children who<br/>\nallegedly consented to things they couldn&#39;t possibly have had a full<br/>\nunderstanding of - and I don&#39;t mean to underestimate what children are<br/>\noften capable of (sex aside, I think) when I say that. <br/>\n<br/>\nI simply could not see the child you&#39;ve described Sorscha to be<br/>\nactively consenting to anything really sexual, and wasn&#39;t sure if<br/>\nthat&#39;s where your question, the one I isolated, was going. In my head<br/>\nI saw it horribly misused, if ever answered in the affirmative.<br/>\n<br/>\nI apologise for not keeping a cool head. <br/>\n<br/>\nJo R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Crystal Miller&quot;<br/>\n&lt;willowsfortress@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; If I truly trust Sorscha to make decisions for her self then<br/>\n </span></blockquote>should I be <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; okay if she were to make a decision to kiss this older child?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;I wonder if you still feel like I haven&#39;t answered your question.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *Nope...I&#39;m not sure where that one slipped in AGAIN.
