I was frustrated because when he says he will do  <br/>\nsomething he won&#39;t.  To be fair, the friend who introduced us told me  <br/>\nso early on.  &quot;If he says he&#39;s coming over, don&#39;t expect him.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut still...  I live in hope and all that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo twice so far this weekend he&#39;s not been where he said he&#39;d be, and  <br/>\nit&#39;s a little inconvenient for me, but the bit inconvenience is that  <br/>\nI expected him to be there!<br/>\n<br/>\nI expressed this to Marty, who knows us both well, and he said that  <br/>\nwhen a friend says &quot;I&#39;ll call&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ll come over&quot; and Marty knows  <br/>\nit&#39;s not likely to actually happen, that he says &quot;That would be nice!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s just perfect, and I hope to remember to use it, or at least  <br/>\nthink it. It&#39;s positive and non-committal, and excuses them right up  <br/>\nfront, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31031,"nextTopicId":31040}}
