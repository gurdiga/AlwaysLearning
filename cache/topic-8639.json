So at that time I encourage her to get <br/>\na bedtime snack, brush her teeth etc.  She knows she is tired and does <br/>\nso.  Then we read a few books and I either lie down with her or work on <br/>\nthe computer which is next to the bed.  She sometimes plays for a few <br/>\nminutes and sometimes not, but if there is no other light except the <br/>\ncomputer, she goes to sleep. I don&#39;t say it&#39;s bedtime exactly, i just <br/>\nmake sleep happen for her in a way I know works.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Lexie, I don&#39;t do a thing.  I occassionally fail because I will say <br/>\n&quot;JUST GO TO SLEEP!&quot; because it&#39;s 1am and I&#39;m tired and trying to get <br/>\nsome work done.  But mostly I just let her stay up.  Usually between 11 <br/>\nand 1, we read whatever book I&#39;m reading aloud to her and then I turn <br/>\noff my light and go to sleep.  She sometiems follows suit but sometimes <br/>\ngoes into the other room to read.  I dont&#39; worry about her, she&#39;s 7.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\nkayb85 wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Ok, I have another question.
