So, putting us back to <br/>\nback early in the conference would probably be ideal so folks can have a <br/>\nchance to look for the letterbox throughout the conference.<br/>\n<br/>\nLetterbox Funshop: Great for families and young children, letterboxing <br/>\nis an outdoor treasure-hunt adventure with a creative twist in its <br/>\nhand-carved stamps. Begun in Dartmoor, England, in 1854, letterboxing <br/>\nhas evolved into part hike, part puzzle, part art. Popularized in <br/>\nAmerica by a 1998 _Smithsonian_ article, North American Letterboxing has <br/>\ngrown over the past decade and a half to an estimated 5000 boxes <br/>\nscattered across the country. We&#39;ll talk about the history and ethics of <br/>\nletterboxing, box placement, stamp and clue design, and how to get <br/>\nstarted this weekend with our very own Live and Learn St. Louis letterbox!<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you need the bio and picture stuff from me again? Would you like a <br/>\ndifferent bio that focuses more on our letterbox stuff with links, etc.?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, you expressed interest in having me conduct a web-based <br/>\ndocumentation funshop, which would probably also be an hour. Are you <br/>\nstill interested in having me do that? If so, I&#39;ll work up a quick <br/>\ndescription.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~Danielle<br/>\nEmily (7), Julia (6), Sam (4.5)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;With our thoughts, we make the world.&quot; ~~Buddha</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Live & Learn funshop presenters","postDate":"1113999169","msgId":22051,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDNzEzQjk2NzlFRkM3Ny1FMzgtNEM3M0NAbWJsay1yMTQuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":22053,"prevInTime":22050,"nextInTime":22052,"topicId":22051,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m finalizing website pages---well *starting* to *begin* website pages for funshop presenters.
