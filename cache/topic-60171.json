Older people don&#39;t often think of homeschooling when they see kids out during the day, they think, &quot;truant.&quot;    And for older people, especially, if a person seems to be neglecting their house and yard and then their kids are outside making noise during school hours, well that starts to look like a pattern of neglect.   Shovel your sidewalks.  Clean your house.  Have a neighbor over for coffee. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: protecting ourselves","postDate":"1299252868","msgId":60185,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk1N0JFNDMzLTA4OUQtNEQ2Ny04MDE3LTlFQjNGM0IwMDE5RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlrcXZyMitic29lQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlrcXZyMitic29lQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":60183,"nextInTopic":60186,"prevInTime":60184,"nextInTime":60186,"topicId":60171,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Start a blog and keep it updated.
