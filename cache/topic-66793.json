It&#39;s already taken me a few days to get through the replies to my last post. I probably won&#39;t remember everything that I wanted to respond to. My email isn&#39;t quoting what I&#39;m replying to in this group and I haven&#39;t figured out why yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t mention him coming and going because we thought he was home for at least a year. Him getting orders to leave again was very sudden and unexpected. I was (am) a bit angry and frustrated about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe does get reintegration classes and seminars are available for spouses and children as well. We took a couple of weeks to let him ease into things. He&#39;s really good at sitting back and watching for a while, not immediately trying to be in charge. I do think there are some issues with him being used to giving orders and having them unquestionably followed at work, especially when he&#39;s been immersed only in the military lifestyle for so long, and then switching to family mode. We&#39;ve talked about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHe likes to cook dinner and wanted to do bedtime with the boys. Those weren&#39;t things that I pushed on him and I didn&#39;t initially try to tell him how to do it. It was only after several days of them having trouble that I tried to help. I agree that my wording probably could have been better. I don&#39;t really remember exactly what I said to him. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would love for us to go to a conference. I&#39;ve been trying to get to one for years but he has always been gone. This was supposed to be our year home together followed by another 2-3 years with him in a non-deployable job.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nAlysia<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: When your partner does things differently","postDate":"1334704495","msgId":66820,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0MzI3QjJDLThGNDEtNEJGMS1BMzQ0LTUwNjhDOTczQkVDNUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGptaW5laitvbjg2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGptaW5laitvbjg2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":66806,"nextInTopic":66823,"prevInTime":66819,"nextInTime":66821,"topicId":66793,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-In the Navy they offer classes on the ships for service members to coach them on how to reintegrate back into family life after being deployed.

He was only home for about a month after a year in Afghanistan. Anyway, here are the two main examples that came up while he was home.<br/>\n<br/>\nFood, of course. He wanted everyone sit down together for dinner. That&#39;s fine with me. I like that. But, he tried to insist that the boys eat a certain amount of almost everything he made. Interestingly, he was most pushy about the protein/meat than the veggies whereas I am more likely to make more effort to get the boys to eat vaggies. He would get angry if the boys didn&#39;t eat everything or at least some of each thing. He would put way too much food on their plates, though, as far as I was concerned. I offered to help but he wanted to do it all. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe looks at me while he&#39;s supposedly talking to the boys about what he wants them to do and why. He&#39;s looking to me to back him up but I don&#39;t really want to get into power struggles with them over eating 3 bites of chicken or whatever. Eventually, he got so frustrated by it that he quit doing anything. It went from him piling food on their plates and trying to make them eat it all to him not even bothering to give them anything. I did tell him at other times that he was putting too much food on their plates, especially the 4 year old&#39;s. I&#39;ve told him the same thing about my plate. He finally came to accept that I would make my own plate but <br/>\nhe can&#39;t seem to get there with the boys.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night he made chicken soup and asked me if I wanted to call the boys in for dinner or if we should just let them play. I said that I didn&#39;t really care because I knew they&#39;d eat eventually. He didn&#39;t say anything else about it and didn&#39;t even tell the boys that dinner was ready. I did holler outside to them that dinner was ready and they came in to eat. I didn&#39;t tell them they had to, just that it was ready. I don&#39;t understand why my husband doesn&#39;t (can&#39;t?) do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBedtime was another thing he wanted to do. He wanted to get the boys ready for bed while I took care of the baby. He would go upstairs with them around 9 and was supposed to be getting them to brush their teeth and maybe read some books or whatever and get them settled into bed before I came up with the baby. I&#39;d wait an hour and go up (because the baby is a late nighter) and the boys would still be bouncing off the walls, no teeth brushed, nothing. My husband would be standing in the middle of the room repeatedly yelling at them to brush their teeth but not really doing anything about it. He would get more and more frustrated and angry that they weren&#39;t doing what he said. Sometimes one or the other would be crying. It was just awful and certainly not a peaceful way to try to get the baby to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told my husband numerous times that, especially with the 4 year old, he had to actively engage with him to get him to do things. If you want him to brush his teeth, gently take him into the bathroom, hand him his toothbrush and stand there with him while he brushes. Maybe even brush your own teeth at the same time. Sitting on the edge of the bed watching ESPN while peripherally yelling at him to brush his teeth just isn&#39;t going to work. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe 8 year old will do it if you give him options, like waiting for the next commercial or until he&#39;s done reading the page or whatever he&#39;s doing but he sometimes needs to be reminded. My husband wouldn&#39;t allow for that. He just expected him to do it as soon as he was told regardless of what else he might be doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I offered to do it but my husband wanted to. He&#39;d been gone a long time and he wanted to get back  into taking care of the kids like that. I want to support that but it&#39;s hard when he&#39;s doing things that I don&#39;t agree with. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe is an academic unschooler, too. It took a few years but he now truly believes in unschooling academics because he&#39;s had time to see how it works with our kids. He can&#39;t seem to make that leap to the rest of life. I don&#39;t think he knows or understands much about how young children behave. He only knows how they are expected to behave. So, any time they do anything that is deemed unacceptable (and embarrasses him in public), like crying because he doesn&#39;t buy them a candy bar at the store, he thinks it&#39;s because radical unschooling is too permissive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve tried to show him but he&#39;s not home enough to see how things started and may have changed.

He was only home for about a month after a year in Afghanistan. Anyway, here are the two main examples that came up while he was home.<br/>\n<br/>\nFood, of course. He wanted everyone sit down together for dinner. That&#39;s fine with me. I like that. But, he tried to insist that the boys eat a certain amount of almost everything he made. Interestingly, he was most pushy about the protein/meat than the veggies whereas I am more likely to make more effort to get the boys to eat vaggies. He would get angry if the boys didn&#39;t eat everything or at least some of each thing. He would put way too much food on their plates, though, as far as I was concerned. I offered to help but he wanted to do it all. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHe looks at me while he&#39;s supposedly talking to the boys about what he wants them to do and why. He&#39;s looking to me to back him up but I don&#39;t really want to get into power struggles with them over eating 3 bites of chicken or whatever. Eventually, he got so frustrated by it that he quit doing anything. It went from him piling food on their plates and trying to make them eat it all to him not even bothering to give them anything. I did tell him at other times that he was putting too much food on their plates, especially the 4 year old&#39;s. I&#39;ve told him the same thing about my plate. He finally came to accept that I would make my own plate but <br/>\nhe can&#39;t seem to get there with the boys.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night he made chicken soup and asked me if I wanted to call the boys in for dinner or if we should just let them play. I said that I didn&#39;t really care because I knew they&#39;d eat eventually. He didn&#39;t say anything else about it and didn&#39;t even tell the boys that dinner was ready. I did holler outside to them that dinner was ready and they came in to eat. I didn&#39;t tell them they had to, just that it was ready. I don&#39;t understand why my husband doesn&#39;t (can&#39;t?) do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBedtime was another thing he wanted to do. He wanted to get the boys ready for bed while I took care of the baby. He would go upstairs with them around 9 and was supposed to be getting them to brush their teeth and maybe read some books or whatever and get them settled into bed before I came up with the baby. I&#39;d wait an hour and go up (because the baby is a late nighter) and the boys would still be bouncing off the walls, no teeth brushed, nothing. My husband would be standing in the middle of the room repeatedly yelling at them to brush their teeth but not really doing anything about it. He would get more and more frustrated and angry that they weren&#39;t doing what he said. Sometimes one or the other would be crying. It was just awful and certainly not a peaceful way to try to get the baby to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told my husband numerous times that, especially with the 4 year old, he had to actively engage with him to get him to do things. If you want him to brush his teeth, gently take him into the bathroom, hand him his toothbrush and stand there with him while he brushes. Maybe even brush your own teeth at the same time. Sitting on the edge of the bed watching ESPN while peripherally yelling at him to brush his teeth just isn&#39;t going to work. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 8 year old will do it if you give him options, like waiting for the next commercial or until he&#39;s done reading the page or whatever he&#39;s doing but he sometimes needs to be reminded. My husband wouldn&#39;t allow for that. He just expected him to do it as soon as he was told regardless of what else he might be doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I offered to do it but my husband wanted to. He&#39;d been gone a long time and he wanted to get back  into taking care of the kids like that. I want to support that but it&#39;s hard when he&#39;s doing things that I don&#39;t agree with. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is an academic unschooler, too. It took a few years but he now truly believes in unschooling academics because he&#39;s had time to see how it works with our kids. He can&#39;t seem to make that leap to the rest of life. I don&#39;t think he knows or understands much about how young children behave. He only knows how they are expected to behave. So, any time they do anything that is deemed unacceptable (and embarrasses him in public), like crying because he doesn&#39;t buy them a candy bar at the store, he thinks it&#39;s because radical unschooling is too permissive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve tried to show him but he&#39;s not home enough to see how things started and may have changed. I&#39;ve tried explaining it to him but he won&#39;t accept it. I email him things to read (like Sandra&#39;s links) and ask him to read books on have, not just on unschooling but also on child development and behavior. He says he doesn&#39;t have time and that everything I give him supports my position but he doesn&#39;t make an effort to learn about anything else.<br/>\n <br/>\nAlysia<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66657,"nextTopicId":66826}}
