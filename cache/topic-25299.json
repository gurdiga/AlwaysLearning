I choose to go but really had no interest in what was in the <br/>\nstore.  It was BOREING!  and it really made me think about how my kids <br/>\nfeel when they come say shoe shopping with me.  If you have NOTHING to <br/>\ndo in the store and the person who is doing the shopping is jsut busy <br/>\nshopping you are left.  So if your are having a hard time remembering <br/>\nwhat it&#39;s like to be in that situation (and that is pretty much the <br/>\nsituation most kids are in when you see them out shopping)  Try it you <br/>\nwill be more interactive with your kids next time and when you see <br/>\nother kids out &quot;shopping&quot; give them a smile and try with them too!<br/>\n<br/>\nlearning all the time!<br/>\njean</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25248,"nextTopicId":25294}}
