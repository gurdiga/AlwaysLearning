Perfectionists <br/>\nare people who have been molded by parental pressure. These people <br/>\nhave learned to perform to standards other people have set.  They <br/>\nhave a very difficult time feeling satisfaction with their lives <br/>\nbecause they are striving to reach someone elses goals.<br/>\n<br/>\n*I* had a difficult day today.  I run a sign language club where we <br/>\nplay games to learn sign language.  More people showed up for the <br/>\nmeeting than I had planned for so the games had to be modified.  It <br/>\nwas not perfect. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat could have been a very enjoyable afternoon with other <br/>\nhomeschoolers was very stressful for no reason other than my <br/>\nperfectionism. I decided to do some research and see if I could get <br/>\nsome pointers on how to reduce my stress.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I found after doing a search on Google was helpful and very <br/>\ninteresting.  Most of the sights on the first page of the search were <br/>\nfrom Universities.  The information was for their students struggling <br/>\nwith perfectionism.  It appears perfectionism is a problem for <br/>\ncollege students.  I wonder why? (rhetorical question)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone struggling with perfectionist tendencies or questioning <br/>\nwhether children *need* parental pressure might enjoy reading a <br/>\ncommencement speech by Anna Quindlen at the following address:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mtholyoke.edu/offices/comm/oped/Quindlen.shtml\">http://www.mtholyoke.edu/offices/comm/oped/Quindlen.shtml</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAre we as parents willing to risk turning our children into <br/>\nperfectionists in order to give them some future advantage that they <br/>\nthemselves have not decided they want?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think all children need is parental *insight* and support. I hope I <br/>\ncan offer this to my children without them feeling any pressure.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is difficult for me because as a perfectionist I worry about <br/>\nwhat other people will think I should be doing.  I also have a <br/>\ntendency to want everyone to achieve to my overly high standards.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPat</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"parental pressure","postDate":"1019572622","msgId":6397,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE2OS5jOGJkYjVjLjI5ZjZjYjhlQGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":6398,"prevInTime":6396,"nextInTime":6398,"topicId":6397,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/23/02 12:56:41 AM Central Daylight Time, AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-736973697\">In a message dated 4/23/02 12:56:41 AM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; If a person wants to take a class, he or she will set an alarm and get <br/>\nthere. <br/>\n  The more they want to take it, the more likely they&#39;ll arrange their lives <br/>\n around it.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have found this to be true over and over again!!  My 12yo ds got a radio/CD <br/>\nplayer for Christmas with a built in alarm.  I never even showed him how to <br/>\nuse it, but it gets used quite often because he is a late night person and <br/>\nwants to get up in the morning for various reasons.<br/>\nA few years ago he borrowed an alarm to help him get to a neighbors house on <br/>\ntime because she was paying him to help out around her yard.  I never <br/>\nreminded him what time he&#39;d have to be there, or how dissapointed she might <br/>\nbe if he weren&#39;t on time.<br/>\nThe whole idea to get the job had been his, he worked out the payment <br/>\narrangement with her and the motivation to get there was strong.<br/>\nShe hired him several times over that year before we moved into town, because <br/>\nhe was entirely dependable and worked hard.<br/>\nIt is totally natural for humans to desire wages and access to the world <br/>\nthrough work.<br/>\nAssisting my kids in finding something they love to do is not a worry for me <br/>\nat all.<br/>\nI know that all my work experiences had NOTHING to do with my years in HS. <br/>\nNot one class I took, not one test, not one iota of anything I did there <br/>\naffected a single job I&#39;ve had since then.<br/>\nThat isn&#39;t true for everyone. But it does make a person question the sanity <br/>\nof &quot;preparing&quot; a 16 y.o. for a vocation.<br/>\nI had no clue what I wanted to do with my life then.<br/>\nI still change my mind quite a bit.<br/>\nMotivation/desire is the only way to true success in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.students.mcneese.edu/lc1374/\">http://www.students.mcneese.edu/lc1374/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a link to a webpage about an unschooler that learned her <br/>\nmultiplication tables for the purpose of making the college entrance exam <br/>\neasier on herself.<br/>\nShe took higher level math and excelled at college....she has graduated now <br/>\nand with almost a 4.0 grade average.<br/>\nI only put this here to encourage anyone with questions about &quot;preparing&quot; <br/>\nchildren to see another side of this.<br/>\nI think it is shortsighted to think we can help impart a body of knowledge <br/>\nthat they will use for life.<br/>\nDesire will help them seek any knowledge they need....and our job then, as it <br/>\nis now, is to be an avenue to the information they need.<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6385,"nextTopicId":6376}}
