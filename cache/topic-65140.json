No information sets kids up to be powerless and helpless. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow much do You talk with your kids about finances? I don&#39;t mean dump on them, but do you let them know you need to cut back expenses and may need to move to a smaller house as part of that? Have you brought them into the process a little so they feel like they have some &quot;say&quot; in what&#39;s going on and can help brainstorm?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;he thinks it&#39;s totally right to tell them about it, that they need to know about reality and that they are old enough to deal with it.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nTo an extent, he&#39;s right, even if he&#39;s going a bit overboard in what and how he&#39;s telling them - but that very fact makes me think you&#39;re not saying/doing enough. It&#39;s common for one parent to try and overcompensate for what he or she sees as flaws in the other. Look for ways to meet him half way. Kids don&#39;t need All the doom and gloom, but they do need to learn how to live in the world. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How can I make him understand, that it is bad for their developpement<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is? <br/>\nI&#39;m poor. My kids are poor. They know it, and have known it since they were pretty little. It doesn&#39;t make for a sad, pathetic life, it means we sometimes need to do some extra brainstorming and look for creative way to get what we want. It means they ask about finances at times and want to be involved in decisions which affect them - not all the gory details! but they don&#39;t want to be out of the loop, either. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He had a very tough childhood, with constant talk about money and brutal violence from his mother.

Do what you can to make his life more pleasant and less stressful. Would moving to a smaller house or apartment help that, do you think? It might be a good idea to ask him. What does He think y&#39;all need to do about your finances? Make sure he feels like you&#39;re listening to his concerns, not just sweeping them under the rug, la la la! it&#39;s a pretty day!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the kids aren&#39;t happy being home with them, look for ways to bring them along with you. Have they been unhappy with him for the whole six years? If not, what&#39;s changed? Can you make life sweeter and more pleasant again for all of them? Make all of you a team again instead of mom-and-kids versus the big blue meany?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;we spend more then we make<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Are you spending a lot On The Kids and that&#39;s part of his resentment? That&#39;s something to consider. He might be feeling like everyone&#39;s getting a piece of the pie but him, like all y&#39;all&#39;s peace and freedom is bought with his pain and suffering. Do you let him know you&#39;re grateful for all he does? Fill him up with appreciation and affection on a regular basis so he knows he&#39;s important to you. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":357566737,"authorName":"Christina Chaffin","from":"&quot;Christina Chaffin&quot; &lt;rcchaffin@...&gt;","profile":"rcchaffin","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: leaving no hope","postDate":"1327240689","msgId":65152,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpmaDRsaCtoZnVmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEQ4M0Y5MjFDLTg4MTEtNEE1NC04M0I3LTJCRjlCNjE5ODY0MkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":65150,"nextInTopic":65153,"prevInTime":65151,"nextInTime":65153,"topicId":65140,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sorry to pick this as my first post, but please... be more attentive and nurturing ??

Yes, they do realize when something is going on, but they do not need to be told every detail. More importantly, is the idea that he is doing this behind your back.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am speaking from personal experience. My husband and I had severe financial problems early in our marriage and were even homeless for a short period of time (lived in a cheap motel). He was my second husband and felt personally responsible for our problems. My oldest son was 13 and we tried to keep as much as we could from him leading up to us having to move. In fact, I had him spend as much time as possible with my mother and he lived with her while we were in the motel. I was trying to keep his life as normal as possible. He is now 22 and remembers some of the details, but it did not &quot;damage&quot; him in any way, nor did he ever think he was even remotely to blame. I am thankful he never knew how bad things had been (my mother helped shield him from some details), and also that my now almost 10 year old son was only a baby at the time. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I had good jobs, and then my disability from a high risk pregnancy followed by his work place accident, that left us fighting with workers comp for more than a year, completely changed our lives in the blink of an eye. We were extremely stressed and worried daily on how we would survive, while trying to parent my son and our new baby. I remember getting in the shower on numerous occasions and crying until I was spent- the only place I could do this without my son hearing. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy point...finally :) ... is that your husband needs to be stronger and discuss his concerns with you or another adult, but not your children. I&#39;m sorry, but I think his jealously over their lifestyle is a driving force behind his need to include them in all the messy details. I would confront him with his secrets and tell him your children are off limits when it comes to his need to discuss your financial problems. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot ment to offend... just my humble opinion from someone whose has been there.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, my husband and I survived and our marriage is stronger than ever. Financially we are strong, my oldest will graduate from college in June, and our youngest loves being homeschooled. <br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nChris<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; On Jan 22, 2012, at 3:53 AM, angela.schwickert wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; But last night I spoke to him again and he thinks it&#39;s totally<br/>\n&gt; &gt; right to tell them about it, that they need to know about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reality and that they are old enough to deal with it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; No, I disagree, cause they are kids and they can&#39;t do anything<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about it, which leaves them with guilt and fear and hopelessness.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There can be a middle ground of giving them enough information -- like saying that finances are tight at the moment -- to help them make better decisions.

Take them with you to run errands. If he is feeling the need to share out his misery, give him less opportunity. Don&#39;t make a big deal about it, just do it.

If he is feeling envious of how nicely these two children lives are, work to make his life better. Bring him something nice to eat while he&#39;s working. Bring him something nice to do when you are out. Make an effort to touch him kindly when you pass him by in the house. Work to make his home life feel better even if his financial life is feeling stressful. Be appreciative of what he does do for you and your children. Be appreciative of what he offers and what he shares and don&#39;t ask for more. Recognise that stepparent is a different role to parent and don&#39;t expect him to feel the same way about your children as you do. Give him space and love and generosity.

First they didn&#39;t want to tell me, they said they were not allowed too from their step father (since six years he is the stepfather).<br/>\nI was shocked and promised them, not to tell him anything about what they would tell me. Then they opened up about it all and they were so glad, they could talk about it! He said, he didn&#39;t want them to tell me, cause it would be too much for me (oh, but not for them? They are 11 and 14 !).The real reason is, that he worries a lot at the moment about our financial situation but can&#39;t bear that we are positiv and strong (mentally) about it. He is in a little stessful situation and needs to constanly talk about it. <br/>\nHe took away hope from my kids with telling them, we would have to sell the house. This is so terrible (and not true ) .The kids told me, he told them all details about income and costs and that we spend more then we make etc. This is true and we work on it like most people on this planet. They said he often would complain about the money when I am gone and pleased me to make, that he stops with that.<br/>\nI tried to talk to him about putting too much weight on kids with sharing grown up problems with them in a way, that makes them feel guilty and hopeless, not saying one word about what I promised the kids, just using the daily examples he gives the kids, constantly talking about money and costs.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t see what he does to the kids, who both were crying at me, when they told me what he told them. Also that we would be poor! (with a pretty good income!)<br/>\nHe also doen&#39;t understand the damage, he causes with saying that. <br/>\nThey felt so hopeless and bad. I stabilized them as good as I can. But last night I spoke to him again and he thinks it&#39;s totally right to tell them about it, that they need to know about reality and that they are old enough to deal with it.<br/>\nNo, I disagree, cause they are kids and they can&#39;t do anything about it, which leaves them with guilt and fear and hopelessness.<br/>\nI told them, cause he works from home, he abuses them in these moments as a partner, to get rid of his own frustrations, with whom he can&#39;t deal. <br/>\nWhat shall I do? How can I make him understand? He seems so stubbern about that it is right to confront them with our problems and does it &#39;secretly&#39;, not understanding, what that means to the kids and me. <br/>\nHow can I make him see? (move out..;-)<br/>\nHow can I make him understand, that it is bad for their developpement, that they can get depressed. It is already dificult for them, that their father broke of every contact, cause of depression.<br/>\nI love my man but I can&#39;t just ignor what is going on but also don&#39;t reach anything when I try to expand his way of thinking. He just says, they should know about the facts of life.<br/>\nHe had a very tough childhood, with constant talk about money and brutal violence from his mother.
