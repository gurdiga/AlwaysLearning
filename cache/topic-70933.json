I remember comments like that from when I was a schoolgirl, decades ago - about kids who had to check in, girls who couldn&#39;t wear make-up and shorts skirts, that sort of thing. The &quot;right answer&quot; in school circles is to then complain about how horrible one&#39;s parents are and plot ways around them. That might be useful information to pass on to your daughter, that if she wants to blend in a bit more, she could complain about &quot;having to&quot; check in with you. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;she <br/>\n&gt; would rather be  inside drawing or on the computer or doing something with <br/>\n&gt; me <br/>\n&gt; than playing  with these children who knock for her after school <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If she doesn&#39;t want to play and doesn&#39;t want to hurt their feelings, she can say she has to do homeschool right now - she didn&#39;t get her work done in time. Again, that makes her seem a little more &quot;normal&quot; in the eyes of other kids - not the homeschool part, but the fact that she&#39;d be expected to finish school work before playing with friends. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;a lot of them dont  &quot;get&quot; what unschooling <br/>\n&gt; is and think that &quot;homeschooling&quot; is a luxury we have  taken because I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; not <br/>\n&gt; working. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And they&#39;re right - homeschooling Is a luxury and unschooling even more so. There are places it&#39;s not possible, places it&#39;s not legal.

I would imagine she&#39;s learning a ton of life lessons in being a part of this divorce and watching you become an advocate for yourself.  As long as you are able to maintain an upbeat, fun attitude about it I can imagine the two of you having lots of fun finding creative ways to save money and have fun on a small budget.  I grew up without a lot of money and I was fortunate that my parents were pretty creative and we didn&#39;t feel deprived for the most part (of physical pleasures, definitely longed for love and attention).  That creativity came out of a need to stretch a dollar but it is a gift that still permeates my life.  There is a sense of power and contentedness from  knowing how to survive on a budget and from making your own things, whether that be graham crackers, clothing and accessories, finding something that other people think is garbage and giving it new life or whatever.  I remember my parents saving old candles and melting down the wax to make colorful new ones.  I remember having a sense of wonder and excitement when looking at that box of old candles.  What kind of wonderful creations would we make from those raw materials?  There is a reality show called &quot;Dirty Money&quot; where two NYC brothers take street finds and discarded items and give them the most amazing new lives.  There are some scenes here:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dsc.discovery.com/tv-shows/other-shows/videos/dirty-money-cart-for-sale.htm&lt;http://dsc.discovery.com/tv-shows/other-shows/videos/dirty-money-cart-for-sale.htm\">http://dsc.discovery.com/tv-shows/other-shows/videos/dirty-money-cart-for-sale.htm&lt;http://dsc.discovery.com/tv-shows/other-shows/videos/dirty-money-cart-for-sale.htm</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a people pleaser myself and I do not feel like I have a responsibility to share the details of our lives with other people.  I don&#39;t feel like I have the strength or confidence to announce to folks &quot;Hey we&#39;re doing something different over here!&quot; cuz most folks find that to be very threatening to their own status quo.  99% of the time when it comes up I just tell people that we homeschool.  Most people get an overwhelmed look in their eyes just thinking about the idea and they do not want to hear more.  People have a preconceived idea of what homeschooling is so I just let them make that assumption.  Only one time have I been pressed for more information and that was at an event at a friend&#39;s house when two moms cornered me and asked how it was going.  I like both of the women and consider them friends so I felt comfortable to open up to them.  The main thing they wanted to know was &quot;do they listen to you?&quot;.  When I said &quot;no&quot; and explained that we are taking a different approach you could see the relief in both mom&#39;s eyes.  What they were really saying to me was &quot;I can&#39;t make my children mind me and I&#39;m going to feel like an utter failure if you tell me that you have.&quot;  I explained to them a bit about the unschooling philosophy and they both felt reassured that there was no secret way I had stumbled onto to make the children obedient.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I would say have fun with your daughter and try not to get drawn into detailed conversations about unschooling with people.  I portray an air of &quot;this is working for us, we are happy and we are not soliciting opinions on the matter&quot;.  It&#39;s easy for me to portray that because that&#39;s how I feel.  The more I believe in myself, my instincts and my ability to take care of my family the stronger I feel within myself.  Let your daughter&#39;s laughter and joy wash over you like a healing balm and take pride in knowing that you have given her the opportunity to feel that sense of safety and happiness.  You have a lot to be proud of!!  And lots and lots of great memory making opportunities ahead of you!<br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck,<br/>\nCass<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: a new &#39;democratic&#39; school, & influences & fears","postDate":"1363660520","msgId":71019,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZEMzAxRjVGLTdBRUQtNDI2QS1BNjg3LUQ0ODBBOTI1QzI5NkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDU3NGEuMjdmNjlmY2MuM2U3OTBlMWZAYW9sLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDU3NGEuMjdmNjlmY2MuM2U3OTBlMWZAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":71018,"nextInTopic":71020,"prevInTime":71018,"nextInTime":71020,"topicId":70933,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I agree, ever since children have started being given cell phones, my own included, there are unwritten rules to follow.  -=- If you think of it as being","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2071857232\">-=-I agree, ever since children have started being given cell <br/>\nphones, my own included, there are unwritten rules to follow.  -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you think of it as being courteous and considerate, it&#39;s not about rules.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-All parents of  any orientation may talk with their children about this. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAny parent who has not talked to a child about phone courtesy shouldn&#39;t be letting the child use a phone.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I even knew as a  child when i got a private line for my room. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nKnew that there was etiquette involved?

I feel the resentment building up and even sometimes dreading  <br/>\nstepping outside to have to engage in a discussion at the elevator our the  <br/>\ncurb. <br/>\nBut i realize that these things will happen whether i see the people  or <br/>\nnot, and its how we conduct ourselves as pointed out in other posts about  <br/>\nrespecting time schedules and so forth. Homeschoolers support <br/>\ngroups-check.,  <br/>\nUnschoolers support group-check. Single parents support groups, only child  <br/>\nsupport groups, divorced parents playgroups, check check check, lol. <br/>\nReading  <br/>\nthrough here, and other places similar always help me renew my confidence  <br/>\nin what we chose and are doing. <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree and they truly dont know how  happy my daughter is. They are only <br/>\nseeing one side of her amongst the  schooled kids on the street who think <br/>\nher <br/>\nmanners, her responsible way she  calls me to go over or inside someones <br/>\nhouse or to let me know if she&#39;s  using a scooter or a bike and to where so <br/>\ni <br/>\ncan see her out the door or  window is being a baby who has no social <br/>\nskills. <br/>\nOne girl the same age  called her &quot;pathetic that you have to let your mom <br/>\nknow&quot;. For some reason  this is seen this way and i&#39;m not sure why. Yet i <br/>\nreally have seen from  experience not to tell these moms what to do about <br/>\ntheir <br/>\nown daughter&#39;s  attitudes, because people dont like it or in some cases <br/>\nwill break out a  baseball bat, lol. We never like to hear what we are <br/>\ndoing <br/>\nwrong with our  children, but I am confident that my child&#39;s social skills <br/>\nwill keep her  safe and attract good people as she gets older. Like me, she <br/>\nwould rather be  inside drawing or on the computer or doing something with <br/>\nme <br/>\nthan playing  with these children who knock for her after school then their <br/>\nmothers have  an opinion of her. <br/>\n<br/>\nI like the comments you offered me to say back. Thank  you very helpful to <br/>\nbe armed with as well as ideas to keep in mind as to why  people are saying <br/>\nonly what they know not really knowing their children. I&#39;m  not mentioning <br/>\nof <br/>\ncourse the other half of parents who always say &quot;oh we  love having her <br/>\nover, she&#39;s so good, she&#39;s the most well behaved girl who  comes over&quot; or <br/>\nsuch <br/>\nstuff. I just say thank you. But a lot of them dont  &quot;get&quot; what unschooling <br/>\nis and think that &quot;homeschooling&quot; is a luxury we have  taken because I&#39;m <br/>\nnot <br/>\nworking. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut to answer your question, my  daughter does get stressed out when she <br/>\nhears these questions or comments,  but about going out? no, we usually <br/>\npick <br/>\nwhat we want to do if an exhibit or  convention comes to town. We LOVE <br/>\nHarry <br/>\nPotter, the books and movies, so we  love to frequent the exhibit and hang <br/>\nout there always seeing new things.  (Its one of the things in New York <br/>\nright <br/>\nnow) and we enjoy the train rides  together as well, talking or reading <br/>\ntogether, walking through the city,  here or new York, if there&#39;s a time we <br/>\nget <br/>\nbored of it, we go home.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFunny i find myself explaining to you, in hopes to give you more insight  <br/>\nbut yet wondering if i do these these things with outside strangers.  <br/>\nBullying <br/>\nis something that can happen in or out of school. To parents and  children <br/>\nalike.

That might be enough for me, honestly.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI got a phone call at 10:30 Saturday night.  It scared me, because Holly and Marty were both out driving in the desert in other states.  It said Pam Sorooshian.  That still worried me, and there was nobody there by the time I fumbled with the phone.  (I was in bed, but not asleep.)   I called Pam back and she said she had left her phone somewhere, and the person who found it was trying to call the last number called when she got back.  I guess they would&#39;ve said &quot;your friend left her phone here,&quot; and I would&#39;ve called one of her daughters, or her home phone.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat same night, at 12:05, the house phone rang.  The one in our room is LOUD.  It&#39;s an old dial phone.  It was Holly. She and Will were okay, but I didn&#39;t know that for the first minute or two Keith was talking to her.  They were stuck in sand in the Mojave, off on a dirt road.  They were trying to get roadside assistance out there.  Keith was groggy and not being very helpful at first.  I, on the other hand, was filled with fearful adrenaline and hardly slept the rest of the night.<br/>\n<br/>\nHad either of those calls been a child wanting to speak to another child (especially one long asleep who had school the next day), it would have been a major irritation for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I had spoken with my daughter about not calling schooled friends <br/>\nafter a certain time and to even find out what everyone&#39;s phone time <br/>\nis...-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou asked HER to find out?  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s too much responsibility for her.  You should be calling instead and arranging play dates, not letting a very young child make phone calls like that, I think.  Unless you know the family VERY well, they shouldn&#39;t need to interact with your daughter directly, nor with ANYone after their child&#39;s bedtime.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMake a guess based on general practices.  Teens probably are in bed at 10:00, and youngest kids by 8:00 or so.  Don&#39;t treat it case-by-case.

Without their own little things building their own big picture, they can find themselves trying to live someone else&#39;s big picture, not really understanding why, unable to *know* that it makes sense or to feel confident about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care to bring a peaceful, mindful attitude to as many moments as you can.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTake more time to really see and get to know your daughter.  What does your daughter love to do?, what makes her light up with joy?, what does she talk about at night when all is quiet?  Can you help her explore those things, help her feel delight and joy many times a day.  If she has lived with a lot of chaos, it will help if you listen sensitively, as she begins to become more aware of her own feelings and desires.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing well-connected to our children is a fundamental starting point to unschooling.

If you can follow up with a question about what they are doing in their life, it may be sufficiently distracting.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor someone persistent, or someone who thinks they know a lot about education and learning, I have said things like: &quot;Our personalized curriculum is - or We use - an integrated, highly vocational, individualized learning program that facilitates skills acquisition through deep focus on interests and passions.

Respect and mindfulness can go a long way with neighbors and friends, just as it does with kids :-) -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nDisrespect and carelessness doesn&#39;t go far, though, and it can&#39;t easily be undone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a friendship isn&#39;t nurtured and protected it can die.  Worse, if it is destroyed carelessly, it can go past a quiet neutral death to an antagonism and negativity that could, frankly, be dangerous to the freedoms of an unschooling family.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThough some people hop and hoot about freedom when they&#39;re telling others how easy it is to be unschoolers (then they forget, it seems, to talk about learning at all, or about how to unschool... just &quot;how to be unschoolers,&quot; how to join their happy hoppin&#39; hootin&#39; club and Be FREE!), here&#39;s something real that they&#39;re pretending doesn&#39;t exist:<br/>\n<br/>\nNobody has the right to disturb other people&#39;s sleep.   Not adults, not kids.  Since telephones have been invented, the etiquette that goes with them is not to call when others might be sleeping.  An unexpected late-night telephone call now, like a telegram 100 years ago, is likely to mean there&#39;s an emergency�death, jail, car accident.   And a housephone is likely to wake up everyone in the house, which is triply or quadruply (I don&#39;t know adjectives for more than four rudenesses at once) rude.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPLEASE don&#39;t say or do things that cause your children to think they are exempt from societal expectations outside of going to school.  Not going to school is a big one, of course, and if a family opts out, they should replace that with something way better than school.   And if a family goes further, to radical unschooling, it shouldn&#39;t show outside the house.  It shouldn&#39;t involve illegalities or disturb the peace.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t assume that your children will grow up and live in unschooling world.  They are now, and will be, living in the real world.  There isn&#39;t a fantasy world to go to, even though a small subset of unschoolers are trying to magically attract one.  What they&#39;re attracting is more people with a wimpy grasp on reality.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelp your children be whole, thoughtful, impressive people, not wild children who irritate others.<br/>\n<br/>\nEncouraging anything other than a whole, thoughtful, impressive presence isn&#39;t going to impress any neighbors or inlaws. Sometimes neighbors and inlaws who are unimpressed call social workers.<br/>\n<br/>\nEncouraging anything other than a whole, thoughtful, impressive presence isn&#39;t going to impress any social workers or judges.  Sometimes social workers and juges who are unimpressed tell a family to put their kids in school.  In especially unattractive situations, they might just put the children with another family.<br/>\n<br/>\nVery rarely do I go down the negative trails this way, but there ARE such trails.  <br/>\nI like to hope that discussions and links to information about being positive, helpful, useful, happy and considerate can get a family to the point that they&#39;re nowhere near the dangerous cliffs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople with enough money to put kids in expensive alternative schools or move to other countries might find it easier than a family whose only option is that public school down the road.   <br/>\n<br/>\nLive responsibly.  Be a good partner to your child.  Do things as a team (you&#39;ll do most of the thinking and doing, when they&#39;re young) that will cause the neighbors to like you, not to complain and avoid you, if you can.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: a new &#39;democratic&#39; school, & influences & fears","postDate":"1363447512","msgId":70938,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtpMjJzbytsN2NqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDljYWYuNzNlNDhiNy4zZTc0ZmMwN0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":70937,"nextInTopic":70941,"prevInTime":70937,"nextInTime":70939,"topicId":70933,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Be positive about your life with your daughter, positive about what she&#39;s doing. Project a sense of assurance that what you&#39;re doing is what&#39;s right for you and your family - in fact, you might want to join some kind of homeschooling support group (online maybe) where other moms will tell you a bazillion times &quot;you&#39;re doing what&#39;s right for your family&quot; and &quot;you&#39;re a great mom&quot; if you feel like you&#39;re lacking in the confidence department. There is a value to that kind of support sometimes! Learn all those stock phrases homeschoolers and others with alternative lifestyles use and bolster yourself with them. If it helps, get mad at the way schools limit kids&#39; worlds so you can look at your child and confidently say &quot;yes, this is Better than school&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis really isn&#39;t a problem of unschooling or even homeschooling, it&#39;s about being visible as a minority. You need to learn some minority survival/pride skills - it&#39;s not your job to educate the masses about homeschooling, it&#39;s not your job to defend homeschooling, it&#39;s not your job to be a poster mom for the home-ed movement.

It sounds like you&#39;re out and about a lot - way too much for my daughter, but Mo&#39;s a pretty solid introvert. If your kid is happy being out and about that much, then it&#39;s important that you find a way to shut down those sorts of comments so your aquaintances don&#39;t feel like they have a right to say them. If you want, you could offer a reading list with titles like &quot;Unschooling: how to use the whole world as your child&#39;s classroom&quot; - not with the expectation that they&#39;ll actually read anything, but with titles which will make a point (and later you can ask &quot;did you read any of those books?&quot; and shut down the conversation that way). Or you could say something like &quot;she&#39;s too inquisitive for dull old bookwork - she learns much better this way&quot; (with Ray I used to say &quot;he&#39;s such an Active Boy, being in a desk was torture - he&#39;s doing So Much Better since we pulled him out&quot; and with Mo: &quot;Oh, she&#39;s Such an Independent learner it&#39;s all I can do to keep up with her&quot;). Or if you want to be a bad-ass you could rant about how incarcerating children who should be actively exploring the world in concrete boxes all day is tantamount to child abuse and you won&#39;t subject your kid to that kind of treatment (or something similar, look around on facebook and you&#39;ll find something). That won&#39;t win you any friends, but it might stop the conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&quot;...but it&#39;s a rite of passage to get bullied at school, or not  <br/>\n&gt; invited to the popular girl&#39;s birthday party. she NEEDS to learn these things  <br/>\n&gt; and you are babying her by not letting her go through them. she&#39;s going to be <br/>\n&gt;  stunted as an adult and not know how to cope with things.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My dad has come up with stuff like that periodically. One way to respond is to ask something like &quot;do you think we spend all day at the kitchen table doing workbooks?

She has a huge backpack that she carries to school, and one of her before-bed requirements is that she always have it packed and ready to go for the next day - he asks her how long that takes and what she puts in it and why.

Like the <br/>\nposts I&#39;ve  read, yes this one also is &quot;free from bells, free from grades, <br/>\nfree from tests,  free to learn how they want&quot; program&quot;, but at the cost of <br/>\n10k per year. I  wondered as much as we were highly received there, while my <br/>\ndaughter played  with the other children, how on earth I would pay <br/>\nsomething that I could take  her to Seaworld with twice over or another goal, even <br/>\nif we were  granted financial assistance! <br/>\n <br/>\nMy point for writing is this though-, the area we live in, while urban,  <br/>\ndoes not have any large number of unschoolers in it at all, and no matter how  <br/>\nmany activities we do together and my daughter says loves our life, i still <br/>\n get a weekly comment from a neighbor, sometimes an elderly adult, <br/>\nsometimes a  mother of a child on the block she is playing with, and the worst was <br/>\nfrom a  college student who was a guest at a friend&#39;s house we were at, that <br/>\ngets under  my skin. <br/>\nThey all seem so concerned for my daughter...&quot;Is your Mother teaching you  <br/>\nanything at home that you are going out all the time?&quot; or &quot;You are ruining <br/>\nher  life by running her around the city every day and not giving her any  <br/>\nstructure!&quot;, and a classic was about me- &quot;Her daughter called my daughter  at <br/>\n10:30 on a school night! I&#39;m not allowing them to speak anymore!&quot;. The  <br/>\ncollege student&#39;s attempt to have a full on discussion with me, as she  was <br/>\nfascinated about my choice and that my child was probably unhappy. She  went on <br/>\nto say &quot;...but it&#39;s a rite of passage to get bullied at school, or not  <br/>\ninvited to the popular girl&#39;s birthday party. she NEEDS to learn these things  <br/>\nand you are babying her by not letting her go through them. she&#39;s going to be <br/>\n stunted as an adult and not know how to cope with things.&quot; <br/>\n <br/>\nDo I want my daughter to go through any of those things again and much  <br/>\nmore? NO. But I did get scared by these people&#39;s comments. But not know how to  <br/>\ncope-, I found that funny since she has no idea what we&#39;ve been through in <br/>\nour  own life. Why am I so fearful after 2 years of unschooling to the point <br/>\nof  checking out this new democratic school just so I can say, &quot;why yes, <br/>\nshe has  structure and socialization.&quot; That&#39;s about the only reason I would <br/>\neven consider  it. <br/>\n <br/>\nAre these fears still normal to feel, does any one else have them and if so <br/>\n how do you deal with them?<br/>\n <br/>\nI have been keeping up with posts and know there were some topics on  <br/>\nunsupportive families and more so i&#39;ll reread some of those, but I just wanted  <br/>\nto add that. I dont know how if people see my daughter and i in and out of <br/>\nthe  house attending the Phila. Flower Show, or the local Horror Convention <br/>\nfor the  weekend, instead of wanting to &quot;hang&quot; out on the block with the <br/>\nneighborhood  kids, is damaging to her. Or if we sat in on &quot;school nights&quot; and <br/>\nshe would  talk to other unschooling friends online or we would blast though <br/>\nseasons of  Walking Dead all week to discuss her new actress friend from the <br/>\nshow she  met at the Horror Con, plus the plenty of other things we do or <br/>\nsit in together  and enjoy, ...I&#39;m sure i dont have to ask, but am I stunting <br/>\nher growth??? Wow,  it just is sad to me that i let this fear even seep in <br/>\nfrom these people&#39;s  influences on me. <br/>\n <br/>\n-Lynne, Mom to Faith, (9)<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70998,"nextTopicId":71023}}
