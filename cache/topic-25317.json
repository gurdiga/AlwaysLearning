I have 3 children.  <br/>\nMy oldest is almost 14 and attends public school and my two <br/>\nhomeschooled children are 8 and 9 years old.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen &quot;strangers&quot; ask me about school, I just mention we homeschool.  <br/>\nThe usual questions are about socialization, free time for me, and <br/>\nhow much patience I must have.  I don&#39;t go into details about <br/>\nhomeschool methodology with these types of people.  They&#39;re usually <br/>\njust curious that we are doing something different than regular <br/>\nschool and that&#39;s all they need to know.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I encounter other homeschoolers, they always want to know what <br/>\ncurriculum I&#39;m using.  Up until this point, I always had names to <br/>\nspout off of various things we use, explaining we pull a little of <br/>\nthis and a little of that.  Now, I just plan to say we don&#39;t use any <br/>\nformal curriculum but use things around us, i.e. lots of books, <br/>\ncomputer, etc.  If they specifically ask me about methodology, I&#39;ll <br/>\nsay we are life learners, picking up things we need as we go.  I <br/>\nthink the word &#39;unschool&#39; often brings up negative thoughts because <br/>\nit&#39;s so misunderstood.  If anyone persists, maybe even using that <br/>\nterm, I&#39;ll acknowledge we are unschoolers and that we&#39;re learning <br/>\nmore now than we ever did with formal curriculum.  I never get into <br/>\narguments about homeschool methodology.  I believe that everyone has <br/>\ntheir idea of homeschooling and it&#39;s not my place to have to <br/>\nconvince anyone of anything.  If they disapprove of our choices, <br/>\nthen so be it.  I have a couple of friends and they know I&#39;m <br/>\nunschooling now and while they think I&#39;m a little nuts, they are <br/>\nsupportive just as I&#39;m supportive of their choices.

I also have a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-906143938\">Hello,My name is Bridget,I am new to this group.I decided to unschool <br/>\nmy two youngest,Moe who is almost three,and Mimi who will be two this <br/>\nfall. I also have a grown son Nick who will be 22yrs old soon,(wow how <br/>\ntime flies).The decision to unschool was an easy one and I certainly <br/>\nhave the support of my friends and family.I have gone to the  many <br/>\nlinks suggested,I have read many articles and am in the process of <br/>\nreading through a mountain of books.I realise though it is the process <br/>\nitself that will teach me the most.I am astounded by how much sage <br/>\nadvice you can gleen from this site. I have two questions.My son often <br/>\npulls his sister&#39;s hair.I do not condone spanking.I have tried time-<br/>\nouts(one minute for each year),and my sons cries and cries so much <br/>\nthat I feel they are perhaps  not the ideal method either,any <br/>\nsuggestions?Second question,how do you respond to people who question <br/>\nyour decision to unschool.I can recite stats,I can choose to ignore <br/>\nthe question, I suggests sites they can visit,books they can read but <br/>\nI sometimes feel ambushed by others who feel their need to tell me <br/>\nwhat I am doing is wrong.I do not want come off flip either since <br/>\nthese are my fellow collegues and I do not want to risk alienating <br/>\nthem needlessly,I am a nurse and team work is essential.Thank-you</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25564,"nextTopicId":25334}}
