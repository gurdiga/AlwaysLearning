(whose son. .  .is four and is more interested in learning about <br/>\npresidents than his colors in  school), and she&#39;s been talking it up to a friend <br/>\nof hers.  They&#39;ve checked  out your website, and it apparently was <br/>\nmind-altering!  [She] says her  friend is probably going to take her youngest out of <br/>\nschool.  <br/>\n <br/>\nOne of them is  probably going to write to you and ask about resources.  I <br/>\ntold [her]  that you&#39;d most likely send them a list of websites and a link to <br/>\nsome chat list  or something.  <br/>\n <br/>\nOH!   And [the co-worker&#39;s friend] teaches autistic kids parttime, and  wants <br/>\nto incorporate some of the stuff she read off your website.  <br/>\n <br/>\nCool,  eh?<br/>\n <br/>\nWendy<br/>\n <br/>\np.s.  I haven&#39;t  heard the radio interview you sent me yet.  This week has <br/>\nbeen crazy and I  haven&#39;t been on email much.  I wanted to wait until I had time <br/>\nto properly  enjoy it. :-)<br/>\n <br/>\n-------------------<br/>\n <br/>\nYeah, that IS cool,and I thought I&#39;d share  it with this group, and also the <br/>\nlink to the radio interview, which is edited so  tightly that not only does it <br/>\nseem I never have to breathe, but sometimes I  start talking before I&#39;m <br/>\nthrough talking.  I interrupt myself!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI was afraid it would be some difficult  download, but it turned out to be <br/>\nvery quick and easy.<br/>\nHere&#39;s the link, and a note I sent to the  webpage announcement list:<br/>\n============================<br/>\n   <br/>\n_http://www.radio4all.net/proginfo.php?id=11724_ <br/>\n(http://www.radio4all.net/proginfo.php?id=11724) <br/>\n <br/>\nI was interviewed for a radio show by unschoolers in Hamilton, in Ontario,  <br/>\n&quot;Radio Free School.&quot;  I was asked to discuss strewing and spirituality, so  <br/>\nthose are the themes.  I used a couple of examples I&#39;ve used in other  talks, but <br/>\nalso said some things I&#39;d never said before, so I&#39;m happy with  it.  It&#39;s <br/>\nedited down pretty tightly (half an hour from a 90 minute  interview), so it <br/>\nsounds like I talk even faster than I really DO talk.   (Also I said &quot;civil war&quot; <br/>\nwhen I had intended to say something else, but so it  goes... overall I think <br/>\nit&#39;s good.)  There are musical interludes.  &lt;g&gt;  Either I forgot to say or it <br/>\nwas cut that the kids were offered  their jobs, and didn&#39;t apply for them.  (So <br/>\nit&#39;s partly that they were  noticeably cool kids that got them the offer, I <br/>\nsuppose, and I wish I&#39;d said  that.)<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s what I received from the interviewer/editor just today:<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n------------------------------<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nDear Sandra,<br/>\nthe show has been uploaded so that you can listen to it when you get a  <br/>\nchance.  It was very inspiring- I must say, quiet a few people have told me  they <br/>\nwere inspired too. I wonder if we could get in in the Life Learning  Magazine?  <br/>\nWould you be interested?  I know you were open to me  including excerpts for <br/>\nmy book so.??<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\nWarmly<br/>\nBeatrice Ekoko<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nrfs<br/>\nradio free school<br/>\nradio by, for and about un-schoolers<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nrfs wed. march 16, 2005 <br/>\n Improving  Unschooling<br/>\nInterview;  Sandra Dodd<br/>\nmusic; Pete  Seeger; Bronwyn Kay-original composition<br/>\nedit;  Beatrice Ekwa Ekoko<br/>\n <br/>\nWhy do people take or keep their children  out of school? Mostly for three <br/>\nreasons; they think that raising their children  is their business, not the <br/>\ngovernment’s; they enjoy being with their children  and watching them and helping <br/>\nthem learn, and don’t want to give that up to  others; they want to keep them <br/>\nfrom being hurt mentally, physically and  spiritually.
