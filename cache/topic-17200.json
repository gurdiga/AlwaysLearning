I am a <br/>\nhomeopath and my daughter is a 16-year-old competitive figure <br/>\nskater.  She falls dozens of times every day, at high speed, and <br/>\nhard.  A month or so ago she dislocated her shoulder.  Last week she <br/>\nhad a huge swollen bruise on her thigh.  It is always something in <br/>\nhigh level figure skating.<br/>\n<br/>\nI always carry homeopathic Arnica Montana 30C with me to the ice <br/>\narena, and a bottle of Arnica spray, as well as Arnica gel for <br/>\ntopical application.  We apply the spray if the injury is too sore to <br/>\ntouch, and the gel if we can touch it, and she takes the Arnica 30C <br/>\ninternally, as often as one pellet every 15 minutes when the pain is <br/>\nsevere.  And we ice the injury with a bag of crushed ice.  As the <br/>\npain lessens we take the Arnica 30C pellets less and less frequently <br/>\nuntil she doesn&#39;t need them, or needs them only a couple of times a <br/>\nday as the healing progresses.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor sprains and strains we additionally use Ruta Graveolens 30C.  And <br/>\nfor injuries to areas rich in nerves, like finger, toes, elbows or <br/>\ntailbones, we use Hypericum 30C and Hypericum spray. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is swelling or bad pain that continues despite the remedies <br/>\nand the icing then I might get an appointment with an orthopedics <br/>\nspecialist to have someone look at an x-ray and see what she has <br/>\ndone.  When she had the mild shoulder dislocation I figured that was <br/>\nwhat it was and that there really is nothing that we can do about <br/>\nthat.  So the Arnica is the best treatment anyway.  We did get the x-<br/>\nray to be sure she hadn&#39;t done more than that, though.  Same for the <br/>\nbruise on her thigh.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she has sprained her ankle, or her wrist, or injured her coccyx, <br/>\nor broken bones (usually hairline or stress fractures are most <br/>\ncommon), we do Arnica first and continue it, usually taking care of <br/>\nthe pain and healing the injury quickly and completely.  We go to the <br/>\northopedics doc if it doesn&#39;t seem to be healing quickly, mostly just <br/>\nto verify what has been injured and how bad it is.  So far she has <br/>\nnever needed a cast, only an &quot;immobilizer&quot; wrap for a broken humerus <br/>\nonce, and a soft ankle cast for a bad sprain.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor head injuries, however, we do not hesitate to go to the doctor.  <br/>\nI still administer the homeopathic remedies, but we do not want to <br/>\ntake any chances with brain injury.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also broke my ankle stepping in a pothole and twisting it.  It hurt <br/>\nbadly, but I had my Arnica 30C with me, took some, and was able to <br/>\ndrive home.  I kept up the Arnica both internally and topically, iced <br/>\nthe ankle when it hurt, wrapped it with an Ace bandage, and was doing <br/>\nwell.  But after about ten days I noticed that it had suddenly <br/>\nballooned up, which hadn&#39;t happened until then.  That was when I went <br/>\nto an orthopedics person for an x-ray and he said that it was indeed <br/>\nbroken.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe, of course, wanted to put me in a cast.  I said, gee, I have been <br/>\nwalking around on this for ten days now.  Seems to me I could just go <br/>\nwith one of those walking casts during the day, and wrap it at night, <br/>\nso that I can get some sleep.  He agreed, grudgingly, and when I went <br/>\nback for my check-up a month later he was very surprised.  He <br/>\nsaid, &quot;I don&#39;t know what you did, but it sure worked.  You do not <br/>\nneed a cast, which I had expected I would be giving you today, and <br/>\nyou no longer need the walking cast, either.&quot;  He showed me the x-<br/>\nrays and the break had healed very nicely.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo get some Arnica 30C from your local health food store.  Get some <br/>\nArnica spray and/or Arnica gel, too.  The Ruta and Hypericum, <br/>\nincluding the Hypericum spray, are also excellent to have on hand.  <br/>\nThese are your best first line of defense in these types of injuries <br/>\nand cheap, too!  Ice and immobolize as much as possible.  If pain <br/>\ncontinues or swelling occurs then get to the orthopedics doc to see <br/>\nwhat has happened.  Usually this is just reassuring, but helps to <br/>\nknow exactly what you are dealing with.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNorma  <br/>\nThe Infinitessimal Dose<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Infinitessimal\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Infinitessimal</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":118406848,"authorName":"joylyn","from":"joylyn &lt;joylyn@...&gt;","profile":"joylynrsf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Off Topic: sprains/breaks/ankles","postDate":"1067845495","msgId":17201,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNGQTYwNzc3LjcwNjA4MDVAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDMxMTAzMDY0MC5oQTM2ZUhsdzAwMzIwOUBtdGF3Ni5wcm9kaWd5Lm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDMxMTAzMDY0MC5oQTM2ZUhsdzAwMzIwOUBtdGF3Ni5wcm9kaWd5Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":17200,"nextInTopic":17207,"prevInTime":17200,"nextInTime":17202,"topicId":17200,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I usually wait 24 hours, over night.

After a while (usually overnight) the body <br/>\nforgets that pain.  If the child is still not weight bearing the next <br/>\nmorning, regardless of swelling or not, I would take them in.  If Mikey <br/>\nis putting some weight on the foot, I might wait for another 24 hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I went for two weeks iwth a broken arm becuase it wasn&#39;t <br/>\nswollen and the pain was only sometimes.  After a few weeks, I put my <br/>\nhand into a pair of tight jeans and pulled it out and broke it more.  It <br/>\nwas still a minor break but it probably didn&#39;t do my arm a whole lot of <br/>\ngood to go for two weeks with the bone not set correctly. I was also in <br/>\nsome pain those weeks, not all the time but there were bad moments, I <br/>\nremember.  I was just told I bruised my arm and that it would get <br/>\nbetter.  It did, after the break was set and the doc said I was in <br/>\nenough pain to be offered some pain killers for a few days. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I try to find the middle ground between &quot;wait and see&quot; and go to the <br/>\ndoctor immediately.   Non-weight bearing (or non using) means to me a <br/>\ntrip to the doctor pretty quickly, depending upon the kid.  My nephew <br/>\nwas hit with a baseball pretty seriously last week, and if he had been <br/>\nmy kid I would have taken him right away, just based on the way he <br/>\nwasn&#39;t using the arm and wasn&#39;t moving it, etc. after the injury.  They <br/>\ntook him late that night and while it wasn&#39;t broken, it was bruised <br/>\nseverely.  One of the girls on my soccer team had her finger jammed when <br/>\nshe blocked a ball.  It swelled up pretty quickly, and we put it on <br/>\nice.  I suggested strongly that they wrap the finger to the other two <br/>\nfingers right away and if the swelling didn&#39;t go down within 24 hours, <br/>\nto take her to the doc.  They didn&#39;t. Two days later the finger was <br/>\nstill very swollen, and I was much stronger in my words.  They took her <br/>\nto the doctor and the finger was splinted for two weeks, no goalieing. I <br/>\nwanted to say &quot;I told you so&quot; and I wonder what would have happened if <br/>\nthey would have splinted immediately...<br/>\n<br/>\n I&#39;m rambling now, need to go off to bed.  I think wait and see is ok <br/>\nfor a short time period (about 24 hours) but if he can&#39;t put weight on <br/>\nit in the am, I&#39;d take him to the doc.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\nPam Hartley wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My stoic child, Mikey, took a tumble off her scooter this evening and<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t/won&#39;t put weight on her right foot.
