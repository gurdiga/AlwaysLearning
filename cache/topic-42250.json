In my case I have a child <br/>\n&gt; who <br/>\n&gt; wants to have all controls/responsibility removed.  I don&#39;t see this <br/>\n&gt; as odd, but quite appropriate for a teenager...  The school he <br/>\n&gt; attends though has disregarded this desire in him altogether, and now <br/>\n&gt; we are at an imbalance.

His behavior <br/>\nis primarily a reaction--which is why it looks normal for a 13 year old to be starting a <br/>\n&quot;rebellious&quot; phase.  What if there were nothing to rebel against?  What if there hadn&#39;t been <br/>\ninfluences pushing and shaping him for the past 9 or so years--would he have to push <br/>\nback?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do agree with you that schooled children are looking to be more grown up than they are <br/>\nreally ready for, but unschooled teens usually looks so very different.  If you follow this <br/>\npath, you don&#39;t really know what you&#39;ll find in six months as you and your son connect <br/>\nmore deeply--you can only extrapolate from the experiences of those on this list and <br/>\nother unschoolers, but since your son and your family will have your own unique <br/>\nexperience you won&#39;t really know.  This is one of the vast differences between this <br/>\napproach and school.  School pushes toward conformity and unschooling is pretty much <br/>\nthe opposite.  Each child is valued for who they are, in the positive, and people thrive by <br/>\nhaving the positives recognized.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I see in my 13 year old son is a boy who is very relaxed to be at the age he&#39;s at.  He&#39;s <br/>\nhappily exploring life with me, and he shares everything with me.  I consciously made <br/>\nchoices when he was much younger with the teen years in mind, and they are paying off <br/>\nwith a kid who is perfectly comfortable with adults and tells me he feels sad when his <br/>\nfriends don&#39;t have good relationships with their parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know things can turn around positively for your son.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny C","from":"&quot;Jenny C&quot; &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: What do unschoolers DO?","postDate":"1235281779","msgId":42327,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGducXAxaitkZzRmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFFQzdCODAwLTBDOTctNDlBOS1BNTlFLTE2MzQ0RkU1OTBGOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":42326,"nextInTopic":42328,"prevInTime":42326,"nextInTime":42328,"topicId":42250,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Humans are incredibly social animals. We seek out other people and make choices based on things that will help us to get along with them, to fit in a group. David did an interesting study with pictures of people. He digitally manipulated pictures of men who had been rated as less attractive so that they were partnered with pictures of women who were rated as attractive or more attractive than the man. Anyhow female raters would rate men with more attractive women as more attractive then when they were alone or with less attractive women. It&#39;s called mate choice copying. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am not autonomous in my life. At some level I choose that, but there is a lot that is outside of much of my conscious decision making. I make choices based not only on my immediate biological environment (hormones, bio-rhythm, stress, genetics, etc...) but also based on thing in my physical environment. I also make a lot of choices based on the care I want to give to my family. A family who I completely do not want to be autonomous from. <br/>\n<br/>\nOver at Run.ning Meredith posted links to a couple of pieces on autonomy (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://familyrun.ning.com/forum/topics/nature-of-autonomy?id=2184370%3ATopic%3A52415&page=2#comments)\">http://familyrun.ning.com/forum/topics/nature-of-autonomy?id=2184370%3ATopic%3A52415&page=2#comments)</a>. I couldn&#39;t read them. I tried and it was beyond me. But in my skimming through one of the papers I read that some researcher said that they didn&#39;t believe in that anyone could truly be autonomous because they can never be outside of their environment. I think that&#39;s where I go whenever I think about autonomy.  I went and found it: Bandura (1989), for example,<br/>\ndefined autonomy as action that is ‘‘entirely independent’’ of the<br/>\nenvironment (p. 1175). He then argued that because virtually all actions<br/>\nare affected by one’s environment, there can be no meaningful<br/>\nconcept of autonomy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe authors of the paper dismiss his argument by saying that this idea is covered within their paradigm of Self Determination Theory and as such is not distinct from an autonomous action. I must admit I get bogged down with the number of things that weigh in on any decision I make, no matter how quickly I make it. And I think I fall in Bandura&#39;s camp. I think that I don&#39;t believe there is a meaningful concept of autonomy. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Saturday, 21 February, 2009 8:17:30 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: What do unschoolers DO?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are my shorter, more important answers, for those who don&#39;t like  <br/>\nto read much:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Isn&#39;t seeking Autonomy part of human nature?  -=-<br/>\nYes.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Isn&#39;t seeking a level of autonomy healthy?-=-<br/>\nYes, increasingly as children are older and fully as adults.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

Look deeply past difficult behaviors to discover the underlying needs of our children (and ourselves), and begin to use concrete tools to respond effectively to parenting challenges.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur interactive class covers respectful limit setting, developmental norms, listening to feelings and many practical ideas about what to do instead of being either an authoritarian or a permissive parent.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIncorporates concepts from the work of Alfie Kohn (Unconditional Parenting), Dr. Gordon Neufeld (Hold on to Your Kids), Lawrence J. Cohen (Playful Parenting) and Marshall Rosenburg (NVC), as well as the professional and personal experience of Lyla and Emily. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246499406,"authorName":"Lauren","from":"&quot;Lauren&quot; &lt;yis4yoga@...&gt;","profile":"yis4yoga","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: What do unschoolers DO?","postDate":"1235245412","msgId":42271,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGducGxoNCtsZDBzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDBBOEUzMjBGLUIwRDItNEVGNy04NTMwLTRCNkIyOEJCNDdCN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":42269,"nextInTopic":42273,"prevInTime":42270,"nextInTime":42272,"topicId":42250,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I am searching for a way to bring this <br/>\nexperience back into balance.<br/>\n<br/>\n Are my beliefs justifiable  (him not being <br/>\nready/mature/knowledgeable) is that not the right/best/appropriate <br/>\nway to look at it?      Are there other ways to &quot;see&quot; my son?<br/>\n<br/>\nby justifiable I mean, that in the greater society we tend to think <br/>\nthat children need guidance and structure, protection, limits, <br/>\nsheilded from certain language and activities that adults engage in, <br/>\nthat many things should be decided for them until certain ages...<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see here that some are going to question whether or not I <br/>\nreally Know my son that I am asking our my beliefs justifiable... I <br/>\ndo know my son, on an intuitive level I do not think he is mature <br/>\nenough, but then I have to wonder do I need to look at a bias in my <br/>\nbelief?  What is it about the larger society that has influenced me <br/>\nto believe the things I believe.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here is where Unschooling is confusing to me.... because at one <br/>\nlevel I am understanding or misunderstanding the ideas about limits, <br/>\nI am understanding that lightening up on limits is a way to allow for <br/>\nautonomy, is a way to allow for the child to understand himself, to <br/>\nlearn by the experiences he chooses (remember also I am dealing with <br/>\na teen not a 2 year old.)....not by the experiences he is forced into <br/>\nhaving.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is very hard to articulate and I do fear being misunderstood <br/>\nhere... just keep in mind, I&#39;m looking for clarification on <br/>\nphilosophy of Unschooling,... so I can take it and apply it (or not) <br/>\nto my situation... <br/>\n<br/>\n I&#39;m just putting out there thoughts, not necessarily personal <br/>\nfeelings, ideas, beliefs.....I&quot;m trying to understand  a deeper <br/>\nunderstanding of unschooling.  of the philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\n If anyone wants to write personal realizations, stories, experiences <br/>\nwithout taking up the time and space in the forum I would love to <br/>\nreceive personal emails.   I know it&#39;s easy to send me a link to <br/>\nanother site, but more I&#39;m looking for communion, personal <br/>\ninteraction, feelings,<br/>\n<br/>\n Would you say that those that choose unschooling have certain <br/>\npersonality types?  <br/>\n<br/>\n Do unschoolers have fears of how they are judged perceived by <br/>\ngreater society?  If so what are the fears?  How have any of them <br/>\nbeen dealt with or overcome?<br/>\n<br/>\n In asking these questions I do not mean to be coming from any place <br/>\nof judgment, preconceived notions, only looking for understanding,  <br/>\nonly looking to have a clearer perception.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKara<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Lauren&quot; &lt;yis4yoga@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; There must be many more, but how many things can a new <br/>\n </span></blockquote>unschooler incorporate <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; at once?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Unschoolers support and encourage their children&#39;s innate self-<br/>\n </span></blockquote>awareness.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; (I&#39;m thinking of self-awareness in regards to their self-knowledge <br/>\n </span></blockquote>of their own physical <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and emotional needs, etc.--having trouble stating this in a simple, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>concise manner!)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lauren :)<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: What do unschoolers DO?","postDate":"1235242475","msgId":42257,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI1MTczMjdCLTZCRTktNDBGMi1CMjQ0LTM0RUZGNjY0MDYzQkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGducGY4YStjcGVhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGducGY4YStjcGVhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":42252,"nextInTopic":42259,"prevInTime":42256,"nextInTime":42258,"topicId":42250,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Unschoolers support and encourage their children s innate self- awareness.
