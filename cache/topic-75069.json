gentleman who is currently working in computer vision. &nbsp;He is such a sweet man, and brilliant. &nbsp;He has changed the way we search and categorize photos online. &nbsp;We were talking about how much Ethan enjoys video games. &nbsp;I have historically assumed that people in the computer science field would embrace game play, but that is most often not the case, and this was one of those times. &nbsp;After sharing a bit of my son&#39;s enthusiasm, this man looked down at the ground and told us that he was ashamed because he used to play video games too much. &nbsp;He said he wasted a lot of time. &nbsp;I was gobsmacked. &nbsp;I looked under at him to make eye contact again and I asked him if he really thought it was time wasted, or if he had ever considered it was time invested, contributing in a real and meaningful way to who he is today. &nbsp;He literally was tongue-tied, seemingly never having thought this before, and quietly asked himself aloud could it be possible that playing all those games had contributed to his current success. &nbsp;He answered his own question in the negative, but I could see the wheels working for some time after that. &nbsp;</div><div

Atari game ever made, then followed by a series of PC first player shooter games. &nbsp;Currently, he plays Starcraft 2. &nbsp;He will still play for hours when he can. &nbsp;He loves playing. &nbsp;It helps him unwind as well as keeps his mind sharp. &nbsp;Recently Doug taught a lecture in his introduction to computer science class, where he used Starcraft 2 as an example he was hoping the students could relate too. &nbsp;He said it was humourous to see the faces of the students before him -- a room of 400 bodies. &nbsp;A few even took pictures of him talking in front of his slides because (I assume) they were so surprised a professor was using a video game to illustrate the material they were learning. &nbsp;And, he knew his game, so that was even more impressive!

Is an action hurting someone? Is it causing destruction? Is it disrespectful of others?<br/>\n<br/>\nSocial skills are probably the most difficult skills to learn. That&#39;s because the child needs an awareness not just of how well it&#39;s working for him but how well it&#39;s working for the other person. That awareness comes with ages. Kids can end up hurting others and nuking friendships if they&#39;re left to figure it out themselves before they can understand what they&#39;re doing wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it&#39;s helpful both to the child and others to step in when the child is hurting someone. It&#39;s helpful to assume they don&#39;t want to hurt others. Kids just haven&#39;t mastered the skills to meet a need AND not hurt others.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for that situation, it sounds like it wasn&#39;t a matter of being deliberately insensitive. It&#39;s that he didn&#39;t realize he was insensitive. You could have then pointed out that how he reacted may have hurt his friend&#39;s feelings. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s usually helpful with kids to begin with the assumption that they don&#39;t know how rather than assume they do know how and have deliberately chosen to be mean or hurtful or selfish.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":481701206,"authorName":"","from":"hcdearmore@...","profile":"iamhelenthemom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Question about addressing behavior","postDate":"1415462330","msgId":75069,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG0zbGVqbysxNnBhcTNkQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":75070,"prevInTime":75068,"nextInTime":75070,"topicId":75069,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This may not be the right place to ask this, but unschooling and the whole philosophy behind it is very new and eye-opening to me.
