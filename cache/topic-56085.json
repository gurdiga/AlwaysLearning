It really sounds like you&#39;re doing the best you can with your <br/>\ndaughter - the reality is it does suck, I don&#39;t think you can change <br/>\nthat for her. You probably are already being very reassuring that she is <br/>\ngoing to be fine - that&#39;s important because at 8 she&#39;s still pretty <br/>\nself-focused and worried about what&#39;s going to happen to her. Can her <br/>\ndad and her brother spend just a bit more time with her? Even if it was <br/>\njust a few minutes at a time, their focused attention would probably <br/>\ncalm her a bit - make her not feel alone. I know that&#39;s a lot to ask of <br/>\nthem, they&#39;re trying to cope themselves and take care of businesses, <br/>\netc., but if they can take even just a minute to cuddle with her, pat <br/>\nher as they walk past, maybe sit beside her for a minute while she&#39;s <br/>\nwatching tv or something. Is it too difficult to have another child over <br/>\nto play with her? Maybe there is a quiet and easy kid who could play <br/>\nwith her but she&#39;d still be at home with you.

My left eye and eye-nerve is so infected that I <br/>\ncan&#39;t see with this eye, and the brain is infected again. I&#39;m in and out of the <br/>\nhospital every day, undergoing severe treatment to for now get rid of the <br/>\nsymptoms and hopefully eventually recover.<br/>\nMy husband and son (18) have taken over the household chores and my husband is <br/>\ntaking me back and forth to the hospital, and are coping well with this sudden <br/>\nchange and fear, but my daughter (8) is shattered. She could stay for four days <br/>\nwith good friends, which was good for all of us, but since she is home she is <br/>\nafraid to go from my side. I try to arrange a couple of hours a day with friends <br/>\nand playgroups, especially when I&#39;m in the hospital, but she has mixed feelings <br/>\nabout it. She wants to go and enjoys herself when she is there but wants to be <br/>\nwith me too. She is very angry that I am ill again and I acknowledge her in this <br/>\nfeeling. She had to deal with my illness, recovery and again illness since <br/>\nDecember last year and she want the mother she had back. It is painful for me to <br/>\nsee her missing a lot of fun things we used to do, she misses my energy, and she <br/>\nis, as we are afraid for the future. I try to do things together we both like to <br/>\ndo, like watch nature movies together, and play games in bed, and cuddle and <br/>\ntalk, and watch her play computer games, but it&#39;s not really fulfilling her <br/>\nneeds. She suddenly wants to soothe herself with a lot of sweets, which i don&#39;t <br/>\nmind so much but it is not filling her need as well. It helps a little to eat <br/>\nchocolate and cookies but after eating she is still sad.<br/>\nI don&#39;t have a very supporting family nearby, who will help out.
