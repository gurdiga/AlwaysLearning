This is an annual event... <br/>\nMy kids and I are going this weekend as I am goign to try to write an <br/>\narticle about the camp (both homeschooling and the rainbow camp, and <br/>\nalso this artist they have at the camp...<br/>\n <br/>\nThe camp is by Big Bear in Southern California.  There is a map at the <br/>\nwebsite.  I can&#39;t speak highly enough of this camp, and the people that <br/>\nwork there.
