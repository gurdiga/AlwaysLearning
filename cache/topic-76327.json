I&#39;ve been reading about and trying out unschooling principles since our oldest was about 6 months old.  I have always loved to learn new things and have actively pursued many varied interests so academic unschooling made perfect sense to me from the beginning.  It took quite a bit longer for me to really begin to understand the importance of the relationships along with everything else but it&#39;s coming much easier to view my real children and interact with Them instead of the Imaginary children I might sometimes wish I had.<br clear=\"none\">\n<br clear=\"none\">\nIt&#39;s still really hard for me to look at my husband and see Him and not the Man-I-Wished-I&#39;d-Married (or rather how he falls short of that).  <br clear=\"none\">\n<br clear=\"none\">\nEarlier this year we went through a really rough patch that hit me out of the blue and made me suddenly afraid that our marriage might not only not last forever but not even last the year.  He assures me that he doesn&#39;t want to leave but I&#39;m finding my thoughts full of awful things like I never really loved him and I married him for the wrong reasons and I should have known from the beginning that I shouldn&#39;t have married him, let alone had two children with him.  I have made good enough progress on being kind that I&#39;ve managed to avoid saying any of that out loud and I&#39;ve managed to avoid saying anything even in anger or hurt that I&#39;d wished I could take back.  <br clear=\"none\">\n<br clear=\"none\">\nHere&#39;s the main point of my question: I&#39;m not an explosive person and am far more prone to not saying things that I maybe should rather than hurt someone with my words.  Are there any times that complaining to a spouse about their behavior and how it makes me feel are actually helpful?  Or is that pretty much always putting more distance between us and would be better served to find ways to let go?  More specifically he is very self centered and selfish with his time typically spending less than 5 hours a week playing with his boys and I&#39;m lucky if I get any focused attention at all.<br clear=\"none\">\n<br clear=\"none\">\n_____________<br clear=\"none\">\n<br clear=\"none\">\nEnd of the quote.<br clear=\"none\">\nIf there are new members here who want to jump up and recommend divorce, please don’t.<br clear=\"none\">\n<br clear=\"none\">\nSandra</p>\n\n    </div>\n     \n\n    \n    <div style=\"color:#fff;height:0;\"></div></div>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n            </blockquote></div></blockquote></span></blockquote></div></div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":553037573,"authorName":"tandos mama","from":"tandos mama &lt;tori.arpad.cotta@...&gt;","profile":"tandosmama@bellsouth.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: About marriage, attitude, hope?","postDate":"1448740422","msgId":76355,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBTExDdytQS05nWlM3RDNqS2R4NmMyYU5LaW5jLU93VU5lWVVmZDFuV2JKYU82RmNxd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":76352,"nextInTopic":77003,"prevInTime":76354,"nextInTime":76356,"topicId":76327,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There is such beauty and hope in the stories here--even in the ones that describe current struggle, because the decision to write, to ask for help, suggests a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1677644191\"><div dir=\"ltr\"><div>There is such beauty and hope in the stories here--even in the ones that describe current struggle, because the decision to write, to ask for help, suggests a way forward.

It&#39;s where preparing food is an act of love whether its a homegrown dinner or snacks from the nearest gas station. I keep meaning to photograph the soles of our bare feet--as likely to be covered in glitter as dog hair.

I keep reading these posts, and growing *more* in my own marriage. Tonight, on my birthday, my husband and I were sitting by the woodstove and having a cognac (now he&#39;s off playing Worms Armageddon with the boys), and talking about some of the changes that are coming. I&#39;m in a practitioner program to do work that I am passionate about, and he is in transition from the career that he wanted and worked so hard for, to the next thing now that the last dream is no longer the right dream. I realized that I am SO EXCITED to anticipate generating some income for the family so that he can have more flexibility. I am SO GRATEFUL for the times uncountable that he has gotten up in the dark and scraped the ice off the windshield to work outside even when it wasn&#39;t fun, so that I could be home with our sons. The hours he spent cleaning and organizing the house so that I would be safe when I came home from my transplant. The tears he shed in the dark so that I wouldn&#39;t know how hard, how terrifying, it was to wonder if his wife would ever come home from the hospital. The hours he spent with a baby in a sling under a guitar, juggling a bottle and a four year old who needed a security and a promise he didn&#39;t know he could give them.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So thank you, everyone who has contributed here, for reminding me good it is.

It took a year of weekly visits to an expensive therapist, but it was more than worth it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the years, I have recognized the power I have in relationships. Not a power over anyone or anything, but power to change my perception, which changes my world and affects everyone around me. It wasn&#39;t until our second round in therapy that my husband was able to articulate in a way I understood how much he felt like a failure, and how much I contributed to that feeling. My expectations were impossible for him - or anyone - to live up to, and I made sure he knew all my disappointments. He and I approach and perceive the world in astoundingly different ways. I saw his reticence to share his feelings with me as him being distant, selfish, and uncaring. He saw my insistence that he behave as I did as me being critical, controlling, and inflexible. One of us was right. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve learned that the complaints that start cascading in my mind are a signal for me to look at myself. What have I been doing that is less than loving, less than accepting, less than kind? What can I do for myself in those moments so I can be more generous with those around me? What is my responsibility, and where am I being unnecessarily controlling? My husband has helped me see where I&#39;m painfully critical, hopefully saving our child from those harmful experiences. I&#39;ve helped him see how some of his ways are hurtful to me, even if that wasn&#39;t his intent. We&#39;ve elucidated patterns that we can now point out to each other and say &quot;look, we&#39;re doing it again&quot; and avoid falling in that same hole again, which has been the most helpful thing about therapy. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHow is your attitude toward your husband affecting your children, both now and in the future (thinking that you could potentially treat them similarly)? We recently went through another rough patch. At one point I asked him if he thought we&#39;d be happier apart. He basically told me to stop being dramatic and ridiculous, which just so happened to be the best response in that moment. I&#39;m grateful we both come from intact families and divorce isn&#39;t an option we take seriously, not one that&#39;s on the table (though one I admit to fantasizing about in the worst moments - purely a selfish indulgence on my part - and then I continue my fantasy on to how horrible holidays would be, how sad our daughter would be, and how I&#39;d be stuck with him anyway because we share a child so I might as well shift my thinking and stop being an asshole to him, even if it&#39;s only in my mind). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have one child. Sometimes I feel like I have two. It&#39;s in those moments I stop and think about how much he loves our daughter, how she absolutely adores him, how good he is at playing with her, how much he trusts me to be the one to make major decisions for her regarding diet, healthcare, education, etc. I used to resent that he wouldn&#39;t give his opinions more often on those things until he pointed out I was the one who did all the reading and research (which is my inclination naturally, and not his, which is neither right nor wrong, but one of our many differences) and he felt like a bumbling idiot sometimes, and he deeply respects and trusts me and knows I&#39;m a good mom. So it was a sign of appreciation that I misinterpreted. It took me years of being with him to realize I&#39;m hard to live with too! I&#39;m not perfect. The critical thoughts about him come from the part of me that thinks I&#39;m perfect. I can now recognize her voice, and hush it up faster. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a gift to my husband, my daughter, myself, and every living creature who crosses my path. Imagine all the incredible learning I would have missed had I left him all those years ago, before our first try at therapy? When I get stuck in negative thinking patterns, I like to look around at our family photos and think about how much I enjoy seeing us smiling together. I look at photos of us when we were dating, and remember the things about him that made me fall in love. I think ahead to something fun we have planned. I&#39;ll go to the grocery store and get ingredients to make his favorite food, and allow his happiness to be a buoy for me. I&#39;ll suggest we watch a show we both like and we&#39;ll laugh together. I&#39;ll ask for a hug. I&#39;ll watch our daughter hold his hand or giggle at their play. She loves him so much, I&#39;d never purposely do anything to mess that up. cheri</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: About marriage, attitude, hope?","postDate":"1448653922","msgId":76349,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVCN0I4RkNELTAxOTQtNDhCMi05QzcxLUE0OUM4MDhDQUY5MEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEIxMDM1RjkxLTZERTAtNEM0MC1BNDNGLTRCMjBBQjI3MkM1NUB5YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDkyNTQzNjY0LTc3REItNERGMy1COTQwLUU3MTEwRkI5MTQ4M0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPG4zNmZhait0Z3VqNzZAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPiA8REMyNkVBMjQtQzQwMS00NzQwLUFBQjUtRERFQkQyODk0RjdGQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8bjM3azQ2KzE0aXVrcTZAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NEFDMEI3OEUtMzE0Ni00QjhDLUJCRTMtODc3QzQwMDI0RkRDQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8QjEwMzVGOTEtNkRFMC00QzQwLUE0M0YtNEIyMEFCMjcyQzU1QHlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":76346,"nextInTopic":76350,"prevInTime":76348,"nextInTime":76350,"topicId":76327,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Here is a beautiful response from the anonymous mom with the original question  I think it will help everyone who reads it. ____________________________ My","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1305724596\">Here is a beautiful response from the anonymous mom with the original question  I think it will help everyone who reads it.<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMy only regret in writing is that I didn&#39;t write the group sooner.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt gives me lots of hope that there are other marriages who have been here and moved past it.  I pretty much got the advice I expected and it came with some specifics that will help.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first signed up for Just Add Light and Stir I enjoyed reading and thinking about the messages every morning but I haven&#39;t given them time to sink in lately, I&#39;ll take that time again, it helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never wanted to consider divorce, I was afraid he was going to walk away.  My boys happiness is far more important to me than my own, I can find so much joy in their smiles, unless their safety was at stake (which it isn&#39;t), leaving daddy is not on the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren James&#39; suggestions to soften into the little moments is exactly what I need to do.  There are lots of good moments if I don&#39;t crowd them out by getting prickly about the bad moments.  I will more consciously shift my focus.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have any close friends where we are but I&#39;m very lucky that the group of mommas we spend a lot of time with is a very positive group.  There is never any husband bashing.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Sandra:  -=-The next step is not to think those things, and not to store them up and polish them and wonder when the right time to say them will be. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course.  So simple, not easy, but simple.  I can do that.  I can change my thought patterns and stop thinking those thoughts (I did know there was never a time to say those awful thoughts if I wanted to keep the marriage).  The image of keeping thoughts and polishing them up is a really good description of what I was doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn response to the &quot;who do I think I am?&quot; part, I think I&#39;m going to work on shifting my emphasis away from identifying as an unschooling mom more to being mom and wife.  My husband isn&#39;t very interested in unschooling as he understands it, but after a good conversation we had the other day, I think that&#39;s just cause his understanding is based on my very flawed original understanding from years ago.  The important parts (he knows school is unnecessary in any form) he gets, he just wants some &quot;Structure&quot; for them. Take their hands and show them new things they couldn&#39;t find on their own.  Of course!  I think  I probably focused too much on the freedom early on when we really discussed it together and since school age was so far away he just let it go.  But as my understanding evolved I haven&#39;t  let him in on that particular evolution of thought.  He is willing to read stuff I email him so long as I don&#39;t send too much.  I don&#39;t need to unschool, if DH feels better without that label as long as my boys are respected as people with opinions and individuals we can make it work.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe service, chores/gift, and gratitude pages of Sandra&#39;s site have been my favorites since I found them.  I&#39;m a terrible housekeeper by my mother&#39;s standards but I&#39;ve been able to shift my attitiude and do what&#39;s necessary with joy and both of my boys not only help but will initiate cleaning.  (Is there anything sweeter than a 5 year old saying &quot;Momma, can I do the dishes?&quot;  cleanliness is SO not a learned behavior!)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would make DH happier if I could keep the house cleaner though.  That wasn&#39;t possible for a long time but I finally got diagnosed as severely hypothyroid a few months ago and I have the energy to do it now. I can find ways to reestablish housekeeping as a higher priority for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband had a sad and lonely childhood.  Sometimes I forget that he&#39;s got a really big hole to fill there.  He is much needier than I am.  He does work hard to provide a good paycheck at a job he doesn&#39;t love so I can stay home with the boys.  I do thank him for that, but not often enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have the fairly classic roles of male provider, female homemaker and mother.  Being reminded that the role of &quot;daddy&quot; is fairly new is a great reminder to be grateful for the time he does spend with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love the reminder from Mary to look for thing to be grateful for AND things I can do for him.  After I wrote this post I did walk around and ask myself what I could to to &quot;say I love you&quot; for him, I ended up cleaning his desk and plugging in his wireless headphones.  So simple but I felt better and he noticed and appreciated it.  I&#39;ve done that occasionally but doing it daily would be so much better!<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the reminder from Sandra that it is a new expectation it was so helpful to think about why I expected/wanted him to spend more time with the boys.  Partially I&#39;m jealous that he gets to sit down and do exactly what he wants for hours with very few interruptions.  A lot is that I know the boys are so happy when they do get focused attention from daddy.  I never considered it before but he probably isn&#39;t very comfortable in his role as daddy.  He knows  he doesn&#39;t want to be like his father but I haven&#39;t built up his confidence by correcting his every misttep (I&#39;ve been a lot better about that the last year or two but the dynamic was probably too firmly established already).<br/>\n<br/>\nHe does know I want more time with him and I know with two little boys we won&#39;t get a lot but so many of the opportunities we do have he seems to almost actively avoid by going to bed early (he&#39;s a night owl, going to bed early used to only happen when he was sick and now seems to also happen when he&#39;s frustrated with me or the boys) or just spending the whole time on his computer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will be more welcoming, I will stop criticizing his choices that are different than mine (not even in my head).  I will be more present when he is with the boys so I can redirect when they do start to frustrate each other (and I will find a way to do it without it being a critique of him!  Milkshakes anyone?) so playtime is more fun for everyone and maybe he&#39;ll want to do it more or at least it won&#39;t end in frustration.  I will look for the sweet and kind and lovable things about him and let them crowd out the parts I don&#39;t.  I will be sweeter and softer and kinder.  I will NOT send a bill or expect a response.  The home will be sweeter and softer and kinder because *I* have changed.  Anything further is bonus.  I will reread this daily and then weekly until I no longer need the reminder.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all SO much.  I can do this.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"Alex & Brian Polikowsky","from":"Alex & Brian Polikowsky &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: About marriage, attitude, hope?","postDate":"1448573286","msgId":76346,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgyQ0Q0MzE1LTY5MUEtNDQzNi1BRjE3LTM4OThGMTMxQzZENkB5YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PEIxMDM1RjkxLTZERTAtNEM0MC1BNDNGLTRCMjBBQjI3MkM1NUB5YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDkyNTQzNjY0LTc3REItNERGMy1COTQwLUU3MTEwRkI5MTQ4M0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPG4zNmZhait0Z3VqNzZAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPiA8REMyNkVBMjQtQzQwMS00NzQwLUFBQjUtRERFQkQyODk0RjdGQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8bjM3azQ2KzE0aXVrcTZAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NEFDMEI3OEUtMzE0Ni00QjhDLUJCRTMtODc3QzQwMDI0RkRDQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8QjEwMzVGOTEtNkRFMC00QzQwLUE0M0YtNEIyMEFCMjcyQzU1QHlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":76345,"nextInTopic":76349,"prevInTime":76345,"nextInTime":76347,"topicId":76327,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I meant to say : Liking for the positive And Don t look for flaws!

You have made a judgement about your husband (&#39;self-centered and selfish with his time&#39;)....Some people need more self-time than other people---maybe your husband is one of those people. It sounds like you&#39;d like him to spend more time with your boys, is that because you need time to yourself and would appreciate his taking care of the kids? Is it because you see that your boys want more time and attention from their dad? Could it be that he doesn&#39;t feel confident in his role as their dad & he&#39;s not sure how he fits in, so he stays away? Is it because of another reason? <br/>\n<br/>\n(by Mary / clovis70…)<br/>\n____________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband wasn’t very helpful when very young children.  He DID go to work early and often.  And he’s an introvert, so being “on” at work for eight hours really did require some alone-time for him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/introvert\">http://sandradodd.com/introvert</a><br/>\nThe page starts “What if your child is…”  <br/>\nbut what if the little boy inside your husbad is an introvert?  Important to consider<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the question of why you want him to spend more time with the boys made me wonder (even aside from the clock measurement) whether you’re weighing his time against yours and resentful that it’s not 50/50.   <br/>\n<br/>\n50/50 is a horrible trap.<br/>\nHere’s something I wrote (about something I wrote): <br/>\n_______________<br/>\nA friend got married recently and I wrote down some advice for them that I hadn&#39;t ever thought before:<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t aim for 50/50.  <br/>\nIf 50% is right, then 49% is wrong, and 65% would be something get angry about.<br/>\nIf you both aim for more than half, you&#39;ll meet around the middle, around half the time. If you want the other person to stick around, &quot;around&quot; is the goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the mom learns and then demonstrates that giving can make a person feel happy, *then* she might have children who are also generous and kind. If the mom acts pouty and whiney and martyrly, she will have children who are confused and needy and resentful. <br/>\n________________<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: About marriage, attitude, hope?","postDate":"1448562635","msgId":76340,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERDMjZFQTI0LUM0MDEtNDc0MC1BQUI1LURERUJEMjg5NEY3RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG4zNmZhait0Z3VqNzZAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDkyNTQzNjY0LTc3REItNERGMy1COTQwLUU3MTEwRkI5MTQ4M0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPG4zNmZhait0Z3VqNzZAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":76338,"nextInTopic":76341,"prevInTime":76339,"nextInTime":76341,"topicId":76327,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I know Karen went on to say later, maybe say…   but this jumped up and scared me: -=-If he smiles at the boys a certain way, and you like the way that looks,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-528142440\">I know Karen went on to say later, maybe say…   but this jumped up and scared me:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-If he smiles at the boys a certain way, and you like the way that looks, soften into it.

I also got to a point where I wanted him to be happy, even if it meant divorce.

I tried harder to love him and be sweet, even when he wasn&#39;t sweet and I didn&#39;t FEEL sweet. At first this was hard, but soon it got easier. When he was grumpy or said something hurtful, I heard the hurt he was feeling, rather than just focusing on my own hurt. <br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-587135995yui_3_16_0_1_1448555094809_6116\" dir=\"ltr\"><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-587135995yui_3_16_0_1_1448555094809_6276\" dir=\"ltr\">I did also work at more honesty, though. There is venting, but there is also calm honest expression that can bring you closer. We both acknowledged that marrying all those years ago was probably a mistake.

He’s there playing with his boys a little bit, and that might increase if the home is a more peaceful, joyful, welcoming place to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he’s not fooling around or spending money on other women, that’s good.  Some husbands do that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd maybe your husband is needier than you are.  It’s possible that he’s thinkig that you hardly focus any attention on him.<br/>\n<br/>\nMen’s roles are changing, too, but in no tradition before have men been expected to play with their children more than five hours a week, or even ONE hour a week.  Seriously.  Look at real history and the real world more than at fantasy wishful made-up ideals.   Some families do find a lot of time together after a while, but it take that time being inviting, more than someone setting rules and looking at the clock and telling the other spouse “not enough; you failed again.”<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd IF he’s bringing his paycheck home and so you can stay with your boys, that’s a luxury most women don’t have.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSmiling is contagious.  Moods spread.  If you smile at him more, and thank him for things he does, and say nice things to him and about him, things will be better already.  As you do it more, he will relax and maybe feel some gratitude, too.  Not immediately.  Don’t look at the clock and don’t measure.  At first it might seem awkward and false, and it might be, but if you keep being positive and kind, there will be more positivity and kindness in your life, his life, and your kids’ lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] About marriage, attitude, hope?","postDate":"1448554729","msgId":76334,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQyQzQxN0I2LTdGMkQtNDNGOC1BODZGLUVGODAwMjk4MUI0QUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDkyNTQzNjY0LTc3REItNERGMy1COTQwLUU3MTEwRkI5MTQ4M0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDkyNTQzNjY0LTc3REItNERGMy1COTQwLUU3MTEwRkI5MTQ4M0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":76333,"nextInTopic":76335,"prevInTime":76333,"nextInTime":76335,"topicId":76327,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I went down one trail in a previous e-mail.

If ideas aren’t needed or useful in the next twelve hours, imagine how they might possibly be useful in the future, and don’t brush them aside.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople have a stance, emotionally.  Some call it “where you’re coming from.”  Where are you at rest, in the moment, looking around.<br/>\nReligions can create a stance for people—an at-rest starting place of the heart and soul.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people live with little or no religion, or when a person is moving away from prescribed social roles and ways of being, one large problem is that they might not know where they’re coming from, or where they are.  Sometimes their behaviors and thoughts are reactionary—a wad of “yeah but” thoughts, nervously and unclearly half-articulated.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWithout a religious or cultural definition and image of how a wife is supposed to see her relationship with her husband and children (and community, and God), answers might be sought from some facebook group of unschooling parents. :-)   There are worse places to ask for ideas.  But it IS part of a changing world, that people puzzle these things out in individual ways, and sometimes it’s botched.<br/>\n<br/>\nOF COURSE, yes, I know, some of you are thinking that there are disasters and failed marriages and botch jobs when the husband and wife both play out the ideal socio-religious roles of a lifetime.  Yes.  But in those cases, it wasn’t your fault. It will be seen as bad luck falling on good people.   Any departure from the common path is a danger, and anyone who thinks you shouldn’t have done that will blame the departure, the hubris, the “who do you think you are?”<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that’s the question I’m working around to:  Who do you think you are?<br/>\nIf you’re a parent of children, then they need things.  They need an intact family, if possible.  They need food, shelter, safety, comfort, maybe happiness.<br/>\nIf you’re seeing yourself increasingly as “an unschooling parent,” it’s vital to know (for you to know) whether your spouse is interested in becoming one of those, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf (as for many parents) the children are grubs and future humans who are seen as resilient creatures who won’t remember much of their childhood later, and if you don’t like this partner, maybe you and the kids will like the next one you find, then the decisions become about the mom and her “happiness.”<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes second marriages are great!  Sometimes they’re just a lead-in to third marriages.<br/>\nOften they’re pretty similar to the the first marriage, because some of the problems of the first marriage reside in or were caused by this person who moves to the second marriage (or third, fourth), learning too late that if she’s changed those behaviors and beliefs in the first marriage, she could still have those family photos out in public, and would be having a tenth or fifteenth anniversary coming up, rather than a second anniversary of a marriage that needed to be planned so that the date didn’t remind her of the anniversary of the first marriage, or the second.  Second marriages don’t erase the ex-husband, former inlaws, or custody sharing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone asks for help when she already has her emotional bags packed and her spirit is standing with the door open, wanting other people to tell her to step out and close it, she’s probably leaving regardless of the response.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone truly wants help to stay, there is a lot of possibility for help with the thoughts that might help.<br/>\n<br/>\nONE-ON-ONE HELP:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/issues/therapy\">http://sandradodd.com/issues/therapy</a>  (unschooling-knowledgeable counselors and coaches who can help at a distance)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nREADINGS:<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you’re considering a separation:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/separation\">http://sandradodd.com/separation</a>  (other people’s thoughtful writing from former discussions)<br/>\n<br/>\nDivorce (prevention of, for unschoolers) <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/divorce\">http://sandradodd.com/divorce</a> (written by an unschooling mom with a great second marriage, and deep regrets)<br/>\n<br/>\nSpouses  &quot;Unschooling can make us better partners!”    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/spouses\">http://sandradodd.com/spouses</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTrying not to control a spouse:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/control.html#spouses\">http://sandradodd.com/control.html#spouses</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThose have links.

I have spent years with much distance from my husband because he ended up not being the Man-I-Wished-I-Had-Married (and I was not the Wife-He-Wished-He-Had-Married). I wasted lots of time complaining to friends about how marrying him was the worst mistake I&#39;d ever made. Although I always felt appreciative of the children we&#39;ve had together.<div><br></div><div>Our lives are different now, for which I am very thankful! There are 2 things that have helped make this change happen: 3+1 assignment and couples therapy.</div><div><br></div><div>The 3+1 assignment was a suggestion a trusted friend gave me. Every evening, I look through my day and locate 3 items about my husband that I am thankful for, appreciate of, or like about him and one item that I have done through the day to be of service to him (the helpful type of service, not being a servant of his) with the intent of saving my marriage. I email this assignment to my trusted friend every day. The way that this assignment has made a difference for me is that my attention is on what I like about him rather than what I don&#39;t like (which is what I thought about day &amp; night for years). For me, it has been important to have the accountability to send my assignment to someone else. The thing about this assignment is that my focus has been on myself &amp; what I can change about me (not what I think he needs to do differently).</div><div><br></div><div>We have tried different couples therapists over the years. Some have been a good fit, others not so much. The one we currently work with has proven to be very helpful. What happens there is that we can each talk through our resentments/frustrations with each other with the therapist helping interpret what the other person is saying/where the other person is coming from. I mention this because it&#39;s the place where I can voice my complaints about his behavior and how I feel about those times and he can hear what I&#39;m trying to communicate underneath the complaint. There&#39;s something different that happens during those appointments: &nbsp;the therapist helps us see our defense mechanisms and understand what the other person is trying to communicate. This is something we have not been successful doing on our own, but we are learning those skills with the therapist &amp; I have confidence that when we&#39;re done, we can take those skills with us. One important piece of this is *my* pattern of walking into a situation with my husband with an assumption about him (note,again, this is something I can change about myself), and he has his own assumptions about me and it&#39;s been difficult for us to set those assumptions aside on our own so that we can talk through what happened without that gunk built up from years of distance and dysfunction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;line-height:1.25;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;line-height:1.25;\">&lt;&lt;More specifically he is very self centered and selfish with his time typically spending less than 5 hours a week playing with his boys and I&#39;m lucky if I get any focused attention at all.&gt;&gt;</span><br></div><div><span style=\"word-spacing:normal;line-height:1.25;\"><br></span></div><div>^^^This part of your post stuck out to me. You have made a judgement about your husband (&#39;self-centered and selfish with his time&#39;)....Some people need more self-time than other people---maybe your husband is one of those people. It sounds like you&#39;d like him to spend more time with your boys, is that because you need time to yourself and would appreciate his taking care of the kids? Is it because you see that your boys want more time and attention from their dad? Could it be that he doesn&#39;t feel confident in his role as their dad &amp; he&#39;s not sure how he fits in, so he stays away? Is it because of another reason?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Also, you imply that you&#39;d like more time with your husband. Have you told him that you are missing him and would like some alone time with him? Can you arrange a date night with him (either with a sitter for your kids or after your kids are asleep)? I know your kids are young and those things (date night/alone time) were really hard for my husband and me to coordinate when our kids were that young. For our 15th anniversary, my husband planned a surprise weekend away for us---it&#39;s the first time we&#39;ve been away from our kids ever. It was lovely! Interestingly, we met a couple who were celebrating their 25th anniversary &amp; it&#39;s the first time they&#39;d been away from their kids--I appreciated that comparison.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I hope my experience is helpful for

By the will of God you would see things improving, if you remain patient and be steadfast with your plan.</div><div dir=\"ltr\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-1927463254yui_3_16_0_1_1448514305530_3276\"><br></div><div dir=\"ltr\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-1927463254yui_3_16_0_1_1448514305530_3276\">As for the plan, I would relate a real story about a person whom one of my teacher met.

Living together they had kids. However, the husband had a change of heart at some point in time and began feeling bad about his lifestyle and the lack of any purpose and started becoming a more Godly person. However, his wife continued with the old ways which he couldn&#39;t bear and perhaps had a number of arguments with her. Not knowing how to address it, he approached an advisor and asked for advise. The advise that he gave was to never say a word about her ways which he did not like but try to become the best husband and to become the best father that he could without any expectation from her. Very soon he could see his wife noticing the changes in her husband and then it happened..... Once it was that he was doing his prayers and his wife sat besides him joining him in the prayer.&nbsp;</div><div dir=\"ltr\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-1927463254yui_3_16_0_1_1448514305530_3276\"><br></div><div dir=\"ltr\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-1927463254yui_3_16_0_1_1448514305530_3276\">I know it is easier said than done, but this is a true story and it can be done with some patience and perseverance.&nbsp;<br></div><div dir=\"ltr\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-1927463254yui_3_16_0_1_1448514305530_3276\"><br></div><div dir=\"ltr\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-1927463254yui_3_16_0_1_1448514305530_3276\">May the blessings of God be upon you.</div><div dir=\"ltr\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-1927463254yui_3_16_0_1_1448514305530_3276\"><br></div><div dir=\"ltr\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-1927463254yui_3_16_0_1_1448514305530_3276\">Regards</div><div dir=\"ltr\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-1927463254yui_3_16_0_1_1448514305530_3276\"><br></div><div dir=\"ltr\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-1927463254yui_3_16_0_1_1448514305530_3276\">Saood</div><br>  <div style=\"font-family:garamond, new york, times, serif;font-size:16px;\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-1927463254yui_3_16_0_1_1448514305530_3205\"> <div style=\"font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, Sans-Serif;font-size:16px;\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-1927463254yui_3_16_0_1_1448514305530_3204\"> <div dir=\"ltr\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-1927463254yui_3_16_0_1_1448514305530_3203\"> <hr size=\"1\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-1927463254yui_3_16_0_1_1448514305530_3425\"> <font size=\"2\" face=\"Arial\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-1927463254yui_3_16_0_1_1448514305530_3202\"> <b><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">From:</span></b> &quot;Sandra Dodd Sandra@...

I&#39;ve been reading about and trying out unschooling principles since our oldest was about 6 months old.  I have always loved to learn new things and have actively pursued many varied interests so academic unschooling made perfect sense to me from the beginning.  It took quite a bit longer for me to really begin to understand the importance of the relationships along with everything else but it&#39;s coming much easier to view my real children and interact with Them instead of the Imaginary children I might sometimes wish I had.<br clear=\"none\">\n<br clear=\"none\">\nIt&#39;s still really hard for me to look at my husband and see Him and not the Man-I-Wished-I&#39;d-Married (or rather how he falls short of that).  <br clear=\"none\">\n<br clear=\"none\">\nEarlier this year we went through a really rough patch that hit me out of the blue and made me suddenly afraid that our marriage might not only not last forever but not even last the year.  He assures me that he doesn&#39;t want to leave but I&#39;m finding my thoughts full of awful things like I never really loved him and I married him for the wrong reasons and I should have known from the beginning that I shouldn&#39;t have married him, let alone had two children with him.  I have made good enough progress on being kind that I&#39;ve managed to avoid saying any of that out loud and I&#39;ve managed to avoid saying anything even in anger or hurt that I&#39;d wished I could take back.  <br clear=\"none\">\n<br clear=\"none\">\nHere&#39;s the main point of my question: I&#39;m not an explosive person and am far more prone to not saying things that I maybe should rather than hurt someone with my words.  Are there any times that complaining to a spouse about their behavior and how it makes me feel are actually helpful?  Or is that pretty much always putting more distance between us and would be better served to find ways to let go?  More specifically he is very self centered and selfish with his time typically spending less than 5 hours a week playing with his boys and I&#39;m lucky if I get any focused attention at all.<br

id=\"ygrps-yiv-367320418\">I have a request to post this anonymously.<br/>\n________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never posted to a email list group before and I&#39;d like for this to be anonymous so I&#39;m hoping you can post this to Always Learning for me,  I know it&#39;s not specifically unschooling but repairing this marriage will make the difference between whether we can unschool or not and I don&#39;t know anywhere better to help me get back to a positive place and help me see where my thinking is stuck in distancing rather than bonding and repairing places.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur boys are 5 and 21 months.  I&#39;ve been reading about and trying out unschooling principles since our oldest was about 6 months old.  I have always loved to learn new things and have actively pursued many varied interests so academic unschooling made perfect sense to me from the beginning.  It took quite a bit longer for me to really begin to understand the importance of the relationships along with everything else but it&#39;s coming much easier to view my real children and interact with Them instead of the Imaginary children I might sometimes wish I had.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s still really hard for me to look at my husband and see Him and not the Man-I-Wished-I&#39;d-Married (or rather how he falls short of that).  <br/>\n<br/>\nEarlier this year we went through a really rough patch that hit me out of the blue and made me suddenly afraid that our marriage might not only not last forever but not even last the year.  He assures me that he doesn&#39;t want to leave but I&#39;m finding my thoughts full of awful things like I never really loved him and I married him for the wrong reasons and I should have known from the beginning that I shouldn&#39;t have married him, let alone had two children with him.  I have made good enough progress on being kind that I&#39;ve managed to avoid saying any of that out loud and I&#39;ve managed to avoid saying anything even in anger or hurt that I&#39;d wished I could take back.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the main point of my question: I&#39;m not an explosive person and am far more prone to not saying things that I maybe should rather than hurt someone with my words.  Are there any times that complaining to a spouse about their behavior and how it makes me feel are actually helpful?  Or is that pretty much always putting more distance between us and would be better served to find ways to let go?  More specifically he is very self centered and selfish with his time typically spending less than 5 hours a week playing with his boys and I&#39;m lucky if I get any focused attention at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________<br/>\n<br/>\nEnd of the quote.<br/>\nIf there are new members here who want to jump up and recommend divorce, please don’t.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76970,"nextTopicId":76989}}
