If you want an original Spiderman, Pokemon, etc they aren&#39;t going to be a part of the give away. Basically anything of high value, they will be newer comics. He did not mention if there was a limit to the number of comics that can be obtained. I would suggest calling your local stores to find out their specific restrictions if any.
