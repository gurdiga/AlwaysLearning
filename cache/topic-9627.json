Maybe UUs don&#39;t get many kids without their <br/>\n&gt; parents, but I knew other kids whose parents were pretty worthless to them <br/>\n&gt; religiously speaking.  So if you count on the family beng the experience <br/>\n&gt; for <br/>\n&gt; every kid, some will lose out.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (Probably they will find other families or adults to use for that learning <br/>\n&gt; purpose, though.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In my experience, we don&#39;t get too many kids without their parents on <br/>\nSaturday morning (Youth Group is different).  However, even among UU&#39;s, kids <br/>\noften diverge spiritually from their parents as they grow. UU&#39;s tend to be <br/>\nmore okay about that, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn writing this, I wanted to be clear to other Religious Educators that <br/>\nhowever good their programs might be, we were NOT the primary religious <br/>\neducators of the kids. From an early age, kids ask their parents (or someone <br/>\nelse -- I suppose many kids learn about spirituality &quot;on the streets&quot;) <br/>\nquestions like &quot;What happens when you die? Is there a God, &quot; etc. (There&#39;s a <br/>\ncool UU Adult RE curriculum called &quot;Parents as Resident Theologians.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI see what we do in Sunday school as providing community, and giving <br/>\nresources and ideas for exploration...it&#39;s up to the kids to figure out what <br/>\ntheir next steps are, and we&#39;re always there to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, they won&#39;t fire me, because the congregation I serve is REALLY into this <br/>\nstuff. When I first started with this church, I told the board that if it <br/>\ncame down to it, I&#39;d advocate for what the kids want. They LOVED it!<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce asked me if we unschool RE at my church, and truthfully, we don&#39;t. With <br/>\nvolunteer teachers and expectations from both the parents and the kids, I <br/>\nhaven&#39;t figured out how to pull that off. However, I&#39;ve tried really hard to <br/>\nat least respect what the kids want. I asked last Spring what they wanted to <br/>\nlearn this year, and lots said--Science. So my partner and I are writing a <br/>\ncurriculum (with lots of choices in it) about Science and Religion.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the feedback.<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9614,"nextTopicId":9628}}
