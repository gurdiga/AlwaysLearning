For three years I have felt like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; her slave. It has been extremely difficult to find the &quot;joy&quot; in mothering<br/>\n&gt; &gt; her. With me she is needy and demanding. With my husband, her grandparents,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; aunts, and other relatives, she gives them a break. I feel a lot of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; resentment about that. Her emotional demands on me are never ending. It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like she expects me to &quot;on&quot;, perfect, and infallible at all times. I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; supposed to talk on the phone, use the computer, read the mail, let the dog<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out, run errands, make meals, clean the house, pay bills, or direct my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; attention to anything but her... EVER. EVER. EVER. Forget getting dressed in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more than 3 minutes, actually taking a second to look in the mirror, or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sleeping an entire night without her waking me. And I don&#39;t even have the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; energy to get into the extended breastfeeding discussion. Basically, if I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could cut off my breasts so that she would stop nursing to sleep - I WOULD.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have nothing left for me and nothing left for my husband. We just got<br/>\n&gt; &gt; back from a weekend-long marriage counseling retreat (Retrouvaille - I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; highly recommend it and learned about it on the unschooling partnerships<br/>\n&gt; &gt; group) and it is suddenly so clear to me that my constant giving to our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; daughter has come at the expense of my own sanity and the future viability<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of our marriage. I don&#39;t want to lose my spouse, and I especially don&#39;t want<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to lose myself! In my daughter&#39;s absence this weekend (the first time we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have ever spent apart), I was able to feel a great sense of freedom,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; personhood, individuality, and self determination. In order for my marriage<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to work well, I need to feel good about me, in order to feel good about my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; husband.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am determined to make a change in my life, so that I can be a better<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wife, and in being a better wife, a better mother. It would be much easier<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to keep things the way they are, because that doesn&#39;t require action and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; planning and FEAR that i&#39;m doing the Wrong thing, making the wrong choice.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But I so want to be a better person, for my husband and for myself, and I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; think that making a change in my relationship with my daughter is going to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be necessary to do that. I can not be her Everything if I am going to have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; enough left over for my spouse and myself.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I read suggestions, weekly at least, to get a mothers&#39; helper a few hours a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; week, or switch off with babysitting someone else&#39;s kids, or get a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; babysitter every so often. Folks, that&#39;s not going to cut it. My time away<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from my daughter this weekend left me wanting more - So Much More. I didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; want to come back. I Really Need A Break.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please understand that I really DO BELIEVE in unschooling and it kills me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that I am highly considering sending her to a program (one trained<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Montessori teacher, in her home, five kids, Montessori classroom set-up in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; her living room, playroom and kitchen, 3 hours in the morning, 3 or 5 days a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; week). In no way would I be sending her because &quot;it&#39;s good for her&quot;. She&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rather be at home, of course. And she has no need to go to a school-like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; setting or someone else&#39;s home to learn. And I&#39;d hate myself for taking away<br/>\n&gt; &gt; her opportunity to be &quot;Always Unschooled&quot;.

I am so overcommitted<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to her, there is absolutely nothing left in me for myself or others.

This post has really struck a nerve with me! <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I agree with Sandra on many points.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your child is 2 years old. She cannot do many things on her own. She needs you! You are not her slave! You are a mom!!!! Seems like you aren&#39;t fit to be a mom, to me. I hate to be harsh, but you don&#39;t sound like a loving mom.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Was your child planned?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I feel truly sorry for your child and not for you at all. You have the ability and the resources to raise your child with love and to give her everything she needs, but apparently, the one thing she needs the most is unconditional love from her mother. It seems that you cannot give this to your child, or you don&#39;t want to do so. Being a parent to a very young child is demanding at times, can be hard at times. My son has severe Asperger&#39;s Syndrome and I&#39;m sure you have read about parenting autistic children. He&#39;s far more demanding and difficult than your daughter seems, but with every motion and everything I do, I love him unconditionally and I do not ever resent him. I don&#39;t see myself as a slave, especially when he was 2 years old!!!!It also seems to me that your daughter might sense the resentment and lack of unconditional love and she&#39;s reaching out, demanding that love!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One more thing, why is your husband not parenting your child also? Your child is 2 years old. She does not understand the concepts of &quot;being on&quot; or what not (the other things you mentioned). Seems like you have more issues than we are seeing here. Don&#39;t put so much onto your child. Don&#39;t assume she&#39;s thinking at a higher level. She&#39;s acting on instinct and she wants her mom to love her fully and to keep her full. You are her best friend, her confidant and her love. Give into her fully and stop resenting the most wonderful person in your life!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rachael_copp_cohen&quot; &lt;r.copp.cohen@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am in Crisis and need guidance from a group of people who I truly trust and admire, though I just cannot seem to emulate. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -------------  I am crossposting this message (I also sent it to Always Unschooled) because I sense two very different atmospheres in these groups and although there is overlap in membership, I feel it is likely I will get very different answers from each. ---------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; My daughter is turning 3 in three weeks.

I don&#39;t want to lose my spouse, and I especially don&#39;t want to lose myself!  In my daughter&#39;s absence this weekend (the first time we have ever spent apart), I was able to feel a great sense of freedom, personhood, individuality, and self determination.

In no way would I be sending her because &quot;it&#39;s good for her&quot;.  She&#39;d rather be at home, of course.

This is the validation I was looking for.  Yes, perhaps I posted just to get validation.  There is no one else in my real world that would have been able to give me that validation.  I needed &quot;permission&quot;, if you will, from the group of people that I have been measuring my &quot;success&quot; against.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;So, why did you choose to breastfeed? Why not put her on formula, and put her in daycare at birth? At some point you chose to be this sort of mother. The baby didn&#39;t choose to breastfeed, and would have taken soy or dairy based formula or whatever alternative is out there if she were allergic.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI chose to breastfeed to give her the healthiest start in life.  Because as parents, especially as mothers, we have a duty to give our children the best that we can.  I have breasts that make milk (FAR FAR TOO MUCH, which was the initial cause of most of my resentment over breastfeeding -- the Pain, ongoing, every day, without end), so I nursed her, despite the never-ending mastitis, tender nipples (to this day), and flowing fountains of sticky mess.  I didn&#39;t see stopping as an option.  How could I stop?  Why did I have a child if not to nurse her?  I get your point.  But as a new mother, that point would not have, could not have, resonated with me.  And I am still a new mother, and it is still hard for me to &quot;let go&quot; of the imperfections and be OK with them.  In life I am a perfectionist.  Clearly that has carried over to the role of mothering.   <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Is it only recently that parenting her using attachment parenting or unschooling as though it were a recipe or secret formula for success has stressed you out? Did you just not believe in it? My kids nursed forever, constantly and we connected. If you feel angry and resentful that&#39;s not the same as tired, frustrated and in need of a break. Are you ranting or venting? We have all been there...in need of a break. You seem to have set parameters for suggestions, so I am not answering your post but simply asking you to ask yourself if you believe unschooling(a vague enough term as it is) is so great and why?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nNo, I have been a stressed out mess from day one.  I sometimes wonder how life would have been different if I had never read AP books.  When I come upon something that strikes me as right or good (ie environmental stewardship, healthy eating,) I am going to make every effort under the sun to commit myself to it.  That is me.  I am intense, passionate, and head-strong.  (YES, I recognize the parallels in my daughter! :)  So I committed to raising my daughter with my whole self, following the guidelines of AP, and then I found unschooling to be a natural next step. (But of course, until she is school-age, I recognize that it is an irrelevant label.)  But unlike when I reduce my energy consumption or eat vegetarian, I can&#39;t actually control what happens on the other end of AP/unschooling.  So to answer your question, I am resentful and angry (as well as tired and frustrated) Precisely Because I believe so strongly in the greatness of AP/unschooling, Because I have done my absolute best and given of myself as freely as I have been able to (while - clearly unsuccessfully - attempting to create boundaries and space for myself), and yet ultimately feel like a failure.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo there you go - the answer is that I have felt stressed out from the beginning because no matter how hard I have tried to do things &quot;the right way&quot; (according to Me, not to others!), I just couldn&#39;t seem to succeed.  So did that make it a rant or a vent?  I don&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut thanks for listening.<br/>\nRachael<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Marina DeLuca-Howard &lt;delucahoward@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you started feeling like her slave while she was inutero, you probably<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t been acting like a loving mama.

You are not her slave! You are a mom!!!! Seems like you aren&#39;t fit to be a mom, to me. I hate to be harsh, but you don&#39;t sound like a loving mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nWas your child planned?<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel truly sorry for your child and not for you at all. You have the ability and the resources to raise your child with love and to give her everything she needs, but apparently, the one thing she needs the most is unconditional love from her mother. It seems that you cannot give this to your child, or you don&#39;t want to do so. Being a parent to a very young child is demanding at times, can be hard at times. My son has severe Asperger&#39;s Syndrome and I&#39;m sure you have read about parenting autistic children. He&#39;s far more demanding and difficult than your daughter seems, but with every motion and everything I do, I love him unconditionally and I do not ever resent him. I don&#39;t see myself as a slave, especially when he was 2 years old!!!!It also seems to me that your daughter might sense the resentment and lack of unconditional love and she&#39;s reaching out, demanding that love!<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more thing, why is your husband not parenting your child also? Your child is 2 years old. She does not understand the concepts of &quot;being on&quot; or what not (the other things you mentioned). Seems like you have more issues than we are seeing here. Don&#39;t put so much onto your child. Don&#39;t assume she&#39;s thinking at a higher level. She&#39;s acting on instinct and she wants her mom to love her fully and to keep her full. You are her best friend, her confidant and her love. Give into her fully and stop resenting the most wonderful person in your life!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rachael_copp_cohen&quot; &lt;r.copp.cohen@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am in Crisis and need guidance from a group of people who I truly trust and admire, though I just cannot seem to emulate. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -------------  I am crossposting this message (I also sent it to Always Unschooled) because I sense two very different atmospheres in these groups and although there is overlap in membership, I feel it is likely I will get very different answers from each. ---------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My daughter is turning 3 in three weeks.

She had met<br/>\nanother mother with twins who was really cool and was exclusively<br/>\nbreastfeeding two kids.  But this mother was having trouble--sleeplessness,<br/>\nthe constant demands and expectations were getting to her.  My comment was<br/>\nFormula has saved many babies, and there is no solution.  If you don&#39;t or<br/>\ncannot do this, relax, it isn&#39;t a sin.  In your case there is also no<br/>\nsunshine lollipops Pollyanna solution.<br/>\nNow, this twin mother was worried that her kids would miss out on the great<br/>\nbenefit of breastfeeding and her husband had hired a housekeeper and two<br/>\ngrandmas were over making meals.  She and all the people around her expected<br/>\nher to succeed given all the help they were offering.  So she felt guilty.<br/>\nBut the choice she thought was the best choice, didn&#39;t work for her.  She<br/>\nwasn&#39;t a failure and didn&#39;t need to feel guilty.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are not a failure, and you shouldn&#39;t feel guilty.  You are living with<br/>\nyour partner and child, so whether you are the cool unschooling mother who<br/>\nis the partner, or the conventional mother who sends her kids to school is<br/>\nof no difference if you love your family and do your best.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, why did you choose to breastfeed?  Why not put her on formula, and put<br/>\nher in daycare at birth? At some point you chose to be this sort of mother.<br/>\n The baby didn&#39;t choose to breastfeed, and would have taken soy or dairy<br/>\nbased formula or whatever alternative is out there if she were allergic.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it only recently that parenting her using attachment parenting or<br/>\nunschooling as though it were a recipe or secret formula for success has<br/>\nstressed you out?

One was <br/>\nfinding choices, knowing that I was choosing what I was doing. I can remember <br/>\nwalking the dog one day, vaguely I remember that David and I had just had an <br/>\nargument, and I imagined myself renting a room from a farmhouse I passed and my <br/>\nlife without Simon and Linnaea and David. I thought I might take the dog. And I <br/>\ntold this story to myself of my life, my solo life and imagined the freedoms and <br/>\nthe liberties that I would have in this private existence. And when I went home <br/>\nI was so happy to be there, because I chose that, I chose being at home with <br/>\nSimon and Linnaea and David and I chose having them at home with me. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second was embracing being at home with Simon and Linnaea. Not resenting <br/>\nthem, honestly turning toward them in the most embracive and accepting way that <br/>\nI could. The more that I did that, and it took a lot of energy and refocusing to <br/>\nhush the distractions (similar ones to what you list: to talk  on the phone, use <br/>\nthe computer, read the mail, let the dog out,  run errands, make meals, clean <br/>\nthe house, pay bills) the more I enjoyed being with both of them, each of them. <br/>\nIt isn&#39;t happy, happy suck it up, it&#39;s truth that enjoying the small moments, <br/>\nthe little bits of life helped me to not feel so tired, so martyred, so whiney. <br/>\nIt&#39;s what I still do when I get tense in a moment, I turn toward them.

It seems simple but it can really change my whole outlook.  Take the money you would have spent sending her to preschool and use it for activities.  You just moved to a new place and there is tons to explore.  I&#39;m not sure where you are in NJ, but you cannot be more than 2 hours from NYC, PA, or the beach.  Plan some day trips.  Check out new playgrounds.  Try the museums.  Look for an ice cream shop.  Go to the movies.  Join the pool/YMCA.  Even if she is young, it might help you.  You might even meet people there.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids also seem to be able to be more independent after long outings.  They are ready to unwind.  They are willing to watch a movie or quietly play with toys.  After having my undivided attention for a few hours they seem calmer.  At home there are too many distractions for me and I find myself wandering from them both physically and mentally.<br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise, maybe you should put her in preschool.

At one time, breastfeeding was driving me sometimes","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1326172615\">Your daughter sounds very much like my son but I have somehow managed<br/>\nto come to different terms about it. At one time, breastfeeding was<br/>\ndriving me sometimes very batty. Certainly at 3, Karl had almost no<br/>\ndesire to play with other kids. Probably because he was still 3...<br/>\nbecause even in 3 year old kids who weren&#39;t (and likely never had<br/>\nbeen) breastfeeding, I&#39;ve noticed that the level of attachment is very<br/>\nsimilar ... every bit as far as you&#39;re talking about. What you&#39;re<br/>\nseeing in your daughter is normal. Kids do change just not immediately<br/>\nbut once they do change, it&#39;s remarkable how quickly changes take<br/>\nplace.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the time, I doubted that the level of attachment in Karl was<br/>\nnormal. People (in my own very distance, very child-unfriendly group<br/>\nof relatives) told me that I was allowing it and that&#39;s why it was<br/>\nhappening. But I noticed that their own kids only cried less or asked<br/>\nfor less because the parents were/are spankers and timeout/cry-it-out<br/>\nadvocates.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian (my partner) got a call from a co-worker we&#39;ve visited in the<br/>\npast. He was asking Brian what to do about his niece&#39;s &quot;constant&quot;<br/>\ncrying and noise-making. He and his wife are currently living with his<br/>\nbrother/sister-in-law and year old baby. The co-worker&#39;s wife is in<br/>\nnursing school and finds it impossible to study because of the noise.<br/>\nThey&#39;ve talked about this with Brian before-- quite a lot. They&#39;ve<br/>\nonly been living there about 6 months so far because they sold their<br/>\nhouse so they could handle their own bills/spending. The co-worker&#39;s<br/>\nwife grabbed the phone from her husband mid-sentence and talked<br/>\nnonstop at high volume for over 15 minutes, without taking a breath it<br/>\nseemed. She was sooooo upset and determined that the parents should be<br/>\ndisciplining this child. Brian didn&#39;t bother suggesting she could go<br/>\nto a cafe or library that has wi-fi or wear earplugs while studying at<br/>\nthe house. He just wanted to get off the phone.<br/>\n<br/>\nA little background... the nursing student is the oldest in her family<br/>\nand grew up in charge of 3 or 4 siblings. I&#39;d say her patience for<br/>\nchildren is well below nil. Her mom was seldom home due to a ministry<br/>\nof going from church to church fellowshipping/rehearsing/singing. We<br/>\nhave relatives in the same boat. One oldest child&#39;s estranged parents<br/>\nare running a coffee franchise and they seldom spend much time with<br/>\ntheir homeschooled kids. Their substitute is to shower them with gifts<br/>\nand money which they have a lot of. In both of those families, the<br/>\noldest child became the proxy for parent(s) who are remotely available<br/>\nby phone.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe nursing student is no longer directly responsible for children<br/>\n(thank goodness, I say). She&#39;s in need of attention that she will<br/>\nprobably never get because for one thing, I don&#39;t think she knows how<br/>\nto... she doesn&#39;t have lots of knowledge about caring for her own<br/>\nemotional needs and always leans on others to do that for her. The<br/>\nsame goes for the homeschooled child I just talked about, She&#39;s WAY<br/>\nmore emotionally dependent on others than her siblings are, who are<br/>\nalso in need of care they aren&#39;t getting.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt surprised/es me how much children actually need their parents<br/>\nemotionally, physically.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe think of going out by yourself to breathe free for a few moments<br/>\nsort of like going out to get groceries when the pantry is low. It<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t stay full all by itself. It needs to be done somewhat<br/>\nregularly. It&#39;s a fairly predictable part of your life. You know ahead<br/>\nof time that it will get empty and need a refill. It&#39;s simple once you<br/>\nfigure out how to carry it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same goes for taking care of a child&#39;s needs. They don&#39;t stay full<br/>\nby themselves and predictably need regular refills, which are fairly<br/>\nsimple once you figure out the what/how.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 8/3/10, rachael_copp_cohen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:r.copp.cohen@...\">r.copp.cohen@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I am in Crisis and need guidance from a group of people who I truly trust<br/>\n&gt; and admire, though I just cannot seem to emulate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -------------  I am crossposting this message (I also sent it to Always<br/>\n&gt; Unschooled) because I sense two very different atmospheres in these groups<br/>\n&gt; and although there is overlap in membership, I feel it is likely I will get<br/>\n&gt; very different answers from each. ---------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My daughter is turning 3 in three weeks.

With my husband, her<br/>\n&gt; grandparents, aunts, and other relatives, she gives them a break.  I feel a<br/>\n&gt; lot of resentment about that.  Her emotional demands  on me are never<br/>\n&gt; ending.  It&#39;s like she expects me to &quot;on&quot;, perfect, and infallible at all<br/>\n&gt; times.  I&#39;m not supposed to talk  on the phone, use the computer, read the<br/>\n&gt; mail, let the dog out, run errands, make meals, clean the house, pay bills,<br/>\n&gt; or direct my attention to anything but her...

We just got<br/>\n&gt; back from a weekend-long marriage counseling retreat (Retrouvaille - I<br/>\n&gt; highly recommend it and learned about it on the unschooling partnerships<br/>\n&gt; group) and it is suddenly so clear to me that my constant giving to our<br/>\n&gt; daughter has come at the expense of my own sanity and the future viability<br/>\n&gt; of our marriage.  I don&#39;t want to lose my spouse, and I especially don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; want to lose myself!  In my daughter&#39;s absence this weekend (the first time<br/>\n&gt; we have ever spent apart), I was able to feel a great sense of freedom,<br/>\n&gt; personhood, individuality, and self determination.  In order for my marriage<br/>\n&gt; to work well, I need to feel good about me, in order to feel good about my<br/>\n&gt; husband.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am determined to make a change in my life, so that I can be a better wife,<br/>\n&gt; and in being a better wife, a better mother.

Folks, that&#39;s not going to cut it.  My time away<br/>\n&gt; from my daughter this weekend left me wanting more - So Much More.  I didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; want to come back.

In no way would I be sending her because &quot;it&#39;s good for her&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; She&#39;d rather be at home, of course.

My daughter is turning 3 in","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1703721432\">I am in Crisis and need guidance from a group of people who I truly trust and admire, though I just cannot seem to emulate. <br/>\n<br/>\n-------------  I am crossposting this message (I also sent it to Always Unschooled) because I sense two very different atmospheres in these groups and although there is overlap in membership, I feel it is likely I will get very different answers from each. ---------------<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is turning 3 in three weeks.  For three years I have felt like her slave.  It has been extremely difficult to find the &quot;joy&quot; in mothering her.  With me she is needy and demanding.  With my husband, her grandparents, aunts, and other relatives, she gives them a break.  I feel a lot of resentment about that.  Her emotional demands  on me are never ending.  It&#39;s like she expects me to &quot;on&quot;, perfect, and infallible at all times.  I&#39;m not supposed to talk  on the phone, use the computer, read the mail, let the dog out, run errands, make meals, clean the house, pay bills, or direct my attention to anything but her... EVER.  EVER.  EVER.  Forget  getting dressed in more than 3 minutes, actually  taking a second to look in the mirror, or sleeping an entire night without her waking me.  And I don&#39;t even have the energy to get into the extended breastfeeding discussion.  Basically, if I could cut off my breasts so that she would stop nursing to sleep - I WOULD.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have nothing left for me and nothing left for my husband.  We just got back from a weekend-long marriage counseling retreat (Retrouvaille - I highly recommend it and learned about it on the unschooling partnerships group) and it is suddenly so clear to me that my constant giving to our daughter has come at the expense of my own sanity and the future viability of our marriage.  I don&#39;t want to lose my spouse, and I especially don&#39;t want to lose myself!  In my daughter&#39;s absence this weekend (the first time we have ever spent apart), I was able to feel a great sense of freedom, personhood, individuality, and self determination.  In order for my marriage to work well, I need to feel good about me, in order to feel good about my husband.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am determined to make a change in my life, so that I can be a better wife, and in being a better wife, a better mother.  It would be much easier to keep things the way  they are, because that doesn&#39;t require action and planning and FEAR  that i&#39;m doing the Wrong thing, making the wrong choice.  But I so want to be a better person, for my husband and for myself, and I think that making a change in my relationship with my daughter is going to be necessary to do that.  I can not be her Everything if I am going to have enough left over for my spouse and myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read suggestions, weekly at least, to get a mothers&#39; helper a few hours a week, or switch off with babysitting someone else&#39;s kids, or get a babysitter every so often.  Folks, that&#39;s not going to cut it.  My time away from my daughter this weekend left me wanting more - So Much More.  I didn&#39;t want to come back.  I Really Need A Break.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease understand that I really DO BELIEVE in unschooling and it kills me that I am highly considering sending her to a program (one trained Montessori teacher, in her home, five kids, Montessori classroom set-up in her living room, playroom and kitchen, 3  hours in the morning, 3 or 5 days a week).  In no way would I be sending her because &quot;it&#39;s good for her&quot;.  She&#39;d rather be at home, of course.  And she has no need to go to a school-like setting or someone else&#39;s home to learn.  And I&#39;d hate myself for taking away her opportunity to be &quot;Always Unschooled&quot;.  (And, it&#39;s not like we even actually have the money for it - but my wonderful husband recognizes the severity of the situation.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I truly do not feel like I can make it this way.  I am so overcommitted to her, there is absolutely nothing left in me for myself or others.  I need a break.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe just (this month) moved from Florida to NJ, so it&#39;s not like I have a support system, a group of friends or like-minded moms to lean on, or even knowledge about child-friendly options in the community.  It takes months, even years, to establish oneself in a community and begin to ask others for help in hard times.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat other option do I have besides sending her somewhere so I can have time to take care of myself?  I look forward to your words of wisdom and ask in advance, Please be kind.  This is a last ditch effort at making unschooling work.  It won&#39;t really be much help to me if you are harsh or judging, as all I have ever tried to do was my best, and I am my own worst critic.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you so much in advance,<br/>\nRachael</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56572,"nextTopicId":56753}}
