Here&#39;s a bit from a newspaper article, quoting the curator:<br/>\n<br/>\n**Born in 1917, Andrew Wyeth was too high-strung and his health too  <br/>\nprecarious to sit in a classroom, so he was home-schooled. &quot;His  <br/>\nimagination and restlessness were cultivated--today they might be  <br/>\nmedicated,&quot; says Ms. Foster.**<br/>\n<br/>\nThis connects, for me, with my son. Right now, he&#39;s the youngest (age  <br/>\n14) in the cast of a production of &quot;Cats&quot; that is getting rave  <br/>\nreviews and selling-out every performance. He&#39;s playing Mungojerrie,  <br/>\na role that requires tremendous energy, stamina and confidence.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso in the cast are some guys in their 20s who were remembering  <br/>\nworking with Ben when he was 8 in a musical version of the first  <br/>\nRedwall book. He drove them NUTS! They&#39;ve been telling stories about  <br/>\nhow he&#39;d just be so excited and loud and annoying all the time. I  <br/>\nremember how they complained about him and how the director would say  <br/>\n&quot;he&#39;s doing exactly what I want him to do.&quot; Thank goodness for that  <br/>\ndirector. He&#39;s also now in &quot;Cats,&quot; playing old Gus.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s a father of two energetic boys. He and I have tried to explain  <br/>\nto these 20-something guys that &quot;quiet&quot; doesn&#39;t automatically equal  <br/>\n&quot;good&quot; and that squashing a kid&#39;s energy and enthusiasm isn&#39;t the  <br/>\nonly way to &quot;deal&quot; with him.

My first year I used all ABEKA. The second and third year I used a unit study.  Then, came a baby with health problems and a lot less time to focus and keep up with the unit study.  Now the only structured curriculum I have for my 5th grader is ABEKA math, for my 8th grade daughter an 8th grade math book that she has finished and now she has asked me for a new one and some spelling book she found around the house and does on her own.  She reads A LOT and they both take dance, piano and soccer outside of the home.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I have been a &quot;stressed out&quot; mom who needs to get back on track with my kids.  My son seems angry and hyper a lot of the time.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I have been reading your messages and started trying unschooling on my own, but I am unsure if what I am doing is okay.  My son just plays on the computer all day and night long.  My daughter seems to balance everything out on her own.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Could someone give me some advice on where to start with the unschooling approach.  Or is it too late because of the ages of my two older kids and the damage that has been done?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Thanks,<br/>\n  Michelle<br/>\n<br/>\nBilly or Nancy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FUNLists@...\">FUNLists@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  The Maryland Home Education Association will hold its annual conference this<br/>\nSaturday, April 1 2006 at Anne Arundel Community College.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe conference this year is dedicated to the memory of Barbara Klein, a<br/>\nhomeschooling pioneer, co-founder of The Learning Community, and a personal<br/>\nfriend.<br/>\n<br/>\nMHEA started in 1980 and this is Maryland&#39;s oldest homeschooling conference.<br/>\nIt is also the only statewide conference that is truly inclusive and has<br/>\nsomething to offer for all homeschoolers regardless of religion,<br/>\nhomeschooling philosophy, or experience.
