It&#39;s  <br/>\nthe difference between being sorry and making atonement:<br/>\n<br/>\nChange.<br/>\nAnd once changed, if you talk about it be specific.

We took Seth out of the bed at 8 months, and then I night-weaned him at 10 months (I should have listened to Nate who held him for 5 minutes and then gave him to me and said, &quot;just nurse him!&quot;).  I see now those 45 minutes of him crying in my arms and my denying him what he needed as the point at which it became, solidly, &quot;Maria vs. Seth.&quot;  He stopped nursing around his first birthday when I would not allow him to bite me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo much to atone for, I feel.  Things seem to be getting better: I don&#39;t feel as guilty anymore, and he comes up to me randomly saying, &quot;Mommy, I love you.&quot;  Which makes me feel like I must be doing something right.  Trust seems to be rebuilding; by giving him more, he gives more to us, and others.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a Daily Groove post by Scott Noelle that really speaks to me: <br/>\n<br/>\n:: No Regrets ::<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you progress and become a wiser parent, you may at<br/>\ntimes feel regret that you didn&#39;t &quot;know better&quot; when<br/>\nyour children were younger.

If so, let Mother Nature inspire<br/>\nyou to a more hopeful perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you ever explored a wild forest and appreciated<br/>\nthe awesome way in which Life springs forth from the<br/>\nchaos? Then you know Mother Nature never regrets. She<br/>\nlearns as she goes and always makes the best of things<br/>\nas they are. She never looks back.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a tree takes root in the shadows, Mother Nature<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t regret giving it a &quot;sub-optimum&quot; start in<br/>\nlife. She trusts it will bend toward the Light and<br/>\nfind a way to thrive.

I  <br/>\nsubscribe to the wordsmith mailing list.  There&#39;s a website, too.    <br/>\nToday&#39;s word is &quot;atone.&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://wordsmith.org/words/atone.html\">http://wordsmith.org/words/atone.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt means &quot;to make amends for.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn these days the words &quot;atonement&quot; and &quot;amends&quot; live in church and  <br/>\nAlcoholics Anonymous, pretty much.<br/>\nWhen one atones for sin, the intent is to bring him back to God, &quot;back  <br/>\ninto the fold,&quot; or to be at peace with God.  To be at one with God.   <br/>\nThat last part is the linguistic basis of it I hadn&#39;t seen or heard  <br/>\nexplained before.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a recovering alcoholic or someone in any twelve-step program that  <br/>\ngrew out of AA &quot;makes amends,&quot; the idea is to make as much verbal or  <br/>\nother atonement as the other person might desire or accept, if the  <br/>\nother person is still alive or available.  (My summary; not straight  <br/>\nfrom the literature or traditional recommendations of the groups.)    <br/>\nThe purpose of amends is to bring the person back into the life of a  <br/>\nperson who has rejected him, sometimes.  Or to mend a relationship,  <br/>\neven just a little, which helps mend the soul and conscience of the  <br/>\n&quot;twelve stepper&quot; who has made the effort to acknowledge hurts he did  <br/>\nor failures caused by the focus on something other than being present  <br/>\nand supportive of other people.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn attachment parenting terms (used quite a bit in unschooling  <br/>\ndiscussions), it&#39;s being a partner instead of an adversary.  Being on  <br/>\nthe same team.  Being your child&#39;s support system.    Being present  <br/>\nwith your child.   Being present for your child.   With infants, La  <br/>\nLeche League used the term &quot;unit&quot;--the mother and child unit, or  <br/>\npair.  Those describe the temporary symbiotic single being of the  <br/>\ninfant and nursing mother.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling can evolve easily when that relationship exists between a  <br/>\nparent and child, and the mother takes care not to break the bonds.    <br/>\nSchool is the biggest bond-breaking machine ever created.   They break  <br/>\nsibling bonds too, when they can.  Even twins are separated into  <br/>\ndifferent classes (in my experience, having gone to school with twins  <br/>\nand taught several sets of twins).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a family comes to unschooling by a route other than attachment  <br/>\nparenting, the mother needs to atone.   She has parented in ways she  <br/>\nno longer is proud of or comfortable with.  The regret and sorrow  <br/>\naren&#39;t hard to muster, when one is trying to create a more peaceful  <br/>\nrelationship with a child.
