A big bottle for $4.99.<br/>\nIt&#39;s non-toxic and has no irritating smell and it really works on even old<br/>\nstains. My sister had some stains that she&#39;s been trying to get out for<br/>\nyears and she tried Folex and it finally did the trick.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour info-mmercial for the day. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4355,"nextTopicId":4371}}
