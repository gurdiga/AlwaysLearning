He does *not* like Peter<br/>\nJackson Lord of the Ring movies because of all the killing. He may change<br/>\nhis mind later. At first when he played Lego Batman, he was saddened and a<br/>\nbit down about the constant loss of lives and killing of criminals, when<br/>\nmany Batman/Superman cartoons he had seen simply lock criminals up and never<br/>\nkill anyone. Then he realized that everyone has infinite lives on that game,<br/>\nand felt better about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was surprised at his reactions and at the same time I wasn&#39;t totally<br/>\nsurprised. Don&#39;t shortchange getting to know your child by preempting things<br/>\nand coaching yourselves and other parents on which kinds of games are<br/>\nappropriate.

Zoombinis doesn&#39;t require much reading, but does develop logical thinking skills as well as being a lot of fun. At various times, the boys have also enjoyed the &quot;Jump Start&quot; series of games for the computer. Along the lines of Zoo Tycoon, there are tons of simulation games. I just picked up one for the boys (but they haven&#39;t tried it yet) about being a vetrinarian.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the Wii, the boys recently discovered Animal Crossing, and they also enjoy the Lego games, the Zelda games, and the sports games that come with the Wii. Animal Crossing is also text intensive, so the younger two boys tend to get more out of it if I sit with them and read what the characters are saying to eachother. There are also Jump Start games available for the Wii, but we haven&#39;t played them yet. There are a lot of movie-themed games for the Wii, which may interest your children, but our experience has been that they often don&#39;t play as well as games that stand on their own merit. (Either they are too easy, or too difficult, or not very interesting.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlong the lines of the Pokemon games (I think - we&#39;re not into Pokemon) are Petz games for the DS, where you can &quot;adopt&quot; various animals and play with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun! <br/>\n<br/>\nCheryl<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Like other said:<br/>\n&gt; the Wii and NIntendo DS systems are great and chuck full of games for girls and <br/>\n&gt; young kids.<br/>\n&gt; I have a 5 year old girl and she loves:<br/>\n&gt; Disney Princesses<br/>\n&gt; KIrby&#39;s Epic Yarn ( this is a fabulous game I highly recomend!!!)<br/>\n&gt; OTher Kirby games<br/>\n&gt; Super Mario Games ( there is one for the DS that is a Princess Peach game!)<br/>\n&gt; My Little Pony for DS ( a very easy game my daughter started playing the DS a <br/>\n&gt; couple years ago with this game)<br/>\n&gt; If they like drawing the Wii has the UDraw now ( I got one for Christmas from my <br/>\n&gt; husband ) and it is cool.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Online there are all the NickJr games<br/>\n&gt; ICanBe Barbie games<br/>\n&gt; ( those are free for the most part)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Alex Polikowsky<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Video Games for the younger set","postDate":"1297185170","msgId":59588,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMwMzNDQ0U3LTJFMTItNEZBQi05NzQ4LUNBQjI2RTE5OENGRUBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlrUXpCeGtCUE5xLU03SDNHU1J4XzI4LUMrQkpybWZfRzU0UFRtbUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGlpcXV1ZSs4Z2g5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8aWlxdmtjK3FiZW5AZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDxBQU5Ma1Rpa1F6QnhrQlBOcS1NN0gzR1NSeF8yOC1DK0JKcm1mX0c1NFBUbW1AbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":59586,"nextInTopic":59590,"prevInTime":59587,"nextInTime":59589,"topicId":59573,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There s a new game for the Wii - Pokepark: Pikachu s Adventure.

It is similar idea to the Wii, but your body is the controller. The Kinect games are $50 each and there are not many titles available. The system also works with regular XBox 360 games, so we have a couple of the Lego ones and a couple that we downloaded (the system has wifi). By far, the family favorite is Plants vs. Zombies*, which is $20.

Most of the games I listed except Zelda are multiplayer and even people who dont play video games much can play them.  The Zelda games are fun to play with kids but it is just one player.  We would just all sit together and take turns with the controller.  One of us would read the text and we would all give input as to where to go.  When my oldest was 4 and 5 we played it alot and he would control untill something scary or stressful to him would happen and he would give the controler to us until it was past.  We also played a Shrek 2 game back then cause it was a mulitplayer 4 person game.  So we would all play together.  Lots of fun.

You can get quite a few<br/>\nnon-violent games on those systems.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Lego series of games (Batman, Star Wars, Harry Potter, Indiana Jones 1<br/>\nand 2, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m forgetting some) aren&#39;t completely non-violent,<br/>\nhowever the characters and enemies are made of lego blocks, and when you hit<br/>\nand or shoot them, the legos simply fall apart and rebuild.  You have<br/>\ninfinite lives so there&#39;s no worry about dying too many times.  There are<br/>\nalso plenty of different goals in each level so it can be played and<br/>\nreplayed for a long time before you truly &quot;beat&quot; the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the Mario games are less violent then most games.   My partner and I<br/>\nlove both the one on the Wii and the one on the DSi.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just recently got Family Game Night 3 for the PS3 (they also have it for<br/>\nWii) and that&#39;s not violent at all, just board games, with some neat twists<br/>\non traditional games.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoving into slightly more violent, but in a &quot;kid-friendly&quot; way there is also<br/>\nthe crash bandicoot series and ratchet and clank (both on Playstation<br/>\nsystems only I believe).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe like Game Stop for used games and systems, however, depending on where<br/>\nyou live you may be able to find an independently owned store that sells<br/>\nolder systems and games.  The Nintendo series of game systems (N64, Game<br/>\nCube) have more non-violent games then the others, but you can find quite a<br/>\nfew for PSOne and PS2 as well.  Game Stop doesn&#39;t carry older systems or<br/>\ngames for them, only the newer ones.  I think they&#39;ve completely ended XBox<br/>\ngames, and they have a small selection of PS2 games, but that is supposed to<br/>\nbe phased out I believe.<br/>\n<br/>\nI second the idea of used games.  We very rarely buy new.  Draven (my 10<br/>\ny/o) beats games rather quickly and doesn&#39;t like to re-play them, so he<br/>\nloves that he can trade games in towards new-to-him used games.  Especially<br/>\nwhile your kids are young I highly recommend looking for games that have<br/>\nbeen out for 6 months to a year, and then buying them.  Games that cost $60<br/>\nnew, tend to go down to $30 used 6 months or so after they come out.<br/>\n However, there have been times that we&#39;ve bought a used version a week or<br/>\nso after the game came out, which is more expensive then waiting, but<br/>\nsometimes he doesn&#39;t want to wait.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, another good one is Little Big Planet 1 and 2, for the PS3 if you go<br/>\nwith that system.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they eventually develop an interest in the violent games then I agree<br/>\nwith the other post about being open to them.  My 10 y/o<br/>\nalmost exclusively plays 1st person shooters now.  I can&#39;t watch most of<br/>\nthem because of the violence, however he has developed a huge interest in<br/>\nvarious periods in history and in the history of weapons in general, just<br/>\nfrom playing those games.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nTina<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, Feb 8, 2011 at 2:04 AM, Kirstin Eventyr &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kiventyr@...\">kiventyr@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My daughters are 5 and 6 and have recently discovered video games<br/>\n&gt; after finding a game in the extras on a DVD we have.

I have a<br/>\npicture of my daughter using her DSi to take a picture of a posed Riolu<br/>\n(Pokemon character plush toy) on a hike we took.  The photos on the DSi can<br/>\nbe edited in a variety of ways, which adds to its appeal.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, even though they&#39;re very easy by now, she still enjoys going to the<br/>\nNick Jr. website online, where you&#39;ll find many games there, too.

Whereas if you let them try games in which they&#39;re interested (renting games before buying is a good option), they will often tell you when a game&#39;s too violent for them. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 12 yr old son plays some games that are violent, but, for the 9 years he&#39;s been gaming, he&#39;s been honest about games he&#39;s tried that are too violent for him or that don&#39;t otherwise interest him.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe now plays games that sometimes have me turning my head away from the screen. If I&#39;d judged a game&#39;s violence acceptability by *my* standards, there&#39;d be games he&#39;d be missing out on, games that he would enjoy because they don&#39;t gross *him* out. (On the flip side, my tolerance for violence in sci-fi and action movies is higher than his. So one person&#39;s tolerance for violence may not be the same from genre to genre.)<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":67727291,"authorName":"wtexans","from":"&quot;wtexans&quot; &lt;wtexans@...&gt;","profile":"wtexans","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Video Games for the younger set","postDate":"1297154508","msgId":59575,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlpcXZrYytxYmVuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlpcXV1ZSs4Z2g5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":59574,"nextInTopic":59576,"prevInTime":59574,"nextInTime":59576,"topicId":59573,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"===I know that GameStop sells preowned games & game systems; I m sure other gaming stores do as well.=== I wanted to add that my son opts for preowned games","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1733914590\">===I know that GameStop sells preowned games & game systems; I&#39;m sure other gaming stores do as well.===<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to add that my son opts for preowned games whenever he can find them, because of the cost savings. We&#39;ve only had a few instances of the preowned games not working, and in those instances the gaming store swapped us another copy of the same game or, if they didn&#39;t have another copy, refunded our money. The gaming store we frequent often has &quot;buy 2, get 1 free&quot; preowned game specials, which is pretty cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nPawn shops often have game systems and games, too. Just be sure to double-check their refund policy in case what you buy doesn&#39;t work or have all the parts (for game systems, there&#39;s usually the system itself + at least one controller + the power cord + the cord that goes from the system to the tv).<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":67727291,"authorName":"wtexans","from":"&quot;wtexans&quot; &lt;wtexans@...&gt;","profile":"wtexans","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Video Games for the younger set","postDate":"1297153806","msgId":59574,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlpcXV1ZSs4Z2g5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGluMlMyaXZvZXREY0doNFpNZUd1ckRCWWpUek9zaUxUZzh6c3pYLUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":59573,"nextInTopic":59575,"prevInTime":59573,"nextInTime":59575,"topicId":59573,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"===My daughters are 5 and 6 and have recently discovered video games after finding a game in the extras on a DVD we have.

My girls do Love Pokemon so anything on par with that would be fine.===<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my opinion, the Wii is the most younger-kid friendly and family friendly of the three main gaming consoles (Wii, Xbox, Playstation 3). There are games (including Pokemon games) that would likely appeal to your kids *and* you. I wasn&#39;t a gamer until my son became interested in gaming at age 3!! His interest in gaming opened up a whole new world of fun for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your budget allows for you to purchase Nintendo DSi&#39;s (or the upcoming Nintendo 3DS, which will support 3-D games), there are a multitude of Pokemon games for that system. With the 3DS coming out, some folks will trade in their DSi&#39;s and use that store credit to apply to the preorder of a 3DS -- which means you can probably get your mitts on preowned DSi&#39;s. Alternatively, you can also find preowned DS Lites (the precursor to the DSi) for a fantastic price. I know that GameStop sells preowned games & game systems; I&#39;m sure other gaming stores do as well. But if you can afford the DSi&#39;s, that has a whole slew of other cool features that the DS Lites don&#39;t (but the price reflects that!).<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":440537707,"authorName":"Kirstin Eventyr","from":"Kirstin Eventyr &lt;kiventyr@...&gt;","profile":"kirventyr","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Video Games for the younger set","postDate":"1297148645","msgId":59573,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGluMlMyaXZvZXREY0doNFpNZUd1ckRCWWpUek9zaUxUZzh6c3pYLUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":59574,"prevInTime":59572,"nextInTime":59574,"topicId":59573,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My daughters are 5 and 6 and have recently discovered video games after finding a game in the extras on a DVD we have.
