Can&#39;t <br/>\nremember if I&#39;ve already sent an intro, so if I have, hi again.  I&#39;m  unschooling <br/>\nmom of three daughters, Katelyn, 21, Jackie, 19, and Cassandra,  14.  <br/>\n <br/>\nKaren - Katelyn unschooled herself from age 15 and was accepted in college  <br/>\nat 17.  We lived in Colorado, which has all sorts of rules about curriculum  <br/>\nand standardized testing, so we enrolled in an awesome umbrella school in Grand  <br/>\nJunction.  (We lived in Denver, a couple hundred miles away.)  It&#39;s  called <br/>\nWest River Academy, and it&#39;s run by Peggy Nishikawa.

Peggy is  fantastic, and has all sorts of <br/>\nknowledge to share.  I don&#39;t know if  she enrolls out-of-state residents, but <br/>\nyou could ask her.  If not, I&#39;m  sure she&#39;d know something about what&#39;s <br/>\navailable in your area.   <br/>\n <br/>\nWe have a local support group based in Flower Mound (just north of DFW  <br/>\nAirport):  DFWSaFE Zone (Dallas/Ft.
