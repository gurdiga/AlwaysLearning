Used to read it lots.  Changed my life.  Also pissed me <br/>\noff.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Are you a Mothering mother?&quot;  Yeah.  Like those who find any fault with that <br/>\nmagazine aren&#39;t mothering their children.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so a &#39;movement&#39; calling itself &quot;taking children seriously&quot; suggests <br/>\npretty clearly that otherwise children aren&#39;t being taken seriously.  And that&#39;s <br/>\nirritating, especially when they won&#39;t even TALK about children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this about my children and my husband and my mother and my dog:  In <br/>\nMY life, they are mine.  In stories about me growing up, I had one mother, one <br/>\nfather.  I can tell stories about them without asking permission because I <br/>\ncan&#39;t tell the story of my life without mentioning them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t be a mother if I had no kids (18 years next Thursday), and so I <br/>\ncan&#39;t talk about being a mother without discussing my children.  They are a part <br/>\nof my life.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people ask me for marital help (and they do, and have for as long as I <br/>\ncan remember), it matters that I&#39;ve been married twice, that Keith and I get <br/>\nalong really well, that we&#39;ve been through some of the same kinds of <br/>\nfrustrations and worked through them.  That matters to the people who are asking me, and <br/>\nit matters to me as an advisor.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20038,"nextTopicId":20024}}
