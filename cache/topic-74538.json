for him, and that would lead him to being spoiled and self-absorbed. &nbsp;He&#39;s eleven now. &nbsp;He&#39;s neither. &nbsp;And, he&#39;s much more patient. &nbsp;:-)<br><br>I gave him lots of options to express his feelings. &nbsp;For him it was sadness. &nbsp;He had big, big expressions of sadness. &nbsp;Some things worked. &nbsp;Some things didn&#39;t. &nbsp;Some things only worked once, then we needed to find something else. &nbsp;He didn&#39;t like me talking a lot while he was in the middle of a big feeling. &nbsp;He still doesn&#39;t. &nbsp;He didn&#39;t like to be touched or reassured. &nbsp;The most important thing was that *I* stay calm. &nbsp;If I was nervous or frustrated or acting frantically, my actions affected his feelings negatively. &nbsp;If I could stay calm and focussed and ready to help, that seemed to have a great effect. &nbsp;If I could not make his feelings about me, that really helped him too.</div><div><br></div><div>I trusted him. &nbsp;I trusted that he was working through something he needed to work through. &nbsp;I trusted that he wasn&#39;t trying to be difficult or get his way or manipulate me. &nbsp;Those were the things I was hearing from family and some friends. &nbsp;I choose to trust Ethan. &nbsp;I believe that people can see when we doubt them, even when we don&#39;t say so aloud. &nbsp;<br><br>I&#39;m going to pull out one thing to show you. &nbsp;You said it starts with:<br><br><span style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);\">&quot;flopping around on the floor complaining&quot;<br><br><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Changing your internal thinking to be focused on seeing what he is really experiencing and looking to find solutions will be a great tool for you. &nbsp;</span>Next time try to see what it really starts with. &nbsp;If you&#39;re thinking &quot;flopping and complaining&quot;, you&#39;re not seeing what he&#39;s really feeling. &nbsp;If you can&#39;t see more clearly what he&#39;s experiencing it will be harder for you to come up with helpful solutions. &nbsp;If I was sad and talking with my husband, I&#39;m sure I would be able to tell if he was thinking I was &quot;crying and complaining&quot; by the way he responded to me. &nbsp;If he was thinking something like &quot;she is really sad and needs my support&quot;, he would respond very differently. &nbsp;I know that&#39;s true for me. &nbsp;I&#39;ve seen the shift in my own actions when I shift my thinking to be more compassionate of the person struggling. &nbsp;Your son will see it too. &nbsp;I&#39;m sure of that.</span></div><div><span style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);\">Karen James. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br></div><div><br></div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Angry 6 year old","postDate":"1405952819","msgId":74543,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":true,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0MDU5NTI4MTkuMTc1NzQuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE4NDkwNS5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDFCOTgwODc0NUFDNTRCOTBBMDM3NkYxQzkzM0NGMTIyQEhhcnJpbWFuPg==","referencesHeader":"PENBTURhX0oxZm1xSFhIVTUyPW01YkQ3WW9ZalRUOG5ZRExSYXdQclFwTnk9K0VNV1h1UUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDFCOTgwODc0NUFDNTRCOTBBMDM3NkYxQzkzM0NGMTIyQEhhcnJpbWFuPg=="},"prevInTopic":74542,"nextInTopic":74544,"prevInTime":74542,"nextInTime":74544,"topicId":74538,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-645515466\"><html><div style=\"color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;\"><div style=\"\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-645515466\"><br style=\"\"><font style=\"\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-645515466\" size=\"4\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;What I don’t understand about unschooling is when you \nrecognise these things (hunger, fatigue etc) the child will not go to bed even \nwhen they’re super pale and tired &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>Maybe the parent need to be more aware before the child gets to the point of being so tired. Maybe you can invite your child, before she is exhausted, to watch some of her favorite shows in a quite room with low light. Maybe the parent can give the child a massage.

There is nothing wrong.<br><br>What the parents needs to do is to keep offering all kinds of food *before* the child is so hungry they are melting down. I try to offer food every 3-4 hours. Bring them snacks. Make monkey platters. When my kids were younger it was every 2-3 hours.<br>I have noticed that when my children reach for a candy because they are hungry I am a little late sometimes and that is the easiest energy source.

It&#39;s human nature. It&#39;s the human drive to make our own choices that can make us want the opposite of what someone is pressuring us to do. It&#39;s the nature of humans who lack experience for emotions to overwhelm logic and the senses.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you&#39;re irritated and people are pushing you to go take a nap, it&#39;s irritating! Someone who feels her choices are her own can usually hear directions as suggestions. Someone who feels pressured by others to do things the &quot;right&quot; way -- e.g., the other person&#39;s way -- will feel suggestions as pressure and will fight against it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen emotion and tiredness overwhelm a child, reason won&#39;t help. Be clever, gentle and understanding. Learn from the meltdown. Learn how to notice signs *before* the meltdown, *before* they&#39;re too tired. <br/>\n<br/>\nSugary snacks are usually easy to grab and eat. And they taste good! :-) Make other foods easy or easier to grab and go. Make monkey platters:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/eating/monkeyplatter\">http://sandradodd.com/eating/monkeyplatter</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t wait until your child is emotional to try to reason. Get there sooner.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** When you know how much better she would feel if she just went to bed earlier  ***<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing certain you know what&#39;s best for another person will get in the way of unschooling. You *might* have the idea that will help, but the certainty and the pressure to do it creates resistance.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe more open to being less certain about one idea. Be more open to there being lots of ideas rather than holding on to *the* one idea you&#39;re sure is right. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut more importantly be more aware so you can help your child before she gets to a stage where she doesn&#39;t want to try anything, she just wants the feeling to go away.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** in practice when there are several children’s needs to consider and try to meet, ***<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman nature doesn&#39;t change just because you have more children than you feel you can always find the energy to be patient and kind to. Don&#39;t expect your child to be understanding that you can&#39;t help her sweetly just because you decided to have 3 other kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nRadical unschooling isn&#39;t about being nice because radically unschooling parents are nice. It&#39;s about understanding human nature and using that understanding to respond to your children&#39;s needs. An only melting down needs as much gentleness and patience as one of four who is melting down.<br/>\n<br/>\nI may be guessing wrong here, but it&#39;s possible that you&#39;re reacting to your kids&#39; feelings and needs with distress. Your kids will feed off your feelings which will make them more distressed. Breathe. The more calm you are, the more you&#39;ll feel like a stable rock in their lives they can hold  on to. The more distressed you are by their distress, the more you&#39;ll feel like a wobbly unstable place to anchor to.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Angry 6 year old","postDate":"1405947905","msgId":74540,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0MDU5NDc5MDUuNTM0Ni5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViMTg0OTA1Lm1haWwuZ3ExLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDE0MDU4ODU4MjMuMzA3NDIuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE4NDkwMS5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PENBTURhX0oxZm1xSFhIVTUyPW01YkQ3WW9ZalRUOG5ZRExSYXdQclFwTnk9K0VNV1h1UUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDE0MDU4ODU4MjMuMzA3NDIuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE4NDkwMS5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":74539,"nextInTopic":74541,"prevInTime":74539,"nextInTime":74541,"topicId":74538,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have heard book The Explosive Child by Green is a very good book for  parents with kids quick to  anger and explosive behaviors and I have seen it","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1208122843\"><html><div style=\"color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;\"><div><span>I have heard book The Explosive Child by Green is a very good book for&nbsp; parents with kids quick to&nbsp; anger and explosive behaviors and I have seen it recommended in this list!<br></span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><font face=\"courier\">Alex Polikowsky</font></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.polykow.blogspot.com/\"></a>&nbsp;</div> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1208122843qtdSeparateBR\"><br><br></div><div style=\"display:block;\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1208122843yahoo_quoted\"> <div style=\"font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;\"> <div style=\"font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;\"> <div dir=\"ltr\"> <font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"> On Sunday, July\n 20, 2014 2:50 PM, &quot;BRIAN POLIKOWSKY polykowholsteins@...

She started to get angry and throw things etc\nas a response to what seemed minor issues.&nbsp; It was very difficult and I\ndidn’t understand what was going on. I googled, I read, I sought help... I\nthought about all those types of tools like wrapping her up tight and chair\nhammocks to swing her though.&nbsp; I never really worked out why this was\nhappening. And her reactions triggered MY reactions and sometimes I felt like\nsuch a lousy mother. </font></div>\n<div><font size=\"4\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font size=\"4\">Sometimes these reactions happen suddenly and, like you say,\nit gets too late to talk and what used to be a relatively uneventful process\n(like Daddy going to work) all of a sudden is a major catastrophe and it hits\nyou for a six. How to know how to prevent it... you can look at hunger and\nfatigue and space. Sometimes it just IS and its deep and its developmental.\n</font></div>\n<div><font size=\"4\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font size=\"4\">What I don’t understand about unschooling is when you\nrecognise these things (hunger, fatigue etc) the child will not go to bed even\nwhen they’re super pale and tired and will not eat sustaining food when\ncomplaining about being hungry and reaches for another sugary thing EVEN when we\ngo about facilitating these things. When you know how much better she would feel\nif she just went to bed earlier (as an adult I feel infinitely better if I go to\nbed before midnight even if I do sleep in the next morning). So sometimes its\neasy to say that you need to look at how to prevent meltdowns and find ways to\nensure a child doesn’t reach breaking point, in practice when there are several\nchildren’s needs to consider and try to meet, its definitely not easy and these\nperfect scenarios are often met with compromise.. and meltdowns results. I have\nfour children. I am literally not able to be in several places at once and\ntherefore to always prevent the meltdown. Its life. </font></div>\n<div><font size=\"4\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font size=\"4\">Anyway, by the time she reached 8 these angry outbursts\nsubsided and now she’s 9 she is able to process her way through her emotions\nmuch better (though still has upsets/frustrations of course – my recent thread \n\nabout pointe shoes is an example -&nbsp; she is able to not go completely \n\noverboard in her angry expressions like she used to).</font></div>\n<div><font size=\"4\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font size=\"4\">There were other factors at that time like my fourth pregnancy\nand a new baby. I was also trying not very successfully to homeschool in a more\ntop down kind of way then. We had very little money to spend on things so I was\nprobably saying no a lot more than I do now.</font></div>\n<div><font size=\"4\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font size=\"4\">Apart from these external factors, which of course are\nentirely unique to everyone and the dynamics that result are unique, I believe\nin <em>general </em>(though certainly not in every child) that 6-7 is a\ntransition stage between early and middle childhood (like the tween years).
