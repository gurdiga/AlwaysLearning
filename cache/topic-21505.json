I struggle to<br/>\nremember  where I know them from if I haven&#39;t seen them often.  I never<br/>\nnotice  what people are wearing or if they gain or lose weight, unless it&#39;s  a<br/>\nsubstantial amount.  Things like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===========<br/>\n <br/>\nMe too.<br/>\nI was asked &quot;what does  he look like?&quot; about my best friend once, and  after <br/>\nI made the description, the other people around me laughed.  It was  <br/>\napparently about five years out of date.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I see a person, I don&#39;t look visually.  I see them as all the  ways they <br/>\nhave ever been since I&#39;ve known them. I see the history and the soul  of <br/>\nthem.  So people I don&#39;t know yet I find very hard to recognize the  second or <br/>\nthird time, until I HAVE them, until I have some depth and perspective  on them.<br/>\n <br/>\nSome people are very visual even if they haven&#39;t seen.   A  homeschool mom <br/>\nI&#39;ve been on a little e-mail loop with for ten years now  described me once <br/>\nbefore she had ever met me.  Every little clue I had ever  given in any <br/>\nconversation over about a year, she had filed into a physical  image.  She was right.  <br/>\nI&#39;m more likely to remember what religion  someone grew up in and where they&#39;ve <br/>\nlived than how tall they are or what color  their hair is.<br/>\n <br/>\nKirby took his long sideburns off.  I didn&#39;t notice, Holly told  me.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo I think some teachers in school assume that others are as visual as they  <br/>\nare.  Some things are easy for visual learners.  Maps, pictures of the  <br/>\nskeletal or circulatory systems.<br/>\n <br/>\nSometimes new homeschoolers want to find their child&#39;s learning style and  <br/>\njust live there, but I think few people are really duds in any one area so it&#39;s  <br/>\nbest to make ALL kinds of information available and let them take it in as <br/>\nthey  will.  Some aural, some visual, some tactile, whatever.<br/>\n <br/>\nOh, and of &quot;aural&quot; and me:  If I hear a name, I often ask for a  spelling. I <br/>\nremember it from picturing it written better than from hearing it  spoken.<br/>\n <br/>\nYears back someone had come across a learning disability (I hope one of you  <br/>\nwill remember or know how to find it, if it wasn&#39;t just a one-time fluke <br/>\nlittle  article) in which the person can ONLY learn through the written word and no <br/>\n other way.  And it had been given some greco/latin scientific name and  <br/>\ncalled a disability.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21504,"nextTopicId":21512}}
