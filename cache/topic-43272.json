Some others<br/>\nbesides me might like it too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s something I read after hitting Sandra&#39;s random button on her Bo<br/>\nelevator which I labeled on my toolbar as RanBO and then I realized it looks<br/>\na lot like the word &quot;rainbow.&quot;  How appropriate.  Anyway, here&#39;s the<br/>\nbeginning snippet:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Someone wrote that they were keeping a little notebook of the questions<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that had arisen, so others on the Unschooling Discussion list started naming<br/>\nquestions of the day. I wrote this:<br/>\n<br/>\nSunday night Holly and I were in the hot tub and she asked me (out of the<br/>\nblue, it seemed) whether people actually really ever put messages in<br/>\nbottles. I said I thought so, and that there are streams and flows in<br/>\noceans, so they might know where they were likely to end up. But I said I<br/>\nthought also people had done it just for fun, like letting a balloon go up<br/>\nwith your name and address fastened to it (she knows a story about that from<br/>\nRipley&#39;s Believe It or Not).<br/>\n<br/>\nTuesday morning, I was looking for a rhyming dictionary link, and found<br/>\nthis: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.poetry.com/timeless/default.asp\">http://www.poetry.com/timeless/default.asp</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not an answer to the question, but it&#39;s a heck of a good coincidence.<br/>\nThey&#39;re selling pretty bottles with poems on pretty paper, mailed to where<br/>\nyou order.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------<br/>\nOther links started to flood in.... &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you like, read the whole very fun page here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/dot/messageinabottle\">http://sandradodd.com/dot/messageinabottle</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo a recent question I&#39;ve collected has a little intro about how it came up:<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple weeks ago (or so ... I don&#39;t remember quite how long it&#39;s been)<br/>\nKarl asked how come the electric piano is messed up.  I said probably<br/>\nlightning got it.  He thought about that for however long it&#39;s been.<br/>\nYesterday he said lightning came into the window and struck the piano (and<br/>\nhe&#39;s five so he&#39;s traced the path from way outside, bringing in some idea<br/>\nabout trees because he saw a youtube video of a tree catching fire after<br/>\nbeing struck).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo his question now is how does lightning really work?  I&#39;ve looked it up<br/>\nand it&#39;s all about the earth&#39;s magnetic fields, another mystery and an<br/>\nabiding interest of Karl&#39;s.  Note to self: compass!  So I&#39;m looking for<br/>\nconnections others might have to add about any of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just love that Karl makes observations which beg still more and more<br/>\nquestion(s) and sometimes they really lead me around looking at this and<br/>\nthat.  Really.  The time I spend on it ... getting lost.  I&#39;m not getting<br/>\nlost.  I *am* lost.  Oh... and there&#39;s no need to send out a search party.<br/>\nI&#39;ll just get lost again in short order.  ;)  I just love that.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43266,"nextTopicId":41400}}
