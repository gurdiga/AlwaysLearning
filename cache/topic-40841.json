Once when I<br/>\nwas 20 and we were traveling together in Ecuador and I got the stomach<br/>\nflu in the middle of the night and was violently shaking all by<br/>\nmyself. My parents were in the room next door and I knocked and asked<br/>\nfor help. My mom held me and helped me warm up and get through the night. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other time was when I was 19 and having a mental breakdown while<br/>\nat college. My roommates had called my folks to tell them I was acting<br/>\nfunny. I was totally out of it and she came up to fly me home and to<br/>\nthe doctor. The night she came to get me she shared my bed with me. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am working hard to have a mature relationship with my mother and<br/>\ntake responsibility for my life and my relationships. But when I think<br/>\nabout those times I have heard her tell that story of us sleeping<br/>\ntogether only in totally emergency situations it breaks my heart.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom has always been proud of the fact that her kids have always<br/>\nbeen very &quot;independent&quot; and she has worked hard to make that so. Now,<br/>\nof four kids, I am the only one that she is somewhat close to. And I<br/>\nlive in Ecuador! Her other children live a lot closer, but resist an<br/>\nintimate relationship with her. Could it be related to her resistance<br/>\nto share intimate space with us when we were younger? I think so.  <br/>\n<br/>\nImagine her dismay when she saw the two double beds pushed together in<br/>\nour house!

Many nights the older kids sleep with us <br/>\non the floor beside our beds. I sleep better when they do. (The only <br/>\nreason we switched it up was that the older ones were expressing a <br/>\ndesire for a place of their own to hang out in and have toys <br/>\nin-assessable from the little ones.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I saw that story about fire alarms on TV, and the parents were <br/>\nshocked that the kids slept through several hours of the alarms, high-<br/>\npitched, going off. I wasn&#39;t surprised at all. I was more surprised <br/>\nthat these parents had formerly depended on the children getting <br/>\nthemselves out of bed when the alarms goes off. I sleep much better at <br/>\nnight when I can hear each person in the room breathing.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a very brief period, when my oldest was just 2, and my son was an <br/>\ninfant, we had put my daughter in her own room.

At that point, I <br/>\nknew she&#39;d probably throw up again, and so we brought her back to our <br/>\nroom so I could hear when it happened to help her, and we never looked <br/>\nback until now. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the only reason they do okay on the nights they sleep away <br/>\nfrom us is that they have each other.

Sharon Abbott mentions a study","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1733621033\">David got the paper about Appalachian co-sleeping practices and it has a wonderful review of the literature on co-sleeping. Sharon Abbott mentions a study about Japanese co-sleeping: &quot;Caudill and Plath&#39;s (1966) well-known study ofJapanese sleeping locations describes their practices throughout the life span, making this an unusual study. They report that the Japanese age of transi- tion away from sleeping with parents is 11, with the process not complete until 15 or 16 years. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe paper is really fascinating. Sharon Abbott is arguing that early family co-sleeping is one of a series of strategies that a parent uses to create a close relationship, an interdependence between parent and child that lasts into adulthood with children continuing to live near their parents. In a paper comparing family characteristics and dynamics in Japan and the U.S. (and so titled) the abstract is this: <br/>\n<br/>\nThis paper uses the Family Environment Scale (FES) to compare and<br/>\ncontrast psychosocial environments of Japanese families with those of<br/>\nAmerican families. The aim is to explore some cultural dynamics of each<br/>\nsociety from the point of view of family behavior. The FES contains 10<br/>\nsubscales, measuring the following family characteristics: Cohesion,<br/>\nExpressiveness, Conflict, Independence, Achievement Orientation,<br/>\nIntellectual-Cultural Orientation, Active-Recreational Orientation,<br/>\nMoral-Religious Emphasis, Organization, and Control. Comparison of each<br/>\nsubscale between Japan and the United States revealed that: (a)<br/>\nCohesion and Control were positively correlated for Japanese parents<br/>\nbut negatively correlated for American parents; (b) Achievement<br/>\nOrientation and Intellectual-Cultural Orientation were positively<br/>\ncorrelated for Japanese parents and uncorrelated for American parents;<br/>\n(c) Cohesion and Control were negatively correlated for American<br/>\nchildren but uncorrelated for Japanese children; and (d) Achievement<br/>\nand Conflict were positively correlated for Japanese children but<br/>\nuncorrelated for American children. Eight of the 10 constructs were<br/>\nuseful for understanding family dynamics in Japan. Independence and<br/>\nExpressiveness, which are important for American families, did not seem<br/>\nto be easily understood concepts for the Japanese. The results and the<br/>\nimplications are discussed in terms of cross-cultural understanding<br/>\nbetween Japan and the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found it looking for Caudill and Plath&#39;s study. I also found a paper (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/153/4/339)\">http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/153/4/339)</a> that said this: <br/>\n<br/>\nThe 2 cultures endow the child as an organism differently. <br/>\nIn Japan, the infant is seen more as a separate biological organismwho from the beginning, in order to develop, needs to be drawninto increasingly interdependent relations with others. In America,the infant is seen more as a dependent biological organism who,in order to develop, needs to be made increasingly independentof others.22(p15)<br/>\nBoth cultures acknowledge that isolating a child at night isstressful but interpret the experience differently. In the UnitedStates, solitary sleep is thought to engender independence inchildren23 and ensure privacy for parents.6 These values supersedethe child&#39;s perceived need. United States values of self-relianceand self-assertion lead mothers to encourage more play withobjects and more attention to the environment than is seen inJapan.24 Night-time counterparts may be found in the use ofpacifiers and transitional objects to encourage infants to fallasleep alone.25The Japanese acknowledge the same developmental struggle withseparation, but, in acceding to the child&#39;s need, emphasizethe value of dependence as the primary socializing experience.The Japanese word for a common cosleeping arrangement demonstratesthis value. &quot;The custom of the child sleeping between the parentsis referred to as kawa. Kawa is the Japanese character for ariver flowing between<br/>\n 2 banks and kawa is therefore used torefer to the child sleeping between the protective support ofthe 2 parents.&quot;26(p138) Other cultures or  subgroups seem tohave a similar emphasis.27-29 Thus, the balance between interdependencyand autonomy is a useful framework in considering cultural differencesin childrearing practices.30-32<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, I don&#39;t know if that helps with anything or gives you more ideas to discuss with your mother-in-law. But I found it an interesting perspective on the outcomes of co-sleeping. When David looked at co-sleeping in the northeast of the UK he found that it correlated heavily with other attachment practices like extended breastfeeding and sling carrying. It makes sense if it is seen as a parental strategy (I&#39;m not arguing that it is a strategy that someone is aware of) for bonding children to parents and to create a more interdependent family structure that those things would be associated. It also makes sense that the bonding that occurs in those first few moments of breastfeeding, producing such a huge oxytocin response and bio feedback loop, would produce all of those correlations as well. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nAnd my<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; sleeping with my kids because I wanted to was a choice, and so<br/>\n&gt; there&#39;s a happiness and a giving there that is missing in both the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;sleep in your own bed&quot; model and the &quot;we all share the bed because<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s the only bed&quot; model.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Something I discovered when I was trying to find articles or links to<br/>\ninformation, was the idea that co-sleeping started to die off because<br/>\npeople could afford bigger houses and more beds, so within that idea it<br/>\nbecomes an issue of &quot;have&quot; and &quot;have not&quot;, when really the issue is<br/>\nprobably more of a biological one.  So the reasoning behind co-sleeping<br/>\nor no co-sleeping has become a confused issue, then throw in the whole<br/>\npsychoanalyst &quot;sex&quot; aspect, and you have an idea that&#39;s been twisted<br/>\ninto something that it&#39;s not.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I could have found the information about co-sleeping in Japanese<br/>\nculture, instead of just references to it.  It seems that part of the<br/>\nidea in Japanese culture is that co-sleeping helps keep everyone<br/>\ncohesive and bound to one another and dependent on one another through<br/>\nfamily, within society at large.  That seems to follow through with some<br/>\nof the sleep studies done in anthropological research as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m reading a book right now that takes place in the Ireland and<br/>\nScotland and they made reference to the fact that all kids co-slept with<br/>\neach other if they weren&#39;t sleeping with their parents, and it was<br/>\nreferencing the 1930&#39;s, so really not that long ago.  It&#39;s fiction,<br/>\nthough, so no references.  The book is &quot;Dream Angus&quot; for anyone<br/>\ninterested, it&#39;s largely about celtic gods and mythology.  It also<br/>\nhappens to be the first chapter book that Margaux has allowed me to read<br/>\nto her.  It isn&#39;t a kid&#39;s book though.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read several things also referencing European cultures, in general<br/>\nco-sleep, at least with babies and young children, and that is way more<br/>\ncommon than in the US.  I can&#39;t tell you wether this is true or not,<br/>\njust anecdotal, from stuff I was reading.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

The relationship is <br/>\nmore important to me than the control of being right, etc.  She <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t agree with many of our choices, but she does support us <br/>\nrespectfully.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Frankly, some of our best discussions and communication is done in <br/>\nthe bed late<br/>\nat night--all of us in the dark (somewhat) and the kids really <br/>\nconnect with us<br/>\nand with each other in ways that maybe the light of day inhibits. <br/>\nThese<br/>\nmemories, this comfort, I am sure, will be the things we all hold on <br/>\ntight to<br/>\nthroughout our lives.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYES, YES, YES.  Tails has her `day persona&#39; (strong, independent, <br/>\nself-assured).  At night, I get her `night persona&#39; (little girl, <br/>\nneeds her Mama, has many questions, big emotions).  If I told Tails <br/>\nto `get in your room and go to bed&#39; I would NEVER have the <br/>\nopportunity to share this special part of her.  Hmmmm, I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\neven know it exists.

She&#39;s still afraid<br/>\nof the dark, and for whatever reason (people are different), I&#39;m not spooked<br/>\nby it.  Karl is definitely afraid of the dark but getting less so as time<br/>\ngoes by and I give him ideas for how to deal with it and go with him<br/>\nwhenever he wants me to.

It&#39;s the autobiography of a Dobe !Kung woman as framed within the narration that Marjorie Shostak gives it. I don&#39;t know why the text from that book stuck with me, but there are passages in the book where Nisa talks about becoming aware of her parents having sex while she coslept. There is a passage in the beginning of a chapter called Discovering Sex that describes the sleeping arrangements (without reference to age, the !Kung don&#39;t have any calendar, usually the aging of individuals comes from using the data that the Herero, their neighbors kept of who was born when who the !Kung knew to be roughly the same age. &quot;Parents and children sleep together, sharing their blankets, in small one-room huts that have no dividers or private sections.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nMeredith Small has this to say in the book Our Babies, Ourselves  (oh, a quick search gave me a similar piece from an article she wrote here:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mothering.com/articles/new_baby/sleep/small.html)\">http://www.mothering.com/articles/new_baby/sleep/small.html)</a>:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Appalachia or eastern Kentucy, co-sleeping in infancy and childhood is the norm, as it has been for hundreds of years &lt;there is a citation to a paper that I&#39;d like to access&gt;. Although the people of this area are not an &quot;ethnic minority&quot; or recent immigrants, they do represent a chesive population that has been resistant to change. Historians note that in colonial times on the eastern seaboard in the United States, several people slept in the same bed--it was the only way to sleep in such small houses (cit. Tobacco Colony: Life in Early Maryland 1650-1720. G. Main). But when new ideas about privacy began to appear in the nineteenth centruy, housing reflected thos changes and suddenly there were private sleeping rooms, first in public houses and then in private homes. The people of Appalachia, descendants of that more colonial tradition, continued the communal sleeping arrangement and even now refuse to place babies alone even when there is plenty of<br/>\n room. Contrary to the advice given by pediatricians in the area, these mothers place their babies in the parental bed because they believe in their particular parenting ideology. As anthropologist Susan Abbott points out, &quot;What it [co-sleeping] is not is some kind of quaint holdover from an archaic past, nor is it pathological in its constitution or outcome for the majority of those who experience it. It is a current, well-situated pattern of child rearing that is withstanding the onslaught of advice by contemporary childcare experts.&quot; The point is to make a tightly knit family and keep children close. Seventy-five-year-old Verna Mae Sloane writes of motherhood in Appalachia: &quot;How can you expect to hold on to them in life if you begin by pushing them away?&quot; (cit. Common Folks, Sloane, V.M., 1978) Again, the ideology guiding co-sleeping in such cultures is one of attachment rather than independence. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, here&#39;s a nice little piece: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nd.edu/~jmckenn1/lab/longterm.html,\">http://www.nd.edu/~jmckenn1/lab/longterm.html,</a> a couple of snippets: <br/>\n<br/>\nIn a survey of adult college age subjects, Lewis<br/>\nand Janda (2) report that males who coslept with their parents between<br/>\nbirth and five years of age had significantly higher self-esteem,<br/>\nexperienced less guilt and anxiety, and reported greater frequency of<br/>\nsex. Boys who coslept between 6 and 11 years of age also had higher<br/>\nself-esteem. For women, cosleeping during childhood was associated with<br/>\nless discomfort about physical contact and affection as adults. (While<br/>\nthese traits may be confounded by parental attitudes, such findings are<br/>\nclearly inconsistent with the folk belief that cosleeping has<br/>\ndetrimental long-term effects on psycho-social development.<br/>\n<br/>\n* A study of parents of 86<br/>\nchildren in clinics of pediatrics and child psychiatry (ages 2-13<br/>\nyears) on military bases (offspring of military personnel) revealed<br/>\nthat cosleeping children received higher evaluations of their<br/>\ncomportment from their teachers than did solitary sleeping children,<br/>\nand they were underrepresented in psychiatric populations compared with<br/>\nchildren who did not cosleep. The authors state: &quot;Contrary to<br/>\nexpectations, those children who had not had previous professional<br/>\nattention for emotional or behavioral problems coslept more frequently<br/>\nthan did children who were known to have had psychiatric intervention,<br/>\nand lower parental ratings of adaptive functioning. The same finding<br/>\noccurred in a sample of boys one might consider &quot;Oedipal victors&quot; (e.g.<br/>\n3 year old and older boys who sleep with their mothers in the absence<br/>\nof their fathers)--a finding which directly opposes traditional<br/>\nanalytic thought&quot; (4). <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: sorschasmom &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:willowsfortress@...\">willowsfortress@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Monday, 8 December, 2008 3:25:09 AM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Need &#39;supporting&#39; links, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Mil (who is really cool and we get along beautifully) just came <br/>\nfor a visit.
