I wanted to apologize because I&#39;m about to be away from home  <br/>\nfor eight days (conference in Minnesota and visiting with Kelli  <br/>\nTraaseth&#39;s family), and there are things I had on my list to do that  <br/>\nwon&#39;t be finished.   I have some good comments from Betsy to add to  <br/>\nthe unschooling panel responses that followed on the HSC conference.   <br/>\nI meant to send some wolf stuff to a little girl; that will happen  <br/>\nbut not so soon.  For the connections stuff, I mean to add some pages  <br/>\nto my website (and thanks for the photos I was sent yesterday).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the webpages are finished, sometime in October I hope, they&#39;ll  <br/>\nbe announced two places:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com/\">http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nand<br/>\n<br/>\non an e-mail list which can be subscribed to (for those who prefer e- <br/>\nmail to blogs) by sending an e-mail to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd-subscribe@yahoogroups.com\">SandraDodd-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nor going to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sandradodd/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sandradodd/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone has a good connections story to share, or a blogpost I  <br/>\nmight link to when I get that going, please let me know.  For now,  <br/>\nthere are some older things already online at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/\">http://sandradodd.com/</a> <br/>\nconnections (halfway down that page other peoples stories are).<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30828,"nextTopicId":30872}}
