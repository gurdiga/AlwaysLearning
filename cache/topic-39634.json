I like cracking the eggs  <br/>\ninto a bowl.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat whole quote was beautiful, but I wanted to say that this reminds  <br/>\nme of how I feel most of the time about my dishes.  I like my dishes,  <br/>\nso I LIKE to wash them and put them back in their own little patterns  <br/>\nand piles, and then I like to use them again and to put food in or on  <br/>\njust the right one.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of my dishes are from thrift stores.  A few were gifts, some are  <br/>\n&quot;SCA dishes&quot; (blown glass or pottery that can be used for  <br/>\nmedievalesque purposes), a few are things the kids and I did when  <br/>\nthey were little at paint your own pottery places.  When something  <br/>\nhas a negative memory or is irritating, I either give it away or  <br/>\nstuff it up or back where it&#39;s not in daily rotation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThinking of a &quot;&#39;Goodnight Moon&#39; world,&quot; as he said, that world  <br/>\n(though contained) still had the moon and animals and things that  <br/>\naren&#39;t usually inside.  So that reminds me of patterns within  <br/>\npatterns, which goes back to the show about fractals.  If Kenny  <br/>\nShopsin is commending a life of accepting and appreciating what is at  <br/>\nhand, then a pattern within that is appreciating the swirls in the  <br/>\npan when scrambled eggs are cooking.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling can ideally be about rearranging the interesting little  <br/>\nthings you already have in your life, in your house, in your mind-- <br/>\nsharing ideas, and songs, and clothes, and food.  Puzzles.  Movies.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou quoted Kenny Shopsin:  &quot;I cook about ninety dozen eggs every  <br/>\nSaturday and every Sunday...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s a professional, so that&#39;s a business expense, the 90 dozen  <br/>\neggs.  But it reminds me of unschoolers who keep a wall of &quot;we can&#39;t  <br/>\ndo it, we can&#39;t afford it, that costs money&quot; between them and  <br/>\nenriching their lives, when they might just need to see things  <br/>\ndifferently (including how money should be spent) or get over the  <br/>\nidea that educational materials come from &quot;Gifts for the Gifted&quot;  <br/>\nkinds of catalogs, and not from yard sales or dumpsters.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo two videos for those who want some visuals.

He&#39;s a cook in New York who just co-authored a cookbook/autobiography called Eat Me the Food and Philosophy of Kenny Shopsin. The food is fantastic, David fixed the most wonderful corn chowder last night. And the mac and cheese pancakes are amazing. He&#39;s written a couple of things that feel like the same thing as being easily amused. And I keep thinking about his words: <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI often compare my ideas about cooking to the children&#39;s book Goodnight Moon, by Margaret Wise Brown, where the little boy discoveres that everything he needs in life is in his life already, right in his own room. In a Goodnight Moon  world, it&#39;s pretty easy to be a good home cook. It&#39;s really not about having some terrific skills or exotic ingredients or expensive high_tech equipment. It&#39;s not even about having the right secret recipe. To be a good cook, to turn out good, honest food that satisfies your individual tastes, it is all about having the kind of confidence ans self-awareness that comes from Goodnight Moon living, in which you are happy with what is already in your life. <br/>\nand<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI cook about ninety dozen eggs every Saturday and every Sunday, and I enjoy cooking them each time I do it. I like cracking the eggs into a bowl. I like breaking the yolks and whisking them with cream for scrambled eggs. I like watching the ripples form as they cook, and I like the process of gently running my fork through cooked eggs to create space for the raw egg to hit the pan. When I&#39;m making fried eggs and sunnies, I like heating the butter in the pan; I like sliding the eggs in to the butter; and I like sliding the finished eggs from the pan onto a plate. I like everything there is about making eggs, and no matter how many times I do it, I still like doing it. There&#39;s nothing else I&#39;d rather be doing. I don&#39;t come to the task from a place of drudgery or boredom. I come to it from a place of curiosity and love. To be a good cook you have to. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe those kinds of ideas, the being happy with what you already have in your life opens up access to being easily engaged and amused. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.waynforth.blogspot.com\">http://www.waynforth.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Bath Bombs (was Re: Is this common?","postDate":"1225276534","msgId":39706,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFGNTI4NDE0LTUyM0EtNEJCQy04ODU3LThDODI4ODIyQzVCMkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdlOGRsdSs2MmswQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdlOGRsdSs2MmswQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39704,"nextInTopic":39707,"prevInTime":39705,"nextInTime":39707,"topicId":39634,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I know an unschooler who has a an online soap store: http://www.wildlyluckysoap.com/bath_bomb.htm She has bath bombs!-=- Thanks, Flo!

He used to golf with DH but quit when he thought he wasn&#39;t <br/>\n&lt;as good as he should be. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTara, you need to give him more time. It is possible it&#39;s something <br/>\nto do with school, whereby he thinks nothing he does is good enough. <br/>\nMy son was feeling this way when we first took him out of school. He <br/>\nwould only do things that he knows he will be able to ace it. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;He refuses to touch anything art related because he &quot;sucks at art&quot; <br/>\n&lt;(but will have fun if it&#39;s a project without a preconceived <br/>\n&lt;outcome).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son hates Maths, art and writing and the whole lot. He hates art <br/>\nbecause he doesn&#39;t like the feeling of glue on his fingers. He hates <br/>\npainting because it&#39;s a &quot;girl thing&quot;. But he&#39;ll cut and cellotape <br/>\nand draw and colour with marker pen and make things (it&#39;s NOT art, <br/>\nso he claims).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son hates anything that&#39;s got a timer on it, still do. He hates <br/>\ngames with timer on it. He still thinks that he&#39;ll fail if he is <br/>\nbeing time on anything. This is definetely to do with his thinking <br/>\nof &quot;in-ability to match up to the expectation&quot;. Which is why I do <br/>\nnot place any expectation upon him. <br/>\n<br/>\nI praise by sharing his happiness and sense of achievement with him <br/>\non whatever good work he feels worthy enough to share with us. A <br/>\ntreat or a smother him with kisses session of which he can actually <br/>\ntell me &quot;Stop!! it is only a SMALL thing that didn&#39;t warrant so many <br/>\nsloberring kisses !! <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the beginning, I spend alot of time sitting next to him, being <br/>\ninvolve with his daily activities, which is often open-ended. And <br/>\nwe&#39;re cool with it because it just seems like with DS&#39;s nature to <br/>\nhave  ongoing and never-ending projects. To him, it is, but of <br/>\ncourse to us parents, we can see how it metamorphed from one mini <br/>\nproject to another. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy me spending lots of time next to him, it&#39;s helping to give him <br/>\nthe message that I am enjoying whatever he is doing so much, that I <br/>\nam happy to let him lead us into any activities. &quot;Little sense of <br/>\nachivements building up into mountains &quot; i used to tell hubby.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNowadays, he&#39;s quite happy plodding along on his own. <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; The other day he didn&#39;t want to go to the Ren Faire but since it <br/>\nwas the last minute he reluctantly went anyway. Once there he had a <br/>\n&gt; blast. It&#39;s like when he&#39;s out and about he&#39;s more open to new <br/>\n&gt; experiences but once at home he feels caccooned in his environment <br/>\n&gt; and closes up. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kid used to have pre-concieved idea to any events, that he&#39;ll not <br/>\nenjoy himself, but once there, can have a fabulous time. But he can <br/>\nactually convinced himself into a twist, that he&#39;ll have a horirble <br/>\ntime and still insist on going home when we arrive. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I always gives him an option. That we&#39;ll go and check it out, and <br/>\nshould he still thinks he&#39;ll not want to stay for the party or <br/>\nevent, then it&#39;s fine, we&#39;ll leave immediately. I alway tells him <br/>\nthat everybody is entitled to feeling horrible for the day. And <br/>\nnobody has to do what they don&#39;t want to.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOver time he has learned that sometimes even tho his brain &quot;plays <br/>\ntrick on him by making him not want to go&quot;, he can actually change <br/>\nhis mind and decide to stay on for some fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nTara, my kid&#39;s diagnosed as asperger, even tho alot of his <br/>\nlimitation is no longer in existing or relevant in our happy and <br/>\ncarefree unschooling life. But what I&#39;ve mentioned above, was and <br/>\nstill is my support towards his emotional issues, asperger or not. <br/>\nIt ws just naturally him.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kid is a perfectionist, and need constant help to make him <br/>\nunderstand that &quot;it&#39;s ok to make mistake&quot;, and that we&#39;re human, and <br/>\nall human makes mistakes. Now that we&#39;re unschooling, we had all the <br/>\ntime, freedom and space to help him understand that he is allowed to <br/>\nmake all the mistakes without being label as stupid or incompetent.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe understands now that making mistake is not a crime, and it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean he is &quot;not good enough&quot;. It&#39;s natural, and is what <br/>\nhelps makes him a cleverer boy, day by day. I told him the story of <br/>\nThomas Edison. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s coming to nearly 2 years of unschooling now, we&#39;re still having <br/>\nalot of inpromtu discussion about all his previous heartaches and <br/>\ntroubles in school. It&#39;s just him needing to make sense of it. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe still goes back into his comfort zone of predictability and <br/>\nfamiliarity,  when the going gets too much, especially if he has <br/>\nextend himself into something new like friends and homeschooling <br/>\ngroups.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Tara, my advice will be just accept him for what he is. All kids <br/>\nwill eventually find the right balance and the right medium for <br/>\nthier own development. And most of the time, it is not something <br/>\nwe&#39;ll recognised. Perhaps, he is already blossoming in his mind now, <br/>\nand is yet to manifest it physically, which is why you do not <br/>\nrecognised it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps<br/>\n<br/>\nBest Wishes<br/>\nSharonBugs </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Is this common?","postDate":"1225193105","msgId":39669,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBFMzcyMjNFLTUxRjQtNEUwQi1BNTNDLUU0REVDMEEwMTAzMUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdlMzhqMCs2YWhyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdlMzhqMCs2YWhyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39668,"nextInTopic":39670,"prevInTime":39668,"nextInTime":39670,"topicId":39634,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It just seems to me, his interest is deep and long and <br/>\nalways &quot;on-going&quot;. Even tho he might have stop doing something, say <br/>\nstop playing the Lego star wars game, it doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s finsihed <br/>\nwith it. On contrary, he is just taking a break from it, recharge by <br/>\nplaying with something else, then get back to it eventually.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, it is common to see him amusing hismefl with the same old toys <br/>\nor games on a regular basis. It&#39;s his way of making sense of that <br/>\ntoy or testing out that idea he&#39;s got in his mind. He&#39;s playing, and <br/>\nthat&#39;s what is most important. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;ll say to you, when he&#39;s had enough, he&#39;ll be ready for new <br/>\nthings. Till then, he&#39;ll just be as happy and content and <br/>\ncomfortable with what he has and wants to do. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is 8, and even tho is open to trying alot of different <br/>\nactivities, is still not keen to pick up any new activities, and is <br/>\nvery much happy and stuck with what he&#39;s is doing. Which is playing <br/>\nwith his Lego, ps2, psp, watching tv, and burning stuff.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kid will always never fails to want something when we&#39;re in the <br/>\nmall or library. Well, afterall, when we&#39;re in the mall, he sees me <br/>\nbuying stuff (even tho it&#39;s household stuff LOL!), so he&#39;s only <br/>\nmirroring what I am doing. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I make it the point to take him window shopping too, allowing <br/>\nhim to touch and play to his heart&#39;s content, and SHOULD a toy <br/>\nreally sticks with him (this means he is definetely sure about that <br/>\ntoy), he&#39;s allowed to buy it with his pocket money. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he hasn&#39;t got enough, and if the toy is nothing more than a <br/>\nfiver, I&#39;ll either top it up or I&#39;ll buy it for him. Anything more <br/>\nthan that will require us to &quot;save up for it&quot; which means we&#39;ll be <br/>\nable to get it next week. So he&#39;ll have to pick a cheaper option or <br/>\nwait for it next week.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut there are times I&#39;m aware he&#39;s tired, he&#39;s confused and he is <br/>\nwhiny, and need to buy something, just for the sake of buying <br/>\nsomething- an immediate &quot;happy fix&quot;. Well he need a fix, what can I <br/>\nsay. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo if he cannot make up his mind, I&#39;ll suggest a few options and <br/>\nshops to visit, which is usually somewhere nice and cheap, like a <br/>\nbookshop for a book, or newsstand for a magazine that he&#39;ll read <br/>\nsomeday, or something that will come handy to him later on - like <br/>\nadditional tracks to add onto his model train set. But it is always <br/>\nwith a fixed budget of nothing more than GBP3. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have gone into Lush to buy him a bathbomb for his bath later, and <br/>\nhe had a lovely and happy time touching and sniffing evry thing in <br/>\nthat shop. We have also bought something for someone else instead, <br/>\nlike he bought a little toy for his little cousin, happy knowing <br/>\nthat she&#39;ll be happy receiving it (despite the fact that we won&#39;t be <br/>\nseeing her soon,  not in the next 9 months LOL!) <br/>\n<br/>\nI have suggested driving by the library to rent a movie or a game <br/>\ndisc which is cheaper. Sometimes he sometimes think is a great idea, <br/>\nand gets him happy again, just deciding which movie or game to get.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo maybe the next time your kid needs &quot;a happy fix&quot; by buy <br/>\nsomething, perhaps you can help him by suggesting more options.   <br/>\n<br/>\nBest Wishes<br/>\nSharonBugs</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Is this common?","postDate":"1225148544","msgId":39662,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxQUNFNzA5LTUxRDYtNDRCMi04N0VELTMwNkVENzZEMzlBMEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdlNThyZytzNnI0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdlNThyZytzNnI0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39661,"nextInTopic":39668,"prevInTime":39661,"nextInTime":39663,"topicId":39634,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I had another couple of shopping-related thoughts.

I don&#39;t think<br/>\nit is unreasonable to say &quot;let&#39;s sleep on that purchase&quot;. Money is<br/>\ntight at our house but I&#39;m frugal by choice as well. My 8yo can go to<br/>\nthe library and check out an entire section if she chooses. If things<br/>\naren&#39;t so interesting once she&#39;s home, so what? Sometimes the &quot;cover&quot;<br/>\nis more interesting than the concept, and often we get caught up in<br/>\nthe moment. But if I&#39;m paying for it, and she has a habit of wanting<br/>\nthings that are new and (seemingly) exciting, then I would table it:<br/>\nmaybe just as long as it takes to run another errand. I suggest trying<br/>\nthe tactic of putting some time and space between a desire and a<br/>\npossible acquisition.<br/>\n<br/>\nCase in point: my daughters loved the science experiments we did a few<br/>\nmonths ago (making a volcano, blowing up a ziplock bag with baking<br/>\nsoda and vinegar, making pepper dance, etc.). We liked it so much that<br/>\nI went to the library and grabbed tons of books on science experiments<br/>\nyou can do at home. Well, September came around and my 8 yo joined<br/>\ncheerleading, art classes resumed, she started musical theatre dance<br/>\nand violin. We have not resumed our reading of the Narnia series and<br/>\nwe&#39;re both OK with that. We&#39;ve found other interests. The twins are<br/>\ntaking a formal biology course now, complete with labs, so they are<br/>\nnot interested in our &quot;homey&quot; science experiments. We haven&#39;t done a<br/>\nscience experiment since August.<br/>\n<br/>\nI struggle with the delicate balance of guiding and infringing. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t necessarily think that because your son drops a game after the<br/>\nthrill of receiving it has past that it&#39;s your clue to pick up the<br/>\nactivity (unless it&#39;s an activity that you want to pick up and YOU are<br/>\ninterested in). However, if your son drops his new interests then<br/>\nclaims he&#39;s bored, maybe that is a call for assistance and that would<br/>\nbe a great time to bring out a new game, book, or conduct an at-home<br/>\nscience experiment. -<br/>\n<br/>\nAfrica<br/>\n<br/>\n-- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Pamela Sorooshian<br/>\n&lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Strewing the stuff the kids themselves originally chose but are  <br/>\n&gt; forgetting about, as opposed to strewing things the parents think  <br/>\n&gt; might be cool.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It is the parental ability to keep track of stuff that I&#39;m talking  <br/>\n&gt; about, though.

In that case, sometimes spending  <br/>\n&gt; more time at 99 cent stores and thrift stores and garage sales is  <br/>\n&gt; worthwhile, but also it might be fun for the child to be on the  <br/>\n&gt; selling side - HAVE a garage sale yourselves (or a lemonade stand or  <br/>\n&gt; bake sale or ???).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And to see the bigger principle in this situation - I&#39;ve noticed that  <br/>\n&gt; whenever my kids are doing something that is irritating or concerning  <br/>\n&gt; me, it is very very often that I&#39;m not picking up signals about their  <br/>\n&gt; interests. Usually it is because their behavior hooked into something  <br/>\n&gt; that I don&#39;t like about myself or about someone in my past, so I  <br/>\n&gt; stopped paying attention to what the behavior really means in my own  <br/>\n&gt; child. Perfect example would be a kid who always wants to buy lots of  <br/>\n&gt; stuff in stores. What does that mean? What need does the child really  <br/>\n&gt; have? How can we pursue this interest? If I&#39;m not asking myself those  <br/>\n&gt; questions, but, instead, I&#39;m worrying that my child is turning out to  <br/>\n&gt; be careless with money, materialistic, wasteful, selfish, etc., then  <br/>\n&gt; THAT shows that I, myself, have issues that are being poked and  <br/>\n&gt; disturbed by my child&#39;s behavior - behavior that probably has nothing  <br/>\n&gt; at all to do with greed or materialism or manipulation by Madison  <br/>\n&gt; Avenue or whatever/however I&#39;m thinking of it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There does seem to be a human urge to trade (buy and sell) - to give  <br/>\n&gt; something in order to get something - and to end up better off after  <br/>\n&gt; the trade. Pokemon and other trading card games are an example of kids  <br/>\n&gt; getting really into this. There is a game we&#39;ve played at big Girl  <br/>\n&gt; Scout campouts (not official, something the girls came up with to do  <br/>\n&gt; in their nonscheduled time). It is called &quot;Bigger or Better.&quot; Girls  <br/>\n&gt; from one troop or group will find something around their campsite to  <br/>\n&gt; trade. It might be a pinecone or a marble or a pretty leaf or a stick  <br/>\n&gt; of gum - anything. They go around to other campsites and ask, &quot;Bigger  <br/>\n&gt; or Better?&quot; The girls at that site make offers of things to trade for  <br/>\n&gt; the original item - the original girls keep looking until they get an  <br/>\n&gt; offer they accept - then both groups keep going and going. It often  <br/>\n&gt; ends up, at campouts, with a group getting some kind of special food  <br/>\n&gt; goodie, some specialty treat made over a campfire or something. When  <br/>\n&gt; you eat what you traded for - that pretty much ends that round &lt;G&gt;.  <br/>\n&gt; They have a blast doing this and it can go on for the entire 2 or 3  <br/>\n&gt; days of camping. And the things they are trading? Usually a pretty  <br/>\n&gt; leaf or a piece of string - never anything &quot;valuable&quot; at all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -pam<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Oct 27, 2008, at 8:04 AM, Sandra Dodd wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -=-This should probably go on the job description for unschooling<br/>\n&gt; &gt; parents.

Say Rosie buys a book and it gets put on the bookshelf  <br/>\nand forgotten (by her). I could be irritated that she bought a book  <br/>\nthat she never even bothered to read, or I could remember that book is  <br/>\nthere and pull it out for her when the time seems right (not when  <br/>\nshe&#39;s already involved in watching tv or playing a game, but when I  <br/>\nsense that she&#39;d appreciate a good book. Or I might &#39;strew&#39; it in the  <br/>\n&quot;leave it around&quot; sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wanted to add that it could be the act of buying stuff that is  <br/>\ninteresting, not the stuff itself. In that case, sometimes spending  <br/>\nmore time at 99 cent stores and thrift stores and garage sales is  <br/>\nworthwhile, but also it might be fun for the child to be on the  <br/>\nselling side - HAVE a garage sale yourselves (or a lemonade stand or  <br/>\nbake sale or ???).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to see the bigger principle in this situation - I&#39;ve noticed that  <br/>\nwhenever my kids are doing something that is irritating or concerning  <br/>\nme, it is very very often that I&#39;m not picking up signals about their  <br/>\ninterests. Usually it is because their behavior hooked into something  <br/>\nthat I don&#39;t like about myself or about someone in my past, so I  <br/>\nstopped paying attention to what the behavior really means in my own  <br/>\nchild. Perfect example would be a kid who always wants to buy lots of  <br/>\nstuff in stores. What does that mean? What need does the child really  <br/>\nhave? How can we pursue this interest? If I&#39;m not asking myself those  <br/>\nquestions, but, instead, I&#39;m worrying that my child is turning out to  <br/>\nbe careless with money, materialistic, wasteful, selfish, etc., then  <br/>\nTHAT shows that I, myself, have issues that are being poked and  <br/>\ndisturbed by my child&#39;s behavior - behavior that probably has nothing  <br/>\nat all to do with greed or materialism or manipulation by Madison  <br/>\nAvenue or whatever/however I&#39;m thinking of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere does seem to be a human urge to trade (buy and sell) - to give  <br/>\nsomething in order to get something - and to end up better off after  <br/>\nthe trade. Pokemon and other trading card games are an example of kids  <br/>\ngetting really into this. There is a game we&#39;ve played at big Girl  <br/>\nScout campouts (not official, something the girls came up with to do  <br/>\nin their nonscheduled time). It is called &quot;Bigger or Better.&quot; Girls  <br/>\nfrom one troop or group will find something around their campsite to  <br/>\ntrade. It might be a pinecone or a marble or a pretty leaf or a stick  <br/>\nof gum - anything. They go around to other campsites and ask, &quot;Bigger  <br/>\nor Better?&quot; The girls at that site make offers of things to trade for  <br/>\nthe original item - the original girls keep looking until they get an  <br/>\noffer they accept - then both groups keep going and going. It often  <br/>\nends up, at campouts, with a group getting some kind of special food  <br/>\ngoodie, some specialty treat made over a campfire or something. When  <br/>\nyou eat what you traded for - that pretty much ends that round &lt;G&gt;.  <br/>\nThey have a blast doing this and it can go on for the entire 2 or 3  <br/>\ndays of camping. And the things they are trading? Usually a pretty  <br/>\nleaf or a piece of string - never anything &quot;valuable&quot; at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Oct 27, 2008, at 8:04 AM, Sandra Dodd wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; -=-This should probably go on the job description for unschooling<br/>\n&gt; parents.
