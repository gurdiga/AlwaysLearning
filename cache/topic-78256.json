There is someone else I saw in passing trying to present unschooling to Black families in some particular way that would suggest some kids learn differently than others.<br/>\n<br/>\nALL kids learn the same way—regardless of politics or race or intellectual particulars.  There is not one kind of unschooling for “gifted” and one for slow.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlind or deaf kids ARE likely to need some expert help to get tools, but then they can learn by exploring the world  in ways that interest them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway… I care about what helps natural learning, and if someone’s politics get between them and seeing or caring about natural learning, unschooling isn’t going to work for them, NOT because they are different or their kids are exceptions, but because they’re not looking at or for unschooling.  They’re grandstanding about something different.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":231415297,"authorName":"chris ester","from":"chris ester &lt;chris.homeschool@...&gt;","profile":"chris_e_bear","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Giving up, maybe","postDate":"1504728758","msgId":78265,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBTXVqbWR0ZnBlU0Y0YTgtczhBQlBSQWU2cGlzc1VSeTY5WWFkZDJmUkVVWUZkZC0yd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENENEE1NjlFLTExN0YtNEVERS1BN0IzLTRGOTFDMDcxMURFRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENENEE1NjlFLTExN0YtNEVERS1BN0IzLTRGOTFDMDcxMURFRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":78264,"nextInTopic":78266,"prevInTime":78264,"nextInTime":78266,"topicId":78256,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My kids used to joke that some people thought that they were unschooling because they let their kids choose which curriculum to work on first....
