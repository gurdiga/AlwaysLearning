I&#39;ve been trying my best to provide an environment in which she can recover from her 6 years of public schooling. I won&#39;t go into details, but I think we are on the right path for us and we have been enjoying a peaceful and fun few months. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, however I&#39;m facing the dreaded Public School system homeschool evaluation for the first time. Looking at the form which tells me what they expect me to present to them when I come in for evaluation in January, I am getting rather nervous since I have very few samples of her writing and math to show them and no testing or written evaluations. It&#39;s pretty clear and no surprise to me that they expect me to produce evidence of &quot;school at home.&quot; But I have hardly anything that looks like school to show them. I knew this was coming -it&#39;s been on the back of my mind, but I&#39;ve been concentrating on allowing my child (and myself) to deschool and on thinking and reading about unschooling and what may be the best way to encourage her interests and abilities, not on producing a portfolio of busy work to show a school official.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI imagine this is a rather common concern with unschoolers - especially newbies.  Any suggestions, advice, links to go to for preparing for this evaluation and getting through it with &quot;a passing grade?&quot; I don&#39;t want to stop unschooling and start asking my daughter to do busy work just to pad a portfolio for them  . . . but I am tempted just out of the fear that they won&#39;t let me continue. How do I avoid that and yet give them what they want so they won&#39;t get in my way? I might be able to get through it this time with a slap on the wrist if I don&#39;t have enough stuff to show, but what about next time? Am I anticipating trouble that I probably won&#39;t encounter?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48982,"nextTopicId":49012}}
