She has  worked carefully and <br/>\nsteadily to perfect her internal image of God.  But  some other Christians would <br/>\nsay she doesn&#39;t know God at ALL.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m going to quote a 19th century poem that came up elsewhere  <br/>\n(unschooling.com a week or so ago), so it&#39;s fresh in my mind:<br/>\n <br/>\nIt was six men of Indostan  <br/>\nTo learning much inclined,  <br/>\nWho went to see the Elephant  <br/>\n(Though all of them were blind),  <br/>\nThat each by observation  <br/>\nMight satisfy his mind <br/>\n<br/>\nThe First approached the Elephant,  <br/>\nAnd happening to fall  <br/>\nAgainst his broad and sturdy side,  <br/>\nAt once began to bawl:  <br/>\n“God bless me! but the Elephant  <br/>\nIs very like a wall!” <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Second, feeling of the tusk,  <br/>\nCried, “Ho! what have we here  <br/>\nSo very round and smooth and sharp?  <br/>\nTo me ’tis mighty clear  <br/>\nThis wonder of an Elephant  <br/>\nIs very like a spear!” <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Third approached the animal,  <br/>\nAnd happening to take  <br/>\nThe squirming trunk within his hands,  <br/>\nThus boldly up and spake:  <br/>\n“I see,” quoth he, “the Elephant  <br/>\nIs very like a snake!” <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Fourth reached out an eager hand,  <br/>\nAnd felt about the knee.  <br/>\n“What most this wondrous beast is like  <br/>\nIs mighty plain,” quoth he;  <br/>\n“ ‘Tis clear enough the Elephant  <br/>\nIs very like a tree!” <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Fifth, who chanced to touch the ear,  <br/>\nSaid: “E’en the blindest man  <br/>\nCan tell what this resembles most;  <br/>\nDeny the fact who can  <br/>\nThis marvel of an Elephant  <br/>\nIs very like a fan!” <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Sixth no sooner had begun  <br/>\nAbout the beast to grope,  <br/>\nThan, seizing on the swinging tail  <br/>\nThat fell within his scope,  <br/>\n“I see,” quoth he, “the Elephant  <br/>\nIs very like a rope!” <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so these men of Indostan  <br/>\nDisputed loud and long,  <br/>\nEach in his own opinion  <br/>\nExceeding stiff and strong,  <br/>\nThough each was partly in the right,  <br/>\nAnd all were in the wrong!  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you to to google and look for something like &quot;blind men and the  <br/>\nelephant,&quot; you&#39;ll also find non-poetic versions, older, from India.  Here&#39;s  that poem, <br/>\nthough: _<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wordfocus.com/word-act-blindmen.html_\">http://www.wordfocus.com/word-act-blindmen.html_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wordfocus.com/word-act-blindmen.html)\">http://www.wordfocus.com/word-act-blindmen.html)</a>  <br/>\nwith some notes.  It was by John Godfrey Saxe, an American. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there is a really deep KNOWING that feels like religious fervor, and  I&#39;m <br/>\nguessing Jay was feeling these truths about children and parents in that  part <br/>\nof his being.<br/>\n <br/>\nHoward Gardner&#39;s fans and followers have proposed another intelligence that  <br/>\nGardner didn&#39;t name originally: Existential  It would be #9 or 10, I  think.  <br/>\nOriginally there were 7 and he named nature intelligence as an  addition <br/>\nlater.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThere&#39;s a place in the brain that&#39;s been mapped now that is where religious  <br/>\nexperience lives.  <br/>\n <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crystalinks.com/medbrain.html_\">http://www.crystalinks.com/medbrain.html_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crystalinks.com/medbrain.html)\">http://www.crystalinks.com/medbrain.html)</a>  (good  article near the end, but other stuff is interesting too!)<br/>\n <br/>\nA good article on Andrew Newburg, a radiologist who&#39;s doing research on  <br/>\nmediation and prayer and brain response, and also another researcher, Rhawn  <br/>\nJoseph, is here:<br/>\n <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nj.com/specialprojects/index.ssf?/specialprojects/seekers/seekers3\">http://www.nj.com/specialprojects/index.ssf?/specialprojects/seekers/seekers3</a><br/>\n.html_ <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nj.com/specialprojects/index.ssf?/specialprojects/seekers/seekers3.html)\">http://www.nj.com/specialprojects/index.ssf?/specialprojects/seekers/seekers3.html)</a> <br/>\n <br/>\nTime Magazine did a big cover story a few years back with Andrew Newburg&#39;s  <br/>\nearly findings, but he&#39;s still working on it and knows more now.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I was a Baptist kid there were songs I really loved, and they  could <br/>\nevoke a GREAT religious experience in me (though I was sure God was  doing it to <br/>\nme, rather than me doing it to me).  They lose some of the  power without the <br/>\nmusic, the organ vibrating the pews, the others singing in  harmony...   but a <br/>\ngood sample of lyrics is here:<br/>\n <br/>\nI serve a living Saviour, He&#39;s in the world today;<br/>\nI know that He is living, whatever men may say;<br/>\nI feel His hand of mercy, I hear His voice of cheer,<br/>\nAnd just the time I need him, He&#39;s always near.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe lives!  He lives! Christ Jesus lives today;<br/>\nHe walks with me and talks with me along life&#39;s narrow way;<br/>\nHe lives! He lives, salvation to impart;<br/>\nYou ask me how I know he lives, he lives within my heart.<br/>\n <br/>\n[words by memory, and I might have misremembered a phrase, but will correct  <br/>\nlater if necessary]<br/>\n <br/>\nI knew there was a God.  I knew it from the depths of my being.<br/>\nGod loomed large in my life for many years.<br/>\n <br/>\nNow I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s a God (or if there is that&#39;s fine,  but it  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t concern me directly anymore), but I DO believe almost everything else on  <br/>\nyour list about how children&#39;s early years can help keep them strong  and whole <br/>\nand aware and so forth.  Is that as fragile a belief as  others?  Maybe so!  <br/>\n <br/>\nThe Pope acted on his beliefs and had a BIG damned funeral.  Lots of  people <br/>\nagreed with him.  Do numbers create truth?  Is there a God and  is he Catholic <br/>\nbecause that was one of the biggest crowds ever gathered on one  place?  Was <br/>\nGod Hindu when so many people gathered for Mahatma Ghandi&#39;s  funeral?  In each <br/>\ncase, the deceased had affected lives and  government policies.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nThe fervent beliefs of radical unschoolers changes the lives of other  people <br/>\nwho were already inclined to want to move toward mindful parenting and  <br/>\nliving compassionately with their own children.  There aren&#39;t too many of  us.  Not <br/>\na billion, certainly.  Maybe not many thousands.  Still,  if the beliefs and <br/>\npractices are workable and not harmful and we see good  results, that enforces <br/>\nour ideas and beliefs and some develop deep  convictions.<br/>\n <br/>\nDeep convictions can change, and they can be hard to live  by/with/through.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22010,"nextTopicId":22031}}
