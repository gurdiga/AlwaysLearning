People will speak to me<br/>\nand I catch myself not responding.  It isn&#39;t a conscious thing really, at<br/>\nleast not pre-meditated.  I just appear to be really enjoying the quiet<br/>\ninside my head and don&#39;t want it to be interrupted.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a fairly sociable person, lots of friends and activities, but since I<br/>\nwas a kid, I have enjoyed time to myself, to veg, to think, to just be.<br/>\nWhen I was first married and working, I used to come home from work and grab<br/>\nthe dogs, head out to the pasture to let them run and my head get quiet.<br/>\nThen we moved and I used to run until I couldn&#39;t hear the talking in my mind<br/>\nanymore  (I don&#39;t really hallucinate :)  I just mean the running commentary<br/>\nthat tends to go on inside our heads).  Now with 5 kids, it is really hard<br/>\nfor there to ever be a time when either my own thoughts aren&#39;t going or<br/>\nsomeone isn&#39;t asking me a question.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest will occasionally say &quot;Mom, I&#39;m talking to you.&quot;  It used to hurt<br/>\nher feelings (which I feel bad about because it isn&#39;t a conscious thing) but<br/>\nI explain what the deal is and then work to give her my full attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found that sitting zazen helps tremendously, giving me that time to<br/>\n&quot;be&quot;.  Sorry this is so long.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2839,"nextTopicId":2728}}
