He was<br/>\nreally interesting and wonderful. He spent a lot of time talking about how<br/>\nhis drawings or book ideas sometimes don&#39;t work out, so he sets them aside<br/>\nand starts something new.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said he often doesn&#39;t finish books - he loses interest or realizes it<br/>\nwon&#39;t work or can&#39;t figure out a problem. Sometimes they&#39;ll sit around for<br/>\nyears, then he&#39;ll go back and work on them again or take an idea out of them<br/>\nand start a new book. Made a big impression on my oldest daughter, who has<br/>\n*numerous* unfinished projects that she dips back into. That&#39;s how the<br/>\nprofessionals work &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone in our family has writing and other projects, some of which date<br/>\nback years, and our space is kind of mismatched and pack-ratty and full of<br/>\nweird (and interesting!) things, but it works for us. I&#39;m looking forward to<br/>\nshowing them this link!<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes, Cara<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, Jan 7, 2011 at 11:33 AM, Joyce Fetteroll &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jfetteroll@...\">jfetteroll@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I thought this was cool.
