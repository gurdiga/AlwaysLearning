But he is not interested in details. He leaves it to me and I think trusts me in what I am doing.<br/>\nBecause he is a Dairy Farmer and we live in the barn it is easy to stay connected with him  and the kids can spend time with him if they are willing to be with him outside while he works. He works a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGigi , my five year old absolutely loves the cows and does spend many hours with dad outside. Sometimes over 12 hours. Sometimes 3 or 4 or less but she has lately been outside  all the time. Sometimes she chooses to work with him instead of a playdate or going somewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nMD is our 9 year old and he is a gamer .. He loves to be on the computer researching about his games. He is a lot like me in that way.<br/>\nDad would like for him to come out to be with him more. I have pointed out that when he does  spend time with MD doing something they both like , which is sports and trapping gophers/shooting pigeons, that MD will come out more to do what Brian is doing. So Brian has been doing that and MD has been helping dad doing chores just because. He drives the Gator ( an utility vehicle we use in the farm) to get cows in, he feeds corn and hay to the heifers or the calves. They have been having a great time together. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut back to the story. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning when we woke up Gigi and I went outside to help dad  set up pens inside the calf barn and move some calves. About 5 minutes later MD comes over and we are all working together and the kids are playing sometimes and helping others.<br/>\nI asked Gigi to go get me some rods just a few feet away while I was helping dad with a panel. She said:<br/>\n&quot; You go get it&quot;<br/>\nSo  I was  a little taken back  and having a knee jerk reaction that she should just go and do it.<br/>\nI  said to Brian:<br/>\n&quot;She always does stuff for you but when I ask her for something she always says that- You go get it-.&quot;<br/>\nI was a tiny bit aggravated!<br/>\nSo Brian said to me that he asks her for help and that sometimes she helps and sometimes she is busy doing something and does not help.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a light-bulb moment! He is so right!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here I am reading about that and writing to people to do exactly that, my husband has never read any discussions about chores and help and he is doing much better than me!<br/>\nI know he has seem me ask and accept a no many times and I know that probably influenced him. <br/>\nI usually handle a no gracefully.<br/>\nI am lucky he is such a great dad that can step in and be more reasonable than me the times and I am  having those moments.<br/>\nI know that having extended the principles of unschooling to my marriage and my relationship with Brian has absolutely been the difference in our lives and our family. I love our family and our life.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Preparing for Unschooling","postDate":"1316879635","msgId":63131,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGo1a3Vlais0Z3ZkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGo1ajRsdStrZ3UyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":63130,"nextInTopic":63133,"prevInTime":63130,"nextInTime":63132,"topicId":63071,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ******************* Sending kids to school isn t the same as a child choosing school - although things get muddy when kids are little and don t really know","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-928924050\">&quot;emstrength3&quot; &lt;emstrength@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Barring some major catastrophe, I will not even consider sending my children to school....  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;I give my kids lots of choices and options- going to school is not one of them.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*******************<br/>\n<br/>\nSending kids to school isn&#39;t the same as a child choosing school - although things get muddy when kids are little and don&#39;t really know anything about school yet, or are choosing between being bored and lonely at home and slightly less bored and frustrated at school. <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember thinking &quot;I suppose school is an option in an emergency&quot; when my kids were younger. It was actually a kind of relief, when Ray came back from living with his bio mom and we pulled him out of school, to realize that it wasn&#39;t really feasible to put him back in for *any* reason - the school had been in the process of expelling him. Somehow, knowing school was Not an option felt freeing and let me think more creatively about other options. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, if Morgan wanted to try school, I&#39;d certainly let her try. Then again, she&#39;s 10 and knows people in school, knows the bad points from their commentary and running into field trips at museums and such. When she was 5 and saying happy things about school based on what she was seeing on Blues Clues, I made sure she had the things she found attractive - a desk and an easel and some of those nice paint cups with the no-spill lids, a chalkboard and a lunchbox. She didn&#39;t really want school, just the trappings of school. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf a parent is home and engaged, its not hard to make home more interesting and appealing than school - saying &quot;better than school&quot; is kind of like &quot;better than a trip to the Department of Motor Vehicles&quot;! If a parent isn&#39;t able to be home and engaged, that&#39;s a problem - that&#39;s The problem, not what to have the kids do in the meantime.  <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Preparing for Unschooling","postDate":"1316879266","msgId":63130,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEEwNkJFNEM4LUQ2NjYtNDhFRS1CMDhDLTc3NzQ4MkY4MjhEMEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGo1a3N0dStuOGJsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGo1a3N0dStuOGJsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":63129,"nextInTopic":63131,"prevInTime":63129,"nextInTime":63131,"topicId":63071,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Only with Unschooling do we have a significant difference in opinion as far as how we want to raise our girls.  Last year, DH was home most of the year while I worked and I deferred to what worked for him since he was the primary caregiver.  He has given lip-service to me about letting me choose how to approach school since now I will be the primary caregiver as long as he is working (no end date for now) but his job will become a 3 day a week position soon, so we will definitely need to be in agreement about school and childcare.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel that I have a tendency to judge him rather than empathize.  He&#39;s a better father when he has more time away from the girls.  His ability to be patient and calm with them is greatly challenged when he spends a lot of time with them.  I see DDs rebelling against him, arguing with him, mostly due to the limits he&#39;s trying to apply consistently.  But, when I suggest that, he insists that the things he is trying to limit are the problem.  I need some tools to empathize and help him find calm and perspective during those times.  I tend to either argue with him (though I am getting better at not doing that) or inject myself into the situation and relieve him.  But I feel I am not ultimately helping DH find a way to deal with things better.

I should mention that she attempts to latch on without asking while I&#39;m nursing my 2.5 year old at bedtime.  My reaction (without thinking -- like a reflex) was to immediately nudge her off.

And her talking about a &quot;bully&quot; may mean that she needs some guidance as to how to deal with this child. If she is committed to continuing at school and you keep pressuring her to come home, homeschooling isn&#39;t going to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if she starts staying home more and more, you run the risk of getting in trouble for truancy, right? If she&#39;s torn about school -v-home, I might ask her what she likes about school and what she doesn&#39;t and then work on getting her more of what she wants at home.  If it&#39;s the social aspect of being with a big group of kids, find homeschoolers her age in your area, join Daisy Scouts or 4H, gymnastics, dancing, etc. If she really likes art make sure you have lots of good materials available for her all the time. <br/>\n<br/>\nRe your husband, would he be on board with &quot;relaxed homeschooling&quot; if he is not fully on board with unschooling? <br/>\n<br/>\nwhat you said the two of you did not agree on is:<br/>\n- what Unschooling or radical Unschooling is<br/>\n- releasing limits on TV, &quot;junk&quot; food, sleep<br/>\n- trying to say &quot;yes&quot; when and however possible so long as it is not an infringement on another&#39;s rights or needs<br/>\n- partnership to children vs. authoritarian parenting<br/>\n- how to balance priorities (children, parents, practical needs, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you really need him to agree on all those things before you pull your child from school if school is not working? And I don&#39;t mean go against his wishes, just that maybe you could ease into it a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s fair to say that my husband wasn&#39;t fully on board with unschooling when we decided to homeschool, but we were in full agreement that we should bring Joseph (my oldest) home if that&#39;s what he wanted. He totally agreed with not following a curriculum and not requiring certain subjects. BUT he WAS concerned about his &quot;keeping up&quot; with his classmates in case it didn&#39;t work out for some reason, and ultimately he left it to me to make sure that happened. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe agreed with unschooling as an &quot;educational philosophy&quot;, but not so much a &quot;lifestyle&quot; or approach to parenting. Easing restrictions on TV, requiring chores, etc. and doing away with punishments came more gradually. There were definitely things that we would agree to try for a while and see what happened, and usually he saw the benefit in a short period of time rather than wanting to go back.<br/>\n<br/>\nAround here, I&#39;m the one that still struggles with &quot;junk&quot; food (though that&#39;s not a term I use). If your husband is concerned about what the kids are eating but you want to give your children freedom to eat what they want when, maybe just make sure there&#39;s nothing he considers &quot;junk&quot; in the house and give them freedom to choose that sort of thing when you&#39;re on outings, etc. That way your not setting up an adversarial &quot;either I say no to my children or upset my husband&quot; type situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Am I getting too much back into school concerns?

I don&#39;t  know that my son, now 9, really even grasps that what we do is &quot;unschooling,&quot; but we have talked about different types of homeschooling and ways of learning because he has friends that do school-at-home and was completely baffled when one asked him what time he starts school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never said, &quot;Now you can watch as much TV as you want.&quot; I just stopped saying no. I don&#39;t know that he even noticed. We never said &quot;No more bedtimes&quot; we just stopped saying &quot;It&#39;s 8 o&#39;clock; time for bed.&quot; (Which is not to say that we don&#39;t ever help them into bed early if they seem tired and need it, it&#39;s just not arbitrary anymore.) <br/>\n<br/>\nWe left the decision to come home to our kids. I was pretty sure I wanted to pull Joseph out before the end of first grade, but knew that it had to be his decision if we had a fighting chance of having homeschooling work. We made that summer very sparkly for the kids, and then when we talked about school -v- homeschooling, I made it clear that our way of homeschooling would be just like what we had been doing all summer long, not just recreating school in our house. <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela in NJ<br/>\nwith Joseph, 9; Hannah, 6; and Miriam, almost 4</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Preparing for Unschooling","postDate":"1316790483","msgId":63083,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMTY3OTA0ODMuMTc5NzAuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTA2Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEQzNjdGMUVGLUJGNUUtNEVBOS04MDgwLTdENEU3MUEzREU3REB5YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDQ4NTgzNDAxLTYwOTUtNDM3Qy04Mjg3LUE0QUZBQTA3MDJGNUB5YWhvby5jb20+IDw2ODFFRkZGNi04Q0FDLTRGOEQtQkFBNi0wRENBRUZEMzRFNjBAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDxEMzY3RjFFRi1CRjVFLTRFQTktODA4MC03RDRFNzFBM0RFN0RAeWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":63080,"nextInTopic":63084,"prevInTime":63082,"nextInTime":63084,"topicId":63071,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"When my younger brother was an infant and I was 5 years old I asked my mom to nurse.

When she wants to go, she is happily wakes up early and practically bolts out te door.  What is unusual is she has recently been asking to nurse at bedtime though she weaned (abruptly and tearfully) during DD2&#39;s pregnancy when DD1 was 2.5.  I started to wean her because I could not endure the nursing physically or emotionally though I had hoped to tandem nurse.  DD1 did choose to own the weaning herself by saying that she didn&#39;t want to nurse anymore.  DD1 has also intensified her skin eating habit (off her fingertips -- ouch).  I notice that there is an amount of stress and sibling rivalry that has intensified since she started school, and have (with suggestion from this list) told her that to continue going to her school, she must be respectful of her little sister&#39;s need to be and to feel safe in her own home.<br/>\n<br/>\nDD2 is enrolled at the free-play preschool DD1 had attended for two years prior.  Today was the second day she went.  I agreed to send her today on the condition that the teachers call me if and when DD2 asks for me or to nurse so that I could come get her.  DD2 is very familiar and comfortable at this preschool and with the teachers, but I was working the last school year and hardly saw my children during their waking hours.  There were far too many tearful and hysterical goodbyes during that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want DD2 to stay home with me right now, but DD2 at 2.5 very much imitates DD1 and with DD1 going to school, DD2 wants to go, too.  But DD2 all of last week said that she hated the preschool and wanted to stay with me.  So, she didn&#39;t attend.  Last night, she packed her own lunch for school and couldn&#39;t get there soon enough this morning.  She also told us when she wanted to give DH and I goodbye kisses.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told DD2 that if she wanted mommy or to nurse to tell the teachers and I would come get her.  She smiled when I said this and sure enough, this morning before her scheduled pick-up, DD2 told her teacher she wanted her family to come get her.  I went to pick her up.  She was thrilled to see me and started tidying her markers singing a tidying song.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe teachers have expressed that while they are OK doing this today, that they don&#39;t want to do this long-term.  The school&#39;s position is that 2 and 3 year olds begin processing their dependence and independence and that the school wants to help the kids figure out these challenges on their own and/or with the teachers&#39; help.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy take on the school&#39;s stance is that it is in the school&#39;s interest to help kids separate from their parents and bond more to the teachers rather than prioritize the child&#39;s expressed needs and desires to reconnect with their primary caregiver (who they usually ask for).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy priority is to empower my 2.5 year old with regard to her separation from me and to re-establish her trust that I am available for her since I was unavailable for the better part of a year.  DH thinks that DD2 attending school would fulfill my need for time to take care of some business things and bills as I do complain about lack of time.  He also doesn&#39;t want to lose our spot at this school (small and in high demand) not to mention piss them off.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have suggested getting a mother&#39;s helper instead so that I can get work done during business hours but DD2 could check in with me as she needed to.  I know this would take time and energy that we don&#39;t really have right now.  Not to mention, it is my experience that it is extremely difficult to find fun, affordable, respectful caregivers in our area.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven these things, I suggested the school call me when DD2 asks for me.  I thought it would be a good current resolution taking into account everyone&#39;s concerns and desires.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, knowing that the school in the long-term will not honor DD2&#39;s requests for me, I am feeling I should take her out altogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, I feel I have been doing my best to balance DH, and DDs&#39; expressed needs and desires against my own strong desire to unschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter attending the Good Vibrations conference, seeing Holly Dodd and Rose Sorooshian&#39;s self-assuredness and sparkliness, saying yes more myself, having more fun and also reflecting on ideas expressed in &quot;Hold On To Your Kids&quot;, I have different lenses than the rest of my family.  I can see &quot;better&quot; as a destination from here, though here is satisfactory for the rest of my family.  The thing I am most concerned about is DDs&#39; becoming more interested in their peers for guidance and approval than being in a trusting, respectful partnership with their parents.  I feel school, even now is a slippery slope with what I am observing and the challenges I am dealing with their respective schools&#39; expectations and conditions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a consistent track record with projecting into the future and I can see that what is satisfactory for my family now will likely be unsatisfactory within 2 years&#39; time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, I am trying for balance and patience as I understand from what i&#39;ve gained on this list that I can&#39;t force Unschooling on my family.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have two questions:<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can i best balance my family&#39;s needs while preparing to unschool and have it be peaceful and joyful?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat kind of experience do successful Unschoolers have with regard to an older sibling wanting to nurse again?  My knee-jerk reaction is disgust at doing it, but I know that DD1 really wants to nurse, perhaps as a way to reconnect after the stress of separation...<br/>\n<br/>\nAs always, I greatly appreciate the thoughtful wisdom and feedback from this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nCeci<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iDon&#39;tAlwaysHaveItOnPhone</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63136,"nextTopicId":63090}}
