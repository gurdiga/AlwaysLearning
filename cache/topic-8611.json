We play on the Ayonae Ro Server and are officers in a guild we helped form.  Ayonae Ro is a newer server but was a split from 3 older servers so there is a high amount of higher level players.  We really like the Ayonae Ro server as most everyone we have encountered has been very friendly and polite.

(bafflement)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I play EQ, and have for some time.  I<br/>\nused to have my own guild on Drinal, but we didn&#39;t<br/>\nlike the server and changed to Ayonae Ro.  It&#39;s a good<br/>\nserver, even if the GMs are not very creative.  We had<br/>\nproblems with our initial guild there, so we started<br/>\nanother.  It is all adults though, and we are kinda<br/>\nrowdy, so we may not be the best guild if your kids<br/>\nwant to play.  We are not the tamest bunch, and we<br/>\ncuss in guild speak (gasp!) and tell adult jokes.  My<br/>\nhusband and I are both officers in the guild.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe guild is Blessed Union of Drunkards.  So if you<br/>\nget into Ayonae Ro and type /who all Blessed you will<br/>\nget a list of which of our folks are online.  There is<br/>\na long story behind that name, but it is a combination<br/>\nof a joke, and flippin the bird to Verant (the folks<br/>\nwho manage the game) for rejecting our first three<br/>\nchoices for guild name.  The name is supposed to<br/>\nreflect our rowdy and fun loving nature, and is a sort<br/>\nof therapy for me, with my alcoholic family<br/>\nbackground.  It reminds me to relax and let go about<br/>\nit a little, although we (my husband and I) do not<br/>\ndrink at all in real life.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you just want some hints and tips in game and are<br/>\nnot interested in the guild, we would still be happy<br/>\nto help you out.  It is a complex game to learn, but<br/>\nlots of fun.  It is particularly nice for us to be<br/>\nable to role play (which is a hobby we enjoy) without<br/>\nhaving to drag our kids out anywhere for games, which<br/>\nhas always been difficult at best.  The boys like to<br/>\nwatch us play too.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Ingah Ironhart) 32nd level Dwarven Warrior<br/>\n(Kharmanti) 11th level Dark Elven Enchanter</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8569,"nextTopicId":8580}}
