Is s/he out with people you don&#39;t approve of? In places you <br/>\ndon&#39;t approve of? Why?<br/>\n<br/>\n  To me it&#39;s the whole package. I can&#39;t imagine my 13 year old wanting <br/>\nto be out that late---and where would he be?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yes, it would matter where he was and whom he was with---but also <br/>\n*why* he would want/need to be out that late.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m thinking back to when Cameron was 13. he had no reason to be out <br/>\nthat late---nor anyway to get there or get back home. Unless I was the <br/>\nchauffeur (and then I&#39;d know where and when and who). It simply wasn&#39;t <br/>\nan issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It became an issue at 16 when he had a car and a license that allowed <br/>\nhim out past dark. But not an ISSUE issue. We always knew where he was <br/>\nand with whom. He has a cell phone. And he&#39;s not afraid to tell us <br/>\nwhere he is/what he&#39;s doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If I were to &quot;disapprove&quot;---well, I&#39;d tell him. We&#39;d talk. We&#39;d try to <br/>\nfind a better way for him to get what he&#39;s looking for.
