We&#39;ve <br/>\nnever &#39;schooled&#39;.... I&#39;ve been on and off this list over the last <br/>\nseveral years....<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m pulling the following from your email:<br/>\nMartha wrote:  &quot;So, I would love to attend park days regularly, meet <br/>\nmore homeschooling families, find a community, create a broader <br/>\nrange of kids my children can play with, make friends that can be <br/>\nthere when I have questions, need to hash something out about <br/>\nhomeschooling/unschooling.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s my guess that you are lonely and would like more contact with <br/>\nlike-minded adults for ideas and support.  It&#39;s my guess that THAT <br/>\nis a very REAL feeling for many people.  I know that I have had lots <br/>\nof experience with that.  How can you take care of your needs?  <br/>\nWhere is your husband in this?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a pretty picture of you and your kids going to sunny parkday <br/>\nevents and having a joyous time... you ain&#39;t got that... and you <br/>\ndon&#39;t get to decide for your kids what they want/need....<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, take care of YOU... &quot;Believing is Seeing&quot;... So, believe you can <br/>\nget your needs met and opportunities for you to make that happen <br/>\nwill arise...<br/>\n<br/>\nIf YOU want to go to park day, then make arrangements for your kids <br/>\nat home so YOU can go... IF YOU want community, then create it... <br/>\n<br/>\nI belive that taking care of ourselves and the process of finding <br/>\ncreative ways to do so are TREMENDOUS gifts and lessons to our <br/>\nchildren....<br/>\n<br/>\nThe martyr of &quot;Okay, you don&#39;t want to go so we won&#39;t go&quot; or &quot;I <br/>\nREALLY want to go but I can&#39;t because you won&#39;t agree to it&quot;, imo, <br/>\ncreates a victim attitude - a really really poor modelling, imo...<br/>\n<br/>\nAside from that, be careful of what you ask for... do some searching <br/>\nand be clear....<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there some &#39;picture&#39; you&#39;re trying to create of the homeschooling <br/>\nfamily you envisioned?<br/>\nor is there a need you have for connection and support?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the family, YOU count, too....<br/>\nImo, it&#39;s easier to say either &quot;it&#39;s MY way&quot; OR &quot;fine, it&#39;s your <br/>\nway&quot;....<br/>\nThe greater difficulty, and imo, the greater gain/gift is in &quot;hmm, <br/>\nyou have your idea and I have my idea... how can we work it out?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAND then another aside....<br/>\nMy 10yo son likes to stay home... has always preferred that....<br/>\nWhat I learned from him...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do I feel I need to leave the house to do something or be <br/>\nhappy?  He is happy every day staying at home.  Why aren&#39;t I?  I had <br/>\na beautiful home, beautiful yard, lots of nice things....what was my <br/>\nproblem?  What would happen if I copied his simple happiness and <br/>\nstayed home for a week?  What could I accomplish?  What could I <br/>\nlearn from that?  Well, I learned a LOT from that and that&#39;s another <br/>\nstory... : )<br/>\n<br/>\nThat reminds me of an experiment I did several times about 5 years <br/>\nago, I did a week of not going anywhere (other than taking my kids <br/>\nto whatever classes they had), not answering the phone (I did listen <br/>\nto messages and briefly return &#39;important calls&#39;), not looking at <br/>\nemail, and not speaking to my kids until spoken to or only <br/>\nif &#39;necessary&#39;...  (I did arrange a playdate for my daughter mid-<br/>\nweek because that was her preference)....  The last &#39;rule&#39; was in <br/>\nresponse to my inclination to have my interactions be &quot;Look at the <br/>\nbird!&quot;  &quot;Lunch is ready.&quot; etc... I wanted to stop interrupting their <br/>\nown play, thoughts, etc...  Although I wanted to slow down my/our <br/>\nlives, it was not my intent to create stress for them, when I had <br/>\narranged for them to be with friends for one afternoon so I could go <br/>\nfor a meditative hike and the youngest insisted on going with me, I <br/>\ntook him along with me...  The kids could call people and I did not <br/>\nhold strictly to the &#39;rules&#39;... I gave myself permission to do the <br/>\nexperiment imperfectly... : )<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a good week from which I learned a lot... the house was <br/>\nquieter and more peaceful.... I found myself thinking, &quot;I don&#39;t have <br/>\nanything to do in this house except clean, cook and check emails!  I <br/>\nneed a hobby!  I need a life!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also led me to look at the unhappiness in my life... and I&#39;ve <br/>\nsince made lifestyle changes...  In that week, I had time to be <br/>\nquiet and slow.... I think I&#39;ve done it 3 times.... <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is reading this now and suggests I do it again... : )  <br/>\nPerhaps I will...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, Martha, these are my ramblings in response to your post... <br/>\n<br/>\nIf anything I&#39;ve written speaks to you or is helpful, I&#39;d enjoy <br/>\nhearing about it... If not, this is just an exercise for me to <br/>\nremind myself to take care of myself...<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes...<br/>\nJane<br/>\nP.S. One more thing... I&#39;ve always had a FABULOUS community of like-<br/>\nminded adults locally.... I am TREMENDOUSLY lucky with the <br/>\nunschooling/homeschooling community here and a community center <br/>\nwe&#39;ve created... NONETHELESS, I needed time away from them to <br/>\naddress my own loneliness.... being with them kept me busy and gave <br/>\nme a fix to &#39;get by&#39;... taking the time-out from them allowed me to <br/>\nlook at my life singularly as opposed to going through the motions <br/>\nof activities, conversations, etc....  just another 2 cents....<br/>\nGood luck!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":187238593,"authorName":"mommyhey","from":"&quot;mommyhey&quot; &lt;mh9@...&gt;","profile":"mommyhey","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: At odds","postDate":"1162992093","msgId":27303,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVpc2xrdCtucDI4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwM2YwMWM3MDMxNyRlYmRiY2MxMCQ0MDAxYThjMEBEYXZpZD4="},"prevInTopic":27302,"nextInTopic":27304,"prevInTime":27302,"nextInTime":27304,"topicId":27297,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks for all of the responses.

We live in Los Angeles. I<br/>\nhave known <br/>\nsince our oldest was 1 that I wanted to try homeschooling. In putting<br/>\nhomeschooling into <br/>\npractice for our family, I have come to realize the beauty and merits of<br/>\nunschooling. I <br/>\nbelieve in it whole-heartedly in theory. I&#39;m having a little difficulty<br/>\nthese days believing it<br/>\nin practice! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy basic challenges (and forgive me if this becomes long-winded): Finding a<br/>\nbalance <br/>\nbetween what they want and need and what I want and need. Unschooling<br/>\nappeals to me <br/>\nin many ways, the biggest one being the freedom it offers. Our schedule is<br/>\nour own. The <br/>\nworld is our oyster. This (theoretically) offers the potential, time and<br/>\nfreedom to find other<br/>\nlike-minded people and to create a community: attend various park days<br/>\n(there are many <br/>\nto choose from in Los Angeles!), try classes, explore. I like meeting new<br/>\npeople and I am <br/>\nfed by being with people who ask some of the same questions I ask, think in<br/>\na similar way, <br/>\nchallenge themselves in a similar way (who doesn&#39;t?). As a homeschooling<br/>\nparent, I seek <br/>\nlocal community for support. I/we are in the minority having chosen this<br/>\nunschooling <br/>\nlifestyle. And it helps me  especially when I&#39;m doubting our choices,<br/>\nfeeling lonely and <br/>\nvulnerable because our &quot;alternative lifestyle&quot;  to know there are others<br/>\nout there seeking <br/>\nthe same things and often struggling with the same things. So, I would love<br/>\nto attend park <br/>\ndays regularly, meet more homeschooling families, find a community, create a<br/>\nbroader <br/>\nrange of kids my children can play with, make friends that can be there when<br/>\nI have <br/>\nquestions, need to hash something out about homeschooling/unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids on the other hand like the friends they already have (most of their<br/>\nfriends go to <br/>\nschool). They have no interest in meeting new people, no interest in park<br/>\ndays or <br/>\nhomeschooling field trips and outings. They like being home for the most<br/>\npart and usually <br/>\n&quot;complain&quot; when we have to go anywhere, even if it&#39;s just to the grocery<br/>\nstore for milk. I <br/>\nlike being home, too. I can always find stuff to do here and we have a good<br/>\ntime together. <br/>\nBut I need more, and they don&#39;t seem to.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are countless opportunities in our general area: classes, outings,<br/>\nmeetings, parties. I<br/>\nusually chomp at the bit to attend. My kids put their foot/feet down and<br/>\nsay, &quot;No.&quot; Or, <br/>\nthey agree to try something but when the day comes, they change their minds<br/>\nand just <br/>\nwant to stay home. I have on occasion &quot;dragged&quot; them to events and sometimes<br/>\nthey are <br/>\npleasantly surprised at how much fun they had, and other times they are<br/>\nbored or <br/>\nuncomfortable and want to leave. They seem to remember the latter times<br/>\nmore. And our <br/>\noutings are so few and far between that the kids have yet to form bonds with<br/>\nother <br/>\nhomeschool kids. Our oldest attends a science class for homeschoolers<br/>\nonce/week and he <br/>\nlikes it. But he doesn&#39;t seek out any of the kids outside of the class. Just<br/>\ntoday I asked if he<br/>\nwanted to set up a play time with one of the boys he has had conversations<br/>\nwith in class. <br/>\nBut my son just shrugged his shoulders and said, &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; and walked<br/>\naway.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m frustrated.  I read daily about our local homeschool groups and their<br/>\npark days and <br/>\nideas and plans, and I&#39;m jealous, feel like I&#39;m on the outside looking in at<br/>\na world I&#39;d love <br/>\nto be a part of. I do have confidence that things will change over time and<br/>\nthat we will find <br/>\na different groove, one in which we all are more content. They are young and<br/>\nwe are still <br/>\nfinding our way being so new to homeschooling/unschooling. But until then,<br/>\nI&#39;m at a loss.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have tried speaking with the kids about my frustrations, explaining that<br/>\nI&#39;d like to meet <br/>\nmore homeschoolers, find friends they like who can play during the day, that<br/>\nI&#39;d like to try <br/>\nmore classes or outings. But the conversation doesn&#39;t go far as they like<br/>\nthings the way <br/>\nthey are and they can&#39;t seem to vocalize whey they aren&#39;t interested in park<br/>\ndays, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like I&#39;m missing out on a richer experience that is waiting to be<br/>\nhad. I feel there is<br/>\npotential for a more satisfying community but that my kids are a barrier to<br/>\nme/us finding <br/>\nthat (to them it seems our life is rich enough just the way it is). I want<br/>\nto honor their needs<br/>\nand desires. They are more &quot;shy&quot; or &quot;hesitant&quot; than I am and I can<br/>\nunderstand that park<br/>\ndays must seem overwhelming to them given they don&#39;t know anyone very well.<br/>\nBut <br/>\nregularly feel like it&#39;s me who is compromising instead of us finding a<br/>\nwin/win for <br/>\neveryone. We have a very rich home life. But some days it feels too solitary<br/>\nfor my liking <br/>\nand I want some outside stimulation, want to hang with<br/>\nhomeschooling/unschooling<br/>\nfamilies and not strictly school families.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy apologies for the length of this email.

The years have flown by and although I&#39;ve missed<br/>\nmany park days I don&#39;t regret it one bit because I spent those years<br/>\nfocusing on their needs and they are whole and happy and wonderful to be<br/>\naround.<br/>\n <br/>\nChanging my focus helped me but so did finding other ways to socialize.<br/>\nEmail lists were very helpful in those early days of unschooling when I<br/>\nneeded the support of other parents who were going through similar things.<br/>\nSo was talking on the phone and visiting my extended family, which the kids<br/>\nusually liked to do.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy girls are not quite the home bodies that they once were now that they are<br/>\na little older.

So, I would love to attend park <br/>\ndays regularly, meet more homeschooling families, find a community, create a broader <br/>\nrange of kids my children can play with, make friends that can be there when I have <br/>\nquestions, need to hash something out about homeschooling/unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids on the other hand like the friends they already have (most of their friends go to <br/>\nschool). They have no interest in meeting new people, no interest in park days or <br/>\nhomeschooling field trips and outings. They like being home for the most part and usually <br/>\n&quot;complain&quot; when we have to go anywhere, even if it&#39;s just to the grocery store for milk. I <br/>\nlike being home, too. I can always find stuff to do here and we have a good time together. <br/>\nBut I need more, and they don&#39;t seem to.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are countless opportunities in our general area: classes, outings, meetings, parties. I <br/>\nusually chomp at the bit to attend. My kids put their foot/feet down and say, &quot;No.&quot; Or, <br/>\nthey agree to try something but when the day comes, they change their minds and just <br/>\nwant to stay home. I have on occasion &quot;dragged&quot; them to events and sometimes they are <br/>\npleasantly surprised at how much fun they had, and other times they are bored or <br/>\nuncomfortable and want to leave. They seem to remember the latter times more. And our <br/>\noutings are so few and far between that the kids have yet to form bonds with other <br/>\nhomeschool kids. Our oldest attends a science class for homeschoolers once/week and he <br/>\nlikes it. But he doesn&#39;t seek out any of the kids outside of the class. Just today I asked if he <br/>\nwanted to set up a play time with one of the boys he has had conversations with in class. <br/>\nBut my son just shrugged his shoulders and said, &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; and walked away.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m frustrated.  I read daily about our local homeschool groups and their park days and <br/>\nideas and plans, and I&#39;m jealous, feel like I&#39;m on the outside looking in at a world I&#39;d love <br/>\nto be a part of. I do have confidence that things will change over time and that we will find <br/>\na different groove, one in which we all are more content. They are young and we are still <br/>\nfinding our way being so new to homeschooling/unschooling. But until then, I&#39;m at a loss.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have tried speaking with the kids about my frustrations, explaining that I&#39;d like to meet <br/>\nmore homeschoolers, find friends they like who can play during the day, that I&#39;d like to try <br/>\nmore classes or outings. But the conversation doesn&#39;t go far as they like things the way <br/>\nthey are and they can&#39;t seem to vocalize whey they aren&#39;t interested in park days, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like I&#39;m missing out on a richer experience that is waiting to be had. I feel there is <br/>\npotential for a more satisfying community but that my kids are a barrier to me/us finding <br/>\nthat (to them it seems our life is rich enough just the way it is). I want to honor their needs <br/>\nand desires. They are more &quot;shy&quot; or &quot;hesitant&quot; than I am and I can understand that park <br/>\ndays must seem overwhelming to them given they don&#39;t know anyone very well. But <br/>\nregularly feel like it&#39;s me who is compromising instead of us finding a win/win for <br/>\neveryone. We have a very rich home life. But some days it feels too solitary for my liking <br/>\nand I want some outside stimulation, want to hang with homeschooling/unschooling <br/>\nfamilies and not strictly school families.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy apologies for the length of this email. I look forward to hearing any ideas (or even just <br/>\nempathy :-) anyone has. And thank you in advance!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMartha</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27318,"nextTopicId":27234}}
