My children are aged 23, 21,<br/>\n  and 17. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I can relate to where Nadine is coming from as although we unschooled for<br/>\n  years I was forever uneasy in my mind. Getting those definitions sorted out<br/>\n  helped me. I prefer the term &#39;learning naturally&#39; and believe that we learn<br/>\n  in each and every minute - it&#39;s like breathing. Sometimes what we learn<br/>\n  isn&#39;t what we thought we&#39;d learn from a particular moment in time, but<br/>\n  we&#39;re learning all the time. Unschooling is an okay definition and serves a<br/>\n  useful purpose but some people believe it&#39;s akin to permissive parenting<br/>\n  and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that at all. Homeschooling is too vague - it can<br/>\n  mean school at home, correspondence education or whatever. I&#39;ve done a<br/>\n  little of everything with my children in a conscious way, including part<br/>\n  time enrolment at school. The most successful approach to date is allowing<br/>\n  them to learn naturally. It&#39;s way more efficient than any other method and<br/>\n  seems to be able to encompass all methods of &#39;learning&#39;. For example,<br/>\n  Thomas, my youngest, is currently studying electronics by distance<br/>\n  education but he&#39;s learning how to make movies by mucking about with<br/>\n  cameras and his computer. He uses whatever learning tools/resources are<br/>\n  best suited to his need and interest. We helped him develop this skill over<br/>\n  time, mostly by example, but also by actively encouraging him to think<br/>\n  about his needs and wants and who he is as a person. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Being a homeschooling mum is an anxious business because we&#39;re going<br/>\n  against societal &#39;norms&#39;. It&#39;s hard to be different and stay up beat about<br/>\n  it all the time. I keenly felt the social isolation from homeschooling in<br/>\n  the early years - suddenly I couldn&#39;t visit my friends because their kids<br/>\n  were at school and they didn&#39;t want to be surrounded by other people&#39;s<br/>\n  kids... I think the social isolation hit me harder than my kids. Then I had<br/>\n  to deal with the insecurities that came with finding homeschooling families<br/>\n  that &#39;did it better&#39; than us! It took years to shut up the inner critic -<br/>\n  the one that whispered in my ear every day that I wasn&#39;t good enough, that<br/>\n  I would naturally fail my children, that other people could do it because<br/>\n  they were smarter, university educated, better mothers, had more money, had<br/>\n  gifted children, etc etc etc... Meanwhile people began to come to ME for<br/>\n  homeschooling advice! <br/>\n<br/>\n  The only thing I could do was offer what my heart felt to be true to the<br/>\n  inner child in me. <br/>\n<br/>\n  So, Nadine, what do YOU need to feel okay right NOW? Forget about your son,<br/>\n  forget about the critics, forget about the future even. Unless we look<br/>\n  after our own emotional well being we can&#39;t totally available to help<br/>\n  others, and sometimes we need to be, especially as mothers. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Sometimes I would ask my children to work from text books because it calmed<br/>\n  me down. I told them that there was a good chance they&#39;d learn something<br/>\n  useful from doing the exercises required of them in the books, and that<br/>\n  there was a good chance they wouldn&#39;t. But what WOULD happen is that my<br/>\n  momentary paranoia (&quot;my children aren&#39;t learning anything! I&#39;m not a good<br/>\n  homeschooling mum!&quot;) would disappear as I watched my children work. More<br/>\n  often than not they&#39;d breeze through the pages... somehow, without<br/>\n  practising writing they&#39;d be spelling words they hadn&#39;t been able to six<br/>\n  months before, or understood maths concepts without having learned them...<br/>\n  Life is a fantastic teacher and children are programmed to learn! And learn<br/>\n  they do, very efficiently, without our interference. A couple of weeks of<br/>\n  structured actitivies, which I meticulously recorded so that I could prove<br/>\n  to myself that my children were capapble learners the next time I lapsed<br/>\n  into a bout of depression or gave into insecurities. The kids knew that<br/>\n  they were doing bookwork to help me, not to learn anything in particular.<br/>\n  THis made it easy for all us - the motivation was REAL, even if the<br/>\n  activity itself wasn&#39;t...<br/>\n<br/>\n  My children grew up confident that they could learn anything they wanted to<br/>\n  at any time in their lives and that self-motivation is the key. As young<br/>\n  adults my children are now learning that knowing oneself is the key to<br/>\n  self-motivation. A lot of the things they think they want aren&#39;t happening<br/>\n  - and they are discovering that it&#39;s because other people expect them to<br/>\n  want those things, or they thought that other people wanted them to. As<br/>\n  they discover more about who they are as individuals they are finding that<br/>\n  achieving what they really want is very easy. When you are doing what you<br/>\n  love life comes easy. I found that untangling myself from the expectations<br/>\n  of others, both in my mind and in theirs, one of the hardest things to do<br/>\n  in my life. And it took 45 years. I watch my 17 year old and see that he&#39;s<br/>\n  almost conquered that goal already... thanks to learning naturally! He is<br/>\n  our only child not tainted by school experience and who has had the least<br/>\n  amount of homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thomas refused to do anything that didn&#39;t make sense to him. Often I would<br/>\n  need to explain why we do things the way we do, why it might be useful for<br/>\n  him to consider doing things. He&#39;d consider them and then, more often than<br/>\n  not, say they still didn&#39;t make sense and continue to refuse to do them.<br/>\n  That made me bend my ways to find solutions that made sense in every which<br/>\n  way, not just for him or me, but for most people and situations. One of my<br/>\n  surprising discoveries is that life is actually very simple - the simplest<br/>\n  solution is often the most effective. <br/>\n<br/>\n  If a child doesn&#39;t want to draw right now, then teaching him how to draw<br/>\n  shadows right now doesn&#39;t make sense. When he wants to know how to draw<br/>\n  shadows he will find the right tools, and one of them may be to access a<br/>\n  tutor (book or person) that will show him. Or he might use observation and<br/>\n  experimentation. Schools suck because 99% of what they ask children to do<br/>\n  is contrived. That makes it pretty meaningless to most children. Some<br/>\n  children don&#39;t have access to a range of tools when they want to learn -<br/>\n  that&#39;s a sad fact related to how little we value children in our society.<br/>\n  Having made the decision to educate our children outside of schools we&#39;re<br/>\n  in a position to offer our children whatever tools for learning they need,<br/>\n  WHEN they need them, not before!<br/>\n<br/>\n  We wrote our own curriculum and educational program based on where our<br/>\n  children were at, what we wanted for them, and what they needed. I read the<br/>\n  national and state curriculum guidelines but most of it wasn&#39;t relevant to<br/>\n  one child learning outside of a classroom. And most of it was unrealistic -<br/>\n  particularly in the classroom setting. There is no accountability within<br/>\n  the school system - when the curriculum fails to deliver what it promises<br/>\n  for all children, the children and their families are blamed, not the<br/>\n  curriculum. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Sorry I&#39;ve rambled on so much. I&#39;ve been lurking for a few weeks and<br/>\n  haven&#39;t had the time to post before.
