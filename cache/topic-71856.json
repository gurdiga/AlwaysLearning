It was good for me.  I was looking for a reason to be complacent.  You may not be.  I was however, and her comment got me thinking about ways I could make our home more interesting. <br/>\n<br/>\nEthan, my son, likes to be home.  So, I focused on the home.  I purchased some fun posters, and put them up in various places around the house.  The kids loved those.  I would set up fun chemistry experiments.  Again, a big hit.  I downloaded new games.  I put several movies in our Netflix cue and ran them in the background while we played.  I got a couple new toys, and set them up.  I brought out old toys, and started playing with them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI did all of these things to see what captured Ethan&#39;s interest.  Some did.  Others did not.  But, it made our home more vibrant.  More dynamic.  More like a place that celebrated life and learning.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think if you feel like you&#39;re not doing enough.  Do more.  Have fun.

It often had an impact on what we needed to do that night.   Some things involved certain equipment or clothes or food, and we would get those things ready, or thawing, or in the laundry or whatever.  Some things involved going to sleep early, or taking a bath or shower, or putting down extra pet food, or finding something we were going to deliver to another family, or place.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it becomes the discussion of the night before, there are lots of advantages.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-it&#39;s sometimes difficult to meet everybody&#39;s needs.<br/>\nAnd when there&#39;re problems about deciding what we can all do I just leave<br/>\nand cook, wash...-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou said &quot;just.&quot;  If you could rephrase that (just above here), it would help you, I think.  <br/>\n -=-I just leave and cook, wash...-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThere must be other things to do besides out with friends, home with crafts.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are ideas here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/youngchildren\">http://sandradodd.com/youngchildren</a><br/>\nSome might be &quot;young,&quot; but many probably are workable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/physicality\">http://sandradodd.com/physicality</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":266347231,"authorName":"Annie Regan","from":"Annie Regan &lt;anniel_5@...&gt;","profile":"anniel_5","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Not sure if I&#39;m doing enough","postDate":"1375487721","msgId":71868,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRFNzRCMkM0LTg0RDMtNENDRC1BN0M4LUYyMDE2NUJFODNCM0B5YWhvby5jb20uYXU+"},"prevInTopic":71866,"nextInTopic":71869,"prevInTime":71867,"nextInTime":71869,"topicId":71856,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My eldest is also an 8 year old girl who asks every morning what we are doing/who we are seeing.

She would happily go out every day, while my other 2 kids, and I, function better if we have some home days in between our activity days. Caitlin seems to accept it more easily if I say &#39;today we&#39;ll be staying at home&#39; rather than saying that we&#39;ve got nothing planned. Sometimes she then thinks of something she&#39;d like to do at home, other times she wants some help finding something to do. I&#39;ve started leaving my grocery shopping until after my husband comes home from work, so then Caitlin can come with me and the others can stay at home. She&#39;s also doing a few activities that are on later in the day, so again, one parent can take her and the others can stay at home. This way even if we have a fairly quiet week she does get a number of outings. I also have friends come and pick her up if she really wants to go out and we don&#39;t - although this is harder if you live an hour away from friends - many of Caitlin&#39;s friends though do go to school so sometimes one of their mums picks her up after the school pick up and I go and get her later. If she knows there&#39;s a social thing happening later in the day she copes with being home for the rest of the day. She also talks on the phone to her best friend a lot, several short calls a day. Her friend doesn&#39;t have Skype yet but when she gets it I imagine they will spend a lot of time on Skype.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing that helps is after I&#39;ve said we&#39;re thing home for the day we sometimes talk about our plans for a future outing so she is reassured that being at home all day is not a permanent way of being. She&#39;d still like to go out more and see people more so we&#39;re always looking for ways to help that happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we are at home I don&#39;t expect everyone to be doing the same thing, they are often all working/playing at their own thing and then come together when they are interested in what the others are doing. So I might help caitlin get started on some jewellery making while the others are playing Lego or watching tv, and the day flows from there. I buy lots of craft and creative activities from op shops and discount stores so that I have lots to offer Caitlin when she feels stuck at home.<br/>\n<br/>\n(And it doesn&#39;t always run as smoothly as it sounds, but I&#39;m working on it)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnie<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":318512407,"authorName":"ckasse","from":"&quot;ckasse&quot; &lt;carmiya@...&gt;","profile":"ckasse","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Not sure if I&#39;m doing enough","postDate":"1375450962","msgId":71866,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGt0Z2QwaStmY3IwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGt0ZjlqcitidHRwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71862,"nextInTopic":71868,"prevInTime":71865,"nextInTime":71867,"topicId":71856,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I just started giving one day to each of my kids to plan.
