My children were then 9 and  13 and we were all <br/>\ntaking piano lessons and we all &quot;practiced&quot; several times a  week to be ready <br/>\nfor our weekly lessons which involved walking next door to my  sister&#39;s house. <br/>\n It was quickly evident to me that when we each just at  down and played <br/>\naround at the piano we were having much more fun than when we  practiced for the <br/>\nlessons.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI just stopped using the word &quot;practice&quot; and replaced it with&quot; playing&quot; and  <br/>\nstopped reminding anyone (including myself) that I needed to play to get ready <br/>\n for the next lesson.  The piano playing evolved.  We all eventually  stopped <br/>\ntaking lessons but both kids have continued with music in a gradual fun  way. <br/>\n My daughter sings and plays the guitar and my son plays the drums and  <br/>\nguitar.  Both have taken some other lessons but truly play for the  enjoyment of it <br/>\nwhen they feel like it.  I think if they had continued  to &quot;practice&quot; with my <br/>\nreminders on any instrument, they would have long ago  stopped playing.<br/>\n <br/>\nBoth children (now 14 and almost 18)  have this deep understanding and  love <br/>\nof music from just experimenting and playing together that completely  eludes <br/>\nme.  I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s because my &quot;older&quot; age &lt;g&gt; or  just my years of <br/>\nschooling that I have yet to conquer.  <br/>\n <br/>\nGail<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Practicing piano/guitar","postDate":"1183421369","msgId":29730,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDczQjUwNjg5LTE5QUEtNEI1Qi1BQzA2LTM5RDQ3OEQxMDJERkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDgzNzU4NC4yNDY1MC5xbUB3ZWI2MDAyMS5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDgzNzU4NC4yNDY1MC5xbUB3ZWI2MDAyMS5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":29729,"nextInTopic":29732,"prevInTime":29729,"nextInTime":29731,"topicId":29718,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We all know that practice can mean doing an activity over and over in order to build skills that are then used in the real thing.

I tend to use the word &quot;practice&quot; to differentiate a specific mindset and approach to my time with the guitar, as opposed to playing through pieces, or performing (sidenote: sometimes I practice performing...to work specifically on the skills associated with performing).  When I practice guitar, I am usually looking really closely at some element of my playing, and trying to think analytically about how I am working to improve it.  When I&#39;m playing, I&#39;m trying not to be analytical, but to allow the analytical skill set/framework that I built while practicing to give me a foundation for expression.  Ahem--all that to say that I think the word &quot;practicing,&quot; when applied to a willing participant who (like me) really enjoys the analytical thinking and the technical work, isn&#39;t a negative term.  However I can definitely see how all the years of<br/>\n people being told to practice has given it a negative connotation.  The fact is, if you don&#39;t absolutely love doing it (working in that analytical manner at technique, or on a specific section of a piece of music, or whatever), it&#39;ll be awful.  If you do, though, it&#39;s another tool in the bag to improve musicianship.  <br/>\n  I hope that&#39;s another helpful viewpoint.  Oh, an add-on thought:  I teach guitar at a music store, and I would always much rather a kid have fun with the instrument then trudge unhappily through required practice time.  I would rather someone say their kid wants to take a few months break, rather than send the kid in feeling like they&#39;ve failed because they didn&#39;t want to play guitar this week.<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:beanmommy2@...\">beanmommy2@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">           &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Instead of thinking of it as &quot;practicing, &quot;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>changing the term to <br/>\n&quot;playing&quot; might help too.
