And do any of them have a &quot;prey drive&quot; a natural interest in chasing things that move like squirrels, birds, bicycles.  This will make a VERY big difference in your search for a cat.  In many instances you can end up with cats and dogs sprinting through your house for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I have a friend with a border collie who I swear has cat OCD!  Her dog does not chase the cats and just stalks after them slowly and sits and watches them.  The cats are fine with this as she does not chase.  However, for the dog....she will not eat or drink when there is a cat around that she might get the chance to stare at....she will not eat/drink or do anything except stalk and stare for days until she is removed from the presence of the cat.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf one of your dogs has a strong &quot;prey drive&quot; to chase then I would advise caution in getting a cat as multiple dogs will excite and feed off the energy of one another and a cat can accidentally get hurt.  You should also make sure that the cat has escape routes where they can get away from the good natured dogs if they want.  I understand the dogs are just playing.  I often find that a ledge/shelf or a tall cat tree that the dogs can&#39;t reach or tip over works well.  Many large dogs can still get a good portion of their front bodies wedged under a bed.  My cats mostly end up trying to get on top of the highest reachable advantage point anyways.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know many people who have cat reactions that they decide they can live with, and often they adjust to their cat.  My husband also uses a naturopath who works in allergy or provocation neutralization for his non food based allergic reactions.  So far this has proven very helpful.  This might be helpful for cats allergies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you happen to live in the Seattle area:<br/>\n<br/>\nI would look to Pasado&#39;s Safe Haven for help in finding the right dog savvy cat.

After you&#39;ve had cactuses hurling themselves at  <br/>\nyour legs several times a day for 3 or 4 weeks and using your legs as  <br/>\ntrees to climb you&#39;re kinda done and it&#39;s easier to resist the 6 week  <br/>\nage when they&#39;re finally at that really cute stage ;-) (I didn&#39;t find  <br/>\nI was bothered by kitten dander so that&#39;s not a good test.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do adopt, I&#39;d strongly suggest an adult cat from a shelter.  <br/>\nWe&#39;d definitely not do kittens again because you can&#39;t know their  <br/>\npersonalities. Kathryn adores holding cats and ours just dislike being  <br/>\npicked up. They&#39;ll sit on laps. Snuggle up against you. Love to be  <br/>\npetted. But the one thing Kathryn really wanted was to be able to  <br/>\ncarry them around and they haven&#39;t given in in 10 years ;-) We worked  <br/>\nat the local shelter and there were loads of wonderful adult cats that  <br/>\ncame through there.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":454093105,"authorName":"lalow","from":"&quot;lalow&quot; &lt;lalougor@...&gt;","profile":"lalow66","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Getting a Cat","postDate":"1297597738","msgId":59727,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlqOGdmYSs0c21wQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":59728,"prevInTime":59726,"nextInTime":59728,"topicId":59727,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My kids want a cat.

I love dogs too.  I would go get the kids a cat today except for my son Ben&#39;s allergies.  Ben has lots of food allergies and when he was 2 we had him tested for all kinds of allergies to find out what was causing him to break out in hives all the time.  He tested positive at that time for many different foods and cats.  We had a cat at that time but when we moved we left the cat with a friend.  We never really noticed a reaction in particular to the cat.<br/>\nWhen Ben was four we had him retested for the main foods and cats.  He was still very allergic according to the skin pric test.  He is 8 now.  He remembers the test from when he was four and has declined being tested again as he said it really hurt.  He has been around cats at friends houses, pets them, plays with them and has had itchy eyes around them on some occasions but mostly not.  They (all my kids, Ben included) have been begging for a cat and quite honestly I am at a loss. I would just hate to get one and then have to give it back away due to his allergies being bad.  Ben loves animals and he really cant leave them alone so he will play with it.  I wouldnt want him to ever feel it was his fault but I am afraid at 8 it would be difficult not to feel that way.  Any ideas?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59761,"nextTopicId":59865}}
