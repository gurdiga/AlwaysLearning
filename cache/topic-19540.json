She wanted to go to grade 8 last year but <br/>\nwhen she found out she would probably miss the home-birth of her <br/>\nlittlest brother (all 9lbs, 2oz of him!)& due the beginning of Sept. <br/>\nshe decided she didn&#39;t want to go. She has never been to school.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has outside activities with other kids her age & does volunteer <br/>\nwork as well. She babysits for other families and goes to work with <br/>\nher dad & helps out filing & putting the paper copies of proposals <br/>\ntogether. There are other home-schooled kids near enough to us so she <br/>\ncan spend time with them too. There are other kids in our family to <br/>\nhang out with too. <br/>\n<br/>\nEven though she is around other hsed kids she says she feels &quot;weird&quot; <br/>\nbecause of some of our choices. Having a bigger family, fostering, <br/>\nbfing, bfing extended, home-birth, APing, etc. Even though they don&#39;t <br/>\nwatch much t.v. it as well as other friends they have through other <br/>\nactivities they are involved in are &quot;mainstream&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe looked into a couple of schools & she has chosen one. She is <br/>\nfriends with other kids who will be starting grade 9 there too. I <br/>\nknow the kids & they are pretty good kids from families that care <br/>\nabout their kids. Also since it is a small town school there will be <br/>\nkids coming from other small schools as well as a few rural schools. <br/>\nSo all the grade nines will be new & be meeting kids they&#39;ve never <br/>\nmet before. We are very rural!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have encouraged her to prepare herself so she is doing more reading <br/>\n& writing. But is really concentrating on her Math as well. She knows <br/>\nshe can come home if school doesn&#39;t turn out to be what she expects <br/>\nor wants. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a few other home-schooled kids near us who also chose <br/>\nto &quot;try&quot; high-school. Most of them jumped right into it & after a <br/>\nshort adjustment period they really enjoyed school and are still in <br/>\nor graduated. One is into college now!! Another couple of kids that <br/>\ntried decided they didn&#39;t like all of it so they spoke with the <br/>\nschool & chose to only take the courses they wanted & also told the <br/>\nschool they were going to choose themselves whether or not to write <br/>\nthe tests or do the assignments as they were looking to learn, not to <br/>\nget grades or credits. The school was fine with this too. Luckily <br/>\nthese kids were going to the same school my DD has chosen!! So no <br/>\nmatter her choice, the school has already had a variety of <br/>\nexperiences with home-schooled families.<br/>\n<br/>\nI needed to let my daughter make her choices, with my guidance, but <br/>\nthey are her own choices now. I have to trust in myself that through <br/>\nloving her & supporting her & sharing my values over the past 13+ <br/>\nyears that I have given her the strong roots she needs. As I have <br/>\nseen how wonderfully she has already sprouted I see that she now <br/>\nfeels she is ready to spread her wings. I think she is too, though it <br/>\nis bitter-sweet. I too will grow with her. Even though there are <br/>\nother kids at home, I will still miss her. Raising children also <br/>\ninvolves our lives changing as our own children&#39;s needs change too. <br/>\nI have realized that I need to start letting go of her even more so <br/>\nthat others can enjoy this wonderful person too.

Because they&#39;ve done eclectic &quot;lessons&quot; at home I don&#39;t think the issue of preparedness is as big in their minds, but I&#39;m hearing them go through most of the same other issues you are.  If you don&#39;t find the answers you are looking for here, I can e-introduce you to my friend for mutual comiseration.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy wild guess is that my friend&#39;s daughter will find high school to be a tiresome grind.  (But that was my guess when I thought she would be going to the big neighborhood school.  Now it looks like she will go to a charter school with only 100 kids, so maybe she will have a more personal and worthwhile experience.  I don&#39;t know.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the best person for you to talk to is someone whose kid followed this path last year.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes,<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59432230,"authorName":"Joanna Wilkinson","from":"&quot;Joanna Wilkinson&quot; &lt;Wilkinson6@...&gt;","profile":"joanna514","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"She wants to go to high school","postDate":"1084144223","msgId":19540,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM3bWRvdit2NWgwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":19541,"prevInTime":19539,"nextInTime":19541,"topicId":19540,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well, Carly has been on and off about maybe going to high school.

She doesn&#39;t want to never go and not know <br/>\nwhat it&#39;s really like.  She went to k and 1st, but high school is a <br/>\ndifferent thing and she has many people in her life telling her she <br/>\nwould get so much out of it.<br/>\nThe scool has a great drama dept. (we&#39;ve seen some of the shows and <br/>\nthey are good) and that is something she would like to get involved <br/>\nin.<br/>\nThis winter was particularly long and boring for her.  The large <br/>\nhsing community here is fundi xtians.  She has a few friends who are <br/>\nrelaxed, but no real unschoolers to hang with.  She&#39;s feeling a need <br/>\nfor more of a social life.  With Sam gone (who is her younger <br/>\nbrother who died last year), she is here with 2 littler ones and <br/>\nit&#39;s just not as interesting and stimulating around here for her.  <br/>\nShe is great with them, but she was use to having Sam here to bounce <br/>\nideas off of, to argue with, to make life a LOT more fun and <br/>\ninteresting.  She seems bored and lonely at times.<br/>\nI wish I had done better for her, but here we are, and she wants to <br/>\ngo to school.  I want to support her.  I want her to go and decide <br/>\nfor herself.  I hope she comes home after experiencing it and finds <br/>\nother ways to meet her needs (we&#39;ve discussed many, but she really <br/>\nwants to check out school).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;m looking at what she will need to not feel like she is <br/>\ntotally lacking in knowledge of the schooling kind.  I tried to <br/>\ngoogle for info on the high school she is going too, but didn&#39;t find <br/>\nspecifics.  I&#39;m thinking of an assessment type test for 9th graders <br/>\nthat will show what she might need to work on.  She hasn&#39;t done much <br/>\nschool type math (though I think she will pick it up easier than she <br/>\nthinks she will).  Does anyone know of a good route to take for this?<br/>\nI want her to feel confident, even when we both know the information <br/>\nneeded, is information ONLY needed for high school, not life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m feeling sad.    I feel like I&#39;m going to lose a part of who we <br/>\nare.  I feel so lucky to have had all this time with her, and feel <br/>\nlike maybe I have been selfish in some way.  I feel like, even <br/>\nthough she is only 13, the process of letting go has started.  She <br/>\nis becoming more independant, she is wanting to spread her wings and <br/>\nI can only trust her and love her and always be there for her to be <br/>\nher &quot;home&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve always thought unschooling was easy.  My work in coming to <br/>\nunschooling was a long, difficult process, but the actual <br/>\nunschooling, the hanging out with my kids, the trusting them and <br/>\nseeing how really amazing they are and letting them BE who they are <br/>\nwas easy to do.  But now I&#39;m feeling like this was definitely the <br/>\nharder path.  How easy it would be to say &quot;No. I am the mother, and <br/>\nyou will not go to school.&quot;  or to just send them to school and deal <br/>\nwith it like everyone else does.  Not too much thinking involved <br/>\nthere.  I don&#39;t want Carly to resent MY choices, so I have to let <br/>\nher make, and help her with, her choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe this will be a good thing.  I can see the first time an adult <br/>\ntreats her with disrespect (or someone near her), and her not taking <br/>\nit, or feeling so angry she never wants to return.  She has always <br/>\nthought of people, who treat kids as &quot;less than&quot;, as idiots, so it <br/>\nwill be interesting to see how she reacts to high school dynamics.  <br/>\nIt will be a learning process for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I do want her going with some confidence.  Any suggestions or <br/>\ninsight?  <br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19572,"nextTopicId":19578}}
