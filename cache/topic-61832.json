So in that specific situation we&#39;ve come up with &quot;for real, in the game&quot; or &quot;for real, in fairyland&quot;.  This allows Sylvia to know what&#39;s going on without them needing to be termed not-real. I think representing something as real is Camille&#39;s way of saying it&#39;s important to her.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCamille and I have been playing restaurant a lot lately, and we had a situation recently where Camille had told one of her very good friends that I make her pay me a penny for a drink of water and a quarter for food every time she&#39;s hungry.  She said this was for real. Her good friend asked his mom for a hundred dollars later that night because he was genuinely concerned that Camille might not be able to eat otherwise.  His mom explained to him that she had seen me bring and share plenty of food at parkday, so surely I feed my daughter freely.  When I explained this misunderstanding to Camille she realized that she needs to be careful about how she presents her stories.  I don&#39;t think she expected to be believed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs your son making things up to other people, or only to you?  It sounds like he doesn&#39;t want to be called out on it, and it may not be necessary if it&#39;s not hurting anyone. It might just be his way of livening things up.  Maybe it&#39;s more exciting to pretend that he saw 3 rats than not.  Could you play along in the spirit of imagination without actually pretending you believe him &quot;for real&quot;?  Maybe instead of thinking of it as truth vs. untruth, you could think of it as literal vs. imaginative ways of expression.
