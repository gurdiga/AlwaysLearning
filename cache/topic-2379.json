That is very cool. I can surely put up with it<br/>\nuntil then.<br/>\n<br/>\n(hold on, I&#39;m coming to the connection)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we retire we&#39;re going to move to upstate NY - the adirondacks to be<br/>\nmore precise. We like to go there for the summers. The kids do know<br/>\nother kids there, though we are pretty far from others - sort of out in<br/>\nthe boondocks. We spent one year up there a couple of years ago while dh<br/>\nwent to school in Boston. So we even know a bunch of homeschoolers.<br/>\n(just as a btw, with the couple of dozen families we know up there and<br/>\nhave done stuff with, never was religion ever even mentioned. I don&#39;t<br/>\neven know what anyone&#39;s religion is.)<br/>\n<br/>\nTo allow us to spend as much time as we wanted for as long as we wanted,<br/>\nwe decided that mil&#39;s cabin just wasn&#39;t going to cut it. So we bought an<br/>\nold fixer-upper farm house that we work on a bit every summer. If anyone<br/>\nreally is doing a road trip and ends up that way in the summer months,<br/>\nwe&#39;d be happy to have you. :-) We have some acres, a stream, beaver<br/>\nponds, and then there&#39;s always grandma&#39;s lake. If it is too cold for<br/>\ntents (or the coyotes scare ya) there&#39;s always the not-yet-done upstairs<br/>\nwhich includes multiple layers of grandma&#39;s teensy-weensy-flowers wall<br/>\npaper mixed in with a few assorted holes in the plaster. Hey, at least<br/>\nyou&#39;ll stay dry. :-) Also, we have two cats and two dogs.<br/>\n<br/>\ncat pee.....  My sil visited us here in FL last year. After I asked her<br/>\nto please leave her door open a little so the cat could get in to use<br/>\nthe litterbox in that bathroom, she closed it. My poor sweet Rosebud,<br/>\njust couldn&#39;t hold it any longer and decided to use the mat by the back<br/>\ndoor instead. I have used every concoction imaginable, (but if anyone<br/>\nhas some other idea, I&#39;d love to hear it) to try to get the smell up on<br/>\nthe rug and the mat. We don&#39;t smell it, but I think there must be some<br/>\nsort of smell, since whenever I leave a mat (just cotton things) down<br/>\n(and only at night for some reason) she&#39;ll pee on it. I can&#39;t figure it<br/>\nout. Without a mat the rug must still smell, but she leaves it alone. It<br/>\ncan&#39;t be a health thing, since as long as I pick up the mat at night she<br/>\nalways leaves the area alone and uses the litter box. Getting a male cat<br/>\nto not spray is much more difficult if they&#39;ve already done it. I agree<br/>\nthat getting them fixed as young as recommended (six months or even<br/>\nsooner - before they start spraying) is the way to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething I learned today - My spell checker didn&#39;t like two l&#39;s in<br/>\ntravelling, but my dictionary said the two l variation is British, so I<br/>\nleft them with two. Does anyone know if any others, besides George, in<br/>\nthe Travelling Willbury&#39;s are British? Or maybe a Willbury is a cute<br/>\nfurry British animal?
