My friend (a big John Holt fan) <br/>\nrecommended that she talk with me about unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsually when I talk about it, it&#39;s to someone who&#39;s skeptical about the whole <br/>\nhomeschooling idea---unschooling is just TOO far a leap. At the end, I&#39;m <br/>\nexhausted and depressed. Well, today was downright FUN! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess it helps that her son has been &quot;labeled&quot;---but she can see how unique <br/>\nand brilliant he is. He came home one day last week and proudly told his mom <br/>\nthat he was an &quot;outside-the-box thinker&quot;. At least HE doesn&#39;t think he&#39;s <br/>\ndumb!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, she was VERY excited about the whole unschooling philosophy and is <br/>\ncoming over next week to hang with us. She&#39;ll be reading the boards, and I&#39;m <br/>\ninviting her to unschoolingdotcomedy ( I hope it&#39;s a GOOD place for a while! &lt;<br/>\nG&gt;). And she&#39;ll be at the conference with her husband and boys.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just GIDDY! And wanted to share. Most unschooling conversations with <br/>\n&quot;non-believers&quot; don&#39;t turn out this well, and I&#39;m thrilled!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly, dancing a jig this afternoon!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13190,"nextTopicId":8295}}
