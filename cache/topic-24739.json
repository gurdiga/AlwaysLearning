I would find it<br/>\nfacinating to swap, but I would never leave my kids with someone who I did<br/>\nnot know for a week or two weeks, esp. someone with completely opposite<br/>\nparenting ideas from mine.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had to choose one of those families to be, I would definitely choose<br/>\nthe homeschool family, although they were portrayed at anti-social with no<br/>\nfriends on the one hand, (the dd had her first ever friend over for dinner)<br/>\nbut in another scene at the beginning they had a party with some of their<br/>\nreenactment friends and showed them around a lot of people.

Not just homeschooling, but SCA, it seemed.   <br/>\nMarty and Holly called me to look. Marty said &quot;Re-enactors.&quot;  I  <br/>\nlooked a minute and said &quot;SCA,&quot; and he asked why I thought so.  Only  <br/>\nthe SCA combines the Renaissance with belly dancing.   But they  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t mention the SCA as far as I heard, and when the dad named the  <br/>\nplaces the kids get out and are with other people, he said hiking and  <br/>\ngaming conventions.  No mention of feasts or tournaments.  Maybe they  <br/>\nwere involved in Renaissance Fairs; that&#39;s possible.  He didn&#39;t  <br/>\nmention those either.  They did play D&D at night (and Marty pointed  <br/>\nout that it was the original D&D book, nothing current or recent).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway...<br/>\nThey traded that mom (who was portrayed as somewhat of a nut, and I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t know how much editing or coaching goes on to edge them nutty- <br/>\nward) with a mom who was a teacher and had a second job in a  <br/>\nrestaurant (doing books and cooking, apparently; not cooking books, I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t think &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch embarrassment ensued, and the school-focussed family ended up  <br/>\nadapting more from the homeschooling family than the other way  <br/>\naround.  The mom cut down on her hours, quit her second job or  <br/>\nsomething, and the family was spending time together which the kids  <br/>\nseemed happy about.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty was saying &quot;We should be on this show!&quot;   Holly and I were  <br/>\nsaying &quot;NO, not possible.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile they were sure they could handle some other mom&#39;s rules for a  <br/>\nweek, I wasn&#39;t sure I could handle some other family&#39;s... FAMILY for  <br/>\na week.   Marty said &quot;They&#39;d probably switch you with some lawyer or  <br/>\nsomething.&quot;   Yeah, that&#39;s not too bad, but if I had to go to a job  <br/>\nwhere I had to dress up, wear heels, MAKE-UP...  Yuck. &lt;g&gt;   Marty  <br/>\nsaid I could really change some people&#39;s lives doing that switch.   <br/>\nUh...  Yeah, but maybe not.  They could probably just edit me to look  <br/>\nnutty, old, crazy...   And the mom who traded with us would have to  <br/>\ngo online every day and talk to people about unschooling.  (Oh!  That  <br/>\nwould be fun for you all to discuss with her what my kids were  <br/>\naccustomed to, and to remind her to be quiet until Holly wakes up  <br/>\nnaturally. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor years and YEARS we had no monday-through-friday schedule, except  <br/>\nthat Keith usually worked then and not on weekends, but for most of  <br/>\nfour years, Keith worked in Minnesota, not from home.  He&#39;d be home  <br/>\nten days a month, and those were fun days, and the rest were fun,  <br/>\nunscheduled days too.   Since December, though, both Kirby and Marty  <br/>\nhave worked exactly and precisely Monday through Friday, and not on  <br/>\nweekends.  WEIRD.  So now they can tell weekends from weekdays for  <br/>\nthe first time ever, and I can too.  It&#39;s just me and Holly mid-days,  <br/>\nand Holly&#39;s usually asleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the schooly family only stayed home from school one day, and  <br/>\non that one day the mom was trying to get the teenaged boy to make  <br/>\nsome boots for his costume (she had them wearing Renaissance  <br/>\ncostumes).  That made sense to me, because their costumes came from a  <br/>\ncostume shop, and he was wearing goofy jester&#39;s shoes, and I wouldn&#39;t  <br/>\nblame  him for not wanting to wear them.  So it seemed she was  <br/>\nhelping him make some better shoes, but that made the dad mad because  <br/>\nit wasn&#39;t academic.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeird.  Weird ideas, weird that the producers so sadistically find  <br/>\nfamilies SO different.  I hope the participants make good money doing  <br/>\nthat.  It seems like a dangerous shake-down of peaceful situations to  <br/>\nme.  And it&#39;s not really WIFEswap, it&#39;s mom-swap.  The husband  <br/>\nprobably hardly ever sees the visiting mom and where does she sleep?   <br/>\nWhere does he sleep?
