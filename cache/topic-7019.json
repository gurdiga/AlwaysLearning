Also, when the water tables get low it is<br/>\nmore difficult to get the water into the human<br/>\nconsumption systems....and clean.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a blessing that most of us can safely drink water<br/>\nfrom the tap  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are in Fl, too, only 30 miles north of you, but a<br/>\nslightly different aquifir.
