You could make <br/>\na game of watching shows and trying to figure out what&#39;s going on.  (My <br/>\ngrandfather and I used to watch movies with the sound turned off and try to <br/>\nguess.  Sometimes it was hilarious.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOr maybe there&#39;s someone nearby who speaks Spanish well and is lonely.  You <br/>\ncould invite that person to come for coffee and Spanish conversation once a <br/>\nweek.  If you have enough Spanish to understand and be understood (even <br/>\njust barely), you and the person could have a conversation without putting <br/>\nyour son on the spot.  He could just listen, joining in only if he felt <br/>\ncomfortable.<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one can make you feel inferior without your consent.<br/>\nEleanor Roosevelt<br/>\n*********************************************<br/>\nTia Leschke<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\nOn Vancouver Island</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] spanish programs?","postDate":"1014139603","msgId":4978,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4Ny4zOTU0NmMxLjI5YTNlNGQzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4970,"nextInTopic":4983,"prevInTime":4977,"nextInTime":4979,"topicId":4964,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/18/02 10:54:51 PM, mariettashirk@hotmail.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1120174847\">In a message dated 2/18/02 10:54:51 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mariettashirk@...\">mariettashirk@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Can anyone suggest a good way for my son to pick up Spanish?
