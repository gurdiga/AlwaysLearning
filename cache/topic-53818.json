At certain points in the show I would have a hard<br/>\ntime watching.  I loved the conversations that came from watching that show<br/>\nthough.  Even dh, Mark, if he was home would <br/>\nwatch with us.<br/>\n <br/>\nRecently I happened to catch a little bit of this show here in the UK called<br/>\noutnumbered.  This bit had so many funny lol moments (atm I don&#39;t know which<br/>\none that was).  Since then I&#39;ve watched a <br/>\ncouple of the shows.  I think this show could possibly be the best parenting<br/>\nshow out there at the moment.  It&#39;s so obvious these traditional parents are<br/>\ntrying so very hard at being the best parents <br/>\nthey can with the information they have.  The dad seems to be especially<br/>\nbumbling and out of his depth that even though his parenting can make ya<br/>\ncringe and maybe go &#39;oh no! &#39; I think one can&#39;t <br/>\nhelp but feel for him and want to give him a big ol&#39; hug sometimes.  It&#39;s<br/>\nmade very obvious to the viewer how smart the *children* are and not the<br/>\nparents!  At least to me, more traditional parents <br/>\npossibly would see it differently I suppose.  At times I do find the<br/>\nparenting style a little hard to watch and take a break but so far I keep<br/>\ncoming back!  <br/>\n <br/>\nI looked on wiki and there&#39;s been an American pilot made of the show.  In in<br/>\nthe UK version there is plenty of improvisation from the children.  I didn&#39;t<br/>\nknow that before and so like the show that little <br/>\nmore now. <br/>\n <br/>\nHere&#39;s the first part and episode of the show.  There&#39;s not a ton lol<br/>\nmoments with this one but imo the bit starting at 2:39 totally is.  <br/>\n <br/>\nOUTNUMBERED S01 E01 part 1 <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fBBppLsu2s\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fBBppLsu2s</a><br/>\n <br/>\nIf you check it out I hope you like it too,<br/>\nJoy K<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://geo.yahoo.com/serv?s=97359714/grpId=4410250/grpspId=1705542111/msgId\">http://geo.yahoo.com/serv?s=97359714/grpId=4410250/grpspId=1705542111/msgId</a><br/>\n=53857/stime=1273121293/nc1=1/nc2=2/nc3=3&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[{"url":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/5fBBppLsu2s?wmode=opaque","type":"VIDEO"}]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Parenting styles viaTV Re: Good enough unschooling parent","postDate":"1273121291","msgId":53857,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRCRTI0QTBCLjIwNzAxMDdAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEQzNDJBREE5LTI5RDAtNDU4NS1BNTNELUJGMjU0NDBGRkQ2NkBzdXBlbm4uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhyczJoNSt1cmhoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NEJFMjFEOTYuMzA5MDAwN0BlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0PiA8RDM0MkFEQTktMjlEMC00NTg1LUE1M0QtQkYyNTQ0MEZGRDY2QHN1cGVubi5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":53856,"nextInTopic":53865,"prevInTime":53856,"nextInTime":53858,"topicId":53818,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I don&#39;t watch shows or movies with kids being kidnapped, or with graphic rape scenes, or with people being publicly humiliated, or where the humor is mostly based on people who supposedly love each other making nasty jokes at each other&#39;s expense. I just don&#39;t enjoy any of those things. I actually have very little time to watch TV--maybe an hour a day, often less. I&#39;m actually that rare person who wishes she had time to watch _more_ TV than I do. So I cut shows out of the rotation pretty ruthlessly.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if I had older kids (my oldest is just about to turn 9), and they were really into any of those shows... Well, I&#39;ve watched Dragonball Z and more hours of Dora the Explorer than I can count (I find Dora the Explorer--the show, not the little animated person--very annoying), so I&#39;d probably dive in with these shows too. My kids and I already talk about how my oldest son and I really don&#39;t like, say, the graphic cadavers in NCIS, but Carl, who just turned six, is fascinated by them (he likes anatomy books, too). If the show is on, Carl tells me and Eric when we can stop covering our eyes. So I think if there was someone in the house who was finding Parenthood entertaining or interesting, or even annoying in a thought-provoking instead of (to me) &quot;Oh, more of this tired old crap&quot; way,  we&#39;d be watching it and talking about it, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu, mom to Eric, 8; Carl, 6; Yehva, 2.5<br/>\ntapeflags.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Parenting styles viaTV Re: Good enough unschooling parent","postDate":"1273112643","msgId":53849,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVFRUE5QzVFLUFDQjEtNDE0RS04MEY3LTkxNTUxRkNGMjNGNUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDRCRTIxRDk2LjMwOTAwMDdAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGhyczJoNSt1cmhoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NEJFMjFEOTYuMzA5MDAwN0BlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":53845,"nextInTopic":53852,"prevInTime":53848,"nextInTime":53850,"topicId":53818,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-But the writing is all about how parents and children might relate - and I really do find that interesting to watch and think about and talk about with my","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1131248102\">-=-But the writing is all about how parents and children might relate  <br/>\n- and<br/>\nI really do find that interesting to watch and think about and talk<br/>\nabout with my daughter.
