We worked things out amongst ourselves.This was my personal experience. My mother was always available if I needed help figuring things out.&nbsp; <br><br>The purpose of my original post was to share something that I found beautiful and liberating.

Because my parents and the kids in my neighborhood prized certain kinds of skills and experiences, I learned to devalue the things I cared about in favor of what was acceptable.

He still is, but as a little kid he was kind of a prodigy. He was fast and agile and overwhelmingly capable at physical tasks. It was hard to argue with him about safety because when he said &quot;no, I won&#39;t get hurt&quot; he was almost certainly right - and in a moment, he&#39;d prove it. But at the same time, he didn&#39;t Want a &quot;watch from a distance&quot; parent - he wanted someone to play With him. When he was left to his own devices, he broke things - sometimes deliberately - and hurt people - sometimes deliberately - in order to get more of the attention and engagement he craved. He couldn&#39;t really be left to work things out with other kids because he was big and strong and capable and not just &quot;for his age&quot; &nbsp;- so he quickly learned that violence was a Fantastic solution. He could hurt other kids and get his way And then get lots and lots of attention from adults: Score.&nbsp;<br><br>So I re-learned a lot of my kid-in-the-woods skills - I climbed trees with him and ran around with him. I couldn&#39;t do all the things he could do, but I got involved as much as I could and I (and his other parents) looked hard for other people to hang out with him. I didn&#39;t hover, I played with him, I was his buddy and helped other people be his buddies whenever possible. There weren&#39;t many at first - a five year old who can hurt an adult by running up and hugging you is a daunting playmate!&nbsp;<br><br>My daughter is also very physical and energetic, but not the prodigy Ray was - and she&#39;s much, much more... focused than Ray. I don&#39;t know a good way to put that. When she&#39;s busy with her own internal world, she has a hard time emerging to notice what&#39;s going on with the people around her. She&#39;s left other kids feeling snubbed in the past, because while she likes them, she sometimes shuts them out because they aren&#39;t nearly as important as other things. She&#39;s incredibly independent when she feels like it - the first time I went to an unschooling conference she (age 4) left me to run back to our cabin, with me trailing along in a panic, unable to catch up and hoping she knew where she was going. Then she refused to come out of our room for the rest of the day in favor of paper-cutting. The next evening she went on a fabulous night-time adventure with another girl in our cabin and that girl&#39;s dad. And yet we&#39;ve also been to conferences where she never left the room or spoke to anyone but me. She can spend an entire day socializing... or an entire day editing a drawing. She regularly spends hours at a time on the trampoline, telling stories to herself. She&#39;s very physical and active, but terrified to ride a bike, or walk into a store by herself, or use the stove (she&#39;s 12 now). I don&#39;t know if she&#39;d go to an adventure playground - she might refuse to have anything to do with it. Or she might go with a group of friends, the way she once decided to go play laser tag dressed in a fancy party dress.<br><br>Trying to squeeze me into either the category of &quot;helicopter&quot; or &quot;from a distance&quot; doesn&#39;t work any better with Morgan that it did with Ray. Neither makes sense in the context of who she is and what she needs. Sometimes she needs me to do things for her, or hold her hand every step of the way. Other times, she&#39;ll call if she needs anything, don&#39;t wait up mom.&nbsp;</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":284087656,"authorName":"","from":"&lt;semajrak@...&gt;","profile":"semajrak","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Risky Play","postDate":"1395515953","msgId":73929,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGxna21vcisxcmc4bjhkQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGxnaTk3aisxaDcyODNzQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGxnaTk3aisxaDcyODNzQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":73928,"nextInTopic":73930,"prevInTime":73928,"nextInTime":73930,"topicId":73926,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

While I *think* the latter is best, I, often times, *feel* the need to be a helicopter parent. I understand that this habit is solely fear-based and I am now choosing to move away from fearful thinking and reacting. <br><br>I think back to my childhood and reminisce about all of the free time I had riding my bike wherever I wanted, playing in the woods, building forts and climbing trees, making decisions and learning from them.&nbsp; Some were painful or scary, some were empowering.&nbsp; I learned what worked, how to interact within a group of kids, what would get me in trouble and how to befriend people. Nobody was watching me and I&#39;m fine. Never did one of my parents step in and ask other kids to play with me! I see this all the time at the park. Why is this generation obsessed with safety and &quot;fairness&quot; when it comes to our kids?&nbsp; Until recently, I have been extremely safety-conscious (paranoid?) and trust me, it&#39;s exhausting! Wanting the best for my child is an extremely powerful catalyst for change.&nbsp; Along with that, being able to live with more peace and trust and joy.<br><br>My husband emailed me a link to this video about adventure playgrounds that are gaining popularity in the UK. These look like wonderful places, that just months ago, I wouldn&#39;t have considered letting my 8 yr. old son even go near! These playgrounds encourage the &quot;risky play&quot; that is so frowned upon these days. At first, it might look like a junkyard of sorts, but think back to your childhood and see it through your 8 yr. old eyes; its beautiful!&nbsp; These video clips are from a documentary called The Land (which is the name of an adventure playground in Wales). I&#39;m not sure when it is coming out, but I can&#39;t wait to see the whole thing. I just hope the idea catches on in the USA! <br><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://vimeo.com/89009798\">http://vimeo.com/89009798</a><br><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://playfreemovie.com/trailer/\">http://playfreemovie.com/trailer/</a><br><br>Mel</div>","specialLinks":[{"url":"http://player.vimeo.com/video/89009798","type":"VIDEO"}]}],"prevTopicId":73938,"nextTopicId":73942}}
