A game is something","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-120550249\">Responding to the earlier post with a game question made me think about<br/>\nhow wonderful it is to give games for Christmas and the holidays.  A<br/>\ngame is something that can be shared and played by many people, bringing<br/>\nfamilies and friends together for quality time.  I thought I would make<br/>\na few posts over the next week or so and introduce some of the lesser<br/>\nknown, but still very popular games that make great gifts for anybody.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of you may have already heard of or even played the board game<br/>\nTICKET TO RIDE.  Produced by Days of Wonder, Ticket to Ride is a very<br/>\nhigh-quality and all around appealing game, both visually and<br/>\nthematically.  See the game here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/9209\">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/9209</a><br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/9209\">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/9209</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTicket to Ride - 2-5 players, ages 8 and up.  Play time 45 min-1 hour.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe board is a map of the United States, and each player receives a<br/>\nstash of colored plastic trains.  The goal is to earn the most points by<br/>\ncompleting Destination Tickets (designated routes from one point to<br/>\nanother).  Each destination ticket has a point value. Complete multiple<br/>\ndestination tickets for more points, but have any incomplete tickets<br/>\nwhen the game ends and those points are deducted.  Destination Tickets<br/>\nare given out at the beginning of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a player&#39;s turn they can choose to do ONE of 3 things:<br/>\n1) Draw 2 cards - either from the face down draw deck, or from a layout<br/>\nof 5 face up cards (replenshed when drawn).  The cards can be any color.<br/>\n2) Play a meld of same colored cards to claim a route.  A route is from<br/>\none city to another.  For each colored section of a route, the player<br/>\nmust play one matching colored card.  They place one of their trains on<br/>\neach of the colored sections.<br/>\n3) Draw 3 destinations tickets, and must choose to keep at least one.<br/>\n<br/>\nPoints are earned for each route that is claimed by a player, depending<br/>\non the length of the route, and by completing destination tickets.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game ends when one player runs out of their colored trains.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that is the bare bones of it!  Every person I have introduced this<br/>\ngame to has loved it.  In gaming lingo, this game is considered a<br/>\n&quot;gateway&quot; game, meaning it&#39;s a step up from the more usual and common<br/>\ngames (Monopoly, etc) and introduces people to the lesser known<br/>\nEuro-style games.  (Definition of Eurogame:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sodaklady.wordpress.com/what-is-a-euro-game/\">http://sodaklady.wordpress.com/what-is-a-euro-game/</a><br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sodaklady.wordpress.com/what-is-a-euro-game/\">http://sodaklady.wordpress.com/what-is-a-euro-game/</a>&gt; )<br/>\n<br/>\nPriced a little higher than games you find at the local stores and only<br/>\nobtainable through specialty stores or online retailers, this game is<br/>\nworth every penny.   I haven&#39;t even seen my copy for some time now<br/>\nbecause it&#39;s always being borrowed by friends or family members.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll post another game introduction in a couple of days, and will focus<br/>\non something a little more budget-friendly.<br/>\n<br/>\nHAPPY GAMING!<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40703,"nextTopicId":40648}}
