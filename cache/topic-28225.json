I experience number patterns and combinations as 3 dimensional sculptures.  <br/>\nThey have different &quot;feelings&quot;.  Some are all angles and points.  Others are rounded or <br/>\nspiral - some even bulbous.  I have always enjoyed playing with numbers in my head <br/>\nfinding how they relate in different combinations and how the patterns feel as they form.  I <br/>\nhave always counted things like steps I take or as the water fills a cup - those 2 things are <br/>\nreally different.  The steps are regulated and methodical.  The water is usually cyclical and <br/>\nsynchopated.   I am a dancer and my dances are often physical expressions of number <br/>\ncombinations - not in a counting way though - more as complex combinations and <br/>\npatterns.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the other part of the story:  I was a miserable failure with &quot;math&quot; in school!  In the <br/>\n3rd grade I still loved #&#39;s until we had to learn the times tables by a specific date.  I <br/>\n&quot;understood&quot; the times table- I had been using #s in that way for a long time.  I couldn&#39;t <br/>\nseem to get them to pop into my head at random the way they wanted us to, however.  <br/>\nThere was no way for me to connect 6x9 to anything real when someone else wanted an <br/>\nanswer.  I needed it to be poetry or motion. The stress was physical for me and even today <br/>\nI can remember the panic feeling of &quot;I&#39;m never going to pull this out of thin air before the <br/>\ntime is up!&quot;  When the date to have them memorized came the class was &quot;rewarded&quot; with <br/>\nan ice cream party while I sat in the library as the only kid who didn&#39;t know my <br/>\nmultiplication tables!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Dad has a PhD in math and science education.  He sees #s as brilliant possiblity.  I saw <br/>\nmyself as his daughter the math failure.  Even he, the most patient and loving man in the <br/>\nworld, seemed not to be able to understand how I would just become paralyzed by my <br/>\nbasic high school algebra book open before me.  I loved the beauty and simplicity of <br/>\ngeometry.  There was something I could feast my eyes on! - but expressing it all in <br/>\nmathmatical formulas on paper brought back that physical stress from 3rd grade.  I truly <br/>\nunderstood geometry - in my bones- if you had asked me to dance it I could have done so  <br/>\nwith such depth it would have blown your mind,  but that wouldn&#39;t have worked in high <br/>\nschool or on the SAT! I got a C in geometry and still consider that my big school math <br/>\nsuccess.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn spite of my school math misery I still love the possibilities of #s and the ways they go <br/>\ntogether.  I still dance them.  My Dh and DS can get positively fired up and giddy over a <br/>\ngood math puzzler in ways I don&#39;t get at all!  Some people don&#39;t &quot;get &quot; absract art. Some <br/>\ndon&#39;t &quot;get&quot; the poetry of baseball.  There is no &quot;failure&quot; there - it&#39;s just not their thing.  The <br/>\nbeauty or fun of math just may not be your thing. The way I see it as long as you don&#39;t <br/>\ndismiss that it can be magical for someone else just because it isn&#39;t for you than there is <br/>\nno harm. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlyse</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":166322738,"authorName":"Nancy Wooton","from":"Nancy Wooton &lt;nancywooton@...&gt;","profile":"ikonstitcher","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] LD & what&#39;s normal","postDate":"1174614120","msgId":28272,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc1ZDBiODZkYjM4YzBhNzYxNDg0M2Y4ZjE3NjRkNWE4QGNveC5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDkyMzczMEU5LTgwODMtNDI4QS05MDY2LTA1QzlGRTRGNUExMEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"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"},"prevInTopic":28271,"nextInTopic":28275,"prevInTime":28271,"nextInTime":28273,"topicId":28225,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I got physical shivers a couple of times from  <br/>\nMaria&#39;s songs (both singers did it for me/to me).  I cried.

Then we thought we&#39;d teach him one page of a  <br/>\nmadrigal we&#39;re going to teach a group tomorrow night.  He learned two  <br/>\npages of the bass part super fast, and remembered it four days  <br/>\nlater.  That was exciting, to see someone learn something so quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] LD & what&#39;s normal","postDate":"1174608763","msgId":28268,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkyMzczMEU5LTgwODMtNDI4QS05MDY2LTA1QzlGRTRGNUExMEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhlZWMyYTAwOWJmYTVlZWUxZTBhZDQ5NThmNTllMDJiQGNveC5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHT0VORkZNQUIuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4gPDNhMWQ2OGYzMTcyMTljNWEwNDA2ODA2OWJlYTcyODY0QGNveC5uZXQ+IDw1MDBBMTFBQS05NDg5LTRBM0MtQTdEQS01OTNCN0NENkM2NDJAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4gPDlhMmJjYjQyZTY2YWUwMzE4MDgyMWUyODE0YzQ2Y2M5QGNveC5uZXQ+IDxGRjNGOUNBRS05N0JGLTRCMTYtOEUwMS1DODA0MzcyNUNCREZAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4gPDlFRTRDOTcyLTMyRDMtNDE4OS05NzYxLUQxRUMyRDU3RDEyNEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0PiA8OGVlYzJhMDA5YmZhNWVlZTFlMGFkNDk1OGY1OWUwMmJAY294Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":28265,"nextInTopic":28269,"prevInTime":28267,"nextInTime":28269,"topicId":28225,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Brain researchers/educational psychologists know a  <br/>\nlot, but almost none of it gets utilized in schools because, of  <br/>\ncourse, it isn&#39;t easy, in a classroom environment, to break away from  <br/>\na predetermined one-size-fits-all curriculum and it isn&#39;t easy to  <br/>\njust stop grading children and stop testing and stop trying to  <br/>\nmanipulate them into learning what, how, and when, all based on the  <br/>\nopinions of some appointed committee of adults who don&#39;t even know  <br/>\nthe child and have little to no awareness of the reality of the  <br/>\nchild&#39;s life.<br/>\n<br/>\nMath facility is key to many careers - most high-paying careers  <br/>\nrequire significant math skills. Math grades are used as a &quot;filter&quot; -  <br/>\nit reduces the supply of &quot;qualified&quot; new entrants to lucrative fields  <br/>\nand thereby keeps those fields lucrative. Another way to put it: it  <br/>\nkeeps the riffraff out.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m not saying that the math teachers have this in mind when they  <br/>\nengage in teaching methods that systematically destroy young  <br/>\nchildren&#39;s early love of math and then go on to create significant  <br/>\nand often debilitating math anxiety in most older kids and teens.  <br/>\nThey&#39;re usually doing what they believe is right for the kids. EVEN  <br/>\nthough most elementary school teachers THEMSELVES have significant  <br/>\nmath anxiety, they usually blame the teaching methods used on them  <br/>\nand they teach differently in response. What they don&#39;t see is that  <br/>\nthe aspect of their teaching approach that causes the most problems  <br/>\nis still the same - introduction of too much material, too soon, with  <br/>\ntoo much formal notation and abstract thinking required before the  <br/>\nchild has had enough chance to &quot;play around&quot; with materials, become  <br/>\nmotivated to understand mathematical relationships, grasp the purpose  <br/>\nof math techniques, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the U.S., at least, it is like we&#39;re all constantly swimming in an  <br/>\nocean of negative influences around math. Kids absorb this and even  <br/>\nthose lucky kids who aren&#39;t schooled (at home or at school) often  <br/>\npick up on their parents&#39; negative feelings about math. I really  <br/>\nencourage parents of young children to start now to change their OWN  <br/>\nrelationship with math - start by snuggling up with your little ones  <br/>\nand reading math-related stories - don&#39;t shy away from them, revel in  <br/>\nthem, instead. There are wonderful math-related picture books - just  <br/>\nstart with those and then move on to having fun together in natural  <br/>\nways, as things come up. I&#39;m pretty convinced that most of us have a  <br/>\ncertain amount of handicap to overcome in this area and so it is  <br/>\nworth it to make a conscious effort to compensate for any tendency we  <br/>\nmay have to avoid math. If this sounds to people like it goes against  <br/>\nunschooling principles - (like it is dividing the world into  <br/>\nartificial subjects or it is overly &quot;parent-initiated&quot;) then I think  <br/>\nyou should reconsider. Think of other phobias you might have that you  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t want to pass along to your child. If you&#39;re terrified of  <br/>\nwater, scared of swimming, then you can either cringe and gasp and  <br/>\ngrab your child back every time he gets near water, and pretty soon  <br/>\nyour child will be afraid of water, too, or you can find ways to give  <br/>\nyour child enjoyable and relaxed exposure to water and swimming and  <br/>\nyou can, for your child&#39;s sake, hide your own fear or at least make  <br/>\nit clear that your child doesn&#39;t need to share it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":166322738,"authorName":"Nancy Wooton","from":"Nancy Wooton &lt;nancywooton@...&gt;","profile":"ikonstitcher","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] LD & what&#39;s normal","postDate":"1174594533","msgId":28260,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdhNzdiYjUzOTZlZTQ1N2YxM2JhMDIyOTQ2NWU3NTNiQGNveC5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHS0VPQ0ZNQUIuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHS0VPQ0ZNQUIuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":28258,"nextInTopic":28261,"prevInTime":28259,"nextInTime":28261,"topicId":28225,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

You didn&#39;t recognize (diagnose) these <br/>\nthings all on your own.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would define seriously as not life-threatening; chronic, perhaps, but <br/>\nnot critical.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Outside of that, if you live life with what brings joy to you and your<br/>\n&gt; children, what difference does the differences between you matter?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It wasn&#39;t until we connected with schoolers that the first label of <br/>\n&gt; &quot;autism&quot;<br/>\n&gt; was mentioned in regards to ds. How important was it for this <br/>\n&gt; unschooling<br/>\n&gt; parent to have that information from &quot;experts&quot;? Eh. It helped some <br/>\n&gt; with my<br/>\n&gt; own reading here and there, but ultimately, my son was who he was and I<br/>\n&gt; could only know who he was by being an attentive parent. I could see <br/>\n&gt; what<br/>\n&gt; gave him joy and what didn&#39;t. I could see what helped him be <br/>\n&gt; successful and<br/>\n&gt; what didn&#39;t. I was pretty shocked to read the recommendations by the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;experts&quot;...have a rigid schedule, make the child do things so that <br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; learn to do them, etc. I do believe ds has had a much more fulfilling <br/>\n&gt; life<br/>\n&gt; unschooling than any of that mumbo jumbo would have brought.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thank you, that&#39;s helpful.  I&#39;ve seen families really struggling to do <br/>\nwhat they&#39;ve been told is necessary, who can&#39;t imagine giving it all up <br/>\nbecause they don&#39;t want to harm their child.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I think, though, that<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; parents of special needs kids don&#39;t have that luxury; they are <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; immersed<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; in a world focused on the future.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s their choice and they don&#39;t have to be. It is perfectly <br/>\n&gt; possible to<br/>\n&gt; live joyfully in this moment day after day with kids who have different<br/>\n&gt; issues. It is not mandated that anyone be immersed in a world focused <br/>\n&gt; on the<br/>\n&gt; future.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I hear you, but boy, does that go against the &quot;norm&quot;!!  ;-)  I used to <br/>\nhave a quote pinned to my bulletin board:  We crucify ourselves between <br/>\ntwo thieves: Regret for the past, and fear of the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; But how else would someone know a child&#39;s brain is not functioning or<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; developing &quot;normally,&quot; except by observing what the child does?&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Again, what is normal and why is it important to designate?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A old person suddenly has slurred speech.  Do we say, oh, that&#39;s <br/>\nnormal, that&#39;s his unique way of being, or do we suspect he&#39;s having a <br/>\nstroke and call 911?  Immediate intervention can prevent further <br/>\ndamage, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there no situations when a child&#39;s behavior might be a clue that <br/>\nintervention of some kind is needed?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; My daughter didn&#39;t use the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; potty until she was almost four. *I* finally had had it -- two kids <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; in<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; diapers, one nearly old enough to change the other, was just too much<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; (we had no washer or dryer, either). I stepped in and *trained* her&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It is impossible to know what would have happened if you continued to <br/>\n&gt; let<br/>\n&gt; her choose.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I could have chosen to stop changing her, I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But I have not met anyone whose child went too much over 5 in<br/>\n&gt; diapers. Does it matter if it is 5 or 3 or 2 when a child uses the <br/>\n&gt; toilet?<br/>\n&gt; The whole &quot;potty-trained by 3&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>3?  I was being ragged about it when she was 2.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; is again, someone&#39;s opinion, with limited<br/>\n&gt; information (doesn&#39;t know every individual child in the world). It is<br/>\n&gt; understood that you made this decision because of your financial <br/>\n&gt; situation,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, I was tired of the guilt from killing so many trees.  I never used <br/>\na cloth diaper on either baby.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but that doesn&#39;t mean that it was the best thing for your child.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Except it was.  She was *thrilled* to have that mastery, and never once <br/>\nwet her pants.  I think she didn&#39;t want to &quot;grow up&quot; in that way, while <br/>\nlittle brother was still getting changed.  Without me saying so, she <br/>\nbegan to call herself a big girl, announcing she was no longer a baby.  <br/>\n(Now that I think about it, it could be a helpful grandma had made that <br/>\ndistinction while trying to get her to use the potty at her <br/>\nhouse...hmmm.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; At the same time, some kids learn from immediate reinforcement, <br/>\n&gt; particularly<br/>\n&gt; kids with neurological issues,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Okay -- so there ARE situations where some kind of intervention is <br/>\nneeded?  Something a physical therapist or other &quot;expert&quot; might <br/>\nrecommend?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and when you are talking about something that<br/>\n&gt; will be very useful in life, like using a bathroom, this kind of <br/>\n&gt; approach<br/>\n&gt; may be best.

I was really shocked when <br/>\nI got my first glasses and things were suddenly in focus.  Becoming <br/>\nnearsighted was gradual.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; So - unschooling is a big responsibility in the sense that we can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; count on outside experts (using the term &quot;expert&quot; very loosely) to<br/>\n&gt; notice such things for us.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; About the math - I am firmly and absolutely and totally completely<br/>\n&gt; (strong enough words?) convinced that nearly all math &quot;problems&quot; -<br/>\n&gt; what is called dyscalculia or any other kinds of math-related<br/>\n&gt; learning problems, are entirely due to schooling - whether schooling<br/>\n&gt; at school or schooling at home - it is the teaching methods that<br/>\n&gt; create it. I can&#39;t prove it, but I&#39;ve worked with hundreds, actually<br/>\n&gt; thousands, of high school and college students and adults and I truly<br/>\n&gt; have no doubt at all about the cause of most people&#39;s math problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So why don&#39;t the schools do something about it?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll answer that -- politics.  There was a move years ago in my area to <br/>\nintroduce new math teaching methods (sorry I don&#39;t know what they were, <br/>\nbut there was some organization of math teachers behind it); it was <br/>\noverridden by the Back to Basics types who thought drilling and more <br/>\ndrilling was the way to go, and they had more power.  They also had the <br/>\ntest scores to &quot;prove&quot; it.  You&#39;ve got one camp pushing one method, <br/>\nanother something else, everyone on the school boards remembering the <br/>\nNew Math debacle (or at least the Tom Lehrer song ridiculing it) and, <br/>\nnot wanting to repeat that...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; While it is true that most people aren&#39;t born to be math geniuses,<br/>\n&gt; they are pretty much all born with the ability to do all arithmetic<br/>\n&gt; and mathematics up to and including calculus.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I thought mathematics and arithmetic weren&#39;t the same thing?  That <br/>\npeople get screwed up because arithmetic is taught too early, bad <br/>\nfeelings get associated with it, and any possibility of doing well in <br/>\nmathematics is ruined.  I could certainly be wrong, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Most people aren&#39;t born<br/>\n&gt; to be musical geniuses, either, and yet most people have the ability<br/>\n&gt; to learn to sing or play piano, if they have the interest in doing<br/>\n&gt; so. Same with math. The difference is that most kids are not forced<br/>\n&gt; to &quot;do music&quot; every day for most of their childhood years - taught<br/>\n&gt; music using horribly ridiculous teaching methods that introduce<br/>\n&gt; abstract notation before the child&#39;s brain is capable of<br/>\n&gt; understanding it,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>One thing that really messed me up was that third grade was the year we <br/>\nhad to learn cursive writing, after starting with printing.  At the <br/>\nsame time, we started times tables and division.  I don&#39;t think my <br/>\nbrain could cope with all the new symbols.  (I was half a year younger <br/>\nthan my class, too, and much smaller.  That didn&#39;t help.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve read Frank Smith&#39;s &quot;The Glass Wall: Why Mathematics Can Seem <br/>\nDifficult,&quot; btw; what I remember of it is that verbal language and math <br/>\nlanguage don&#39;t translate well.  One of the other things about math <br/>\neducation that boggled my mind was when the symbols started changing -- <br/>\nX for times was replaced by a dot, then by a number next to a <br/>\nparenthesis, then X started meaning &quot;fill in the blank&quot; instead of <br/>\ntimes...  (Hey, I&#39;ve even read &quot;Overcoming Math Anxiety&quot; &lt;ggg&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and most kids aren&#39;t shamed and made to feel stupid<br/>\n&gt; about music on an almost-daily basis.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I had a piano teacher who did that.  Guess how?  By writing COUNT! in <br/>\ninch-high letters across the first page of my practice book.  I still <br/>\ncan&#39;t count time, but I can tap it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Oh yeah, and we don&#39;t expect<br/>\n&gt; kids to learn music without actually being exposed to any real music.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, what&#39;s &quot;real math&quot; then?  It&#39;s not balancing a checkbook, <br/>\ncounting change, figuring percentages in a store, reading a clock?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; No, I don&#39;t think math learning disabilities are inevitable, natural,<br/>\n&gt; or in-born, and I fully believe it when Sudbury claims they&#39;ve never<br/>\n&gt; had a kid with a learning disability.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; However, because so many of us parents DO have math anxieties, we<br/>\n&gt; have a problem in that we can so easily pass those along to our kids.<br/>\n&gt; I think lots of the time our math anxieties are passed along to our<br/>\n&gt; kids because of how we avoid math as well as because of our negative<br/>\n&gt; attitude toward it. So - I encourage unschooling parents to face up<br/>\n&gt; to their math anxieties, for the sake of their kids, and get<br/>\n&gt; themselves over it enough that they can (at least) put on a good show<br/>\n&gt; of loving learning things that have to do with math.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I used to play Set with my kids all the time; bought tesselating <br/>\npuzzles, pattern blocks, tangrams at homeschool conferences, which I <br/>\nthink I played with more than they did.  (I don&#39;t do these any longer <br/>\nbecause the kids started having their own lives &lt;g&gt;)  Alex couldn&#39;t <br/>\npossibly be math anxious and still play Pokemon cards at the level he <br/>\ndoes; a tournament means spending 8 to 10 hours doing mental math.  I <br/>\nnever tried to teach him Pokemon, of course ;-)  He&#39;s never tried to <br/>\nteach me, either!<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy  (sorry to be so angsty :-)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244823738,"authorName":"Chris","from":"&quot;Chris&quot; &lt;spunkyhorsey@...&gt;","profile":"spunkyhorsey","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: LD & what&#39;s normal","postDate":"1174585013","msgId":28257,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGV0dWVybCthbHZnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEUwNEY3RTFELTA0MTYtNEQwRS04QzcyLTI2OUEzNTZDQ0YwREBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":28256,"nextInTopic":28258,"prevInTime":28256,"nextInTime":28258,"topicId":28225,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Ds was born with a<br/>\nsevere congenital heart defect that has required three open-heart surgeries<br/>\nover 15 years, and the last surgery caused him to bleed out and lose his<br/>\nlife for a bit. He sustained long-term neurological damage that he lives<br/>\nwith daily. In all of these situations, this unschooling parent recognized<br/>\n&quot;it&quot; that was seriously wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nOutside of that, if you live life with what brings joy to you and your<br/>\nchildren, what difference does the differences between you matter?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t until we connected with schoolers that the first label of &quot;autism&quot;<br/>\nwas mentioned in regards to ds. How important was it for this unschooling<br/>\nparent to have that information from &quot;experts&quot;? Eh. It helped some with my<br/>\nown reading here and there, but ultimately, my son was who he was and I<br/>\ncould only know who he was by being an attentive parent. I could see what<br/>\ngave him joy and what didn&#39;t. I could see what helped him be successful and<br/>\nwhat didn&#39;t. I was pretty shocked to read the recommendations by the<br/>\n&quot;experts&quot;...have a rigid schedule, make the child do things so that they<br/>\nlearn to do them, etc. I do believe ds has had a much more fulfilling life<br/>\nunschooling than any of that mumbo jumbo would have brought.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I think, though, that<br/>\n&gt;&gt;parents of special needs kids don&#39;t have that luxury; they are immersed<br/>\n&gt;&gt;in a world focused on the future.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s their choice and they don&#39;t have to be. It is perfectly possible to<br/>\nlive joyfully in this moment day after day with kids who have different<br/>\nissues.

Does it matter if it is 5 or 3 or 2 when a child uses the toilet?<br/>\nThe whole &quot;potty-trained by 3&quot; is again, someone&#39;s opinion, with limited<br/>\ninformation (doesn&#39;t know every individual child in the world). It is<br/>\nunderstood that you made this decision because of your financial situation,<br/>\nbut that doesn&#39;t mean that it was the best thing for your child.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, some kids learn from immediate reinforcement, particularly<br/>\nkids with neurological issues, and when you are talking about something that<br/>\nwill be very useful in life, like using a bathroom, this kind of approach<br/>\nmay be best. But it would be VERY rare it seems, and at a later age rather<br/>\nthan an earlier age.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Where would a parent find such a facilitator, though?

We&#39;ve<br/>\nlearned to ask specifically for what we want (right down to &quot;if you want me<br/>\nto do something differently, please ask me courteously&quot;) and when to let go<br/>\nof people/relationships because they don&#39;t work for us. We have also somehow<br/>\nattracted many very cool and flexible people in our lives and have formed<br/>\nspecial relationships, individually and collectively. I think people have<br/>\nbeen attracted to us as well because of our lifestyle and attitudes.

I can&#39;t prove it, but I&#39;ve worked with hundreds, actually  <br/>\nthousands, of high school and college students and adults and I truly  <br/>\nhave no doubt at all about the cause of most people&#39;s math problems.  <br/>\nWhile it is true that most people aren&#39;t born to be math geniuses,  <br/>\nthey are pretty much all born with the ability to do all arithmetic  <br/>\nand mathematics up to and including calculus. Most people aren&#39;t born  <br/>\nto be musical geniuses, either, and yet most people have the ability  <br/>\nto learn to sing or play piano, if they have the interest in doing  <br/>\nso. Same with math. The difference is that most kids are not forced  <br/>\nto &quot;do music&quot; every day for most of their childhood years - taught  <br/>\nmusic using horribly ridiculous teaching methods that introduce  <br/>\nabstract notation before the child&#39;s brain is capable of  <br/>\nunderstanding it, and most kids aren&#39;t shamed and made to feel stupid  <br/>\nabout music on an almost-daily basis. Oh yeah, and we don&#39;t expect  <br/>\nkids to learn music without actually being exposed to any real music.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, I don&#39;t think math learning disabilities are inevitable, natural,  <br/>\nor in-born, and I fully believe it when Sudbury claims they&#39;ve never  <br/>\nhad a kid with a learning disability.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, because so many of us parents DO have math anxieties, we  <br/>\nhave a problem in that we can so easily pass those along to our kids.  <br/>\nI think lots of the time our math anxieties are passed along to our  <br/>\nkids because of how we avoid math as well as because of our negative  <br/>\nattitude toward it.

Has that changed?  (Not among homeschoolers, <br/>\nbut in general; it seems like parents expect the schools to do even <br/>\nmore, like provide breakfast.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This story of the<br/>\n&gt; smart kid unable to see and thought to be dumb and then being saved by <br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; caring teacher is kind of folklore.

Hmm, maybe that&#39;s where my <br/>\nconcern about labels comes from...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; When Unschoolers remove their children from the school environment, or <br/>\n&gt; never<br/>\n&gt; put them in it in the first place, they do not stop there.

It is not leaving a bad space and replacing it with a void <br/>\n&gt; or<br/>\n&gt; with an equality.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think that would be a tough sell to a lot of these parents.  Some of <br/>\nthese kids aren&#39;t even school age yet, so that&#39;s not the issue.  Again, <br/>\nthough, it was conversations with parents already dealing with special <br/>\nneeds kids that got me thinking about it, but the question was really <br/>\nabout kids already in unschooling families.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;  Like the example below of dyslexia at Sudbury, would I have had<br/>\n&gt;&gt; problems with math if I had never gone to school?  (That, btw, was my<br/>\n&gt;&gt; reason for not doing formal math with my kids at home.  My 19 y.o.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; daughter struggled through a college basic math class last fall and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; passed; she also decided she hates school and refused to enroll for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; another semester.) &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This sounds like a really unfortunate example of passing on math <br/>\n&gt; anxiety all<br/>\n&gt; unwittingly<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>She wasn&#39;t anxious; she just didn&#39;t like school.

Why was she going to <br/>\n&gt; college<br/>\n&gt; in the first place?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Health insurance.  She&#39;s really scared about being without it, and the <br/>\nonly way to stay on dad&#39;s plan was to go to school.  Now, she&#39;s <br/>\napplying to jobs that provide it.  She doesn&#39;t know what she wants to <br/>\ndo yet, and the idea that she could get the general ed. credits out of <br/>\nthe way while living at home and having her insurance covered while she <br/>\ngains some perspective isn&#39;t motivation enough at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  I went to college initially straight from high school,<br/>\n&gt; studying the wrong courses for the wrong reasons, and struggled <br/>\n&gt; eventually<br/>\n&gt; leaving. However after several years I returned to study something I <br/>\n&gt; really<br/>\n&gt; loved and it was a totally different and wonderful experience. Often <br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; admissions criteria for mature age students are different also, and <br/>\n&gt; maybe<br/>\n&gt; some of the irrelevant basic classes will no longer be required.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &gt; That&#39;s certainly possible.  The dyslexics I&#39;ve worked with have <br/>\n&gt; been<br/>\n&gt; so<br/>\n&gt;&gt; severe, though, that it impacted the rest of their lives, not just<br/>\n&gt;&gt; reading.  Difficulty reading was just a diagnostic tool with them.  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; The<br/>\n&gt;&gt; horseback riding helps greatly, as following directions while riding<br/>\n&gt;&gt; provides immediate feedback in a fun way -- if the instructor says<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &quot;turn right, then weave the poles&quot; and you go left and find no <br/>\n&gt;&gt; poles...<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ;-)  These are kids who will never be able to drive, possibly never<br/>\n&gt;&gt; live on their own, etc. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One question that all Unschooling parents are likely to be asking is <br/>\n&gt; &quot;how<br/>\n&gt; can I help my unique child engage in their passions to be able to <br/>\n&gt; blossom to<br/>\n&gt; their fullest potentials and live their happiest life TODAY?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, that gets to the core of my question.  I think, though, that <br/>\nparents of special needs kids don&#39;t have that luxury; they are immersed <br/>\nin a world focused on the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; This question is asked regardless of any intellectual or physical <br/>\n&gt; challenges<br/>\n&gt; the child might have, which is where the idea that the principles <br/>\n&gt; behind<br/>\n&gt; Unschooling are the same regardless of the challenge (Happiness, <br/>\n&gt; Competence,<br/>\n&gt; Success, Contentment, Passion). It is the kind of question that helps <br/>\n&gt; us<br/>\n&gt; remove the idea of useful skills becoming &quot;diagnostic tools&quot; from our<br/>\n&gt; thinking and interactions.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But how else would someone know a child&#39;s brain is not functioning or <br/>\ndeveloping &quot;normally,&quot; except by observing what the child does?  What <br/>\nelse do these kind, supportive, loving unschooling parents, who don&#39;t <br/>\nsend the child to school, observe, if not the child&#39;s skills?  Yes, <br/>\nkids develop on their own timetable -- that&#39;s not to say that <br/>\ndevelopment doesn&#39;t exist, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s another example from my experience:  My daughter didn&#39;t use the <br/>\npotty until she was almost four.  There was nothing physically wrong <br/>\nwith her; she wasn&#39;t interested.  *I* finally had had it -- two kids in <br/>\ndiapers, one nearly old enough to change the other, was just too much <br/>\n(we had no washer or dryer, either).  I stepped in and *trained* her, <br/>\nusing positive reinforcement, in about two hours&#39; time.  I had people <br/>\naround me suggesting, as gently as they could, that maybe she should <br/>\nuse the potty; I really didn&#39;t know how old kids usually were when they <br/>\ndid this, that there was anything &quot;abnormal,&quot; just that I was really <br/>\ntired and going broke buying Huggies ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  I don&#39;t think Unschoolers recommend never helping<br/>\n&gt; your children, or trying to be everything to your child. The key is <br/>\n&gt; finding<br/>\n&gt; the help, including the people, who are willing to accept that the <br/>\n&gt; child is<br/>\n&gt; in charge of their own journey by their parents&#39; wish and design and <br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; their parents&#39; blessing and facilitation. We can choose to empower our<br/>\n&gt; children that way to the fullest extent of their abilities and <br/>\n&gt; developmental<br/>\n&gt; level.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Where would a parent find such a facilitator, though?  It seems many <br/>\nare very set in their (schooly) ways, and would find an unschooling <br/>\napproach tantamount to abuse.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I suppose it is easy for me since my child is, AFAIK, completely <br/>\n&gt; ordinary<br/>\n&gt; from a schooly POV. I suspect that in school she would be in the <br/>\n&gt; middle of<br/>\n&gt; the pack average, with the things that she really adores being only<br/>\n&gt; marginally valued. Or she might be tagged as discipline problem <br/>\n&gt; because she<br/>\n&gt; resents correction fairly forcibly. Or they might decide she can&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; focus,<br/>\n&gt; because she wants to be the person designating the worthiness of any<br/>\n&gt; activity and prioritizing her own time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Perhaps not using the word &quot;dyslexics&quot; as a kind of all encompassing<br/>\n&gt; descriptor, as if that was the primary or only important <br/>\n&gt; characteristic,<br/>\n&gt; would help you move closer to seeing how Unschooling could work <br/>\n&gt; beautifully<br/>\n&gt; for some of these children. I know you are probably just using it as a <br/>\n&gt; kind<br/>\n&gt; of shorthand.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Catch-all for brain-related dysfunctions that effect learning, yes.  I <br/>\nmean, there are other kids I&#39;ve worked with that have much more obvious <br/>\nissues, like Down&#39;s Syndrome, cerebral palsy, etc.  I would imagine any <br/>\nunschooling family with a Down&#39;s child would know it; they wouldn&#39;t be <br/>\nwriting to an email list trying to figure it out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But one of the things that helps in moving towards Unschooling<br/>\n&gt; is examining really closely the words we use habitually or as <br/>\n&gt; shorthand,<br/>\n&gt; looking for the shadow assumptions behind them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Of course.  I&#39;ve been unschooling a long time, but I talk to people who <br/>\ncan&#39;t even begin to think outside the special ed box.  The <br/>\nconversations between parents at the barn always focus on the latest <br/>\ndrug or diagnosis or therapy; it&#39;s sad, but that&#39;s their world.  The <br/>\nfirst thing we hear when they arrive is how the child did at school <br/>\nthat week, or what discipline issue we might need to cope with because <br/>\nthis or that med has been changed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t like hypotheticals much, but in the spirit of analogy ..... I <br/>\n&gt; guess<br/>\n&gt; if, as an Unschooler, Jayn found much of regular life difficult, but <br/>\n&gt; loved<br/>\n&gt; and valued horseback riding, and we found that it was a conduit of the<br/>\n&gt; pleasures of mastery and feelings of competence, we (dh and I) would <br/>\n&gt; do all<br/>\n&gt; we could to ensure that she had the chance to do it all she wanted. <br/>\n&gt; Perhaps<br/>\n&gt; we would find additional other ways for her to interact with horses, <br/>\n&gt; like<br/>\n&gt; being at a stable. It might take sacrifice on our part (since this can <br/>\n&gt; be an<br/>\n&gt; expensive undertaking)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But if she had a diagnosed difficulty, she could ride at a program like <br/>\nours for little or no cost; it&#39;s all volunteer-run :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  but we would prioritize it because Jayn loved it, not<br/>\n&gt; because it was doing her good. We wouldn&#39;t feel the need to use this <br/>\n&gt; passion<br/>\n&gt; as a tool for improving her or addressing perceived (ie by society at <br/>\n&gt; large)<br/>\n&gt; deficits - even though I would expect that other parts of her life <br/>\n&gt; would<br/>\n&gt; become better and fuller as a side effect and that she would feel <br/>\n&gt; better<br/>\n&gt; about herself.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, depending on the child&#39;s problem, riding can work miracles.  I&#39;ve <br/>\nseen kids with CP walk for the first time, and heard an autistic boy <br/>\nsay his first sentence -- to the horse:  &quot;Walk on.&quot;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  if we ignore the fact a child is &quot;behind&quot; in reading, are we <br/>\n&gt; going to<br/>\n&gt; miss the opportunity to intervene for that child?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;The fact&quot; is not a fact at all. It is a subjective judgement, an<br/>\n&gt; evaluation, that is coming from schoolish thinking. This is also <br/>\n&gt; another<br/>\n&gt; example of unexamined colloquialism.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re right.  What about potty training, then?  Should I have <br/>\ncontinued to ignore the fact that my kid wore diapers at three years, <br/>\nten months of age?  The two hours of training resulted in a child who <br/>\nfelt competent and happy about her new skill, though she started out <br/>\nscreaming at me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think it worth examining this &quot;window of opportunity&quot; idea, the idea <br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; outside of a certain window skills aquisition becomes at best very <br/>\n&gt; difficult<br/>\n&gt; if not impossible.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I was thinking of brain development, which the experts identify by <br/>\ntheir skills timetable, not the skills themselves.  If something like <br/>\nrocking a baby is good for baby brain development, will it do any good <br/>\nto rock a fourteen year old if that kid missed out on rocking?  (I <br/>\nknow, I know -- these ideas come and go, and what one generation <br/>\nthought was great turns out to be bull, etc.  Trust me, I&#39;ve had this <br/>\ndiscussion in my head enough times!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I suspect that for most children this concept is one that is very <br/>\n&gt; schooly.<br/>\n&gt; Schools have their schedules - for the &quot;gifted&quot;, for the average, for <br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;learning disabled&quot;. The idea that a child has missed the window could <br/>\n&gt; be<br/>\n&gt; the very one that causes that child to give up on himself and feel bad <br/>\n&gt; about<br/>\n&gt; herself and never try again. I don&#39;t like it. I think it is a barrier <br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; natural learning. See John Holt, &quot;Never Too Late&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I read that.  I also tried to learn to play the cello as an adult -- <br/>\nROFL!  I didn&#39;t get very far, but I did enjoy it.  (I broke a finger on <br/>\nmy left hand which healed bent, so I can&#39;t play anymore.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I recently listened to an NPR interview with a European man who in his <br/>\n&gt; 40&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; (!) went to China to learn Chinese Opera - a hugely physically <br/>\n&gt; demanding<br/>\n&gt; study despite no prior experience with gymnastics. He became expert <br/>\n&gt; and is<br/>\n&gt; now bringing traditional Chinese Opera to his home country after some <br/>\n&gt; years<br/>\n&gt; of great pain and detemination. Another is one of the young martial <br/>\n&gt; arts<br/>\n&gt; stars on TV talks about how he discovered Karate in his late teens <br/>\n&gt; (again in<br/>\n&gt; China) and then devoted himself to it every day for several years to<br/>\n&gt; accelerate his development to expert status.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think these are extreme examples and I suspect that most of our <br/>\n&gt; Unschooled<br/>\n&gt; kids who discover a calling to a physically demanding vocation (eg <br/>\n&gt; dance,<br/>\n&gt; athletics, ice skating) probably do so early enough to make their <br/>\n&gt; process<br/>\n&gt; physically easier. Naturally we do all we can to help them with their <br/>\n&gt; goals.<br/>\n&gt; My point is that even these physical development &quot;windows&quot; don&#39;t have <br/>\n&gt; to be<br/>\n&gt; seen as closed. Even adults who are scarred by school experiences can <br/>\n&gt; learn<br/>\n&gt; to read or do arithmetic, and may have a great many skills that <br/>\n&gt; demonstrate<br/>\n&gt; their intellectual abilities that they just haven&#39;t realized are <br/>\n&gt; versions of<br/>\n&gt; &quot;smart&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Truth be told, I&#39;m sorry for kids who are struggling in schools, or <br/>\n&gt; who have<br/>\n&gt; to devote hours to school work that they would prefer to be spending on<br/>\n&gt; their Joy. I would love it if every parent were ready and willing to <br/>\n&gt; fully<br/>\n&gt; engage in Unschooling for however many years a full time parental <br/>\n&gt; presence<br/>\n&gt; is needed - which may be longer in kids with intellectual challenges or<br/>\n&gt; physical disabilities. However the world evidently isn&#39;t ready for <br/>\n&gt; that kind<br/>\n&gt; of sweeping cultural alteration. I just can&#39;t give over my energy to <br/>\n&gt; talking<br/>\n&gt; about everything that is wrong with how schools <br/>\n&gt; approach/create/exaccerbate<br/>\n&gt; learning problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I hear you.

I&#39;m sorry your parents weren&#39;t <br/>\nsufficiently observant or helpful and left you with some resentments. I <br/>\nreally think that this eyesight thing was something, especially in another <br/>\nera, that parents did expect the schools to keep track of. This story of the <br/>\nsmart kid unable to see and thought to be dumb and then being saved by a <br/>\ncaring teacher is kind of folklore. There is even an episode of &quot;The <br/>\nWaltons&quot; dealing with it - Mrs. Walton found the poverty stricken kid <br/>\nglasses out of a pile at the second hand store and presto he became clever. <br/>\nIt is a shame you got stuck with a bad teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is comparing apples and oranges to use one&#39;s negative school experiences <br/>\nas a template for how to Unschool, other than in a &quot;won&#39;t do THAT&quot; kind of <br/>\nway.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn households where Unschooling is flourishing the parents are beyond merely <br/>\n&quot;attentive&quot;; we are truly connected and engaged. Connected relationships are <br/>\nthe primary goal and result of Unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &gt; Even at home, when I&#39;d scoot closer to the TV, I&#39;d be admonished to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; move back; my &quot;but I can&#39;t see it&quot; was ignored. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unschooling parents don&#39;t ignore their children&#39;s statements of discomfort!<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &gt; Lately, I&#39;ve wondered about a math related learning disability called<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; dyscalculia -- do I have some kind of LD, or am I just stupid, as I was<br/>\n&gt; taught?  Could some kind of intervention have helped -- and would that<br/>\n&gt; intervention have started with removing me from the school environment? <br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My heart goes out to you, having been told by school that you have a choice <br/>\nof seeing yourself as either disabled or stupid. I am betting that you are <br/>\n*neither*.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe information about different types of intelligences, that Sandra has <br/>\nalready posted the link to on her website, really is something that you <br/>\ncould read for your own comfort.<br/>\nwww.sandradodd.com/intelligences<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Unschoolers remove their children from the school environment, or never <br/>\nput them in it in the first place, they do not stop there. School is inside <br/>\nour heads and it requires active work to get it out of our thinking. It is a <br/>\nhydra that will pop up just when we thought we had purged it utterly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso simply removing the child from one environment is not enough. The next <br/>\npart of the work is making home and real life MORE than school - more fun, <br/>\nmore interesting, more peaceful, more engaging, more positively challenging, <br/>\nmore safe. It is not leaving a bad space and replacing it with a void or <br/>\nwith an equality.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;  Like the example below of dyslexia at Sudbury, would I have had<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; problems with math if I had never gone to school?  (That, btw, was my<br/>\n&gt; reason for not doing formal math with my kids at home.  My 19 y.o.<br/>\n&gt; daughter struggled through a college basic math class last fall and<br/>\n&gt; passed; she also decided she hates school and refused to enroll for<br/>\n&gt; another semester.) &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This sounds like a really unfortunate example of passing on math anxiety all <br/>\nunwittingly - or your dd could simply have more emphasis on some of the <br/>\nother seven or eight intelligences that Gardner lists. It is also an example <br/>\nof all-or-nothing thinking. One subject is difficult, so all of college is <br/>\nhateful. She probably needs time to heal. &quot;Refused&quot; is an active verb that <br/>\nsuggests that someone is pushing her to do something she doesn&#39;t want to.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps your dd hasn&#39;t found her true calling. Why was she going to college <br/>\nin the first place? I went to college initially straight from high school, <br/>\nstudying the wrong courses for the wrong reasons, and struggled eventually <br/>\nleaving. However after several years I returned to study something I really <br/>\nloved and it was a totally different and wonderful experience. Often the <br/>\nadmissions criteria for mature age students are different also, and maybe <br/>\nsome of the irrelevant basic classes will no longer be required.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &gt; That&#39;s certainly possible.

We wouldn&#39;t feel the need to use this passion <br/>\nas a tool for improving her or addressing perceived (ie by society at large) <br/>\ndeficits - even though I would expect that other parts of her life would <br/>\nbecome better and fuller as a side effect and that she would feel better <br/>\nabout herself.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  if we ignore the fact a child is &quot;behind&quot; in reading, are we going to <br/>\nmiss the opportunity to intervene for that child?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The fact&quot; is not a fact at all. It is a subjective judgement, an <br/>\nevaluation, that is coming from schoolish thinking. This is also another <br/>\nexample of unexamined colloquialism.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it worth examining this &quot;window of opportunity&quot; idea, the idea that <br/>\noutside of a certain window skills aquisition becomes at best very difficult <br/>\nif not impossible.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect that for most children this concept is one that is very schooly. <br/>\nSchools have their schedules - for the &quot;gifted&quot;, for the average, for the <br/>\n&quot;learning disabled&quot;. The idea that a child has missed the window could be <br/>\nthe very one that causes that child to give up on himself and feel bad about <br/>\nherself and never try again. I don&#39;t like it. I think it is a barrier to <br/>\nnatural learning. See John Holt, &quot;Never Too Late&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently listened to an NPR interview with a European man who in his 40&#39;s <br/>\n(!) went to China to learn Chinese Opera - a hugely physically demanding <br/>\nstudy despite no prior experience with gymnastics. He became expert and is <br/>\nnow bringing traditional Chinese Opera to his home country after some years <br/>\nof great pain and detemination. Another is one of the young martial arts <br/>\nstars on TV talks about how he discovered Karate in his late teens (again in <br/>\nChina) and then devoted himself to it every day for several years to <br/>\naccelerate his development to expert status.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think these are extreme examples and I suspect that most of our Unschooled <br/>\nkids who discover a calling to a physically demanding vocation (eg dance, <br/>\nathletics, ice skating) probably do so early enough to make their process <br/>\nphysically easier. Naturally we do all we can to help them with their goals. <br/>\nMy point is that even these physical development &quot;windows&quot; don&#39;t have to be <br/>\nseen as closed. Even adults who are scarred by school experiences can learn <br/>\nto read or do arithmetic, and may have a great many skills that demonstrate <br/>\ntheir intellectual abilities that they just haven&#39;t realized are versions of <br/>\n&quot;smart&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nTruth be told, I&#39;m sorry for kids who are struggling in schools, or who have <br/>\nto devote hours to school work that they would prefer to be spending on <br/>\ntheir Joy. I would love it if every parent were ready and willing to fully <br/>\nengage in Unschooling for however many years a full time parental presence <br/>\nis needed - which may be longer in kids with intellectual challenges or <br/>\nphysical disabilities. However the world evidently isn&#39;t ready for that kind <br/>\nof sweeping cultural alteration. I just can&#39;t give over my energy to talking <br/>\nabout everything that is wrong with how schools approach/create/exaccerbate <br/>\nlearning problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one gets to &quot;intervene&quot; with my child. Granny can ask &quot;Is she reading <br/>\nyet?&quot; and go on about how she read early til she turns blue; I am not going <br/>\nto make one single change in how I interact with Jayn until/unless Jayn <br/>\nshows me she wants something different.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

In order for a parent to<br/>\nunschool, they need to be tuned in with their child and doing all they can<br/>\nto meet their needs. (not trying to catch them up with other kids but meet<br/>\nthem where they are, where ever that might be)  There might be something a<br/>\nparent can learn from professionals who have dealt with similar issues with<br/>\nkids, but most often if the child isn&#39;t in the school setting and being<br/>\nexpected to be on the same level as the other kids his age, then where ever<br/>\nhe is shouldn&#39;t be an issue.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids with differences are parented by parents who are very disconnected<br/>\nfrom them.  They have no idea what to do or how to engage them, or they just<br/>\nchoose not to. ??   I saw one example of this on a reality show (super nanny<br/>\nor one similar) and sadly I&#39;ve seen it in real life too in my own extended<br/>\nfamily.  They had a child with speech issues (and he was slightly autistic<br/>\ntoo, I think) but they did nothing to engage him at all.  The nanny had a<br/>\nspeech therapist come to help him but she also had the parents sit down and<br/>\nplay a board game with him and actually talk to him and this was the first<br/>\ntime the parents had ever played a board game with their 6 or 7 year old,<br/>\nthough he was quite capable and he really enjoyed it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seemed like (and who knows how they edited it) he was never engaged with<br/>\nthem in speech in a close and personal way in which he might naturally learn<br/>\nto annunciate correctly.  They did their adult thing and he played with his<br/>\nsiblings or alone.  There was no personal interaction.  It doesn&#39;t seem like<br/>\nan unschooling parent would be in this position if they had their child&#39;s<br/>\nbest interests at heart.  Hopefully they would have been engaging him since<br/>\nhe was a baby and he would have learned to annunciate correctly in time on<br/>\nhis own.

Are you asking at what point should one involve a<br/>\n&quot;professional&quot;? I don&#39;t think that unschooling excludes outside<br/>\nsupport/help...my then-8 yo decided to get speech therapy...at the local<br/>\npublic school no less. He decided...I didn&#39;t think he needed it myself. He<br/>\nwent for 6 months weekly, got some out of it, then was done. That was 5<br/>\nyears ago. We&#39;ve involved all kinds of outside people in our lives based on<br/>\nwho are kids were...but never because we believed there was anything wrong<br/>\nwith our kids...only if the person enhanced their lives in some way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Can we responsibly accept every indicator of a problem as<br/>\n&gt;&gt;that child&#39;s unique way of being?&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a tricky line to draw. It appears what you are saying (to me anyway)<br/>\nis that there is &quot;different&quot; and then there is &quot;problem&quot;. Who decides where<br/>\nthat line is drawn? And then if the line IS drawn, does that not create a<br/>\nbarrier, a &quot;us&quot; vs &quot;them&quot; scenario, a &quot;he-who-is-not-quite-right&quot; category?<br/>\nAnd then how does that new category actually benefit the child?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;There are therapies that help<br/>\n&gt;&gt;dyslexia, for instance;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are some who say that dyslexia is caused by forcing reading before the<br/>\nbrain is ready. Sudbury Valley School says they have never had a case of<br/>\ndyslexia in 35 years of schooling 50 to 200 students each year. They never<br/>\neven suggest learning to read. Kids decide everything in their day there,<br/>\nand year after year kids just start to read when they&#39;re ready, and some<br/>\nkids are 12 before they decide it is time. If all children were left to<br/>\ntheir own devices, maybe dyslexia would never even exist. I think it is a<br/>\npossibility.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;if we ignore the fact a child is &quot;behind&quot; in<br/>\n&gt;&gt;reading, are we going to miss the opportunity to intervene for that<br/>\n&gt;&gt;child?&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Behind what? Who decides what and when is &quot;behind&quot;. These are the questions<br/>\nthat pop up for me when I read this sentence. I can assure you that the<br/>\nstandards set in most people&#39;s minds of when a child should be reading<br/>\noriginated from a person&#39;s best guess based on partial information. And from<br/>\nthere, suddenly all children who aren&#39;t reading by 8 are &quot;behind&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Many of those kids are in very intensive therapies;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have a child that some people would say I was negligent with for not<br/>\nengaging in all these therapies. I thank God we didn&#39;t jump onto that<br/>\nbandwagon!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;for some, riding<br/>\n&gt;&gt;was their one break in the week,&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So sad.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;The parents are convinced the kids need all of it, but is<br/>\n&gt;&gt;there a home/unschooling alternative?&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Even in the cases of children who are away from &quot;the norm&quot;, the principles<br/>\nof unschooling remain. Listen, engage with, support, enrich,<br/>\nappreciate...know your children. And maybe an outside source of help really<br/>\ndoes seem to be a good thing, as long as it is not a decision based on<br/>\nparent anxiety. Start with what the child would love.<br/>\n<br/>\nJacki</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":216914372,"authorName":"riasplace3","from":"&quot;riasplace3&quot; &lt;riasplace3@...&gt;","profile":"riasplace3","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: LD & what&#39;s normal","postDate":"1174422044","msgId":28228,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGV0cGZtcytmZGk2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGI4YjIyYmRmOTYzMzkzYTJmZWNiMGY3NjgxNjU5NDg0QGNveC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":28227,"nextInTopic":28230,"prevInTime":28227,"nextInTime":28229,"topicId":28225,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... really ... as ... in ...

If it&#39;s the school which<br/>\noften identifies these problems, and we never send our kids, how do we<br/>\nknow if they&#39;re just following their own timetable, or if they need<br/>\nsome kind of intervention?  What happens if we miss a developmental<br/>\nwindow?  Are there truly such things?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve worked on the edges of these issues for a few years now, in my<br/>\ncapacity as a volunteer with therapeutic horseback riding programs.<br/>\nI&#39;ve talked to lots of parents whose kids suffer in mainstream classes<br/>\nor special ed., yet they often find the idea of homeschooling appalling<br/>\nbecause they have enough trouble as it is.  Unschooling is simply<br/>\nbeyond their capacity to consider, and frankly, I don&#39;t know if it<br/>\nwould be helpful for their kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nFYI, I have no idea what, if anything, is &quot;wrong&quot; with the child<br/>\ndescribed above, and that&#39;s my point -- the parent who wrote doesn&#39;t,<br/>\neither, and has chosen to ask this list.  Can anyone here shed light on<br/>\nthe problem (other than suggesting we not view our unique children as<br/>\n&quot;problems&quot; ;-) ?  Would professional evaluation be helpful to the<br/>\nchild?  Would that open the door to all kinds of problems, legal or<br/>\notherwise, for the family?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you live your lives as if school did not exist, what would they look <br/>\nlike?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there were no &quot;standards&quot; to judge children by, who would seem <br/>\nabnormal?<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, some children are different---VERY different from the norm. But if <br/>\nyou treat EACH child as an individual ---each with his own strengths, <br/>\nWHY would that be an issue? I have a &quot;normal&quot; (by all societal <br/>\nmeasures---not ADHD, not autistic, not aspie, not ODD, not delayed in <br/>\nany way) 11 year old son. Can&#39;t ride a bike and can&#39;t tie his shoes. He <br/>\nfell trying to ride when he was four and has had zero interest since <br/>\nthem. Has always had velcro shoes or slip-ons. Is he developmentally <br/>\ndelayed? Because he doesn&#39;t ride a bike or tie bows?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t ride a bike. Used to, not any more. I only own one pair of <br/>\nlace-up shoes. Problem?<br/>\n<br/>\nEach and every one of us is unique. Some do things faster and/or better <br/>\nthan others. Some are slower and/or not as good as others. It&#39;s truly <br/>\nALL OK!<br/>\n<br/>\nI definitely think that unschooling children who are considered <br/>\n&quot;behind&quot; or &quot;different&quot; is ZILLIONZ times better than sending them to a <br/>\n&quot;life-in-a-box&quot; existence where everything they say or do is criticized <br/>\nor corrected by experts. At home with folks who love and honor <br/>\nthem---and most importantly, who accept them how and for who they <br/>\nare!--- they will have many more opportunities to thrive and become <br/>\nthey best persons they can be!<br/>\n<br/>\nSchools dont&#39; want &#39;em---not really. I mean: the schools may love the <br/>\nextra $$$, but these children can be extremely disruptive. They never <br/>\nfeel wanted there. How can you feel worthy if you don&#39;t even feel <br/>\nwanted???<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t imagine a BETTER place than with loving parents who understand <br/>\nand work with your strengths.
