Kirby had the most childlike childhood, all Sesame <br/>\nStreet and sorting blocks and quiet slow walks with mom.    Marty had the <br/>\nfallout of Kirby&#39;s older activities.   Holly, #3, had to move the Ninja Turtles to <br/>\nlearn to crawl. &lt;g&gt;   (More below the matching summary review:)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -=-I remember when my first child was little and our house really was very<br/>\n&gt; peaceful and quiet a lot of the time.  But the thought of trying to keep him<br/>\n&gt; at that stage instead of joyfully following him into his various other<br/>\n&gt; stages with all the noisy messy wonderfulness would be really sad.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; great,though, to live in that place with him while he&#39;s there.  The house<br/>\n&gt; was a much &quot;livelier&quot; environment by the time #3 came along.  But her sweet<br/>\n&gt; peaceful stage purred along just beneath the din.  Her noisy stage was even<br/>\n&gt; louder than the others&#39; because the point of it is to be heard.  She had to<br/>\n&gt; be heard over all of our busy lives -and she was : )   FWIW, it&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt; oldest, who had that quiet toddler hood , who is biggest into video games<br/>\n&gt; and such now.  The little one (now 5) doesn&#39;t watch near as much TV though<br/>\n&gt; she&#39;s welcome to it.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-(can you tell i&#39;m writing this at 2am?)-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>They&#39;ve all managed to find LOTS of peace and quiet and privacy, and plenty <br/>\nof noise and activity and interaction.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Teaching&quot; a child peace through and in the absence of any options isn&#39;t anyt<br/>\nhing at all.   How will he respond in a crisis?   What will he do if he&#39;s <br/>\nvisiting elsewhere and everyday-lack-of-peace arises?<br/>\n<br/>\nSerenity is no great trick in a padded, muffled world.    If someone can <br/>\ncreate, maintain and experience peace in normal circumstances, THAT is really <br/>\nuseful.   One of the most soothing, calming men I ever knew became a police <br/>\nofficer.   And one of his best tricks, I hear, is walking up where people are <br/>\narguing, and just BEING peaceful so that they&#39;re sucked into his peacefulness.    <br/>\nI&#39;ve seen other men do that too.   It&#39;s a gift.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23066,"nextTopicId":23074}}
