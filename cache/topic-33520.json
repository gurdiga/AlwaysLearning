Take the back <br/>\nroads, and stay off the freeway. You will find interesting houses, <br/>\nyards, parks, views, and you can listen to music longer, or books on <br/>\ntape/cd or play car games, or plain old talk. You can get lost a <br/>\nlittle and try to find your way back to somewhere familiar and ask your <br/>\nkids for help with which direction to turn.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ahhh! (Light bulb goes on!) I never think of those things that are so obvious sometimes! My son is in that &quot;I hate going to the store&quot; mode and I hadn&#39;t even thought to drive to the next town to do it.....duh!<br/>\n  Thanks for expanding my world a bit!
