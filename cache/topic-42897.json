Then he<br/>\nwent out into the world and he tried some drugs that really weren&#39;t so bad,<br/>\nin his experience; maybe a beer here, a joint there. So he&#39;s lost faith in<br/>\nthose who told him Drugs are Bad in general terms, without truly discussion<br/>\ndrugs with names and their effects and with honesty and connection in a<br/>\nloving relationship with a parent (or other super trusted adult). If those<br/>\nsame Drugs are Bad people try to warn him away from Heroin, where is their<br/>\ncredibility? They&#39;ve already lied by omitting the true information about the<br/>\nBad Drugs of which they spoke. That credibility is very important to me. I<br/>\nwant to be honest and open, information is power. At least, should Hayden<br/>\nuse, I will be comfortable in knowing he is informed. At our house, Heroin<br/>\nis described as a lifetime commitment, not a recreational toy. We&#39;ve talked<br/>\nof the heroin program in Amsterdam.

For me, it&#39;s kind of<br/>\ninformed consent in our everyday consumption (and I thought I was being<br/>\ninformative... these were the years before unschooling found me ;)) - Mama&#39;s<br/>\nRed Can contains drugs, pure and simple. Caffeine is a strong stimulant, it<br/>\nis indeed a drug. (and it helps one poop!) Common - yes, accepted - yes, not<br/>\ntalked about - sadly, yes.  I don&#39;t use the term &quot;drugs and alcohol&quot; because<br/>\nalcohol *IS* a drug, a very fun-at-times depressant. Drugs are drugs are<br/>\ndrugs. Different effects in different doses in different situations in<br/>\ndifferent people at different times in life.  That&#39;s a truth.  Drugs are<br/>\neverywhere, hypocricy about drugs is everywhere. Truth is the best thing you<br/>\ncan offer. With a balance of information, pros and cons.  Just as I think<br/>\nthat Sex Information *is* birth control, I think Drug Information is<br/>\npersonal responsibility.  If one says Cocaine kills (as it has) and someone<br/>\nwitnesses cocaine use that *doesn&#39;t* result in death. That statement is an<br/>\nlie of omission - it&#39;s not full of useful information with which one can be<br/>\nexpected to make a reasonable responsible personal decision.  In that<br/>\ninstance any previous wisdom shared is moot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen the societal component is the government of the United States has<br/>\ndecided that instead of allowing the people access to all the drugs there<br/>\nare, some drugs are forbidden.  This can lead to a conversation about hemp<br/>\nin america, levi-strauss, Howard Hughes, the cotton industry, the FDA<br/>\n(nutrasweet vs sativa is a good story) OPEC, NORML, Christopher Columbus<br/>\n(who&#39;s sails and ropes were of the finest european hemp), Amsterdam, the<br/>\nfarmers of the midwest during the war were paid to grow hemp, hemp is grown<br/>\neach year on the Pine Ridge Reservation by Henry John Red Cloud (which could<br/>\nlead to 10 million conversations right there), medical cards in CA and OR,<br/>\nmedical benefits, oil soluable chemicals, on and on and on...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m very matter of fact. Hayden&#39;s experienced a lot of different situations<br/>\nin his life, he&#39;s asked questions, he&#39;s gathered answers, he has plenty of<br/>\nanecdotal information with which to make his own decisions when that time<br/>\ncomes.  I imagine I will be a large part of the decision to use process.<br/>\nI take great care to not be hypocrytical with my information. I&#39;m honest<br/>\n(and age-appropriate) and I use the term medicate when talking about any<br/>\ndrug use - aha! yet another 12 billion connections with the true medical<br/>\nvalue of most illicit drugs :)  Coca-cola had cocaine, to help housewives<br/>\nhave enough energy to do the ironing happily. Opiate-sythetics are used<br/>\nmedicinally (because they can be pantented and profited from) and are quite<br/>\npopular by prescription.  Hell, even heroin has it&#39;s benefits; I *can*<br/>\nimagine the kind of pain required to desire the relief from Heroin. I didn&#39;t<br/>\ndo it, I&#39;m scared to death of it, I&#39;m not willing to commit my LIFE to it,<br/>\nbut by golly, I&#39;ve been so deep in the barrell of pain I *wanted* the sweet<br/>\nrelief it I knew I could provide, if only temporarily.  I&#39;m far past that<br/>\nnow, it was a quick and powerful moment in my life.<br/>\nWe went to a going away party for Scotty, when we moved. I told Hayden (then<br/>\n8) it was a Keg and informed him folks would probably be standing around<br/>\nsmoking pot.  Our car ride home conversation:<br/>\nH: There were drugs at the party<br/>\nD: That&#39;s why we told you beforehand...<br/>\nH: No mom, not just beer and pot, there was cocaine and acid.<br/>\nD: Really?! How do you know? Did you see it?<br/>\nH: No, in the kitchen someone said, &quot;you shouldn&#39;t combine cocaine and<br/>\nacid&quot;  ... why not?<br/>\nD: Well cocaine creates a euphoric high, with lots of energy and acid<br/>\ncreates hallucinations which may be tough to deal by themselves, let alone<br/>\nwhen you&#39;re possibly jittery from the coke.  Not a safe experiment,<br/>\nnecessarily.  Coke&#39;s pretty easy to overdose on, one must be really careful<br/>\nif they&#39;re using.<br/>\nH: Cool.  So when we get home, can we....

Maybe<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s heeding old tapes, I don&#39;t know... I thought about treating it as I<br/>\n&gt; would alcohol, nicotine and other things that have *always* been part of<br/>\n&gt; our<br/>\n&gt; conversation-or at least for as long as I can remember... but those things<br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t illegal.

It&#39;s taken me <br/>\na while to ask, because I wasn&#39;t sure if I wanted to ask the  adults here or <br/>\nthe kids on Cameron&#39;s &quot;Offspring&quot; group, but since there are so  many youngers <br/>\nthere, I figured here was better. I&#39;m not really scared or  anything, just <br/>\nuncertain, so I thought I&#39;d ask for some guidance and words of  wisdom. Thanks.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nDe<br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://and-the-kitchen-sink.blogspot.com/_\">http://and-the-kitchen-sink.blogspot.com/_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://and-the-kitchen-sink.blogspot.com/)\">http://and-the-kitchen-sink.blogspot.com/)</a> <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://whatshappeningwiththesmiths.blogspot.com/_\">http://whatshappeningwiththesmiths.blogspot.com/_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://whatshappeningwiththesmiths.blogspot.com/)\">http://whatshappeningwiththesmiths.blogspot.com/)</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n**************Need a job?
