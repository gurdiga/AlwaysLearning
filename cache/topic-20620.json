In our better times, the usually stressing plan to leave at 7am (which<br/>\ninevitably ends up being 12pm) is dropped for the more relaxed and exciting<br/>\nplan of taking our time, making sure we have what we want, and going out the<br/>\ndoor.

Hard to say, but it can&#39;t be much because we were living and<br/>\nenjoying the moment!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis doesn&#39;t work so well when we have to catch a flight, but that&#39;s when we<br/>\nfind out we really DON&#39;T have to have everything packed that we think we do,<br/>\nor HAVE to take a shower before we leave, or nowadays, even HAVE to have the<br/>\nplane ticket in tow :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJacki</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":10590565,"authorName":"conniecolten@aol.com","from":"conniecolten@...","profile":"conniecolten","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: changing your thinking to make peace","postDate":"1094411086","msgId":20620,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGMuMzI4MzNmY2IuMmU2Y2JkNGVAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":20622,"prevInTime":20619,"nextInTime":20621,"topicId":20620,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
