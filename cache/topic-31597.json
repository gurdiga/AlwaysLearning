We had a neopets account a few years ago and it was fun. Kids<br/>\nweren&#39;t really intrigued by it at the time, but I played. :)  Now they are<br/>\ninterested and want their own accounts. So we signed up and discovered that<br/>\nthings require &quot;neocash&quot; now. Appreciate the heads-up on the free stuff -<br/>\nthat rocks!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the sites the kids really like right now - such as brainpop, adventure<br/>\nquest, club penguin - allow limited free play, but require a subscription or<br/>\npurchase of &quot;points&quot; or whatever the platform calls money (poe, bucks, etc).<br/>\nI&#39;ve tried to wrap my head around it... and figure out how it&#39;s possible to<br/>\nafford these subscriptions and purchases each month for every site. Club<br/>\nPenguin is fairly reasonable - $5.95 - but others want $30 to $50 or more a<br/>\nmonth to be a &quot;full&quot; member. It starts adding up fast!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just got Mehalje a BarbieGirl mp3 player ($50) which allows her to use<br/>\nall the features of the bariegirl website - hooking the player to the<br/>\ncomputer is the only option available to get full access. After plugging it<br/>\nin and registering it, we found out it only gives her a 1 year subscription<br/>\nto the site. Not saying she&#39;ll still be interested in it a year from now,<br/>\nbut if she is I guess the site designers expect us to go out and buy another<br/>\nmp3 player to continue her subscription?<br/>\n<br/>\nGotta go, kids want to run to the movie store.<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Susan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":142317298,"authorName":"tracyliebmann","from":"&quot;tracyliebmann&quot; &lt;tracyliebmann@...&gt;","profile":"tracyliebmann","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Neopets:  It&#39;s no WoW...","postDate":"1196552307","msgId":31598,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZpc3I5ais3dWc5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhGQzkyRjFELUNFQjktNEIyMi1CRkI1LTQyQUU3OTJFMUUyOUBTYW5kcmFEb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":31597,"nextInTopic":31599,"prevInTime":31597,"nextInTime":31599,"topicId":31597,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My kids say they don t like neopets anymore because all the cool stuff cost money now  FREE is good.
