The best you can do is set things up for as much success as possible. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat kinds of situations are coming up? Playground stuff? Be right there with him, close enough, ready enough that if he slips you&#39;ve got him. Resist the urge to socialize with other adults when you have a busy, active child who needs one-on-one support, but realize other adults may not do the same. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs he getting into things at your mother&#39;s house, maybe? It might be better to stay away for awhile, only go over when you can stick to him like glue and help him explore and let him know what the perils and boundaries are. If grandam doesn&#39;t want her knick-knacks touched or furniture climbed on, respect that. That may mean asking grandma to meet you other places for awhile, so that your little guy can run around without hearing so many &quot;nos&quot; - be gentle and friendly and do the inviting &quot;come join us at...&quot; and maybe let grandma know that you want her to &quot;spoil&quot; him to her hearts content, and leave any &quot;discipline&quot; to you. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll that being said, there&#39;s no special unschooling rule like &quot;never say no&quot; - sometimes &quot;no&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t&quot; are the best responses in the moment!<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":187853867,"authorName":"aldq75","from":"&quot;aldq75&quot; &lt;aldq75@...&gt;","profile":"aldq75","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Starting out","postDate":"1285960270","msgId":57560,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGk4NWJvZStmcGozQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PFNOVDEwOC1XMzY1NzMyQUMxNTI3MDFDQTA5OTQ2MUI0NjkwQHBoeC5nYmw+"},"prevInTopic":57559,"nextInTopic":57561,"prevInTime":57559,"nextInTime":57561,"topicId":57557,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"HSLDA has a quick summary of the laws for each state: http://www.hslda.org/laws/default.asp","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1277179891\">HSLDA has a quick summary of the laws for each state:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hslda.org/laws/default.asp\">http://www.hslda.org/laws/default.asp</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Ivalee Hackney &lt;horizonsmassage@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hello everyone.
