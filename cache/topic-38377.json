I am a hugely better mama (and  person) having <br/>\nborn my first at 33 rather than 21. Hugely. So far from  &quot;traditional&quot; and <br/>\n&quot;mainstream&quot; that I think folks who knew me in high school  wouldn&#39;t recognize the <br/>\nperson I am today (personality wise).

I know they&#39;re more  open-minded <br/>\nabout things and more interested in what is good rather than how to  please. They <br/>\nknow their own minds before 10 years old the way it took me over 35  years to <br/>\ndo-maybe even moreso than I do.

Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past week each of my children has impressed me with a kind of  <br/>\nmaturity I didn&#39;t have at their ages.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty broke up with his girlfriend, and talked to me about it.  He  <br/>\nwas concerned about her wellbeing, hoped to maintain the friendship,  <br/>\nwanted to make sure he fulfilled things she had counted on him to do  <br/>\n(he&#39;s still willing to help her paint her house... did I mention she  <br/>\nhas her own place?  Yeah.... I know I didn&#39;t, but it&#39;s a factor in my  <br/>\nmind).   It was his decision.  I asked him if there was someone else  <br/>\nhe liked, and he said no, it wasn&#39;t that.   And he LIKES the girl.   <br/>\nHe said something like he just didn&#39;t have the urge to reproduce with  <br/>\nher (he might&#39;ve said procreate).  So I think he was saying he wasn&#39;t  <br/>\nmadly in love with her.  I didn&#39;t quiz him further than what he  <br/>\nvolunteered to share.  Maybe he meant he didn&#39;t think she would be a  <br/>\ngood mom for some reason, but he didn&#39;t say that.  I think it was a  <br/>\ncomment about his feelings about her.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby had been scheduled to go to Las Vegas, Nevada (we always  <br/>\nspecify in New Mexico, because Las Vegas alone is Las Vegas, New  <br/>\nMexico) this week, to be at Treasure Island for &quot;Talk Like a Pirate  <br/>\nDay.&quot;   The loss of that plan came in stages.  Several of his co- <br/>\nworkers had heard they would all get a bonus at a certain time and  <br/>\ndecided to spend it on a trip to Las Vegas, but that bonus didn&#39;t  <br/>\ncome through (or not yet, anyway).  Then his roommate had invited a  <br/>\nbunch of his high school friends to meet them there too there, but  <br/>\nthey all drink for fun.  So Kirby told me (a few hours after I had  <br/>\ntalked to Marty about his relationship change) that he had decided it  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t worth the money and time off to him, as he doesn&#39;t want to  <br/>\ngamble or get drunk.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly&#39;s is more subtle but involves a desire not to discuss having  <br/>\nchildren with her current boyfriend (not to discuss the topic with  <br/>\nanyone) because at the moment she can&#39;t figure out  how she would  <br/>\ndeal with his mother.  I reminded her that it&#39;s not something she  <br/>\nneeds to think about right away, and so she doesn&#39;t want to talk  <br/>\nabout it or think about it.  She loves the guy, and they get along  <br/>\nvery well, and he clearly loves her.  They both have a lot of growing  <br/>\nand thinking to do.   What brought that on, though, was his visit to  <br/>\nhis grandmother&#39;s where he talked with his sister and aunt and  <br/>\ngrandmother, about Holly, and they expressed concern about whether,  <br/>\nif he stayed with Holly longterm, their children would be  <br/>\nhomeschooled or go to school.  He said he doesn&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if he and Holly got married and stayed together until 2059, it  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t guarantee they would even *have* children.  Just thinking  <br/>\nabout all the possible pressures was too much for Holly to think  <br/>\nabout, and I don&#39;t blame her.  MANY teens and young adults and even  <br/>\nyoung parents are absolutely positively sure in advance what they  <br/>\n*are* going to do, and it turns out to be wrong!   They change their  <br/>\nmind, for a myriad of reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly would love to have children, but she&#39;s considering the inlaws  <br/>\nin her thoughts about who the father should be.  And laws are  <br/>\nchanging all around us.  It used to be that staying unmarried was all  <br/>\nthe safety a mom needed to be able to make all her own decisions  <br/>\nabout the child-rearing, but recent legal cases have blown that away.  <br/>\nThe government holds biological fathers responsible for child support  <br/>\n(at least they do where I live), and the moms can&#39;t easily cut off  <br/>\nfrom the obligation to let fathers AND grandparents have access to  <br/>\nthe child.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut given all that in less than a week&#39;s time, I&#39;m feeling very  <br/>\nconfident that my kids can and will live mindfully and responsibly,  <br/>\nbecause they already are.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n(P.S. to those to whom I&#39;ve said &quot;You can quote anything I&#39;ve ever  <br/>\nwritten.&quot;    Please keep this one here, and quiet.
