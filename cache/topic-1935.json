I&#39;ve read a lot recently from writers with a different take on goals, and our goal (and associated failure)-oriented society.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne take from a non-unschooling (though he likes a lot of the ideas) writer talked about the idea of themes instead of goals, and I like it. He wrote a long blog post (and his are both very long and tend to go through an interestingly convoluted story before reaching some kind of list), that ended with the following part that flows from what Sandra posted:<br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\n&quot;Having goals is no good.<br/>\n <br/>\nGoals, in an extreme, mean you aren&#39;t happy until you get your goal. And then what? How can you reduce suffering right now. The suffering of striving, of fear, of worry, of the pressure that you have no goals.<br/>\n <br/>\nHave a theme. You can build your days around your themes. I want to learn more. I want to be healthy. I want to be good to people. I want to help people feel good about themselves. I want to be creative. I want to depend on my inward self instead of the outer events that throw from shore to shore.<br/>\n <br/>\nAn important theme for me is to every day focus on physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health as much as possible. For me, I know that works. Works for what? Who cares. It just works. Whatever your theme is, check it throughout the day  Ask: am I living by my theme?<br/>\n <br/>\nIn the short blink that thins out your life, when you reach the point where  goals matter no more, the themes of your life will still shine bright. And when it comes time to measure your immortality, it&#39;s the themes you leave behind that will have more impact than the goals, money, loves, lives you&#39;ve lived.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n(from James Altucher&#39;s post: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2012/10/i-need-a-check-for-one-million-dollars/)\">http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2012/10/i-need-a-check-for-one-million-dollars/)</a><br/>\n----<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about the themes you want in your life, and decide each moment to move closer to them, instead of further away.
