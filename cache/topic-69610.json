There&#39;s no requirement to read every word every day. There&#39;s no requirement to learn a new language to read this list. People should be able to jump in anytime.)<br/>\n<br/>\nToo many people grew up having to shove down their feelings and thoughts. They are looking for permission to finally express exactly what they feel without censorship. The concepts of &quot;authentic&quot; and &quot;transparent&quot; seemingly tell them, &quot;Say whatever you feel and believe. Don&#39;t hide who you are.&quot; People will read into the words what they need them to mean.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat the words mean something else to you is problematic when the goal on this list is being as clear as possible to a diverse and always changing readership. To use the words as you&#39;re using them, would mean studying a whole &#39;nother philosophy in addition to unschooling. Then working to dump a load of baggage to take on that point of view.<br/>\n<br/>\nPassing meaning onto others as cleanly as possible is why people are urged to use plain English. It&#39;s bad enough &quot;unschooling&quot; conjures up false images ;-) People want to throw in RU, authentic, edutainment, attachment, freedom, rights ... <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling ideas are hard enough to understand. It won&#39;t help to label new concepts with common words. It won&#39;t help to label them with new words either! Best to begin where people are likely to be and build an understanding of unschooling using what they already know.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If I am a wreck and my discernment guides me to remove myself from being<br/>\n&gt; with my children because I deem it inappropriate to be around them with my<br/>\n&gt; baggage, then I will.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which is a twisty way of avoiding the word judge that seems to hold too much baggage for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscernment is a good word. My dictionary says &quot;the ability to judge.&quot; :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it also goes on to say &quot;(in Christian contexts) perception in the absence of judgment with a view to obtaining spiritual direction and understanding.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if you&#39;ve pulled it out to give it a secular meaning, that adds another layer of philosophy to the concept &quot;discernment&quot; is being used as a label for. It won&#39;t help people unschool to expect them to learn a bunch of new ways of using common words to understand what we&#39;re saying here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; However, I will not lie or shroud the event in some false pretense, I will<br/>\n&gt; be authentic and transparent, announcing that I am not ok right now and I<br/>\n&gt; think it best if I remove myself, rather than lying.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Those are your only two choices: being authentic or lying?<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscernment should allow a parent to decide each time what&#39;s better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that&#39;s not what you mean. But what you said is the choices are between being &quot;authentic&quot; and lying. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor a parent, making a good choice in a crisis is good. But for unschooling the larger focus should be on finding ways to not repeat the same choices that led to a crisis. Be proactive. The more a mom can do to avoid being a wreck, the more peaceful life can be, and the better she and the kids will  handle the times when the downward slide catches mom by surprise.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Rude or not rude is a judgment and in being so, is subjective.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But my feelings aren&#39;t subjective. They&#39;re real yucky feelings. If someone did something that created those yucky feelings, and they dismiss my judgment of their actions as subjective, that&#39;s going to make me even more upset!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of living peacefully with each other, in terms of helping out kids live peacefully with others, it won&#39;t help to see people&#39;s feelings as reactions to subjective judgements.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether I&#39;m right that something was rude or not, isn&#39;t the issue! The issue is avoiding doing what is likely to cause others distress.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If I take a cupcake and fling it at the birthday boy, he may think it is<br/>\n&gt; funny as hell and laugh his way into the pool to wash off, whereas his mom<br/>\n&gt; may think this was rude and inappropriate.  Who makes the ultimate call as<br/>\n&gt; to whether the boy who flinged the cupcake goes home or stays?  The kid who<br/>\n&gt; is laughing with his face covered in cupcake or the angry mom?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Made up situations aren&#39;t good for clear discussions. Real people have reasons for what they do and what they feel. Pretend people can be twisted into whatever point someone wants to make.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a hostess feels someone is upsetting her guests, she is right in asking them to leave. <br/>\n<br/>\nFeelings are what count in getting along with others, not the rightness or wrongness of their judging or their judgement. That&#39;s the world unschooling kids will be released into.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; So a judgment of rudeness or hurtfulness means the other person is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; feeling insecure or inadequate?&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A dog bite received ....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No. If my guests are upset that your child is flinging cupcakes causing other kids to fling cupcakes and you&#39;re not stopping your son, that means I&#39;m insecure or inadequate?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it the label of rudeness that you&#39;re trying to avoid? Are you saying look at the feelings, not at the judgement of what caused those feelings? Is that where the hang up is?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a lot of words and twisty thoughts to prevent a common word from stirring baggage. Much simpler to work at letting go of the emotional baggage that gets stirred up by the thought of being judged. Not simple! But more straightforward.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it works for you, if your kids are happy, keep doing it. But for an unschooling list, straightforward ideas are better than tacking on an additional philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; When we judge, we look outside of ourselves to what should or shouldnâ€št be<br/>\n&gt; happening, we are interpreting what happened now in light of what happened<br/>\n&gt; back then.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If it helps you treat your children better, if it helps you treat others better to think of it that way, then keep doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if it&#39;s causing you to think it means you shouldn&#39;t help your son use better judgment about cupcakes then your quest to avoid judging and it&#39;s emotional (for you) baggage isn&#39;t helping you live peacefully with the rest of the world that *is* judging and reacting with real feelings based on those judgements.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Unschooling badly","postDate":"1353347053","msgId":69666,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE1NzI2NTVGLUI4NjUtNDEzNy1BOTZELTJCRUQyNTgzRDgxQ0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBTzM0ekZiX3FpWTVpK2JrZnVuVnNOeDV6TUdPeGZEc3M2UzlkPT1vMmJqTT0ycHZuUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBTzM0ekZiX3FpWTVpK2JrZnVuVnNOeDV6TUdPeGZEc3M2UzlkPT1vMmJqTT0ycHZuUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":69664,"nextInTopic":69667,"prevInTime":69665,"nextInTime":69667,"topicId":69610,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Authenticity and transparency to me do not mean tossing out discernment and weighing children down with adult baggage. -=-If I am a wreck and my discernment","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2042324802\">-=-Authenticity and transparency to me do not mean tossing out discernment and<br/>\nweighing children down with adult baggage.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-If I am a wreck and my discernment guides me to remove myself from being<br/>\nwith my children because I deem it inappropriate to be around them with my<br/>\nbaggage, then I will.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAll those words and special definitions are likely putting a thick layer of noise between you and your children.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re causing you to have a problem with the information in this discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your discernment guides you to do ANYthing, then you&#39;re not making decisions.<br/>\nDiscernment is perception.

Not-judging is a shield that people who have been badly hurt sometimes wrap around them as a way of disconnecting from others - because others are sources of hurt. And as parents, that makes them very un-sensitive to the needs and feelings of their children, unwilling to really look at their kids and evaluate their needs and look for ways to meet them better. Because &quot;better&quot; is a judgement, so nevermind that. It&#39;s all good.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you value presence, then practice that, but realize that there&#39;s a judgement involved - you Judge presence to be better than absence or dismissal. If you value awareness, thoughtfulness, practice those because you find them good, valuable, worthy, without beating yourself up over that judgement. Living by your principles requires judgement. It doesn&#39;t require beating yourself up - but that can be embedded within your principles. If you value kindness, be kind to yourself, too. If you value presence, touch base with what You need, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe what you feel when you think about &quot;not-judging&quot; is like what I feel when I think about graciousness - and on a personal level those feelings are much more important than words or definitions, particularly if you&#39;re not a &quot;words&quot; person or an analytic person. But for most people words, the words we use in our own thoughts, can have a surprisingly large effect on the way we think about the world and ourselves, so it&#39;s useful to look hard at them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; They will live transparently and authentically, without concern for the<br/>\n&gt; opinions of others unless they have asked for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What about the opinions of your children? Don&#39;t they matter? One of the worst things a parent can do is be Too &quot;transparent and authentic&quot; with children. They don&#39;t want or need to be inflicted with the weight of adult baggage - they want to know what&#39;s going on around them, to an extent, but they don&#39;t want to be thrust into the position of parenting their parents. That&#39;s cruel. But that&#39;s where some parents get from words like &quot;transparent and authentic&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad wasn&#39;t a very communicative person when I was a kid - he did a good job being the kind of old fashioned, &quot;knight in shining armor&quot; dad he thought he was supposed to be, but it was hard to see him as a real person. My mom cried, made mistakes, explained her thinking, fumbled around for solutions, and generally was a very &quot;human&quot; person... to me, anyway. I&#39;m guessing you mean something similar when you say &quot;transparent and authentic&quot; but those are ideas which need a loooooot of good judgement to work well as principles, they need to be weighed heavily against other people&#39;s needs and feelings. Personally, I don&#39;t find it helpful to have principles which require other principles in opposition to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a way, too, in which ideas like &quot;authenticity&quot; are hurtful in that they dismiss the complexity of real people. I&#39;m a quirky sort of person, and I like that about myself, but I don&#39;t need to be quirky all the time - in fact, sometimes I don&#39;t want to be the least bit quirky, I want to be wallpaper, I want to be unremarkable. I&#39;m an opinionated person, but I don&#39;t need to be overtly opinionated all the time - I want to listen and take in the ideas of others, even if I don&#39;t agree with them. Or I want to be politely quiet because I&#39;m not in the mood to get into it, or because I don&#39;t want to hurt someone&#39;s feelings. &quot;Authenticity&quot; doesn&#39;t cover that very well. In fact, it sometimes feels insulting to me - triggering old schoolish goop about &quot;not living up to my potential&quot; as well as more adult feelings of human complexity. Because I am strong willed and quirky and opinionated... and I am also kind and gracious and try to be thoughtful. If &quot;authenticity&quot; is one of my principles, it needs another principle in opposition to it to account for that complexity. But an idea like &quot;mindfulness&quot; doesn&#39;t - I can be mindful of my needs, my feelings, the needs and feelings of others, the appropriateness of the time and place, and what I know about causes and effects. And I can weigh and judge all that information and make a decision about what to say and how to be in the moment. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":439465581,"authorName":"Robert and Colleen","from":"&quot;Robert and Colleen&quot; &lt;3potatoes@...&gt;","profile":"trespotatoes","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Unschooling badly","postDate":"1353275520","msgId":69660,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAzYTIwMWNkYzVkNiRmMDBmNzMzMCRkMDJlNTk5MCRAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PENBTzM0ekZZd2U5dVZrd0E4V3dOLWV4WGRjRk5YaVptUmh1PWJZV2tVYS1IVWh4dGVwUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBTzM0ekZZd2U5dVZrd0E4V3dOLWV4WGRjRk5YaVptUmh1PWJZV2tVYS1IVWh4dGVwUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":69659,"nextInTopic":69661,"prevInTime":69659,"nextInTime":69661,"topicId":69610,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"****Denying that there is better and worse can be the defense of someone without very much interpersonal or intrapersonal skill.**** ****Or it can be a way","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1120099791\">****Denying that there is &quot;better&quot; and &quot;worse&quot; can be the defense of someone<br/>\nwithout very much interpersonal or intrapersonal skill.****<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n****Or it can be a way of living whilst holding it all with compassion and a<br/>\ndeep sense of reverence for life.

I made the traditional recipe, which uses lard and brandy.  Another guest there who is not local and who had never seen or tasted a bizcochito in her life decided to amend the recipe to Crisco, butter and orange juice.   I didn&#39;t want her executed, but perhaps, maybe, she should have known what the cookies are supposed to be like before she changed the recipe.   Our cookies weren&#39;t equal, when the scale was &quot;those Christmas cookies from New Mexico.&quot;  If they were &quot;how to use up six cups of flour and two hours work,&quot; if the judge and jury didn&#39;t like cookies or their new religion said no gluten, then they were equal.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf one judge of what&#39;s written on Always Learning thinks unschooling is wrong and internet discussions are a waste of time, then all the posts become equal, every five-letter word is equal to any other five-letter word.  If another has come to think that there really *are* simple ways she can improve her understanding of unschooling and her relationship with her children immediately, some posts will be more valuable to her (i.e. &quot;better&quot;) than others.<br/>\n<br/>\nFamilies who share the ways in which unschooling has improved their families andtheir lives are practicing a kind of transparency that is rare and precious.  They are letting others peek into their &quot;private lives.&quot;  Because they think something has made life better, they reveal things about themselves, to pass that benefit on to others who would like to make their own lives better.   There is no benefit to discouraging people from doing that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t like the term &quot;authentic,&quot; of human behavior.  It suggests that all those doing anything differently are false, inauthentic, wrong.  <br/>\nIf it means being thoughtful and mindful, those are much better terms and concepts to use.  If it means living by principles and making careful decisions rather than stumbling along following vague rules, then let&#39;s talk about living by principles.

Excellent!  A+!&quot; it would be bullshit.  It doesn&#39;t matter.  That&#39;s not how it works.  And if lots of other people say &quot;awesome mom; your kids are lucky to have you,&quot; but the kids are unhappy, then the &quot;friends&quot; were wrong.

For those who go to coferences or meet many unschoolers in person it matters a great deal how the families function.<br/>\n<br/>\nI trust others more when I&#39;ve seen their families get along well, and have seen them be calmly enthusastic about new situations or ideas or experiences.    I trust others less when I&#39;ve seen tension and negativity.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to help others.  I want to encourage the best of others to help, and discourage the negative and the fakers from speaking and writing so much, or at least to encourage anyone looking for ideas use some discretion and judgment in where they will go and whom they will trust.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is changing directions a bit, for a minute:<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeas are ideas.  If someone plagiarizes from me or Pam Sorooshian or Anne Ohman  and puts those ideas out there as her own, the ideas will still be useful. :-)  It might be nice, though, to know where the ideas came from.  Someone who quotes other people&#39;s ideas without credit isn&#39;t honest.  When someone isn&#39;t honest, you can&#39;t put faith in their accounts of success.   It&#39;s a problem that doesn&#39;t affect everyone equally, but if someone who isn&#39;t affected denies there is a problem, it doesn&#39;t make the problem go away;  it just shows that the person saying &quot;doesn&#39;t matter&quot; isn&#39;t planning (or isn&#39;t able) to exercise critical thought in such situations.   <br/>\n<br/>\nBack to doing it well or badly...<br/>\nI don&#39;t just take a person&#39;s word for how things are going at her house, in general.  Some people say little to nothing, and unschooling is going GREAT for them.  Some people coo and brag and those who&#39;ve visited them or who know them know that it&#39;s more talk than reality.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople are that way about all kinds of things.  Some people brag about their sports prowess, and make excuses for losses.  Some people call themselves writers, or artists, or singers, but never DO that thing unless they are paid to do it, or they&#39;re waiting to be paid to do it maybe someday, but don&#39;t actually just DO it, for free, for fun.   And those things don&#39;t matter to anyone but the friends they might be irritating.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the case of something like learning about unschooling, though, it can matter.<br/>\nIf I went to La Leche League and was taking breastfeeding advice about someone who was not being honest about her own relationship with her child, then what?  If I were at Adult Children of Alcoholics meetings for a while and discovered that one of the prominent members was doing the same alcohol-abusing damage to his own family as his parents did to him, then what?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut even without witnesses, for the sake of a child it only matters how it is done within that family.<br/>\nWITH witnesses, with other unschoolers wanting to learn about unschooling from other unschoolers, then integrity and honesty matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn relationship to representatives of government agencies or family courts, what matters is how the parents are fulfilling their responsibilities under the law.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Unschooling badly","postDate":"1352830273","msgId":69627,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc0NDI1NUEwLUI5MDYtNEFCNi05Q0VCLTNENjlCRDBBM0VFRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBTzM0ekZZcXcwX1hhajdxc3NRb2c0Uz1tZkJBLXp0dll6Q3lZdXByeXpwUUFEYWdQQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBTzM0ekZZcXcwX1hhajdxc3NRb2c0Uz1tZkJBLXp0dll6Q3lZdXByeXpwUUFEYWdQQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":69626,"nextInTopic":69628,"prevInTime":69626,"nextInTime":69628,"topicId":69610,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I am actually avoiding judging any act / choice / practice as being done well or not.-=- How will you nudge your children toward better?

Denying that there is &quot;better&quot; and &quot;worse&quot; can be the defense of someone without very much interpersonal or intrapersonal skill.  I can unerstand it when someone who is tone deaf doesn&#39;t think much or melody or harmony.   But for those who do have interpersonal awareness, the difference between doing something well or badly is perceivable, and important, and that person&#39;s capacity to do well is a factor, too.   If someone works hard to do well, while someone else who could do that well with no effort is purposely slacking off, there is another relative comparison that can be important to those who might be called on to advise or defend or encourage those folks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Unschooling badly","postDate":"1352824826","msgId":69626,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgzOUIzM0FDLTJGNTgtNEVBNy1CRTBFLUQ0Q0VBOTY0RURDMkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBTzM0ekZZcXcwX1hhajdxc3NRb2c0Uz1tZkJBLXp0dll6Q3lZdXByeXpwUUFEYWdQQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBTzM0ekZZcXcwX1hhajdxc3NRb2c0Uz1tZkJBLXp0dll6Q3lZdXByeXpwUUFEYWdQQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":69625,"nextInTopic":69627,"prevInTime":69625,"nextInTime":69627,"topicId":69610,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

There was nothing in those experiences to recommend unschooling to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, admittedly, I was living in a commune at the time and living in communes you get to meet all sorts of crazy people - mostly in a good way, but still, it&#39;s not hard to argue that I had a very, very skewed sample.

If you have a spouse or partner, he or she will be judging you, too, based on the wellbeing of your children. And ideally, you&#39;re judging yourself against your own best principles and adjusting what you do to what you see.<br/>\n<br/>\nA good basic question to ask yourself regularly is: Are the kids happier than if you did something else? Happier than if they were in school or homeschooling? Sometime the answer can be yes for some of the kids in a family and no for others - and while that seems odd to me, I have a lot of respect for the kind of personal integrity it takes to say &quot;I can&#39;t do well by all my kids&quot; and then look for alternatives. I know families who have gone from unschooling to homeschooling because mom struggles with depression or illness or other disability and homeschooling helps them stay more focused on the needs of their children. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2. Is this what we want to pass on to our children, do it well or you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; not doing anything at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>On the one hand, it helped me to step back from the idea of the &quot;good mother&quot; as that idea is, in my mind, tied to a whole lot of baggage. But at the same time, it has always been important to me to be a Competent parent.

Is it not just someone&#39;s individual<br/>\nchoice/action?****<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen someone is a member of a minority group, or a subculture, or any sort<br/>\nof non-mainstream/non-majority grouping, that someone runs into the reality<br/>\nof the mainstream looking at their individual character and actions as<br/>\nrepresentative of their sub-group as a whole.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t just an Unschooling Thing - it happens with race, ethnicity,<br/>\nsexuality, ability/disability, gender, religion, etc.  One person of a<br/>\nsubgroup is often assumed by society to represent the entire subgroup, even<br/>\nthough this is in many ways faulty thinking.  I am female, but I do not<br/>\nrepresent Women with my individual views.  However if I&#39;m in a<br/>\nmale-dominated situation I might be looked at that way.  My husband is<br/>\nCuban, but he does not represent Cubans with his day to day life - he&#39;s<br/>\nsimply a person.  But if he&#39;s in a gathering with no other Cubans, speaking<br/>\nhis mind, those non-Cubans might well think his political views, for<br/>\nexample, are Cuban Views - even though, again, that&#39;s not realistic.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly, unschoolers are homeschoolers.  Homeschoolers are a<br/>\nnon-mainstream group in that we do not represent the majority in any country<br/>\nI know of in terms of how we choose to educate our children (at home).  When<br/>\nthose who are part of mainstream educational culture look at us, it is<br/>\nsimple to chalk poor behavior or poor social skills or unkempt appearance or<br/>\na thousand other things up to the fact that we homeschool.  This isn&#39;t<br/>\nnecessarily true - when my son doesn&#39;t want to take a shower before going<br/>\nout, it&#39;s not because he&#39;s a homeschooler :-)  But at the same time, the<br/>\nreality is that if we&#39;re going out in public, it&#39;s important he be clean so<br/>\nas *not* to stand as someone to point fingers at as &quot;one of THOSE people.&quot;<br/>\nNot because it&#39;s Fair that the world acts that way - but because it&#39;s Real.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly, unschoolers behaving poorly in public (being destructive, for<br/>\nexample) can easily be pointed out by the mainstream to be doing that<br/>\n*because* they are unschoolers.  Not necessarily true in each individual<br/>\ncase - but it&#39;s something for the mainstream to point out and shake fingers<br/>\nat.  Not necessarily Fair, again - but just Real.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yes, by being unschoolers, in my opinion, if we identify ourselves as<br/>\nsuch and then behave poorly in public, we do reflect poorly on others who<br/>\nalso identify as unschoolers.  Not Fair - but Real.<br/>\n<br/>\nColleen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":239743660,"authorName":"Nadine Toppozada","from":"Nadine Toppozada &lt;ntoppozada@...&gt;","profile":"ntoppozada","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling badly","postDate":"1352734301","msgId":69612,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBTzM0ekZhPXhXYW9zaEJKQjNrX1BLUlQyUC04U2RaYzI4QkYtX1NDVD1RUl94N25VUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":69610,"nextInTopic":69613,"prevInTime":69611,"nextInTime":69613,"topicId":69610,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Someone there had written that anyone can unschool.  Meredith objected.  I was glad she had.   Here&#39;s what I wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________<br/>\nThere are many people whose fluffy feel-good rhetoric includes &quot;anyone can unschool.&quot; The problem with that is that there are eople who think saying &quot;Ok! Then I am an unschooler&quot; is the same as becoming an unschooler. It&#39;s not that simple and it&#39;s not that easy. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf unschooling is not done well, it&#39;s not being done at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnytime a family calls doing nothing &quot;unschooling,&quot; or is neglectful and lazy and says &quot;that&#39;s because we&#39;re unschoolers,&quot; it&#39;s not good for their family, and it reflects badly on all other unschoolers. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have no interest in helping other people made bad decisions and get stuck in a place they can&#39;t get out of. I AM willing to help other people understand unschooling in ways that help them do it well, and I&#39;ve been doing that for a long time.<br/>\n_________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not that I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a place for feel-good rhetoric.  For me, it&#39;s Just Add Light and Stir !<br/>\nIn case there&#39;s anyone here who doesn&#39;t subscribe to that, it&#39;s here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com\">http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPeople who make changes in their lives and beliefs in order to focus on their children&#39;s peaceful lives of learning become happier.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe people who will NOT become happier are those who think they don&#39;t need to change anything,  who choose NOT to focus on learning, because they vaguely think someone said that kids learn all the time, so the parents don&#39;t need to do anything about that, or who choose not to focus on peaceful lives because they like drama and self-righteous indignation.   Those are not things to support or encourage.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is possible to screw it up.  One way to fail to unschool is to think that saying &quot;We&#39;re unschoolers&quot; is enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69645,"nextTopicId":69671}}
