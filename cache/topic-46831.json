If you don&#39;t know what to compare your kids&#39;  <br/>\nwriting to, it might be easier to worry.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut to be fair, I write easily.  My kids are easily verbal.   <br/>\nUndoubtedly there&#39;s an element of &quot;verbal intelligence&quot; (Howard  <br/>\nGardner term) involved.  Genetics.

Marty, genetically more like his dad, has not  <br/>\ninquired about these subtle details of written English.  But when  <br/>\nKeith was Marty&#39;s age he wasn&#39;t much of a writer either, though he had  <br/>\nfinished high school and two years at the university.
