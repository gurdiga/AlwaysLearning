When they wanted to learn songs I ordered Mrs Stewart&#39;s<br/>\npiano lessons from www.fun-books.com, mostly because of John Holt&#39;s<br/>\ntestimonial.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe unique thing about this program is that different scales are<br/>\nlearned only by interval and fingering, not specifically by note name.<br/>\n I had a terrible memory for note names and always struggled with the<br/>\n&quot;hard&quot; keys (what&#39;s sharp? what&#39;s flat? ack).  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn helping the kids get started with playing numbered songs in this<br/>\nprogram I learned something I didn&#39;t consciously realize (or at least,<br/>\ndid not consciously remember) despite my 13 years of playing:  when<br/>\nyou set the supplied cardboard fingering template over the keys, no<br/>\nmatter which starting note finger 1 goes on, the interval between that<br/>\nand finger 2, 3, 4, etc., is the same.  So by moving the template<br/>\nalong the keyboard the children (and I!) could play any of the<br/>\nsupplied songs in any key, even the &quot;hard&quot; keys.  We spent hours over<br/>\nseveral days playing the songs (all numbered keys) in multiple keys. <br/>\nThere&#39;s a template for bass clef chord accompaniments, too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe haven&#39;t worked through the &quot;lesson&quot; part of the program, but the<br/>\nkids really enjoy playing in the song book (I wouldn&#39;t have understood<br/>\nthe song book without the lesson book which has the fingering<br/>\ntemplates).

Baby #4 is due  <br/>\nto arrive in August. We live in extreme southeastern South Dakota.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrowing up, I took traditional piano lessons (scales, chords,  <br/>\nrequired practices, etc.) for 12 years. We&#39;ve always had an upright  <br/>\npiano in our house (one that survived the fallfrom the back of the  <br/>\ntruck onto the highway as we were bringing it home), and Accalia  <br/>\nstarted showing interest in playing it two or three years ago. She  <br/>\nwould ask me how to play certain songs and wanted me to write them  <br/>\ndown for her. Since she didn&#39;t know how to read music, I put  <br/>\ndifferent colored stickers on the keys and copied that color code on  <br/>\nto a piece of paper. Then it seemed to transition to where she&#39;d ask  <br/>\nme to write down songs for her using numbers (not proper fingering  <br/>\nbut the order of the notes starting with Middle C as &quot;1&quot;. We had our  <br/>\nown code figured out for sharps, flats, bass clef and octaves higher  <br/>\nthan that first one. Again it transitioned to where she started  <br/>\nasking me to write down songs using the names of the notes, and  <br/>\nthat&#39;s what she does now. I&#39;ve also seen (and heard) her playing new  <br/>\nsongs from the various books we have, so she&#39;s also started to pick  <br/>\nup on reading notes. One of her favorite things to do is to sit at  <br/>\nthe piano and compose her own songs, writing them down to keep in a  <br/>\nfolder.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Accalia would ever ask to take piano lessons, it&#39;s certainly  <br/>\nsomething we&#39;d be glad to let her try, but I can&#39;t imagine what  <br/>\nbenefit she would have had taking lessons from the start when she&#39;s  <br/>\nbeen playing what she wants to from the very beginning. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy<br/>\nMama to Accalia (6/14/99), Cole (9/03/02), Ella (10/29/05) and baby  <br/>\nEDD 8/19/08<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thissideofsomewhere.blogspot.com/\">http://thissideofsomewhere.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We want the spring to come and the winter to pass.

Not<br/>\n&gt; only that, but I was able to benefit from what others shared about their own<br/>\n&gt; unschooling experiences. Nowhere in my post did I mention anything about<br/>\n&gt; wanting information on how to &quot;teach&quot; my daughter. I only asked for simple<br/>\n&gt; book & sheet music suggestions. Not knowing I&#39;d have to defend my request<br/>\n&gt; with all the why&#39;s & why not&#39;s about my family&#39;s personal business in order<br/>\n&gt; to get a kind and helpful response,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re at all familiar with the vibe of this list, you know the most of<br/>\nus who post share the whys and why nots and our family&#39;s &quot;personal business&quot;<br/>\nin order for the advice-givers to know the context out of which we are<br/>\nasking for perspective. (i.e. knowing Hayden&#39;s dad has died, allows those<br/>\nwho might say &quot;what about dad?&quot; to know it&#39;s not applicable to us)<br/>\n<br/>\nI find too, the advice I immediately label as unkind or unhelpful sits with<br/>\nme much longer than the statements that make me say &quot;oh yeah, I&#39;m right&quot;...<br/>\nthe longer I sit with the uncomfortable ideas, the more I realize *those*<br/>\nare the ones that are gonna force me to shift my perspective. I try them on<br/>\nlike a new shirt and see how they fit... more times than not, the painful<br/>\nadvice becomes the BEST advice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but the reason I am asking for simple books is because my daughter happens<br/>\n&gt; to love books and she loves learning from books. Because she&#39;s so proud of<br/>\n&gt; herself for having taught herself to read, she wants to read books about<br/>\n&gt; learning to play the piano. Go figure that it&#39;s now my mission to find her<br/>\n&gt; some.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s also your mission to show her the world *beyond* books (i.e. Kelli&#39;s<br/>\npost about her daughters) that there is an infinite supply of information<br/>\n*elsewhere* as well. That&#39;s the nudge you&#39;re feeling.<br/>\n<br/>\n(snip)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Would you shun the very idea of books and classes just because they&#39;re not<br/>\n&gt; &quot;unschooly&quot; enough, therefore depriving your child of possibly discovering<br/>\n&gt; another way to learn just because *you* disapprove of it? How sad.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Are you rejecting advice to open your world (and your view of *teaching* and<br/>\n*learning from books*) because you disapprove of Sandra&#39;s tone??  Rhetorical<br/>\nquestion, one to chew on...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do you even question whether my daughter *wants* to take piano lessons<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; or not? I feel that your questioning her desire is insulting to me. Of<br/>\n&gt; course she wants to take lessons. We, like most unschoolers I know, allow<br/>\n&gt; our children to direct their own education.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You didn&#39;t answer the question when it was asked. I was waiting to give<br/>\nadvice based on your answer to that question. Is your daughter (at 5)<br/>\nconvinced she needs a teacher and a book to be able to play piano?  It&#39;s a<br/>\nvaluable question and it helps give us insight into your thought process so<br/>\nthe advice is applicable to you. I can&#39;t see how helping us to custom tailor<br/>\nour responses is a bad thing...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Again, your questioning of my use of the word &quot;impossible&quot; is extremely<br/>\n&gt; insulting and downright haughty. Why do you assume that you can talk to<br/>\n&gt; people that way? You do not even know me. I am aware of how I use my words,<br/>\n&gt; and &quot;impossible&quot; was the word I intended to use. It *is* impossible to take<br/>\n&gt; her 50 miles away to a piano lesson when gas and the lessons themselves<br/>\n&gt; might compromise our having groceries for the rest of our family or paying<br/>\n&gt; our bills that month. There are such things as financial obligations. And it<br/>\n&gt; just so happens Ms. Dodd, that our daughter does need Physical Therapy,<br/>\n&gt; Speech Therapy, and Occupational Therapy, three days a week for which we<br/>\n&gt; drive an hour to and an hour from for one hour of each therapy, every single<br/>\n&gt; week. We also drive her forty minutes away for ballet classes every week.<br/>\n&gt; Maybe you need to look at your own definition of &quot;impossible&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Shifting one&#39;s thought processes away from *impossible* to *POSSIBLE* is a<br/>\nhuge step in understanding, not only unschooling, but life itself. It&#39;s a<br/>\ntough one, I know, I&#39;m there on a regular basis. i.e. I would LOVE to say to<br/>\nmy son &quot;It&#39;s impossible for us to get a dog&quot; because I don&#39;t want to do the<br/>\nwork involved in us becoming dog owners. Because I&#39;m deeply committed to<br/>\nwhat&#39;s important in his life, I&#39;ve forced myself (yes it was a forceful<br/>\nnudge that made me horrifically uncomfortable) to see what *is* possible and<br/>\nhow to shift our life to create an opening for a dog. I&#39;ve had to face the<br/>\nfears that have been quieted by my *impossible* thinking, when I shifted to<br/>\n*possible* I had to one-by-one address those fears and send them packing.<br/>\nYour above paragraph, in which I think you&#39;re defending your right to saying<br/>\n*impossible,* shows that you&#39;re already doing things that are seemingly<br/>\n*impossible* by your own definition.<br/>\nI&#39;ve yet to find one unschooling family without financial obligations. What<br/>\nI see are lots of families uninhibited by limitations when their passions<br/>\nrequire they do so.<br/>\nI spent the past 7 years as a single parent on a small monthly stipend.<br/>\nSingle mamas everywhere find it *impossible* to do lots of thing with their<br/>\nkids that I found absolutely *POSSIBLE* (i.e. cross-country travels,<br/>\nconferences, gaming equipment, etc) because I choose to see life this way.<br/>\nIt really *is* all about perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\n(snipped the diatribe)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Personally, I don&#39;t subscribe here to hear folks whine about Sandra (I think<br/>\nthere are actual lists who have that as their purpose, I don&#39;t go there<br/>\neither).

Again, that&#39;s the purpose of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the oher hand, when I read your reply to Sandra, I could see your<br/>\n&gt; initial reaction was defensive but trying to be friendly. Then I saw<br/>\n&gt; your words slowly work themself into a state of frustration, anger<br/>\n&gt; and defense. Which shows me that everything you said in the beginning<br/>\n&gt; (the thank you&#39;s) was all for show and once you got on a roll, your<br/>\n&gt; real emotions came out, which was that you were offended.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There is nothing wrong with your feeling what you felt. But here is<br/>\n&gt; something I&#39;ve learned from these groups. When I am offended by<br/>\n&gt; something a *stranger* did or said, I need to examine &quot;Why&quot;. Why did<br/>\n&gt; that comment or remark from a complete stranger affect me that way?<br/>\n&gt; Usually (maybe even always) it has to do with me; my issue and my<br/>\n&gt; defensiveness when they held up that mirror. When this happens, I<br/>\n&gt; usually take a day...or several days...to allow what they<br/>\n&gt; said/did/wrote to sink in. I examine my feelings toward it, allow<br/>\n&gt; myself to question its validity and then I go back and reread it.<br/>\n&gt; Everytime I reread it, it doesn&#39;t seem as rude or offensive as I<br/>\n&gt; first thought. That&#39;s how I know it&#39;s *me*; their comment struck a<br/>\n&gt; chord in me that I wasn&#39;t ready to see.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would venture to say the same thing for you. Judging by the way you<br/>\n&gt; wrote, I was surprised to see you say you had been unschooling &quot;for<br/>\n&gt; years&quot;. That wasn&#39;t the impression I got at all. Therefore I would be<br/>\n&gt; so bold as to say that the reason you felt offended over Sandra&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; comments were simply the fact that she held up a mirror; maybe she<br/>\n&gt; even showed you that your desire for your daughter to learn piano was<br/>\n&gt; *your* desire and not your daughter&#39;s. Maybe she showed you, as an<br/>\n&gt; unschooler, that what you were doing was harmful more than helpful to<br/>\n&gt; your unschooling. I don&#39;t know.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But I - and most everyone here - does know that many, many people<br/>\n&gt; come on these boards thinking they get it, thinking they are full-<br/>\n&gt; fledged unschoolers, when they really don&#39;t get it. Or they really do<br/>\n&gt; get it but are ignoring it to accomplish what they want. And since<br/>\n&gt; these boards are here to help people &quot;get it&quot; and since we only have<br/>\n&gt; your descriptions to go off of, we&#39;re going to take your words at<br/>\n&gt; face value which sometimes looks to us like you don&#39;t get it, and<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;re going to do what we&#39;re here to do, which is help you &quot;get it&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What else can we do? It&#39;s kind of hard to presume something other<br/>\n&gt; than what is stated...and to not help would make this board useless.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One more thing: I was one of those people who was &quot;offended&quot; by<br/>\n&gt; Sandra awhile back.

Just <br/>\nanother perspective to contrast agianst your own. You are free to <br/>\ntake it or leave it, but I hope that you will read this as coming <br/>\nfrom a caring place. (In other words, if it offends you, please try <br/>\nrereading it with the assumption that my tone is nicer than you <br/>\noriginally presumed.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I read Sandra&#39;s response, I in no way saw anything rude, <br/>\ninsulting or downright haughty. I saw Sandra sticking to the purpose <br/>\nof this group, which is for us as parents to learn about natural <br/>\nlearning and to learn how natural learning applies to our home. <br/>\n<br/>\nI saw nothing that said that what you&#39;re doing is wrong. She simply <br/>\nstuck to the subject of this group - natural learning - and asked you <br/>\nto do the same. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf my 8yr old decides he wants to learn multiplication, I know this <br/>\nis not the group to come for. There are other groups/resources for <br/>\nthat. This group is to help me understand my child and the way he <br/>\ngrows. Again, that&#39;s the purpose of this group.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the oher hand, when I read your reply to Sandra, I could see your <br/>\ninitial reaction was defensive but trying to be friendly. Then I saw <br/>\nyour words slowly work themself into a state of frustration, anger <br/>\nand defense. Which shows me that everything you said in the beginning <br/>\n(the thank you&#39;s) was all for show and once you got on a roll, your <br/>\nreal emotions came out, which was that you were offended. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is nothing wrong with your feeling what you felt. But here is <br/>\nsomething I&#39;ve learned from these groups. When I am offended by <br/>\nsomething a *stranger* did or said, I need to examine &quot;Why&quot;. Why did <br/>\nthat comment or remark from a complete stranger affect me that way? <br/>\nUsually (maybe even always) it has to do with me; my issue and my <br/>\ndefensiveness when they held up that mirror. When this happens, I <br/>\nusually take a day...or several days...to allow what they <br/>\nsaid/did/wrote to sink in. I examine my feelings toward it, allow <br/>\nmyself to question its validity and then I go back and reread it. <br/>\nEverytime I reread it, it doesn&#39;t seem as rude or offensive as I <br/>\nfirst thought. That&#39;s how I know it&#39;s *me*; their comment struck a <br/>\nchord in me that I wasn&#39;t ready to see.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would venture to say the same thing for you. Judging by the way you <br/>\nwrote, I was surprised to see you say you had been unschooling &quot;for <br/>\nyears&quot;. That wasn&#39;t the impression I got at all. Therefore I would be <br/>\nso bold as to say that the reason you felt offended over Sandra&#39;s <br/>\ncomments were simply the fact that she held up a mirror; maybe she <br/>\neven showed you that your desire for your daughter to learn piano was <br/>\n*your* desire and not your daughter&#39;s. Maybe she showed you, as an <br/>\nunschooler, that what you were doing was harmful more than helpful to <br/>\nyour unschooling. I don&#39;t know. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I - and most everyone here - does know that many, many people <br/>\ncome on these boards thinking they get it, thinking they are full-<br/>\nfledged unschoolers, when they really don&#39;t get it. Or they really do <br/>\nget it but are ignoring it to accomplish what they want. And since <br/>\nthese boards are here to help people &quot;get it&quot; and since we only have <br/>\nyour descriptions to go off of, we&#39;re going to take your words at <br/>\nface value which sometimes looks to us like you don&#39;t get it, and <br/>\nwe&#39;re going to do what we&#39;re here to do, which is help you &quot;get it&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat else can we do? It&#39;s kind of hard to presume something other <br/>\nthan what is stated...and to not help would make this board useless.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more thing: I was one of those people who was &quot;offended&quot; by <br/>\nSandra awhile back. That&#39;s because she is upfront and honest and <br/>\nimmediately holds up a mirror and I wasn&#39;t used to that nor was I <br/>\nready to see what the reflection staring back at me.

Having said this, I&#39;m not exactly sure what the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; problem is with my post. I am still unclear as to why it is considered wrong<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to cross post to this list...? I have to disagree with your statement:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;This wasn&#39;t a good list to come to for advice on &quot;teaching.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; On the contrary, this was a wonderful list to come to for advice. Look at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; how many kind and very helpful replies I received compared to yours. Not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; only that, but I was able to benefit from what others shared about their own<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unschooling experiences. Nowhere in my post did I mention anything about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wanting information on how to &quot;teach&quot; my daughter. I only asked for simple<br/>\n&gt; &gt; book & sheet music suggestions. Not knowing I&#39;d have to defend my request<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with all the why&#39;s & why not&#39;s about my family&#39;s personal business in order<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to get a kind and helpful response, but the reason I am asking for simple<br/>\n&gt; &gt; books is because my daughter happens to love books and she loves learning<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from books. Because she&#39;s so proud of herself for having taught herself to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; read, she wants to read books about learning to play the piano. Go figure<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that it&#39;s now my mission to find her some.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I received some very helpful, wonderful feedback within just hours of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sending my post for which I am very grateful for, from people on this list<br/>\n&gt; &gt; who seemed very happy to help me. Those moms seem to get what I am after,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but it seems that you don&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I was unaware that being an unschooler meant totally shunning books for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; any purpose! I have been on this and other unschooling lists for quite<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sometime, we belong to unschooling support groups, we go to unschooling<br/>\n&gt; &gt; conferences, and we have considered ours to be an unschooling family for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; years. I do not need a lesson in unschooling. Our, and it seems many other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; families&#39; definition of unschooling includes obtaining whatever the child<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wants or needs to learn what she wants to learn. Strange as it may seem,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that may include books, and even classes from time to time. Would you shun<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the very idea of books and classes just because they&#39;re not &quot;unschooly&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; enough, therefore depriving your child of possibly discovering another way<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to learn just because *you* disapprove of it? How sad.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Why do you even question whether my daughter *wants* to take piano lessons<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or not? I feel that your questioning her desire is insulting to me. Of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; course she wants to take lessons. We, like most unschoolers I know, allow<br/>\n&gt; &gt; our children to direct their own education.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Again, your questioning of my use of the word &quot;impossible&quot; is extremely<br/>\n&gt; &gt; insulting and downright haughty. Why do you assume that you can talk to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people that way? You do not even know me. I am aware of how I use my words,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and &quot;impossible&quot; was the word I intended to use. It *is* impossible to take<br/>\n&gt; &gt; her 50 miles away to a piano lesson when gas and the lessons themselves<br/>\n&gt; &gt; might compromise our having groceries for the rest of our family or paying<br/>\n&gt; &gt; our bills that month. There are such things as financial obligations. And it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just so happens Ms. Dodd, that our daughter does need Physical Therapy,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Speech Therapy, and Occupational Therapy, three days a week for which we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; drive an hour to and an hour from for one hour of each therapy, every single<br/>\n&gt; &gt; week. We also drive her forty minutes away for ballet classes every week.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Maybe you need to look at your own definition of &quot;impossible&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And since you think I&#39;m so dumb, apparently you had to point out the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; obvious resources for Spanish lessons too. It probably never occured to you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that someone so dumb as I would have not only tried those options but that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; our book-loving family would appreciate the extra help from books as well.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I can&#39;t believe that I was so foolish as not to run directly to your blog<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for instructions on how to unschool my children. I didn&#39;t know I was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; breaking the &quot;rules&quot; of unschooling, and I&#39;m so glad you took the time out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of your day to point them out to me. Thanks also, for posting your rude<br/>\n&gt; &gt; response so that everyone could see it instead of emailing me privately. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wonder if you will have the guts to do the same.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I do not think that I want to be on a list with such an elitist view of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unschooling. Such a limited point of view can&#39;t be healthy. I am not saying<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that all the members are like this, because that is most certainly not the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; case.

Sandra&#39;s house  <br/>\neven has a real library, to say nothing of books in the bathrooms,  <br/>\nbedrooms, common spaces, and every other room. Nothing in Sandra&#39;s  <br/>\nresponse said: &quot;shun books.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2 Your post to ask for advice was perfectly appropriate for this  <br/>\n&gt; board.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>First, this is Sandra&#39;s list and she can decide for herself what is  <br/>\nappropriate for her own list. She&#39;s generously spending her time  <br/>\npaying attention to it and making sure it sticks to her purpose in  <br/>\nproviding it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, the original post was written from a school-at-home  <br/>\nperspective, not an unschooling mindset. &quot;We have been wanting to give  <br/>\nour five-year-old daughter piano lessons for some time.&quot; The child is  <br/>\nonly five, but they have wanted to do this for her for some time and  <br/>\nhave already tried classes at a couple of different places.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was not a single comment in the entire post about what the five- <br/>\nyear-old wanted, how she felt, what she was doing or saying to  <br/>\nindicate she&#39;d like formal lessons or classes.  &quot;We tried classes...&quot;.  <br/>\nWho is the &quot;we?&quot; Mother and father and daughter tried them together?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might point to this and think it means she is saying her daughter  <br/>\nis asking for piano lessons..<br/>\n  &quot;(My background is in guitar & voice, so of course my daughter is  <br/>\ninterested in piano)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  But that sounds like what we hear from people who are insisting on  <br/>\nmusic lessons of some kind, but letting the child choose what kind of  <br/>\nmusic she wants to study.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd (of course?) she chose piano because that was not what the mother  <br/>\ndoes. Why &quot;of course?&quot; Sarcasm? A comment about how children are  <br/>\ntypically perverse in their choices? Again, NOT an unschooling  <br/>\nperspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was NOTHING in that post to indicate that the child really wants  <br/>\nthis. Nothing saying what the child is currently doing to show that  <br/>\nshe has the desire. No reason given for why they want to give formal  <br/>\nlessons, using a structured curriculum. No request for any OTHER ideas  <br/>\nfor ways they could support a five-year-old&#39;s musical interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, added to that, she also wants a Spanish language curriculum  <br/>\n(books to teach out of for ages 5 through high school) so that they  <br/>\ncan &quot;teach at home.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, nothing wrong with books. Nothing wrong with USING books. The  <br/>\nproblem with this post is that the writer didn&#39;t come looking for ways  <br/>\nto support her daughter&#39;s deep interest in learning to play the piano  <br/>\nor learning to speak Spanish  - she is coming to an unschooling  <br/>\ndiscussion list, but just asking for structured lesson plans for  <br/>\nteaching her five-year-old child at home.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; and 3 Sandra never stated what could possibly be wrong with cross- <br/>\n&gt; posting<br/>\n&gt; your request for advice.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It wasn&#39;t a request for unschooling advice. It was a request for  <br/>\n&quot;teach-at-home&quot; curricular materials. The problem with cross-posting  <br/>\nis that the various lists are not interchangeable - to post the same  <br/>\nrequest to different lists means you&#39;re not considering the unique  <br/>\nnature of each list and it means the posts are generic. That post  <br/>\ncould have just as easily gone to a list called, &quot;Teaching Kids What  <br/>\nThey Need to Know&quot; or the &quot;How to Get Kids to Learn What We Want Them  <br/>\nto Learn&quot; list.

Having said this, I&#39;m not exactly sure what the<br/>\n&gt; problem is with my post. I am still unclear as to why it is considered wrong<br/>\n&gt; to cross post to this list...? I have to disagree with your statement:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;This wasn&#39;t a good list to come to for advice on &quot;teaching.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the contrary, this was a wonderful list to come to for advice. Look at<br/>\n&gt; how many kind and very helpful replies I received compared to yours. Not<br/>\n&gt; only that, but I was able to benefit from what others shared about their own<br/>\n&gt; unschooling experiences. Nowhere in my post did I mention anything about<br/>\n&gt; wanting information on how to &quot;teach&quot; my daughter. I only asked for simple<br/>\n&gt; book & sheet music suggestions. Not knowing I&#39;d have to defend my request<br/>\n&gt; with all the why&#39;s & why not&#39;s about my family&#39;s personal business in order<br/>\n&gt; to get a kind and helpful response, but the reason I am asking for simple<br/>\n&gt; books is because my daughter happens to love books and she loves learning<br/>\n&gt; from books. Because she&#39;s so proud of herself for having taught herself to<br/>\n&gt; read, she wants to read books about learning to play the piano. Go figure<br/>\n&gt; that it&#39;s now my mission to find her some.<br/>\n&gt; I received some very helpful, wonderful feedback within just hours of<br/>\n&gt; sending my post for which I am very grateful for, from people on this list<br/>\n&gt; who seemed very happy to help me. Those moms seem to get what I am after,<br/>\n&gt; but it seems that you don&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt; I was unaware that being an unschooler meant totally shunning books for<br/>\n&gt; any purpose! I have been on this and other unschooling lists for quite<br/>\n&gt; sometime, we belong to unschooling support groups, we go to unschooling<br/>\n&gt; conferences, and we have considered ours to be an unschooling family for<br/>\n&gt; years. I do not need a lesson in unschooling. Our, and it seems many other<br/>\n&gt; families&#39; definition of unschooling includes obtaining whatever the child<br/>\n&gt; wants or needs to learn what she wants to learn. Strange as it may seem,<br/>\n&gt; that may include books, and even classes from time to time. Would you shun<br/>\n&gt; the very idea of books and classes just because they&#39;re not &quot;unschooly&quot;<br/>\n&gt; enough, therefore depriving your child of possibly discovering another way<br/>\n&gt; to learn just because *you* disapprove of it? How sad.<br/>\n&gt; Why do you even question whether my daughter *wants* to take piano lessons<br/>\n&gt; or not? I feel that your questioning her desire is insulting to me. Of<br/>\n&gt; course she wants to take lessons. We, like most unschoolers I know, allow<br/>\n&gt; our children to direct their own education.<br/>\n&gt; Again, your questioning of my use of the word &quot;impossible&quot; is extremely<br/>\n&gt; insulting and downright haughty. Why do you assume that you can talk to<br/>\n&gt; people that way? You do not even know me. I am aware of how I use my words,<br/>\n&gt; and &quot;impossible&quot; was the word I intended to use. It *is* impossible to take<br/>\n&gt; her 50 miles away to a piano lesson when gas and the lessons themselves<br/>\n&gt; might compromise our having groceries for the rest of our family or paying<br/>\n&gt; our bills that month. There are such things as financial obligations.

Yours, like everyone else&#39;s are very much appreciated as I brought up this question to this list and other unschooling lists to get the support from other unschooling families like ourselves.  Having said this, I&#39;m not exactly sure what the problem is with my post.  I am still unclear as to why it is considered wrong to cross post to this list...?  I have to disagree with your statement:<br/>\n   <br/>\n  &quot;This wasn&#39;t a good list to come to for advice on &quot;teaching.&quot; <br/>\n    <br/>\n      On the contrary, this was a wonderful list to come to for advice.  Look at how many kind and very helpful replies I received compared to yours.   Not only that, but I was able to benefit from what others shared about their own unschooling experiences.  Nowhere in my post did I mention anything about wanting information on how to &quot;teach&quot; my daughter.  I only asked for simple book & sheet music suggestions.  Not knowing I&#39;d have to defend my request with all the why&#39;s & why not&#39;s about my family&#39;s personal business in order to get a kind and helpful response, but the reason I am asking for simple books is because my daughter happens to love books and she loves learning from books.  Because she&#39;s so proud of herself for having  taught herself to read, she wants to read books about learning to play the piano.  Go figure that it&#39;s now my mission to find her some.   <br/>\n      I received some very helpful, wonderful feedback within just hours of sending my post for which I am very grateful for, from people on this list who seemed very happy to help me.  Those moms seem to get what I am after, but it seems that you don&#39;t.<br/>\n      I was unaware that being an unschooler meant totally shunning books for any purpose!  I have been on this and other unschooling lists for quite sometime, we belong to unschooling support groups, we go to unschooling conferences, and we have considered ours to be an unschooling family for years.  I do not need a lesson in unschooling.  Our, and it seems many other families&#39; definition of unschooling includes obtaining whatever the child wants or needs to learn what she wants to learn.  Strange as it may seem, that may include books, and even classes from time to time.  Would you shun the very idea of books and classes just because they&#39;re not &quot;unschooly&quot; enough, therefore depriving your child of possibly discovering another way to learn just because *you* disapprove of it?  How sad.<br/>\n     Why do you even question whether my daughter *wants* to take piano lessons or not?  I feel that your questioning her desire is insulting to me.  Of course she wants to take lessons.  We, like most unschoolers I know, allow our children to direct their own education.   <br/>\n      Again, your questioning of my use of the word &quot;impossible&quot; is extremely insulting and downright haughty.  Why do you assume that you can talk to people that way?  You do not even know me.  I am aware of how I use my words, and &quot;impossible&quot; was the word I intended to use.  It *is* impossible to take her 50 miles away to a piano lesson when gas and the lessons themselves might compromise our having groceries for the rest of our family or paying our bills that month.   There are such things as financial obligations.   And it just so happens Ms. Dodd, that our daughter does need Physical Therapy, Speech Therapy, and Occupational Therapy, three days a week for which we drive an hour to and an hour from for one hour of each therapy, every single week.  We also drive her forty minutes away for ballet classes every week.  Maybe you need to look at your own definition of &quot;impossible&quot;.<br/>\n      And since you think I&#39;m so dumb, apparently you had to point out the obvious resources for Spanish lessons too.  It probably never occured to you that someone so dumb as I would have not only tried those options but that our book-loving family would appreciate the extra help from books as well.  <br/>\n      I can&#39;t believe that I was so foolish as not to run directly to your blog for instructions on how to unschool my children.

For the last 3 or 4 years my girls have been playing the piano.  About 2 years ago they decided they were going to try piano lessons.  We had some friends who were taking from this woman so we thought we&#39;d try.   Well,  we went once and the girls were so put off that they didn&#39;t want to go again.  The teacher was very rigid and seemed to get upset if they wanted to ask questions for longer than she wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was when Abbi was 11 and Kyra was 8.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThey did continue to play the piano but I could see that just the one week of me mentioning practicing had an effect on their excitement.  I kept the lesson books but they haven&#39;t really liked them.  The music is too boring to them.  They&#39;d rather play songs they know.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow in this last year Abbi has really taken off in playing.  She wanted to play Mad World after hearing it in the movie Donnie Darko..... so she did. :)   I helped her find it online and we printed it out.  Then she also wanted to learn some Final Fantasy music that she liked from the Final Fantasy video games.  She now plays that really well too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt pretty much went like this:  We&#39;d look for the music. Google it or in music stores.  I&#39;d look for one that isn&#39;t too complex but still had some nice sounds.  I&#39;d play through it, she&#39;d watch me,  I would play parts out and she would copy it.   That&#39;s how she learned Mad World.  Some by ear and some by memorizing what she saw me do.  With the Final Fantasy song (to Zanarkland) we started that way but then it actually turned into her reading music.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI had printed out some music notation that labels the keys on a piano and the notes; how they correspond.  She found that and sat one evening for, I bet, 3-4 hours learning the names of the notes.  She now can read music.  She is 13 now.<br/>\n<br/>\nKyra, now 10, still plays.  But she hasn&#39;t really wanted to spend the amount of time it takes to learn it the way Abbi decided she wanted to.  I&#39;m sure Kyra will too if she feels like it&#39;s that important to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do play the piano, and obviously that helps,  but if I didn&#39;t I guess what I would look for is someone who would be just willing to sit with your child and answer questions about the piano or music or songs that they would like to learn.  I guess a REALLY flexible piano teacher might do this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d be really careful about trying to stick to learning with the lesson books.  That can just drive all the fun right out of music playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis whole process has been amazing for me since it has been so different from how I learned.  I started piano at age 7 and played until I was 18.  Taking lessons the whole time.   I never felt like I was very good and questioned why I was playing... continually..  the girls play because they want to :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a video of Abbi playing the Final Fantasy song on my blog if you&#39;d like to check it out:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ourjoyfullife.blogspot.com/2007/11/to-zanarkand-piano.html\">http://ourjoyfullife.blogspot.com/2007/11/to-zanarkand-piano.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I really liked an essay written by Mark Douglas which is in _Deschooling Our Lives_ by Matt Hern.

We have tried classes at a couple of <br/>\ndifferent places and the one where we had the most luck was where <br/>\nthe teacher based the lessons on fun & actually learning to play <br/>\nsongs first, instead of rote memorization, scales, or reading <br/>\ndrills, which I personally believe kills the desire to learn about <br/>\nmusic.  Unfortunately, that school is quite a distance away from us <br/>\nand it was impossible to continue lessons because of that distance.  <br/>\nWe have kept our eyes open for similarly suitable teachers, but have <br/>\nnot found any that fit what we hope to find.  Also, lessons have <br/>\nbecome extremely expensive these days and I just can&#39;t see ourselves <br/>\nshelling out so much money for a half an hour lesson without feeling <br/>\nripped off.  <br/>\n    I have a beginner&#39;s knowledge of piano (My background is in <br/>\nguitar & voice, so of course my daughter is interested in piano), so <br/>\nI have decided that it might be in our best interests to teach her <br/>\nwhat I know, myself.  So I am looking for a good book to use to <br/>\nteach her that is simple, and based on fun and being able to <br/>\nactually play something right away.  Perhaps someone can recommend <br/>\nsuch a book?  Also, can anyone recommend some good beginner&#39;s sheet <br/>\nmusic that would be appropriate for 5-7 year olds?<br/>\nI hope that someone can recommend some good titles!
