Men&#39;s instincts have to do with providing shelter and resources.  Women&#39;s have to do with keeping peace and order.  Because people have moved around and intermarried and made extreme changes in cultures out of conscious decision, and we have millions of people around us instead of a small tribe or a village with a clear hierarchy, things go wonky.<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<br/>\n\r<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65858,"nextTopicId":65910}}
