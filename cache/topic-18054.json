Thanks in advance for any and all tips/feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI knew this knowledge would come in handy some day!  I had a friend in high<br/>\nschool who often dyed her hair with Kool-Aid.  She used two to three packets<br/>\n(depending on how dark she wanted it) of the unsweetened Kool-Aid powder.<br/>\nShe dissolved it in 2 quarts of warm vinegar.  Warm the hair first by taking<br/>\na warm shower (opens up the hair to receive the dye) then soak the parts of<br/>\nthe hair you want dyed for about 15-20 minutes.  If you want all of it dyed<br/>\nwith no roots showing fill a bowl with the mixture and tip your head back<br/>\ninto it.  The color lasted for about three weeks.  I think a color like red<br/>\nor purple would look great on top of already darkened (i.e. with henna)<br/>\nhair.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the non-toxic part, I am not sure how I would classify the coloring<br/>\nagents in Kool-Aid FD &C #6 etc. but at least you know they are safe enough<br/>\nto eat!  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck, let us know what happens!<br/>\n<br/>\nJen (whose daughter says that we are both going to dye our hair pink when<br/>\nshe turns 8) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":69885224,"authorName":"Aileen Bath","from":"&quot;Aileen Bath&quot; &lt;aileenb@...&gt;","profile":"aileenbunch","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Non Toxic Hair Dying","postDate":"1074547648","msgId":18054,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwZTMwMWMzZGVkMyQwYWIzNjJlMCQyNzExMTg0MEAwMDE4NTc0NTQ5Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":18063,"prevInTime":18053,"nextInTime":18055,"topicId":18054,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi!

We started with black henna -- because it&#39;s the only non-toxic thing we could find for black. And, I must say, her new darker look is so cool! She would like to try bright colors next (ie. blue, purple) and I&#39;m at a loss re: how to do this in a non-toxic manner. I read something about using kool-aid and am wondering if you can do this on dark hair or if we&#39;d need to lighten it up first. Also, if we need to lighten her hair back up, is there a way to do this in a non-toxic, chemical free manner?<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there any families out there who have played around with natural hair dying?
