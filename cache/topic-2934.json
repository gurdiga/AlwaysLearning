I feel a grayness and a quiet.  Usually accessed <br/>\nwhen I am thinking or daydreaming. Accompanied by a pleasant buzz <br/>\nsometimes. When kids were young, I used to run also and get this <br/>\nalone time. Fifty pounds later, you can see I haven&#39;t kept up on <br/>\nthat, LOL. I grab little bits of it now that the older ones can drive <br/>\nand I am sitting in the passenger seat. Doesn&#39;t everyone zone out <br/>\nwhile driving on long trips?  There seem to be different levels <br/>\ndepending on what I am doing.  Could it be related to my ADD?  Oldest <br/>\nfrom 2nd family also used to get upset at me for not paying attention <br/>\n(where have I heard that complaint before? ahh, my mom!), but she has <br/>\nrealized that it is not due to a lack of love for her now and she <br/>\npatiently &quot;wakes&quot; me up. She even explains it to the other kids. I <br/>\nhave noticed it in at least one of the other of my 5 kids when they <br/>\nwere in public school.<br/>\n<br/>\nTime to do the dishes, gotta run.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2923,"nextTopicId":2884}}
