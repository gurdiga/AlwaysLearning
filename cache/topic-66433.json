Eventually I noticed that any time I was a bit long winded it was some kind of outcome I was trying to control.  I wanted things to go my way, so I would use my words to get my kids and my husband, for that matter, to see it my way.  With enough explanation surely they would understand my exquisite logic and come to no other conclusion, right?  Well, it was irritating as all get out to them.  I was slow in learning, but eventually I recognized that whenever I used too many words, I was grasping for control.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, now I stop and ask myself what kind of outcome I am hoping for.  Is it really that important?  Is there some other ways things could turn out/be handled that are just as good or even better than my original hope?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Dana</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] How can I be more concise?","postDate":"1332734944","msgId":66437,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA3OUE5MjFELUIyNTktNDRDOS1BMEY1LUI2QjkyRjNDNjRBN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGprb2xhYytrcTkyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGprb2xhYytrcTkyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":66435,"nextInTopic":66440,"prevInTime":66436,"nextInTime":66438,"topicId":66433,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Instead of explaining something and then telling why you think so, and then summarizing and then asking whether the child understands (as I ve heard so many","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1866465836\">Instead of explaining something and then telling why you think so, and then summarizing and then asking whether the child understands (as I&#39;ve heard so many moms do, often in a sing-songy voice), think of whether you need to say anything at all, and then see if you can say it in five or six words.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt won&#39;t work in every situation, but moms who go on and on (especially in a sing-songy voice) aren&#39;t being listened to at all after a while, so it&#39;s worth trying.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes a mom talks so much it&#39;s as though she&#39;s doing all the talking for both of them.
