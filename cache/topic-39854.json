In my experience, when he is playing a new <br/>\n  game, it never fail to frustrate and stresses him out becuase the game <br/>\n  is new, and it challenges him from all angle. From the continous <br/>\n  trying to get pass the same level over and over again, to making the <br/>\n  same mistake over and over again. And also not quite knowing what to <br/>\n  do in each and every new scenario, and new level. <br/>\n<br/>\n  He will bang and throw the controller, scream and cry and shout at the <br/>\n  tv. It is all just pure frustration that needs to be worked out of his <br/>\n  system. Tho my kid don&#39;t tell me to shut up, but he will rant that the <br/>\n  game is stupid, he&#39;s stupid and that nothing i can to can help him. <br/>\n  Very similar behaviour, isn;t it? <br/>\n<br/>\n  In my experience, DS is just ranting because the emotions is just too <br/>\n  big and strong inside him. He is not asking for help, and do not WANT <br/>\n  me to help, because he seriously just wants to work or play out this <br/>\n  game problem out himself. It&#39;s just that it is SO hard emotionally for <br/>\n  him. <br/>\n<br/>\n  To how I understand, by me trying to help or talk to him, it&#39;s just <br/>\n  annoyed him more, because his brain and mind is still in gear, trying <br/>\n  to figure out the solution to his game, and my &quot;talk&quot; interrupts/ <br/>\n  distract that. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Plus when I offer suggestions, it is almost like I&#39;m pointing out his <br/>\n  failure to him, which is like rubbing salt into his wound, which gets <br/>\n  him even more angrier with himself, of his in-ability to pass that <br/>\n  level. Which is why he keep saying &quot;you don&#39;t understand! you can&#39;t <br/>\n  help me, nobody can!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n  Does this makes sense to you? Maybe this is why your son&#39;s re-action <br/>\n  is so strong. <br/>\n<br/>\n  In situations like this, my kid is possessed by the game, day and <br/>\n  night. It is that challenge, that unless he breaks it, he will never <br/>\n  feel peace. I just let him get on with it, supporting by means of <br/>\n  food and water and sitting down quietly next to him. I can acknowldege <br/>\n  his frustrations by saying &quot;i know, I know&quot;, and nothing more, and <br/>\n  lots of hugs as he rants away. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Sometimes, after a few exasperated tries, he&#39;ll storm walk, angry with <br/>\n  himself, crying, and then calm down enough to go check out some online <br/>\n  FAQs or cheatcodes, and then go back and try again. <br/>\n<br/>\n  But the minute he makes that breakthru, it&#39;s like the most fantastic <br/>\n  achievement ever for him. He&#39;ll be jumping and whooping and all of the <br/>\n  sudden, that game is not so hard afterall. And until that happens, <br/>\n  it&#39;ll be like the hardest struggle ever, literally, for him. <br/>\n<br/>\n  As for obsessession, this is where I see it best at work. That <br/>\n  stubborness of refusing to step away for a breather. That narrow <br/>\n  obsession of wanting to crack that game, at all cost, no matter how <br/>\n  tired he is. It is this narrow obsession that never allows my child to <br/>\n  give up, and achieve his victory in the end. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I have learnt a more positive word for this too.

I have a friend who eats, drinks, breathes, smokes, lives, dances, plays, loves jazz. Everything is jazz. It&#39;s amazing; he&#39;s amazing. I love listening to him tell stories about the music that he heard in Dubai when he and his wife worked there, or the stories about listening and playing in New Haven when he was growing up. He plays trumpet on Wednesday&#39;s in Newcastle. He has made a life out of his love. What is better than that?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I started graduate school and was talking to my advisor she talked with a little awe about David (my now husband) and the fact that he came knowing what it was he wanted to evolutionary theory to examine. He came to school to explore the thing that interested him, he didn&#39;t use school to define his interests. And it continues. His life and interests focus his research and life and interests and so on and so forth. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a scanner, I tend to bounce from interest to interest. I like that. I enjoy so many things in so many ways. But I totally appreciate the more focused folks in my life. Simon focuses so intensely on things.
