And am I just being a bit too confrontational?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  *******<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I&#39;ve taken a nice, hot, expensively long shower. I&#39;ve got a tape of Darin reading stories, playing against my belly. (He has this *gift* with talking to the unborn. &lt;g&gt;) And baby has moved her foot out of my ribs. So to answer my own question...<br/>\n    Yes, I am being too confrontational. And, there are way too many variables in my statements and questions above. It doesn&#39;t answer the OP&#39;s question, only confounds it, and really has no scope in our unschooling world. Do *they* (the imaginary people above, regardless of their religious or political beliefs) love their children? Yes, they probably do, but few if any are unschoolers, and most don&#39;t even homeschool. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  To try and answer the OP&#39;s questions; I agree with another&#39;s answer in that you can&#39;t count what people do in third world, deepest darkest jungles of Africa or South America as unschoolers because there is no school. And really extremist-religious-political folks probably don&#39;t unschool. (although I believe that really religious people do) But people with limited resources? Yes they can and do unschool. We lived for years with limited everything. But that didn&#39;t mean that I didn&#39;t seek out everything that I could for the kids. And if I had been the school-at-home type I couldn&#39;t have afforded Sonlight, Abeka, BJU or other curriculum so I would have had to write my own. I did have access to a library, and we did have Internet at home, but IF we didn&#39;t have it at home, the library had it. So limited resources doesn&#39;t have to mean whole-wide-world limiting, just different means and ways of getting what you want. <br/>\n  ~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] phylisophical question about unschooling","postDate":"1134236209","msgId":23499,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBFMUJBQThGLTVFRjgtNERBQy04NzhELUEwRUFBNzA0NzhEOUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUxMjEwMTcyOTE2LjExNjUwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjgxMTA2Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDUxMjEwMTcyOTE2LjExNjUwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjgxMTA2Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":23498,"nextInTopic":23500,"prevInTime":23498,"nextInTime":23500,"topicId":23483,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I wasn&#39;t trying to say that there are the same type (fundamentalist) of folks in other religions, just that no matter the religion, or social class, neglect is neglect and not unschooling. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  And I have met two different families who homeschool and one family who claims to unschool, but none really do either. And all three families purpose to homeschool is to isolate their children from all sorts of real or imagined dangers out in the *real world*. And none are particularly religious. One family attended the church I grew up in, sporadically. The other two claimed not to believe in God (of any sort) at all. And while I realize these examples are few, they do exist. And although I don&#39;t know of any personally, I have heard that there are fundamentalist christians who do unschool, despite the widespread belief in that group that unschooling is the same as neglect. <br/>\n  ~Nancy<br/>\n  *clear as mud yet? &lt;g&gt;*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] phylisophical question about unschooling","postDate":"1134194794","msgId":23493,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDQjc4MTYyLUJFOUYtNDNEMy04OURCLUJCRjg4MUQ4NzY4Q0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUxMjEwMDUyMTQ0LjU4NzgxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjgxMTAxLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDUxMjEwMDUyMTQ0LjU4NzgxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjgxMTAxLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":23492,"nextInTopic":23494,"prevInTime":23492,"nextInTime":23494,"topicId":23483,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On Dec 9, 2005, at 10:21 PM, NANCY OWENS wrote: -=-  This is where (I think) religious (and non-religious) school-at- homers and unschoolers (might) agree and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1873225862\"><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">On Dec 9, 2005, at 10:21 PM, NANCY OWENS wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-  This is where (I think) religious (and non-religious) school-at- <br/>\nhomers and unschoolers (might) agree and disagree.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAs much as I love qualified statements, the one above ends up  <br/>\nsaying... what?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-  Susan wrote:<br/>\nThat wouldn&#39;t be unschooling.

It matters not if you are religious Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, Pagan, really, or not-at-all. School-at-home homeschooling and unschooling and every thing in between is homeschooling. But keeping kids at home, for the sake of at homeness to avoid various things for whatever reason, religious (no matter the religion or no religion), AND doing nothing with them once you have them there is IMO, abuse.

And they give all sorts of reasons for this belief. *If you aren&#39;t religious, you aren&#39;t moral, and if you don&#39;t homeschool for religious reasons then why homeschool?* Not taking into account that many unschoolers may be religious, and that many school-at-home types may not be religious.

Many of these children don&#39;t have food, water, shelter, or safety, so learning takes a back seat to staying alive.  I&#39;m sure they still pick up what they need to get by in their society, but I wouldn&#39;t call it unschooling as we use the term in the US.  See below-<br/>\n  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I think the ultimate goal of unschooling is self-actualization (the top of the hierarchy - after all other needs are met)- described by Maslow as the following:<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Maslow writes the following of self-actualizing people:<br/>\n    <br/>\n   They embrace the facts and realities of the world (including themselves) rather than denying or avoiding them.   <br/>\n   They are spontaneous in their ideas and actions.   <br/>\n   They are creative.   <br/>\n   They are interested in solving problems; this often includes the problems of others. Solving these problems is often a key focus in their lives.   <br/>\n   They feel a closeness to other people, and generally appreciate life.   <br/>\n   They have a system of morality that is fully internalized and independent of external authority.   <br/>\n   They judge others without prejudice, in a way that can be termed objective. <br/>\n  HTH - all of the Maslow info I included here came from <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow&#39;s_hierarchy_of_needs#Self-actualization\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow&#39;s_hierarchy_of_needs#Self-actualization</a><br/>\n  so you can read more about it if you so choose.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Anastasia<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  jeans5kids &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeans5kids@...\">jeans5kids@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  Ok this is just a question not about a spacific family (that I can <br/>\nthink of right now): Now is unschooling what you (as members of this <br/>\ngroup) think of as the ideal situation and the best way for most <br/>\npeople to homeschool or is it just for people who are life-long <br/>\nlearners themselves and are well read or well educated on the <br/>\nunschooling subject.<br/>\nTrying to better explain the question:  Can anyone who just keeps <br/>\ntheir children home from school and doesn&#39;t do text booky type <br/>\nthings actually unschooling their children <br/>\nOr even better what about the people who are really religious (or <br/>\nreally something) and think that leaving their children out of <br/>\nschool is better for them socailly (or something)  but don&#39;t leave <br/>\nthe kids opptions open (education-wise) and/or don&#39;t do anything <br/>\nenriching with them????<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking about people with limited resources and such ??<br/>\nI hope someone can understand my question and answer it to the best <br/>\nof their ablity.

I think people see<br/>\nschooling as a way to escape their poverty, as well as a way to have access<br/>\nto resources we might take for granted. I don&#39;t know that it changes how the<br/>\nbrain works and how learning is accomplished inside the minds of the kids,<br/>\nbut it is a very different environment. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that people choosing to live a tribal traditional lifestyle are<br/>\noutside the scope of &quot;unschooling or not&quot;, since Unschooling educationally<br/>\nis a response to the existence of schools. It has been posited in the past<br/>\nthat without schools there is no Unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling works in an enriched home environment with attentive, committed<br/>\nto it parents. It also means being able to tap into the resources of the<br/>\ncommunity, including libraries and museums and cultural offerings.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure what you are asking...I consider the freedom and opportunity to<br/>\nUnschool to be a great gift. It&#39;s not that I am particularly adroit, but<br/>\nthat I am freed by circumstances and the commitment of my hardworking dh to<br/>\nbe able to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
