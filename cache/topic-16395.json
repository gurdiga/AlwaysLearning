I got it as an inter-library loan as ours didn&#39;t own it and I read it aloud on our camping trip this weekend.  It was funny and warm.  We all enjoyed it, my 10yo especially, and it isn&#39;t a &quot;children&#39;s&quot; book at all.  Very well written.<br/>\n <br/>\nRetta<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
