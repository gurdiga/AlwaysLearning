Anna, my oldest (age 6), has been fighting me about going for a while so I figured why continue that battle.  She loves playing outside on her new scooter and climbing the tree in our front yard so she is more or less practicing the same skills she would in the class and it is free.  My other daughter, Laura (age 2 1/2), has been fighting the structure of the class since day one (she has been in it for over a year).  I thought the structure was good for her, but it obviously it wasn&#39;t since she wasn&#39;t enjoying it and fought me tooth and nail the entire class (she did enjoy the free play time at the beginning of class but that was only 10-15 minutes).  I can&#39;t believe how ignorant I was!  I can take her to the park or other places where she is free to play how she wants to, oh yeah and it is FREE!!!  Thanks to everyone for teaching me a better and happier way to live and raise my girls.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care,<br/>\nJen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43597,"nextTopicId":43628}}
