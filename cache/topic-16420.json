The time between him <br/>\ntelling about the crash, and saying it WAS NOT Russ was about 50 years!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve told that story so much the kids are now trained when they call:   &quot;Hi <br/>\nmom, Everybody is FINE, there&#39;s been an accident!&quot;.  Not that we&#39;ve had that <br/>\nmany, but there have been a few of these type calls.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son Devin injured his arm very badly when I was hiking the Appalachian <br/>\nTrail this summer.  I struggled to get back home to him, and we went through all <br/>\nthe trauma of having an injured child (even tho he&#39;s 24).<br/>\n<br/>\nHis friend had crashed Devin&#39;s dirt bike a few months ago so Devin wasn&#39;t <br/>\nriding.  Devin then had to sell his street bike to have money before the <br/>\ndisability money started coming in from the arm injury.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen he had a friend that gave him a golf cart, in exchange for money owed.  <br/>\nDevin and his room mate were having a FINE time with it - where they live is <br/>\nzoned for carts, and there are linked golf courses - <br/>\n<br/>\nUNTIL, &quot;mom we are fine --&quot;  They tipped the GOLF CART!  The room mate got <br/>\nhis head bumped, and Devin is at the dentist today for a root canal and a cap on <br/>\nthe chipped tooth.<br/>\n<br/>\nI HATE THOSE CALLS!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16416,"nextTopicId":16378}}
