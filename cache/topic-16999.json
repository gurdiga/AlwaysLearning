I&#39;ve never known another apparently stable mother of three in<br/>\nher forties to kill herself. She was an elementary school teacher, too, I<br/>\nthink this was her second year teaching. I think that was stressful for<br/>\nher - she always seemed wound awfully tight, and so did her daughters.<br/>\nBut still... she seemed to have everything she&#39;d always wanted, she had<br/>\nfriends, options... why?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is hard. The theatre kids here are a pretty close group. Rain asked me<br/>\nto please never do that - we&#39;ve seen stuff on CSI and Law and Order and<br/>\nshe&#39;s said the same thing, but jokingly... this was a little more<br/>\nserious. It&#39;s hard to imagine a mom leaving her kids, that&#39;s what we both<br/>\nkeep going back to.<br/>\n<br/>\nEarlier this year, a high school student in Davis killed herself, and<br/>\nsome of the kids doing a show with Rain then knew her, and they talked<br/>\nabout it. There&#39;s a girl Rain&#39;s been in 4 or 5 shows with who tried to<br/>\nkill herself last year, when she was 11. Apparently there was an issue<br/>\nwith a boy... at eleven... <br/>\n<br/>\nDar</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":49412617,"authorName":"coyote&#39;s corner","from":"&quot;coyote&#39;s corner&quot; &lt;janis@...&gt;","profile":"calourojm","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"was  - I&#39;m not handling this well - now-suicide","postDate":"1067082060","msgId":16999,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwYzkwMWMzOWFlYyRkZDQ4YzkwMCQxNGRjMDA0NEBBb3Blbj4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDMxMDI0LjIyMzgyMi4xODguMC5mcmVlZm9ybUBqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":17014,"prevInTime":16998,"nextInTime":17000,"topicId":16999,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Not to change the subject - altho I am...has anyone noticed a rise in female suicides??
