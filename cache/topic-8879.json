The first question is &quot;How different are the<br/>\nPerrys from the Osbournes?&quot;  Answer?  &quot;Ozzy goes on the road and the kids<br/>\nstay home.  We all go.  We home-school our kids.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s cool....I think.  I am thinking Ozzy is probably better off not <br/>\nhomeschooling his kids :)<br/>\nI remember a conversation (was it here) some months ago about someone <br/>\nwatching the Osbournes show.  The usual weirdness was going on and the kids <br/>\nwere mad about being freaks on tv and getting teased at school....Ozzy said <br/>\nsomething about homeschooling them.<br/>\nThe poster of this information said something about how she would have loved <br/>\nto see an HSLDA leader watching that (ice tea spew for sure!)<br/>\nThat image has stayed with me!!
