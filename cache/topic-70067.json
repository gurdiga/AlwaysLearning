A sensitive period is a time when a child is ready and interested in learning something - and with a lot of things in young childhood, the two coincide. One year olds get very interested in mobility. Three year olds get very interested in causes and effects. Those are good examples of what a sensitive period looks like. In open classrooms and home-education, teachers are advised to be on the lookout for sensitive periods as the best times to teach specific subjects. The &quot;teachable moment&quot; theory is a correlary to sensitive periods.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn schools there Are windows when kids will get help for certain skills. That has more to do with classroom management than critical or sensitive periods, but it&#39;s a very real phenomenon and can make the difference between whether a child is labled &quot;slow&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; or some combination (like &quot;unmotivated&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Unschooling with Down syndrome","postDate":"1357430378","msgId":70194,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBRTI3NDQzLUE0MzMtNEQ2NC1CNjRELTM2QkY5MkY5RkVCN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGtjYWRqMStxZDRvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtjYWRqMStxZDRvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":70191,"nextInTopic":70203,"prevInTime":70193,"nextInTime":70195,"topicId":70067,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Everything I ve looked at from experts says that there is a small window when you need to get the child in therapy or else they will never be able to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-854300920\">-=-Everything I&#39;ve looked at &gt;from &quot;experts&quot; says that there is a small window when you need to get &gt;the child in therapy or else they will never be able to talk properly. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nExperts assume your child will go to school.<br/>\nExperts know that school sorts children by performance.<br/>\nExperts know that any lock-up environment creates cruel bullies.<br/>\n<br/>\nEverything changes when school is removed from the scene.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247112349,"authorName":"michelle_m29","from":"&quot;michelle_m29&quot; &lt;mmarr@...&gt;","profile":"michelle_m29","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling with Down syndrome","postDate":"1357429153","msgId":70191,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtjYWRqMStxZDRvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":70082,"nextInTopic":70194,"prevInTime":70190,"nextInTime":70192,"topicId":70067,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

You could just as well ask &quot;does gender impact unschooling?&quot; Yes... and no. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I suspect the question you&#39;re asking is closer to &quot;are there some things my child will Have To be Taught?&quot; and the answers to that will mostly come from your daughter herself. Is she curious about the world? Does she engage happily with things she enjoys? Does she like to play? Notice I&#39;m not asking anything about skills or independence - like anyone, there will be things she needs help doing, help learning. Her needs will be bigger and last longer in some areas, maybe many areas. Like other people, there will probably be things she&#39;ll want to learn on her own, things she&#39;ll want to have someone show her, things she&#39;ll want to do with help, things she&#39;ll pick up without realizing she&#39;s learning. Because those are all ways people learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Do therapies such as speech, OT, and PT have a place in unschooling?  She hated speech therapy, so we dropped it.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople do learn while they&#39;re miserable, but not much, certainly not much good. When a person is enjoying herself she&#39;s going to learn much more and more expansively. If some therapy or class or situation brings more joy and interest and expansiveness to your daughter&#39;s life, that&#39;s a good thing. If it makes her miserable, it&#39;s not. If she feels stuck in a situation, she&#39;s learning a lot about helplessness, powerlessness, and that&#39;s not good, either. <br/>\n<br/>\nBeyond being stuck and unhappy, though, the worst thing teachers and tutors and therapists can do is give a person the sense that learning comes from teaching. Unschoolers can and do take classes and make use of therapies! but it&#39;s much better to do so when kids are experienced enough to know that learning is about them, their needs and interests, not about a teacher&#39;s checklist.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t hesitate to make use of &quot;special needs&quot; resources which are actually helpful to you and your daughter!
