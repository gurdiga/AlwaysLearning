I wish that all children had the chance to grow and learn freely and that they could all be nourished by caring adults who&#39;ve decided to make them a priority.

She sees and knows deeply the hurts of others.  She sees and knows deeply that most of those hurts come from school and parents and the mixture of those.  She lives her life with conviction and others can see and know that there is another way to be.  She is changing the lives of others simply by being herself!

Kinda theoretical, I  <br/>\nknow :)-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a my-U.S.-perspective from my nosy-curious upbringing and  <br/>\ninterest in culture/learning/natural parenting.  It&#39;s not from an  <br/>\nofficial study or anything.  My dad&#39;s mother was an LPN (licensed  <br/>\npractical nurse, not a college-degreed registered nurse) after her  <br/>\nkids were grown, and had lots of stories for me about hospitals and  <br/>\nchildbirth and that:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen glass baby bottles and sanitizers and all came into vogue, it was  <br/>\nwhat white women did--what people with money did.  My grandmothers  <br/>\nstill breastfed; they were poor.  Black women famously breastfed, and  <br/>\nthere were a few things said about that--that they were, as a group,  <br/>\nso resentful that they had raised white babies so long that they were  <br/>\nby god going to take good care of their own.  And that they couldn&#39;t  <br/>\nafford &quot;modern convenience,&quot; and if they could they would use it.  And  <br/>\nthere was also something about the separation and resentment-- <br/>\naccentuating the difference, maybe?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen La Leche League (conservative Catholic origin) and the hippies  <br/>\n(unrelated except for the propensity to breastfeed babies as part of  <br/>\ndoing what seemed most natural) came along, lots of women started  <br/>\nabandoning bottle feeding.  It seemed, and I have heard and read a  <br/>\nlittle, that most of them were white women, and that in those days the  <br/>\nrate of bottlefeeding among Black and hispanic families went up and  <br/>\nstayed up, and the subsequent government programs in the late 1970&#39;s  <br/>\nand 1980&#39;s to try to get women to breastfeed (Breast is Best posters  <br/>\nand flyers and billboards) was being rejected by people who *finally*  <br/>\ncould afford bottles and formula.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat later set also included relatives of my own, because when I went  <br/>\nto a family reunion in 1986, when Kirby was four months old, he was  <br/>\none of three infants in the place, and when I wanted to nurse him, I  <br/>\nwent to the far end of the room.  I had a &quot;nursing top,&quot; something  <br/>\nwith unobtrusive access and he was nursing while I stood and read  <br/>\nbulletin boards about county notices and rodeos and cotton co-ops  <br/>\n(Roby, Texas, before a bunch of them won a big lottery) and tried to  <br/>\nbe by myself.  My Mamaw (dad&#39;s mom) came over and she looked at the  <br/>\nnotice board too, and stood there a few minutes and then said &quot;I don&#39;t  <br/>\nknow why those other women won&#39;t FEED THEIR BABIES.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne homeschooling family in town here came from Houston.  They&#39;re  <br/>\nAfrican-American.  The dad has a PhD, works at Sandia National  <br/>\nLaboratories, grew up with a little affluence in North Carolina--fancy  <br/>\nhouse, &quot;nice family.&quot;  The mom wasn&#39;t so fortunate.  She was in foster  <br/>\ncare in NYC.  Her parents were both living, but neither could take  <br/>\ncare of her.   So the mom was unschooling very happily, being with her  <br/>\nown three children as closely and as much as she possibly could; as  <br/>\nsweetly and as generously as she could.  The dad, though, was sure  <br/>\nthat IF his sons could go to school, then they HAD to go to school.   <br/>\nSo the older one was made to go to the Albuquerque Academy (a prep  <br/>\nschool) against his will.  The younger one is going to Menaul, another  <br/>\nprivate school, not as fancy.   The girl was allowed to keep  <br/>\nunschooling.

Go ahead.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps it&#39;s all about perspective. Three years ago, I was certain I could not homeschool.  I had not yet learned of Unschooling. I, the Mama, support our family. Mama&#39;s are &quot;supposed to be the one&#39;s at home with homeschooled kids,&quot; or so I thought. My DH, who works from home, claimed that he would be &quot;an ineffective teacher, that he could not do this, that he did not want the burden of our children&#39;s education on his shoulders--what if they failed?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThree years ago, I discovered that my beautiful daughter shut down when faced with school. She did things to avoid school that shut me down.  She hid in the pantry, under the covers, in the closet. She refused to get out of bed. She screamed bloody murder when I asked her to get her clothes on. I was mortified. Terrified. Completely clueless as to what to do. All those questions that do harm invaded me, &quot;why is my kid not like the other kids?&quot; &quot;How are we going to manage this?&quot; &quot;How will I deal with the schools and their attendance policies?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI pulled her out of Kindergarten and we told ourselves we&#39;d try it again next year, but we&#39;ll homeschool this year--mostly we just played and lived, and I started reading about Unschooling.  We tried school again the next year at my daughter&#39;s request, and it went okay. I had learned about honoring her choices. If she said she didn&#39;t want to go, I said fine. But most of the time she wanted to go. She went nearly every day. She loved her teacher. Then came 1st grade. And we were back to square one, almost.  I had learned more.  I had been reading and reading and reading about Unschooling.  The more I read, the more I thought it might work for us. That we could MAKE it work.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the decision came to pull her out of 1st grade, it was a decision that was made joyfully, peacefully, and powerfully.  It was a relief.  And we are making it work. We are a bit &quot;spoiled&quot; in many senses--we have family that lives near us and they support our Unschooling decision. We have been able to modify our schedules so that we, the parents, still spend the majority of time with our kids. I work part-time, but still earn enough to support us, although it&#39;s been pretty tight.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce our decision to live without school was made, it seems as if we have become more aware of the choices we, the parents, need to make to have it work out. It&#39;s not always easy--there are many days when I wish that I could be the one at home the majority of the time. But I can at least be content in the fact that my children are with people who love them and who are supportive of their day to day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most common &quot;rationale&quot; I hear parents use when confronted with the idea of homeschooling is, &quot;I could never do that because I could never be with my kids all day long.&quot;  But I have discovered that the more time I spend with my kids, the more time I want to spend with my kids.  It&#39;s a beautiful feeling to have, and it makes me sad to hear people say it so frequently.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause I&#39;ve seen my own perspective change and evolve, I think that might be one of the biggest factors involved.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Who can&#39;t unschool?","postDate":"1267808488","msgId":51427,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU0QzEzMkI0LUY2NzQtNDcyMS1CNzZELUQwQTA4QTFBOTk5RUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhtcTIyaCtna2s2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhtcTIyaCtna2s2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":51425,"nextInTopic":51436,"prevInTime":51426,"nextInTime":51428,"topicId":51391,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-So in some ways the point about middle-class privilege draws me to the reverse side of the equation: if the people who care the most about reform","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-391900334\">-=-So in some ways the point about &quot;middle-class privilege&quot; draws me  <br/>\nto the reverse side of the equation: if the people who care the most  <br/>\nabout reform (homeschoolers) are the people who take their kids out of  <br/>\nthe schools, who will be left to fight for the change our kids so  <br/>\ndesperately need? -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think homeschoolers are the people who care the most about  <br/>\nschool reform.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Holt was a school reformer for may years, until he came to the  <br/>\nconclusion that school could not be reformed.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany people on this list are or were teachers.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Who can&#39;t unschool?","postDate":"1267808410","msgId":51425,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFEQzQwODRFLTAzRDItNDA5MC1CQkYwLTYzRjEzMTlDNjcxMkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhtcTIyaCtna2s2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhtcTIyaCtna2s2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":51409,"nextInTopic":51427,"prevInTime":51424,"nextInTime":51426,"topicId":51391,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Homeschooling means, most of the time, that one parent needs to be home.

Go ahead.-------<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay....<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not going to talk about the economic reasons why I think unschooling is more accessible to the middle and upper classes as these are pretty self-evident.  Instead, I&#39;ll talk about one of my own personal problems with homeschooling, which is that I often feel as if I&#39;ve turned my back on the rest of the youth in our country.  This pains me.  I wish that all children had the chance to grow and learn freely and that they could all be nourished by caring adults who&#39;ve decided to make them a priority.  Imagine our world!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this just isn&#39;t the case. It isn&#39;t true for the schools and it isn&#39;t true for many families.  I remember how active my parents were in the public school I attended until 6th grade.  They actively fought to change a broken system and they were surprisingly successful.  Lots of young people, not just their children, benefited from their actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in some ways the point about &quot;middle-class privilege&quot; draws me to the reverse side of the equation:  if the people who care the most about reform (homeschoolers) are the people who take their kids out of the schools, who will be left to fight for the change our kids so desperately need? <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I&#39;m not willing to sacrifice my daughter to a system I feel is harmful--and I think I&#39;m *allowed* to make this choice because I come from a place that gives me confidence I can succeed without &quot;the system.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you caught the Discovery program last night, you heard the unschoolers&#39; neighbor talk about her concerns--there was genuine fear in her voice when she asked something like, &quot;how can you go to college if you don&#39;t spend your life in school?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople, parents especially, have been led to believe that they lack the knowledge to do something--anything-- without an expert (or institution) leading the way.  School has been touted as the great equalizer; if you &quot;stay in school&quot; you can be anything you want to be.  It is hard to turn your back on the hope schooling offers when you&#39;re surrounded by people living &quot;hopeless&quot; existences.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that there has been research showing that the level of parent schooling has no bering on the success of homeschooling, but that doesn&#39;t help people who don&#39;t know how or where to look for such comforting &quot;facts.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to talk about homeschooling with the woman who cleaned my office. She is from Mexico and went to school until she was twelve.  The most important thing to her, was making sure her granddaughter finished school.  This woman is one of the wisest women I&#39;ve ever met.  Yet she would never believe herself capable of facilitating a decent education for her granddaughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the unschoolers I know are very well educated. I know my own education has shown me how easy it is to learn when I&#39;m interested (and how much crap, which I immediately forgot, had to be swallowed just to get to the part I was interested in)--and this in turn allows me the ability to feel safe with our decisions to unschool.  I think it is a much harder choice for people who feel they could have gone farther in life had they only had a better education.  It isn&#39;t a *lack* of an education that makes unschooling impossible, it is the fear that goes along with the lack.  It is my suspicion that this fear is built directly into the educational system--the system that gets citizens ready for the hierarchies they&#39;ll need to deal with for the rest of their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m tired and not sure I&#39;m getting my thoughts across clearly.
