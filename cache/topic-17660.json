It&#39;s dangerous to the very sick people that they care for in <br/>\ntheir jobs. <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom www.snopes.com:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But even for the healthy 5- to 49-year-olds, the spray vaccine poses a risk, <br/>\nif not to them, then to those they come into contact with. In a few <br/>\ninstances, those who receive this live vaccine will as a consequence spread it to <br/>\nothers, so FluMist isn&#39;t recommended for people who take care of or live with <br/>\neither the elderly or those at risk of severe flu complications. The live virus can <br/>\nbe transmitted to others by way of coughing, sneezing, or talking, or via a <br/>\nfomite, an item touched by someone who has the virus.

I hope your holidays are going well. I have a question<br/>\n&gt; for all of you. Dh and I are planning to go to Florida for the first<br/>\n&gt; two weeks of January (we&#39;re in NY). My mom called me tonight almost<br/>\n&gt; hysterical because she saw on the news that another little girl, age 4,<br/>\n&gt; died from the flu. She said we really shouldn&#39;t go on vacation because<br/>\n&gt; none of us, especially the girls (ages 7, 5, 3, and 1) have had flu<br/>\n&gt; shots. Instinctively, I feel we should stay home, for that and<br/>\n&gt; finances, but dh desperately needs a vacation due to mental health<br/>\n&gt; reasons. What would all of you suggest? Those of you in Florida, what<br/>\n&gt; are your flu stats? I expect we&#39;ll go, but I am really worried about it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for your advice, Heidi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

But we went to Maine for a few days a week ago for a wedding and all came <br/>\nback sick.

We just <br/>\nfound some really cool online activities for girls who are into dolls, <br/>\nmake-up, and dress-up. My dd&#39;s ages 7, 5, and 3 have totally taken over <br/>\nmy computer for about 3 days since we found all this and our fridge is <br/>\nplastered with their printouts. These are the sites-<br/>\nhttp://www.barbie.com<br/>\nhttp://www.pollypockets.com<br/>\nhttp://www.what&#39;sherface.com<br/>\nhttp://www.bratzpack.com<br/>\nhttp://www.myscene.com<br/>\nhttp://www.divastarz<br/>\n<br/>\nEven I have had fun doing making my own pictures on what&#39;s her face. <br/>\nWell, just a thought for any of you with girls wandering around saying <br/>\nthey&#39;re bored. Good luck.
