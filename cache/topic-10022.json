I am an &quot;A number<br/>\none&quot; slob but even I reach a point.  Poor dh is very compulsive and I know<br/>\nhe does much better with stress as well if we can at least find the couch.<br/>\n<br/>\nProblem we have is the world is just such a fun place and there are so many<br/>\nthings we want to do.  Just today, we fed and milked all the animals and<br/>\ntook off into town.  We bought stuff for our new chickens (while dh was<br/>\nhelping build a chicken roost last night, he lamented not marrying the<br/>\n&quot;high-maintenance, likes to shop&quot; wife), stopped at the market for echinacea<br/>\nbecause Adriane needs to get a grip on her cold before her state gymnastics<br/>\nmeet this weekend and ended up enthralled by all the bulk stuff, went in<br/>\nsearch of Day of the Dead things to do, bought pumpkins, came home had lunch<br/>\nand the big kids are helping the little kids decorate theirs with markers<br/>\n(the big kids will carve theirs this evening).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, per usual, cereal bowls are still in the sink, laundry is yet to be<br/>\nfolded and we stick to the kitchen floor &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10018,"nextTopicId":10023}}
