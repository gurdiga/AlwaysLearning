But even if <br/>\nit was, it still wasn&#39;t a very nice thing to say.  When I saw that <br/>\nshe&#39;d left me an email, before I read it I was thinking that perhaps <br/>\nher son had wanted to meet my daughter, as they seem to have similar <br/>\ninterests and that was where my mind was already.  So when I read the <br/>\nemail it felt a little insulting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually prefer to write onlist.  I don&#39;t mind if others email me <br/>\nofflist, but I would hope it would be to further a comraderie of sorts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t always respond to posters onlist.  I responded to this <br/>\nparticular thread because I&#39;ve been there were this person is right <br/>\nnow.  That feeling of discomfort with something that their child is <br/>\ninterested in, where your gut reaction is to say &quot;no&quot;, when you work so <br/>\nmuch at saying &quot;yes&quot; to really build up a strong relationship with your <br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaying &quot;yes&quot; is a huge aspect of parenting in unschooling.  If my gut <br/>\nreaction is to say &quot;no&quot; to something, then that&#39;s a big indicator that <br/>\nI, as the parent, need to re-examine my own hang ups and feelings.  <br/>\nTalking to my kids about where they are coming from is extremely <br/>\nhelpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith this particular issue of clothing, just being present with my <br/>\ndaughter and talking about her likes and dislikes I came to discover <br/>\nthat my assumption of the why&#39;s and what&#39;s of it all were all wrong.  <br/>\nMy daughter showed things in a whole new light to me.  I never would <br/>\nhave found that out if I&#39;d said &quot;no&quot; because something felt <br/>\nuncomfortable with me, or if I had a misunderstanding about it.  It <br/>\nwould have been a missed opportunity of connection and understanding <br/>\nwith my child.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the age of 12 and 13, if you keep missing those opportunities and <br/>\nconnections and understandings, you will break those bonds that you <br/>\nworked so hard on building all those years when they were little.  It&#39;s <br/>\na crucial age where you can make it or break it, so to speak.  You <br/>\nmight still have a child that you can talk to and hang out with, but <br/>\nthat extra special something will be gone.  That trust and <br/>\nunderstanding won&#39;t be there like it was.  It&#39;s not something you can <br/>\njust do when your kids are little and it&#39;s easier because they are more <br/>\ntrusting and more likely to do what you say.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaying &quot;no&quot; because a parent feels that it is best for the child&#39;s own <br/>\ngood, doesn&#39;t promote confidence in the child or their ability to make <br/>\ngood decisions for themselves.  Ulimately, the message you send is that <br/>\nyou don&#39;t trust them to make good decision and that you, because you <br/>\nare the adult, know the only &quot;right&quot; way to do it.  It&#39;s extremely <br/>\narrogant to assume that a 12 or 13 yr old, or any age, doesn&#39;t have a <br/>\nbetter answer than the adult does.  My kids show me creative logical <br/>\nreasoning all the time.  They come up with better solutions than I do <br/>\nsometimes.  I wouldn&#39;t know that if I said &quot;no&quot; and made them do it my <br/>\nway.  They simply wouldn&#39;t have the opportunity to show me how smart <br/>\nthey are in their decision making abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nTraditional parenting tells parents to make the decisions and then when <br/>\nthe kids do it differently they call is misbehaving or disobedience, or <br/>\nany other number of other things.  Kids get told good only when they do <br/>\nit like the parents want them to.  There is no room for following their <br/>\nown instincts to solve problems or navigate their life, unless it <br/>\nhappens to be what the parents say is good and right.  It goes both <br/>\nways too and eventually the kid will be grown and say &quot;nope, my way <br/>\nnow, so butt out&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI already see a marked difference in my relationship with my children <br/>\nthat other parents don&#39;t have.  I contribute that to the way we treat <br/>\neach other and my ability to let go and say &quot;yes&quot; and really deeply <br/>\ntrust my kids and their abiltiy to make good choices for themselves.  <br/>\nThey do make good choices too, and even when they don&#39;t, the only place <br/>\nto go from there is to make a better one next time.  No punishment, no <br/>\nshaming or blaming, more just sympathizing with them about the outcome <br/>\nof a poor decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd just by the way, my 13 yo dd doesn&#39;t own any clothing items with <br/>\nguns on it, but that&#39;s not why she&#39;s sweet and kind and gentle.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] was Re: dying hair is Clothes make the boy","postDate":"1182046903","msgId":29344,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg3OEQ3MEI4LTFFQ0MtNDkzQi1BNzY4LUE1MjcwREE3NEZCRUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMTEwMWM3YjA4MSQ5ZTMxYzRjMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBXSUZFPg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwMTEwMWM3YjA4MSQ5ZTMxYzRjMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBXSUZFPg=="},"prevInTopic":29342,"nextInTopic":29351,"prevInTime":29342,"nextInTime":29345,"topicId":29336,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It is good email list netiquette not to write offlist unless either invited or you politely ask and get permission, first.

I don&#39;t feel any need for you to share. <br/>\nBut when I read your post my first response was how would clothing make <br/>\nsomeone more or less aggressive? I can see how it would make someone appear <br/>\nmore or less aggressive, I watched the Breakfast Club the other night and <br/>\nthe whole transformation of Ally Sheedy&#39;s character is all about how <br/>\nappearance matters. Actually much of the movie is about how appearance <br/>\nmatters. But it is also about how appearance is only skin deep, or societal <br/>\nstandards deep. At least that&#39;s what the letter at the end of the movie <br/>\ntells us&lt;grin&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just can&#39;t see how clothes could honestly change the aggression level of <br/>\nan individual.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; The reason I do have limits on the guns & bullet themes is for this<br/>\n&gt; particular child.  He has some definite issues with aggressive behavior <br/>\n&gt; (I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; not going into the details about all of it) and I am making a decision <br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; *I FEEL* is best for my child at this time. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29348,"nextTopicId":29345}}
