When my friend&#39;s then 6 year old had the chicken pox, it was so fun<br/>\nother children were jealous. She &quot;got to&quot; have a party, played &quot;stick the<br/>\npox on the donkey&quot;, and made a gooey mess with oatmeal in the bathtub. I got<br/>\nto care for her for a while and this was the happiest sick little girl I&#39;d<br/>\never seen...except for, it reminded me: When I had any sort of virus as a<br/>\nkid, I got pampered too: my mom made me an &quot;island&quot; on my bed (by propping a<br/>\nboard across the bed on the backs of two ladderback chairs), brought me<br/>\npiles of books and toys and drinks and love and attention. Of course, one of<br/>\nthe best parts was missing school. I got to do real learning instead, by<br/>\nvirtue of being sick! My point of course is that we could say to a sick<br/>\nchild: Be patient, you&#39;ll get better and then you can go out and play again.<br/>\nUnschooling is about &quot;playing&quot; and enjoying every moment, no matter what is<br/>\ngoing on around us, or in us. This also makes me think of the distinction<br/>\nbetween &quot;work&quot; and &quot;play&quot;. I enjoy my &quot;work&quot; the most when I think of it and<br/>\ntreat it as &quot;play&quot; and this is often easier to do (and more natural) than it<br/>\nsounds! (The fact that I&quot;m getting payed to do it, in fact, is often the<br/>\nbiggest obstacle).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, Mar 25, 2008 at 1:59 PM, Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   Melissa Wiley wrote this:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Patience is about trying to endure the present moment until a better<br/>\n&gt; one comes.
