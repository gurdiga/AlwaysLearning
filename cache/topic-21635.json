By putting the link up, it is like you are endorsing it, and<br/>\npossibly it won&#39;t be a good representation of unschooling. If you think it<br/>\nwill be a good representation for unschooling, then it might be another good<br/>\nway to help parents come to unschool their children.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis description from the link: &quot;will learn about the unschooling philosophy<br/>\nof home education including all the details and variations of how this style<br/>\nof homeschooling fits into daily living and how state regulations can be<br/>\nfollowed and satisfied.&quot; sounds pretty darn schooly, and I&#39;m not sure how<br/>\none would neatly display unschooling fitting into daily living, since each<br/>\nday is different (I hope!) and each home is different. But maybe they have<br/>\nideas about this that would work.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there&#39;s my two cents, for what they&#39;re worth!<br/>\n<br/>\nJacki<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 19, 2005 9:21 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:alwayslearning@yahoogroups.com\">alwayslearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] are courses good for getting to not needing<br/>\ncourses?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...<br/>\nMy first reaction to the e-mail below is to write and say &quot;That goes against<br/>\nthe whole idea, and that information is available free ANYday.&quot;   But are<br/>\nthere some people who would much rather take a single organized course on<br/>\nunschooling (like they would like to buy one book and read it and have done)<br/>\ninstead<br/>\nof poke around and get their information freeform?
