The same evening I refer to with the tv<br/>\nconcern, this daughter arrived in the evening, and the MIL got very angry<br/>\nbecause she felt the daughter had been out smoking pot, and warned her if<br/>\nshe was going to be high she could not be in her (MIL) presence, at this<br/>\nvacation house (equal turf right) and eventually the daughter left the<br/>\nvacation early.  It seems to me this example is one of the MIL feeling her<br/>\nvalues were being infringed on by being exposed to something (a person who<br/>\nwas high) being in her presence.
