(They are about 3 miles round trips.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe try to &quot;shake it up&quot; where we go. There are about<br/>\n5-6 different parks we might go to. Maybe the mall or<br/>\na McDonald&#39;s play place when the weather&#39;s bad. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was involved in a local chapter of MOMS Club, which<br/>\nis an international organization, for a few years, and<br/>\nthat helped.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that helped (and still helps) is we have<br/>\nafternoon naptime/roomtime. It lets me rest and clear<br/>\nmy head, and helps the kids unwind too.<br/>\n<br/>\nJenny<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://beanmommyandthethreebeans.blogspot.com/\">http://beanmommyandthethreebeans.blogspot.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34917,"nextTopicId":34966}}
