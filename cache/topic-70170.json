The first part is a quote from someone saying she had a hard time being fully present with her children.  I quoted just this one part and responded:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=I hate it, and feel like I&#39;m missing out on so many sweet, little moments, but it is so hard for me to be fully present, almost like I can&#39;t control it. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWell don&#39;t hate it. Hate&#39;s no good. And you can&#39;t &quot;control it.&quot; It might be easier to see it as a series of choices, with lots of chances to zone out, and lots of opportunities to focus back in. <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople zone in and out all the time. It&#39;s not a sin. Live lightly. That&#39;s good for your children, if you can come back as esily as you slipped momentarily away, and if you&#39;re not hardened with self-recrimination and hate. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/negativity\">http://sandradodd.com/negativity</a> <br/>\nBe sweet and soft, for your children.<br/>\n<br/>\n===============================================<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mom is holding herself stiff and uptight, I think.  She&#39;s feeling wrong, and bad.  In 32 words, three of them were &quot;hate,&quot; &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;control.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were talking at the symposium recently about the sort of &quot;body language&quot; that can sometimes be read in people&#39;s writing.   That&#39;s an example of something I spotted.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are people who have read my writing, though, and said I was mean and harsh.  But I write the way I speak, and in person I&#39;m not mean and harsh.   (Someone wrote to me a few months ago, said she had gone to a meetup near her in southern California and people there who had met me said I was just as mean in person.  I had reason to think she hadn&#39;t had time to go to a meetup, and I figure it was made up, but there&#39;s another aspect that is knowing the person&#39;s voice and posture.  It&#39;s not always possible.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I suggest, on one of these discussions, that someone needs to read more and write less, that&#39;s because she seems to be going off a cliff or down a hole, rather than uphill into the light that will help her be a sweeter, kinder mother.  I&#39;m thinking of her kids, and the happiness she can have when the relationship improves, rather than thinking about her particular feelings right now in this moment in this discussion.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor people who are writing, it&#39;s entirely fair and fine to proofread what you&#39;ve written before sending it.  It would be great if everyone would do that!  And while you&#39;re reading for spelling and punctuation, also look at what you&#39;ve said, and the words you&#39;ve used.  Journal writers through the ages have done that without even having an audience.  And in journals, there&#39;s the added clue of handwriting going hard or jittery.  Maybe the computer keyboard equivalent could be whether your hands are tension-filled; it&#39;s not a perfect indicator.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1935,"nextTopicId":70067}}
