He was very pleasant and professional - not the<br/>\nslightest touch of diva (what&#39;s the equivalent male word? Christian Bale?).<br/>\n<br/>\nOne time he was kept very late on set, a super long shoot day, and no-one<br/>\nwanted to go and wake him up for his shot, not because we were worried about<br/>\nhim being cranky but because we all felt so sympathetic towards him. He<br/>\nwasn&#39;t happy, but he was still professional, and took a couple of deep<br/>\nbreaths. In the end he was a little stern about expecting to be able to go<br/>\nhome after this shot and that this not happen again, but we all agreed with<br/>\nhim!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we went to shoot at the Ambassador Hotel (of historical significance)<br/>\nwhile it was still a filming location and not a school. (:p~~~) we were<br/>\nshooting in one of the old two storey bungalows decorated as a slum hovel<br/>\ninside. On the wall was an existing collage including (I swear I didn&#39;t put<br/>\nit there) a photo of the Malcolm in the famous conditioning scene. After<br/>\nsome debate within our department, I left it as homage (I won the debate).<br/>\nIt does appear in the final movie as the camera passes over that part of the<br/>\nwall. Malcolm didn&#39;t mind the reference.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe movie is called &quot;Yesterday&#39;s Target&quot; and also features LeVar Burton<br/>\nfresh off &quot;Star Trek: Next Generation&quot; and Daniel Baldwin.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow there was an interesting guy - he went into the family business of<br/>\nacting, but I wonder if he really enjoys it. I know what one of his real<br/>\npassions was. He just lit up when he started talking about his dogs. It<br/>\nreally struck me at the time how his whole demeanor changed and I still<br/>\nremember having this brief conversation after all these years. He bred<br/>\nRottweilers. I wonder if he still does.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose that what I really wanted to do here was give one tiny example of<br/>\nthe idea that a ton of thought goes into every little detail that appears on<br/>\nscreen - including the emotional life of the character that the actors<br/>\nsupply with the assistance of the costume designer, art department, props<br/>\nmaster, cinematographer and each other. Nothing that appears on screen is<br/>\nthere by accident, except perhaps in live to air tv - which has its own<br/>\nexcitement. You can watch with this in mind and it becomes a whole different<br/>\nlevel of enjoyment.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I just need to sort out my own head before we watch it.  I reckon I&#39;ll tell her I&#39;ve not seen it before (actually, I think it&#39;s true that I&#39;ve not seen it right through, so am probably fearing the unknown scenes that I may have missed) and would like to share it with her just like we share her favourite comedies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; IF you are supportive and part of it, you&#39;ll free your daughter<br/>\n&gt; to be young and childlike when that&#39;s how she&#39;s feeling, even though there<br/>\n&gt; are times she wants to be older and worldy.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, though right now she&#39;s still at the novelty stage of wanting to always seem older and worldly.  I suppose that&#39;s the same with most people experiencing a change in their lives - it defines them for a while. She was at school for a long time too, and I&#39;m sure this also has an impact.  Your relationship with your daughter sounds really wonderful and I get what you&#39;re saying about allowing her to grow without arbitrary restrictions of what&#39;s age-appropriate.  I try to avoid these but, as I said before, my face and body language may indicate differently on occasions (suppose I need to genuinely relax in order to stop giving off these signals!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d get the movie and say, &quot;I got interested in rewatching A Clockwork<br/>\n&gt; Orange after you&#39;d mentioned it - it is on Netflix watch instantly if you<br/>\n&gt; want to watch it.&quot; Maybe you could get her the book, first. Does she know<br/>\n&gt; anything at all about Skinnerian conditioning and all that? Does she know<br/>\n&gt; what you think of it? Do you? Give her some context. One of the things about<br/>\n&gt; unschooling is that we aren&#39;t big fans of Skinnerian conditioning - we don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; use reward and punishment as tools to shape or condition our kids.<br/>\n&gt; Mentioning that might be a cool way to connect the movie to your ideas -<br/>\n&gt; something to converse about, anyway. Maybe. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lovely idea, thanks. We&#39;ve talked around these ideas in general before, but not looked at them in specific terms of Skinnerian conditioning.     <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; OR - maybe she has completely different reasons for wanting to see it.

Not at all a bad<br/>\n&gt; reason to want to see it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; If she really wouldn&#39;t want to watch it with you, then maybe get it and<br/>\n&gt; watch it yourself and let her watch it herself - but you&#39;d both watch it<br/>\n&gt; within the same day or two.

Why not just<br/>\nhave it in the mix of movies you watch?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t even remember which of my kids was the one who brought the movie up<br/>\n- but it came up and I told them how I had just walked into a theater and<br/>\nseen it, with no prior knowledge about what I was about to see. I was<br/>\ntraveling, camping across Canada, with other kids my age, and we hadn&#39;t even<br/>\nheard of it, but just went to a movie in some little one theater/one movie<br/>\ntown. I had to go out into the lobby a few times - and didn&#39;t see the whole<br/>\nthing. I&#39;ve watched it a few times since, though. So, I warned them it could<br/>\nbe intense and upsetting, but that I thought it was still quite an amazing<br/>\nmovie. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThis sounds more like a matter of mom not wanting her little girl to grow up<br/>\n(puberty at 12 isn&#39;t at all early) - and, I just want to say, it will happen<br/>\nand you can make things harder by resisting or you can be supportive and<br/>\npart of it. IF you are supportive and part of it, you&#39;ll free your daughter<br/>\nto be young and childlike when that&#39;s how she&#39;s feeling, even though there<br/>\nare times she wants to be older and worldy. My now-19 year old has a 24 year<br/>\nold very serious boyfriend - but she can still be my little girl and hold my<br/>\nhand and cuddle up and ooh and aah over watching Mr. Rogers reruns on tv and<br/>\nlove re-reading her favorite children&#39;s books, etc. She doesn&#39;t feel the<br/>\nneed to prove she&#39;s an adult. I really think that if I&#39;d resisted her more<br/>\ngrown-up interests, she&#39;d have dug in her heels and felt like she needed to<br/>\nprove she was grown up and that could have gone in some not-great<br/>\ndirections.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d get the movie and say, &quot;I got interested in rewatching A Clockwork<br/>\nOrange after you&#39;d mentioned it - it is on Netflix watch instantly if you<br/>\nwant to watch it.&quot; Maybe you could get her the book, first. Does she know<br/>\nanything at all about Skinnerian conditioning and all that? Does she know<br/>\nwhat you think of it? Do you? Give her some context. One of the things about<br/>\nunschooling is that we aren&#39;t big fans of Skinnerian conditioning - we don&#39;t<br/>\nuse reward and punishment as tools to shape or condition our kids.<br/>\nMentioning that might be a cool way to connect the movie to your ideas -<br/>\nsomething to converse about, anyway. Maybe. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOR - maybe she has completely different reasons for wanting to see it. Maybe<br/>\nsome kids she knows are talking about it - making it a big deal that they&#39;ve<br/>\nseen it - and she just doesn&#39;t want to feel left out. Not at all a bad<br/>\nreason to want to see it.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIf she really wouldn&#39;t want to watch it with you, then maybe get it and<br/>\nwatch it yourself and let her watch it herself - but you&#39;d both watch it<br/>\nwithin the same day or two. But, really, I&#39;d try to just lighten WAY up over<br/>\nit and treat it just like you&#39;d normally treat a movie she&#39;s expressed an<br/>\ninterest in.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-pam <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: my husband - teenagers, television, pornography...","postDate":"1266161954","msgId":50769,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU1NEQ5NkU0LTEzQTEtNEZFQy04RkQ2LTlCQTI0NzAyNDQ3M0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDE3M2Q4LjNlY2ZlZmI5LjM4YTk0YjUxQGFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDE3M2Q4LjNlY2ZlZmI5LjM4YTk0YjUxQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":50767,"nextInTopic":50772,"prevInTime":50768,"nextInTime":50770,"topicId":50748,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=--13 year-old for whom puberty s come fairly early, I recognize a lot of this.

If music were held as the  <br/>\nultimate, books rob us of sound.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of visuals and lack of internal dialogue, how is TV  <br/>\ndifferent than a play, story teller or puppet show?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s as much a handicap for a visual learner to be kept from the  <br/>\nmedium they learn best from (video and watching people) as it would  <br/>\nbe for someone who learns best by reading to be kept from books. An  <br/>\nartist needs to see what things look like and how other artists have  <br/>\ninterpreted reality. Words are a poor substitute. (And a writer needs  <br/>\nto read how others have captured reality in words.)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":183568025,"authorName":"Bob Collier","from":"&quot;Bob Collier&quot; &lt;bobcollier@...&gt;","profile":"quaussiebob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: my husband - teenagers, television, pornography...","postDate":"1266114646","msgId":50752,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhsN244bSs3MHRzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhsN2tpaSs4Z3YzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":50751,"nextInTopic":50753,"prevInTime":50751,"nextInTime":50753,"topicId":50748,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
