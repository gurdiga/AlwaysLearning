Thank you for providing this &quot;fountain.&quot;<br/>\nI have just begun my own blog about parenting, homeschooling and unschooling and although I&#39;m not &quot;completely there&quot; in the unschooling department- I&#39;m heading in that direction... I&#39;m writing the blog to define what I&#39;m doing so at least the people around me who don&#39;t understand can look at some of my writings.. It&#39;s also a place to compile cool info, and ultimately I want it to be a support for people who may be interested in going in a more homeschooling or  unschooling direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may be completely redundant and unnecessary to ask- but I wanted to make sure it was OK with you if I post links to your site on my blog.
