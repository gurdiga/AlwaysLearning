I love the humor.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve loved getting to watch all the Disney movies (and some of the other good ones too) <br/>\nwith my kids.  It&#39;s my guilty pleasure.  And I even liked Barney--shhhh, don&#39;t tell!<br/>\n<br/>\nI enjoyed watching Saturday morning cartoons (we didn&#39;t have cable) until I was at least <br/>\n15.  And the X-mas specials--don&#39;t get me started!  I think it kinda&#39; ruined it for me when <br/>\nthey went to videotape and they could be watched any ole&#39; time...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids watch all kinds of stuff for all ages.  One of the games my daughter (9) likes to <br/>\nplay with her grandparents is that magnetic fishing game.  They just told me that today, <br/>\nwith a laugh about how that game is for three to seven year olds.  They didn&#39;t seem to, but <br/>\nI get it--sometimes it&#39;s fun to do something that&#39;s easy.  I don&#39;t always want a challenge <br/>\neither.  I like to play games that are simple and repetitive sometimes, and so does she.  <br/>\nJust for fun.  And my MIL said that dd could always beat them because her reactions are <br/>\nfaster than theirs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were at our videogame day yesterday.  We have a great community that&#39;s been <br/>\ntogether awhile, so kids are really comfortable.  There were kids from 4 to 13, and <br/>\neveryone mixed, everyone played.  It was more about personalities than ages--which feels <br/>\nso much more natural to me.  There was considerable time when one of the 13 year olds <br/>\nwas happily playing with the four year old.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI had a friend that was two or three years older than me--I might have been 11 or 12 and <br/>\nshe was 14 or 15.  It was in a community group rather than school, and we really <br/>\nconnected after a long time for either of us not connecting with anyone.  It made my <br/>\nmother so uncomfortable for me to have a friend that was older (and she was a really <br/>\n&quot;nice&quot; girl--no trouble in sight) that she made me end the friendship.  That was very sad <br/>\nfor me.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":183568025,"authorName":"Bob Collier","from":"&quot;Bob Collier&quot; &lt;bobcollier@...&gt;","profile":"quaussiebob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Kids liking things intended for different ages","postDate":"1208663846","msgId":34406,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZ1ZWV2NitxczcwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDI3YWEyYWU4MDgwNDE4MTUzNXE0N2IwMDVmOW8xOTYxYWY4M2FkNjRkYjcyQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":34402,"nextInTopic":34407,"prevInTime":34405,"nextInTime":34407,"topicId":34378,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... play it, ...
