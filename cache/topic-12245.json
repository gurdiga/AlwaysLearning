What about the love we have to<br/>\ngive to others, ourselves and doing something we love for a living that<br/>\nwe are passionate about, regardless of the money it brings us.  It also<br/>\nleaves out those people that didn&#39;t finish high school and still became<br/>\nfinancially wealthy such as Dave Thomas the founder of Wendys.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo as usual the school is single minded in its belief that money is the<br/>\nanswer to everything and that money will make everything better.  Ask<br/>\nthose people who become instant millionaires when they won the lottery<br/>\nwhat it did for them emotionally.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also a vast difference between someone who &quot;drops out&quot; of<br/>\nschool and someone who voluntarily doesn&#39;t go to school at all because<br/>\nthey choose to use the world as their way of learning.  Even the drop<br/>\nouts have the right idea when they don&#39;t want to stay in school because<br/>\nthere are bored, uninspired and cannot connect with what adults<br/>\ndisguised as &quot;teachers&quot; believe they need to know.<br/>\n<br/>\nI spent my entire 5th year (that&#39;s the last year in British Schools if<br/>\nyou are not going onto University) skipping school nearly every day.<br/>\nThere were about 5 of us that would go to my house and read entire<br/>\nbooks.  We would take it in turns to read out loud and read books such<br/>\nas Little Women or a good Harold Robbins book.  We spent the spring<br/>\ncleaning up our back garden where the grass had grown to about 3 feet<br/>\nand it was a mess.  We planted flowers and made it look beautiful.  I<br/>\nremember it as being the best experience I&#39;d had in my life up to that<br/>\npoint.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn F<br/>\nTucson, AZ<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;  Date: Sat, 8 Feb 2003 22:07:15 -0800<br/>\n &gt;&gt;  From: Pam Sorooshian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: A yucky bit from the NYT<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Today I was at a Destination Imagination event being held at a high <br/>\n&gt;&gt;school.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;There was a sign in one of the rooms that said that people who<br/>\n </span></blockquote>graduate <br/>\nfrom high school make about $236,000 more in income in their lifetime <br/>\nthan those who drop out.&gt;&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12247,"nextTopicId":12243}}
