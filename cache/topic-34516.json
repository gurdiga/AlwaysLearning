They have been helpful and supportive when so many books are<br/>\nlike the one you&#39;ve mentioned.  I cannot imagine letting any baby or<br/>\nchild, but especially a newborn, just cry.  They cry for a reason.  I<br/>\nhave had this debate with many moms who belive that their babies should<br/>\nimmediately conform to their (the mom&#39;s) schedules or desires.  I tell<br/>\nthem to imagine being torn from their first comfort zones, all warm and<br/>\nfed and cozy, and thrust into aloneness, hungry and scared and helpless.<br/>\nMost cannot even imagine themselves in this situation, yet think it okay<br/>\nto let their little precious babies be there.  UGH!!!  My little one,<br/>\nwho is 2 and 1/2, is currently on a sleep protest.  He&#39;s still a nursing<br/>\nbaby and wants to nurse a lot at night.  He wakes latel at 2 am and is<br/>\nup for hours.  I do not let him cry, do not leave him to himself..  We<br/>\nrock, we sing, we nurse, whatever.  Poor little things cannot help what<br/>\ntheir bodies need at 2 am!  I am ready, though, for whatever<br/>\ndevelopmental phase this is to pass!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, here is the link to Dr. Sears&#39; site and another site I really<br/>\nlike.  I hope your sister melts when she holds her baby the first time<br/>\nso much that she cannot imagine letting such a tiny little creature cry<br/>\nit out  Get her a couple of the Sears books for a shower gift or<br/>\nhospital care package.  Anyone can write a baby book and call themselves<br/>\nan expert -- look at Marilu Henner & insert eye-roll here.
