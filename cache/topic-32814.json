Learn to  <br/>\ncalm  yourself with deep breaths wherever you are:  car, bathroom,  <br/>\nwalking to the store.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you&#39;re choosing music or movies, choose the uplifting or happy  <br/>\nones over the shoot-em-up-death ones when  you&#39;re stressed or on the  <br/>\nedge of depression.  If it has to be Jim Carey, watch The Truman Show  <br/>\ninstead of The Cable Guy.   If you&#39;re totally in the mood for Robin  <br/>\nWilliams, watch Hook or Mrs. Doubtfire instead of One Hour Photo.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are times to watch sad  or scary movies (or sad music, or  <br/>\ndepressing books) but if you do it all the time, when will you  <br/>\nrecharge and rise up?<br/>\n<br/>\nComfort food can be good.  If you&#39;re feeling overwhelmed, what is it  <br/>\nthat has good memories or associations for you?  Instant pudding?   <br/>\nMashed potatoes?  Macaroni and Cheese?   Figure out what kinds of  <br/>\nthings make you feel better.  Think of all y our senses and provide  <br/>\nyourself with what tastes, looks, feels, smells and sounds soothing  <br/>\n(at  least one or two of the list).<br/>\n<br/>\nThen learn to do that for your kids, too!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":228638122,"authorName":"Hallie","from":"Hallie &lt;hpmarker@...&gt;","profile":"hpmarker","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re:self-improvement","postDate":"1205085774","msgId":32884,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMxNzI3Mi4zMjM3Ni5xbUB3ZWI1MTcwMy5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":32880,"nextInTopic":32885,"prevInTime":32883,"nextInTime":32885,"topicId":32814,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, Sandra and everyone, I ve been lurking for a while and would like to introduce myself briefly before getting to the self-improvement subject and listing","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-857621284\">Hi, Sandra and everyone,<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I&#39;ve been lurking for a while and would like to introduce myself briefly before getting to the self-improvement subject and listing practices and readings that have helped me.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  We are Hallie (me, 44 y/o), Jeff (dh, 49 y/o) and Adin (ds, newly-6 y/o).  We have been unschoolers for almost all of Adin&#39;s life (when he was 3 y/o, we sent Adin to a twice-a- week &quot;preschool,&quot; which we finally pulled him out of totally by February of that year). <br/>\n   <br/>\n  All three of us tend to be sensitive, anxious people, although there are many other adjectives that also apply!  Jeff and I both carry quite a bit of baggage from our childhoods in families who misunderstood us and from cruelty we each suffered in school.  I&#39;ve also become convinced that simply living unmindfully in this world creates lots of anxiety/depression/anger for which no person or event is to blame.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  The first beneficial thing I did for myself and my family was to retire from a highly stressful job as an attorney.  My son&#39;s birth led me to this decision, and I&#39;ll be grateful to him forever for this.  I would probably never have been able to work on self-improvement if he hadn&#39;t arrived in our lives. For me, self-improvement boils down to being present and mindful.  Every day, I fall short sometimes of being mindful and present.  There are times when I probably appear not to have improved at all.  The difference is that I&#39;m now aware of a healthier path that I can always return to!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  So, to get to the subject of the post:<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Psychotherapy, meditation & literature (all sorts) are what I use for self-improvement.  If I only have time or energy for one of these practices, I always turn to literature.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Psychotherapy:  Cognitive psychotherapy worked best for me, because it helped me recognize and begin to change very old thought patterns that were no longer useful to me.  Another good thing for me about this form of therapy is that it does not require years on the analyst&#39;s couch.  When I gained some insight into my thought processes (and some insight into how to gain further insight, etc.) this was work I could do on my own with infrequent &quot;tune-ups&quot; with the therapist.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Meditation:  Zen meditation has been great for me.  My teacher focuses on breathing awareness, but I think any form of meditation when practiced daily even for a few minutes, can have miraculous effects.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Literature (including groups like this one) has been my most important tool.  Here are a few of my biggies:<br/>\n   <br/>\n  (1)  The AA Big Book.  NOT FOR ALCOHOLICS ONLY!!!  The Big Book is the best self-improvement book ever written, in my opinion.  It feels divinely inspired to me, and I think it can benefit anyone in any situation.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  (2)  Radical Acceptance, by Tara Brach<br/>\n   <br/>\n  (3) Mindful Parenting, by Myla & Jon Kabat-Zinn<br/>\n   <br/>\n  (4) The Breathing Book, by Donna Farhi<br/>\n   <br/>\n  (5) &quot;Growing Without Schooling,&quot; John Holt&#39;s newsletter.  I bought some back issues and received others from angelic unschoolers who did not need for them anymore.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  (6) Non-Violent Communication, by Marshall Rosenberg<br/>\n   <br/>\n  (7) Learning All the Time, by John Holt<br/>\n   <br/>\n  (8) How Children Fail, by John Holt<br/>\n   <br/>\n  (9) Animal, Vegetable, Miracle, by Barbara Kingsolver<br/>\n   <br/>\n  (10) This list, which I found only recently.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  (11)  Anne Ohman&#39;s &quot;Shine With Unschooling&quot; list<br/>\n   <br/>\n  (12) The Highly Sensitive Child & The Highly Sensitive Person, by Elaine Aron<br/>\n   <br/>\n  (13) The Explosive Child, by Ross Greene<br/>\n   <br/>\n  (14)  A Course in Miracles.  It is written in Christian terminology, and I am not a Christian, but I have benefited from it.  I like the daily exercises.  Someone told me the other day that Oprah was recently touting ACIM, so it may become famous soon!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  (15)  Anything by Pema Chodron<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I&#39;ll stop the list there before this post gets too long!  Anyway, I keep all of these materials handy and just &quot;baste&quot; in them when I need rejuvenation.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Thank you, Sandra, for opening up this topic.

After I had children, that waned a bit. As Wyl approached &quot;school  age&quot;, <br/>\nI found a lot of tension in the relationship between Dave and I, Wyl and  both <br/>\nmy parents-and that increased as Wyl&#39;s age did. Before long, my entire  <br/>\nparenting &quot;being&quot; had some aspect of my mother in it-my focus was so on &quot;not  being <br/>\na mother like she was&quot; that she overshadowed so many areas... From my  <br/>\ndelving into things on the unschooling groups, asking some general questions on  <br/>\nthem and finding a couple excellent mentors, I finally was able to see  this. <br/>\nAfter taking a long break from having any contact with my parents, I was  able to <br/>\nrefocus. With reading messages *daily* on 2 or 3 unschooling groups and  some <br/>\nwonderful advice and guidance from my mentors, I was able to find the  parent <br/>\nthat I want to be, the parent that I *am*, completely unrelated to who my  <br/>\nmother was as a parent. It was, again, a struggle in perceptions, but a struggle <br/>\n SO worth it. I&#39;ve bought stacks of books recommended by unschoolers I trust <br/>\nand  yet... I just don&#39;t have time to read them!

My first memory of me *knowing* what I <br/>\nwanted to be when I grew up was in about the 8th grade...I told my <br/>\nDad that I wanted to go to Cornell and study Law, he said &quot;you <br/>\naren&#39;t smart enough&quot; I wanted to fight for justice...I knew what I <br/>\nwas experiencing wasn&#39;t fair!  So yes...shame, abuse, alcoholism and <br/>\njust plain stupidity wrapped up in a pretty socially acceptable <br/>\nwrapper is the way I grew up. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my quiet soap boxes is alcoholism, I think it is one of the <br/>\nprofound problems in society today. So often overlooked, the damage <br/>\nit is doing to not only families and children, but every aspect of <br/>\nour culture. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, the question was...how&#39;d I get here from there...well I too LOVE <br/>\nto read. The library is like my favorite place :-) Not novels...self-<br/>\nhelp, parenting, spirituality, gardening...just to name a few. I <br/>\nstarted reading all kinds of spirituality type books geez over 20 <br/>\nyears ago...it&#39;s funny I have read some of them again lately, then <br/>\nremembering...I read this when I lived in San Fran or Colorado...I <br/>\nused to move alot, that was another part of my self discovery...<br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter where you go...you&#39;re always there ;-) when I realized a <br/>\nnew place wasn&#39;t gonna fix what was wrong inside of me...it was off <br/>\nto therapy! That to proved to be a journey...lots of wackos out <br/>\nthere if ya know what I mean. Yes, most of them helped me, and even <br/>\nif they didn&#39;t I learned from the experience. I&#39;m going out on a <br/>\nlimb here....but I pretty much think therapy should be a requirement <br/>\nfor this school we call life. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood friends who have their shit together are another really big <br/>\npart of my journey. These groups have been very helpful/healing, <br/>\nit&#39;s just not my favorite forum to listen and share. Reading and <br/>\ntyping on the computer are not my favorite things. I&#39;m a <br/>\ntalker...not a typer. I also like to hear,see,feel what the other <br/>\npeople are saying, which can get lost in translation online IMHO. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really late and I have about 3 new books I was gonna look at <br/>\nbefore bed...guess I need to go self-improve. I like to read <br/>\nsomething kind of &quot;meaty&quot; right before sleep...I think it sinks in <br/>\nover night...my brain is like chicken...it needs to marinade ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Tracy~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-.

I was a<br/>\ndrunk in those days and flitting from job to job with plenty of<br/>\nunemployment in between, and generally despondent that I was failing<br/>\nmy wife, the person who had saved me from total disaster.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen our daughter was born and, when she was about six months old, my<br/>\nwife returned to her career and I became the at home parent by<br/>\ndefault. I had already decided by then that I would raise my daughter<br/>\naccording to the new ideas that had been making such a positive<br/>\ndifference in *my* life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were four books that were particularly influential in my early<br/>\nyears as a stay-at-home dad:<br/>\n<br/>\nWallace D. Wattles&#39; Financial Success Through the Power of Creative<br/>\nThought (better known these days as The Science of Getting Rich)<br/>\n<br/>\nWill Schultz&#39;s Profound Simplicity<br/>\n<br/>\nMaxwell Maltz&#39;s Psycho-Cybernetics<br/>\n<br/>\nEdward de Bono&#39;s The Mechanism of Mind<br/>\n<br/>\nNot the kind of books a new parent would usually think of to turn to<br/>\nfor advice. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it turned out, I&#39;ve always found it very difficult to explain<br/>\nthese books and their ideas in a parenting context. Even to the mother<br/>\nof my children.

That&#39;s why it&#39;s my<br/>\nsoapbox topic. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, there are problems with all of the books that my parenting<br/>\nphilosophy is based on. Wallace D. Wattles&#39; book is a &#39;New Thought&#39;<br/>\ntreatise written in 1910 that&#39;s based on some highly debatable<br/>\nmetaphysics, so I don&#39;t talk about that ever now. Besides which, I&#39;m<br/>\nnot a financial success (at the moment at least), so, even though I<br/>\ntranslated the book&#39;s ideas into parenting success, I can&#39;t claim that<br/>\nthey &#39;work&#39;. Profound Simplicity is written in a New Age context and<br/>\nI&#39;m not New Age at all. The Mechanism of Mind, in contrast, is so feet<br/>\non the ground it reads like a school text book. Very dull unless<br/>\nyou&#39;re truly fascinated by the subject matter. Probably<br/>\nPsycho-Cybernetics is the most useful of the books overall.<br/>\nBecause it was written in 1960, parts of it are very dated, but the<br/>\nsubject matter of &quot;self-image psychology&quot; gives it its importance. For<br/>\nme, our self-image is the key. <br/>\n<br/>\nLast year, I did try to extract the essential ideas from these books<br/>\nand create something of my own and I came up with an e-book called How<br/>\nI Parent.

Many came from Sandra and Pam and Joyce and others at the old Unschooling.com boards, then their websites and email lists.  But I decided long before that that I didn&#39;t want to be the same kind of parent that my mom was.  I just didn&#39;t quite know how to do it!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI always heard growing up that I was not living up to my potential.  I still hate that word, potential.  I got bad grades because it was just expected that I would get good ones, because I could.  My best friend in school had to work at school, she studied, did her homework, and still struggled.  I could ditch classes, not do any homework, and still do well on the tests.  I didn&#39;t want to stand out among my friends by doing well. I still sometimes hear that I have disappointed people by staying in little old Alamogordo and focusing on my son instead of becoming a doctor or something.  It used to really bother me, now it mostly bothers me if my son hears it, because I don&#39;t want him to worry that I feel like I settled.  I DON&#39;T feel that way at all, and I have talked with Richard (12) a little bit about that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of my experience in school, I thought that I would homeschool from the beginning.  I also thought that I would not use one of the typical curriculum types that I had seen, mostly because they seemed 1. just like school, and 2. religious.  I do not remember how I stumbled across the old unschooling.com boards, I tend to have little lapses in memory when it comes to things like that.  I may have smoked too much pot as a teenager.  :-&#92;    I am glad that I did though, I don&#39;t think I would have used a set curriculum, but I was a no-gun, no-violent game type of mom before I found unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read lots about attachment parenting when I was pregnant, and tried to be the best attachment-type parent that I could be, within the limitations of being a single parent and working.  Most of what I read came from the internet.  I wish that I had attended La Leche meetings, I was too afraid of groups of people to try them out.  I read whatever I could from them though.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think my parenting beliefs began after an incident while I was in high school.  I had a friend spending the night, and in the middle of the night my dog chewed up something that I loved, a stuffed animal.  I was furious, and I spanked her.  I didn&#39;t think anything of it, my mom and dad spanked, both me and the dogs, that was normal!  Well my friend told me that I should NEVER have kids, because I was too heavy handed. I spanked too hard.  I have never gotten that out of my head, I spanked too hard.  So it is ok to spank, but not too hard?  I did spank Richard twice when he was little, but I felt horrible afterwards, and I kept going back to what she said.  I decided that I would never spank again, any living thing.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI really didn&#39;t find lots of information out there that shaped me in a positive way, mostly I read things that I didn&#39;t agree with (before finding unschooling).  That was helpful though, it helped me to know how I didn&#39;t want to be.  I read lots on homeschooling and parenting boards, and argued with the more conservative parents.  I am so thankful for the people who volunteer their time on the unschooling websites, email lists, boards, etc.  Now it is easier to find information about how I DO want to be.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have to mention that my mom has turned into a wonderful grandmother.  She inspects child-care homes and centers, and tries to help them to be more unschooly, kind of!  I am glad that she is has become an awesome grandma for my son and nieces.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKaty J<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] self-improvement","postDate":"1205019467","msgId":32871,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBNEQ5N0VDLURCQTctNEZCMi04NDgyLTA4RDdCRTkyQ0VFMUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxNDMwMWM4ODE0NiQwNDEzNTlkMCQwYzNhMGQ3MCRAZjJzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwMEJCQUNCLTAzNjctNDYyQy05M0EyLTUzNUNDRTJGNDYxQ0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDAxNDMwMWM4ODE0NiQwNDEzNTlkMCQwYzNhMGQ3MCRAZjJzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":32868,"nextInTopic":32872,"prevInTime":32870,"nextInTime":32872,"topicId":32814,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I love to read - used to use it as a way of escaping my life when I was young.

I felt, quite literally, like the red-headed<br/>\nstep-child of lore, &#39;cept I was punished for being *good* and *smart* and<br/>\n*responsible* and all those other things I learned were important at school,<br/>\nbut didn&#39;t make any sense in my Real World. By 13, I was spending most of my<br/>\ntime at an aunt&#39;s house, by 15 I was officially moved out of their home.<br/>\nThe turn of the corner, the on-ramp to a different highway *system*<br/>\n(including some off-road touring) than my family&#39;s, came when I was 18 and<br/>\nhad my first serious boyfriend. Big Joe&#39;s sense of humor was a Living Virus<br/>\nI&#39;m glad to have been infected with!! He would *see* my childhood tales as a<br/>\nfilm reel and laugh and laugh and laugh, sometimes until he cried... at<br/>\nfirst it &quot;hurt my feelings&quot;... then he gently took me my the hand, led me<br/>\nover to his perspective and we *watched* those stories again -- OMG They&#39;re<br/>\nSO funny!! -- and right there, I began my journey of &quot;Don&#39;t take it<br/>\npersonally&quot;  and the development of my personal mantra, &quot;there&#39;s always room<br/>\nfor humor.&quot;<br/>\nThis lead to The Forum (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.landmarkeducation.com/landmark_forum.jsp)\">http://www.landmarkeducation.com/landmark_forum.jsp)</a>,<br/>\nwhich I cannot recommend enough. It is now formatted for three days and an<br/>\nevening of Ass Kicking; when I did it, it was TWO consecutive weekends and<br/>\nan evening of Serious Bullshit Take Down! Joe was fond of calling his/their<br/>\ntechnique &quot;Grabbing the Gold and shaking off the Shit&quot; (which I think is<br/>\nquite similar to Sandra&#39;s technique). I was part of this<br/>\norganization/movement for many years. In the years since, I&#39;m reminded of<br/>\nthis work in the writings of Wayne Dyer, Barbara Sher and most recently<br/>\nByron Katie, Don Miguel Ruiz.<br/>\nIt was impossible to have this much of Life&#39;s Shit shaken off of me NOT to<br/>\nuncover my God wounds and heal them too.

I became a Christian when I was 15 and about to do away with<br/>\nmyself. The positive, life-affirming philosophy of Christianity has made all<br/>\nthe difference to me. My biggest problem was that I had lost hope;<br/>\nrelationship with God gave it back.<br/>\n<br/>\n.         But I was still a pretty messed up person. Facing the realities of<br/>\nwhat growing up in my family was like was part of it - acknowledging the<br/>\nhatred and anger I had hidden deep down inside, owning it, feeling it, and<br/>\nthen letting it go; forgiving my parents, and finally coming to a place of<br/>\nblessing them even though I no longer have relationship with either of them.<br/>\nThis was a long and extended process and I don&#39;t think I would have had the<br/>\ncourage to do it if I hadn&#39;t known Jesus. Truly, He has been my greatest<br/>\nFriend.<br/>\n<br/>\n.         I love to read - used to use it as a way of escaping my life when<br/>\nI was young. I enjoy discovering and thinking about insights and ideas. Lots<br/>\nand lots of books have been helpful. In parenting, the greatest and most<br/>\nmeaningful influences have been John Holt, Charlotte Mason, and Sandra<br/>\nDodd&#39;s emails J<br/>\n<br/>\n.         By some miracle, I managed to marry an amazing man - even though<br/>\nstatistics seem to say that the odds were stacked against me and that many<br/>\npeople with my background end up marrying abusive husbands. He has always<br/>\nknown that children are people, and even before we had any, he set the stage<br/>\nfor us to treat children differently. He remains my greatest support,<br/>\nencourager, challenger, fellow thinker and adventurer. He loves me, I trust<br/>\nhim, and thus he is a very dependable mirror that I use to check up on my<br/>\nbehaviour, thinking and attitudes. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRegards<br/>\n<br/>\nCathy <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning]self-improvement","postDate":"1204997866","msgId":32853,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDQTRGNUE0MUJENzIyRS0xMzk0LTNENEVAV0VCTUFJTC1ERzEzLnNpbS5hb2wuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEyMDQ5ODc1NzkuNjQwLjI3MTEwLm00NUB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDEyMDQ5ODc1NzkuNjQwLjI3MTEwLm00NUB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":32847,"nextInTopic":32859,"prevInTime":32852,"nextInTime":32854,"topicId":32814,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"How about others here?

As I read messages and explore<br/>\nideas, thoughts, and reactions as well as the past I find that my mom did<br/>\nsome very &quot;unschooly&quot; things with me. Now, I actually went to school, but I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have a bedtime, I didn&#39;t have a curfew, I was allowed to swear in<br/>\nfront of them, they let me smoke (which I is the reason that I think I<br/>\n*don&#39;t* smoke now), and they &quot;let me&quot; date a 24 year old when I was 17 (a<br/>\nvery good thing since 10 years later we are still together and have 2<br/>\nbeautiful daughters).<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, I did go to mainstream parenting at first. I wasn&#39;t<br/>\ninvolved with LLL or much of any of that type of support. My main support<br/>\nwhen I had my oldest (I was 19 and not ready to parent) was my grandma, who<br/>\nhad very &quot;old fashioned&quot; parenting ideals. It wasn&#39;t until I had my<br/>\nyoungest, 4 years ago, that I started questioning mainstream and I did so<br/>\nbecause mainstream ways didn&#39;t work with her. I had to come up with more<br/>\ncreative better ways, but still slipped back into mainstream often.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found unschooling about 4 years ago. I got on the boards and realized that<br/>\n&quot;I could *never* let my kids...&quot; fill in the blank. Well, about a year ago<br/>\nmy best friend (of 24 years, and I am only 27 today) had a preemie baby<br/>\nafter trying for quite a few years to get pregnant and the baby died 18 days<br/>\nlater. That flipped my world upside down and I questioned everything.<br/>\nIncluding my parenting. We began saying &quot;yes&quot; more and more. By August we<br/>\nwere well on the path to &quot;radical&quot; unschoolers (for lack of a better term).<br/>\nI think we are all better for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, it was a series of things that let to my parenting today (as it usually<br/>\nis) including my mom (who dabbled in unschooly ways in her parenting), Lilly<br/>\n(my youngest who challenged the mainstream ways), and Isaac (who was just<br/>\none of those miracles who come, but don&#39;t stay for long).<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nAmanda<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://whatmykidstaughtme.blogspot.com/\">http://whatmykidstaughtme.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":239259628,"authorName":"Jane S.","from":"&quot;Jane S.&quot; &lt;janesutcliffe@...&gt;","profile":"jsutfran","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: self-improvement","postDate":"1204909276","msgId":32821,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZxcnNjcyt2NmgyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMEJCQUNCLTAzNjctNDYyQy05M0EyLTUzNUNDRTJGNDYxQ0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":32814,"nextInTopic":32847,"prevInTime":32820,"nextInTime":32822,"topicId":32814,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Byon Katie s books are the BEST.... esp. her first one..
