I&#39;m not a big fan of<br/>\n<br/>\nswimming in lakes and oceans. I will, but it&#39;s not as pleasant. I get a<br/>\nlittle<br/>\nantsy. Give me the pool anytime! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly (the worm lover, but NOT if they&#39;re under murky water!)****<br/>\n<br/>\nActually Kelly, I think I said that because this is the first summer in<br/>\nquite a while when we don&#39;t have access to a pool and I&#39;m a little down<br/>\nabout that.  I&#39;m trying to convince myself that we will have swimming<br/>\nfun despite no pool.  I actually don&#39;t care much for the swimming hole -<br/>\none of my best friends would get in there with the kids and swim, I<br/>\nstayed on the shore.  But she has moved and now it&#39;s up to me to get in<br/>\nthere and swim.  Wish me luck, maybe the yuck factor will be low this<br/>\nyear..<br/>\n<br/>\nKate<br/>\nwho loves to swim</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14368,"nextTopicId":14293}}
