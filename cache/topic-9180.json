I let it go for five<br/>\nmonths and decided he needed a little pushing to get him going.<br/>\nI don&#39;t control the tv, but I do remind him that, yes, Mom is working<br/>\ntonight<br/>\nand if they want to do anything they might want to not wait until an hour<br/>\nbefore I go to work.<br/>\nHELP!!!  It is getting  a little bit better, but it pains me to see him in<br/>\nthat room ALL day long, day after day after day....<br/>\nIs it partly the age?<br/>\nNothing in our house is worthy anymore. Not books, not art projects, it&#39;s<br/>\nall<br/>\nboring.<br/>\nThe almost teen thing might be part of it, the fact that I was ultra anti-tv<br/>\nfor a long time is probably part of it. So I grit my teeth and try to shut<br/>\nup.<br/>\nBut it&#39;s hard. He&#39;s out of shape and very hard to interest in anything<br/>\noutside his bedroom.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9179,"nextTopicId":9152}}
