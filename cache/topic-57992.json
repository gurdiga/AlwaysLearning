So,<br/>\nnow my toddler has renewed interest in the pureed baby food, watching her<br/>\nlittle sister eat it -- and the other day, I put a jar of it on her tray for<br/>\nher to play with and try.  She started dipping all her other food in it.<br/>\nShe was dipping some kind of noodles in pureed bananas.  She was loving it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this moment, she&#39;s eating mac and cheese with hot dog bites, and carrot<br/>\n*dip* (pureed carrots).<br/>\n<br/>\nAny age kids might find pureed baby foods fun to play with and dip other<br/>\nfoods into.  It&#39;s fun to experiment with the different textures and taste<br/>\ncombos.  And older kids might like to play with mixing different combos in a<br/>\nfood processor, making their own *baby* food.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57989,"nextTopicId":57931}}
