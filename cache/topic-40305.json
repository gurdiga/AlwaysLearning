(we have Uncles Games and some independently owned stores around here that are great for carrying top game titles that toy stores usually don&#39;t have)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Renee<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":342942830,"authorName":"Jay","from":"&quot;Jay&quot; &lt;jay.ford79@...&gt;","profile":"jay.ford79","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Christmas Gift Suggestions","postDate":"1227059645","msgId":40305,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdmdnJqdCtlazk4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":40309,"prevInTime":40304,"nextInTime":40306,"topicId":40305,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m looking for suggestions for games, puzzles, books, and other off- the-beaten path things to do to give as Christmas gifts and to also stash in the RV for","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1262737017\">I&#39;m looking for suggestions for games, puzzles, books, and other off-<br/>\nthe-beaten path things to do to give as Christmas gifts and to also <br/>\nstash in the RV for when we take road trips.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have the usual games (checkers, chess, cards) and many common board <br/>\ngames (Life, Scrabble, Monopoly etc), but are looking for something <br/>\ncool, new, and different.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found a few things on the Mental Floss site, but am looking for other <br/>\nsuggestions that you have had fun with in your families.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are 14 & 10.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nJay</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40317,"nextTopicId":40323}}
