It&#39;s really just  4 of his movies I think On Saturday around 7:30, 8 pm eastern time. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe latest one that was released was really really good &quot;Howl&#39;s Moving Castle&quot;  Princess Mononoke does have a more mature theme but my son seemed to pick up on the deep more spiritual meaning of the movie.  The same with Spirited Away.  I love how my son interprets the values and morals very enlightening. We love all of Hayao Miyazaki  movies. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was just recently that we learned about Japanese animation and it was another one of those things that was hard for me to appreciate and I wasn&#39;t too sure about letting my son watch them. I didn&#39;t understand them. My son got the meanings right way, where as it took me a few more time of watching to appreciate them. I guess I wasn&#39;t watching with a open mind.   My son teaches me more then I teach him when I let him. He&#39;s way more open minded then I am. But I&#39;m working hard at fixing that problem in my self.  Thanks for the links.
