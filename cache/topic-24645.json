And how the mistake was<br/>\nhandled. You&#39;re right, it reminds us that we are all human.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I personally don&#39;t want to DWELL on my mistakes, but can tell you<br/>\nthat at least weekly, and sometimes more often, I misstep in interacting<br/>\nwith my child(ren). Usually it is quite obvious, as by now we have a pretty<br/>\nsmooth situation as a family. My kids have no problem pointing out a<br/>\nmisstep, for sure (and they are often kind about such a thing). Sometimes<br/>\nit&#39;s something more subtle, and I will just &quot;feel&quot; like I did something<br/>\nwrong without really knowing what until I replay the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are teenagers, the oldest is 17, and we have been unschooling for<br/>\nquite some time. So one point is that the questioning and refining and<br/>\nconscientious thought haven&#39;t ended for me...I&#39;m not sure that any of us are<br/>\ncompletely &quot;there&quot; all the time. Part of unschooling is the commitment as<br/>\nparents to continue to think and be mindful of how we are acting with our<br/>\nchildren, and to be humble in acknowledging when we have made a mistake, and<br/>\nto make appropriate adjustments. It is a process. Most of us have many years<br/>\nof conditioning from our own upbringings, and for me, the triggers still<br/>\ncome sometimes. But because I do have a commitment to be respectful and<br/>\nsupportive of my children always, it is pretty easy to make changes. In fact<br/>\njoyful.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I get in &quot;reactive&quot; mode, rather than &quot;responsive&quot; or even<br/>\n&quot;reflective&quot; mode, both of which seem to serve my children and me better<br/>\n(except when there is a fire or a swerving car coming our way). In<br/>\nparticular, the whole time thing, you know...when someone has to be<br/>\nsomewhere by a certain time and yet people aren&#39;t ready...that sometimes<br/>\nmakes me start the tape &quot;Come on! Let&#39;s go! We all had a whole hour to get<br/>\nready...why aren&#39;t you all in the car??&quot; kinda thing. It&#39;s a response from<br/>\nmy days of needing to please others, as well as what was said to me as a<br/>\nchild.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I do think it is important and respectful to get to a place on time to<br/>\nour best ability when someone else is depending on it...it seems respectful<br/>\nto do our best to meet an agreement like this with another person. But<br/>\ninstead of the demeaning language and tone that I heard growing up, I have<br/>\nreplaced it with doing my best to help each and every person in whatever way<br/>\nthey may need get into the car. I remind a child to please use the restroom<br/>\n15 minutes before we leave...the child who often goes into the bathroom when<br/>\nwe are supposed to be going out the door. And make sure that everyone&#39;s<br/>\nshoes are lined up at the door. And load the car with whatever &quot;stuff&quot; is<br/>\nneeded so that it&#39;s already taken care of. Or make a list of &quot;to do&#39;s&quot; to<br/>\nhelp give everyone a visual reminder of what they may need to do. Or tell<br/>\nthe other person that we need a window rather than an exact time, and then<br/>\ngo for the earliest part of the window so that we have time for last minute<br/>\nneeds. These are all more effective than yelling &quot;Hurry up! Come on!!

First off I<br/>\nhave a 7 yr old, a 3 yr old and a baby. I feel pulled in all sorts of<br/>\nways. I look at friends who are *just* embarking on their parenting<br/>\n&quot;life&quot; and hear/see their ideal/ideas and thoughts and don&#39;t seem to<br/>\nhave much patience for their &quot;hard&quot; stuff. Then I talk to others whom<br/>\nI *completely* identify with in the moment with similar aged children.<br/>\nLastly, I have my friends who are so far past this &quot;childhood&quot; and<br/>\nwith grown children or teenagers. When I&#39;m feeling &quot;lost&quot; or confused<br/>\nwith my choices I have to both look behind and then forward to get to<br/>\n*my* present. We&#39;ve had a busy last few months.I am an artist with<br/>\npaint, pastel, pencil, etc...not with words, so you&#39;ll have to bear<br/>\nwith me ;). <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the last 6 mos we have uprooted, moved out of state, had a baby,<br/>\nand now my dh works at home. Okay, along with the &quot;move out of state&quot;<br/>\nwe have moved out of So CA (a place of vague seasonal awareness)and to<br/>\nWA (a place of acute! seasonal awareness). My usual comfort of friends<br/>\nwith like minds have all but vanished. Last week I found them BTW, in<br/>\na small, but intimate group (hope abounds!). <br/>\n<br/>\nSooooo, my main point of this whole post is that I *NEED* to hear<br/>\nthose confessions that Sandra put out there. The ones where others<br/>\nhave slipped up and been angry (out of pure frustration, tiredness,<br/>\nwhatever). It isn&#39;t that they slipped up or did angry wrong things<br/>\nthat gives me hope, it is the compassion and caring that goes into the<br/>\nproblem solving or the resolution that gives me inspiration.<br/>\n<br/>\n They help to make or mold me in-TO a better parent. I need to know<br/>\nyou all messed up along the way because of a VERY different past or<br/>\nwhatever it was... :( I appreciate the same honesty and<br/>\nforthrightness...(is that a word?). It is so cathartic to hear this<br/>\n*side* of your parenting journey. It sounds like I&#39;m trying to shoot<br/>\nfor a lower goal of some weird &quot;misery loves company&quot; ideal, but<br/>\ntruely it makes me think...ok these people are real, they make<br/>\nmistakes and tell their children they (themselves) were wrong and life<br/>\ngoes on in a better more connected way. <br/>\n<br/>\nAm I babbling a mental confusion of my convoluted thoughts or is this<br/>\njust something you have heard before and have a nice article for....;)<br/>\ncuzzz I needs ta hear it ch&#39;all ;).<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughtfully,<br/>\nTicia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Suggesting other ways","postDate":"1141266007","msgId":24673,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhFN0I4OTcxLTREMjMtNDUxNC1BQ0RBLTVCMzJFMkY4REQ3NkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGY1OTFkZGE4YmNjODAzMjMzNWFkODM1MWE4ZjM3ZDdjQGNoYXJ0ZXIubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDExNDEyNTE0MTguNDMxMi4yMzkxOC5tMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDxmNTkxZGRhOGJjYzgwMzIzMzVhZDgzNTFhOGYzN2Q3Y0BjaGFydGVyLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":24671,"nextInTopic":24682,"prevInTime":24672,"nextInTime":24674,"topicId":24645,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Taking the &quot;you <br/>\nshould&quot; out of it takes a lot of the defensiveness they would  react with <br/>\naway.

I have chosen this route with my <br/>\nbrother who has been through all sorts of ways to punish his daughters (my <br/>\nnieces). One time they were at my home and they spanked one of the girls for <br/>\ndoing something as innocuous as spilling some sand on my carpet from a <br/>\nlittle zen garden we had on the coffee table (I wish that were the worst <br/>\nthing on my carpet!). Since my brothers and I were all physically abused as <br/>\nchildren, I was mortified and after the girls went to bed I couldn&#39;t help <br/>\nmyself from telling him and his wife how much it bothered me. Of course <br/>\ntheir response was &quot;it was just a light pat - it didn&#39;t hurt her&quot;. I only <br/>\nreferred to my own experiences at that point and told them how I didn&#39;t <br/>\nremember any of the pain from the abuse as a child but that I can never <br/>\nforget the embarrassment, emotional pain and sadness at having someone I <br/>\nthought was supposed to love and protect me begin hitting me or pulling my <br/>\nhair, etc. I just said that even though I would not choose to parent the <br/>\nsame way, I realized that I didn&#39;t have a right to tell them how to raise <br/>\ntheir children, but that I could not allow that sort of response to occur in <br/>\nour home. They agreed and then later I think it sunk in and they turned to <br/>\nme and said, &quot;well what are we supposed to do? She never behaves!&quot; My only <br/>\ncomment was &quot;how is your current approach working? is it effective in <br/>\ngetting her to &#39;behave&#39;?&quot; Of course, they had no response but later they <br/>\nstarted thinking of other ways to respond to behavior they didn&#39;t like and <br/>\nno longer physically punish their children. Maybe soon they&#39;ll begin looking <br/>\nat a completely different way of approaching their children rather than from <br/>\nany punishment standpoint, but I consider that step a start.

As a child I was brought up the &quot;normal&quot; way with grounding etc  and said I wanted it to be different for my children however now that I  have them I am having trouble knowing exactly what to do. The issues  are, they fight among each other, my 7 year old daughter is mouthy etc.  They are basically very good kids and everyone comments on how well  behaved etc. they are but I find myself threatening to take things away  etc. and yelling. What comments do you have for me or what suggestes I  quess is what I am asking for. I feel I am doing something wrong if I  feel the need to yell, or take things away or threaten to anyway. Thank <br/>\n you again for listening and as far as your question, I think some of  those parents may welcome your advise because I sure would. (some of  them may actually want your advice and feel funning asking you).<br/>\n  Thanks again.<br/>\n  Lori<br/>\n<br/>\nJen and Scott Lynch &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:j.slynch@...\">j.slynch@...</a>&gt; wrote:          I am looking for ideas about what to say when another parent talks <br/>\n  about &quot;grounding&quot; their kids or &quot;revoking privileges&quot; or &quot;time outs.&quot;  <br/>\n  I am looking for ways to open a conversation with these parents about a <br/>\n  different way to be with their kids.
