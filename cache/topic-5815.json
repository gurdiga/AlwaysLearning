By the time you have <br/>\nyour Associate Degree and move on to a four-year college or university, how <br/>\nyou got there is pretty much forgotten.  Some folks are able to get into <br/>\ncommunity colleges without a GED and that is probably the preferred route, if <br/>\npossible.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA friend of mine organized a Homeschoolers College Night a couple years ago <br/>\nheld in the conference rooms of our public library.  She invited reps from <br/>\nvarious colleges in the area, community and four-year, as well as military <br/>\nrecruiters and tech school reps.  They were more than happy to come and <br/>\npresent their sales pitches &lt;g&gt; and answer all the many questions <br/>\nhomeschooling parents had regarding getting their kids into area colleges.  <br/>\nIt was informative and really rather easy to coordinate.  <br/>\n<br/>\n~Ginny<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2018196,"authorName":"sjogy@aol.com","from":"sjogy@...","profile":"sjogypls","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] GED Testing","postDate":"1016934800","msgId":5818,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3Ny41OTFjYjZlLjI5Y2U4YjkwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5817,"nextInTopic":5819,"prevInTime":5817,"nextInTime":5819,"topicId":5815,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/23/02 7:32:31 PM, alldone992000@yahoo.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1848684695\">In a message dated 3/23/02 7:32:31 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:alldone992000@...\">alldone992000@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Has anyone found it necessary to have a child take the GED Test? <br/>\nMaybe to get into college, satisfy state regulation, employer, or <br/>\nnervous relatives? :) &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have heard from several sources that if a child is college-bound, the GED <br/>\nis a bad idea.
