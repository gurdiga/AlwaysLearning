It is definitely <br/>\na load off of my shoulders. But the house still gets pretty trashed <br/>\nin between. I dont mind the toys being everywhere, what bothers me <br/>\nis the dirt. <br/>\nI have been simplifying alot. I used to use cloth daipers on my 2 yr <br/>\nold and 8 mo old but I recently switched to the seventh generation <br/>\nbrand. I found that the only laundry I was doing was daipers every <br/>\nday. And I just started using paper plates, actually picked up some <br/>\npaper bowls earlier. And started planning our menu with more frozen <br/>\nfoods. I was cooking gourmet meals but the kids didnt really like <br/>\nthem. I was trying to get my fix for cooking b/c I love to cook. But <br/>\nit just ended up being pointless in the end with expensive grocery <br/>\nbills, a big mess to clean and food that no one really liked but <br/>\nme.  The kids like everything really plain. Pasta, Brown rice, Baked <br/>\nChicken, Chicken nuggets so that is what I returned to getting. It <br/>\nwas worth the try. At least I know now. The boil in the bag rice <br/>\nrocks it only takes 8 min to cook rather than 45 min.<br/>\nI am really trying to make this work. <br/>\nI have been more observant and available to my 2yr old and have <br/>\nreally been applying the distraction method. It has been working <br/>\nvery well. And realizing when he is done being social and giving him <br/>\nsome personal space. That advice helped me alot. Sometimes I am at a <br/>\nloss for ideas on things to distarct him with but I am sure I will <br/>\nget more creative as time goes by. Sometimes things happen so <br/>\nquickly but I am doing my best to work with it.<br/>\nYou guys are awesome.

I think unschooling is enhanced when we do have  <br/>\nlots of things, but, still, your kids will be better served by having  <br/>\nfewer things if that means happier parents.<br/>\n<br/>\n2 - Have lots of bins and baskets around the house - wicker baskets  <br/>\nright in the living room and kitchen and bathrooms where you can just  <br/>\nput things throughout the day and can run around for a couple of  <br/>\nminutes before your husband gets home and get everything off floors  <br/>\nand furniture into the baskets.<br/>\n<br/>\n3 - Use paper plates and cups and plastic utensils throughout the day  <br/>\nso you don&#39;t have dishes to deal with before you even start thinking  <br/>\nabout dinner.<br/>\n<br/>\n4 - Simplify food preparation by using convenience foods - packaged  <br/>\nsalad, frozen foods, bags of carrots. Use boil-in-the-bag rice (Uncle  <br/>\nBens boil in the bag brown rice is great) - easy-to-clean pans. Lunch  <br/>\ncan be a bag of carrots, whole wheat crackers, and ranch dressing to  <br/>\ndip them into. Put them out on paper plates - let kids eat when  <br/>\nhungry. Don&#39;t &quot;make&quot; breakfast or lunch - provide convenient snack  <br/>\nstuff, instead. Don&#39;t make pots and pans or mixing bowls, etc.,  <br/>\ndirty, and you won&#39;t have to wash them.  Frozen foods are often  <br/>\nnutritious - don&#39;t disregard them thinking that they&#39;re not. Yes, you  <br/>\ncan eat cheaper if you make everything from scratch - but the extra  <br/>\ncost will be worth it if you end up happier. Cereal, fruit, milk are  <br/>\neasy - serve in paper bowls with plastic spoons.<br/>\n<br/>\n5 - Get a mother&#39;s helper to come in a couple of times per week for a  <br/>\ncouple of hours. She/he spends time playing with the kids while you  <br/>\nclean in ways you just can&#39;t get to with the kids needing you every  <br/>\nother minute. (They&#39;ll still need you some, but you can probably get  <br/>\nenough time to clean the whole toilet without interruption &lt;G&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\n6 - Even better, get a housekeeper to come in for half day once a  <br/>\nweek. This is a HUGE HUGE wonderful thing - in a half-day the  <br/>\nhousekeeper can do a lot. Yes, you&#39;ll have to clean up the clutter to  <br/>\nsome degree before the housekeeper can do a good job. If you do it  <br/>\nevery week, it won&#39;t be nearly as big a deal as you might think and  <br/>\nSO worth it. Leave the house to go play at the park for half a day  <br/>\nand come home to it being clean. Your husband might not think the  <br/>\nmoney is going to be well spent - ask him to try it for a month or  <br/>\ntwo, at least, then you can reconsider. Ask for it as a birthday  <br/>\npresent or maybe a belated mother&#39;s day present!  My mom gave me  <br/>\nhousekeeping services occasionally - for my birthday. Very nice gift!!<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Little habits are all-important. Don&#39;t think big or you might be  <br/>\noverwhelmed. Just do one thing and then another - little bits count.  <br/>\nYou will be amazed at how much less time cleaning up takes than what  <br/>\nyou probably think. Load or unload the top rack of the dishwasher  <br/>\nwhile you wait for toast to pop up or while something is in the  <br/>\nmicrowave for 1 minute. Later do the bottom rack. Never go anywhere  <br/>\nempty-handed - when you go from one room to another, take something  <br/>\nwith you - at least move things in the right direction &lt;G&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\n8 - have lots of trash cans around the house. Make it almost as easy  <br/>\nto put trash into a trash can as it is to leave it around.<br/>\n<br/>\n9 - spend lots of time outdoors. If you&#39;re not in the house, it won&#39;t  <br/>\nget as messy. Go places.<br/>\n<br/>\n10 - ???<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":116488337,"authorName":"Gold Standard","from":"&quot;Gold Standard&quot; &lt;jacki@...&gt;","profile":"jackiknouse","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Aggressive 2 yr old","postDate":"1180230075","msgId":28847,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHR0VKQ0dGQUIuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGYzYThmZis0OXVmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":28846,"nextInTopic":28848,"prevInTime":28846,"nextInTime":28848,"topicId":28839,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Let him know that you are pretty<br/>\nsure this is temporary, maybe a couple of years or so...that at your<br/>\nchildren&#39;s young and needy ages, they really need most of your time and<br/>\nenergy. Let him know that you have researched and learned that responding to<br/>\nchildren totally at their ages produces healthier and more independent<br/>\nchildren later, and that you just don&#39;t want to take any chances with that.<br/>\nTell him you know in your soul that this is how it is supposed to be.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t-See if you can find a way to leave the children with your husband for a<br/>\nday, or at least a few hours.

Children whose<br/>\nneeds are met this way consistently grow a natural independence that has the<br/>\nfringe benefit of being less demanding on mom, at least that&#39;s how it worked<br/>\nfor us.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t-&quot;Over the Shoulder Baby Holder&quot; was fabulous for us, they loved being worn<br/>\nmuch of the day. This allowed more freedom of movement for the other<br/>\nchildren, even when the babe was nursing. You are probably familiar with<br/>\nthis.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t-FORGET THE HOUSE. When I look at pictures of our lives back then, the<br/>\nsurrounding house was unbelievably trashed. I see now that my tolerance<br/>\nlevel for messiness then was quite admirable :o)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMy daughter the other day was talking of how she has great memories of the<br/>\ndoors at our old house. &quot;Doors?&quot; I asked. Yes, she says, she remembers that<br/>\none of them wanted to paint their door and soon everyone wanted to paint<br/>\ndoors and so she remembers me taking all the doors off the hinges and<br/>\nsetting them up at the kids&#39; levels like easels. I barely remembered that<br/>\n(those brain cells have been resting for a while), but lo and behold<br/>\npictures and videos indeed show doors off hinges, paint brushes, rollers,<br/>\nsponges and paints around (along with plates of food, toys, and rolls of<br/>\ntoilet paper, just to get a feel) and then there are pictures with the doors<br/>\nback on the hinges, all of them kid-created, facing the living room and<br/>\nkitchen and all the places that guests see, even though the doors were<br/>\nprobably only beautiful to us, no matching color scheme ya know :oP.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe house was indeed a mess. But the KIDS, they are carrying some lifelong<br/>\ncool memories. THEY don&#39;t remember a trashed house when they were little,<br/>\nthey only see that now when looking at pictures (and are surprised :o). They<br/>\nremember joy and creativity and happiness and support. And my kids never got<br/>\nhurt from our really really messy house. You know what I noticed back then?<br/>\nThey knew their environment. They carefully stepped over things. What a<br/>\ngreat skill!<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOur house today goes from mildly messy common space with some pretty messy<br/>\nclosed door rooms, to pretty darn clean, depending on who wants what when.<br/>\nThe house is still not first, even though my kids are now 18, 17, 15 and 13.<br/>\nThough the kids on their own clean different things at different times, and<br/>\nI&#39;ve noticed that in general, no one lets it get too messy anymore. They<br/>\nlike the clean space.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t-Know that you will have your time again. Really.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t-Do not get trapped into the nagging thought that you *need* more time to<br/>\nyourself. Make your time with your children &quot;your time&quot;. If you find<br/>\nyourself getting flustered, learn deep breathing exercises you can do in a<br/>\nmoment to relax and get back with the joy of your life right now, with your<br/>\nkids. They really do grow up, and this time right now is for the relishing.<br/>\nI think that we have been programmed to believe that we can&#39;t make it<br/>\nwithout that warm bubble bath or quiet book time regularly. This mindset can<br/>\nREALLY get in the way of a mom being with her children. I had maybe one<br/>\nbubble bath by myself in 10 years. I had MANY with my kids...much more<br/>\nenjoyable :o)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t-Back to the question about the aggressive 2yo. Poster said, &quot;I can&#39;t<br/>\nalways be there.&quot; Even though &quot;always&quot; is a pretty high goal, it should be<br/>\nthe goal. You can get pretty close I&#39;m guessing. Especially if you make that<br/>\n#1, above all else, for now. Wear the baby, be in the same room together,<br/>\nwatch carefully for precursors to the aggression. Then avoid or eliminate<br/>\nthe irritants. Add the things that she thrives on...physical games,<br/>\nhugging/holding...see what gives her joy and make them a part of her day<br/>\noften.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t-As far as food goes, we lived on finger foods for YEARS. It really can be<br/>\ndone, and easily. No one suffered from lack of a sit-down, well-prepared,<br/>\nhot meal...again, a mindset that can get in the way of what is really<br/>\nnecessary. Today we regularly have well-prepared, sit-down meals<br/>\ntogether...everyone knows how to use their utensils and have manners and<br/>\nsuch. Back then, none of that was necessary, and it didn&#39;t fit easily into<br/>\nour lives so we didn&#39;t do it. When we DID attempt it, the stress was just<br/>\nnot worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee what works most flowingly for your children and their joy, and make<br/>\ndecisions from that place.<br/>\n<br/>\nboythatwasalongone,<br/>\nJacki</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":239974035,"authorName":"Tina","from":"&quot;Tina&quot; &lt;kunjaana@...&gt;","profile":"kunjaana","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Aggressive 2 yr old","postDate":"1180191003","msgId":28844,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGYzOWhlcis2bmhrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIxM0I1NUI0MTE4RjQwQThCRjY2RTU4RDM1ODRFMEQyQFJvYnluUEM+"},"prevInTopic":28843,"nextInTopic":28845,"prevInTime":28843,"nextInTime":28845,"topicId":28839,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks alot.
