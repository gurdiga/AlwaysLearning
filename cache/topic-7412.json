I find that I am a way more relaxed homeschooler <br/>\nthan many since I move from NC to Michigan.  Homeschooling is different here than <br/>\nthere.  There are many who are more relaxed in NC than here in MI.  I can&#39;t quite call <br/>\nmyself an unschooler, but am relaxed.  I love the time that homeschooling gives me <br/>\nwith my two girls.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTarla<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; This discussion is very interesting to me. I used to be a cynical, <br/>\n&gt; often <br/>\n&gt; depressed, angry person at home. I couldn&#39;t understand why my <br/>\n&gt; daughter wasn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; &quot;good&quot; or &quot;normal&quot;, and tried to discipline her to prove i wasn&#39;t a <br/>\n&gt; BAD <br/>\n&gt; parent. I found the Lord in February 2000. I was baptised Catholic as <br/>\n&gt; an <br/>\n&gt; infant, but had no churching growing up. I had a distaste for <br/>\n&gt; anything <br/>\n&gt; remotely religious, couldn&#39;t read or listen to anything that was <br/>\n&gt; pushing the <br/>\n&gt; bible. Then one day God moved in me. I have been a member of a <br/>\n&gt; Baptist church <br/>\n&gt; for over 2 years now. I have never seen the vengeful God represented, <br/>\n&gt; but a <br/>\n&gt; loving and forgiving God. I don&#39;t believe in a religion, I believe in <br/>\n&gt; a <br/>\n&gt; RELATIONSHIP, religion is often the wrong way to go about it. I <br/>\n&gt; believe <br/>\n&gt; children have innocence, and free wills. I believe I model my life <br/>\n&gt; for my <br/>\n&gt; children, and if the fruit they see is what matters to them, they <br/>\n&gt; will want <br/>\n&gt; what I have. But they are free to choose whatever philosophy they <br/>\n&gt; feel is <br/>\n&gt; right. If i want to &quot;win&quot; my children to Christ, then I better make a <br/>\n&gt; life a <br/>\n&gt; powerful witness. My oldest almost 10yo daughter professed her faith <br/>\n&gt; not <br/>\n&gt; long after I did, when she was 7. I wasn&#39;t sure if she had the <br/>\n&gt; &quot;accountability&quot; or understanding, that maybe she was just following <br/>\n&gt; my <br/>\n&gt; example. So we have not yet discussed baptism, and she says she knew <br/>\n&gt; Jesus <br/>\n&gt; was real before I met him, before she knew His name. She leaned on <br/>\n&gt; Him when <br/>\n&gt; Mommy used to have rage and resentment and when I thought my child <br/>\n&gt; was doing <br/>\n&gt; things intentionally to get me mad. Boy have I come a long way. I <br/>\n&gt; think it <br/>\n&gt; was ingrained in me from the (lack of) parenting skills my father <br/>\n&gt; had. But <br/>\n&gt; God is good, faithful and very forgiving. He has led me to learn why <br/>\n&gt; I acted <br/>\n&gt; the way I did, what I can do daily to change and get better, and led <br/>\n&gt; me to <br/>\n&gt; homeschooling, unschooling, rebonding with my baby whom I was <br/>\n&gt; disconnected <br/>\n&gt; from for so long, because I was measured based on her public <br/>\n&gt; behavior. I <br/>\n&gt; have a very shameful history of poor parent conduct, desperate at <br/>\n&gt; times, and <br/>\n&gt; I daily have to wonder what I am accountable for in my daughters <br/>\n&gt; behavior and <br/>\n&gt; who she is due to the pain I subjected her to. I always knew I loved <br/>\n&gt; her, and <br/>\n&gt; thought that was enough, but one day the question occured to me does <br/>\n&gt; she know <br/>\n&gt; i love her, beyond a shadow of a doubt. I am so thankful to be where <br/>\n&gt; we are <br/>\n&gt; now, growing and loving and learning together, and all hope is not <br/>\n&gt; lost. <br/>\n&gt; Ironically, I was trying to train her and break her will before I <br/>\n&gt; found the <br/>\n&gt; Lord, and I don&#39;t feel that is the way He has led me since. He taught <br/>\n&gt; me to <br/>\n&gt; love her and accept her, nurture her and treasure her, the way He <br/>\n&gt; does me, <br/>\n&gt; His child. I believe he has shown me to trust my instincts that were <br/>\n&gt; previously mostly ignored, trying to trust &quot;experts&quot; that knew better <br/>\n&gt; than <br/>\n&gt; me. I wished I had coslept and carried my 10yo dd, the bond was being <br/>\n&gt; severed <br/>\n&gt; as early as my practice of &quot;separation parenting&quot;, which is the <br/>\n&gt; societal norm <br/>\n&gt; and direct opposite of attachment parenting that I practice with my <br/>\n&gt; subsequent children. If I come across any Southern Baptists or <br/>\n&gt; Christians who <br/>\n&gt; believe the way you portray, I would pray for them and not listen to <br/>\n&gt; them for <br/>\n&gt; a minute. It is also ironic that I am a homeschooler and Christian, I <br/>\n&gt; am not <br/>\n&gt; a homeschooler because it&#39;s the Christian thing to do, I am an <br/>\n&gt; unschooler <br/>\n&gt; because I am led to believe it is the parenting thing to do, I just <br/>\n&gt; happen to <br/>\n&gt; be a Christian. I have met some Christian homeschoolers, and joined a <br/>\n&gt; Christian group, but I am sure I am not like many of them!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I love this group and enjoy learning not only about unschooling, but <br/>\n&gt; learning <br/>\n&gt; so much about myself from the reflection here.

I used to be a cynical, often <br/>\ndepressed, angry person at home. I couldn&#39;t understand why my daughter wasn&#39;t <br/>\n&quot;good&quot; or &quot;normal&quot;, and tried to discipline her to prove i wasn&#39;t a BAD <br/>\nparent. I found the Lord in February 2000. I was baptised Catholic as an <br/>\ninfant, but had no churching growing up. I had a distaste for anything <br/>\nremotely religious, couldn&#39;t read or listen to anything that was pushing the <br/>\nbible. Then one day God moved in me. I have been a member of a Baptist church <br/>\nfor over 2 years now. I have never seen the vengeful God represented, but a <br/>\nloving and forgiving God. I don&#39;t believe in a religion, I believe in a <br/>\nRELATIONSHIP, religion is often the wrong way to go about it.  I believe <br/>\nchildren have innocence, and free wills. I believe I model my life for my <br/>\nchildren, and if the fruit they see is what matters to them, they will want <br/>\nwhat I have. But they are free to choose whatever philosophy they feel is <br/>\nright. If i want to &quot;win&quot; my children to Christ, then I better make a life a <br/>\npowerful witness.  My oldest almost 10yo daughter professed her faith not <br/>\nlong after I did, when she was 7. I wasn&#39;t sure if she had the <br/>\n&quot;accountability&quot; or understanding, that maybe she was just following my <br/>\nexample. So we have not yet discussed baptism, and she says she knew Jesus <br/>\nwas real before I met him, before she knew His name. She leaned on Him when <br/>\nMommy used to have rage and resentment and when I thought my child was doing <br/>\nthings intentionally to get me mad. Boy have I come a long way. I think it <br/>\nwas ingrained in me from the (lack of) parenting skills my father had. But <br/>\nGod is good, faithful and very forgiving. He has led me to learn why I acted <br/>\nthe way I did, what I can do daily to change and get better, and led me to <br/>\nhomeschooling, unschooling, rebonding with my baby whom I was disconnected <br/>\nfrom for so long, because I was measured based on her public behavior.  I <br/>\nhave a very shameful history of poor parent conduct, desperate at times, and <br/>\nI daily have to wonder what I am accountable for in my daughters behavior and <br/>\nwho she is due to the pain I subjected her to. I always knew I loved her, and <br/>\nthought that was enough, but one day the question occured to me does she know <br/>\ni love her, beyond a shadow of a doubt. I am so thankful to be where we are <br/>\nnow, growing and loving and learning together, and all hope is not lost. <br/>\nIronically, I was trying to train her and break her will before I found the <br/>\nLord, and I don&#39;t feel that is the way He has led me since. He taught me to <br/>\nlove her and accept her, nurture her and treasure her, the way He does me, <br/>\nHis child. I believe he has shown me to trust my instincts that were <br/>\npreviously mostly ignored, trying to trust &quot;experts&quot; that knew better than <br/>\nme. I wished I had coslept and carried my 10yo dd, the bond was being severed <br/>\nas early as my practice of &quot;separation parenting&quot;, which is the societal norm <br/>\nand direct opposite of attachment parenting that I practice with my <br/>\nsubsequent children. If I come across any Southern Baptists or Christians who <br/>\nbelieve the way you portray, I would pray for them and not listen to them for <br/>\na minute. It is also ironic that I am a homeschooler and Christian, I am not <br/>\na homeschooler because it&#39;s the Christian thing to do, I am an unschooler <br/>\nbecause I am led to believe it is the parenting thing to do, I just happen to <br/>\nbe a Christian. I have met some Christian homeschoolers, and joined a <br/>\nChristian group, but I am sure I am not like many of them!<br/>\n<br/>\nI love this group and enjoy learning not only about unschooling, but learning <br/>\nso much about myself from the reflection here.

Please answer that, at least on <br/>\nthe side, because I truly personally want to know.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe two choices you have gven above are both wrong, per Christianity.  The <br/>\noverwhelming belief of people in the English speaking world, and if not of <br/>\nthiions is this:   Children are born sinful, and willful, and must have that <br/>\ntrained out of them.  They must have their wills broken.  They must learn to <br/>\nobey, and not to act on their own (sinful) desires.<br/>\n<br/>\nChurch has taught that for a long time. <br/>\nUniversities have taught (falsely, but maybe hopefully) that there are no <br/>\nhuman instincts.  They have all been extinguished.  Humans can only learn <br/>\nfrom the writings of humans who came before them.   If pressed, they would <br/>\nprobably find their philosophy meeting the church and it would come down to <br/>\nwhat SEEMS like instinct is a selfish desire and will lead to sin.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you say &quot;What!?  No instinct?   No adrenaline, desire for revenge, no <br/>\nsexual urges??&quot;   All sins.  Anger is a sin, in the Bible.    What about <br/>\nmothering instincts, though?  The desire to carry a child around and sleep <br/>\nwith him?  SIN SIN SIN.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be nice if I were just talking about a hundred years ago, but I&#39;m <br/>\ntalking about now, in your own town, wherever you are, there are people who <br/>\nbelieve those things STRONGLY.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo neither the perfection nor the empty-vessel model, although they&#39;ve both <br/>\nbeen discussed by a few people for generations, can overcome the born-in-sin <br/>\nmodel.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt birth a child inherits the sin of Adam.  Satan has an advantage in the <br/>\nfight for his soul, and so the parents have to work HARD to bring the child <br/>\ninto the fold by the time he is old enough to decide whether to be a good <br/>\nChristian or not (the age of accountability), and if the child isn&#39;t quite <br/>\ntrained by that time (age estimates vary from nine to fourteen or so on that, <br/>\nand judging by the ages Baptist kids make their professions of faith if <br/>\nthey&#39;re immersed in the church and haven&#39;t been out being tempted by sin), <br/>\nhis soul could be lost BECAUSE of....   bad parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we&#39;re full circle.  If the people taking care of that two year old girl <br/>\nbelieve her eternal soul is in their control and she is just being willful <br/>\nand sinful, they WERE being &quot;good parents&quot; to try to make her do what adults <br/>\nwant done.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a huge, gigantic, continent-sized iceberg of a problem.<br/>\nAnd what&#39;s juxtaposed right over it is the Christian Homeschooling Movement.  <br/>\nHSLDA and all their associates.

One of these women, has all three of her children on Ritalin<br/>\n(sp?). How does this happen?   Her daughter is one of Dylan&#39;s friends. <br/>\nWhen she was five or six and in kindergarten the teacher couldn&#39;t stand<br/>\nher and made her sit in the hall.   One teacher&#39;s aid I know told me she<br/>\nspent the entire year in the hall.  So, she&#39;s almost twelve now and has<br/>\nbeen on medication for half her life, at least.  The first time she came<br/>\nto our house without her mom, I had cookies on the table and she asked if<br/>\nshe could have one.  I told her yes.  Could she have two?  Three?  I told<br/>\nher to eat them all if she thought her stomach could take it.  She asked<br/>\nto play the piano, to look at the violin, to go into my room, to count<br/>\nthe money in my piggy bank, to cook dinner for us.  There wasn&#39;t anything<br/>\nshe couldn&#39;t do here and she chose to sit and draw with Dylan and watch a<br/>\nmovie. (And cook dinner, which was delicious)  Her mom was astounded when<br/>\nshe came to get her, to find her &quot;troubled&quot; daughter happily quiet and<br/>\ncalm.   This scenario has repeated now several times and her mom  asked <br/>\nlast Wednesday if I would  &quot;homeschool&quot; her next year.   What is this?  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other mom has let the school tell her exactly how to raise her son<br/>\nand exactly what they expect and she has complied in her own words<br/>\n&quot;sometimes against&quot; her better judgement.  WHY?      <br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday while setting up for the library book sale I met a lovely<br/>\nlittle girl .  Two women there, the foster mom and her friend were<br/>\nkeeping track of this little person.  She was wonderful, singing, playing<br/>\nin boxes, talking nicely with all the helpers.  The commandants &quot;had to&quot;<br/>\ncorrect her,  frequently.  I said, as sweetly as I could, that she wasn&#39;t<br/>\na mistake, and therefor needed no correction and they all laughed and<br/>\nsaid how difficult it is to discipline her because she&#39;s so cute, blah,<br/>\nblah.  Discipline?   She&#39;s TWO!  They never missed an opportunity to stop<br/>\nher from having fun and that&#39;s all she was doing, because she  wasn&#39;t<br/>\nwildly running about risking injury or destruction of property.   One of<br/>\nthese women know&#39;s Dylan and in a discussion about &quot;discipline&quot; I told<br/>\nthem he had never been spanked or time outed (?) or otherwise &quot;punished&quot;<br/>\nand I told them that I really believed  &quot;bad&quot; behavior in a child wasn&#39;t<br/>\nreally bad behavior, but bad parenting.  When we fail to meet their needs<br/>\nwe don&#39;t have the right to punish them for getting frustrated.  It won&#39;t<br/>\nmake any difference in their thinking, but they asked.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think it has to do with what adults see children as.  Are they<br/>\nbeings who deserve respect and dignity or are they empty vessels,<br/>\nessentially worthless unless they are controlled by us and filled with<br/>\nour goodness and rightness and knowledge.   It&#39;s more than trusting that<br/>\nthey will learn, it&#39;s knowing that they are people.  How can you do the<br/>\nfirst, if you don&#39;t really believe the second? <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m depressed just thinking about the lives of these children.   I&#39;m<br/>\noffended that big people can drug and hit little people and it&#39;s lawful<br/>\nand acceptable.  I amazed that grown mothers of precious children don&#39;t<br/>\nbelieve they are perfect, and right and more important than any school<br/>\nsystem or any order from God.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L, going bird watching with a remarkable, interesting, most excellent<br/>\nson.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7432,"nextTopicId":7453}}
