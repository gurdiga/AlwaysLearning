So after reading a bunch of stuff off <br/>\nthe adutls menu, she finally decided on fried clams.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday we ended up going to red robin again (long story, we don&#39;t usually <br/>\neat out this must) and I asked her if she had liked the clams. She said <br/>\n&quot;only the inside.&quot;  I realized that all the breading that she had left <br/>\nin front of her on the table had been on purpose, she had been taking <br/>\noff the breading and eating only the clams. <br/>\nToday she again didn&#39;t want anything on the children&#39;s menu. INstead, <br/>\nshe wanted fajitas. <br/>\nShe was espeically interested in the onions. <br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In a message dated 4/8/03 6:47:02 AM Central Daylight Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; As far as food issues and food freedom, I myself feel that young<br/>\n&gt; children need to be guided and encouraged with what they eat.
