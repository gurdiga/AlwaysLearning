It doesn&#39;t - not in the way you think. There Are different ways to learn different things, but those differences cut across &quot;academics&quot; - learning to write is more like learning to draw or build than learning to read, for instance. And learning about literacy in a general sense Is a sponge-like process which derives from interacting with the world. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;things like puzzles and Eyewitness<br/>\n&gt; books are good, anything resembling a workbook/sheet is almost always bad.<br/>\n&gt; But I feel as though I&#39;m having a hard time balancing between the two.

If she likes to snuggle up and read stories with you, or play with a puzzle, then do those things- but do them because they&#39;re fun. If she&#39;d rather read something else, or not read at all that&#39;s fine too. My daughter wasn&#39;t one to cuddle up and read, but still learned to read because language and print is all around her. Don&#39;t try to teach or &quot;help her learn&quot; in some specific way, instead Watch her learn, see the different ways she learns already so you can be responsive when she wants help learning something in ways that work for her. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, five is too young for a lot of kids to be reading - the majority of kids aren&#39;t developmentally ready to be reading at 5. Seven is more &quot;average&quot; in that sense, although there are kids who aren&#39;t ready to read until puberty. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":231154952,"authorName":"Pam Laricchia","from":"Pam Laricchia &lt;pam@...&gt;","profile":"learn2day2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] focusing on the learning","postDate":"1336219037","msgId":67045,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRGQTUxNTlELjMwMzA2MDRAbGl2aW5nam95ZnVsbHkuY2E+","inReplyToHeader":"PENBQkdBM1dweHE2dU1OYVd3aWJRK0JnY25VMUgtbTZReUZIbXhxUm1yMWJlVkdFNV9Nd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBQkdBM1dweHE2dU1OYVd3aWJRK0JnY25VMUgtbTZReUZIbXhxUm1yMWJlVkdFNV9Nd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":67043,"nextInTopic":67046,"prevInTime":67044,"nextInTime":67046,"topicId":67043,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" The","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1399996167\">&lt;&lt; Learning in the sense of reading, writing, etcetera, I mean, rather than in the natural sponge-like way she soaks up all sorts of interesting stuff. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;natural sponge-like way she soaks up all sorts of interesting stuff&quot; IS real learning.
