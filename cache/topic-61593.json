It doesn&#39;t help them learn about the world beyond assuring them that &quot;people suck&quot; - and really, kids have plenty of opportunities to learn that, no matter how often and well you set them up for success. Talking about why rules exist can help, as well as talking about why adults think it&#39;s okay to treat children like they do. It helps kids - and parents! - see other people more compassionately rather than antagonistically. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":301108410,"authorName":"Marina DeLuca-Howard","from":"Marina DeLuca-Howard &lt;delucahoward@...&gt;","profile":"matedgirl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Kids Behaving Badly spinoff","postDate":"1308336154","msgId":61633,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBTkxrVGltRVNVWkdVNW5qQ1l2ZVlXcEotQXZ3QjNDY0RBQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBTkxrVGk9N21TK0pib3FrbXQzZ2kzcFVCKzhCQlc1YnNRQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGl0YXA0bitjOHI4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8MzJBQjdCMzQtRDdDRi00MUE3LTgxOUMtMkM3MUQxMEIwMEI1QGZyaWkuY29tPgk8NzAxMTkzLjE0NzM0LnFtQHdlYjQ1MzE2Lm1haWwuc3AxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4JPEJBTkxrVGltUzc3clN4dEhfWEJtX0wyLUtZLWVrak9jdGhRQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgk8QkFOTGtUaT03bVMrSmJvcWttdDNnaTNwVUIrOEJCVzVic1FAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":61632,"nextInTopic":61634,"prevInTime":61632,"nextInTime":61634,"topicId":61593,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Dangerous behaviour is dangerous no matter who, or rude behaviour is rude no matter who is doing it--but the manner in which we respond is sometimes to shame","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-234312068\">Dangerous behaviour is dangerous no matter who, or rude behaviour is<br/>\nrude no matter who is doing it--but the manner in which we respond is<br/>\nsometimes to shame kids, whereas we might firmly tell an adult<br/>\nrespectfully to stop something.(smoking comes to mind or speaking<br/>\nloudly when there is an infant napping)<br/>\n<br/>\nMarina<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 17/06/2011, Marina DeLuca-Howard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:delucahoward@...\">delucahoward@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Another idea would be...what if an adult were doing it?

And it doesn&#39;t have to be two <br/>\nextremes - play in the revolving door versus sit quietly. But In a <br/>\nhospital waiting room? Mostly, yes, you should have things for them to <br/>\ndo so that they can sit and do something quiet or maybe walk around <br/>\nquietly if it is a large enough space that they can do that without <br/>\nbothering others. We were in a hospital waiting room for many hours a <br/>\nfew months ago and I wandered around looking at photographs they had on <br/>\nthe walls. I waited until people moved to look at the ones above their <br/>\nheads. People in hospital waiting rooms very likely have problems on <br/>\ntheir minds and I&#39;d try to be especially courteous and unobtrusive in <br/>\nthat environment. A few times around in the revolving door with you <br/>\nstanding right there would seem fine, to me, but letting the kids play <br/>\nin the revolving door while I sat in a chair a little ways away from <br/>\nthem, doesn&#39;t seem horrible, but not okay, either. People approaching <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t know if the kids would have enough sense to not push it too <br/>\nfast once they got in, for example, or to stop it to let me get out.  I, <br/>\nmyself, would not step into a revolving door with a couple of young <br/>\nchildren pushing it around because I have osteoporosis and I&#39;d worry <br/>\nthat if they pushed too fast for me, or if I was trying to exit and they <br/>\nsuddenly started pushing it, and I stumbled, I could break a bone. On <br/>\nthe other hand, if the hospital waiting room was pretty much empty - if <br/>\nwas the middle of the night, for example, and I could stand right there <br/>\nwith them, I might have let my kids go round and round in that door as <br/>\nlong as they wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":224796703,"authorName":"otherstar","from":"&quot;otherstar&quot; &lt;otherstar@...&gt;","profile":"casouthworth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Kids Behaving Badly spinoff","postDate":"1308171246","msgId":61596,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY3N0U5QjE1MjkwMjRCNTI5RjY2MkIzQTIyQkI4REZCQEplZmZIUD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGl0YXA0bitjOHI4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGl0YXA0bitjOHI4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61595,"nextInTopic":61597,"prevInTime":61595,"nextInTime":61597,"topicId":61593,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From: Lydia Sent: Wednesday, June 15, 2011 12:11 PM To: AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Kids Behaving Badly spinoff ...

Any accident that happens on the premises must be reported. When I was working in a college library, I did not want people getting hurt on my watch because that meant that I would have to fill out an incident report. It also meant that I would be questioned about the situation. Even though we had signs that said “no unattended children,” I would be questioned as to where I was and why I didn’t do something about the situation. It was not my job to try to make guesses as to whether or not a child was being properly monitored. It was my job to keep the library as safe as possible for all users, which meant saying something to patrons that were disturbing others or were not  properly monitoring their children. I am sure that I irritated a few parents for asking them to keep a closer eye on their children. I was not willing to jeopardize my job so a completely unknown kid could play or explore in the college library. <br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":147283564,"authorName":"Jill Parmer","from":"Jill Parmer &lt;jparmer@...&gt;","profile":"jparm02","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Kids Behaving Badly spinoff","postDate":"1308170454","msgId":61595,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMyQUI3QjM0LUQ3Q0YtNDFBNy04MTlDLTJDNzFEMTBCMDBCNUBmcmlpLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGl0YXA0bitjOHI4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGl0YXA0bitjOHI4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61594,"nextInTopic":61596,"prevInTime":61594,"nextInTime":61596,"topicId":61593,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

First let me give you an example that happened last week, so you know exactly to what behavior I am referring.  Last week I took my 6 and 8 year old along to my teenager&#39;s cardiologist appointment.  We had to wait in the hospital lobby until it was our turn.  The lobby had a revolving door with four sections that my kids found interesting.  They asked if they could go around in the revolving door.  They each got in one section and pushed the door slowly around and around.  When some one approached from the outside they stopped the door to allow the person to enter an empty section, but the person went over to the regular door and they continued going around.  They only did this for 1 to 2 minutes before a hospital volunteer approached them and asked them to stop, saying she didn&#39;t want them to get hurt.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was sitting very close to them got up when she approached them and led them back over to sit with me telling them they would have to sit down now because the hospital did not allow them to go around in the door. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids were not loud (they weren&#39;t talking at all) or boisterous and were merely enjoying walking around and around.  They were not being unsafe.  It seems more and more that it makes some people nervous if kids in public are doing anything other than sitting quietly. Should I just help my kids to sit quietly in public?  I can and do bring things for them to do while we are waiting, but sometimes there are interesting things that they want to explore and I like to let them do so if it doesn&#39;t disturb others.  My problem is that the kids seem to disturb others when I am unaware that their behavior is disturbing. Even now, looking back on the incident, I don&#39;t understand why they were asked to stop other than they were not sitting in a chair like everyone else.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":61664,"nextTopicId":61667}}
