She loves being here. I did<br/>\nnotice, however, that when I was feeling particularly<br/>\nhomesick, Tamzin picked up on it and started to become<br/>\nhomesick herself. Like someone else said, as they make<br/>\nfriends and connections (and you as well) I&#39;m sure it<br/>\nwill pass. Going across country on a great adventure<br/>\n(like you were talking about before) would be a great<br/>\nway to take all of your minds off being homesick.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeghan :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend FREE video emails in Yahoo!
