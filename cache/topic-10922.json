The<br/>\nduffer in English birds disguises them so that they shall look like<br/>\nforeigners...Among the swag-shopkeepers, at one place in Houndsitch more<br/>\nespecially, are dealers in &quot;duffing-fiddles&quot;.   These are German-made<br/>\ninstruments, and are sold to the street-folk at two shillings, sixpence,<br/>\nor three shillings, bow and all.   Then purchased by the music-duffers,<br/>\nthey are discoloured so as to be made to look old.  A music-duffer,<br/>\nassuming the way of a man half-drunk, will enter a public-house, or<br/>\naccost any party in the street, saying  &quot;It cost me two guineas and<br/>\nanother fiddle... but I may as well be my own broker, for I must have<br/>\nmoney anyhow, and I&#39;ll sell it for ten shillings.&quot;  <br/>\n--Henry Mayhew&#39;s &quot;London Labour and the London Poor,&quot; 1851<br/>\n<br/>\nFriday 22 November:<br/>\nFeast day of St. Cecilia, a patroness of musicians.
