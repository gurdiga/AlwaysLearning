She says whenever she thinks about her wishes (dreams) she gets sad.  She feels as though they are unattainable.<br/>\n<br/>\nA little history on us,  she went to preschool-1st and had always enjoyed school.   We started homeschooling because my ds, 10, was really unhappy in school.   I asked her if she wanted to be home or at school,  she chose home.  So we&#39;ve been unschooling for 1 year now.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat she was sad about last night was that she wants to do voices for cartoons.    We were watching Rurouni Kenshin, and they had outtakes from when the actors were screwing up.  It was really funny.      <br/>\n<br/>\nShe likes to imitate other characters/actors voices,  with accents and such,  loves doing Hermione&#39;s accent,  Fat Bastard&#39;s from Austin Powers,  you get the picture.    She also thinks she would like to be an actor but thinks she&#39;ll be afraid to go on stage,  so that was depressing her.  She is signed up to be in a play this summer with her little sister so that will be a good experience.   I told her this might be the way to work up to the voice parts in cartoons.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just don&#39;t know what to tell her,    I feel really helpless.   We live in a smaller town and the plays are the only thing I can think of for her to possibly attain her dream.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe also loves all sorts of art, so we do as much of that as we can.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think I should just let her vent and it should pass.     Anyone have suggestions on the whole voice over stuff?   What else I could suggest for her?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOh,  I just thought of what my SIL said one time when she heard that Abbi was sad,  &quot;maybe she should be in school,  she might be too much of an extrovert to be happy at home.&quot;  She&#39;s a teacher!
