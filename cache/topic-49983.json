Something got broken in your  <br/>\nparents, probably long before they had kids. Or maybe it&#39;s genetic.  <br/>\nWho knows. There are probably 50+ years of building walls to protect  <br/>\nthem from whatever hurt them (maybe their own parents who sent them  <br/>\naway?) No matter how wonderful the tap dancing you do outside their  <br/>\nwalls, the walls will only come down if they decide they don&#39;t need  <br/>\nthem any more. (Which is unlikely after all this time.) It&#39;s not  <br/>\nabout you. You can&#39;t tap dance away what they&#39;re protecting  <br/>\nthemselves from.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may have some image you want your family to fill in your life.  <br/>\nBut is that any more right than parents who picture their children as  <br/>\ndoctors and are disappointed when they become artists or guitar  <br/>\nteachers? Let your family be who they are. If you&#39;re looking for  <br/>\nsomeone to fill a role in your life, explore interests and meet new  <br/>\npeople. Visit retirement homes and adopt some grandparents who are  <br/>\nextroverts and love kids.
