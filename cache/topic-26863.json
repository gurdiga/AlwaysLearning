Her process is so much fun to watch I <br/>\nwanted to share a bit of it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOlivia has always been curious about most everything and loves to be <br/>\nread to and in the last couple of weeks she has been copying words <br/>\non to the blackboard wall in our kitchen and calling out long <br/>\nstrings of letters and asking me, &quot;What does that spell?&quot;  Yesterday <br/>\nshe said, &quot;Mommy don&#39;t look,&quot; when she wrote on the board <br/>\nand when she asked me to look she had written the word &quot;LEGO.&quot;  I <br/>\nwas amazed not only that she could write the word but that she had <br/>\nseen it on a Lego container and remembered it--she wasn&#39;t looking at <br/>\nthe word when she wrote it!  Then she wrote the number 10 and asked <br/>\nme which number that was. Her process is so amazing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been unschooling for 2 years now and our house has become a <br/>\nmore peaceful and  a happier place to be.  I&#39;ve learned to trust my <br/>\nchildren and I am a better parent and a better thinker.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the beginning of our homeschooling I bought a curriculum and our <br/>\nexperiment with school at home lasted about day when I realized it <br/>\nwas completely offensive to my older daughter (and to me!)  Sarah (7 <br/>\nyears now) wanted nothing to do with school at home but we did enjoy <br/>\nreading some of the books and using up the stuff that came with it.  <br/>\nOtherwise it was an expensive ($500) lesson on stuff we don&#39;t need.  <br/>\nMoney we now spend on trips and museums and stuff the kids want or <br/>\nare interested in.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, this long post is to say how exciting life is when you <br/>\ntrust your children and support them--and to say thank you to the <br/>\nexperienced unschoolers who post here.  I&#39;ve learned so much but I <br/>\ndo get frustrated with newbies who post and then seem to fight every <br/>\nbit of wisdom that is so graciously given.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, my mother told me today that Sarah needed to be in a Montessori <br/>\nSchool (?!) and I told her, no, Sarah is better off home with me.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26894,"nextTopicId":26875}}
