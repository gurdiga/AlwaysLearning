I probably wouldn&#39;t have done as well as you did.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s interesting to think, though, of how many families pay a counsellor big money to help them untangle their hostilities and aversions to one another, when maybe if they could have been more patient about spills, breakages, mistakes, broken vending machines or games, they would still be a head financially, if it prevented the counselling.  And they would be on a whole better trajectory, emotionally.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t work for Brits, but this is a note to Americans:  If you go to the U.K., go to an arcade.  Any seaside town will have a big one.  Get a one pound coin, or a 50p piece.  Go to the change machine and get change.  THAT IS IT!!!  THE HUGE WIN!!!  It&#39;s like a slot machine in Las Vegas.

After a bit of zombie shooting and some air hockey, he chose a game where the balls fall down and you steer the bucket underneath them. We put our pound in, the balls came down, and... the bucket was stuck. We spoke to the staff member who said she couldn&#39;t give us our money back as they didn&#39;t own the machine, I&#39;d have to call the games machine company in another city.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first thing to go through my head was to complain, to say how ridiculous it was, to ask to see the manager, to say how I knew it didn&#39;t have to work like that as I&#39;d had games machines in my restaurants, how unfair it was that they were just going to keep our money (this is what my parents would have done when I was a kid, and they would have gone on about it all evening too)... then I remembered the things I&#39;d been reading about negativity, and thought, really? I&#39;m going to let frustration over one pound infuse Jay&#39;s evening with negativity?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I smiled and said, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; and empathised with Jay and asked him what he fancied playing instead, and we went on to continue having a fun night together. In the car on the way home in the dark he looked at me and sighed and said, &quot;Mummy? I love Mummy and Jay time. We had lots of fun! We go there again soon?&quot; And I could honestly say yes I&#39;d had fun, without having tainted it with a moan or a complain. And yes we&#39;d go again. It took effort that time to keep the irritation in my head, but hopefully the more I can focus on not bringing negativity the more naturally it will come.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nTam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70926,"nextTopicId":70947}}
