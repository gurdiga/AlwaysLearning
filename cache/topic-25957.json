He sent the whole text, which I don&#39;t want to  <br/>\ndo here, but for those of you whose incalcitrent relatives are  <br/>\nwanting &quot;proof,&quot; there might be things in that (and that site in  <br/>\ngeneral) you can use to quote.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a section:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-       Considerable research has shown that students learn much  <br/>\nmore easily when they self-learn. As long ago as 1930,  the &quot;8 Year  <br/>\nStudy&quot; of 30 special schools demonstrated that: &quot;The most effective  <br/>\nschools used a different approach to learning.  Instead of organizing  <br/>\nlearning by subjects, they organized it around themes of significance  <br/>\nto their students.&quot; There seemed to be an inverse relationship  <br/>\nbetween success in college and formalized education as opposed to  <br/>\nstudent selected learning.<br/>\n-=-       A recent Cornell University study confirmed this and showed  <br/>\nthat schooled children become &quot;peer dependent&quot; while those who  <br/>\nlearned with their parents have more self-confidence, optimism, and  <br/>\ncourage to explore. A Moore Foundation study of children of parents  <br/>\nwho had been arrested for truancy found that their homeschooled  <br/>\nchildren ranked 30 percent higher on standard tests than the average  <br/>\nclassroom child.<br/>\n-=-       Providing possible insight into the reasons behind these  <br/>\nsuccesses, a UCLA project showed that the average schooled student  <br/>\nreceives 7 minutes of personal attention a day but the self-learner  <br/>\nreceives from 100 to 300 minutes of attention daily. Following this,  <br/>\na Smithsonian Report on genius concluded that high achievement was a  <br/>\nresult of time with responsive parents, little time with peers, and  <br/>\nconsiderable time for free exploration.<br/>\n-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, Isaac, for stirring that up for us.  I&#39;ve been to that site  <br/>\nbefore, but it&#39;s good to be reminded, and this list gets new members  <br/>\nconstantly.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25921,"nextTopicId":25937}}
