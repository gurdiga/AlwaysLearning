She is in school this year, her choice. Never had been before and totally able to handle the system. Anyhow, she wishes she was skinnier. She has been off the growth charts until 5 years old, for her age, now she is right at 98% for height and weight. Well, she thinks her legs are fat and she doesn&#39;t like this. Also, she told me someone at school has been teasing her about having fat legs, yuck! Her class gets to go swimming and I think she is feeling strange about being in her bathing suit in front of her class. She wants me to make her a swim skirt. This is a kid who has spent her whole life in a swim suit and was on the swim team for a year. She loves to swim. I&#39;m trying to come up with some resouces so we can explore what she is feeling. Any thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nMary H.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13789,"nextTopicId":13796}}
