Some people don&#39;t like it, but will endure<br/>\nit to keep peace, or to have the physical touch.  She might sometimes<br/>\nprefer just softer touching but not want to admit it, or not fully<br/>\nrealize it.  Even though it makes people laugh, tickling can be<br/>\ninvasive and sometimes painful.  And sometimes there IS something<br/>\nthat needs to be said after that deep breath or two, it just needs to<br/>\nbe in a gentle form.

I think my not liking the tickling thing comes from my sister<br/>\ntickling me when we were kids.  She was bigger and would hold me down.  She<br/>\nwould put her knees on my elbows and my underarms were exposed.  It did not<br/>\ntickle, but hurt.  Eventually, being the limber one and quite tall, I<br/>\nrealized that I could throw my legs up over, around her back and around the<br/>\nfront part of her neck.  I would take her down and almost knock the wind out<br/>\nof her, giving me time to get away.  Thankfully, Dave is the wrestler in the<br/>\nfamily and many nights the two of them (dd and daddy) have matches.
