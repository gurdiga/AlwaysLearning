My son is also 6 and was pretty much just like your son before and after he received Lego Racer.  He would wake up at 4:00am with that game on his mind and play for hours on end.   It took him about 2 months to completely master it and these days he has moved on and rarely do I hear that little lego racer tune coming from the computer room.  By the way, have you ever tried to play it yourself?  I have a very difficult time just staying on the track. My opinion is do not interfere because he is being challenged, that is what makes it so fun.  Just let him get it out of his system and then he will move on like my son has.  After all once you win first place every time it becomes a little boring.  Oh-yeah, look out there is also a Lego Racer ll.<br/>\n<br/>\nNic  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Dawn Falbe <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Alwayslearning@yahoogroups.com\">Alwayslearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, January 11, 2002 2:48 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Need Feeback on a Computer Issue<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi All:<br/>\n<br/>\n  Decided it was time to ask the group about an issue I&#39;m having with Zak (6)<br/>\n  and the computer.  He has tons of cd&#39;s, reading, history, languages,<br/>\n  puzzles, math etc and we recently bought his a &quot;Lego Racers&quot; game.  Now he&#39;s<br/>\n  always played these other games in moderation.  He&#39;ll play for 1 hour<br/>\n  sometimes less and then move onto something else... So this is the issue...<br/>\n  as we are working on being as radical unschoolers as possible he has<br/>\n  unlimited time to do anything.  Today he spent 5 hours playing Lego<br/>\n  Racers!!!!... I finally asked him to come to the kitchen at 3pm for some<br/>\n  pizza with the rest of the family.  He has now gone outside to play with Max<br/>\n  (2.5) and DH, who worked from home today....<br/>\n<br/>\n  So....the question....  Should I monitor how much time he spends playing the<br/>\n  Lego Racers program, when I don&#39;t monitor how much time he does anything<br/>\n  else?  Should I just let him spend all day and night on the computer if he<br/>\n  wants and see what happens?
