We have a pretty large <br/>\nnetwork of unschooled teens - especially in the older teens age range. And I <br/>\nsee a LOT of them struggling with a lot or a bit of anxiety and some with <br/>\ndepression.  I&#39;ve also watched a number of them sort of coming to terms with <br/>\nreally making decisions about their futures - really deciding to go to <br/>\ncollege or get full-time work or whatever. And others just drift or jump &lt;G&gt; <br/>\nsmoothly into their next step, too. But I just don&#39;t think we should mislead <br/>\nanybody into thinking that unschooling is insurance against difficult <br/>\nadolescence - including anxiety or depression.<br/>\n<br/>\nON THE OTHER HAND, I can only imagine that some of these kids would have had <br/>\njust as hard a time and probably even MUCH worse, if they&#39;d been in school. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd - they are truly such special kids -- my daughter and I were talking <br/>\nabout my niece, who is really nice and a great kid who is in high school. I <br/>\nwas saying that I&#39;d been asking her about a trip she took with her school, to <br/>\nCatalina Island. Her responses were all about how &quot;they let us do this&quot; and <br/>\n&quot;they let us do that.&quot; It was disconcerting -- my conversations with <br/>\nunschooled kids do NOT include that &quot;they let us&quot; kind of stuff at all. My <br/>\nniece, as bright and sweet as she is, does not even remotely have the sense <br/>\nof self that any unschooled kid I know has. Their conversations are filled <br/>\nwith: &quot;I decided to do this&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m planning to do that.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5255,"nextTopicId":5270}}
