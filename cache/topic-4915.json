It was being put on by a group that travels around the state to<br/>\nthe different schools and produces these cute little performances.  <br/>\nThe auditions were held at the school, of course,  and when we got there<br/>\nthey wanted all the kids to sit in a circle on the floor, littlest to<br/>\nbiggest.   They had this freaky way of quieting the kids down-- the guy<br/>\nwould clap his hands  1-2---123, and the kids would get quiet and echo<br/>\nthe clapping.  Weird.  It struck me as very creepy that ALL the kids<br/>\nunderstood this is what they were supposed to do.  <br/>\nAnyway,  it was all pretty tedious for the little kids and when Dylan had<br/>\nto use the restroom he just got up and walked across the circle.  The guy<br/>\nsaid  something like, hey, you need to sit down, and Dylan told him he<br/>\nwas going to the bathroom.  The guy said  -  well, you want to raise your<br/>\nhand and ask first! -  and Dylan said,   no thanks, I just want to go the<br/>\nbathroom...  It was so sweet to me.  He had no idea other people told<br/>\nkids when they could pee.  <br/>\nHe decided not to stay for the rest of the audition and we went to the<br/>\npark instead.  That was much more fun anyway.  We did see the production<br/>\nand it was good, but I felt sorry for all those kids who had to raise<br/>\nthier hand to go potty.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4914,"nextTopicId":4817}}
