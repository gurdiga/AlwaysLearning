I brought some  more over here:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-We&#39;re talking about 33 million Americans who are fluent in  <br/>\ntexting, e-mailing, blogging, IM&#39;ing and constantly amending their  <br/>\nprofiles on social network sites -- which, on average, 30 of their  <br/>\nfriends will visit every day, hanging out and writing for 20 minutes  <br/>\nor so each. They&#39;re connected, they&#39;re collaborative, they&#39;re used to  <br/>\nwriting about themselves. In fact, they choose to write about  <br/>\nthemselves, on their own time, rather than its being a forced labor  <br/>\nwhen a paper&#39;s due in school. Regularly, often late at night, they&#39;re  <br/>\ngenerating a body of intimate written work. They appreciate the value  <br/>\nof a good story and the power of a speech that moves: Ninety-seven  <br/>\npercent of the teenagers in the Common Core survey connected &quot;I have  <br/>\na dream&quot; with its speaker -- they can watch Dr. King deliver it on  <br/>\ndemand -- and eight in 10 knew what &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is about.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-This is, of course, the kind of knowledge we should be  <br/>\nencouraging. The Internet has turned teenagers into honest  <br/>\ndocumentarians of their own lives -- reporters embedded in their  <br/>\nhomes, their schools, their own heads.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are all on MySpace and are whizzes with YouTube.  Holly and  <br/>\nMarty are great with Photoshop and digital cameras.  (Kirby&#39;s too  <br/>\nold, maybe. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it would be wonderful for them to do a comparison of kids who  <br/>\nhave internet access and those who are forbidden to use the internet  <br/>\nand see who&#39;s doing better.  But it might just show a genetic  <br/>\nslowness in those whose parents want to keep their kids in 1962.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny C","from":"&quot;Jenny C&quot; &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Internet, computers and kids","postDate":"1205875640","msgId":33208,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZycGMzbytlMzZiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":33213,"prevInTime":33207,"nextInTime":33209,"topicId":33208,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Here s an article that someone posted on a local list.
