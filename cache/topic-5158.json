I have been homeschooling for 10 years. We have lots of curriculum around here but never really got into it. The kids just don&#39;t like canned curriculum.. then came the realization that I have incredibly creative children. Sitting down to schoolwork was just defeating the purpose and squelching their creativity. My daughter taught herself (with little help from dad who is an amazing guitarist) how to play guitar over 6 months. She was online looking up guitar chords and practicing and practicing. then she got to the point where she could dissect a song and learn how to play it even if she couldn&#39;t find the chords online.. <br/>\nWe had a very crazy year last year.. in light of all this the kids wanted something more structured, I bartered for SOS computer curriculum.. They enjoyed it for a season but after that they done.. It became a struggle. That is where we are now. <br/>\nMy dh broke his ankle 3 weeks ago and has been home. It has been stressful- the house is a mess, I am pulling my hair out. So it was time for this mommy to help the children get refocused on what they wanted to do. <br/>\nAs far as the computer games- we were just interested in the type of thinking involved. I didn&#39;t want a list that proved that this video game covered this subject.. My 13 yr old is finding this all so interesting. My dh and I are as well. <br/>\nIt has been a great while since the kids have sat down to &quot;do&quot; math. It has always been my position that they would learn what they need to when they need to. And I see math being done in real life daily. Sometimes my dh needs more- so I pass on information to him. <br/>\nI love to learn that is why I joined the list. I had never realized how much thinking skills went into video games. Of course I was a kid when pac man, frogger and donkey kong were the fore front of video games- remember intelevision?<br/>\nThank you again for your patience with me,<br/>\ndebra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"ENSEMBLE S-WAYNFORTH","from":"ENSEMBLE S-WAYNFORTH &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"4"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] new here","postDate":"1203115044","msgId":32069,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI1OTc5OC4zNTYwLnFtQHdlYjg2MjEwLm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":32068,"nextInTopic":32070,"prevInTime":32068,"nextInTime":32070,"topicId":5158,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Maybe it is the sitting next to your brother watching in awe as he rescues Princess Peach with such finesse that will help to make you a stronger person, a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1622427632\">Maybe it<br/>\nis the sitting next to your brother watching in awe as he rescues Princess Peach with such finesse that will help to make you a stronger person, a more grounded person who knows that his family is there for him and because of that you won&#39;t have any problem reaching for the stars. <br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry I got my pronouns confused.

Paper","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1178243197\">Super Mario Galaxy has cool gravitational force stuff going on. Really cool stuff. I get lost sometimes in the beauty of the game and forget to play. Paper Mario is all about working in two dimensions and three dimensions. Again a stunning demonstration of something bland and dull sounding on paper. It is all logic and puzzle solving. But it isn&#39;t separate from story telling or geography or art. Just like most things exist in an overlap with other subjects if you are looking to make a list of how they fit one school curriculum or another. But Mario is about having a good time and playing on a video game. It may become a reference point for something else. Talking about orbits and gravity and all of those things might lead to or from Super Mario Galaxy or not. Maybe those experiences will just be about the pleasure of the game. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was playing World of Warcraft today with Simon and Linnaea. Simon wanted to take my new character somewhere and I just followed him. He new how to get from the land we were in through 2 other lands so quickly. It was wonderful to follow where he led. His navigational skills in the game are fantastic. I don&#39;t know if that will predispose him to orienteering or being able to find his way around London or somewhere else, but it was awesome to sit at my computer while he sat at his and just see him negotiate within this massive world. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you are still standing on the precipice contemplating unschooling. It sounds like unschooling is this scary chaos in front of you and you can&#39;t quite see how it works, but you want to, but you also want to know that your children will still be well-versed in the basics. There aren&#39;t subjects in real life. Life isn&#39;t divided up into English and Geometry and Calculus and European History and U.S. History and Social Studies. They all blend. History is rife in English and Geometry, and vice versa. One thing leads to another not in linear fashion but in a more immersive one. Say you get fascinated by knitting, I have this brilliant book on how to knit a traditional fisherman sweater. It has pictures of poor waifs with sharpened pieces of wire knitting Ganseys for a living or for relatives. The waifs lived not far from where I live now, but I got the book in Albuquerque. There is a moment of history. There is information about animal husbandry,<br/>\n or about which breed of sheep or goat you use to get your wool from, if you want it. There is counting and designing and adjusting. There is the smell of the lanolin, the feel of raw wool, finding bits of it when you walk out near a field where sheep are kept and taking it home to see if you can spin it. There is the moments when you sit with others knitting in a circle chatting about something else while trying not to drop a stitch. And I don&#39;t know which of any of those moments, of those reference will be valuable, will make a knitter a better employee, a better adult. Maybe none of them will. But they all are learning moments, they are all part of the context of knitting. It is the same with video games. Maybe it is the emotional skills of dealing with frustration and coming up with techniques so that you can walk away when it is too much and come back when you are ready.
