Rowling, referencing Harry Potter:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;He is also a billion-dollar media property and a global cultural  <br/>\nfigure. Now translated into 65 languages, the books have joined a  <br/>\ncanon that stretches from Cinderella to Star Wars, giving people a  <br/>\nway to discuss culture and commerce, politics and values. Princeton  <br/>\nEnglish professor William Gleason compares the series&#39; impact to the  <br/>\nfrenzy that surrounded Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin before the Civil War. &#39;That  <br/>\nbook penetrated all levels of society,&#39; he says. &#39;It&#39;s remarkable how  <br/>\nsimilar the two moments are.&#39; And he does not see this as a passing  <br/>\nfad or some triumph of clever marketing. &#39;They&#39;ve spoken profoundly  <br/>\nto enough readers that they will be read and reread by children and  <br/>\nby adults for a long time,&#39; he says. Feminist scholars write papers  <br/>\non Hermione&#39;s road to self-determination. Law professors cite Dobby&#39;s  <br/>\ntale to teach contract law and civil rights. University of Tennessee  <br/>\nlaw professor Benjamin Barton published &#39;Harry Potter and the Half- <br/>\nCrazed Bureaucracy,&#39; in the Michigan Law Review, which examined  <br/>\nRowling&#39;s view of the legitimacy of government. His conclusion?  <br/>\n&#39;Rowling may do more for libertarianism than anyone since John Stuart  <br/>\nMill.&#39; A Rutgers researcher named a rare rain-forest plant in Ecuador  <br/>\napparata after her verb apparate because it seemed to appear out of  <br/>\nnowhere. French intellectuals debate whether the stories indoctrinate  <br/>\nkids into free-market capitalism. In Turkey, the books were absorbed  <br/>\ninto the argument over Turkey&#39;s cultural geography: Is Harry a symbol  <br/>\nof Western imperialism or of lost Eastern traditions of mysticism and  <br/>\nalchemy? A seventh-grade teacher in Pakistan in November invited her  <br/>\nclass to compare the country&#39;s crisis to Harry Potter. The class  <br/>\nimmediately cast Pervez Musharraf as Voldemort and Benazir Bhutto as  <br/>\nBellatrix. &#39;Potter is like a Rorschach blot,&#39; says Georgetown  <br/>\ngovernment professor Daniel Nexon, &#39;for people articulating concerns  <br/>\nabout globalization in their cultural setting. It&#39;s incredibly  <br/>\nsignificant that Potter even enters these debates.&#39; &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/personoftheyear/article/\">http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/personoftheyear/article/</a> <br/>\n0,28804,1690753_1695388_1695436,00.html<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/2z87hp\">http://tinyurl.com/2z87hp</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea of connections isn&#39;t off topic, but the many connections to  <br/>\nany specific thing goes off topic pretty quickly, so I&#39;m reminded to  <br/>\nlink a blog I&#39;ve started just for the purpose of helping people  <br/>\nexplore connections for fun.
