Not from what I&#39;ve<br/>\nread.  Victorino was a career criminal and to have a career in most things<br/>\nyou have to work at it.  That&#39;s what this guy did.  Worked at being a<br/>\ncriminal.  I think I would know if my sons were being criminals.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso those who flew into the twin towers and the pentagon were religious<br/>\nzealots who absolutely believed they were dying for their religion.  I<br/>\nremember when I emigrated to the US in 1982 and my step-father (who was in<br/>\nthe military at the time) was going on and on about the Russians and the<br/>\nproblems they posed (turns out he was wrong about that - amongst other<br/>\nthings he&#39;s wrong about).  My mother and I, coming from England, and being<br/>\nused to hearing international news that doesn&#39;t have a US slant on it, knew<br/>\nsomething like this would happen.  I remember saying to him &quot;you need to be<br/>\nworried about the religious zealots in the middle east because they will die<br/>\nfor their religion unlike most Americans&quot;.. Of course he said I was wrong<br/>\nabout that.. Seems I wasn&#39;t..<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNamaste<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you need a particular example, The Deltona Murders was over an Xbox, and<br/>\nthe deaths contributed to a style of killing from one of the games.<br/>\nWas it a games influence? Probably not as most people wouldn&#39;t emulate video<br/>\nmurder in real life.<br/>\nWhy did it happen? The debates could last forever (and have)<br/>\n9/11 terrorists were said to train on a flight simulator that had the exact<br/>\npattern they flew.<br/>\nIn the game, you are to fly between the towers but as it&#39;s a game, you can<br/>\nfly into the towers.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom The Daytona Beach News Journey<br/>\n<br/>\nVictorino was a career criminal. So much of his adult life was spent in<br/>\ntrouble, in a courtroom and then behind bars. When someone crossed him,<br/>\nVictorino responded with violence. In 1996, he beat a man so severely that<br/>\ndoctors needed more than a dozen titanium plates to rebuild the victim&#39;s<br/>\nface. The victim believes Victorino shoved a walking cane down his throat. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the killings of these six people, &quot;motive&quot; has been hard to pin down. <br/>\n<br/>\nInvestigators say trouble began the day Belanger found Victorino squatting<br/>\nin her grandmother&#39;s unoccupied home, across town. She removed his things --<br/>\nsome clothes, CDs, a video game system -- and Victorino wanted it all back. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut a friend would later say he wanted his cocaine back. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd others close to him would offer a deeper motive, one that cuts to the<br/>\ncore of what ignites a killer&#39;s rage: It was all about disrespect.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27269,"nextTopicId":27275}}
