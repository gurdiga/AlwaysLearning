So the other day we were trading in our<br/>\nvan for a spiffy new truck and the finance guy was<br/>\nreally fun.

Then he made a crack about calling my husband<br/>\nDavid, and that I must have been a big X-Files fan and<br/>\nthat was why I married him.  I was really surprised<br/>\nbecause of the beard and glasses.
