Radical unschooling (or freedom in your analogy) works because there is a partnership between parent and child. If you, as the hostess, provide a visiting child with choices that they know their parents won&#39;t approve of, then there is more disharmony between that child with their parent. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey will feel guilty at the same time that they may lunge for the candy bar.

If it helps, the responses of the parents of these kids have largely fallen into one of two categories: 1) many are so NOT tuned into their kids, so NOT conscious that they have no idea what their kids are up to...so the bliss of their kids in my home is a secret pleasure that their children benefit from...and 2) those that DO notice the &quot;unusual&quot; freedoms their kids are experiencing have, for the most part, accepted the difference as an occasional abberation from their childrens&#39; typical life experience...in which case, I get to sigh with happiness that their kids get to feel, just for a moment, what it feels to be free:)<br/>\n<br/>\nKirsten<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Genevieve Raymond &lt;genevieve.raymond@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been lurking for awhile, and am ready with my first question!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We&#39;ve been largely unschooling our 6-year old twins, but only recently<br/>\n&gt; really falling (in a really wonderful way) into radical unschooling.  In the<br/>\n&gt; past I shared the same restrictions with my parent friends (my kids&#39;<br/>\n&gt; friends&#39; parents) with regard to food and video games (never very strict,<br/>\n&gt; but definitely limited).  Now that we&#39;ve let go of these limits, it&#39;s made<br/>\n&gt; for some interesting dynamics when we have friends over.  As you can<br/>\n&gt; imagine, some of the kids are pretty into the video games when they come<br/>\n&gt; over, and seem pretty fascinated by the fact that my kids will just offer<br/>\n&gt; them sweets (without asking or having to sneak!)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One concern I have is that some parents who are largely abolitionists when<br/>\n&gt; it comes to digital media will be uncomfortable with their kids playing over<br/>\n&gt; here, even though everyone has a good time (and the parents are very good<br/>\n&gt; friends of ours.)  I don&#39;t want my kids to lose time with friends because<br/>\n&gt; their friends&#39; parents are parenting differently.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Another concern is whether I should be the respecting rules, restrictions,<br/>\n&gt; whatever that my friends have set up for their kids.  I have to admit that I<br/>\n&gt; experience quite a bit of delight getting to say to these children, &quot;Of<br/>\n&gt; course you can go play a video game!&quot;  or &quot;Of course you can have that<br/>\n&gt; cookie!&quot; (and seeing the delight in their eyes).  But I guess I have a bit<br/>\n&gt; of a fear that I&#39;m going to mess up some dynamic in their household or even<br/>\n&gt; more, make the parents resentful of me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One last concern--yesterday, for the first time after a play date with a<br/>\n&gt; friend, my kids expressed the worry that a certain friend only wanted to<br/>\n&gt; play with them for their video games.  Oi, how to handle that one?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My close friends know about this journey we&#39;re on, but as you know, if<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re not fully engaged in radical unschooling, the beautiful logic behind<br/>\n&gt; it just isn&#39;t that apparent.  I think to some of them, they think that we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; lifting restrictions so that our kids will no longer obsess over<br/>\n&gt; games/sweets because games/sweets are inherently bad.  Like it&#39;s a tactic to<br/>\n&gt; get them to stop these troublesome behaviors rather than an attempt to<br/>\n&gt; provide a variety of choices to my kids and accept the choices that they<br/>\n&gt; make without judgement.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m curious how you all have handled differences in parenting styles with<br/>\n&gt; both your children&#39;s friends and their parents.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Genevieve<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":472480490,"authorName":"sheeboo2","from":"&quot;sheeboo2&quot; &lt;brmino@...&gt;","profile":"sheeboo2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Friends, friends&#39; parents, and their rules and restrictions","postDate":"1313251286","msgId":62349,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGoyNjc0bStwdm5xQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PENBS0xzV1k2aU5rRzBiMzRDbXBxejNQQkM2eXhBck12PVlEVnVjWFVnVDZ3aG8tTnlvQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":62342,"nextInTopic":62356,"prevInTime":62348,"nextInTime":62350,"topicId":62332,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We ve dealt with these issues as well, especially with a close friend for whom TV/computers and food are controlled.

Noor asked for this rule, and it is much kinder for her to have us be the bad guys, so she isn&#39;t constantly in the position of having to say she doesn&#39;t want to do that (TV/computer) now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked many of the same questions you did some time back.

Offer those other things right away so that the kids aren&#39;t defaulting to video games. That way your friends aren&#39;t set up to be uncomfortable and the kids still have fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also have specific video-game gatherings or movie marathons. That lets parents make up their mind each time. Even parents who are strict about movies or games will sometimes agree to a specific event or party. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you can also ask if the parents would rather play dates be at their house - ask up front rather than setting all the kids up for disappointment over &quot;maybe they can come play&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; One last concern--yesterday, for the first time after a play date with a<br/>\n&gt; friend, my kids expressed the worry that a certain friend only wanted to<br/>\n&gt; play with them for their video games.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, that can be frustrating! Again, have other things planned and offer those first. Depending on the situation, it may be easier to put all the controllers away when certain kids visit. That&#39;s something we did with one of Mo&#39;s friends for awhile, because he&#39;d go right to the playstation and put in a game and then be very unpleasant if Mo wanted to do something else or play a different game - and he didn&#39;t always choose 2-player games. So I suggested to Mo that we try putting the controllers up and we did that a few times... maybe three times before she wanted to try leaving them out and redirecting him in other ways. Now she gets him out on the trampoline first thing and when they&#39;re done with that George invites him into the kitchen to make cookies - he looooooves to get his hands all gooey, and loves George&#39;s cookies so that works well (and Mo doesn&#39;t like goo on her hands so its kind of a thrill for George to get to play in the kitchen with this little guy). Once our little friend has blown off some steam and had a snack, he&#39;s much more easy-going about playing a video game. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Friends, friends&#39; parents, and their rules and restrictions","postDate":"1313239969","msgId":62337,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY3MzRBQzhGLTQ1MDMtNDJEQi1BM0U0LUM1NTJEOTlFNUFDN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBS0xzV1k2aU5rRzBiMzRDbXBxejNQQkM2eXhBck12PVlEVnVjWFVnVDZ3aG8tTnlvQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBS0xzV1k2aU5rRzBiMzRDbXBxejNQQkM2eXhBck12PVlEVnVjWFVnVDZ3aG8tTnlvQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":62333,"nextInTopic":62342,"prevInTime":62336,"nextInTime":62338,"topicId":62332,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-One concern I have is that some parents who are largely abolitionists when it comes to digital media will be uncomfortable with their kids playing over ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-589042147\">-=-One concern I have is that some parents who are largely abolitionists when<br/>\nit comes to digital media will be uncomfortable with their kids playing over<br/>\nhere, even though everyone has a good time (and the parents are very good<br/>\nfriends of ours.)

We would always discuss, before other kids came over, what strategy my kids would like to take as to what activities and foods were offered.  The factors were what their parents allowed at home, how those kids were with different things, generosity on our part, avoidance on our part (as seemed tactful and beneficial for the group as a whole).  So we didn&#39;t discuss it with those terms, but one kid loved ice cream at our house.  One wanted to do art stuff.  One wanted to ride bikes or roller blade.  One liked to dress up and do plays, so we would get the costume box out and he would always want to be the princess.  (Seriously; we accommodated a cross-dressing six/seven year old whose mother would have freaked out.)  One family of four kids  couldn&#39;t get through the living room if the TV was on, so we&#39;d have it off when they got there, and they were scatter to the yard, the kids&#39; room, the kitchen easily.  Maybe later one of my kids would turn a video on, depending on how things went and how long they were going to be there.<br/>\n<br/>\nEngage your kids in the issues and possible options.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-One last concern--yesterday, for the first time after a play date with a<br/>\nfriend, my kids expressed the worry that a certain friend only wanted to<br/>\nplay with them for their video games.

IF the games are fun, or more fun, with that kid, then it&#39;s a good deal! If the games are not as fun with that kid, then eh.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThere were times we had another kid over and just let him play games by himself.    It was like a charity situation, where a kid without games at home used ours sometimes.
