If you can change routines so that the situations that bother your partner happen at other times. For instance if the partner doesn&#39;t like TV, arrange for the kids to watch TV at other times and have them do other activities in the evening. (You can explain that to the kids as a kind favor to the partner.) ---<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you, for all the helpful responses!  This reminder from Joyce (though in response to someone else) to help reduce conflict for my spouse really is relevant to me right now.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday, there was a thunderstorm as my family was getting ready to drive in horrible traffic to a free dress rehearsal of a professional modern ballet.  My husband didn&#39;t really want to go and also felt it was unsafe to drive so far in the weather we were having.  Considering him, and his concerns, I waited until the thunderstorm let up to a light rain and suggested that he stay home and do other things he had been putting off and I&#39;d take the girls with me to the ballet.  I spent all day out into the evening and my husband had a full day at home tackling his list of things he&#39;d been wanting to do (including putting my office furniture together).  When I got home with our girls, though my husband was eager to get them to bed &quot;at a reasonable time&quot;, the girls were so inspired by the performance they saw, they performed for over an hour their own modern ballet for hubby and me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it planted a seed with my girls to mention a couple times in a brief, nonchalant way this past week that Papa had concerns about their iPhone use at bedtime and that I wanted us to figure something out with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband may not be a radical unschooler, but he&#39;s academically an unschooler.  Spontaneously, or perhaps, unconsciously, little things came together last night that opened up radical unschooling in a gentle way to my family.  My husband was delighted to watch them dance, though it was &quot;past their bedtime&quot; and he didn&#39;t complain or argue about bedtimes or iPhones though they switched to their iPhones after their performance was done.  I got a completed set of office furniture including a file cabinet that had been unassembled for several years now!  Everyone went to bed content peacefully.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is also a helpful reminder to me from Meredith:<br/>\n<br/>\n((( Loving up your partner and letting him know he&#39;s valued and appreciated is another part of it, as is understanding that he&#39;s going to be learning in his own way - and if you try to teach him, you may well undermine his process. )))<br/>\n<br/>\nI am seeing what my process has been moving towards Unschooling and I&#39;m being impatient with my husband.  I want him to be where I am with things.  He&#39;s onboard with Unschooling, but not the radical part.  As I appreciate him where he&#39;s at, as I appreciate my girls with where they&#39;re at, everyone is more peaceful and more joyful.  There&#39;s less stress with acceptance and the opportunity to learn and grow is better in a peaceful, joyful and unstressed environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you, everyone for your thoughtful responses!  I&#39;m still reading and thinking on them.  So much to chew on!

I wonder if your husband is seeing the kids slipping away into an independence that renders him less important in their lives. Maybe he is missing reading to them or connecting with them in some other way.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe might relax more about the electronics and about bed time if his needs for connection with his kids and wife were being met. Possibly he would see the value of the kids being on their electronics for a little while in the evening, if it freed up that time for some canoodling with his wife. Maybe he would like to spend more time playing with the kids earlier in the evening? (Sometimes that is not the case if he&#39;s tired after working.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne useful thing might be to ask the kids to show him all about the games that they like and how they work. There&#39;s nothing like hearing a kid explain all about their games to dispel many fears, including that playing makes them isolated and uncommunicative.<br/>\n<br/>\nDads who spend time away all day at work often feel left out of the wonderful fun going on without them at home. Sometimes they react with a desire to control. Sometimes all it takes is listening to their ideas, and stroking their arms, and kissing their cheek, and realizing that it is just the desire to express their feelings coming out sounding like directives - and that there really isn&#39;t a concrete plan to take action and it was just venting about some underlying fears.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Our boys are 1, 4, 6 and 8.5.  As one example, I nurse the baby to sleep or wear in in a wrap and walk around the house/outside.  If I am doing something with my older boys, my husband will take Hugo (1) to a quiet dark room and hang out with him, playing a little bit and then he will just hold him a comfy chair and watch TV together until he dozes off.   So I think that each parent might have his/her own methods to accomplish the same thing.  If it weren&#39;t about the media, would your husband be telling you what method to use?  Or how to help your daughter sleep?  For example, if you are nursing a baby/toddler to sleep, would he come in and announce that the baby has nursed for 20 minutes so it is time to unlatch that baby?  Or that the bath is too long, or you can only read 1 book instead of 3?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am wondering if breaking it down into what &quot;works&quot; in partnering with your children to help them get to sleep rather than unlimited media vs. limited media? The what &quot;works&quot; will change over time anyway and be different for each child.   If looking at it from that angle might help him feel less defensive than making it about correct way to unschooling?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if that doesn&#39;t help then, yes, I would ask my husband to either watch and play with the younger one while I read to the older one (if that is what she wants to do) or vice versa so that you are able to help your girls to sleep peacefully.  Or ask him if he would like to take over that sleepy time ritual all together.  Otherwise he would be undermining your own worked out methods of helping your girls to sleep.  Fighting over turning off media or reading only one book or whatever is not going to help anyone relax.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKaren</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: DH wants limits now on media","postDate":"1334162520","msgId":66696,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ4NzUxOUQ0LTUwQUEtNDE2Mi1CREQ5LTIxRkM1RTdFNkIxMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGptM3V2bCtxbGsyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGptM3V2bCtxbGsyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":66692,"nextInTopic":66698,"prevInTime":66695,"nextInTime":66697,"topicId":66678,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Wow so you have yourself in a bit of a bind as far as how smooth the household runs.

Again, don&#39;t say it in a way that is about correct methodology, simply say, this is what works for me and the girls. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Because my husband says goodnight to the girls before they actually completely unwind and fall asleep, I can choose to uphold my husband&#39;s &quot;5 more minutes of your video, then it&#39;s off&quot; or I can let it go longer.  I&#39;ve been letting it go as long as it is not disturbing anyone.  I&#39;ve tried discussing with my husband the value of what they are watching and learning as well as how limiting media makes it more appealing to them.  I&#39;ve sent him Pam&#39;s article on the economics of restriction.  I&#39;ve told him about my college best friend who religiously watched TV throughout college -- she was not allowed to watch TV growing up.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My husband has strong feelings on limiting our girls&#39; media use.  I feel that if I support his stance on it, what have been peaceful bedtimes for me will become stressful arguments over turning off the iPhone that I will have to enforce because my husband does not put the girls to bed.  At the same time, when I don&#39;t enforce my husband&#39;s new rules/limits, I feel I&#39;m undermining him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":501943000,"authorName":"Sarah","from":"&quot;Sarah&quot; &lt;sunflowermorning31@...&gt;","profile":"sunflowermorning31","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: DH wants limits now on media","postDate":"1334148917","msgId":66692,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGptM3V2bCtxbGsyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEQ4OTRGMTYyLThEOTYtNEY3Mi1BQ0ExLUY3RUY2NTQ5NTZGNkB5YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":66679,"nextInTopic":66696,"prevInTime":66691,"nextInTime":66693,"topicId":66678,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Good Morning, Wow so you have yourself in a bit of a bind as far as how smooth the household runs.

I totally understand that bind because I am presently in one myself actully. Its hard when we live in households with different opinons and thoughts because we all are our own people. But what needs to be acknowledged I think here is that yes you have your ideas about the iphone, your hubby has his, but the missing link is that your children have theirs as well and their opinon is as important as yours and his. When we would run into this in our household where I have a different opinon then my husband , we asked the kids what they thought. Well actully even when we agree about things, wee ask because this is their home too but we have had many a conversation here about weither or not their playing a certain video game to much or watching to much video. I was always of the opinon tht they were not, but my husband would often say I think they are watching to much. when we asked the children and we both stated our case/thoughts , there have been times( which is happening right now) that the children would say , you know what your right dad, I am getting a little to wrapped up  , I am gonna take a break. I know that your children are young, but I believe that even young children deserve a chance to speak their mind about whats happening. Its not always easy but often they have alot of very valuable things to say. I would seriously call a family meeting and let your husband say to your chidlren , this is how I am feeling, I think its to much or whatever. without threatening to take it away, thats the important part. You have to remeber that these little humans deserve to have a say in their life. Then have your hubby ask why itsimportant to them? what their thoughts are on it , and go from there. Now I dont claim to have this all figured out, I most definitly do not lol, but this is what has worked in our family. <br/>\nBrightest blessings and the best of luck<br/>\nSarah<br/>\nUnschooling mama of five.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":138778570,"authorName":"catfish_friend","from":"catfish_friend &lt;catfish_friend@...&gt;","profile":"catfish_friend","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"DH wants limits now on media","postDate":"1334136730","msgId":66678,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQ4OTRGMTYyLThEOTYtNEY3Mi1BQ0ExLUY3RUY2NTQ5NTZGNkB5YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":66679,"prevInTime":66677,"nextInTime":66679,"topicId":66678,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My husband has been saying recently that he is concerned with the amount of TV and iPhone usage our 3 and 5.75 year old girls are having.  He has said that he","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-884954873\">My husband has been saying recently that he is concerned with the amount of TV and iPhone usage our 3 and 5.75 year old girls are having.  He has said that he had been &quot;letting things go&quot; as a way of being sensitive to my needs and wants in how I want to parent as well as because I had an unexpected job loss and my grandmother had passed away.  He didn&#39;t want to add to my stress by pressing the issue before.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe and I see some things the same way and some quite differently with regard to their media use.<br/>\n<br/>\nBedtimes used to be reading time but once the iPhones came along, reading books wasn&#39;t as appealing.  One or the other may still ask to read, but often they want different books so the iPhone has been great.  One watches her show  or plays a game while I read with the other.  My husband rarely puts them to bed.  Both girls voluntarily and gladly turn their iPhones off when they are done with them and ready to sleep (or read).  I have told this to my husband, but he feels they are up too late because they are overstimulated from watching videos right before bed.  I don&#39;t see it that way at all.  What is ironic to me about this is that he often falls asleep in front of the TV himself.  I mentioned this to him, but he comes back with, &quot;I&#39;m 40, not 5.&quot;  We&#39;ve had talks about TV limits growing up.  I had none and he had limits.  I work in film editing but hardly watch TV (except what I watch with the girls).  I think rarely a night goes by that my husband doesn&#39;t watch TV...<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause my husband says goodnight to the girls before they actually completely unwind and fall asleep, I can choose to uphold my husband&#39;s &quot;5 more minutes of your video, then it&#39;s off&quot; or I can let it go longer.  I&#39;ve been letting it go as long as it is not disturbing anyone.  I&#39;ve tried discussing with my husband the value of what they are watching and learning as well as how limiting media makes it more appealing to them.  I&#39;ve sent him Pam&#39;s article on the economics of restriction.  I&#39;ve told him about my college best friend who religiously watched TV throughout college -- she was not allowed to watch TV growing up.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband has strong feelings on limiting our girls&#39; media use.  I feel that if I support his stance on it, what have been peaceful bedtimes for me will become stressful arguments over turning off the iPhone that I will have to enforce because my husband does not put the girls to bed.  At the same time, when I don&#39;t enforce my husband&#39;s new rules/limits, I feel I&#39;m undermining him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI actively see the benefits my girls get from watching their shows as well as the games they play on their iPhones.  I don&#39;t think my husband sees that and I don&#39;t know how to help him see it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could really use some suggestions on how to respond to this situation.  We are not arguing about it, but we are of two minds.  And I don&#39;t feel confident in my choices as I see them currently.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance!<br/>\n<br/>\nCeci<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iDon&#39;tAlwaysHaveItOnPhone</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66788,"nextTopicId":66790}}
