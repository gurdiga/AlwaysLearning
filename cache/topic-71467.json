I am also very empathetic towards others. My first memory of crying and being very sad in this way was watching E.T. as a six year old. It hasn&#39;t changed as an adult but I have learned how to deal with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe worst thing that happened for me was that my family didn&#39;t know how to handle it and would either laugh at me or tell me that it wasn&#39;t real and expect me to get over it. For me, while movies and books etc might be made up stories they reflect real situations and I become immersed in the story and characters. I feel the situation as if it was real even when intellectually I know it&#39;s not. As an adult I have learned to choose when I want to have this experience. I have stopped reading and watching the news too often, don&#39;t watch violent films and only watch sad films when I know I&#39;m up for it. I also wouldn&#39;t watch a sad film around people who weren&#39;t going to be okay with my crying.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of people have give advice here about not dramatising the situation further. That makes a lot of sense to me. I think what would have helped me as a child was for someone to recognise that I was upset and let me know (through words and actions) that it was okay (rather than shaming me) and let me have a cry but not make a big deal out of it. When this situation arises for me now I usually need some quiet time to reflect, feel sad for a while, maybe talk about it a little then recover. Sometimes it doesn&#39;t take long but sometimes it can affect me for a while. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe a quiet hug while she has a cry would be enough. You could give her the  space to express any feelings and thoughts that she was having but simply listen so that you weren&#39;t overdramatising anything or adding to her distress. You would be recognising she was sad and letting her know you were there to comfort her. Hugs and listening, while simple, can have profound effects.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnn-Marie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Rach &lt;rachk2000@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My daughter is like this too with animals real, on screen and with her soft toys.

Talk a little about how you&#39;ve handled them - good and bad, not in a teachy way, but the way you&#39;d share experiences with a friend. If she has friends who think she&#39;s odd and over-reactive, you could talk about how you&#39;ve shut down sometimes in order to be around other people, what&#39;s good and bad about that.
