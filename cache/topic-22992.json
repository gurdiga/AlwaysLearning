Richard (9, almost 10) and I watched Jaws today (he is on a shark kick right now).  We talked a little about the rating, it is rated PG.  I told him that I thought that if the movie had been made today it wouldn&#39;t be rated PG, but at least PG-13,  because of the gore.  There is not a lot of it, but what is there is pretty bloody, more than I remembered.  I remember thinking that it was really cheesy when I watched it originally, but I didn&#39;t think that at all this time.  He said that with the severed limbs that they show and the dead body that comes out of the hole in the boat he didn&#39;t think it would be rated PG, and we talked about how PG stands for Parental Guidance, and that the idea is that people should know their kids and be able to help guide them about whether a movie would be disturbing to them, and that different people find different things disturbing.  Both he and I were more disturbed by the disappearance of the dog in the movie than by the people getting eaten.  I am glad that they didn&#39;t show the dog being eaten.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRichard had watched all of the Shark Week shows on Discovery, and the Mythbusters episode about Jaws, and was pretty well prepared for the movie.  Before the movie he decided that he would probably want to sit on my lap while we watched, so we turned out the lights, cuddled up with a blanket and watched it.   I was there for him to cuddle into when he was scared and he even put the blanket over his head for one scene.   It was really nice and sweet.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaty J.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22990,"nextTopicId":22995}}
