Oh  <br/>\n- and LAN parties where big groups play video games for hours and  <br/>\nhours. My 18 yo went to a dance club last weekend and then spent the  <br/>\nnight at a friends&#39; house. Rosie (15) does karate a lot - two nights  <br/>\na week she&#39;s at karate until about 9 pm and there are extra nights of  <br/>\nkarate at least a few nights per month. And she has soccer practice  <br/>\ntwo evenings a week. Roxana is almost always in a show - so she has  <br/>\nrehearsals almost every night until 10 or 11 pm and then castmembers  <br/>\nwill go get something to eat after that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we&#39;re all home together, everybody is really pleased that it  <br/>\nhappened and we usually watch something we&#39;ve taped, that we all like  <br/>\nto watch together - lately it is &quot;LOST.&quot; Or, we play cards or games.  <br/>\nOh, and we have extended family that lives close (my two sisters and  <br/>\ntheir families) - Roya goes to my sister&#39;s house at least once a week  <br/>\nand spends an evening hanging out with her - they watch Gilmore Girls  <br/>\nand just hang out together - sometimes have a craft project or  <br/>\nsomething to work on. Roya goes to a gym to work out with her cousin  <br/>\nsome evenings. They all go to concerts once in a while - occasionally  <br/>\na big one, but mostly little things at local colleges. And - they go  <br/>\nto shows - lots of youth or community theater productions and an  <br/>\noccasional big production (RENT is coming in July).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, we have Disneyland passes - it costs $129 per year for the  <br/>\ncheapest pass and that leaves the summer and weekends blacked out --  <br/>\nbut it still has LOTS of days and evenings that groups of teens can  <br/>\ngo there and have a blast. There were some of us who went there just  <br/>\nthis week and spent half a day. It is really nice for them to be able  <br/>\nto meet there and hang out - go on a few rides and watch a show or  <br/>\ntwo. The waiting in line time is fun for them - it is &quot;hanging out&quot;  <br/>\ntime - not so different than hanging out on a street corner just  <br/>\ntalking.

I wanted to go live in America!<br/>\n  If it were safe and H had mates to walk home with I wouldn&#39;t have a curfew. (Although most cities have them now. No unaccompanied under 15&#39;s out alone after 9pm. Horribly disrespectful in my opinion although I can see how it appeals. People don&#39;t want loud groups of teens hanging around outside their houses)<br/>\n  To be honest, the curfew thing has never come up. H doesn&#39;t go &#39;out&#39; as such. She goes to stay at poeple&#39;s houses and comes back weeks later .If she goes into town its for the shops so its during the day.<br/>\n  but, if she did ask to go wandering the streets alone at night I would have to be all heavy and say no. there&#39;s too many rapes, sexual assaults and muggings in this area. Its not safe for a young girl out alone. Its not safe for me so I don&#39;t do it. If she was bussing to a friends house very late I would go with her or pay for a taxi.<br/>\n  Its a real shame freedom is so limited now. Although having said that, I walked 3 miles through the dark late at night when I was 17. I&#39;d had an argument with my friends. they&#39;d promised to walk home with me cos I had to be back at 10 but they didn&#39;t want to leave that early (disco I think) so i hd no choice (my mum&#39;s curfew actually made me at risk!).

It can be quite intimidationg to walk past 15-30 teens, all in hoodies.<br/>\n  There&#39;s just nowhere for them to go. Pubs don;t take under-18&#39;s, youth clubs are a bit stale, hanging out at a friends house is uncool. I remember doing the same. My mum couldn&#39;t figure out what the attraction was, especially in the winter. But it was just chatting, goofing around, bit of snogging and just hanging with a group of your friends. UK teens don&#39;t have acess to a car until 18 either. I suppose some ask mum to drive them somewhere but its a bit uncool to have your mum coming to pick you up!<br/>\n  What do American teens do?

I&#39;m assuming &#39;time to be back home when out&#39;?<br/>\n  H is 14. When she goes to visit friends she tends to stay over as they are 60 or so miles away and the last train back is at 8pm. It arrives back after the last bus so its not practical.<br/>\n  If she&#39;s going into town I ask her to be back by 6&#39;ish. Bristol is a high crime city. Lots of gangs, stabbings, daylight muggings as well as the drunken chavs on a friday and saturday night in the town centre. The bus comes up through Stapleton Road and Fishponds, reputedly the mostdangerous road in the UK so I&#39;d rather she wasn&#39;t on the bus late at night.<br/>\n  She&#39;s been ok with this but of course assumes she is immortal and thinks a white teenager down there where its all black or Asian wouldn&#39;t attract any attention.<br/>\n  At HE camps she sticks her tent y the other teens so I have no idea what time she gets back. The camp site is enormous but I tell her if they all go to the beach to make sure she&#39;s with people, not wondering country lanes alone trying to findthe campsite at 2am!<br/>\n  Its not been an issue with the boys as B hates going outside and R prefers to hang out here too. I was sort of hoping they would go out. It can&#39;t be normal for a 13 yo and  11 yo to never go out! At their age I&#39;d be out all day climbing trees and hanging around. I sometiems joke that they should be out getting into trouble like normal people!<br/>\n  When we were in VA things were easier cos there weere no buses and the kids couldn&#39;t go aywhere ;-)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  S<br/>\n<br/>\nbridgetvic1964 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:razemfamily@...\">razemfamily@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  My friend and I were talking about curfews the other night.We both <br/>\nhave grown children,and we both have young children.I remember with my <br/>\nson Nick,almost 22yrs,that it was a struggle for us,probably more for <br/>\nme,since I often let my fears get ahead of me,and I was pretty strict <br/>\nabout his curfew.I grew up in the country  so things were alot more <br/>\nrelaxed(I do not even remember having a bedtime),but living in the <br/>\ncity has so many more challenges and dangers.When Nick was younger 0-<br/>\n14 we hung out with him alot did sports,camping movies etc...but there <br/>\ncomes a time when he wanted to be alone,spend time with his friends <br/>\nthat&#39;s when I set curfews.My son,Moe will be three in June and my <br/>\ndaughter Mimi is a one and a half yrs so I know this won&#39;t be an issue <br/>\nfor a while yet I feel the mindset starts now.The question is how <br/>\nshould we approach curfews?My kneejerk reaction is enroll them in Krav <br/>\nMaga and hover over them until they are 18 and then...&lt;g&gt;I do not want <br/>\ncurfews to be an issue this time around,but I do want them safe.Bridget<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  SPONSORED LINKS <br/>\n        Unschooling   Attachment parenting   John holt     Parenting magazine   Single parenting <br/>\n    <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n  YAHOO!
