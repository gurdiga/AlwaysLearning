I&#39;m...well....extravagant...when it comes<br/>\nto celebrating the birth of my boys. But that&#39;s my excuse! I AM THRILLED they were born, and they each <br/>\n*ONLY* turn four ONCE, ONLY turn nine ONCE, only turn 13 ONCE. *I* only turn 45 ONCE! &lt;G&gt; <br/>\n <br/>\nWe celebrate birthdays here. BIG. We make a big deal of celebrating that we get to have them in our lives. <br/>\nIt IS a big deal!<br/>\n <br/>\nEach boy is different though---Cameron loved big parties with lots of kids and themes. Duncan prefers a <br/>\nbigger family-only celebration---like a trip to Busch Gardens or Disney World (he LOVES theme parks!).<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s not hard (for me, anyway) to justify expense for birthdays. I&#39;m just so glad they were born---and I <br/>\ntell them that too! &lt;g&gt; But I&#39;m also glad they&#39;re still around. I would miss them so much if they weren&#39;t <br/>\nhere. We have several friends who&#39;ve lost children tragically. That just makes me want to celebrate my <br/>\ntime with them even more.<br/>\n <br/>\nBouncy houses, face paints, balloons, costumes, trips---whatever! It&#39;s ONLY once a year, and it&#39;s ONLY <br/>\nfor the first years of their lives! It should be something they remember! I&#39;m just delighted they were <br/>\nborn!<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly, party girl----who will also rent a bouncy house just because it&#39;s Tuesday! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] spending money on bday parties","postDate":"1136523892","msgId":23815,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZCNzI1NDZDLTkyMDctNDdGNy1CQkVELTk4MjNBRTlCNzlDQ0BlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQzQkRCQTY2LjkwNTA2MDdAZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDYwMTAzMDcxNDI0LjUxNTZBRTRFQGRtMjAubXRhLmV2ZXJ5b25lLm5ldD4gPDY0MEM3OTM5LTUzQjQtNDEwOC05OTg3LTVDRDlBOEY4MTdCMkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0PiA8NDNCRDJFRjMuNTA5MDdAZ21haWwuY29tPiA8QUYxQTU0QjYtRTAyMS00QTdCLTg5NDAtNzU1NTBBRERENDBDQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+IDw0M0JEQkE2Ni45MDUwNjA3QGdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":23805,"nextInTopic":23863,"prevInTime":23814,"nextInTime":23816,"topicId":23746,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I kind of tend to like secondary sources, first.

I think it is magical thinking that comes from fear - exactly  <br/>\nlike anti-tv or anti-videogame thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat the heck is wrong with enjoying STUFF?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are parents so afraid of that they act unnecessarily stingy with  <br/>\ntheir kids?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am an economist and I know a lot about the roots of the anti- <br/>\nconsumerism movement - starting with Karl Marx and Thorstein Veblen,  <br/>\netc. I understand all the arguments. I understand conspicuous  <br/>\nconsumption, for example. I understand how people come to associate  <br/>\ntheir status in life with what products they buy, what label clothing  <br/>\nthey wear, etc. I GET all that. I understand how people in the United  <br/>\nStates consume more than our fair share of the world&#39;s resources. I  <br/>\nknow all about this whole thing. I&#39;ve participated in studies of  <br/>\n&quot;simplicity/simple living.&quot; I&#39;m all in favor of less stuff in order  <br/>\nto simplify our lives and have more time for walks in the woods, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what I don&#39;t see is that parents being GENEROUS with their  <br/>\nchildren is what leads to the negative side of consumerism. It is the  <br/>\nopposite, it is parents who focus on &quot;things&quot; and care about their  <br/>\nsocial status based on &quot;things&quot; and who treat their children like  <br/>\n&quot;products&quot; who end up caught in the negatives of consumerism. For  <br/>\nthese people, they never really totally ENJOY the stuff they&#39;re  <br/>\nbuying, they buy and buy in order just to HAVE stuff to show off.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when a kid wants a wonderful exciting happy birthday party with a  <br/>\nbounce house - that kid is NOT status-seeking or engaging in  <br/>\nconspicuous consumption or excessive consumerism - he/she is simply  <br/>\nLOVING LIFE!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think parents are so afraid of messing up their kids that they hope  <br/>\nthat by withholding things (not allowing tv or videogames, not  <br/>\nletting kids have things they want) that they&#39;ll sort of earn some  <br/>\nkind of safety or security.<br/>\n<br/>\nHarry Potter&#39;s awful cousin, Dudley, counts his gifts and throws a  <br/>\ntantrum because he thinks he&#39;s been shorted one.

But that&#39;s really not the case at  <br/>\nall - it is that parents SUBSTITUTE the stuff for real relationships  <br/>\n- it is because parents, themselves, act like a person&#39;s value is  <br/>\nbased on the labels they wear and what kind of car they drive and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we want our kids to BE generous people, we ought to be generous  <br/>\nwith them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can be thoughtful consumers and still be generous - those are not  <br/>\nnecessarily contradictory.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":170260284,"authorName":"Sandrewmama","from":"Sandrewmama &lt;sandrewmama@...&gt;","profile":"sandrewmama","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] spending money on bday parties","postDate":"1136306743","msgId":23748,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ5QzkyNDc1LUU4NTktNEUyRC1BMjBDLThDQzc0MDQwQTA0N0BtY2hzaS5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYwMTAzMDcxNDI0LjUxNTZBRTRFQGRtMjAubXRhLmV2ZXJ5b25lLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDYwMTAzMDcxNDI0LjUxNTZBRTRFQGRtMjAubXRhLmV2ZXJ5b25lLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":23746,"nextInTopic":23751,"prevInTime":23747,"nextInTime":23749,"topicId":23746,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This year I broke with tradition and gave my daughter her dream party for her eighth birthday.

She&#39;d wished for a swimming party (in  <br/>\nNovember in the midwest) and a surprise party!  I made arrangements  <br/>\nto rent a poolside hotel room and planned her surprise party!  It was  <br/>\namazing to see the look on her face when she walked into the hotel  <br/>\npool with her daddy (thinking that he was meeting a client there to  <br/>\ndrop off some job) and 12 of her closest friends jumped out and  <br/>\nshouted &quot;SURPRISE!&quot;  She was stunned!  The kids swam and swam and  <br/>\nswam and ate pizza and cake and swam some more.  The hotel cut me a  <br/>\ndeal, $20 off the regular room cost because it was a Sunday night.   <br/>\nWe held the party around the pool, we had it to ourselves and I  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have to clean my house! In all, I calculated that my cost  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t any more than if I&#39;d held the party at home because I would&#39;ve  <br/>\nhad the expenses of  games and prizes and decorations and I would&#39;ve  <br/>\nfelt compelled to send the kids home with fancier goody bags.  But,  <br/>\nsince I was providing the kids with lots of free swimming time in  <br/>\nNovember, I figured a beach ball and a little bit of candy was fair  <br/>\nenough!
