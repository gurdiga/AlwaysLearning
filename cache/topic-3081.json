(This I could do without ) <br/>\nThere were days he watched TV, or played play station all day, and still<br/>\nare, but he also does everything else.  There are days he eats cake for<br/>\nbreakfast and more days when he doesn&#39;t.  He knows what he wants, same as<br/>\nI do.<br/>\nYour son will find his own balance.  Wild energy after sitting all day is<br/>\nbalance, just like activity after sleeping at night  and a walk after a<br/>\nbig dinner.   Your son is showing you he knows about balance.  TV doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmake him a wild man, it is nature says ok, you sat, now you run. <br/>\nI would urge you to LET HIM BE.  You don&#39;t know what the future has in<br/>\nstore for him.  What if he&#39;s going to be another George Lucas, would TV<br/>\nseem like a waste of time then?  If you knew he was going to be a pilot,<br/>\nwould you ever think he could read too many books about flying?  Play<br/>\nwith too many toy airplanes?<br/>\nMy son at nine is just one example of a child let alone to make his own<br/>\nchoices.  He&#39;s not a couch potato.  He&#39;s never had a cavity. He&#39;s not<br/>\noverweight.  He has an active life of play and sports and quiet times and<br/>\nTV time and he&#39;s OK. <br/>\nKids who have loving families and lots of choices will never ALWAYS<br/>\nchoose TV.<br/>\nThey might choose TV for ten days in a row or twenty, but never ALWAYS. <br/>\nAnd you wouldn&#39;t be worried if he chose to go outside and play in the<br/>\nsand box everyday for ten days running.  There is value in everything. <br/>\nYou might not see it yet but it&#39;s there and your child has found it. <br/>\nIt&#39;s filling some need of his right now and when he&#39;s finished he&#39;ll move<br/>\non to the next thing.

Shoes are <br/>\nokay, but thrift stores are full of them (and rarely have cats or <br/>\nencyclopedias).<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe it would be very difficult for a person who loves a stripped-down <br/>\nhouse without *stuff* to unschool.   Some families with kids in school just <br/>\nhave houses for sleeping between work days and school days.  They assume that <br/>\nat school kids can do art, make noise, play with clay, look at a globe, read <br/>\nbooks, have paper and pencils  And that at home those things are just clutter <br/>\nand nonsense.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think unschoolers should get to their houses anything the parents used <br/>\nto think the kids would be able to learn about at school.  I don&#39;t know what <br/>\nthat would be, depends on what the parents think!  <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly has been asking me about terrariums (terrariae sounds like something an <br/>\nelephant would say) and I&#39;ve lamely been saying people used to make them out <br/>\nof jars and big plastic bottles and not DOING it (because I don&#39;t have a <br/>\ngreen thumb and I don&#39;t want to make the Jar of Doom for her).

It bothers me, purely as a<br/>\nnoise thing. I don&#39;t like noise very much. Cacie *loves* tv. She also<br/>\nloves Smash Mouth, and will listen to both at the same time. If I&#39;m in<br/>\nthe room, that makes me totally crazy (and she will turn one off if I ask<br/>\nher to, she&#39;s nice like that).<br/>\n<br/>\nI eat tofu from the box and have avocado sandwiches for lunch most days.<br/>\nCacie doesn&#39;t like either one.

Sometimes I worry that she&#39;s too cynical,<br/>\nsince she doesn&#39;t seem to believe anything any commercial says... tv is<br/>\nfairly interactive around here. I listen to her sometimes as she watches<br/>\nthe tv, and it&#39;s, &quot;Oh, the *boy* saves them!

The<br/>\nchild doesn&#39;t develop the self regulation skills they need to feel good<br/>\nabout making their own choices. I think some of these things are<br/>\ndevelopmental issues - more control while young and isolated and less<br/>\nwhen autonomy kicks in, but no parent is able to totally isolate their<br/>\nchildren from the surrounding influences. My daily prayer isn&#39;t to god,<br/>\nit is to myself to let go and quit thinking I run things that I really<br/>\ndo not.

People who ate *only*<br/>\ntraditional foods had *zero* decay. His book is filled with amazing x-rays<br/>\nand pictures of teeth proving his point.

Discover channel shows -- sometimes TLC and Animal Planet.  <br/>\nThey could watch other shows...they used to watch a lot of Disney cartoons -- <br/>\nthat phase seems to be over. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a bowl of Dove Dark Chocolate squares available at all times, for <br/>\nanyone.  I consider it essential to sane living, personally.  Christmas candy <br/>\nis still sitting on the family room table -- I&#39;ll probably toss it today.  <br/>\nThere&#39;s ice cream in the freezer, should anyone be so inclined.  It&#39;s not a <br/>\nbig deal.  The kids have learned they feel better if they balance sugar <br/>\nintake with protein, so they generally do.  I nudged them into being aware of <br/>\ntheir reactions so they could assess them.  And they don&#39;t get cavities.  But <br/>\nI don&#39;t think that unlimited sugar necessarily prevents cavities.  I think <br/>\nthey have good teeth/bacteria resisting genes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t limit tv, or computer, or modeling clay, or reading, or Dungeons and <br/>\nDragons, or hot dogs per se -- I DO nudge my kids if I see they&#39;re starting <br/>\nto get bleary or short with themselves and each other, in that moment, so <br/>\nthey can recognize symptoms and start to handle it on their own.  Nick can <br/>\nspend all day on the computer -- he can also spend a day broken up into lots <br/>\nof different activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also nudge them in terms of specific ideas.  We talk a lot.  I lead here <br/>\nand there.  They lead here and there.  They take flute and piano lessons.  <br/>\nThe deal is that if I pay for lessons, they practice and work with their <br/>\nteachers.  They play spontaneously during the day most days -- but some days <br/>\nlife gets busy and I nudge them about practicing as per our deal.  They&#39;re <br/>\nfree to discontinue lessons at any time.  They are happy with their ability <br/>\nand progress -- excited about playing duets together.<br/>\n<br/>\nI nudge.  I go on instinct with what my kids need from me.  There was a time, <br/>\nin our deschooling period (Nick went to private school through grade 2) -- <br/>\nwhen I didn&#39;t say word one to him about what he &quot;should&quot; do.  And he spent a <br/>\nlong time in front of the TV.  It was a year and a half before he picked up a <br/>\npencil to write or draw.  At the moment, Nick appreciates nudging with <br/>\ngeometry -- he&#39;s using the Key-to series and is feeling good about his <br/>\nprogress.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve found is that while many theories on living and raising kids have <br/>\ninteresting elements, and unschooling in particular changed important and <br/>\nbasic things for us, I know my kids better than the purveyors of any theory.  <br/>\nI learned to trust myself as a parent.  I look at how they&#39;re doing -- are <br/>\nthey happy?  Are they able to function at home and in the outside world?  Are <br/>\nthey healthy?  Are they learning about themselves and their world?  I make <br/>\nadjustments as they go through phases -- I watch, I listen, I learn.  We talk <br/>\nabout what we do and why we make the choices we do, mistakes we make, what <br/>\nseems to be working for us as individuals and as a family -- and what <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t assert there is one way which will work for all children.

Is that<br/>\nright? <br/>\n <br/>\nI know that with our lifestyle there&#39;s lots more for Isey to do than<br/>\nwatch TV. So it&#39;s not something he wants to do all the time. By having<br/>\nan enriched environment, he chooses other things. I get that. Okay now<br/>\nto other things. Brushing his teeth. He has to do it. But won&#39;t unless I<br/>\nremind him to. He&#39;d leave his toys out all over, unless I remind him to.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nIs part of the unschooling philosophy to not tell them to do anything? I<br/>\nget that message from reading some of the posts. But I also read one of<br/>\nSandra&#39;s essays about Moving Water, where she asked her son to empty the<br/>\nwater gun. So, I&#39;m not sure. <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m really curious about this. And if it is part of the philosophy not<br/>\nto tell Little Ones to brush their teeth, how do you deal with that<br/>\nDragon Breath? :)<br/>\n <br/>\nJust plain curious,<br/>\nTara<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mary Hickman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mfhick@...\">mfhick@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Sunday, January 27, 2002 11:50 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] TV, Video and unschooling<br/>\n <br/>\nEver since I joined this list I&#39;ve heard mention let the kids decide.<br/>\nNow, <br/>\nI&#39;m not sure I&#39;m a wild unschooler.

I<br/>\nout-tame-neighborhood anybody any day. &lt;g&gt; You can be a wild unschooler<br/>\nanyplace (well, okay Sandra, not in Swiss Boarding School &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\n*** I do let the kiddos decide much of their<br/>\nworld.

The TV is just laying around (well, okay, you probably keep<br/>\nit up on some kind of stand or shelf, but you get the point). Resources are<br/>\nresources are resources. TV is no less valuable than a book. A book is no<br/>\nmore valuable than a jar of peanut butter and a piece of straw. A jar of<br/>\npeanut butter and a piece of straw hold no more or less importance than a<br/>\nsunbeam and a comfy couch. Unschooling is life.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** When they watch TV they forget to play. I really turned to<br/>\nhomeschooling to allow them unlimited play time, to be themselves in their<br/>\nhome.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThemselves in their own home want to watch more TV. They won&#39;t forget to<br/>\nplay if it&#39;s important to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** So, anyone want to talk about TV and unschooling again?***<br/>\n<br/>\nI *LOVE* talking about TV and unschooling. I even talk about it to<br/>\nschool-at-homers who HATE TV and would like me to agree with them for some<br/>\nreason (well, I know the reason: the reason is that I tell people flat out<br/>\nthat my girls love TV and watch as much as they want and that tends to be a<br/>\nlot by many if not most people&#39;s standards and yet, and YET -- pay<br/>\nattention, here&#39;s the good part! -- they continue to walk upright, do not<br/>\ndrag their knuckles and don&#39;t even know how to belch yet! They are slender,<br/>\nfunny, bright, cheerful, thrifty, brave, kind, daring, and better than steak<br/>\nsauce. People HATE that about them when I&#39;m telling them that TV not only<br/>\ndidn&#39;t cause them to become sub-humanoids, it actually HELPS them because<br/>\nit&#39;s what they choose and there&#39;s much to be learned from it. But not<br/>\nnecessarily more than from a piece of straw and a jar of peanut butter. Um,<br/>\nI think this parentheses break needed it&#39;s own chapter. Sorry about that.)<br/>\n<br/>\n***My little guy never gets enough TV. He would watch every movie every day<br/>\nforever.***<br/>\n<br/>\nHe really, really, really wouldn&#39;t. Really. I can say this and I haven&#39;t<br/>\neven met the lad. At some point, he would really need to go to the bathroom.<br/>\nAnd even if he didn&#39;t, he wouldn&#39;t. Really.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** He tantrums for the TV to be on longer all the time. The more he<br/>\nwatches the more he asks the more he wants.***<br/>\n<br/>\nPut it on and let it stay on for a full year. No, two years. The reason he<br/>\ncannot limit himself is because you&#39;re limiting him. There is no way for him<br/>\nto find his natural patterns if you&#39;re there either demanding or cajoling<br/>\nhim away from the TV.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I also notice he has less ability<br/>\nto contain his wilds after watching TV. His body needs to go.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThen let it go! After he watches TV if he&#39;s full of vim and vigor (I don&#39;t<br/>\neven know what vim is, I remember the expression from somewhere and can only<br/>\nhope it isn&#39;t x-rated. Nancy, help? &lt;g&gt;) design a mad relay race around the<br/>\nhouse for everyone, including the dog, who&#39;d like to participate. Then a<br/>\nfamily jog to the local park. Then jumping jacks! You&#39;ll all be fit and trim<br/>\nand he gets to watch his TV and de-pressurize after. Everyone wins!<br/>\n<br/>\n*** I wouldn&#39;t let<br/>\nhim eat all the sugar in the house either.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI also let my daughters eat all the sugar they want. People also hate THAT,<br/>\nespecially when my ridiculous healthy daughters race around and ask me in<br/>\nthe morning (with a large bowl of candy ALWAYS available) if I would please<br/>\nmake them a bagel. Seriously, people HATE that.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** I quess I&#39;m not comfortable<br/>\nletting him choose what is right for him yet. Maybe I will grow to see he<br/>\ndoes have inner control.
