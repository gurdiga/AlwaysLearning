We had a coffee table that I made using old barn<br/>\nboards, but we moved that out of our living space for a while, in favour of<br/>\nmore floor space.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other valuable spaces in our home are shelves.  We have 11 in our<br/>\nliving space, and several in our storage spaces.  I&#39;m partial to warm<br/>\ncolours, so I have picked up lots of natural baskets over the years.  They<br/>\nsit on the open shelves.  Different things have lived in these baskets at<br/>\ndifferent times.  Some are catch-all baskets.  We have six ikea bookshelves<br/>\n(with doors) that we added to our collection of shelves over time.  I like<br/>\nthe doors because it reduces the mounting dust, and they look a bit neater.<br/>\n They were fairly reasonably priced.  Two of them have been with Doug and I<br/>\nsince well before Ethan was born, so they seem to be relatively durable too.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my own work surfaces for making things, I have used fold up tables,<br/>\ndrafting tables, easels, the floor, dining tables, work benches, outdoor<br/>\ntables, driveways, walls, etc.  I like to make things right in the middle<br/>\nof all the action most of the time.  I like to leave it for a bit, live<br/>\nwith it a while, then put stuff away and move on to another space and<br/>\nanother project.  For me, the space is part of the art.  When I recall past<br/>\nworks, I also recall the spaces I have created them in.  So, maybe,<br/>\nconsider how you daughter likes to work in your plans.  Some people like<br/>\ntheir own quiet space.  Some, like me, like to be in the center of things.<br/>\n It might change with time.

A church nursery school was closing and clearing out their furniture, and rather than throwing it away they gave it all away.  The tables can be placed next to each other in various configurations to create a larger surface, or moved apart to be used as two separate surfaces.  Since the height can be easily adjusted, my son can sit or stand by them to play or create.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At one point we also had an L-shaped IKEA desk table - it was enormous :-) and also had adjustable legs, and it easily held an entire lego village, a giant art project, etc.  It lined two whole walls of a small room, which was a lot of space for a table, but it was really nifty because it added a giant new surface to play and build on (and play under - my son loved setting up a fort underneath it!).  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Around where we live, schools, small businesses, and childcare centers often offer older classroom and office furniture they don&#39;t need any more via Craiglist at a low cost, or Freecycle at no cost.
