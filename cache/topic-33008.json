The reason I&#39;m calling his growing a <br/>\ntransition is because I see and hear the changes in him that make <br/>\nhim seem more grown up.  I know he&#39;s a whole person, always has been <br/>\nand always will be.  I also know that he&#39;s been growing since <br/>\nconception.  I used to look at him and see a little boy.  Lately, <br/>\nI&#39;m seeing more of a young man.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I realize that it might not be an option, but I would like to<br/>\n&gt; suggest that the odds are that it is an option.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, I used a poor choice of words.  Of course moving is an option <br/>\nbut my DH and I are not prepared for all that comes with selling and <br/>\nbuying houses.  We have the other children to consider, one of which <br/>\nwants to stay in this house until she graduates.  Then there are all <br/>\nthe other excuses such as updating the house, trying to sell at a <br/>\nbad time and probably not having any money left over from the <br/>\npurchase to use as a down payment on the next one.  We have talked <br/>\nabout moving in the summer of 2010 when dd15 graduates high school.  <br/>\nThis doesn&#39;t help the immediate situation though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you have more children would you move?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not until the child needed the space.  I&#39;d have the baby in with me <br/>\nIF that were even an option.  DH had a vasectomy 10 years ago and I <br/>\nhaven&#39;t yet been lucky enough for it to fail.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If that house were flooded or caught fire would you move?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes because the insurance would cover it which isn&#39;t an option in <br/>\nthe current situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If the non-option has to do with inherited family home, what about<br/>\n&gt; adding on?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Now this we have seriously considered.  We have a very large garage <br/>\nthat we thought about converting into livable space.  Jeffrey, our <br/>\nds11, said he would only use it if it was professionally finished <br/>\nwith real walls, carpet and a ceiling.  It would require taking out <br/>\na second mortgage.  We don&#39;t feel that is a sound financial decision <br/>\nright now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If your child were handicapped and you needed to change the house<br/>\n&gt; to get equipment in and out, would you?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, insurance would cover that.  And if it didn&#39;t, we&#39;d surely <br/>\ntake out a 2nd mortgage because the changes would mean something to <br/>\nthe quality of life for the disabled person.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s easy to say no.  It&#39;s easy to say &quot;can&#39;t.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes it is, and I know that all my reasons above for not being able <br/>\nto do this or that seem like easy excuses.  We don&#39;t see them as <br/>\neasy though.  Would unschooling, non-coercive parents truly make <br/>\ndecisions that put the family into major debt to give a child <br/>\neverything he desires?  Taking a 2nd mortgage to finish that garage <br/>\nwould be a major debt.  Also, are we wrong in thinking that another <br/>\ngame system is not the best use of the family money when we have <br/>\nother expenses to pay?  I&#39;d be happy to forego a family vacation <br/>\nthis year in lieu of buying a new game system but the kids would <br/>\nlikely be upset as they enjoy family vacations.  Which, btw, we are <br/>\nstill paying off our last vacation to visit the inlaws in Wisconsin <br/>\nlast December.    <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What expenses would he have if he were in school that he doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have because he&#39;s at home?  Those expenses should go back into<br/>\n&gt; his educational concerns.  Unschooling should NOT be less<br/>\n&gt; expensive than government schooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But we can only spend money once.  We&#39;ve already paid more than <br/>\nnormal expenses incurred with being in school.  When I do have extra <br/>\nmoney, I am glad to take him to Gamestop, his favorite store, to buy <br/>\na new video game.  He does not like to save money.  He gets easily <br/>\nfrustrated and will spend anything he&#39;s saved just to have something <br/>\nnew.  I did ask him about starting a saving jar for the Playstation <br/>\n3.  When we have extra money, it can go into the jar and when we <br/>\nsave enough, we can buy the system.  He doesn&#39;t want to do that <br/>\nbecause it will take too long to save.  Isn&#39;t this a maturity issue?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Try to take this well.  You did ask us for help.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, and I am truly listening to what you are saying.  I do want <br/>\nhelp in looking at these issues from a different standpoint.  I&#39;m <br/>\nnot crying or upset.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Here&#39;s what you have inadvertently revealed:  You don&#39;t think he  <br/>\n&gt; needs those things.  You think people who do buy things for their  <br/>\n&gt; children &quot;just run out and buy them.&quot;   You&#39;re feeling virtuous<br/>\n&gt; (or justified, or defensive; not sure) about not running out and<br/>\n&gt; buying him things he doesn&#39;t need anyway.<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, I completely agree I don&#39;t feel he needs those things.  There <br/>\nis a big difference between needs and wants.  Every one of us in <br/>\nthis family has a list of things we want.  How do we determine who&#39;s <br/>\nwants are more important?  If I were to provide everything they <br/>\nwanted, I&#39;d run our Visa up several thousand dollars in one day <br/>\neasily.  If I add the things I want and my DH want, we&#39;d likely go <br/>\nup another couple of thousand dollars.  Am I wrong in thinking that <br/>\nthe children need to understand that we simply cannot have whatever <br/>\nwe want whenever we want it?  If that is the real world, them I&#39;m in <br/>\nthe wrong place!  *laugh*  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do not think people just run out and buy things that I can&#39;t do.  <br/>\nI am saying that my son wants what he wants when he wants it and <br/>\nanything less than immediate gratification will not satisfy him.  <br/>\nThis is the child who asked for a Playstation 2 for months and when <br/>\nwe finally got one, he was asking for a Playstation 3 the very next <br/>\nday.  And remember, he doesn&#39;t like letting things go.  He doesn&#39;t <br/>\nunderstand why he can&#39;t have both systems right now.  In other <br/>\nwords, he obsesses about something until he gets it and then he <br/>\nmoves his obsession onto something else.  He does act happy that he <br/>\nhas the new thing but he doesn&#39;t feel satisfied and content because <br/>\nthere are so many more things he wants.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You want us to help you feel you&#39;re doing the right thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No.  I want y&#39;all to help me look at these things the way y&#39;all do.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s almost like I&#39;m looking through hazy glass.  I can sort of make <br/>\nout what is there, but it&#39;s not crystal clear.  :)<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s possible you could change the way you see his requests.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I see his requests as being perfectly reasonable, honestly.  But how <br/>\ndo I truly give him what he wants when I absolutely do not have the <br/>\nmoney?  Or what if I did have some money?  What if I had $500 right <br/>\nnow today.  Why is his want of a Playstation 3 greater than than the <br/>\nclothes my dd15 needs for her spring break trip with her best <br/>\nfriend?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope I&#39;m speaking clearly.  I swear I do not intend any of this <br/>\nwith a whiny tone.  Maybe I&#39;ll print this out and take it with me to <br/>\nWendy&#39;s house tomorrow (unschooling family) and maybe she can help <br/>\nme see things from a different perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and I did talk with the kids earlier today about the possibility <br/>\nof my getting a part-time job to help earn spending money.  Jeffrey <br/>\nabsolutely hated the idea.  He doesn&#39;t want me working outside the <br/>\nhome.

In other ways because of age and have not had a paying job in years my chances are worse than a 15 yr old. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I throughly enjoy my non paying job :) and dont plan on leaving anytime soon . <br/>\n   <br/>\n  IF I HAD to though the college doors are open .....if i were to go get a 4 year degree it would likely be forst 2 years at a jr college but most ppl pay attention to where you graduated from a lot more than where you went your first year. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  One of my children has a lot of medical expenses . We recently started making $160 a month to much to qualify for medicaid . Suddenly we have aprox $2000 a month in expenses we have to come up with because he is making $160 a month more ..........so more money dosent always benefit you :) <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nLooking for last minute shopping deals?

Put one <br/>\nof his pictures on a jar and start putting money in it.  One quart <br/>\nsized mason jar full of pennies is about $10.  Add nickels, dimes, <br/>\nquarters, dollar bills, maybe even a fiver here and there.  Make <br/>\ndifferent choices at the grocery store.  Buy the generic and put the <br/>\ndifference in his jar.

I suppose we&#39;re just at <br/>\nthe transition from little kid to teenager and he&#39;s got a foot in <br/>\nboth worlds.  This past weekend, we reorganized his room into more <br/>\nof a teen pad, as he called it.  I asked him what 3 things he did <br/>\nmost in his room and he said computer, video games, and hot wheels <br/>\ncars.  He has a huge collection of Lego bricks and creations and <br/>\nthat didn&#39;t even make his top 3, though it&#39;s always been the top of <br/>\nhis list since he was 2.  We worked together to get the room the way <br/>\nhe wanted it and that involved moving some stuff out and into the <br/>\nattic.  We live in a small house with no extra rooms and his bedroom <br/>\nis really small.  His solution to his space problem is for us to <br/>\nmove and that isn&#39;t an option.  At the same time, even though he has <br/>\nso much stuff, he spends alot of time on the computer researching <br/>\nthings he wants.  For example, he really wants a Playstation 3 and I <br/>\njust cannot afford one right now.  He prints out lists and pictures <br/>\nand shows them to us repeatedly throughout the day.  I&#39;m not sure <br/>\nhow to handle it.  I feel guilty that I can&#39;t run out and buy him <br/>\nthe things he feels he needs.  If I try to discuss the matter with <br/>\nhim, he ends up extremely angry so I try not to get into discussions <br/>\nabout those things.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBeth</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":337544642,"authorName":"carnationsgalore","from":"&quot;carnationsgalore&quot; &lt;addled.homemaker@...&gt;","profile":"carnationsgalore","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Two concerns to discuss","postDate":"1205433246","msgId":33019,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZyYnMydStxZHBhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDc0RUE5NUE0LTU0MDgtNDQ1Mi05NjZGLTA1OUVFNjk4NjBFQ0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":33018,"nextInTopic":33020,"prevInTime":33018,"nextInTime":33020,"topicId":33008,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We know kids can get jobs at a grocery store, movie <br/>\ntheater, mall, etc.  We&#39;re so used to thinking that when those kids <br/>\ngraduate and grow up, they generally move on to something else more <br/>\nsubstantial.  My DH thinks of a diploma as a key to open more <br/>\nopportunities.  A person with a diploma can still choose to work in <br/>\njobs that don&#39;t require a diploma, but a person without a diploma is <br/>\nlimited to just that one set of jobs.  When we talk about this, we <br/>\ncan&#39;t find a way to think beyond it.  We keep getting stuck at the <br/>\nthought of the kids turning 30 years old with the same job prospects <br/>\nas when they were 15 years old.  Our personal experience with living <br/>\nexpenses just makes us cringe at the idea that our children will one <br/>\nday be trying to pay for a car, house, family, etc. on a salary <br/>\nmeant for a teenager still in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy DH is open to new ideas.
