I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-208842738\">We have been &quot;de-fooding&quot; for about 2 months now.<br/>\nIt is a success.  I no longer require the kids to eat things they don&#39;t<br/>\nlike. I no longer restrict snacks.<br/>\nI buy healthy and no-so-healthy food.  They choose equally for the most part<br/>\nfrom all the foods.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur son who normally who turns his nose up at anything new is now trying and<br/>\nliking lots of new foods.  Our daughter who used to sneak snacks is now<br/>\nsnacking less frequently (and many times on fruits & veggies).  Both the<br/>\nkids have dropped some weight and are happier with meal times.  If they hate<br/>\nwhat I cooked they can have something else (something that does not require<br/>\nme to cook a second meal)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are 2 small restrictions that still remain and the kids are very<br/>\nagreeable to them....<br/>\n1) they have to ask before they have pop, in case there is not much left<br/>\n(they have many other drink choices as well)<br/>\n2) if a food item is part of a planned meal (which are posted on the fridge<br/>\nweekly) they should not eat it all and screw up the menu plans.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe currently have Oreos, ice cream, wafer cookies, chocolate covered<br/>\npeanuts, pokemon fruit snacks, etc in the house.  These items were bought<br/>\nover 2 weeks ago.  Normally they would have been gone in a few days.  Dole<br/>\nfruit bowls (mandarin oranges) are like GOLD around here, so is apple juice<br/>\nand bananas.  My birthday cake was not completely finished off and had to be<br/>\nthrown out once it got old. (that is a first!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am happy to see that this is working out for us.  I have always had issues<br/>\nwith food.  I am very overweight now, always have been.  I started my first<br/>\ndiet at age 10 at my mother&#39;s request.  She still asks about my weight every<br/>\ntime I see her.  I noticed that I used to eat alot of junk food when I was<br/>\naround my parents.  Now I try to make healthier choices.<br/>\nI was happily surprised to find (when I visited my doc last week) that I<br/>\nhave lost about 6 pounds in 4 weeks.  Slow & steady, without suffering and<br/>\nwithout effort.  So this new way of dealing with food is working for me as<br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\nZan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: meghanfire<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Sunday, August 11, 2002 11:13 PM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Food (was Hawaii Theme Back to School Party)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have the same thing going on here.
