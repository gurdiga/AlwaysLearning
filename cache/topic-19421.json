Please do some <br/>\nself examination or just drop it. Because at this point, you seem <br/>\nunwilling to accept responsibility for your poorly worded post.<br/>\nI have tried to point out gently, and clearly, exactly why it is <br/>\ninsulting. You don&#39;t want to get it. Ok, let&#39;s move on.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot; I know none of us will ever have to see one another<br/>\nface to face and in that there is a security, one in which we can say<br/>\n*anything* we want to each other,&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo. None of us would have to. But many of us have, so there is <br/>\nno &quot;security&quot; in saying anything we want to...most of us say what we <br/>\nfeel is true. We try to say it as clearly and truthfully as <br/>\npossible. <br/>\nThat&#39;s it.<br/>\nI have met Sandra and Kelly and Pam and AnneO and Joyce and Elissa <br/>\nand Robyn and Rue and Karin and Shannon and many other fabulous <br/>\npeople from this list and other lists. I have stayed in other <br/>\nunschoolers homes, I have talked to them on the phone, I have mailed <br/>\nthem things and had them stay in my home. I&#39;m hosting an unschoolers <br/>\nbeach party and will meet many more of them...many from this list.<br/>\nI try really hard to say exactly what I mean, and I am not afraid to <br/>\nmeet people I have questioned on the internet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am happy to continue answering questions about unschooling. I am <br/>\nnot happy to hear more whining about the list, or Sandra (who has <br/>\nchanged many, many lives for the better) or how we are all so mean <br/>\nfor telling the truth.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo please, ask your unschooling questions. Take what is useful, <br/>\ndon&#39;t whine about advice you can&#39;t use. Self examine when <br/>\nsomething &quot;ouches&quot; but don&#39;t stress about it. It is what it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19420,"nextTopicId":19425}}
