Although he&#39;s talking at a broad societal level, the core idea also applies to our individual lives too - that the discussion and arguing of ideas are too important to be controlled or squashed by an outside authority. (He also pulls apart this idea that fear of causing offence is good grounds for restricting free speech - but that&#39;s another discussion ...).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is so wonderful that as unschoolers, parents and children can talk about any topic under the sun. Not only that, but we talk with respect and openness. The other day I was at the park with the kids, and a school group also happened to be there. The kids would&#39;ve been in the 5-7 age range (just like my kids). The way the teachers spoke to them appalled me, not because there was yelling or nastiness, but because there was no respect. They ordered the kids around, and expected immediate obedience. I know I sound naive being shocked by this, as it is so much the norm that most people don&#39;t even hear it, but to my ears it was horrible, as was the thought that the kids are spoken to this way day after day after day.

If they&#39;re thinking of marching band or sports teams, it can be true, but when they&#39;re thinking about a range of topics of discussion or exploration, it all turns.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been carrying a newspaper article around with me hoping to share it and I have a few minutes this morning. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt starts:<br/>\n+++++++++<br/>\nThe NYC Department of Education is generating controversy over its attempt to not generate controversy.  The department released a list of 50 banned words and topics that publishers around the country should avoid if they want to be considered for the job of revamping standardized math and English tests in the city.  Among the list of topics are obvious taboo topics such as violence, drugs and pornography.  Mention of an religious holiday is forbidden. Halloween is banned because fundamentalist Christians think it&#39;s Satanic.  Birthday parties are similarly unmentionable because Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses do not celebrate them.  The word &quot;dinosaur&quot; cannot be used because it might remind creationists of evolution...<br/>\n+++++++++<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s about tests, but the ideas will apply to in-class discussions, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd because of population and money, for years the three states driving educational materials (textbooks, workbooks, tests, all kinds of other things like that (posters, videos) were California, Texas and New York state.  States with smaller population choose from materials aimed at one or more of those states.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to point out what a HUGE luxury it is, and how it opens up the entire world, that unschoolers CAN talk to their kids about anything and everything without considerations of offending Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses (and if they ARE JWs, they can discuss that ALL THEY WANT!), or whatever.  And we can talk about talking about it, too, if it comes up that way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSchools have requirements (things on the curriculum that teachers are expected to present), and schools have prohibitions (things teachers can&#39;t present). Unschoolers can frolic and explore without regard to lawsuits from parents in public schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.
