But I&#39;m finding some very interesting <br/>\nthoughts expressed here, but can&#39;t seem to find the &#39;beginning&#39; of <br/>\nthe discussions I&#39;m interested in reading.  They&#39;re kinda &#39;scattered&#39; <br/>\nunder different thread headings, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome would call me an &#39;ostrich&#39; because I am SO VERY UN-POLITICAL, <br/>\nand don&#39;t follow the political news at all anymore.  Mainly because <br/>\nI&#39;m disgusted with it all....<br/>\n<br/>\nBut these discussions about the pledge of allegiance, political <br/>\naffiliations, etc. are really stirring interest in me to get re-<br/>\ninvolved at least long enough to know what this is all about.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve deleted a lot of emails that probably would have answered all my <br/>\nquestions, but you know how it is when your mailbox gets crammed up <br/>\nand you start getting warnings, I just start deleting the &#39;less&#39; <br/>\nimportant ones just by looking at the subject lines.  Now, I&#39;m afraid <br/>\nI&#39;ve missed some very important stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nToday is &#39;first day of school&#39; here in Oregon, and Steven wanted to <br/>\nhave &#39;our&#39; &#39;first day&#39; today, so we&#39;re going to begin today, at his <br/>\nrequest....<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that aside, as I was reading some &#39;parts&#39; of discussions on this <br/>\nlist, I started getting a little antsy about getting to the bottom of <br/>\nit all....<br/>\n<br/>\nSteven&#39;s grandpa is a retired professor, a WWII vet (and he&#39;s a <br/>\nwalking encyclopedia, too), and he is definately the most patriotic <br/>\noriented person I&#39;ve ever met....<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve learned NOT to even begin political discussions with him, <br/>\nbecause while we disagree with most of his political stands, we <br/>\nrespect him enourmously as our elder, but I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW, <br/>\nthat he&#39;s going to try to teach Steven the pledge of allegiance, (he <br/>\nloves to &#39;drill&#39; him on &#39;what he knows&#39;....which I do everything to <br/>\navoid such a situation) and I need to be prepared for that <br/>\neventuality.<br/>\n<br/>\nApparently there are some things I&#39;m not familiar with regarding the <br/>\npledge.  I would be MOST GRATEFUL for any enlightenment here.  If <br/>\nthere are any articles online, or any feedback from y&#39;all, that would <br/>\nbe great!  I&#39;ve tried peicing together bits and peices of the <br/>\ndiscussions here, but so far, haven&#39;t made heads nor tails about <br/>\nthe &#39;meat&#39; of the matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks muchly,<br/>\nFaye</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9139,"nextTopicId":9024}}
