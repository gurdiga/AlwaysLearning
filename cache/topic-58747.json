I cringe thinking about it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe woman we did this with last year is pretty laid back, but it&#39;s still at the back of my mind as we live day-to-day: &quot;What am I going to show her to show progress commensurate with age and ability in the six categories?&quot;  Oy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;d love to see or hear about examples of what folks do at the end of the year, or how to fit regular life into these categories (health, phys ed, math, literature, natural sciences, fine arts), maybe in ways that aren&#39;t so straightforward. (I&#39;m sure there are those of you who don&#39;t even deal with it, but we did choose to register).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAll I know is that this is my responsibility to pull something together, and I want to keep the pressure off the boys to produce things just to show.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\n<br/>\nWife to Bob<br/>\nMomma to George (12), Theo (9), Eli (6), and Oliver (17 mo)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my life wasn&#39;t funny, it would just be true, and that&#39;s unacceptable.<br/>\n                                                            -- Carrie Fisher</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58561,"nextTopicId":58808}}
