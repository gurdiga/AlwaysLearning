In the UK<br/>\nthere is also at least one annual scything competition - the one we are<br/>\ngoing to takes place next week.<br/>\n<br/>\nJon (my 12 year old son) is adamant that doing a course makes all the<br/>\ndifference between success and failure. He says that one will quickly become<br/>\ndiscouraged because it is hard work if not done correctly. (Apparently it is<br/>\nnot hard at all if done correctly!!!). When he did his course there was - in<br/>\naddition to the course leader - an old man of about 80 who was hard to<br/>\nunderstand as he only had 2 teeth(!) but who shared a wealth of information<br/>\nabout the art of scything - amazing to think that he was scything in the<br/>\ndays when that was the only way to harvest hay!!! Jon couldn&#39;t stop talking<br/>\nabout him. <br/>\n<br/>\nApparently British and American scythes are heavy and unwieldy to use<br/>\ncompared to the Austrian ones. Secondly, it is very important that the<br/>\nscythe is measured correctly to fit the handler, otherwise sore muscles are<br/>\ninevitable. Finally, knowing at what angle to set the blade is important to<br/>\nmake the job easier. And one sharpens the blade briefly every 5 minutes or<br/>\nso while using it. You carry a little jar (fits onto your belt) filled with<br/>\nwater, and your whetstone goes in it, and periodically you get it out and<br/>\nsharpen the blade, and then you continue. There are different whetstones and<br/>\nthe sharpening of the blade is an art all of its own. At the end of the<br/>\nsession you do a proper sharpening so that the blade is ready for next time.<br/>\nTo me (as an observer) the whole procedure is very finicky - you spend so<br/>\nmuch time fiddling and sharpening, but my son assures me that it is because<br/>\nhe is still learning - apparently it gets quicker and quicker to sharpen the<br/>\nblade as time goes on (the afore mentioned old man sharpened and scythed so<br/>\nfast that the others couldn&#39;t even begin to keep up with him). <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I love seeing the most in my son is the passion and enthusiasm. He is<br/>\nloving what he is doing, and I think the very fact that it is finicky, and<br/>\nnot something that everyone can &#39;just do&#39; gives him a kick. And he is sooo<br/>\nproud of his blade - I have to inspect it regularly - he delights in showing<br/>\nme how he repaired a nick or how he sharpened at this angle or that angle<br/>\nfor different purposes, and I peer closely but can&#39;t really see what he<br/>\nmeans, but that is ok too, because he feels quite pleased that he is the one<br/>\nin the know.. And our paddocks are getting cut steadily, bit by bit.. He<br/>\ncomes inside tired and hot and sweaty, but with a huge grin on his face and<br/>\na very peaceful inner self. It looks a lot like he has found a long term<br/>\nhobby.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, it seems that children need to be 8 to start learning the art of<br/>\nscything.

We never schooled at home - went straight from Public Montessori to radical unschooling.  It was a natural - he has always been radically unschooled at home anyway.  We just didn&#39;t call it that; we were simply learning through living life since birth.  In fact we were unschooling for a bit after pulling him from school before we learned there were homeschool groups calling it unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nDad is the stay at home person but we all are living life together and learning together.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is so proud of his unschooling - it always brings a smile to my face.  When people ask him what grade he is in, he responds he is homeschooled.  Then they say, yes but what grade.  He answers &quot;I could be any grade I want, I could be in 12th grade if I wanted.&quot;  (he says it with such pride)  Or if people ask specific questions he will say, we don&#39;t do math or such and such subject, I do what ever I want every day, we&#39;re unschoolers.  We get a lot of frowns that way - even from relatives.  LOL  My sister didn&#39;t even believe him - she just said, oh Zac quit being so silly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re not perfect - I joined this list about a month ago to challenge my (our) thinking a bit more as our son is turning 13 next month and there is no active radical unschool group near us - the ones that say they unschool are not really in our opinion as they have certain requirements such as reading everyday for &quot;X&quot; number of minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have a few questions that are bouncing around in my head but am not sure I&#39;m ready to release them yet - will probably read for a while longer  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  This is so inspiring, Lisa.

It meant the world to him. He cut his finger on the very first day <br/>\nusing it...even under supervision. He didn&#39;t use it too much after that but it <br/>\nmeant the world to him that we got it for him.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy younger son, who we unschool , got one at that same age cuz he wanted it. <br/>\nAgain, he doesn&#39;t use it that much but is so happy he has it. He knows knife <br/>\nsafety and the story about his older brother &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;.<br/>\nHe also loves pouring over websites that have all kinds of weapons. It just <br/>\ninterests him.<br/>\n <br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t worry about what others think. Support his interest...investigate <br/>\nknives and other weapons with him...on the internet...in books, at places etc. <br/>\nEncourage him to learn more about all of them and their history, etc. And <br/>\nlearn safety. <br/>\n <br/>\n~marcia in MA<br/>\nJUSTLIVELIFE<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nIn a message dated 6/8/2007 2:47:03 AM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kimlewismark@...\">kimlewismark@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nMy son, Lewi is 7. At the moment he has a real fascination for, and <br/>\ninterest, in knives. As much as I possibly can I have been nurturing <br/>\nthis interest. I&#39;m finding it difficult though because of the safety <br/>\nissues involved. He likes the look of sharp blades and is interested <br/>\nin what they&#39;re used for. He constantly admires the ones in our <br/>\nkitchen drawers and gets them out and puts them on our bread boards <br/>\nto look at.I&#39;m very present with him when he&#39;s handling the knives <br/>\nand have given lots of info about how to handle them safely etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a couple of things that concern me. One is the reactions <br/>\nI&#39;m getting from others who aren&#39;t understanding why he&#39;d be <br/>\ninterested in something like a knife. They have alot of fear about it <br/>\n(which I totally understand) and have questioned him and me about <br/>\nwhy the interest is there. The other is my concern for his safety and <br/>\nthe safety of others if he happens to show them the knives. I trust <br/>\nthat he won&#39;t do anything dangerous with them on purpose and again, <br/>\nI&#39;m very present when this is happening, but am worried nonetheless, <br/>\nthat an accident could happen. Not sure where my boundaries need to <br/>\nbe with it all. I&#39;ve talked to him about the inportance of not <br/>\nwalking around with them etc and that the drawer is a really safe <br/>\nspot for them unless we&#39;re cutting up vegies etc with them. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe also desperately wants to purchase big types of knives -at the <br/>\nmoment it&#39;s a machette. We&#39;ve had lots of discussion about this, and <br/>\nthat will continue. I&#39;m really feeling like I need to say no to alot <br/>\nof these sorts of things though because of his age. We&#39;ve been into <br/>\nthe King Of Knives store (while we were in Sydney) and he found a <br/>\nsword letter opener that he wants to buy. This would be safe as it&#39;s <br/>\nnot really sharp. We&#39;re talking about getting a small pocket knife as <br/>\nwell. My dad has found him an antique scythe that he&#39;s going to hang <br/>\nup on his wall in his room and we&#39;ve been to Allens and got a nice <br/>\nnew knife set for the kitchen which includes a meat cleaver <br/>\n(something he&#39;s loved for awhile now). I&#39;m feeling like I&#39;m doing as <br/>\nmuch as I can to help him get what he needs but the machette etc <br/>\nfeels like it&#39;s way too much at the moment. He&#39;s very upset about my <br/>\ndecision and my saying no to it. I guess I just needed to hear what <br/>\nsome of your thoughts are on this and whether I could handle this in <br/>\na much better way.<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks so much<br/>\n<br/>\nKim <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29167,"nextTopicId":29235}}
