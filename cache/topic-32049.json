He loves creating videos and sharing  <br/>\nthem, but the social aspect of the whole YouTube community is  <br/>\nconfusing to him.  I&#39;ve been trying to learn more so that I can assist  <br/>\nhim, but much of it is confusing to me as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre any of your kids involved with YouTube and if so, is there a way  <br/>\nto connect into that group of kids?  I just feel that there&#39;s got to  <br/>\nbe some unschooling kids having fun with making videos and sharing  <br/>\nthem with each other.  My son&#39;s YouTube account is GamerGuy628 if you  <br/>\nwant to check it out.  He&#39;d LOVE it if some other unschoolers  <br/>\ncommented, asked to be his friend or subscribed to his channel!<br/>\n<br/>\nHe really wants people to watch his videos and comment and become  <br/>\nsubscribers, but doesn&#39;t know how to bring people to his channel.   <br/>\nI&#39;ve tried to explain the viral effect of the videos that get watched  <br/>\na lot, but that&#39;s not satisfying him.  He&#39;s gotten some rude comments  <br/>\nand those who have wanted to join aren&#39;t kids but mostly teens and  <br/>\nolder with some pretty weird stuff on their own channels.  I&#39;ve talked  <br/>\nto him about the fact that YouTube leans more to older people (My son  <br/>\nis 9) and that maybe there was a site out there that was similar to  <br/>\nYouTube but geared for a younger set.  If you know of any, please let  <br/>\nme know.<br/>\n<br/>\nYouTube has been a very creative and expansive experience for him.  He  <br/>\nis an artist and has a passion for creating both animation and live  <br/>\nvideos.  Though he is a novice, I&#39;ve been really amazed with all that  <br/>\nhe has picked up just by watching other videos and trying different  <br/>\nideas out for himself.  Most of his humor is  pretty typical 9 year  <br/>\nold boy bathroom humor and probably wouldn&#39;t be appreciated by uptight  <br/>\nmoms!   That&#39;s one of the reasons we haven&#39;t shared them with many of  <br/>\nour more traditional family friends.  But I&#39;m sure there are families  <br/>\nin this community who would appreciate his humor and artist talents!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is all a big learning curve for both of us.  Any thoughts would  <br/>\nbe helpful!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nSunday</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32046,"nextTopicId":32050}}
