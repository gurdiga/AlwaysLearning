Writing that‚Äôs honest and practical and that will be received by some people who will be thinking as they read it of whether and how they could apply the ideas in their own real lives, that very day, or week, or season.  Or someday.  Or comparing it to what they know and letting it strengthen their own existing ideas and practices.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore to come from me later, but if others here have already brought so many good examples that mine are superfluous, that would be just fine. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"sandralynndodd","from":"&quot;sandralynndodd&quot; &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Real Writing","postDate":"1338962937","msgId":67507,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpxbXM1cCtwajNjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":78433,"prevInTime":67506,"nextInTime":67508,"topicId":67507,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My e-mail isn t going out right for some reason, and as I was starting to respond to an e-mail (from someone on this list), I realized I could write and write","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-111629085\">My e-mail isn&#39;t going out right for some reason, and as I was starting to respond to an e-mail (from someone on this list), I realized I could write and write and she wouldn&#39;t get a response.

I think you&#39;ve been writing more, and for a real audience, about things that were important to you and that they actually needed to know, and wanted to read.  That is real writing, in the real world.  Because of that your writing probably IS better.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the writing students do for teachers is pretend, practice writing.  Every report written in school is a practice report, not a real report.  Kids are writing about something that&#39;s already known, for people who don&#39;t really want to know.  A real report is like this: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/windsor-ox-roast.html\">http://sandradodd.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/windsor-ox-roast.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nEven if just one person reads it who thinks it&#39;s interesting, I&#39;ve provided information that they couldn&#39;t get another way. I was an eye witness.  And I link to other reports from other years.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a real report, because I was reporting what I saw and what I knew about what I saw:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/beacon-lit-in-staines.html\">http://sandradodd.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/beacon-lit-in-staines.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf you write about what you have done at your house, and what you thought about it, that&#39;s reporting about family relationships, child development, the results of different methods and ideas put into practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you share ideas on Always Learning, that&#39;s analysis and collaboration and the clarification of other people&#39;s ideas.  Sometimes that&#39;s rephrasing and sometimes that&#39;s finding the seed of truth in a jumble of data.  Sometimes it&#39;s sorting emotion from evidence.<br/>\n<br/>\nWriting to real people for real purposes improves writing in real ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78437,"nextTopicId":78440}}
