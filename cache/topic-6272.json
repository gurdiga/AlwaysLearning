It is interesting to note that my first<br/>\nhusband was an officer in the air force. Most of the wives that I<br/>\nencountered while we were married wouldn&#39;t say boo without their husbands. I<br/>\nwas always going on day trips to a nearby city when we first got married<br/>\nbecause there wasn&#39;t anything to do where we lived. And I would sometimes go<br/>\nto the movies by myself. The other wives would say things like &quot;you are so<br/>\nlucky that your husband *lets* you do that.&quot; And I would say my husband was<br/>\nat work when I went to the city so what would it even have to do with him.<br/>\nAnd regarding the movies,I would tell them, if I wanted to see a movie, and<br/>\nhe didn&#39;t I would just go by myself. I would also remind them that I was an<br/>\nadult and didn&#39;t need &quot;permission&quot;. (I was just barely 20 when we married<br/>\nand most of those wives were older than me) They would also tell me that<br/>\nthey were &quot;afraid&quot; to drive that far by themselves, or go to the movies by<br/>\nthemselves, even if their husband would *let* them. Some of those wives<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t even go to a doctor&#39;s appointment without their husband! It really<br/>\nagravated my ex that I wasn&#39;t more like those other wives, which explains<br/>\nwhy he is my ex!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I am married to an enlisted man in the air force, and most of the wives<br/>\nthat I meet are very independent and never ask their husband&#39;s permission<br/>\nfor anything. Although they do discuss plans with their husbands. Since my<br/>\ncurrent dh and I have been married, he has gone on several hunting and<br/>\nfishing trips. Now instead of anyone ever being surprised that my husband<br/>\n&quot;lets&quot; me do something or go somewhere without him, they are surprised or<br/>\nimpressed that I &quot;let&quot; him go on these trips without me! No one ever asks me<br/>\nabout my husband &quot;letting&quot; me do anything. But when he goes hunting or<br/>\nfishing they will say things like, &quot;you *let* him go, for how long?&quot; Or &quot;How<br/>\nwonderful that you *let* him do things like that!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter my oldest ds turned 18, it took a while to break him of asking<br/>\npermission to go places and do things. I had to keep telling him that he<br/>\nonly had to ask permission to use my car, not to go. I told him that he just<br/>\nneeded to let us know what his plans were, but he did not need permission<br/>\nnow that he was an adult. My daughter, however, had no problem making that<br/>\ntransission. As soon as she turned 18, she quit asking permission and just<br/>\nstarted announcing that she was going to do something or go somewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuzanna</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6271,"nextTopicId":6274}}
