The hours are highly variable, from 0-10 per week.  I try to do most of my work from 3:30-5:30/6pm when Audrey and Tyler are napping most of that time.  I have a 13 year old &quot;mother&#39;s helper&quot; come over during that time. She plays games with James and gets the other kids up if/when they wake up.  Her only &quot;role&quot; is to play with them, so they look at it as fun.  I plan snacks ahead of time and even tell her to let me know if a diaper needs changing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I can&#39;t get my work done in the hours she can be here that week, then I grab an hour in the evening, or a few on the weekend.  My only anxiety is when I have a client phone call.  It happens infrequently, but I absolutely can&#39;t be interrupted during the teleconference.  I have a hard time relaxing and not anticipating that I am going to be needed. Fortunately, most of my work is solitary, online, and just requires thinking and writing and not much phone time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe money I make is helpful to round out our variable expenses budget sometimes (groceries, clothes, books, toys, money to go to the pool and eat lunch out,etc) but doesn&#39;t make a dent in our fixed expenses (mortgage, insurance, utilities, etc).  In all reality, I am forgoing a $125K+ salary per year by not working.  That&#39;s a huge deal to some people (my relatives, friends and neighbors sometimes lament my &quot;wasted potential&quot;), but we don&#39;t want to live in the rat race of daycare sucking up the income, work wardrobes, new more reliable cars, commuting, rushing, enforced schedules, and, needless to say, school. I&#39;d rather put that effort into my relationships with my kids (and my husband, who makes our free lives possible).<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\nJames, 4.75y and can&#39;t WAIT to be 5!<br/>\nTyler, just turned 3y<br/>\nAudrey, almost 11 months and getting her top front teeth</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":326782993,"authorName":"Vidyut Kale","from":"Vidyut Kale &lt;wide.aware@...&gt;","profile":"vidyutgore","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Worked/ing or stayed/ing home when kids were/are \tyounger?","postDate":"1276599776","msgId":54967,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGluR080eURxTGlUdEVjbHJGYlRWb3VfWVlLMklDZ2ZacGRzdWcxQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGh2MzczYitqbHYzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGh2MzczYitqbHYzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54965,"nextInTopic":54968,"prevInTime":54966,"nextInTime":54968,"topicId":54914,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My baby is young.

We didn&#39;t have a<br/>\nwhole lot of disposable income available at any given moment and we did the<br/>\nbest with what we had -- including many trips to California (including<br/>\ndisneyland), unschooling conferences, visits to friends who lived hours<br/>\naway.

I quit my job to be at home with our son full-time when he was two (or perhaps to be more accurate, so he could be at home with me full-time) after our complicated lifestyle had become rather stressful and we had crunched the numbers and discovered that most of my income was being spent on doing what I needed to do to earn the income in the first place. It was an unexpected finding and a lesson learned - it&#39;s not just about salaries and wages: take into account when assessing income the financial cost of earning that income. So, initially, when I quit my job, we had to tighten our belts but not really by that much. Then, because my wife was now free to focus on her career, her income started to rise and I would say probably no more than two years later our net family income was what it had been when we&#39;d both been working. <br/>\n<br/>\nSomething similar happened when we took our son out of school in 2002. Only this time it produced a financial bonus. At the time, I was still a stay-at-home dad. I&#39;d chosen to continue with that even though my son was now in his second year at school because he&#39;d never settled at school and I wanted to be free to get into the school at every opportunity to watch over him. He attended a private Catholic school. After the decision was made to remove him and educate him at home, a whole range of expenditures disappeared from our lives - fees, uniforms, out of school activities, the money the school always seemed to be after for one thing or another... In the past seven plus years, my wife and I have saved probably tens of thousands of dollars that would have been the cost of sending our son to school.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in both those cases, everybody was so much happier, so what we did would have been worth doing even if it hadn&#39;t worked out for us financially.<br/>\n<br/>\nBob</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":441442501,"authorName":"katelovessunshine","from":"&quot;katelovessunshine&quot; &lt;misskate@...&gt;","profile":"katelovessunshine","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Worked/ing or stayed/ing home when kids were/are younger?","postDate":"1276487881","msgId":54928,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGh2NDljOStqczFpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGh2MzczYitqbHYzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54926,"nextInTopic":54934,"prevInTime":54927,"nextInTime":54929,"topicId":54914,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We ve worked together to make make it happen sometimes it seems like we re a tag-team... coming & going to have an adult home and attend to everything else we","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1210749713\">We&#39;ve worked together to make make it happen sometimes it seems like we&#39;re a tag-team... coming & going to have an adult home and attend to everything else we needed to do to support our family.

I know there are some families with much older kids now who may choose or be able to work but what about when your kids are younger. Do you simply make the choice to be broke all the time so that one parent can be home for sure or have you had to work outside the family and if so how did it work. I know people who want to keep their kids home but sometimes can&#39;t because they need the income and have to make a choice. anyway, I&#39;m kind of not sure exactly how to phrase this otherwise. I think I got the jist of what I wanted to say across. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nLaura Z<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://livingandlearninginfreedom.blogspot.com\">http://livingandlearninginfreedom.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://movingtoargentina.typepad.com\">http://movingtoargentina.typepad.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54958,"nextTopicId":54825}}
