They were fm USA and had lived longer in Japan than I<br/>\nhad. They<br/>\nhomeschooled, that is, every time we met we all played.  The year<br/>\nbefore last<br/>\nI went to teach &quot;intercultural communication&quot; to a ps in the area<br/>\nwe live.  I<br/>\nwanted to see how the ps in our area looked like.  There were fm<br/>\n32 to 41<br/>\npupils in each class.  I played bingo, sang songs, told my<br/>\npersonal story,<br/>\ndanced with them.  Pupils in the grade 6 could not keep their<br/>\nknees under the<br/>\ndesk, classes and activities were minutely assigned, the walls<br/>\nwere mostly<br/>\ngray, the three teachers of grade one taught the same lessons on<br/>\nthe same day.  They only had 20 min. brake to play after the 20<br/>\nmin. lunch time.  That was a place that I would not want to spend<br/>\nmost of the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe international school near out place asked for six thousand<br/>\nyear tuition.  For that amount of money, I decided that I could<br/>\neducate my dd.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne day fm my way home fm the ps classes, I found &quot;How children<br/>\nlearn&quot; John Holt.  After 2 days I was convinced that children are<br/>\nlearning beings, there were no need to teach them.<br/>\n......<br/>\nAs for hs in Japan, pls visit the home page that the family of 5<br/>\nfm USA have built. : <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolinginjapan.org\">http://www.homeschoolinginjapan.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMy time on the computer is over.  love and peace.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6797,"nextTopicId":6828}}
