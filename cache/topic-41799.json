Our dd has never<br/>\nbeen to &#39;school.&#39; She will be 7 next month. We have a 2, almost 3,<br/>\nyear old at home as well. When we started our homeschooling journey I<br/>\nhad it in my mind that we would &#39;school&#39; at home. It wasn&#39;t even my<br/>\ndesire, it was my husbands that we homeschool. I told him before I<br/>\nshot it down I&#39;d live with it and learn about it. I loved it the idea<br/>\nof it at then end of the month I gave myself to investigate the<br/>\nnotion. Schooling at home. Then I learned fast after giving that a try<br/>\n(school at home) it would not work for us. I visited Sandra&#39;s website<br/>\nand then started moving in the direction of unschooling. Deschooling<br/>\nmyself mostly. Our day looks like this sort of. They are different all<br/>\nthe time. (We have some classes that Emma requested during the week.<br/>\nDrama, Math fun and games, Spanish, and Science.  We stop them if they<br/>\nare not what she thought they&#39;d be.)<br/>\nEmma awakens with a list of interests she wants to explore. Today it<br/>\nwas making an &#39;All about Me&#39; book that turned into an &#39;All about YOU<br/>\nbook.&#39; People of all different types. She has created a world just for<br/>\nthem. Then she had a stack of books to read with me. I read, she<br/>\nreads. She is still not sure about reading. Then back to book making.<br/>\nPrincesses of all sorts. She illustrates and tells me what to write<br/>\nand when she wants, she writes. Now she is watching Mulan 2 with her<br/>\nGrandma who came to visit. We do all sorts of things and I make a<br/>\nmental list in my mind of what she is learning and doing because I<br/>\nstill *worry* about are we doing enough. Some times I write down what<br/>\nI notice and see her doing because I need that confirmation. I am<br/>\nstill deschooling. So I looked up the definition of unschooling and<br/>\nfound this link:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling</a><br/>\nI love these new groups I have found. Thanks to Rue Kream&#39;s book:<br/>\n&quot;Raising a Free Child.&quot;<br/>\nI love how unschooling feels. I see Emma (and our son, Simon too)<br/>\ngrowing and learning all the time. It just looks way different than I<br/>\nhad thought. I will keep deschooling myself and learn with them. I did<br/>\nthink to myself the other day while &#39;worrying&#39;, &quot;Am I having fun?&quot; <br/>\nI think mostly I am but I worry too because it is off the beaten path<br/>\nfrom where I have journeyed. I am worrying a little less though I<br/>\nthink then I was last year. <br/>\nThanks for listening! I&#39;m glad to be here with you!<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nDory</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41659,"nextTopicId":41805}}
