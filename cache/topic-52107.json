It is best to find a team in your area so that the kids have some guidance.  You can Google &quot;airsoft&quot; with your location and you should come up with a team in your area.  For example our team is the Kansas City Airsoft Club, otherwise known as KNACK.  Pease feel free to visit our boards to get a feel for what we do. Another team in our area is known as Dan&#39;s Toy Shop, and you can google them as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe find that this feeds a healthy dose of interest in many types of weapons, builds camaraderie as well as teaching gun safety.<br/>\n<br/>\nEd Wendell<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":301108410,"authorName":"Marina DeLuca-Howard","from":"Marina DeLuca-Howard &lt;delucahoward@...&gt;","profile":"matedgirl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Responding to desires that feel dangerous","postDate":"1268796940","msgId":52125,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3NGRmOWRjMTAwMzE2MjAzNXY0NmQxMGNlYXdmMTRiNWNmMzc5NmJhMzQ4QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDM5MzQ2NTQ3LTJFQTgtNDA0RS05QTU4LThDQTg2OEU3NjA3MkBlbWlseWpvLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGhubzRyZiticTJiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgkgPDM5MzQ2NTQ3LTJFQTgtNDA0RS05QTU4LThDQTg2OEU3NjA3MkBlbWlseWpvLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":52123,"nextInTopic":52126,"prevInTime":52124,"nextInTime":52126,"topicId":52107,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The comparison between the gun and the dirtbike doesn t make sense to me.

I am uncomforable about this weapon.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; By way of a little background, both of my sons have had an interest in guns for a number of years.  We took them to gun safety courses in the Boston area, they joined a junior gun club where they learned to shoot 22 rifles.  They had bb guns as little boys, they have airsoft guns and paintball guns - all of which they really enjoy. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We spend quite a bit of time in the western U.S. where we have fmaily, a little cabin.  Our families are hunters, the boys talk guns to their cousins and uncles, sometimes they get to shoot larger caliber guns with older cousins, etc.  Our sons are clear they don&#39;t want to hunt, but really like target practice.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Two years ago we purchased and licensed under our names, each of them a 22.  I felt nervous about these guns, too, at the time.  Now they don&#39;t seem like a big deal at all. They&#39;ve enjoyed these guns off and on.  Now, Dan is pressing for a larger caliber rifle which I think is fine.  It&#39;s just that he wants an assault rifle.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe it&#39;s the name I&#39;m uncomfortable with . . . it&#39;s also called an armorlite rifle.  It looks like a military issue weapon - not a hunting or sporting or target practice gun.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Admittedly, with each step in this process I&#39;ve had to breathe alot.  I grew up with guns, my dad and brother were hunters and avid gun collectors. I&#39;m thankful for that in regards to my son&#39;s interests.  On the other hand,  to purchase an object that can maim, and kill in the blink of an eye feels counterintuitive to me as their mother.  Honestly, this particular weapon and his desire for it scares me.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s also quite expensive - yet, I keep asking myself if he wanted a horse or dirtbike for the same money, I would figure out a way to get it.  Both of those desires are potentially dangerous as well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know - I&#39;m stumped and struggling for how to respond to him.<br/>\n&gt; And I guess as I write there&#39;s a little corner of concern I have about his temper.  This gun seems to bring up a wall in me, a boundary . . <br/>\n&gt; and reveal a little lack of trust for his ability to handle this kind of gun. Part of me just wants to say, honey, I can&#39;t do this, you&#39;ll need to wait til you&#39;re 21 to buy this for yourself.  But, then, as an unschooling parent/partner I want to support all his interests . . .  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d appreciate hearing how people have responded to their teens around similiar issues.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thank you - Ann<br/>\n&gt; (Dan, 17, Joe, 17, Nora, 15)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

Our families are hunters, the boys talk guns to their cousins and uncles, sometimes they get to shoot larger caliber guns with older cousins, etc.  Our sons are clear they don&#39;t want to hunt, but really like target practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo years ago we purchased and licensed under our names, each of them a 22.  I felt nervous about these guns, too, at the time.  Now they don&#39;t seem like a big deal at all. They&#39;ve enjoyed these guns off and on.  Now, Dan is pressing for a larger caliber rifle which I think is fine.  It&#39;s just that he wants an assault rifle.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it&#39;s the name I&#39;m uncomfortable with . . . it&#39;s also called an armorlite rifle.  It looks like a military issue weapon - not a hunting or sporting or target practice gun.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAdmittedly, with each step in this process I&#39;ve had to breathe alot.  I grew up with guns, my dad and brother were hunters and avid gun collectors. I&#39;m thankful for that in regards to my son&#39;s interests.  On the other hand,  to purchase an object that can maim, and kill in the blink of an eye feels counterintuitive to me as their mother.  Honestly, this particular weapon and his desire for it scares me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s also quite expensive - yet, I keep asking myself if he wanted a horse or dirtbike for the same money, I would figure out a way to get it.  Both of those desires are potentially dangerous as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know - I&#39;m stumped and struggling for how to respond to him.<br/>\nAnd I guess as I write there&#39;s a little corner of concern I have about his temper.  This gun seems to bring up a wall in me, a boundary . . <br/>\nand reveal a little lack of trust for his ability to handle this kind of gun. Part of me just wants to say, honey, I can&#39;t do this, you&#39;ll need to wait til you&#39;re 21 to buy this for yourself.  But, then, as an unschooling parent/partner I want to support all his interests . . .  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d appreciate hearing how people have responded to their teens around similiar issues.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you - Ann<br/>\n(Dan, 17, Joe, 17, Nora, 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52124,"nextTopicId":46017}}
