Would any of you..care to comment and help me<br/>\nout?<br/>\nJulie in MO<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot; I really didnt miss the point, the public school system needs work.  I<br/>\nprefer not to dwell on how the system failed, because I cant do anything<br/>\nabout the past, blaming history and the NEA doesnt correct the problem.<br/>\nThose of you that chose an alternate form of education can&#39;t be absolved<br/>\nfrom working to effect a change for those who dont have that option.   I<br/>\nfeel that a choice to home school is a wonderful option, and works well if<br/>\nthe parent and child are motivated.   But to run away from the system is<br/>\nisolationism and believing that the world is all bad isn&#39;t a way to make the<br/>\nworld a better place.  It is most optimal to be on the School Board as an<br/>\nindividual, or to vote for the right people to be on the School Board rather<br/>\nthan to let it be taken over by &quot;subversives.&quot;  Voting for checks on the<br/>\nteachers, being a volunteer in the schools (did you know that the Red Cross<br/>\ntrains teachers aides to be helpful in the classroom so that the teacher can<br/>\nspend more time teaching and less time babysitting?)   There are so many<br/>\nways to help, and I have seen schools all across America that are wonderful,<br/>\ncaring places to send our children.  But what are you doing about the<br/>\nproblem? In the places where my kids went to school, I worked to better the<br/>\nsystem and am still involved with that. I will try to be more active in<br/>\npursuing changes through political avenues, and will do all I can to stress<br/>\nlearning for my grandchildren. Ever the optimist, I believe that we can<br/>\neffect a change if we work at it, and I am happy to say that not all corrupt<br/>\nindividuals get on the school board. Parents have every right to ask for<br/>\nbetter education for their kids.  When the parents don&#39;t get involved, don&#39;t<br/>\nlisten to their kids about the bad teachers, and don&#39;t care, that is when<br/>\nthe schools break down.  Ultimately it is our obligation, when we bring<br/>\nchildren into this world, to do the best that we can for them and take<br/>\nresponsibility for them.  Some of us don&#39;t have the time, because of the<br/>\nneed to make a living, or the abilities to teach, or even the inclination to<br/>\nhome school.  Often, because they feel that their children need more than<br/>\nthey can deliver.  So we go to PTA meetings, are active with the schools,<br/>\nand take board positions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe (the American people) don&#39;t need to justify our choices in the way we<br/>\neducate ourselves and our children. We just need to do the best we are able<br/>\nto do. I have found that we can learn as much as we want to learn...my<br/>\noptimism is showing here. It would be great if there was a perfect system,<br/>\nbut those who want to be educated can be, in spite of the system. And the<br/>\nwonderful thing is that we and our children can choose to continue learning<br/>\nall our life.  If we goofed up, we can try again and again.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe may have a flawed public school system in some cases. Likewise, there are<br/>\nsome inherent flaws with the Home Schooling system.  For example, a lack of<br/>\nconstant monitoring to ensure progress is being made.  There should be<br/>\nannual testing to ensure that the teaching is being accomplished so that the<br/>\nchildren will stand a fighting chance when they enter the real world.  I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t feel qualified to take on the responsibility for teaching all the<br/>\ndiverse information that my kids need in these high-technology times. I<br/>\nadmire you for being confident enough to accept that awesome job.<br/>\n<br/>\nLets hope that in the long run, in spite of us, in spite of our parents and<br/>\nin spite of the system, our families will be happy and take responsibility<br/>\nfor the way they want to live. We make mistakes, we learn, we try, then we<br/>\ntrust that we all choose the right road.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4786,"nextTopicId":4793}}
