You can create a situation where he feels a need to be sneaky about drinking, or where he decides he&#39;d rather move out and go on drinking, but you don&#39;t have to do those things. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor years George drank - sometimes just one or two beers, sometimes, if he was in a rotten mood a whole twelve pack, sometimes more than that. Twelve beers wasn&#39;t enough for George to be drunk, that might give you an indication of how regular a drinker he was. He wasn&#39;t abusive, wasn&#39;t an ass when he&#39;d drink a lot, just sort of lethargic. I never gave him any kind of hassle about drinking and the vast majority of the time he didn&#39;t ask me to buy it for him. I&#39;m generally pretty kind to George, we have a warm, friendly relationship with lots of mutual care in it. A few years back he decided to stop drinking and did, just like that. He said he decided it was a lousy strategy for dealing with his funky moods, that it was effecting his health and leaving him less available for the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy favorite aunty has (had?) a drinking problem - she used to get drunk when she was unhappy. Its a different sort of issue than someone who &quot;drinks too much&quot;. She would get out of control, get hurt, lash out verbally at other people. Her husband is gentle and supportive, didn&#39;t give her grief for her drinking, although he confessed to me that he worried about that. Last year she decided to go to treatment and hasn&#39;t had any alcohol to drink since, even in the sorts of circumstances that would have sent her to the bottle in the past - she&#39;s learning to handle her problems in other ways. <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople stop drinking because they choose to. It doesn&#39;t have to be a traumatic process of &quot;hitting bottom&quot; the way AA makes it out to be. Given kindness and a comfortable life, people can choose to change. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This morning when I woke and could smell the beer around him I felt so angry. <br/>\n&gt; But I realize that behind my anger is fear, for him, for me not knowing how to <br/>\n&gt; handle this, for not doing enough, and sadness.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can feel those things without making your son responsible for them. You don&#39;t have to agree with all his decisions, or think they&#39;re all the greatest decisions in order to be supportive. It will help him more if you can be supportive of him and not put down his decisions. If he wanted to do something dangerous - my brother used to race bicycles and now is an amature car racer, not exactly the safest of hobbies - you could be scared for him and supportive of him at the same time. In a way, his decision to go out drinking with friends is that kind of decision. It has risks, but chances are your son knows those risks. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":258687292,"authorName":"Josh Moll","from":"Josh Moll &lt;josje_wosje@...&gt;","profile":"josje_wosje","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"worry about drinking","postDate":"1280551730","msgId":56488,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ3MDc3OS4yNzU2NC5xbUB3ZWI1MjYwNi5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":56498,"prevInTime":56487,"nextInTime":56489,"topicId":56488,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"dear everyone, I am looking for some advice how to handle my sons drinking.
