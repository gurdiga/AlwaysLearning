To be clear, I don&#39;t pressure him to ask questions.  You <br/>\ntook only part of a thought.  The entire sentence is key because if <br/>\nyou asked him what he liked doing or what he thought was cool he&#39;d <br/>\nsay &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; This from a very articulate and opinionated <br/>\nchild. We are new to this, from an environment where we are the only <br/>\nfamily that we know taking this approach.  We are being questioned <br/>\nand judged nearly continually.  So, I do need to feel more confident <br/>\nin what my heart is telling me is right for us. Please note I said I <br/>\nkeep &quot;wanting to&quot; not that I feel I agree with it or am continuing <br/>\nto do so- another sentence you took only in part.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat he does is very important to me whatever it is.  However it has <br/>\nonly been 2 months and he really just wants to sleep, watch TV, play <br/>\nvideo games.  Not in and of themselves negative things. During the <br/>\nSummer he&#39;s my &quot;roaddawg&quot;.  He&#39;s always wanting to be on the go.  <br/>\nHe&#39;s typically very depressed and irritable during the school year.  <br/>\nI just wish that he was more like out of school Kameron since he&#39;s <br/>\nnot in a school.    Our state however does require certain things.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe public/private schoolers judge and challenge everything we do.  <br/>\nThe best lesson I&#39;ve learned from you is that, though well intended <br/>\nhome/unschoolers will too.

For myself I wish I&#39;d <br/>\nhad a non-traditional education.  I did well because I was a <br/>\nperformer, a people pleaser.  But, I definately was very unhappy and <br/>\nfelt like noone could believe in what I knew my real talents and <br/>\nfocus should be. Therefore not worth exploring or nurturing.   I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want my children to waste their lives chasing someone elses <br/>\ndream.

Phase two is them giving you the answer and telling you you&#39;re not so <br/>\nsmart.  I&#39;d heard that before.  I was already learning to let it slide on off.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut he didn&#39;t know either. <br/>\n<br/>\nI pressed him again, and said why didn&#39;t HE know if he was asking me?

Not all.  Some adults when I was little knew TONS <br/>\nof stuff, and lots of it I knew they didn&#39;t learn in school.  Stuff about <br/>\ngo-carts and motorcycles, fishing and trapping and hunting, what plants to plant <br/>\nwhen and where.  My granny crocheted with stuff about the size of fat thread, <br/>\nand she could put words in, and pictures of eagles.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe capital of South Dakota didn&#39;t seem like something they could use, living <br/>\nin Texas.  And me, in New Mexico, I knew the capital of New Mexico and the <br/>\ncapital of Texas, and I had no reason to even know those!   I couldn&#39;t drive, <br/>\nand I had no legal business to attend to in second grade. &lt;g&gt;  I knew some other <br/>\ncapitals too, but those others I had learned from a map puzzle I had.  When <br/>\nthe pieces were out of the frame you could see the capital city with a mark for <br/>\nits location.    New England was just divided into three pieces, though, with <br/>\nmore than one state on each, so to this day New England is lumpy and vague in <br/>\nmy head. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: I&#39;m Bored........","postDate":"1075478830","msgId":18588,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyYy4zYWEzOTc2Ni4yZDRiZGIyZUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":18587,"nextInTopic":18589,"prevInTime":18587,"nextInTime":18589,"topicId":18400,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/29/04 11:00:18 PM, wifetovegman2002@yahoo.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1564307327\">In a message dated 1/29/04 11:00:18 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wifetovegman2002@...\">wifetovegman2002@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; <br/>\nBut Taunya had stated she finally &quot;got my son to ask<br/>\nquestions about the things he is interested in.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nRight.<br/>\nAnd I think she&#39;ll do much better asking HIM questions about the things he&#39;s <br/>\ninterested in.

You&#39;ll have more success by just having conversation with your kids.  You can learn amazing things about their thought process and what they&#39;ve learned from their experiences, if you just listen to them. Sometimes -- often in fact -- I wait a moment after they ask a question (or answer with a hmm to their observations and announcements) because usually it&#39;s really part of a bigger question or concept, that will unfold more easily if I don&#39;t pounce right in with a question or a complex explanation.<br/>\n <br/>\nFor example, this week Andy has figured out money, and it&#39;s happened in spurts all week.  For months he&#39;s been obsessed with saving allowance from week to week to buy things, but really had no grasp of anything but dollars and pricetags. It was also very confusing for him that dimes are smaller than nickels, but worth more! A couple of days ago, he came to me and announced mid-conversation &#39;12 quarters is 300 pennies and that&#39;s 3 dollars.&#39;  I said &#39;you&#39;re right, it is&#39; and dropped it at that.  This morning the conversation went like this:<br/>\n <br/>\nA:  12 quarters are 300 cents, 3 dollars.  <br/>\nMe:  mm hmm <br/>\nA:  so 16 quarters is ..... (thinking for a minute) 400 pennies and that&#39;s 4 dollars!<br/>\nMe:  yep, that&#39;s right. <br/>\nA:  and 3 dimes is 30 cents.  So, if Ed, Edd & Eddy had 30 cents they could buy 6 jawbreakers, because jawbreakers cost 5 cents each, and that&#39;s 6 nickels, which is 3 dimes -- 30 cents!<br/>\n <br/>\nThen later at McDonalds, after finding he could only buy one burter for his dollar, he said, &quot;if they sold burgers for 50cents, then I could have 2!<br/>\n <br/>\nHe has learned all this thru his own observations. He figured it on his own, when it made sense to him, because it was now important to him to know.  And he has the pleasure of knowing he did it without being &#39;taught&#39; by someone else.  He&#39;s learned that he&#39;s capable and smart -- something you just can&#39;t get from a worksheet with some arcane facts memorized.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd that&#39;s how they reach the point of &#39;wanting to learn&#39; -- when it matters to them, not when it matters to you or anyone else.<br/>\n <br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

I<br/>\nthink we all can.  For my dd, I think it&#39;s a matter of not having lots of<br/>\nother people around to share her interests (she prefers large groups of<br/>\npeople, but alas we are a family of 3.)  Also, it seems to come up when she<br/>\nis interested in more of an intellectual challenge.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my dd complains to me about being bored, I try not to think of it as<br/>\nsomething that she shouldn&#39;t be.  At the same time I try to help her feel<br/>\nmore comfortable about it.  Sometimes when she says &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; she&#39;s not<br/>\nreally asking me for solutions... she just needs to connect with me, and is<br/>\nsharing where she is at.  So I will often just give her a hug and let the<br/>\nsituation unfold - she might then ask me for ideas about what to do, or she<br/>\nmight then run off and do her own thing, or she might start to talk about<br/>\nsomething else.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce when we were visiting my Mom and my dd said she was bored my Mom<br/>\nrecalled how her Mom used to say &#39;well, you can always clean the bathroom&#39;.<br/>\nI mention this because the next time we were at home and my dd said she was<br/>\nbored she said &#39;Hey, I know, I&#39;ll clean the bathroom!&quot;  So, she became<br/>\nCinderella and she asked me to be the wicked stepmother who ordered her<br/>\naround.

Invite your kids to<br/>\nparticipate in your life.  Ask if they would like to help with one of your<br/>\nprojects.  Make sure you slow yourself down enough so that working with you,<br/>\nhelping you is a fun activity, not a stressful one.<br/>\n<br/>\nOccassionally, just do something weird.  Try different cuisine.  Get out a<br/>\ncraft book.  Play with helium.  See if you really can cook eggs on the<br/>\nsidewalk.  Get weird magazines, like Mother Earth News, that has all kinds<br/>\nof instructions on how to make stuff you would never have thought of making<br/>\nyourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome organizations are pretty unschooler friendly and can help offer a<br/>\nframework to someone who is used to having lots of imposed structure.  4-H<br/>\nhas been wonderful for our family.  The kids do projects of their own<br/>\nchoosing, finish them or not as they choose, and have a ball.  It has also<br/>\nsparked some long-term interests.
