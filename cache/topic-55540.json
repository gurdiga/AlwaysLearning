I stay at home with my children and I help them and I help my husband and I help my dog and I help my cats and we have a good life. Sometimes I write on a few lists about unschooling. Sometimes I write about marriage. Nobody pays me and I have no aspirations that I&#39;m helping other folks make money. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day David and I cooked a meal for a campload of people. The camp of people wanted to pay us for the food we made. We didn&#39;t want to be paid, it was a gift. Payment would have made it a service instead of a gift. Claire, your thanking me for my gift of my experience and my knowledge as it applies to your ability to make a living using it sullies it in a similar way. You&#39;ve turned me into a freebie resource for your livelihood. <br/>\n<br/>\nI imagine that a lot of people on this list use the gifts of knowledge and experience that are offered here in their day-to-day lives, beyond the parent-child interactions. I know that my actions beyond my family are informed by things that I have learned on this list. But I don&#39;t want to know that I am acting as a private researcher for someone who is leaving me unpaid. It&#39;s like when lots of grad student have their ideas and work stolen by their professors for a publication. It isn&#39;t sharing any more. It&#39;s freeloading, it&#39;s theft, it&#39;s something wrong. <br/>\n<br/>\nRecently there have been instances of news shows interviewing unschoolers about what they do, and those unschoolers have been edited to look amusing and nuts and a bit irresponsible. I recognize that what you are doing isn&#39;t to the same degree, but there is a level of you taking us for a ride for your own gain that is similar to these news shows. It doesn&#39;t make this list or these people bad to be nervous of someone who comes and preaches and takes and doesn&#39;t offer anything of value in return, not even honest curiousity. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo you aren&#39;t really welcome. It wasn&#39;t actually aimed at you. I&#39;m happy to do what I do when I do it. It&#39;s actually pretty easy to research stuff for your own self as Su skillfully demonstrated. I&#39;m just sometimes a bit of a show off. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Forwarded Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Claire Marketos &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:claire@...\">claire@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:s.waynforth@...\">s.waynforth@...</a><br/>\nSent: Wednesday, 30 June, 2010 17:08:53<br/>\nSubject: Thank you<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nThank you this is fascinating information and will be useful<br/>\nin my work.<br/>\n <br/>\nBest wishes<br/>\nClaire Marketos<br/>\nParenting/Educational Consultant<br/>\nwww.inspiredparenting.co.za  <br/>\n083 457 3667<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55449,"nextTopicId":55546}}
