They are usually happily doing something next to me OR<br/>\nasleep when I post OR engaged in something and don&#39;t need me at the<br/>\nmoment.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are pretty happy folks and they get along very well 98% of the<br/>\ntime. Sierra and Jalen are content to play games together, as are the<br/>\nolder boys and sometimes they&#39;re all together doing some game or art<br/>\nproject.<br/>\n<br/>\nI write fast, I talk fast, I think fast. I&#39;d probably be called<br/>\n&quot;hyper&quot; by some.:) I can live with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nTonight, I got home from work (dh was working on taxes while the kids<br/>\nplayed their own things) fed them, watched Sierra and Jalen battling<br/>\non a video game, chatted with the older boys, then sat down to read<br/>\nfor a bit. <br/>\nI spend about 15-20 minutes in the morning and maybe 1/2 hour at night<br/>\nonline. My time online is almost always interrupted, I just grab<br/>\nminutes here and there. Days off I can sometimes get a little more in,<br/>\nbut we&#39;re usually too busy hiking, or being with friends or creating<br/>\nart or something fun.  I can hear Jalen getting frustrated with the<br/>\ngame right now...so time to get off.  This post took me about 3<br/>\nminutes to write.
