It was probably<br/>\non the HSC list, but it may have been at a northern California HSC<br/>\nget-together we went to. Nope (checking archives for June 11 and 12 of<br/>\n2001),  it was on the list, and all of the official HCS people who posted<br/>\nagreed that each child needed to have a responsible adult with them at<br/>\neach workshop they attended.  In support of this, an example was given of<br/>\ntwo children who were dropped off and not picked up at the end of a<br/>\nworkshop. It was suggested that people (even people posting who had<br/>\nresponsible 9 and 11 year old kids) bring  a designated sitter to<br/>\naccompany he kids to workshops. No one said anything about your<br/>\nindividual child being responsible enough to do anything independently,<br/>\nunless they had hit the magic age of 13.

At that time she&#39;d already participated in<br/>\ntheater groups with teens, and was (and still is) passionate about All<br/>\nThings Theater, and a friend who was a teen was planning to go to that<br/>\nworkshop and they wanted to go together....<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sorry that I posted without thinking that some of the same people<br/>\nfrom that discussion were here (clearly I rarely look at names).

Been there; wasted my breath <br/>\nalready.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was the HSC Board member responsible for the Sacramento conference last <br/>\nyear.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been doing this for 11 years and have tried a number of different <br/>\napproaches. We now state officially that kids should be accompanied by a <br/>\nresponsible adult at all times. Then we leave it up to the responsible ADULTS <br/>\nto decide what that means in their own individual case. Some kids are fine on <br/>\ntheir own. Maybe with your kid, being somewhere in the hotel is enough <br/>\n&quot;accompaniment.&quot; Most of us with younger children have walked them to <br/>\nworkshops, seen them settled in, go to our own workshops, go back to pick <br/>\nthem up immediately at the end of their workshop. There is no problem with <br/>\nthis, especially if you mention which workshop you&#39;ll be in to one of the <br/>\nadults who IS staying around, just in case your child needs you, and also <br/>\nmake sure the child knows where to find you. If your child isn&#39;t capable of <br/>\nremembering where you said you&#39;d be, they probably ought not to be out and <br/>\nabout in the hotel all on their own. Most of us meet other parents there, <br/>\ntoo, and if we do have kids who need an adult to be closer, we trade off <br/>\nhanging around nearby. Or, if a kid wants to go to a workshop that is likely <br/>\nto be difficult for them on their own - say a 5 yo wants to go to a <br/>\nbookmaking workshop that is aimed more at 10 to 12 yo&#39;s - then an adult <br/>\nreally ought to go IN with them to be there to help their own child so that <br/>\nthe child isn&#39;t frustrated. The workshop presenters will always do their <br/>\nbest, but if they have a lot of kids, one young kid may not get the personal <br/>\nattention they might need unless they have their own adult with them. Again, <br/>\nparents have to use their judgement, but if there is a problem, we can always <br/>\nremind them that we already said THEY are responsible for their child.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I did my cooperative games workshop, I had a couple of young children <br/>\nthere - no adults in sight. They played for a while and then ran off. I was <br/>\nnot in a position to follow them and make sure they were okay - I was busy <br/>\nrunning a workshop. I don&#39;t know if that was okay with the parents - I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow if the parents told the kids to STAY in my workshop or if they told the <br/>\nkids they could just leave and go run around the hotel on their own - or what <br/>\nthey may have told the kids. BUT if the parents came to me and complained <br/>\nthat I&#39;d LET them run off on their own, I&#39;d have reminded them that it was <br/>\nTHEIR responsibility to keep track of them, not mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, because we say that kids must be accompanied by a responsible adult, it <br/>\ngives us the ability to deal with it easily when there is a real problem with <br/>\na truly disruptive kid by simply telling the parents that they must stay with <br/>\nthe child. <br/>\n<br/>\nNobody polices this. Nobody even WANTS every single kid to have an adult with <br/>\nthem - there isn&#39;t room in the workshop rooms. We hope it means there will be <br/>\nsome extra adults at all the kids workshops - so that the workshop presenter <br/>\nhas some help. Also, one adult can be responsible for a number of kids - even <br/>\nthe young kids don&#39;t have to have their own parent with them all the time.  <br/>\nThere are many opportunities to meet other parents and make trade <br/>\narrangements. And, although I&#39;ve heard the argument that you may not want to <br/>\nmake a &quot;stranger&quot; responsible for your child -- and I can understand that -- <br/>\nI fail to understand why you&#39;d think it was safer to let the child run around <br/>\nthe hotel all alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the cooperative games workshop last year I had a big group of kids with no <br/>\nother adults. One of the kids stepped on a bee and was stung on the bottom of <br/>\nher foot. I got lucky and the children&#39;s program coordinator just HAPPENED to <br/>\nwalk by right then and she took the girl to get treated.  Otherwise I&#39;d have <br/>\nhad to cancel the rest of the workshop to take care of her. We also hope that <br/>\nit means people will realize that they remain responsible for their own kids <br/>\n- we don&#39;t sign them in and out, we don&#39;t keep them in the room when the <br/>\nworkshop is over - waiting for their parents - we don&#39;t offer any kind of <br/>\nbabysitting service. We&#39;ve DONE that in the past - it hasn&#39;t worked out well <br/>\nat all. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe hotel is lots of buildings all spread out over a wide area - it is open <br/>\nto the public and you have to cross parking lots to get from one workshop to <br/>\nanother and there is a swimming pool and a big lake right in the middle of <br/>\neverything. The conference must be very clear that we are not taking <br/>\nresponsibility for the children. You might not realize what poor judgement <br/>\nsome people use. Last year someone sent a 2 year old to go around from one <br/>\nworkshop to another with an older sibling - an 11 yo. The older sibling got <br/>\ninterested in something and the 2 yo disappeared.  This is not at all a place <br/>\nthat is safe for a 2 yo to be wandering around on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids all go all over and to all the workshops totally on their own. My <br/>\nyoungest is now 11. When she was littler, I made sure someone walked her to <br/>\nand from each workshop - either myself or another adult. My kids are easy to <br/>\nget along with, comfortable asking someone for help if they need it, not <br/>\ndisruptive in a workshop or likely to be destructive to property or annoying <br/>\nto other conference attendees, and they are extremely sensible about parking <br/>\nlots, swimming pools, and lakes. They can go around on their own and I can be <br/>\nconfident that nobody is going to complain or have a problem with it. IF they <br/>\ndid - if my kids were causing problems - the conference coordinator would be <br/>\nable to tell me that I&#39;m supposed to make sure they are accompanied by a <br/>\nresponsible adult and that would be that. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the &quot;stupid ageist rules&quot; that she is talking about are that the TEENS <br/>\nhave some workshops - an opening and closing session - that are for teens <br/>\nonly. There are around 150 teens and the room can barely hold them all. Space <br/>\nis a major factor in many decisions - there is a need to try to spread <br/>\nattendees out among all the workshops going on at the same time and not have <br/>\nthem all try to crowd into just one or two of the workshops. For another, <br/>\nthey are doing very &quot;teen&quot; types of things in some of the teen workshops - <br/>\nthese aren&#39;t arts and crafts workshops - there are serious discussion <br/>\nsessions about teen experiences and feelings. Many workshops are open to kids <br/>\nof all ages - including teens, children, and adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe children&#39;s workshops have recommended ages - not because kids of other <br/>\nages are not allowed - any age kids are allowed at any children&#39;s workshop. <br/>\nThis information didn&#39;t used to be included in the conference program but was <br/>\nREQUESTED by conference attendees - so that they could have some idea of the <br/>\nage range the workshop was aimed at - to help the kids in deciding which <br/>\nworkshops they wanted to attend because there are so many to choose from and <br/>\nit is HARD to make those choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know Holly and she&#39;ll be just fine. <br/>\n<br/>\n--pamS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5411,"nextTopicId":5490}}
