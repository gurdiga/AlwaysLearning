My","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-155466617\">Hello Everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter hearing about this group in the last week from at least three different <br/>\npeople and their saying how great it is I decided to join. My name is Ginny <br/>\nHunt and we homeschool/unschool with our four children (Ryan 18, Jonathan 10, <br/>\nJosiah 8, and Victoria 5) in Virginia.  :::waves::::<br/>\n<br/>\nI just had to comment on the Candy Land thread because my daughter&#39;s birthday <br/>\nin December was themed &quot;A Unicorn in Candy Land&quot; -- ha! She had chosen some <br/>\nbirthday party plates that portrayed a magical rainbow and white unicorn amid <br/>\ncandy flowers and a gingerbread castle, so we ran with the Candy Land theme <br/>\nbecause we had an old game from when my oldest was a toddler in the mid <br/>\neighties. The graphics change over the years and my daughter was fascinated <br/>\nwith the different characters and how they differed from the ones she knew <br/>\ntoday.  Anyway, we had made a gingerbread house so we put the old game board <br/>\nin the center of the table and plopped the gingerbread house on top of it and <br/>\nset the little colored gingerbread men game pieces around it.  I made a <br/>\nunicorn shaped cake and served all kinds of fun foods like sparkly pink <br/>\nJell-o in plastic champagne glasses and pastel mini marshmallows in gold foil <br/>\ncups.  A day or so before the party I baked large gingerbread men that the <br/>\nkids decorated during the party.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo there&#39;s a better use for the game than actually playing it. Ha!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Ginny<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4885,"nextTopicId":4902}}
