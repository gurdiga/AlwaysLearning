I&#39;m a SAHM in <br/>\nAsheville, NC and decided to join your group a month ago, but we have <br/>\nbeen vacationing in Colorado. What a learning adventure! Driving <br/>\ncross-country with a toddler. Jacob had a great time (driving time <br/>\nincluded). I also heard about your group from my friend, Pam Tiger.<br/>\nI don&#39;t know why she thinks she doesn&#39;t know anyone home/unschooling.<br/>\nWe were both part of a homeschool playgroup for all ages. I have <br/>\ngiven her LOTS of info on unschooling (I have always known I was <br/>\ngoing homeschool, unschool ray of light came while I was pregnant). <br/>\nI am also part of a HOME group here and a Waldorf-insipred handwork <br/>\ngroup. Thanks to you Sandra for your advocating unschooling. My family<br/>\nhave heard info from some of your articles and Unschooling Hdbk <br/>\nto &quot;explain&quot; unschooling. Waiting for my unschooling bumpersticker <br/>\nfrom Home-Ed discussion board (Anne Ohman). Let me know if you would <br/>\nlike one; she is asking $3. Hope to be able to go to conference.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings on your journey,<br/>\nJennifer Miller</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":29913543,"authorName":"Kate Green","from":"Kate Green &lt;karegree@...&gt;","profile":"greenuae","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"intro","postDate":"1016194024","msgId":5536,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMuMC42LjMyLjIwMDIwMzE1MTYwNzA0LjAwODMzZWIwQGVtaXJhdGVzLm5ldC5hZT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":16038,"prevInTime":5535,"nextInTime":5537,"topicId":5536,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I m Kate and I currently live in Abu Dhabi which is in the United Arab Emirates (everyone used to have to look this place up until recently!)

It<br/>\nis next to Saudi but actually very liberal and life is not that much<br/>\ndifferent from the west. I&#39;m originally from England and my husband is from<br/>\nLouisiana.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have 3 boys aged 14, 12, and 7. My husband is currently a SAHD and I am<br/>\na developmental child pscyhologist. I am a professor at an Arab women&#39;s<br/>\nuniversity here and involved in setting up the child development program<br/>\nand doing lots of research on Bedouin families.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have homeschooled/unschooled/learnt at home/played since we decided<br/>\nformal schooling wasn&#39;t for us after our oldest son tried kindergarten 9<br/>\nyears ago. I usually tell people we unschool as that title seems to define<br/>\nus as well as any. We have been thru various levels of our own development<br/>\nwithin this process and so at times have been more &quot;schooly&quot; than others.<br/>\nCurrently we have journals in which I help the boys to define their weekly<br/>\ngoals and then they work independantly to accomplish those. <br/>\n<br/>\nDh, Mark, has been more nervous about our lack of formal sit-down work than<br/>\nI have been but since he has been home fulltime for the last 2 years has<br/>\nreally come around. Our youngest wanted to read last year so they worked<br/>\nthru &quot;Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Lessons&quot; and now Ben is reading very<br/>\nwell. His dad is really feeling great about the whole thing which is nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther things about us: We attachment parent (also another research area of<br/>\nmine:) I&#39;m vegetarian, we like to travel, love animals, the boys are into<br/>\nskateboarding, playing guitars, soccer, and karate and dh is into rocks<br/>\n(he&#39;s a geologist).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnything else anyone wants to know just ask:)<br/>\n<br/>\nKate</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39512,"nextTopicId":39497}}
