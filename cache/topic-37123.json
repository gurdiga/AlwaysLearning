(she looked 14 at the time).<br/>\nIt&#39;s one thing to lie about an age to get a discount (movies, museums) which I will NOT do, but it&#39;s another when the age restriction is arbitrary.<br/>\nJay <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37071,"nextTopicId":37121}}
