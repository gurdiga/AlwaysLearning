After playing with this particular friend my daughter is so much more reactive and sensitive to us in the house. It is like after playing with the friend, dd wants to start a fight with someone here in the house just to get out her frustration. Also, her self-esteem dies when she is around the friend too much, especially as the friend likes to point out dd&#39;s phonetic spelling and laugh about it. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Should I put my foot down about playing with this friend (even  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; though it totally goes against my grain)? The whole situation is  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; upsetting not just to my daughter, but to the whole family. Are  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; there any better conversations I can try with my daughter?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How about doing more things in the afternoon without this friend? Less  <br/>\n&gt; talk, more action &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been trying to figure that out. Most afternoons we are home because ds3 still takes a nap. It is hard to keep her home when all the kids in the neighborhood are home from school and out playing. We generally have activities most evenings, but there is a 2-hour window between school letting out and us going out. And, of course as of today it is summer. I can put my foot down and insist she stays home, but I&#39;m trying to overcome my controlling tendencies ;-). Playing with friends is extremely important to dd - given a choice she will always choose to play or hang out with someone else (I&#39;m really trying hard to be okay with that). <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Robin B.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks for the input.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":187853867,"authorName":"aldq75","from":"&quot;aldq75&quot; &lt;aldq75@...&gt;","profile":"aldq75","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Hurtful Friendship","postDate":"1276194791","msgId":54842,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGh1cmI1NytoMGxlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PERBMEYyNjNDLTc3MTMtNDY5Qy04Q0ZELTQyRTBDQ0RDOTUzNkBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":54841,"nextInTopic":54843,"prevInTime":54841,"nextInTime":54843,"topicId":54828,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"How about doing more things in the afternoon without this friend?

Maybe the girls spending less time together will help find a good balance for your daughter and the entire family. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do think there are occasionally times when we need to step in. With my own kids, sometimes a well-timed interruption gets them to ask for help in solving a problem.

They live here in the neighborhood and spend most every afternoon together. Overtime both the girls have become more and more hurtful (words) towards each other. I never realized how much of an affect this friendship had on all of us in the family until the friend moved away for six months earlier this year to live with the non-custodial parent. During those six months I watched my daughter absolutely bloom and a lot of her temper and crying jags disappeared.
