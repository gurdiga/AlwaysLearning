Is she public schooled and needing to unwind from<br/>\nschool?  Does she get any exercise?  There are a million unknowns in this<br/>\nexample.  Does she really even have ADD?  How many children are actually<br/>\nmedically diagnosed with ADD?  From what I&#39;ve heard most are just medicated<br/>\nbased on a report of not concentrating (on boring repetitive busy work) or<br/>\nhyperactivity.

One doctor Phil episode had a toddler who<br/>\njust sat there all day, supposedly, and freaked out when the TV was turned<br/>\noff.  Where were the parents? What were they thinking?  Why didn&#39;t they<br/>\ninteract with their child?  My kids have free rein on TV.  But we spend most<br/>\nof the day doing other things.  We do watch TV and generally we watch it<br/>\ntogether in the evening and we like TV.  But we also play games, ride our<br/>\nhorse, go outside, visit friends, read books together, cook, eat, play, and<br/>\non and on.  I don&#39;t spend the whole day ignoring my children and they don&#39;t<br/>\nspend the whole day watching TV. Why would they choose that over all the<br/>\nother options?  TV is great sometimes, but life is way more interesting most<br/>\nof the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;.

Look, even though she had a childhood<br/>\nof free rein on sweets, she, as an adult, has chosen to eat healthy foods.<br/>\nHow could that happen?  Does she think that there won&#39;t be any consequences<br/>\nfor her children coming from a home where sweets were off limits?  Maybe<br/>\nthey will spend their adulthoods binging on the things that were restricted.<br/>\nIt&#39;s certainly possible.  Wouldn&#39;t she rather they learn to follow their own<br/>\nbody signals even when exposed to sweets?  My kids, who have been given free<br/>\nrein on foods, are much better at choosing a wide variety of foods to meet<br/>\ntheir needs than I am.  They stop with one or two cookies and might even<br/>\nfollow it with carrot sticks.  I eat half the batch and have to force myself<br/>\nto eat vegetables.

There are things I have to say, and I&#39;ve<br/>\nforwarded on Pam&#39;s great post on the economics of limiting tv (with her<br/>\npermission), but I want to write a well thought out post because there are<br/>\nalso many on this list that like what I&#39;m doing with my kids and want to<br/>\nlearn more. I want those who might be led to an unschooling lifestyle to get<br/>\na good representation, does this make sense? I don&#39;t want it left with the<br/>\nfeeling that I&#39;ve chosen total unruliness for my kids.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou asked so I will answer. Post just the links once, and then step away.<br/>\nTry to lose any attachment to the idea of converting or even leading people<br/>\nto Unschooling. (You can lead a horse to water......)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy experience with this type of issue, both in person with my local group<br/>\n(few Unschoolers - mostly relaxed and eclectic) and on line with the<br/>\nnon-unschoolers, is to not get involved with this type of discussion, other<br/>\nthan to very briefly answer questions about my own practices without the<br/>\nwhy&#39;s, or simply say, &quot;We are Unschoolers and we don&#39;t have food<br/>\nrestrictions&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nI allow Jayn&#39;s actions to speak for themselves most of the time, and do a<br/>\nlot of shrugging when people are trying enthusiastically to encourage me to<br/>\nadopt some schoolish activity/trick/program that they have used with great<br/>\n&quot;success&quot;. To be honest I usually even avoid sharing Jayn&#39;s achievements<br/>\nwith these non-unschooling folk because if I ever have, the immediate result<br/>\nhas been lengthy proselytizing about the next step *I* should take to<br/>\n*ensure* that she briskly moves on to the next level of reading or writing<br/>\nor whatever the skill may be. (I don&#39;t like the proselytizing; nor do they.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is for my own peace of mind and emotional sanity. On the rare occasions<br/>\nthat I have gotten into any type of &quot;defending Unschooling&quot; discussion I<br/>\nhave ended up losing sleep from stress and worry about the poor little kid<br/>\nbeing forced to write 3 sentences a day. I don&#39;t do school-bashing<br/>\nconversations either, because it makes me crazy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your friends are attracted to Unschooling, they *will* ask you, probably<br/>\nprivately, for information about it. These are the questions that I answer<br/>\nin much more detail, focusing again on what we do every day, directing them<br/>\nto all our favorite websites and books for more &quot;theoretical&quot; readings. Jayn<br/>\nis in front of them, the picture of health, energy and curiosity so clearly<br/>\nis in no trouble over tv or food. I love watching the jaws drop when she<br/>\nsays no to a chocolate. ;) Your joyful family will be the best advertisement<br/>\nfor the lifestyle also. <br/>\n<br/>\nMost local lists are not the kind of rigorous discussion lists that this and<br/>\nthe other R/U lists are. I have to remind myself to check the subject line<br/>\nand make sure I am not about to slam someone on my local list.  - &quot;What is<br/>\nthe best early reading program? Ds is almost three and doesn&#39;t know his<br/>\nalphabet yet.&quot; :P~~~~~~ <br/>\n<br/>\nThe refreshing nature of being on an R/U list, the delight and wonder of<br/>\nfinding this brilliant, sparkling lifestyle is hard not to want to share<br/>\nwith all. However I have found that many people become defensive instantly<br/>\n(even on these lists sometimes) because the truth is that Unschooling proves<br/>\nthat almost every thing they feel compelled to do, or control with their<br/>\nchildren and their children&#39;s education, is utterly unnecessary. In some<br/>\ncases this is tantamount to saying, &quot;Your whole life today is a waste of<br/>\nenergy&quot; if they are deeply committed to Home Schooling and all the<br/>\ntrappings. Trying to force people to hear this before they are ready is more<br/>\nheart wrenching for me than knowing that the kid has to study about the<br/>\nrainforest this month regardless of interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I should add that I do speak up on those rare occasions when someone is<br/>\ntalking about punishments (&quot;consequences&quot;) for whatever reason, with the<br/>\ninformation that we never punish Jayn. Luckily there are no apparent<br/>\nspankers in our group - certainly that has never come up.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Is she public schooled and needing to unwind from<br/>\nschool?  Does she get any exercise?  There are a million unknowns in this<br/>\nexample.  Does she really even have ADD?  How many children are actually<br/>\nmedically diagnosed with ADD?  From what I&#39;ve heard most are just medicated<br/>\nbased on a report of not concentrating (on boring repetitive busy work) or<br/>\nhyperactivity. (it&#39;s not normal for children to sit at a desk all day.)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; As many people say &quot;you can just see it&quot;.

One doctor Phil episode had a toddler who<br/>\njust sat there all day, supposedly, and freaked out when the TV was turned<br/>\noff.  Where were the parents? What were they thinking?  Why didn&#39;t they<br/>\ninteract with their child?  My kids have free rein on TV.  But we spend most<br/>\nof the day doing other things.  We do watch TV and generally we watch it<br/>\ntogether in the evening and we like TV.  But we also play games, ride our<br/>\nhorse, go outside, visit friends, read books together, cook, eat, play, and<br/>\non and on.  I don&#39;t spend the whole day ignoring my children and they don&#39;t<br/>\nspend the whole day watching TV. Why would they choose that over all the<br/>\nother options?  TV is great sometimes, but life is way more interesting most<br/>\nof the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;.

Look, even though she had a childhood<br/>\nof free rein on sweets, she, as an adult, has chosen to eat healthy foods.<br/>\nHow could that happen?  Does she think that there won&#39;t be any consequences<br/>\nfor her children coming from a home where sweets were off limits?  Maybe<br/>\nthey will spend their adulthoods binging on the things that were restricted.<br/>\nIt&#39;s certainly possible.  Wouldn&#39;t she rather they learn to follow their own<br/>\nbody signals even when exposed to sweets?  My kids, who have been given free<br/>\nrein on foods, are much better at choosing a wide variety of foods to meet<br/>\ntheir needs than I am.  They stop with one or two cookies and might even<br/>\nfollow it with carrot sticks.  I eat half the batch and have to force myself<br/>\nto eat vegetables.

A little background on me....I have 5 kids (7,5,3,23 months and almost 3 months). When my oldest was around 3 I found a local community of Waldorf homeschoolers and I thought I&#39;d found the non-mainstream life I was looking for. All I knew at the time was I didn&#39;t like much of the way I was raised and was looking for something different. So, I spent 3 yrs living that lifestyle and then when my oldest was about 6 I started to realize that many of the choices I was making was just because they were &quot;Waldorfy&quot; choices and was not really being led by my kids or myself. So, I started to soul search and came across unschooling and non coersive parenting, and started my deschooling process. I&#39;ve read this, and other lists, for about a year now and our family has made pretty drastic changes with wonderful results.<br/>\n <br/>\nNow, my friends are beginning to ask me about these choices and we have a thread going on our local moms list about letting go of control and food issues came up. When I mom said that sugar is to kids what drugs are to teens I had to respond and posted a thought out response  with links to Sandra&#39;s website as well as some email from Pam and Sandra (with their permission). I got fairly blasted and I could use some help articulating into words some of these concepts. I work from a feeling level and, being fairly new to living like this myself, feel like I could use some back up before I write my response. So, here&#39;s some of what I got back..<br/>\n     *******************************************************************************<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;While I am completely in support of children&#39;s choices & freedoms, I also think their are limits to those acceptable choices. I have come to the conclusion that this is based on what is right for each family based on beliefs, habits, etc. What works for me wouldnt work for a parent who eats sweets or watches tv, they could not take those choices away from their children (they could, but it wouldnt work very well).  For me, sugar is completely unnecesary on a day to day basis & I believe it to be quite harmful. I think it plays a major role in our modern epidemic of chronic illness. I therefore, refuse to spend our hard earned money on something like that (except on occasions). However, they still get a great deal of choices. If they want yogurt (plain of course!) for lunch instead of the meal, ok. If they choose to eat at 2 instead of 12, so be it. They frequently peruse the garden while outside and feast on so much veggies & herbs that they do not eat the snacks I prepare for<br/>\n </span></blockquote> them. Great.  When they want a beverage, they choose from various fermented, yummy beverages I make - kombucha, water kefir, milk kefir, ginger beer (its not really alcoholic!). <br/>\n <br/>\nI think trying to give complete freedom of choices is like saying when they are teenagers I should spend my money on cigarretes and alcohol & tell them to just make wise choices. They are children & are not fully capable of making all of their own choices, which is why there is an adult to help them. <br/>\n <br/>\nOver Christmas my FIL (a very &quot;mainstream&quot; kinda guy) actually shared with us that he supports what we are doing b/c he believes 100% that endless hours of video games and a very high sugar diet (fruity pebbles for breakfast, countless Mountain Dew, and candy) caused Brian&#39;s epilepsy. Upon our return home, my mother was giving me grief, as usual, and my father butted in that he also agrees fully as he thinks my nieces add are directly related to how much tv she watches. As many people say &quot;you can just see it&quot;. Even the AAP came out with a statement against any tv viewing for children under 2 because it has been proven to cause structural changes in the brain during a crucial development time. <br/>\n <br/>\nI write this not to persuade anyone, just to explain why I think the same & yet differently. <br/>\n <br/>\nAnother reason I believe we see things as we do comes from the way we ourselves were raised. It seems each generation sways to the other side of how they were raised, or is that just my perception? I was raised in a very free home. I was given free reign over endless candy, sodas, home baked sweets and tv/ video games. As a teenager I was given lots of money & a car & a &quot;curfew&quot; which was never enforced. They cared, dont get me wrong, they just had a very misguided or misplaced I suppose, trust. It took years of illness, fatigue & various health problems before I changed my diet and feel awesome. It took alot of work for me to maintain any form of self-discipline, I am very used to doing what I want, when I want & not realizing any consequences. Brian is too, so I suppose we both relate to that in the same way. <br/>\n <br/>\nPerhaps we also have an addictive personality disorder within my family ;) When we had tv, my children wanted to watch it every waking minute. If I said no, it was an all day fight. Our lives revolved around whether or not they could watch tv. Since its been gone, they have never once asked or questioned. Its just no longer an option. They watch it at friends houses and grandparents, etc. They, for the first time, disappear for hours on end in their rooms or outside - my daughter even gets boxes & junk to set up little playscapes with her dolls and animals. These things never happened before. For us, these are the right decisions because of it. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n******************************************************************************************************<br/>\n <br/>\nHow might you respond to this? There are things I have to say, and I&#39;ve forwarded on Pam&#39;s great post on the economics of limiting tv (with her permission), but I want to write a well thought out post because there are also many on this list that like what I&#39;m doing with my kids and want to learn more. I want those who might be led to an unschooling lifestyle to get a good representation, does this make sense? I don&#39;t want it left with the feeling that I&#39;ve chosen total unruliness for my kids. Granted, with 5 kids, our house often feels like a 3 ring circus, but it&#39;s happy and joyful and it&#39;s working for us. <br/>\n <br/>\nAnyhow...off to change babies diapers....if anyone has the time to give me a few thougts that I might want to consider before writing my response I would be SO appreciative. I&#39;m not trying to change anybody&#39;s minds here, it&#39;s not an unschooling list, but want the ideas to be well represented with what I have to say. <br/>\nThank you so much,<br/>\nKristina<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163750020,"authorName":"tuckervill2@aol.com","from":"tuckervill2@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: More about television","postDate":"1106055599","msgId":21607,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ2LjYxMThjODA2LjJmMWU2YmFmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":21604,"nextInTopic":21675,"prevInTime":21606,"nextInTime":21608,"topicId":21570,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/17/2005 10:48:52 PM Central Standard Time, heasue2003@yahoo.com writes: I am a  sensitive person.

I don&#39;t mean this to be a slam against you -- many of us were in that place at one time.  I know I was.  As I read more of your words, I totally saw myself from about 15 months ago.  I also felt I was doing a great job in having child-led learning -- and while I wasn&#39;t doing a bad job, I was still a ways off in truly understanding what unschooling is.  I thought I knew...but I didn&#39;t know.  I joined an unschooling discussion list (not this one) and found myself argumentative with the members.  I was determined to stand tall against the members who disagreed with me that we were not really unschooling -- I wanted them to see that not every unschooling family had to be the way they shared.  I became very frustrated and even angry when members would point out that my views didn&#39;t seem to &quot;fit&quot; with their definitions.  I said almost every single thing you said in your posts.  Within a short<br/>\n time, I unsubscribed, never thinking that I would join again.<br/>\n <br/>\nI continued on, and eventually, I REALLY got unschooling.  I really, really wanted to learn more about this way of life, so I gradually embraced much of ideas about unschooling.  I continued to read at unschooling.com on a regular basis.  I checked out the Unschooling Handbook from the library.  I would read unschooling articles on various websites.  In my case, I did see it -- finally.  I imagine there are others who get upset on unschooling lists who never do &quot;get unschooling&quot;, but I imagine that they never really wanted to understand it.  I did.  And after I left the list, I would often think back to things that Sandra Dodd and others wrote.  I never thought that those things I disagreed with, would be something I would feel so strongly about that I now even write this response to you!  <br/>\n <br/>\nToday, I am a member of that same list I left many months ago.  I rejoined...a little apprehensive at first because I left so frustrated with those there!  But I rejoined and, as the list guidelines say, I read for 2 weeks before writing in.  During the two weeks, I realized that WOW! I honestly agree with the things that are posted here!<br/>\n <br/>\nThis is not to say that I agree with absolutely everything posted on this list or any of the other unschooling lists -- we all have our differences, but when it comes to truly unschooling, you will find that many of us have a lot in common.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI hope you don&#39;t take my post as an attack -- and I do realize that you may be (probably are) very different than me.  I just wanted to share my story, since much of what you write sounded like me months ago.

I <br/>\ndon&#39;t *teach* the basic subjects like Math, Science, History and so <br/>\nforth.  I do however spend a few minutes about two or three days a <br/>\nweek working with my daughter out of a Spanish workbook.  She enjoys <br/>\nit.  If she hated it I would stop.  Just recently I have decided to <br/>\ntry a few new things to occupy our minds during these long winter <br/>\nmonths.  A hero a week, where I search out someone who I feel would <br/>\ninterest my daughter.  We learn a little about that person.

I often feel that my children watch television <br/>\nwhen they are bored.

When my son our daughter ask to watch television I <br/>\ntry to come up with something fun for us to do together.  Dance, <br/>\ncolor, make cookies, read, etc.  They don&#39;t want to watch television <br/>\nas much when we have fun things to do.
