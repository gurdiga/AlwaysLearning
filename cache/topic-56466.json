Other  <br/>\ngirls, especially, took it as an insult, and sometimes it did come  <br/>\nacross that way, because if someone asked her for something or to do  <br/>\nsomething she would first &quot;tsk&quot; and then say &quot;okay,&quot; which made it  <br/>\nsound like &quot;OH BROTHER, okay, whatever&quot; to people who didn&#39;t know  <br/>\nher.
