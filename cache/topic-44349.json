Think &quot;the Dharma Initiative&quot; and their training cages and  <br/>\nbuttons to push.  (or if you never watch Lost, never mind that part)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe VIDEO 2 Using Effective Consequences<br/>\nThe description is &quot;Gives parents and arsenal of effective  <br/>\nconsequences they can use in practically any situation.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;ARSENAL&quot;?  I do understand the use of simile, but arsenal is a very  <br/>\nfirepower-heavy word.  VERY antagonistic.  And people have arsenals in  <br/>\ntheir own defense.   So to use that word, it seems he sees teens as  <br/>\nenemies, to some extent.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still listening to the preview file of &quot;Using Effective  <br/>\nConsequences&quot; and it&#39;s irritating me in a very specific way:  The guy  <br/>\nis reading aloud, and not reading very well.   He&#39;s pronouncing &quot;a&quot;  <br/>\nwith a long &quot;a&quot; so that it sounds like a kid reading in school rather  <br/>\nthan an adult with a PhD imparting important information.   He reads  <br/>\nas though he&#39;s reading this for the first time, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the content is interesting too.  Some quotes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Rules are only effective when there are consequences to enforce them.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow different that is from making choices.   The rule isn&#39;t that Keith  <br/>\ngoes to work and I stay home.  Keith went to work this morning because  <br/>\nhe would rather go to work than lose his job.

But I WANT to be here.  I like it here!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis guy who wants me to put a link to his site on my parenting  <br/>\npeacefull page says &quot;Without rules and consequences the family cannot  <br/>\nproperly function.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Properly function&quot;?<br/>\nThat&#39;s so different from &quot;live joyfully.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Home Contracts have been used for years to effectuate change in teens.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s from Video 4&#39;s description.   I hate words like &quot;effectuate.&quot;   <br/>\nThey&#39;re bullshit.   But who wants to buy videos or personal coaching  <br/>\nfrom someone who doesn&#39;t know big words they don&#39;t understand?<br/>\n<br/>\nVideo 5 promises help about this:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Recognizing specific warning signs is essential to being an effective  <br/>\nparent.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI bet nothing in there will suggest that parents might have done  <br/>\ndifferently long before the kids were teens, unless it&#39;s to shame the  <br/>\nparents for not having had stronger consequences years earlier.   And  <br/>\nI suppose this guy could say &quot;Well my daughter never wrestled in  <br/>\npudding.&quot;   In the warning signs, in the one minute they give away,   <br/>\nOne of the sections is the effect of parents.   They seem to be seeing  <br/>\nthe kids as a total liability to parental peace and prosperity or  <br/>\nsomething.<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably they do well with selling their assistance to families who&#39;ve  <br/>\nbotched the job and just want to make it through the last few years of  <br/>\nthe teen years before they can cut them off at 18.  It&#39;s as though  <br/>\nthey&#39;re raising wild mongooses and javelinas they don&#39;t recognize and  <br/>\nthey want an arsenal of tools to control them until they can release  <br/>\nthem into society at 18 or 21.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone here who wants a glimpse of an extremely different view of  <br/>\nteens might look at some of those little samples of the videos they&#39;re  <br/>\nSELLING that lead up to suggesting kids can be put in &quot;structured  <br/>\nschools&quot; (detainment centers) or boot camps.  And if the families  <br/>\ncan&#39;t afford the low monthly payments, they can be offset by community  <br/>\noutreach (which I figure means they&#39;ll be out drumming up more  <br/>\nbusiness for the lock-up programs.   It&#39;s kinda horrible.
