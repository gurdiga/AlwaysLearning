A big issue is <br/>\ntrust...the bottom line is that you have to trust (your child? the universe?) <br/>\nthat your kid WILL learn, left to his or her own whims. You also have to <br/>\ntrust that that learning will help them have good lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people trust their kids, for the most part, but are afraid in some <br/>\ncases. I think about an unnamed person who worries that some of her kids have <br/>\ntoo many &quot;issues&quot; or disabilities to be trusted. These people mean well, but <br/>\nthe fear gets in their way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would never suggest unschooling, or even homeschooling to my sister. She <br/>\nadores her kids, and is VERY involved in my nephew&#39;s school and advocates for <br/>\nhim passionately. If they were home, though, she&#39;d drive him nuts (and <br/>\nvice-versa). She worries too much, and she could never let go enough. <br/>\nEveryone would be in tears regularly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think most, if not all kids can probably unschool (unless they&#39;ve been to <br/>\ndamaged in the curiosity department, maybe?), but that there aren&#39;t that many <br/>\nparents who can. And lots of those parents REALLY want to be able to, or <br/>\nthere wouldn&#39;t be all those people SAYING they do unschool, when they clearly <br/>\ndon&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, the real question is...how do we figure out who can/should unschool? I <br/>\nrecently talked to a beginning homeschooler who wanted to know what to do. I <br/>\nsuggested he read around at Unschooling.com. I said he&#39;d likely have one of <br/>\ntwo reactions: &quot;This could never work. My kid would never do anything!&quot; or <br/>\n&quot;This is really exciting! I wish I could have done this!&quot; (He turned out to <br/>\nbe an unschooler.)  I suppose you could also get the &quot;This sounds cool, but <br/>\nyou have to TEACH math.&quot; (Maybe that&#39;s the eclectic homeschooler?)<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe we need one of those personality quizzes to determine what kind of <br/>\nHomeschooler you are?<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6463,"nextTopicId":6470}}
