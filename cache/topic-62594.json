It&#39;s been there a while, but they&#39;ve started making the links work, and they&#39;re always bringing more pages in.  Ren Allen had noted a while back that some of the TV discussions from the long-deleted messages boards at unschooling.com are surfacing.  This morning I found that &quot;Conversations with Sandra Dodd&quot; has popped back up, too, and many of the links work.  Not all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is from ten years ago; I cleaned up a couple of bits, but the link is below for anyone who wants to poke around &quot;in the old days.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBy Sandra Lynn Dodd (Sandradodd) on Tuesday, August 14, 2001 - 10:33 am:<br/>\n-=-On the other hand, if I didn&#39;t limit it they&#39;d <br/>\nalso fill up on Nick at Night reruns, those weirdo <br/>\ncartoons they have on now (what&#39;s with Cow and <br/>\nChicken ANYWAY??), MTV and the usual.-=- <br/>\n<br/>\nThey would fill up and be done. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you limit it, they will want more. <br/>\nIf you &quot;unlimit&quot; it they will fill up and be done. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey can only make their own choices if they&#39;re <br/>\nallowed to make their own choices. <br/>\n<br/>\n[I don&#39;t know who was being quoted in this next bit:]<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I bet your kids would too, eventually. And then <br/>\nthey&#39;d be REALLY reading because they wanted to, <br/>\nnot because it was the best thing left after the <br/>\nTV was restricted. If in the back of their mind <br/>\nthey&#39;re thinking &quot;I&#39;d rather be watching TV,&quot; the <br/>\nreading won&#39;t be as intense or chosen. -=- <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many families here who can show you kids <br/>\nwho don&#39;t turn the TV on much at all, but it&#39;s <br/>\nbecause they are allowed to turn it on as much as <br/>\nthey want to. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think balance will come from limitations <br/>\nas well as some people wish it would. <br/>\n<br/>\nI had a niece not allowed to eat sugar at all. <br/>\nNOTHING with sugar. A little hippie kid in the <br/>\nlate 1960&#39;s, early 1970&#39;s. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe came to stay with us for a few days when she <br/>\nwas six. We were keeping to her mom&#39;s rules about <br/>\nsugar. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe found her in the field, squatted over a 5 lb. <br/>\nbag of sugar, eating it with both hands like a <br/>\nmonkey, as fast as she could before she&#39;d get <br/>\ncaught. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat wasn&#39;t balance. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr maybe it was. It was the balance of all her <br/>\ndeprivation. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have come to their own balance with food, <br/>\nTV, activities, sleep, because they&#39;re allowed to <br/>\nmake their own choices. <br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20020425045838/http://www.unschooling.com/discus/messages/401/3687.html?WednesdaySeptember1220011059am\">http://web.archive.org/web/20020425045838/http://www.unschooling.com/discus/messages/401/3687.html?WednesdaySeptember1220011059am</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62572,"nextTopicId":62608}}
