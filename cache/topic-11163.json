I think it&#39;s my responsibility<br/>\nthough to discuss this with my kids beforehand and then to set limits on<br/>\ntheir behavior once there. If the place is not a wrestling or running<br/>\nenvironment then it is my duty as their parent to help them to restrain<br/>\nthemselves.

Now, I&#39;m working on the idea that Riley needs a<br/>\nbit of help handling his dissapointments. If he was not so bugged by the<br/>\nsituation, I would not be. He has shed gallons of tears about this party<br/>\nsituation over the past 4 years. He hurts, will always have a scar. Tim<br/>\nbelieves he should stay away because he does get his feelings hurt somehow. He<br/>\nis high energy. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis year I asked if all the family was invited, meaning I would come too. It<br/>\nwas a dance party. Riley is a dancing guy. He would have been fine from my<br/>\nperspective and I was not asking to drop my kiddoes off. I too wanted to<br/>\ncelebrate and be with my older child, but...opted to stay home with my younger<br/>\n2 and hubby, as we clearly were not wanted. We do feel this family doesn&#39;t<br/>\nlike Riley. They think we should spank him into line and not let him cry. He&#39;s<br/>\nloud. This family had only 1 child until last year. They now have 3, blessed<br/>\nwith twin daughters.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo back to my dilemna. When Riley doesn&#39;t get what he wants, like going to the<br/>\nparty, his intensity about the situation is unbelievable. The yelling,<br/>\nscreaming, swearing, pounding of fists. For example, yesterday at a group<br/>\nactivity we were going to play a version of go fish. It&#39;s a unit study group<br/>\nwho are raising Salmon. We were going to match lifecycle with habitat. Riley<br/>\ndid not like this idea. I suggested he go play while we played the game and<br/>\nsaid I would play the way he wanted to after. He did not like this. He likes<br/>\nhis way first always. He punched me in the stomach 2 times. So again, he<br/>\ndidn&#39;t get his way so he lashed out. He then did go sit outside, alone, cooled<br/>\noff, and came in to watch. I thanked him for taking himself outside and told<br/>\nhim in private my stomach hurt and I do not like to be punched.

Do I have a friend or just<br/>\na friendly neighbor? I have a sister-in-law who leaves people out constantly.<br/>\nDo these people know how much sadness occurs on the other end. I know not<br/>\neveryone can go to every party. I do not complain when someone invites one<br/>\nchild to something. This situation is different. The party was physically<br/>\nacross the street. All the kids on the block talked about it for over a wek.<br/>\nEach time the party was brought up my passionate son screams how unfair it is<br/>\nthat every else gets to go but him. He screams how much he hates the mom and<br/>\nthe girl. He plans how to hurt them back. Well when I have my party...4 years<br/>\nnow this has happened. I have expressed to my neighbor how hurt Riley feels.<br/>\nShe has seen him cry. Last year she promised Riley(then 4) something, forgot,<br/>\nthen gave him 2 pixie sticks. He cried cuz all the party people had 3. She<br/>\ntold him to say thank you, stop crying and be thankful for getting something<br/>\nat all. Some people do not feel for kids. Isn&#39;t that what makes us different<br/>\nthan main stream. We know kids are people too. We respect them. When they hurt<br/>\nwe listen. So I was reflecting Sandra. She origainally said yup, some people<br/>\ndo suck, I took this to mean, some people are cold, unfeeling people who can<br/>\nhurt others with their actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you Dar, I too had a similar idea. To put the situation in perspective.<br/>\nTo invite a portion of a family based on age or interest. Well, I need to go.<br/>\nI&#39;m sure my neighbor and I will talk again, but I&#39;m not sure how much I&#39;m<br/>\ngoing to give to the friendship anymore.

I&#39;ve picked her up from school, we<br/>\nswap baby sitting at times. For the past few years these birthday parties have<br/>\nbeen &quot;girl&quot; parties, so naturally Riley was left out. He throws major fits<br/>\nabout this, says all kinds of rude things, which are kinda true, and basically<br/>\nI have a long bad day trying to help him cope with being left out. The party<br/>\nis tommorrow. Again my oldest has been invited. Now my 3 too is chimming in I<br/>\nwant to go too. So I called and asked if it was a family  party where all of<br/>\nus can come celebrate Cassie&#39;s B-day. I was told it is just for the older<br/>\nones.  3 other friends from the block are invited, as well as 2 other boys my<br/>\nson plays great with, one the party girls 7 year old cousin.So it&#39;s not a<br/>\ngirls only party this year. I have such a hard time with arbitrary age cut<br/>\noff. Now this year Riley 6 can not go because he is not old enough. The party<br/>\nis right across the street. Many aunts, uncles, other important grown-ups will<br/>\nbe there. Two things I&#39;m asking about. How to comfort my kids when faced with<br/>\nbeing left out? And how to politely let my friend know that inviting 1 of my<br/>\nkids is torture and it&#39;s either all of us or none of us. I have played her<br/>\ngame now 3 times and I&#39;m fed up with her excuses. Riley will remember not<br/>\nbeing invited and flip out again and again in June in September. He is<br/>\npassionate. So I left the phone with my neighbor saying no I don&#39;t think we<br/>\nwant all the kids over, but I&#39;ll ask Cassie, it&#39;s her party.
