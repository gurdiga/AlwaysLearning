Even with<br/>\nadding up the money, or dice etc. they ask a lot of questions about the<br/>\ninstructions. It could just be a different situation for your daughter and<br/>\nit caused her to draw a blank or caught her off guard. BTW my boys are 12<br/>\nand 14.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;oth my children have areas that I am sure others would be very<br/>\n </span></blockquote>surprised that they didn&#39;t &quot;know&quot;**, given their ages, and at 13 and 10 yrs<br/>\nold they are both well into school age believe me. One example recently<br/>\nthat made me think of this whole thread, is dd (13) was struggling to play<br/>\nMonoploy at Girl Guides as she has never added columns of numbers on paper,<br/>\nand couldn&#39;t do the mental math in her head to pay people or buy things,<br/>\nalthough I know in real life she has done so with allowance and rounding it<br/>\nup in her head/estimating change, or &quot;candy money&quot; in much smaller amounts<br/>\nunder 10.00, and with basic things like even amounts of dollars (no cents<br/>\ninvolved). The other girls had to help her out a lot<br/>\n-- <br/>\nNatalie<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sundby5.blogspot.com/\">http://sundby5.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71458,"nextTopicId":71510}}
