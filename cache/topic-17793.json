I realize the<br/>\nproximity isn&#39;t helpful, but the site had referrals for other<br/>\ngeographical area and links to sites for grieving children, probably<br/>\nsome other resources.  Go to www.fernside.org <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that the reaction is perfectly normal.  Grief is a process that<br/>\none goes through - or not.  To some extent, people can choose to delay<br/>\nor deny the grieving process.  Then they cannot let it go.  It can haunt<br/>\nthem decades later.  Those children had many changes to cope with and<br/>\ntrudging forward stoically may have seemed the only way.  The anger<br/>\ntoward homeschoolers could simply be a direction for the anger they may<br/>\nfeel losing there parent and primary caregiver.  Yet grief is very<br/>\npersonal and individual, so each one must have their own needs<br/>\naddressed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a rough road, no matter what, but from a more distant perspective,<br/>\nI see it as a potentially good opportunity for the family - widow and<br/>\nhis children - to face and go through the journey of grief.<br/>\n<br/>\nA local family lost the mom last fall and the kids had to return to<br/>\nschool.  It&#39;s hard for me to imagine them liking it and hating the<br/>\nhomeschooling arena...except as a defensive reaction.  What a horrible<br/>\nway to be put  into that institutional system!<br/>\n<br/>\nHope they will follow through on getting some assistance,<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17770,"nextTopicId":6447}}
