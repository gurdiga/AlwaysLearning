There are still many <br/>\nsites available. We&#39;ve done this in past years and it&#39;s always nice <br/>\nto have other families coming and going throughout the week.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeckscher State Park is a short car ride away from Long Island&#39;s <br/>\nbarrier island ocean beaches. The park itself offers great bike <br/>\ntrails, a bay beach, fishing, clamming, crabbing, boat ramp into <br/>\nGreat South Bay (great for Kayaking and canoeing) and a huge <br/>\nswimming pool along with playground, basketball courts, etc - all <br/>\nwithin the park. While the park is huge, the campground itself is <br/>\nshaded and simple as state parks tend to be, however, it does have a <br/>\ndecent bathhouse. The small campground office puts on a family video <br/>\nin the evenings and we&#39;ve sometimes brought our own movie which the <br/>\npark ranger was willing to use.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past, while camping at the park, we have done many great day <br/>\ntrip adventures to different Fire Island ocean beaches. It&#39;s a short <br/>\n20 minute drive to Robert Moses and Fire Island Ferries nearby. <br/>\nSunken Forest/Sailors Haven on Fire Island has a nature center, <br/>\nnature trials and kids programs throughout the week. The Light house <br/>\nat Robert Moses also has a museum tour and boardwalk trail over the <br/>\ndunes. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is easy grocery shopping within 10 minutes from the park and a <br/>\ngreat farm stand and health food store in Sayville less than 20 <br/>\nminutes away. Also - being on Long Island - you have all <br/>\nthe &#39;benefits&#39; of suburban amenities you can imagine within a 20 <br/>\nminute radius. We&#39;ve spent rainy days at laundry mats and Barnes & <br/>\nNoble or nearby movie theaters if needed - I think there is a local <br/>\nroller rink - though we&#39;ve never gone. One year we ventured to the <br/>\nbig water park further out on long island. Our family usually spends <br/>\none day of the camping trip driving out to Montauk early in the <br/>\nmorning and returning to the campground late at night. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past we&#39;ve kept it pretty flexible and loose, not doing too <br/>\nmuch planning so that families and individuals can follow their own <br/>\nneeds while providing a great group experience. This camping trip is <br/>\norganized in such a fashion that being together doesn&#39;t mean anyone <br/>\nis obligated to follow anyone else&#39;s agenda or schedule, however, <br/>\nthere is always a lot of overlap, shared meals, shared bike trips, <br/>\nbeach trips, pool trips, etc. If we&#39;re a large group, we try not to <br/>\ncomplicate the trip by expecting or planning an entire group to do <br/>\nthe same thing each day throughout the week. Though group outings <br/>\nare great!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe booked site #11. Adjacent sites are available: site 10 & 12 & 20, <br/>\n21 & 22. Some for the entire 8 or 9 nights some for just part of <br/>\nthat time. You&#39;ll find out when you go online or call reserve <br/>\namerica 1 800 456 camp (2267).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want more information or details please feel free to contact <br/>\nme directly. And feel free to spread the word to other <br/>\nunschoolers/unschooling lists. <br/>\n<br/>\nLisa Heyman<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Lmanathome@...\">Lmanathome@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26499,"nextTopicId":26501}}
