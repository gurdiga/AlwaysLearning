For my daughter I just wasn&#39;t able to meet her social needs.  And we had a 4-h group, a girl scout troupe, went to park days, tried book clubs, science club, dance party date, signed her up for any class she wanted, I feel like I exhausted all my resources.  None of what I could offer had 400 + kids her age for her to chose from.  And that&#39;s what she needed and wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she first started saying she wanted to try school, I don&#39;t feel like I was deliberately sabotaging her desire to go to school at the time (I realize that now). In fact I told myself I was being supportive of it, I took her to school so she could have lunch with friends, made arrangements so she could ride the bus, even signed her up for half days...all which in hind-site made her feel that much more different.  And yes, I have one of those kids who like to &quot;fit in&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;m mainly responding cause if I can help someone avoid the 2nd guessing and guilt of them growing up and saying they wished they were never homeschooled then I suggest you put their desires first.  Let them try it, if home is a better match for them, they&#39;ll be back, if it&#39;s not, they&#39;ll be happy.  At that is ultimately the most important thing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI can tell you that having a parent at home with an unschooling mindset is a great asset for a kid who chooses school.:)  So enjoy each day that they chose to be home. :) :)<br/>\n<br/>\namy g<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cindyg&quot; &lt;luvkadcl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am curious as to why they want/wanted to go to school?

I realize now I wasn&#39;t very respectful or supportive of it, I bashed school quite a bit.  She eventually did try in 6th grade, unsuccessfully, and I take most of that blame.  She went again in 8th grade and I FINALLY got on board (I still kick myself for not being supportive sooner) and she&#39;s half way thru 9th grade and loving it.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was mostly upset because she didn&#39;t like her handwriting compared to everyone else&#39;s (which has improved immensely, cause dang, they write a lot in school),and once she got used to the work load she has been just fine.  We never fight about homework, she never complains about getting up and she always knows that she can come home whenever she wants.  But she swears she never will.  I blame that due to my lack of support when she originally wanted to go. Maybe she doesn&#39;t believe me anymore because her experience with school has been completely the opposite of what I said it would be like?<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t get me wrong, I wasn&#39;t obvious, I was quite good at manipulating a situation she knew nothing about.  I wish I would have supported her choice, really supported it.  Not just say you can do whatever you want, but really gotten behind her and encouraged her even when it went against what I wanted.  At least encouraged her to try and when she hit bumps in the road encouraged her to keep trying, instead of saying &quot;you wouldn&#39;t have that to deal with at home&quot; type stuff.  She always knew (and knows) she can come home...that wasn&#39;t the solution she was looking for, ever. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe she would have come back home, maybe she wouldn&#39;t.  But I can tell you that my daughter is happy where she&#39;s at, and that&#39;s what matters.

She decided to go and knew she could change her mind when she wanted to.  She stayed for 2 and 1/2 terms and then chose to come out.  My daughter fitted in sociallyj very well.  I had explained to the school that we had not followed a curriculum and so i was unable to tell them where she was up to academically but that I was confidetn she would be ok.  Her reading was fine and the teacher said her comprehension was great.  With maths she was moved to the next group within a month of being there.  I realise now I was a bit lax with the homework and further reading here has made me realise that I should have perhaps folllowed her up on it more as she had made the commitment to go to school. <br/>\nWe did not really do much preparation prior to her going other than talk about what might happen in a school day and she already had friends who were in school and had shared their experiences.<br/>\nhth<br/>\nblessings<br/>\nmichelle<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;mascire2&quot; &lt;amiersa2@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just wondering if anyone can share their child&#39;s experience with deciding to go to school after being unschooled?
