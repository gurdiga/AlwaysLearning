There are principles, and<br/>\n&gt; combinations, and exceptions. If the posts are kept fairly general, or moved<br/>\n&gt; toward generalities after the first pass, those responses become some of the<br/>\n&gt; quotes and passages that are saved on my site, Joyce&#39;s, and refrigerator<br/>\n&gt; doors around the world.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Things like these came out of discussions here, other lists, or<br/>\n&gt; unschooling.info, unschooling.com, familyRUNning...<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/quotes\">http://sandradodd.com/quotes</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Those who write are clarifying their own thoughts and honing their<br/>\n&gt; abilities to see which part of an account is fluff and what is the core<br/>\n&gt; issue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Some of those who are reading are discovering which writers here will be<br/>\n&gt; their favorites.

And no three year old is yet<br/>\n&gt; assured of staying home the next year or the one after. Schools are<br/>\n&gt; everywhere. No one &quot;gets credit&quot; in a discussion like this for an<br/>\n&gt; unimpressive claim of having read a whole website or section, or having<br/>\n&gt; unschooled for three years when the reports are so contradictory and the<br/>\n&gt; situations are so troublesome. The only credit that&#39;s worth a damn is the<br/>\n&gt; loving response of the child.

When I was a teen people were amazed that I was &quot;so good&quot; so young.  When I was in my 20&#39;s, it was just guitar playing.  I didn&#39;t learn anything else after thoes days, so now it&#39;s relatively lame, and I don&#39;t keep callouses, and my hands are getting stiffer.   But when I said &quot;I&#39;ve only been playing four months,&quot; when I was fifteen, I was GREAT!  Now, having played for over 40 years, I don&#39;t have much to show for it.    There was move for a while, in our SCA region, for people to tell how long it had taken them to create a certain piece of art, when they entered it into a competition.  I objected and was overruled.  I was a judge in the first regional competition in which the hours invested was information presented to the judges.   HORRIBLE.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I saw something that wasn&#39;t attractive or useful (to me, and I had been pressed to be a judge against my will for various reasons too long to explain here), and the maker said &quot;100 hours,&quot; I cringed.  What wonders could have been wrought with 100 hours if he or she had done other things with that time?  If someone said &quot;five hours&quot; about something similar, I would soften right up.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone says &quot;I never heard of unschooling until yesterday, and I spank, and...&quot; the response will be different than if someone says &quot;I&#39;ve been unschooling for a few years, read everything there is to read, and I spank because I want to and I don&#39;t want a lecture about spanking, but...&quot;  the reaction will be different because the person tried to jump the line and claim experience and tried to waive off basic advice on the grounds that she wasn&#39;t &quot;at a basic level.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not so simple.  I&#39;ve been parenting now for over 24 and a half years.  If I weren&#39;t doing better now than I was when I started, I don&#39;t think this list would exist.  If there weren&#39;t things that clearly do help, and absolutely do hurt, nobody would be coming to this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis IS simple, to me:  If people stop coming to this list, I will easily find something else to do with my hundred hours.  But as long as someone, anyone, is interested in considering what would make  her children&#39;s lives more peaceful and her own life richer, more moral, and better, I&#39;m probably going to be willing to help.  I can sometimes tell the difference between a sincere &quot;please help&quot; and a just-for-show &quot;I have so much respect for you, and would love for you to help me find ways to make my children&#39;s lives more peaceful and my own life richer.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Reactions to rough discussions","postDate":"1295796900","msgId":59113,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIzQjNERDY5LTdFM0QtNEM4OC04NDhCLTIyNTJFNzYzMzYyMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIzNTgxMS40NDc5Ni5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDgubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDc4MzJFNEFCLUIyOUUtNEJDQi1CQTY3LUI4OEM0MUIwNUQxRUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDIzNTgxMS40NDc5Ni5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDgubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":59111,"nextInTopic":59115,"prevInTime":59112,"nextInTime":59114,"topicId":59103,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-What really helped in an odd sort of way, was meeting, in real life, just really terrible parents, and dealing with them.

Not all parents in the <br/>\nworld are even trying to be half way decent parents, and boy have I met some of <br/>\nthose! That reality helps me keep online unschooling stuff in perspective!-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a good point.  A few times someone has become agitated on the side, about an exchange here, and suggested maybe I, or someone, should **DO SOMETHING** about how terrible a parent someone has come here and confessed to being, but no...  these are parents who have found unschooling and asked questions about it.   And they can&#39;t &quot;unsee&quot; what is written directly to them.  They can froth up and Donald-Duck themselves into a frenzy of self-righteous indignation and tell us we&#39;re stupid and they should never have asked us.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of them will be that defensive forever.  For some of them, it&#39;s the reason their kids aren&#39;t in school. They couldn&#39;t understand or even consider why there would be guidelines for kids in school, or their parents.  They (or their kids) couldn&#39;t begin to get along with others.  They didn&#39;t go toward something more peaceful, they backed out cussing and screaming without much of a plan.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the, even if they came to unschooling after dramatic exits, can manage to think and wait enough to find some calm objectivity.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the people who leave the list write later, sometimes on the list, sometimes on the side  to me or one of the other moderators, saying that they were furious at first, and thought we were mean and crazy, and they&#39;re sorry they reacted so defensively.  I assume there are more who change their minds and don&#39;t admit it.  Some just sneak back quietly.  Some go to another discussion and behave better.  Some probably avoid discussions, but do the best they can with what they read when they were there.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome suggestions will dwell in a person, no matter how angry she starts off, and will dissolve into her consciousness gradually over the years.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat knowledge has helped me be calmer when someone throws a big fit.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondarily, I know there are readers who don&#39;t write who sometimes get more out of a heated discussion than calm advisement and quiet brainstorming.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are people who see this list and think they could do better simply by answering questions in sweet voices.  But sweet voices without experience are just nicey-niceness without substance.  A few people who left this list because they thought we should be nicer, and no other reason, go out and give very light advice, quoting truisms they mostly understand, at best, and telling people everything will be okay.  That bothers me more than knowing someone spanks, because they lure dozens or hundreds of parents into lame situations without strong voices of experienced unschoolers who have the integrity to risk their own comfort to say &quot;This will harm your child, and your own happiness.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if there were a child who somehow didn&#39;t know or care that he was being hit, the mom is still a person who chooses to hit.  She&#39;s still a person who has not found alternatives and made good choices that make her a more peaceful person.   In the realm of virtue and integrity, she can&#39;t have it if her best ideas is hitting a child.  Too often, I think, we talk about the effect on child and relationship without remembering individual virtue.  When a parent becomes a better person, good decisions are more easily made.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Reactions to rough discussions","postDate":"1295794406","msgId":59111,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ1MjA0Ny4zMzc3LnFtQHdlYjgxNTA2Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDc4MzJFNEFCLUIyOUUtNEJDQi1CQTY3LUI4OEM0MUIwNUQxRUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDc4MzJFNEFCLUIyOUUtNEJDQi1CQTY3LUI4OEM0MUIwNUQxRUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":59104,"nextInTopic":59113,"prevInTime":59110,"nextInTime":59112,"topicId":59103,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I wrote an e-mail last night and I did not send as I thought I was too upset to have a clear mind and write something that would help .

Since I came online to discuss unschooling, I&#39;ve been in my 40&#39;s and 50&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor over a dozen years I&#39;ve been clear that we *can* discuss the ideas without putting a spotlight in the eyes of a poster and without knowing all the details of a family or relationship.  There are principles, and combinations, and exceptions.  If the posts are kept fairly general, or moved toward generalities after the first pass, those responses become some of the quotes and passages that are saved on my site, Joyce&#39;s, and refrigerator doors around the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings like these came out of discussions here, other lists, or unschooling.info, unschooling.com, familyRUNning...<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/quotes\">http://sandradodd.com/quotes</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThose who write are clarifying their own thoughts and honing their abilities to see which part of an account is fluff and what is the core issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of those who are reading are discovering which writers here will be their favorites.  Old timers see new writers come along and share a dazzling point or a particularly good insight.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther readers are letting the words flow by and over them as waves of examples of what not to do, or scenarios they will manage to avoid because of suggestions shared by experienced unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI rarely obsess about these things, though I do spend MANY hours a day, usually, on correspondence, webpage maintenance, blog posts and (lately) scheduling meet-ups and presentations.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone assures at length she spanks, and says she has a child who has been unschooled since birth, what I learn from that is that saying &quot;unschooled&quot; is not the same as living it.  And no three year old is yet assured of staying home the next year or the one after.  Schools are everywhere.  No one &quot;gets credit&quot; in a discussion like this for an unimpressive claim of having read a whole website or section, or having unschooled for three years when the reports are so contradictory and the situations are so troublesome.   The only credit that&#39;s worth a damn is the loving response of the child.  Secondary respect might come from other unschooling parents who see when someone is clear and honest, and when someone else is squirrelly or dodgy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would be more concerned and maybe lose sleep if the list became a place where bad ideas were treated the same as good ideas, or spanking wasn&#39;t pointed at immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe integrity of information and discussion on this list is important to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nMillions of people spank.  We can&#39;t stop that.  What we can prevent is the encouragement of that practice in the discussions on Always Learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nHundreds of people say they unschool when all they&#39;re doing is living punitive, controlling lives without sending their children to school.
