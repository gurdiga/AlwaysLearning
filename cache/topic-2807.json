And what we call bad<br/>\nbehavior is just what society has labeled unacceptable<br/>\ncommunication.<br/>\nCommunication is a very difficult thing.  It involves<br/>\ntranslating our<br/>\nthoughts into language and then presenting it to<br/>\nsomeone who can<br/>\ntranslate our language into thought.  Encoding and<br/>\ndecoding.   Bad<br/>\nbehavior is a way to translate frustration into a (non<br/>\nverbal) kind of<br/>\nlanguage that others can decode.  The trouble is,<br/>\nsometimes we don&#39;t<br/>\ndecode it the way the person would like us to.  When<br/>\nyou remember that <br/>\nall behavior has a goal,  then you can understand that<br/>\nbad behavior,<br/>\nmisbehavior, has a goal as well.

The real challenge is understanding that and<br/>\nhelping the person<br/>\nachieve their goal.  When you can do that, understand<br/>\ntheir particular<br/>\nform of (misbehavior) communication, then ( this is my<br/>\ntheory, <br/>\nanyway&lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n you can help them find less disruptive ways to<br/>\ncommunicate their<br/>\nfrustrations and achieve their goals. <br/>\nImagine what a parent&#39;s negative reaction to a child&#39;s<br/>\n(misbehavior)<br/>\nattempt at communication says to the child.  &quot;I don&#39;t<br/>\ncare what you<br/>\nwant.&quot;  &quot;I don&#39;t care what you need&quot;  That&#39;s what a<br/>\nchild trying to<br/>\ncommunicate a goal or desire (misbehaving)  hears in<br/>\nreply to her <br/>\nefforts<br/>\nwhen a parent spanks. (ALSO, a form of nonverbal<br/>\ncommunication but<br/>\ninterestingly enough, NOT considered by the offender<br/>\nto be <br/>\nunacceptable.<br/>\n)   Most parents would never say to a child who<br/>\npolitely asks for<br/>\nsomething to eat &quot;I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re hungry!&quot;  But<br/>\nthat&#39;s exactly<br/>\nwhat&#39;s happening when parents flip out over<br/>\nmisbehavior.  That&#39;s the<br/>\nmessage the child gets.  That&#39;s ugly.<br/>\nWhen you think about it, there are lots of people who<br/>\ncan&#39;t communicate<br/>\nwell with JUST language.

It<br/>\nmight not be as nice<br/>\nto LIVE with, but no one ever said having a smart kid<br/>\nwould be easy,<br/>\nright? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for this! <br/>\nI have been having some issues with what is  perceived<br/>\n(by myself and others) as rude behaviour of Tamzin&#39;s.<br/>\nReading this helped me to take a step back and see it<br/>\nfrom a different viewpoint. The behaviour is this: she<br/>\noften &#39;blanks&#39; people when they speak to her,<br/>\nparticularly adults (and sometimes children she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t know). She has done this in various degrees<br/>\nfor years. At first I thought it was shyness, but she<br/>\nalso does it to people she&#39;s known for ages (including<br/>\nmy mom). She says she doesn&#39;t know why she does it,<br/>\nand she recognises that it&#39;s rude, but she can&#39;t seem<br/>\nto stop herself when she&#39;s doing it. Also it seems to<br/>\nbe random (for example, she doesn&#39;t always &#39;blank&#39; my<br/>\nmom, just about 1/3 of the time &lt;sigh&gt;).<br/>\nI would appreciate some feedback from the group on how<br/>\nto deal with this. I&#39;ve run out of ideas! By the way,<br/>\nshe&#39;s 7 years old.

One thing that has really helped me is changing<br/>\nthe vocabulary I learned as a child, the kind of negative terms for<br/>\nnormal kid actions that were so common then, into words that are more<br/>\nrespectful of a child&#39;s reality. Changing the words in my head made *me*<br/>\nmore patient and understanding. So, children don&#39;t talk back in my<br/>\nhouse, although they might interrupt and need a little guidance on how<br/>\nto do that more effectively. And I try, don&#39;t always succeed, in seeing<br/>\nthe &quot;rudeness&quot; in my children as an opportunity to show them how our<br/>\nactions influence how others respond to us. I think that I was really<br/>\nshort changed as a child when an adult would slap a label on an action<br/>\nof mine without really trying to respond to the need behind it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that when a &quot;button&quot; of mine really gets &quot;pushed&quot; that I need to<br/>\nlook at it closely and use it as an opportunity to examine old hurts and<br/>\nassumptions about life and living with others that I learned as a child<br/>\nthat might be valid and might not be. In other words, just because it<br/>\npushes me strongly doesn&#39;t mean I am automatically *right*.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeggy<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Hickman wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hello Everyone,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m Mary, the mom with the rudish 7 year old.
