I&#39;ve never been one who was too concerned with what others thought. I don&#39;t need much feedback about what I&#39;m doing. I really couldn&#39;t care less if people I know go home and talk about how my kids are neglected because they don&#39;t do anything but watch TV and play video games all day. Those people have no idea what our lives are really like. They are also the same people who comment on how smart and interesting and engaging my children are until they learn that we don&#39;t do school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never cared much if my babies were following developmental guidelines.

I get quite confused when friends talk about some obligation their families are putting on them that&#39;s completely unreasonable, like some with a newborn and 2 other young children and a husband who&#39;s deployed who is still expected to drive 2 states away with said children on her own to visit family but the family without kids or at least with 2 adults won&#39;t visit her. My response is, just don&#39;t do it but my friend can&#39;t do that. I really don&#39;t get that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hated school. I have never been a joiner. I&#39;ve always been a bit of a rebel. I think all of that made deschooling relatively easy for me.
