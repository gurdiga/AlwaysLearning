One of the boys would<br/>\nactually have to stand in there to do the recording. <br/>\nSo, all the girls at the school and every girl on basketball teams or<br/>\nvolley ball teams from seven other schools that have come here to<br/>\ncompete, are to one degree or another, on those tapes.  <br/>\nThis is the second year the boys have been taping.   There is no way to<br/>\nbe sure of the number of tapes they made (ten were confiscated) or the<br/>\nnumber of copies they made or how many others they shared the tapes with,<br/>\nhere or over the Internet.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir trial was Monday and today the local paper published their<br/>\nsentences.   Thirty days in jail and 250 hours community service.   <br/>\nThe boys are the sons of prominent citizens and they have always gotten<br/>\ngood grades and have been good at sports.   &quot;In spite of that&quot; the judge<br/>\nsaid, it was such a serious offence that the sentence had to be tough. <br/>\nSheesh.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m left thinking homeschoolers won&#39;t be having to answer that &quot;what<br/>\nabout socialization?&quot; question around here for awhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11356,"nextTopicId":11360}}
