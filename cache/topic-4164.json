When I was little,<br/>\ngrowing up in Orange County, you could see pockets of buildings amid the<br/>\ngroves.  My best friend and I used to play in the one near her house, hours<br/>\nof imaginative games, nature observation, pure pleasure.

The latest one was my on-going request for dd to make her bed. 10 yo dd had no problem with making her bed and even said how much more she liked her room when it was picked up and the bed was made but 12 yo dd hated it.  So I asked her why it was such a big deal.  She said she could not see the point in making her bed when she was just going to sleep in it again and it did not matter to her.  I told her it really made the house feel good to me when the beds were made so I would be willing to make her bed if she would like to help out in another way.  She decided to empty the dishwasher each morning instead of doing the bed.  I never have to remind her and I would rather make a bed than empty the dishwasher any day. <br/>\n<br/>\nCould you give us an example of a tantrum situation?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt could have something to do with something feeling overwhelming.  I can look at a job and know exactly where to start, what my steps will be, and even have a visual image of what it will look like when I&#39;m done.  I had trouble understanding my dd when she continually said she did not know what to do.  So what may seem like an easy request to you might not look so easy to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last thing.  One of my kids can&#39;t eat artificial dyes, flavorings or preservatives without going into tantrums over the smallest things.

The<br/>\n&quot;How to Talk&quot; book by Faber & Mazlich was helpful to me.

I told the girls that I would buy them a treat there<br/>\nand suggested that they each bring some of their own money to buy<br/>\nsomething, if they wanted to.  I overheard one of the moms tell her dd<br/>\nthat she couldn&#39;t have any candy bc she hadn&#39;t eaten lunch yet.  (Sounded<br/>\nlike the old me).  Another mom was telling her kid to pay attention and<br/>\nask questions so she would learn something bc that&#39;s why they came.  It<br/>\nwas so great to just let my kids be there.

We do not watch tv during dinner and everyone sits at the table.  I feel this is a good thing and here are my reasons.  Dh is not home all day and this is a good time for us to catch up with him.  In addition to the dinner tradition, I try to spend some time one-on-one with each dd at night before I go to bed.  I spend plenty of time with them during the day but this time is diffenent and special, like dinner time can be.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe TV is never on because it would take away from our interaction with one another.  The *message* being conveyed is that we feel spending time listening to each other and giving each other our full attention is important.  Yes this can be done in many different ways and I&#39;m not implying that anyone without the sit-down-together dinner tradition feels it is less important.  I&#39;m saying this is one way we show it is a priority.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople feel comfort in positive traditions.  Children also like repitition.  Just think about how many times kids can read the same book or watch the same movie over and over again.<br/>\nCertainly if this time together is not positive, there would be no reason to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTV can be enjoyed as an activity which we do together, like watching the Super Bowl.  TV is usually not going to be on if we want to talk and have interesting discussions.  This does not mean we are limiting TV.  It means we are setting a priority to giving each other our full attention.  I find it rude when I visit someone and they are distracted by the TV if our purpose in getting together is to talk and listen.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf for some reason the kids did not want to eat dinner as a family, I would explain why we do and give them the choice.   Believe me, they question things that do not make sense to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":3880872,"authorName":"Karen","from":"&quot;Karen&quot; &lt;kbmatlock@...&gt;","profile":"mattieleah61","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE:  question about saying yes","postDate":"1012886359","msgId":4190,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJORUFJS0ZJTUlMREZIQ0JQUE1NT0VIQkNOQUEua2JtYXRsb2NrQHlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMTI4ODE0MTEuMjAwNy41NjI4My5tMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4188,"nextInTopic":4199,"prevInTime":4189,"nextInTime":4191,"topicId":4164,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... _________________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

Most nights the kids help me cook or<br/>\nat least supervise and ask a lot of questions.  Since we usually have<br/>\ndinner within 30 minutes of my husband returning home from his work,<br/>\nit&#39;s a good time for us to touch base about our days.  If someone is<br/>\nwatching a TV show, we work out an accomodation - sometimes the show<br/>\ngets taped to watch later, sometimes we hold dinner til the show or<br/>\ntape is done, whatever seems to work for that situation.  The TV is<br/>\noff though - since it&#39;s far enough from the table that no one would<br/>\nbe able to watch it or hear it - and I live in CA which has high<br/>\nelectricity rates.

It makes sense to me to let them make real choices,<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a monthly family budget that includes a fast food line item. If the<br/>\nmoney&#39;s there, it&#39;s there, if it&#39;s not, it&#39;s not. Mostly, it&#39;s there. It<br/>\nmakes it easier because we put the budget together in advance, based on what<br/>\nwe can actually afford, so there&#39;s no on-the-spot morality to it. If the<br/>\ngirls began to feel seriously shorted in the fast-food department, we&#39;d<br/>\nreview the budget with them and figure out where some extra money could come<br/>\nfrom, but so far they&#39;re fine with how it works.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s important to you that the family eat dinner together with the TV<br/>\noff, you might ask yourself why. What do you gain from that? Why do you feel<br/>\nthat that&#39;s more right than watching TV during dinner?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not a believer in the magic of family dinners. When I grew up, we had<br/>\nsuch dinners, just as directed by all the parenting experts, and they were<br/>\ntorture sessions with my brother and I playing court jester to distract my<br/>\nstep-father from emotionally thrashing our other two siblings. It&#39;s no<br/>\nwonder I was a thin child.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe occasional family dinner we have now (very occasional, except when we<br/>\neat out, as the dining room table doubles as our shipping department and is<br/>\noften unusable for more than two people at a time) is relaxed and happy and<br/>\nnice, but that&#39;s because our family is relaxed and happy and nice, not<br/>\nbecause there is something inherently marvelous about the location and time.<br/>\nAnd conversation and being together happen spontaneously through the days,<br/>\nweeks and months here, without being scheduled from 6 to 7 p.m.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] question about saying yes","postDate":"1012871071","msgId":4166,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRjLjYwY2M5MTEuMjk5MDg5OWZAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":4164,"nextInTopic":4167,"prevInTime":4165,"nextInTime":4167,"topicId":4164,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/4/02 5:54:10 PM, megates@juno.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-407354795\">In a message dated 2/4/02 5:54:10 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:megates@...\">megates@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; When the kids ask me to stop by McDonald&#39;s to buy their lunch is it OK to<br/>\nsay, &quot;no, because I don&#39;t want to spend $5-6 on lunch for two kids.&quot;?

I would wonder whether the purpose was discipline or table <br/>\nmanners or what.  Or are you worried about what &quot;they&quot; would think if &quot;they&quot; <br/>\ncame over and found the kids eating at one table watching a video and the <br/>\nparents sitting together being able to talk about adult stuff?  What do the <br/>\nkids want to do? (Does it matter to you what the kids would prefer?)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have very rarely asked our kids specifically to come and sit.  Mostly when <br/>\nthere was company or someone had made a fancy meal that needed steak knives <br/>\n(practicality), but the older they get, the more likely they are to WANT to <br/>\ncome and sit and eat with us.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my family when I was a kid, and in other houses I was familiar with, as <br/>\nkids got older they found more and more excuses to get out of dinner, adn NOT <br/>\nbeing there was the desirable thing.  I think it&#39;s very cool that my kids are <br/>\nthe other way, and have no aversion to sitting and hanging out with us.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have at least two and sometimes three tables set up at any one time (one <br/>\nin the library which is often for games but sometimes for meals) and when <br/>\nthere are extra people, some might eat at the dining table and some in the <br/>\nlibrary (one room away--also off the kitchen).  Or if just a table big enough <br/>\nfor six or seven, the first six or seven who want to sit down might sit there <br/>\nand the rest wander off elsewhere.  I&#39;ve never seen hurt feelings yet about <br/>\nnot getting a place.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomehow it&#39;s become smooth.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":5325456,"authorName":"megates@juno.com","from":"megates@...","profile":"lamaribelle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"question about saying yes","postDate":"1012870058","msgId":4164,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwMjA0LjE2NDc0Mi4tMTk1NDAxNS4wLm1lZ2F0ZXNAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4166,"prevInTime":4163,"nextInTime":4165,"topicId":4164,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"How do folks handle saying yes or no about things that cost money?
