As <br/>\nit is we have more fun doing short shopping trips to more special food <br/>\nstores for the few gourmet type items or making a family outing of Costco <br/>\n(which has great take out food and lots of cool samples) than for regular <br/>\nold groceries. When Jayn was younger, before the deliveries became <br/>\navailable, we would shop at all kinds of odd hours and Jayn enjoyed it. But <br/>\nin those days James was usually available to carry the bags when I got home <br/>\nand now he almost never is at the times when I can easily shop. Vons <br/>\ndelivery has been a godsend for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point was and is if you are regularly running out of something that <br/>\neveryone likes a change in the way it is shopped for could be helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I  <br/>\nget mine<br/>\ndelivered as needed.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn wrote that.  It reminded me of the differences in availability  <br/>\nof shopping to different families.   There are families in northern  <br/>\nNew Mexico (probably lots of places) who live so far from town that  <br/>\nwhen they come for groceries they bring a couple of coolers, and buy  <br/>\nmonths&#39; worth.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live such short walking distance from a big grocery store that if  <br/>\nwe need eggs or milk, it can be gotten without disruption to the cooking<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there&#39;s the in between.  But going to the store with me or their  <br/>\ndad was one of the highlights of our kids&#39; lives--it was doing real  <br/>\nwork with adults who loved them, and we could have a leisurely stroll  <br/>\naround the store and it was warm in the winter and cool in the  <br/>\nsummer, and we could talk and visit, and they learned about the names  <br/>\nof things and how to weigh vegetables and where things come from  <br/>\ndifferent times of the year.   Incorporate the store into your  <br/>\nunschooling life!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Here&#39;s how I avoid running out of high volume use foods, other  <br/>\nthan the<br/>\nreally fast perishables. I have one &quot;in the fridge&quot; (or on the shelf)  <br/>\nbeing<br/>\nused and one unopened &quot;in the pantry&quot;. As soon as the in-use one is  <br/>\ndone, it<br/>\nimmediately goes on the shopping list on the side of the fridge.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWe keep extras too, and refillable large containers of some things.   <br/>\nThe small bottle of vegetable oil is in the cabinet in the kitchen.   <br/>\nThe gallon to refill with is in the pantry.  We buy more spaghetti  <br/>\nwhen we use the second to last one, not after the last one.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s can be harder for young couples without much money, but it can  <br/>\nbe something to remember.  When things are on sale that you know you  <br/>\nwould have bought anyway, buy two or three and stash them by, but  <br/>\ndon&#39;t wait until they&#39;re completely gone before putting it back on  <br/>\nthe list.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving something seem to be unlimited is what will help your kids get  <br/>\nover their craving for it.  If they KNOW there&#39;s more ice cream (or  <br/>\nanything), and there will always or usually be, they won&#39;t be in a  <br/>\nhurry to eat &quot;their share&quot; (or all of it) out of fear of it being gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are seasons to things.  Lately here it&#39;s been bagels.  It&#39;s a  <br/>\nstaple and we buy more before they&#39;re gone.  For a while it was  <br/>\nsandwich ham that was very popular.  Before that, individual  <br/>\nmicrowaved pizzas.  Each interest was fulfilled and then it wasn&#39;t  <br/>\nthe most popular thing for a while again.  A year ago, corn dogs.  We  <br/>\nalways had corndogs.  Going with your children&#39;s direction instead of  <br/>\nagainst it will help.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287815876,"authorName":"Robyn L.
