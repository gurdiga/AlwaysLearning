Maybe you had expectations as to what being interested in life would look like, and since they haven&#39;t met those expectations (because they were interested in other things, or spent their time otherwise than you think they would) you and they think they somehow failed.</div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1670392557ygrps-yiv-1525535114yiv6269108633yui_3_16_0_1_1429259136486_5590\"><br></div><div dir=\"ltr\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-1670392557ygrps-yiv-1525535114yiv6269108633yui_3_16_0_1_1429259136486_4197\">You said that they were interested in watching TV and videos.

If they felt that you did not value what they did when you unschooled, then it was probably hard for them to enjoy themselves and trust that they were indeed learning. <br clear=\"none\"></div><div dir=\"ltr\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-1670392557ygrps-yiv-1525535114yiv6269108633yui_3_16_0_1_1429259136486_4912\"><br clear=\"none\"></div><div dir=\"ltr\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-1670392557ygrps-yiv-1525535114yiv6269108633yui_3_16_0_1_1429259136486_5292\">It is hard to see learning happening naturally if you do not get interested in what the kids like to do. And if you can&#39;t see the learning happening naturally through your kids&#39; interests, it&#39;s probably even more difficult for your husband to see it. Do you think he could still be convinced that unschooling works if you show him you daughters&#39; enjoyment of their activities as well as everything they learn? You can&#39;t share the value of unschooling with someone if you haven&#39;t seen it for yourself first.<br clear=\"none\"></div><div dir=\"ltr\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-1670392557ygrps-yiv-1525535114yiv6269108633yui_3_16_0_1_1429259136486_6040\"><br clear=\"none\"></div><div dir=\"ltr\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-1670392557ygrps-yiv-1525535114yiv6269108633yui_3_16_0_1_1429259136486_6247\">Cecile<br clear=\"none\"></div></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1670392557ygrps-yiv-1525535114yiv6269108633yui_3_16_0_1_1429259136486_2862\"></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75801,"nextTopicId":75814}}
