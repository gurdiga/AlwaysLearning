It was rated PG-13, I <br/>\nthink. Ben said that it had a warning---one he&#39;d never seen before: <br/>\nParents should really consider taking children to this one. I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow where he saw that, but it hit him as odd.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuncan understands movie/tv/game/ratings. He knows we don&#39;t forbid <br/>\nanything, but some one rated them that way for a reason. Maybe not a <br/>\ngood reason! &lt;g&gt; But someone felt the need to rate it as such&such.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe movis is funny and clever and silly and...scary. Ben and I took <br/>\nDuncan and a friend. About half-way through, Duncan grabs Ben&#39;s hand <br/>\nand they scoot out quickly. Dunc was frightened. I didn&#39;t realize, as I <br/>\nwas sitting on the other side of Ben. They stayed out for 5-7 minutes <br/>\nmaybe and then came back in. They missed the almost-attack of the wolf <br/>\non the girl. Probably a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was fine for the rest of the movie (in my lap &lt;g&gt;), but he&#39;s been <br/>\nsleeping downstairs on the sofa since. Next week, Ben&#39;s out of town, so <br/>\nI&#39;m guessing I&#39;ll have bed company! &lt;G&gt;(But that would have happened <br/>\nanyway!)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, he *knows* this is a movie. He *knows* it&#39;s fake, but it was still <br/>\nfrightening---just a little. He&#39;s seen plenty of &quot;R&quot; movies that were <br/>\nmuch less damaging to him; now he wants to know why! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not that he wishes he didn&#39;t go. He&#39;s glad he saw it, he says. But <br/>\nhe was very glad to be able to leave when he needed to---and Ben was <br/>\ngood to be willing to jump up at an interesting part.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know so many parents who would have refused to leave and demand that <br/>\nthe child watch it because the child asked to come. And then make fun <br/>\nof him for being scared. Duncan trusts us to help filter---OR help <br/>\navoid---situations that make him uncomfortable. We didn&#39;t realize that <br/>\nhis would frighten him---he seems so tough most of the time! &lt;g&gt; But <br/>\nI&#39;m glad he trusts us and felt OK asking for help when he was scared.!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99936689,"authorName":"Barbara Mullins","from":"&quot;Barbara Mullins&quot; &lt;mozafamily@...&gt;","profile":"mozafamily","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: response to &quot;Stubborn ain&#39;t the half of it&quot;","postDate":"1126120766","msgId":22986,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRmbmVmdSt2NnFlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRmbjhyZCtsZWxmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":22984,"nextInTopic":22987,"prevInTime":22985,"nextInTime":22987,"topicId":22950,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... but ...

Suddenly we see the extensive<br/>\nnature of the commitment, and get a much greater idea of the scale of your<br/>\ndd&#39;s interest in animals and nature. We now start to understand also the<br/>\nsense of loss that you may feeling with this move away by dd from a shared<br/>\ninterest to a more individual one.

This sense of the scale was fairly<br/>\nimportant information. It might be time to start phasing back to a more<br/>\ncomfortably manageable number of critters.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other important information was about the newness of the cartoon<br/>\nwatching, and how it is a change in her life, a development - one could say<br/>\nan expansion of her interests. Starting to investigate ideas and information<br/>\nthat are maybe a little beyond the &quot;parental comfort zone&quot; could be seen as<br/>\na sign of increasing maturity and independence, rather than looking at the<br/>\ncontent of the tv programs as an indication of childishness. Our self-talk<br/>\nand the words we choose to describe our children matter. We can make the<br/>\nchoice to use a positive label, or a compassionate one, rather than the<br/>\ncriticizing or detrimental expression.<br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; this is a big adjustment for my husband and myself.  <br/>\nSoooooo, my husband was at wits end when he posted that question, and <br/>\nwas frustrated with some of these things, and yes, it came out very <br/>\nnegative,&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that seems to come through clearly when people are posting are<br/>\nnegative feelings such as frustrations, and negative attitudes such as<br/>\ncritical judgments. Sometimes people who are writing are not even aware of<br/>\nthe extent that negative predictive thinking or unkind (or even harsh)<br/>\nevaluations of their kids are permeating their thought processes. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy writing these events and problems down and then having some of the<br/>\napparent emotions and ideas behind them illuminated by the responders, we<br/>\nhave the opportunity to say to ourselves something like, &quot;Wow, I didn&#39;t<br/>\nrealize how strongly this was affecting me...I didn&#39;t get how much my tone<br/>\nis impinging on my kids...I didn&#39;t realize what assumptions I was still<br/>\nholding on to...I didn&#39;t understand what the ramifications of this<br/>\naction/attitude of mine could be....&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that the places where I am most defensive are those where I am most<br/>\nin the wrong. The very sense of feeling attacked, and the desire to deny,<br/>\nare the most useful clues for me that I should examine those actions or<br/>\nattitudes. Of course remembering that in the heat of the moment is the<br/>\nhardest part!<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; but please don&#39;t tell me that we are the only ones making mistakes<br/>\nalong this huge adventure. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one is likely to say that. I have never heard anyone say anything like<br/>\nthat. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I&#39;m sorry if we conjured up <br/>\nthoughts in peoples&#39; minds of a horrible family with poor, unloved <br/>\nchildren. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I didn&#39;t get that picture, although I was a bit worried about your pets<br/>\nfor a minute. I also had visions of you releasing a domesticated animal into<br/>\nthe wild which is a bad idea from several pov&#39;s, which I now see would not<br/>\nbe an accurate picture at all. I hate crickets en masse too - utterly<br/>\nillogical paranoia about them getting in my ears and eating my brain. I<br/>\nthought they could come freeze dried for reptiles - at least they would then<br/>\nbe silent.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am going to cross post something I wrote last week about tv content. For<br/>\nall the folk who have read it already, please feel free to switch off now. <br/>\n<br/>\nQuote begins:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;It has been the most pronounced incidence of synchronicity that I have<br/>\nyet noticed on the lists where there have been three mothers posting almost<br/>\nthe exact same sentiments on three Unschooling lists, specifically<br/>\nexpressing the same concerns about &quot;limiting to appropriate content&quot; with<br/>\nchildren of varying ages, from 2 yo to 6 year olds, to a 10 yo, and a 14 yo.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not really the forum for a lengthy dissertation into the discourses<br/>\nof television comedy, or a dissection of the semiotics of the sitcom as a<br/>\ndepiction of the American family - as entertaining as I would personally<br/>\nfind writing such an essay.<br/>\n<br/>\nNor is it necessarily as helpful to get into a lengthy &quot;I don&#39;t like show<br/>\nX&quot;...&quot;Oh I like show X a lot&quot; debate - because tastes differ, definitions of<br/>\n&quot;vulgar&quot; or funny differ, and it doesn&#39;t really get any further into the<br/>\nprinciples behind the ideas of choice and learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere seem to be two issues in reference to the content of tv programs or<br/>\nmovies. The first is the idea that the content, while not necessarily<br/>\nobjectionable in itself, is too &quot;mature&quot; for the children - either too scary<br/>\nor too sexually explicit seem to the main concerns. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the first situation I have found, similarly to what others have reported,<br/>\nthat Jayn is very good at self-care if she starts to become scared of<br/>\nimages, sounds or characters&#39; behavior. She also seems to have developed her<br/>\nown specific coping mechanisms for exploring the scary stuff including fast<br/>\nforwarding, going away for a minute, desensitizing herself with repeated<br/>\ngradual exposures, and role-playing games. I too have learnt the kind of<br/>\nmusic or images that disturb her, and will warn her if a program seems<br/>\nlikely to be scary. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the case of sexually explicit - and people have different places where<br/>\nthey will become concerned - I have found, again similarly to what others<br/>\nhave reported, that Jayn has zero interest in the sexual or even mere<br/>\nromantic antics of people on tv. She certainly is not seeking it out. If<br/>\nsomething comes on in the course of changing channels or she walks into the<br/>\nother room and something is on, she gets a kind of &quot;that looks stupid&quot;<br/>\nexpression and usually totally ignores it. At around 3, she used to enjoy<br/>\n&quot;Sex and the City&quot; because she liked the pretty dresses and sparkles, and<br/>\nwould just go play with her dolls during any of the incomprehensible to her<br/>\nsexual scenes. Now she just lumps adult themed shows of any kind (eg police<br/>\ndrama) together as &quot;boring&quot; or &quot;stupid garbage&quot; and asks for Disney channel.<br/>\nIt is only a matter of time before she starts expressing ideas and seeking<br/>\nclarification (her version of asking questions) on the odd sexual scenes she<br/>\nbumps into at times on tv.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** I will add that I believe that she will start seeking out or being<br/>\nattracted to programs with sexual content (of any kind) at the appropriate<br/>\ndevelopmental time when her inner questioning arrives at that place - or to<br/>\nput it conversely, she won&#39;t be interested until and unless she is &quot;ready&quot;<br/>\nto receive that kind of information, coupled with the additional guidance<br/>\nthat I will be able to give her about the level of reality that she is<br/>\nseeing. I try to see every new program as an opportunity for more<br/>\ncommunication between us.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second issue of concern has to do with the &quot;family values&quot; and behavior<br/>\nand relationships of characters in the shows. I have to agree that both the<br/>\ncharacters and the situations in teen sitcoms and movies often depict values<br/>\nthat are in conflict with the ideas of Unschooling, including lousy<br/>\nparenting, adults as adversarial and dumb simultaneously, and sibling<br/>\nconflict portrayed as normal and acceptable. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever whether these values are going to be genuinely internalized and<br/>\nadopted by our children is another question. I personally doubt it, despite<br/>\nthe experimental forays into these less than charming behaviors our kids<br/>\nsometimes engage in. I am seeing it for the first time - Jayn has started<br/>\ncalling me &quot;stupid head&quot; at odd times - from &quot;Lilo and Stitch&quot; (movie). I<br/>\nhave Trust that it will get old soon. I also endorse the idea of talking<br/>\nover in a genuine way specific behaviors or ideas, rather than making a<br/>\nnegative assessment of the show your kid loves. (I come and blurt the latter<br/>\nonto the lists instead of onto Jayn). ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAside from the fact that I doubt that any of us are remotely like any of<br/>\nthese detached, authoritarian or befuddled parents, the biggest, hugest,<br/>\nmost significant difference between our children and 100percent of the kids<br/>\nportrayed on any of these shows is: they are all in mandatory school.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese TV children&#39;s primary bonding relationships are shown as being with<br/>\ntheir friends and age peers, and with few exceptions, the majority of their<br/>\ntime is spent in the school hallways, on school related projects, including<br/>\nsome really contrived nonsense, and conversing with each other about school<br/>\nstuff or school people. Additionally, with the one exception of Ren Stevens<br/>\nwho likes it and is a butt of humor for that reason, they seem consider<br/>\nschool a necessary evil. <br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that these shows portray a heightened and exaggerated depiction of<br/>\nwhat we Unschoolers would consider some of the very real negatives of school<br/>\nas they apply to family life - the appropriation of almost all time with the<br/>\nconcomitant disintegration of close family relationships, the culture of<br/>\npeer approval and cliques and personality labeling (&quot;jocks&quot;, &quot;geeks&quot;,<br/>\n&quot;popular girls&quot;, etc), the separation and fostering of distrust and<br/>\ndisconnection between parents and children, the adult (parent or teacher) as<br/>\nboth incomprehensible and a killjoy even while they are &quot;humorously&quot;<br/>\ninfantile (esp. males), children as directly powerless in the face of school<br/>\nor parental rules so resorting to underhand strategies (hi jinks ensue!<br/>\n:P~~). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe entertainment value of these shows to schooled children, who undoubtedly<br/>\nrecognize themselves to a much greater degree, is likely partly in that very<br/>\nseparation from the parents. The tv kids usually spend almost no time in<br/>\nclass of any kind - more wishful thinking for the schooled kids. It is<br/>\npossible that these tv kids have more personal power and autonomy than the<br/>\nreal children - they certainly will do more outlandish stuff. The didactic<br/>\n&quot;mother knows best in the end&quot; message of most of these shows, is a small<br/>\nprice to pay (I mean for the schooled child viewers) for getting to watch<br/>\npeople make really dumb choices (dumber than they might make irl) and follow<br/>\nthrough the absurd results. I notice that &quot;grounding&quot; is the universal<br/>\npunishment, applied even after the &quot;lesson&quot; has been learned. <br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect that most of our children have much less identification with the<br/>\ncharacters. Maybe they watch this stuff with the same sense of disbelieving<br/>\nastonishment that some of us apply to Jerry Springer, or with the same<br/>\ncuriosity as pausing to view a car wreck or collapsed building. It is the<br/>\nvery &quot;otherness&quot; of these families that makes them interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked Jayn what she likes about &quot;That&#39;s So Raven&quot;, her current favorite. I<br/>\ndiscovered that her attraction to the show comes from her enjoyment of<br/>\nRaven&#39;s dress up as odd characters antics, and also she likes Raven&#39;s<br/>\nregular clothing which is heavy on the sparkle, feathers and embroidery. We<br/>\nrecord the programs, and sometimes if one of the other characters is the<br/>\nfeatured story that day, she will ask me to skip over those scenes that do<br/>\nnot include Raven herself. In other words the actual narrative or internal<br/>\n&quot;logic&quot; is irrelevant to Jayn&#39;s enjoyment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past Jayn has included shows that I don&#39;t like (for values) in her<br/>\nviewing schedule. Her interest has waned, not because I made any attempt to<br/>\nlimit, but because she received all she needed and her interests matured. We<br/>\nhad lots of conversations about specific moments that I disapproved of,<br/>\nalong the lines of other choices the characters could have made in those<br/>\nmoments.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnlike schooled kids, our children have the opportunity to continue to have<br/>\nauthentic relationships with us. We can continue to be the first and primary<br/>\nvalues influence in their lives, as well as their strongest safety net,<br/>\nregardless of what tv shows they like. I hope that it is our huge presence<br/>\nin their lives, and willingness to really listen without a hidden agenda,<br/>\nthat will ultimately mitigate any of the experimental &quot;bad&quot; behavior that<br/>\nthey may try on. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

It&#39;ll pass.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the pets, I guess I just wouldn&#39;t get anymore than I was willing to<br/>\ntake care of.  We have a guinea pig, two cats, and two horses.  The kids<br/>\nhelp with all of them but they are not required to.  I knew going into it<br/>\nthat the responsibility would fall on me, if the kids&#39; interest didn&#39;t hold<br/>\nand I had no problem with that.  We got them to enrich our lives.  At this<br/>\npoint, however, I am tapped for time/energy taking care of our pets and I<br/>\nwould not be willing to take on more responsibility for pets at this time.<br/>\nMy kids are 8 and 10.

It has taken me all day to gather my thoughts together about <br/>\nit since I was so upset about it all and feeling so condemned.  I can <br/>\ncertainly understand some of the responses due to the harshness of my <br/>\nhusbands&#39; question, but I need to explain.  First, I would like to <br/>\nthank Sandra for being more wholistic on your replies and not so <br/>\npersonal.  I have been reading Sandra&#39;s and Ren&#39;s(and many others) <br/>\nadvice for 2-3 years now and have always admired and respected their <br/>\nthoughts.  These sites are the only things that get me through <br/>\nsometimes, and so thankyou everybody out there for all your help!  I <br/>\nthink it is one reason why this has been so painful for me to have <br/>\ndealt with.  We have just been &quot;silent observers&quot; for so long, and <br/>\nfor our first advance onto the site to have been like this has been <br/>\nhurtful.  Regarding the pets, the situation is this.... my daughter <br/>\nloves reptiles and fish, and I also love critters, so we have <br/>\naccumulated MANY turtles, lizards, frogs, mice, rats, toads, geckoes, <br/>\ndragons, and she has numerous aquariums with crabs, saltwater fish <br/>\n(which she has caught herself) etc. over this last year.  We are very <br/>\nactive in her interest, fixing habitats for breeding, being active in <br/>\nthe local herpetological society, field trips, etc, etc. (And yes, we <br/>\nalso do many, many other activities with groups, friends, etc) With <br/>\nso many reptiles, we also have to have crickets....1 thousand a week, <br/>\nand of course, part of that is they get loose in the house, the cats <br/>\neat them and puke, and they chirp constantly(which I love!, but my dh <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t).  I realize that she cannot possibly take care of all these <br/>\nherself, and so I do a lot of the care.  She is very good about <br/>\ncaring for many of these, but my husband gets frustrated with the <br/>\namount of time it takes, we always wonder how much responsability she <br/>\nshould have with them (isn&#39;t that a normal concern?) and my husband <br/>\ndoes NOT like the crickets AT ALL crawling around the house at times <br/>\n(which I think is a normal dislike for many people).  OK, keep this <br/>\ninfo. in mind while I explain the TV part. Until the last 2 + months, <br/>\nthe kids main TV was the Science channel, Animal Planet, Funniest <br/>\nVideos, and of course we&#39;ve had our share of the classic cartoons.  <br/>\nOh, and we LOVE the Spirited Away movie!  The programs didn&#39;t seem to <br/>\ninterfere with other things going on.  We had dinners together, <br/>\n(discussed over Sandra&#39;s thinking sticks), we do the family bed, and <br/>\nwould all cuddle up and read 1-2 hours before bedtime.  Suddenly, our <br/>\ndd has an interest in the newer cartoons like Invader Zim,  The <br/>\nadventures of Billy and Mandy, and Ed, Edd and Eddie.  These are a <br/>\nbit different than Mickey Mouse, with name calling, puking up on each <br/>\nother, and just some stuff that I wasn&#39;t used to.  I&#39;m not saying <br/>\nthey are good or bad, just different and take adjusting to!  Also, <br/>\nthey now want to watch them ALOT, and not come to dinner if they are <br/>\non, and we don&#39;t have time now for our bedtime reading.  I know your <br/>\nsuggestions on working around them, and taping them, etc. are good <br/>\nones, but this is a big adjustment for my husband and myself.  <br/>\nSoooooo, my husband was at wits end when he posted that question, and <br/>\nwas frustrated with some of these things, and yes, it came out very <br/>\nnegative, and no, we would never have let an animal die for a <br/>\nlesson.  The letting go of control is a hard lesson for us to learn, <br/>\nand we need the support of this group, and I don&#39;t want to feel like <br/>\nwe are these horrible, bad people if we would ever want to make <br/>\nanother post.  We realize a lot of this is OUR problem, but please <br/>\ndon&#39;t tell me that we are the only ones making mistakes along this <br/>\nhuge adventure.  Yes, we love our kids and worry about them probably <br/>\ntoo much. While I&#39;m at it, I would like some insight into something <br/>\nelse.  My dd has also found that she likes scary movies.  (Rated R <br/>\nlike ALiens, The Thing, and recently The Scream)  She has always <br/>\nloved scary things since a little girl, but I need some thoughts on <br/>\nletting her watch &quot;horror&quot; movies at this age (10).  I have never <br/>\nbeen a horror film lover, so I don&#39;t know what they are all like, and <br/>\nif they are OK.  I have read to let the kids watch what they want, <br/>\nand they will decide if it is something they like, or will ask to <br/>\nturn it off or leave. <br/>\n   Anyways, thanks for listening.  I&#39;m sorry if we conjured up <br/>\nthoughts in peoples&#39; minds of a horrible family with poor, unloved <br/>\nchildren.                    <br/>\n                                     Judi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22943,"nextTopicId":22990}}
