I love them<br/>\nto be comfy with their bodies. I get annoyed when the kids start interacting<br/>\nwith eachother and the exposed body parts. 2.5 knows only that 5.5 makes her<br/>\nlaugh. She thinks it fun to copy him, so they run around sticking bottoms up<br/>\nin the air at eachother laughing hystically. I do ask that they  take private<br/>\nmatters to a private spot. I have yet to talk about masterbation. I do say<br/>\nit&#39;s ok to explore your body, in your own space, like your room or bathroom. I<br/>\ntell them to keep their privates private, which they get in public. It&#39;s at<br/>\nhome they go cookoo. I do try to make it a non issue, I just don&#39;t react well<br/>\nwhen I walk into a room and 5.5 is sniffing 2.5, or 5.5 is pulling back his<br/>\nforskin to show 2.5. Or 5.5 strutts down the hall with said body part out<br/>\nchasing dd8. Like I said, it&#39;s the interaction of the two that gets to me.<br/>\nThanks to all you moms for sharing your boy stories. Anyone out ther dealt<br/>\nwith this particular issue?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9207,"nextTopicId":9148}}
