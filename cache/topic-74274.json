It can help to step back a bit from &quot;rights&quot; and think about ways to be kind and gracious, approachable and generous - not just from your own perspective, but from the perspective of the people around you. From Your perspective, calling you by first name makes you kind and approachable. But if that&#39;s not the norm, if it&#39;s something odd and uncouth, then you&#39;re Not making yourself approachable, you&#39;re ungraciously demanding that people treat you differently. &nbsp;You&#39;re being a bit of a cultural elitist.&nbsp;<br><br><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;<span style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);\">&nbsp;Where we live almost all of the other homeschoolers are proud &quot;rigorous academic over achievers&quot; (their words!). &lt;&lt;<br><br> </span></span></blockquote>You&#39;ve only been there a year. It can take longer than that to find the right niche in a new community, especially when you&#39;re a minority of a minority. It may be that the local homeschooling community isn&#39;t the right niche for you - it&#39;s not for me, where I live. It&#39;s split between fervent religious homeschoolers and back-to-the-land, technology rots the mind types. So getting together for homeschooling purposes doesn&#39;t work so well, but socializing with people for other reasons does - especially as my kids have gotten older and developed distinct interests. Nowadays I don&#39;t look for &quot;homeschoolers&quot; locally, I look for people who share my kids&#39; interests. Some are school kids. Some are adults.

It sounds like those kids already have 99 problems in their heads.  You don&#39;t need to be one of them.</div>\n<div><br></div><div>Warmly,</div><div><br></div><div>Sylvia (Gabriella 9 &amp; Harry 7)</div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-460634756gmail_extra\"><br><br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-460634756gmail_quote\">On Mon, May 19, 2014 at 10:59 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:melissagray808@...\">melissagray808@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] <span dir=\"ltr\">&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>\n<blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-460634756gmail_quote\" style=\"margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;\">\n\n\n<u></u>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n<div style=\"background-color:#fff;\">\n<span> </span>\n\n\n<div>\n  <div>\n\n\n    <div>\n      \n      \n      <p>I am in the northeast.<br><br>I have gathered from your response that this is my issue, and not an unschooling issue at all.  As, I do not have another group to go to, we will just have to abide by their rules and customs.  Guess I&#39;ll just have to suck it up and do my best to smile and go with the flow.</p>\n\n\n    </div>\n     \n\n    \n    <div style=\"color:#fff;min-height:0;\"></div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div></div></blockquote></div><br></span></blockquote></div>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Phony hierarchy","postDate":"1400512688","msgId":74280,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc5NDkyRjk5LTRFOEYtNEY0Qy04RkQyLTYwQzJGMkQyMDhCNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGxsZDY4YSsxZnUwcTNsQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGxsZDJpZCsxOXZ2OHQwQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPDBENzAyQzk4LUY3MkQtNDRFNy1CMTdELTYyQjFGRkI5QTZBN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPGxsZDY4YSsxZnUwcTNsQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":74279,"nextInTopic":74281,"prevInTime":74279,"nextInTime":74281,"topicId":74274,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- As, I do not have another group to go to, we will just have to abide by their rules and customs.
