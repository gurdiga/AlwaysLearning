I told him that I would compromise and he could do a <br/>\n&gt; curriculum with him. I am not sure I can force myself to do it, <br/>\n&gt; something I always hated with my older children when I <br/>\n&gt; homeschooled them. Forcing them to do something they were very <br/>\n&gt; unhappy doing.<br/>\n&gt; Our biggest issue is dissapline and lack there of. I want to work <br/>\n&gt; with the kids to accomplish our goals and he feels that we are the <br/>\n&gt; parents and that means do what we say. He also hates that I dont <br/>\n&gt; make them do chores anymore. One day my 5 year old was acting up <br/>\n&gt; and he said &quot;I know mommy doesnt want me to spank you but if you <br/>\n&gt; dont stop I m going to spank you anyways.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; Truck driving he drives for Fedex Frieght and so it is not an <br/>\n&gt; option to come with him. He gets home on a saturday day or night <br/>\n&gt; and then has to go out Sunday night. He can take 34hours yet he <br/>\n&gt; wants to make the money and because he is not on a set run he is <br/>\n&gt; at their mercy for assignments.<br/>\n&gt; I have desperately tried to comprise but he just tells me that is <br/>\n&gt; not good enough &quot;we need to be on the same page with everything <br/>\n&gt; has parents. I try so hard to not talk or say anything schooling <br/>\n&gt; or nondisapline,  just hoping the will just work it out over time <br/>\n&gt; but he says we need to talk and agree with things now and then as <br/>\n&gt; hard as I try to talk peacefully but then we just end up making it <br/>\n&gt; personal. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for your help,<br/>\n&gt; Peace,<br/>\n&gt; Darlene<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; NANCY OWENS &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nancy-owens@...\">nancy-owens@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Darlene Navarre &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dknbhn@...\">dknbhn@...</a>&gt; wrote: <br/>\n&gt; ***I am new to unschooling and alternative non disciplinarian <br/>\n&gt; approaches yet I am a total believer and practice being peaceful <br/>\n&gt; and loving to everyone especially my children.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He tells me I better not fail his babies and that he will read my <br/>\n&gt; full of shit books but that does not mean he will ever agree.*** <br/>\n&gt; OUCH! I think you will only have to give him his time. Be as <br/>\n&gt; peaceful and loving to him as you are to the kids. Tell him his <br/>\n&gt; words really hurt though.

I have told him that I know and feel that this is the true <br/>\n&gt; way to raise children, out of love and respect. For the past <br/>\n&gt; couple of days he is threatening divorce. This is something I do <br/>\n&gt; not want especially for my children, they would be devastated, <br/>\n&gt; they all think the world of him and so do I.

You can continue to be a wonderful parent. Get <br/>\n&gt; some counseling (gonna be hard with him being a trucker. I know <br/>\n&gt; mine is too.), work on the issues that are behind his feelings, <br/>\n&gt; and yours too, about unschooling, about life. Try to ease into it <br/>\n&gt; slowly, jumping in both feet first is going to be a shock for him <br/>\n&gt; and you too. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He is out there worried about his load. Does he have enough hours <br/>\n&gt; to drive? What does the load pay? What is the cost of fuel? Can he <br/>\n&gt; fudge that 34hr. restart? Is he going to have to throw chains? Is <br/>\n&gt; he going to get home to you and the kids?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Are you adding to his worries by insisting things change right <br/>\n&gt; now, when he has no time to adjust?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Let him know there are others out their just like him. Darin and I <br/>\n&gt; took the kids with us for a year. The kids were on the truck for a <br/>\n&gt; total of seven months last year. They spent time off, visiting <br/>\n&gt; family, we didn&#39;t think it was fair to keep them on the truck all <br/>\n&gt; the time. But tell him to look around at the next few truck stops. <br/>\n&gt; Not all of those guys have the kids on the truck for just this <br/>\n&gt; load. Some live on that truck. I met at least 20 other families <br/>\n&gt; last year, with kids from just born to teenagers on the truck with <br/>\n&gt; them. I&#39;m NOT suggesting you load up with him and the kids, just <br/>\n&gt; suggesting that he look around and see that there are <br/>\n&gt; nontraditional families out there, and he can see them even on the <br/>\n&gt; road. ;o)And he can talk to them too. I did. I never found another <br/>\n&gt; unschooling family, but I found plenty of homeschooling folks, and <br/>\n&gt; I think I might have changed one families thoughts. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not trying to tell you not to unschool. I am trying to help <br/>\n&gt; you see where your dh is coming from, and see that he needs some <br/>\n&gt; adjustment time, some deschooling time, too. He&#39;s gone most of the <br/>\n&gt; week, or longer, when he comes home he wants normalcy, comfort, <br/>\n&gt; not a challenge. Take it slowly, baby steps.

Having a good marriage <br/>\nis good and the best for your children, and you should do that 100%.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize this and I have offered to compromise and he says no we need to be on the same page about everything. It is not that he wants our 5 year old to go to school he just wants me to use curriculum and I asked him if he would like to use curriculum then he could when he was home. For heaven sakes he is only 5. I honestly do not shove it down his throat and its not the unschooling or wasnt I should say because at first he said it sounded good. It is more the non disapline I am not doing all I asked of him was that we do not spank or verbally abuse the kids which he said that he ageed with and then a week later spanked my 5 year old (I said nothing).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- I have told him that I know and feel that this is the true way to raise <br/>\nchildren-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe true way!?<br/>\nThe One-True-Way?<br/>\n<br/>\nYour inflexibility isn&#39;t good for the situation.   It sounds more hostile <br/>\nthan persuasive.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has become hostile, you are correct and verbally bloody and hateful. I offer flexibility and for some reason that is not good enough. <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-This is something I do not want especially for my children, they would be <br/>\ndevastated-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nNO SHIT.<br/>\nIt would be better to put them in SCHOOL than to have a divorce, but those <br/>\naren&#39;t your only options.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is not asking for my 5 year old to go to school but yet he wants school at home and me to do it. I said I do do a lot of reading and games and puzzles and etc with them and that is learing. He agrees one minuete and then insists that making him do work books and such is not that bad and wont hurt him and making him read wont hurt him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-they all think the world of him and so do I.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nApparently you don&#39;t.   You shut him out of what you were doing and gave him <br/>\nan ultimatum, it sounds like, and not in a very loving or gentle way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have never given him an ultimatum it is he that keeps threatening divorce and it does not seem to matter what I say whether its compromise or work things out it  seems not to please him no matter what I say even lovingly. <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I don&#39;t know how to help him &quot;see the light&quot;.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he can&#39;t see it from the kids&#39; happiness and if he can&#39;t see them <br/>\nlearning, there IS no light.   If it&#39;s &quot;the light&quot; it will be glowing out of all of <br/>\nyou.<br/>\nI only wish he could look for it or her it out of our excitement about what we are doing and how much fun learning is and maybe this is what is truely bothering him that he is not here very much and maybe he is envious. I did ask him this but he says its not true but then I dont think he would give me an honest answer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-He has agreed to counseling for he and I yet he works all the time (truck <br/>\ndriver gone 6 to 7 days a week). I know this is a personal issue for him yet I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know what to do to help him?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n#1, how&#39;s your sex life?   Midlife frustrations and being gone 6 to 7 days a <br/>\nweek... bad combination.   Try to arrange for the kids to be gone and the <br/>\ncandles to be lit when he&#39;s coming home, and don&#39;t tell him what&#39;s leaking or <br/>\nbroken or anything about kids for an hour or two.   SERIOUSLY.   Forget all else <br/>\nif you don&#39;t think that&#39;s important.<br/>\n<br/>\nThats the one thing that has been great and more than usual. I am always a willing party it is usually he that is never up to it. During all this turmoil this past 2 months our sex life has defenantly been more frequent and great.<br/>\n<br/>\n#2, this is not a personal issue for him.    If you insist that it&#39;s all his <br/>\nproblem and none of yours, you&#39;re deluding yourself right into a divorce, and <br/>\nwith that divorce might come a court order to put your kids in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour right, it is not only his problem, its just that I just went through some major counceling and forgiveness work myself and I have just learned to truely love myself and I have never felt better. Even the mean things he says lastly I dont take personal (like I use to). Lately he&#39;s been talking about being a failure to our family and how badly he screwed up and how unhappy he is with himself and our 2 older children (17 year old with job and 14 year having fun choosing to go to high school getting all A and B except one D). I keep letting him know that I love him unconditionaly and I dont believe those things are mistakes just learning what worked and what doesnt. I am not sure if he even hears me. <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Thank you for any advise you could offer to help me weather the storm.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you seen The Truman Show?<br/>\nTurn off the storm machine.<br/>\nCue the sun.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nThank You,<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\n<br/>\nDarlene<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSPONSORED LINKS <br/>\nUnschooling Attachment parenting John holt Parenting magazine Single parenting <br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYAHOO!

I know this is a personal issue for him yet I don&#39;t know what to do to help him?<br/>\n <br/>\nThank you for any advise you could offer to help me weather the storm.<br/>\n <br/>\nPeace and Love,<br/>\nDarlene<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Yahoo!
