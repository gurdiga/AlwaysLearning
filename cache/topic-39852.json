He thought that was interesting and I thought it might be<br/>\ninteresting to people here as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/1999/math-0512.html\">http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/1999/math-0512.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt also reminded me of a story that I remembered about Enrico Fermi,<br/>\nwho was a very accomplished physicist, walking into a freshman physics<br/>\nclass and asking them how many piano tuners there are in Chicago.  He<br/>\nends up answering the question with a series of reasonable estimates<br/>\n(how many people are in Chicago, how many families, what proportion of<br/>\nthe families have pianos, how often they are tuned, how long it takes<br/>\nto tune a piano, how many hours a piano tuner would work in a year).<br/>\nAll of these were rough guesses based on reasonable assumptions but<br/>\nthey give you a good ballpark answer to a question that you would<br/>\nthink you<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of &quot;real world math&quot;, questions like this really do come up<br/>\n(e.g. how many seeds are in the pomegranate that we are eating) but I<br/>\ncan see it being very easy not to have an answer as this isn&#39;t how<br/>\nschools teach math and may not be how many adults are used to looking<br/>\nat the world this way.<br/>\n<br/>\na book of essays, one of which has this story: (The Fermi Solution)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Fermi-Solution-Hans-Christian-Baeyer/dp/0486417077\">http://www.amazon.com/Fermi-Solution-Hans-Christian-Baeyer/dp/0486417077</a><br/>\nan article about it:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://physics.suite101.com/article.cfm/fermi_problems_physics_estimation\">http://physics.suite101.com/article.cfm/fermi_problems_physics_estimation</a><br/>\n<br/>\nFor some reason, it also reminds me (looser commection) to the<br/>\nstatistics story about the lady tasting tea. That is another nice<br/>\nstory and there is a book meant for the general public that has that<br/>\nstory as well as other stories about statistics.
