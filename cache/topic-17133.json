I did talk to my mil this morning <br/>\nand at first she got all defensive and then after awhile she talked more <br/>\ncalmly, but she&#39;s still very upset.  She continued to defend my sil as a <br/>\npoor, overworked single parent and to defend my niece as the poor only <br/>\nchild of divorced parents.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love my niece and do <br/>\nfeel sorry for her, but not enough for my children to suffer.  I learned <br/>\nalso from my mil that my sil is very upset because my oldest, Aislinn, <br/>\n7, is rude to her.  I&#39;ve talked to Aislinn about that and explained that <br/>\nshe can choose to behave as she wishes to all people but she has to <br/>\nrealize that there will always be consequences and sometimes they won&#39;t <br/>\nbe pleasant.  So part of all this could be consequences coming back to <br/>\nhaunt her.<br/>\n<br/>\nNews Flash!  I just left this e-mail hanging here and had a long talk <br/>\nwith the girls and we&#39;ve figured out a way that they can go to Nani&#39;s <br/>\nand hardly ever, dare I say never, get into trouble for anything!  I <br/>\ntold them that whenever there was an upset, an arguement, or whatever <br/>\nbetween them and their cousin or even each other- they should run to <br/>\nNani and say in a very sweet voice, &quot;Nani, we need YOUR help.  We want <br/>\neveryone to be happy.  What should we do?&quot;  This way Nani gets to feel <br/>\nimportant, the problem will get somewhat solved, and nobody can ever say <br/>\nthat the girls were bad.  LOL.  It might made them seem like <br/>\ngoody-two-shoes, but it will solve their problem in an honest way <br/>\nwithout accusations or blame being placed on anyone.  I would like them <br/>\nto learn how to solve these confrontations in a fair and calm way, so <br/>\nmaybe this will help with that.  If not, at least it will take the heat <br/>\nof them for a little while.  In the last couple hours, we&#39;ve been <br/>\npracticing it with problems they&#39;ve been having with each other, and <br/>\nthey are solving them on there own in ways that will make &#39;everyone <br/>\nhappy.&#39;  I even called my mil and told her this and she&#39;s thrilled and <br/>\nsays she&#39;ll help Alexis learn how to do this, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAND, dh called this morning from work to apologize for his attitude last <br/>\nnight.  That&#39;s a HUGE step for him because he is a lot like his mom, who <br/>\nnever want to admits she&#39;s wrong.  I really didn&#39;t want to call off the <br/>\ndate.  I never really get to see him anymore and he&#39;s going through a <br/>\nreally hard time in his life.  Sandra&#39;s right, I think husbands, <br/>\nespecially mine, need to treated gently.  And I think he feels a little <br/>\njealous that I&#39;m so focused on the kids.  I ask him about what&#39;s going <br/>\non at work, but we have 4 little kids, and he never gets more than 2 <br/>\nsentences out before we&#39;re interupted and I have to leave to go help <br/>\nsomeone.  He&#39;s under so much stress that I&#39;ve been worried a lot about <br/>\nhis health because of it and he NEEDS a night out to see a movie or <br/>\nsomething.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I feel so much better.  I strongly feel that there&#39;s almost <br/>\nalways a solution if you really work at it.  And I think that this will <br/>\nwork.  And the girls feel good about it too.  Nani feels good about it. <br/>\n Things look pretty good all around.

I hear afterward from my oldest that one of the moms was<br/>\nmean to my 10yo, shaking her finger in his face and yelling at him for<br/>\nplaying with a volleyball in the gym.

I question and<br/>\nshe says that the coke machine was open and the little 4 year olds were<br/>\nmessing with it.  Zach (10) was trying to get it to stay shut when a mom<br/>\ncame in and started yelling at him about the rules.  He tried to explain and<br/>\nshe cut him off and then apparently went and complained about my kids.

You have many years for dates, when <br/>\nyour own children are old enough to stay with each other, or when they <br/>\nare out of the house.  Right now, my focus is my children, their needs <br/>\nwhile they are small and need me so much.  It will come all too soon <br/>\nthat my children will need me less and I can do what I want. <br/>\n<br/>\nLetting children cry in a crib is abusive, in my opinion.  Not letting <br/>\nchildren call their mother is also abusive.  I also am deciding that I <br/>\nno longer believe in Time Out, at least not in the way most people do <br/>\nit.  I did put a sixth grader in time out today at the halloween dance, <br/>\nas I had warned him about five time sthat he needed to settle down and <br/>\nstop running through the crowds of kids, but basically I just simply <br/>\nwalked him outside and asked him to take a few minutes and then he could <br/>\ncome back into the dance.  He just needed a break from the action.  It <br/>\nwasn&#39;t punitive, it was a break.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you might need to have a long talk with your husband <br/>\nabout how you wish to parent your children, because what you describe <br/>\nyour mil doing is not respectful parenting, and if your husband really <br/>\nis going along with it, and doesn&#39;t respect your kids and their needs <br/>\nand opinions, then he is also not practicing loving and respectful <br/>\nparenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, just saying it like I see it, based on your description below. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\nbadolbilz wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi everyone.

So for almost all of the last 6 months we&#39;ve been together.<br/>\n&gt; They never would really go anywhere anyway, except to their<br/>\n&gt; grandparents houses while dh and I went on a date.  Now, my mom is okay<br/>\n&gt; if the girls say they want to go home or whatever, but my mil just won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; let them call me if they feel they need to.

Also, with my baby who&#39;s always slept with me and the older<br/>\n&gt; girls, when she&#39;s with mil and she starts to cry, my mil puts in a crib<br/>\n&gt; upstairs and tries to just leave her there.

My mom also said she wanted the girls.  Dh said they HAVE<br/>\n&gt; to go to his mom&#39;s and that they should just learn that sometimes they<br/>\n&gt; have to go where they don&#39;t want to.

The way he sees it is that they <br/>\nkids and they&#39;ll just have to work it out themselves.  Obviously I don&#39;t <br/>\nfeel that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI talked to the girls a lot about it tonight.  I was worried they <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t want their Nani to know about things they&#39;ve told me.  But they <br/>\nsaid I could tell her.  It really does come down to my niece.  But up <br/>\nuntil last weekend, I never had a really strong case to argue because I <br/>\nwas never there when things happened.  But last Sunday, my mil asked me <br/>\nto watch my niece so that she and my sil could paint some rooms in her <br/>\nnew house.  BTW, sil is divorced and very aggressive, spiteful, and full <br/>\nof woe for herself (not just because of her life now, she&#39;s just always <br/>\nbeen that way.)  Anyway, the whole day, Alexis (niece) kept telling <br/>\nSoleille (my 3 yr old) that she couldn&#39;t play with them because they <br/>\nwere only playing &quot;big girl&quot; games.  I had to keep telling her, &quot;no, in <br/>\nthis house everybody gets to play.&quot;  So after Alexis went home, I find <br/>\nout that she told my sil that  she was a bad mom because she smoked. <br/>\n When asked where she heard that she said, &quot;AZ&quot; meaning Aislinn, my 7 yr <br/>\nold.  Well, of course my mil and sil just believed her and I KNOW it <br/>\nwasn&#39;t true because I was with them all day.  Anyway... I&#39;m going to <br/>\ntalk to her tomorrow as tactfully as I can.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as dh goes,  he&#39;s never been really all that interested in the <br/>\ngirls and I never even asked him how he felt about my homeschooling and <br/>\nthen unschooling.  We&#39;ve talked about it a bit here and there but I just <br/>\nfeel like if he&#39;s not interested why should I have to ask him or discuss <br/>\nit with him.  Oh, I&#39;m just wandering of the subject now...sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway thanks for the advice.  Anyone know how to convince a mil to <br/>\nchange?  According to my dh, she&#39;s always used a time-out chair.  I did <br/>\ntell my two older girls that if she put Soleille in the time-out chair, <br/>\nthey should just go sit with her and if Nani told them they had to <br/>\nleave, they should just say no and if she got mad, they could say, &quot; <br/>\nsee, we&#39;re being bad too so we need to be in time-out.&quot;  At least then <br/>\nSoleille wouldn&#39;t have to be there all alone.  Also, and ironically, my <br/>\nsil used to always get my dh in trouble for things he didn&#39;t do.
