He was black, but had no dialect whatsoever, and<br/>\ncontinually experienced surprise from people he&#39;d spoken to on the phone<br/>\nwhen he showed up in person and was black.  The reason for he and his<br/>\nbrother&#39;s nonexistent dialect was that his mother had told both boys<br/>\nwhen they were children that they must work on speaking with a more<br/>\n&quot;white&quot; dialect so they would be discriminated against less as adults by<br/>\nwhite people.  Funny thing about this was that both boys grew up to<br/>\nmarry white women, and then their mom was furious that they married<br/>\noutside their race!  I always thought that was pretty funny.  Be careful<br/>\nwhat you wish for!  G<br/>\n <br/>\nLaurel in Burke, VA<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: SandraDodd@...
