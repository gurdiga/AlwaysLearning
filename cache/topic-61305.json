Those could be fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nMo loved stencils when she was 4-5 and wanted to write but couldn&#39;t make the letters independently. I haven&#39;t seen stencils for cursive, but if you&#39;re handy you can make stencils - look in craft and fabric shops for the supplies or you can make simple ones with posterboard and a razor blade. For that matter, if you look in the quilting and home decor sections you&#39;ll find stencils of loops and waves, although the loops are awkward to trace as they&#39;re all broken up to keep the stencil together. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s also a kind of doodling that she might enjoy, where you draw random lines without lifting your pen or pencil. I think of it as an exercise for machine-quilters, since that&#39;s what I do ;) and you may find good ideas if you look in quilting books under &quot;fill patterns&quot;. All over squiggles, wave patterns, and loops are standard fill patterns, and they&#39;re fun to draw, too and then go back and color. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever you do, it could help to start Big rather than small, although that will depend a lot on your daughter. But if she likes get her some big paper or a big dry-erase board where she can draw giant loops and waves and great big letters.
