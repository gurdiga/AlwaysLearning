Send balloons with <br/>\nmessages tied to them towards the heavens.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as finances goes,  reach out to loved ones for help, your <br/>\nchurch or a church.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI really like the idea of finding someone who homeschools and would <br/>\nbe willing to *homeschool* your kids while you work part time and <br/>\nthen you could return the favor.  I have often thought about what I <br/>\nwould do if my husband passed away.  I think that is what I would try <br/>\nto do. I have a single friend who has two kids and she just left her <br/>\njob to homeschool her boys.  She has lived off of her summer public <br/>\nschool salary, used up all of her retirement money, and is hunting <br/>\ndesperately for a part time job.  Meanwhile she is living with a <br/>\nfriend, turns to her church for help with groceries, and gives back <br/>\nto these people in anyway she can.... watching thier kids, cleaning <br/>\nthe church building and etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLet us know how things are going.  How old are your kids?  Could they <br/>\nbe trusted to stay home alone?  <br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Alicia, I&#39;m so sorry for your loss.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I&#39;m sorry that Idon&#39;t really have any helpful ideas.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  I wouldn&#39; suggest any drastic changes right away<br/>\n&gt; either.

But that was always given to people who had life insurance  money.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI understand that things are weighing in on you, and the bills won&#39;t  wait.  <br/>\nThere is an urgency to having bills to pay that&#39;s just  unbelievable.<br/>\n <br/>\nHowever, I think the important thing is to keep your family together.   I <br/>\nthink music lessons and the like can wait.  I think this is an  opportunity for <br/>\nyou and your kids to be more creative thinkers.  I really  hate the idea of you <br/>\ngoing to work full-time with a long commute.   Hate it.  It&#39;s going to be sad <br/>\nand hard and will be trading off way too  much.  Your kids lost their father, <br/>\nand now they&#39;ll lose the presence of  their mom, too?  There have to be other <br/>\noptions.<br/>\n <br/>\nCan you sell your house and move in somewhere cheaper?  Your kids are  big <br/>\nenough that they can go to a park, instead of needing a big yard.   Maybe you <br/>\ncould move into a low-maintenance townhouse or something like  that?   I like <br/>\nthat your son is willing to work.  Moving into  town might make that more <br/>\npossible.<br/>\n <br/>\nCould you take in more kids for longer hours?  Maybe a couple of  <br/>\nmothers-day-out toddlers from 9-12?  <br/>\n <br/>\nDon&#39;t forget government services.  Your situation is what they&#39;re  there for. <br/>\n No shame in it.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy heart is aching for you and your situation.

(It&#39;s what I worry about when I do my<br/>\nmiddle of the night worrying.)  My heart goes out to you.  Any advice<br/>\nI give you is intended to be evaluated by you and only acted on if it<br/>\nsuits you.  I won&#39;t try to talk you into anything that doesn&#39;t sound<br/>\nright to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of where Danny worked and because he had a narrow escape from<br/>\nthe Pentagon on 9/11/2001, I was always afraid that he would die<br/>\nyoung.  I am glad that I always took the time to send him off with<br/>\nsweet words and good wishes -- because you never know, right?  It just<br/>\nso happened that he did die on his way to work -- and I am really <br/>\nglad that my policy of happy morning departures was in effect on our<br/>\nlast moring together.  Try not to spend too much time worrying about<br/>\nwhat you can&#39;t control -- and focus on the things that you can<br/>\ncontrol.  I wish I had spent more time learning Dan&#39;s method of bill<br/>\npaying, paid attention when he told me his computer passwords, and<br/>\nfollowed through on his instructions to get his life insurance<br/>\ndoubled.  Because the thought of losing him was too terrible for me to<br/>\nconfront, I put it off and now it&#39;s too late.  Since Dan was getting<br/>\nto be in his forties and we&#39;ve had friends who&#39;ve already had cardiac<br/>\nswcares, I had mentioned to him that he should see a doctor to get a<br/>\nbaseline physical.  Now I wish that I&#39;d jsut made the appointment and<br/>\nencouraged him to go.  For me it&#39;s a point game of coulda shoulda<br/>\nwoulda -- but if my experience can be instructive that is my advice to<br/>\nyou. :-&gt;            <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; You may qualify for types of health care offered in your state for<br/>\n </span></blockquote>poor people, now that your income is much smaller.  (A family that I<br/>\nknow that went through prolonged unemployment, in CA, was able to put<br/>\ntheir kids on a new state program.)  You may want to research what&#39;s<br/>\navailable in your state or get a friend who wants to help to research<br/>\nit for you.  (But double check what they tell you.)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I work in the social services field - and having advised many people<br/>\nof their qualications for these programs, this is one of the first<br/>\nthings I checked for myself.  Unfortunately, with Social Security, our<br/>\nhousehold income is just slightly too high to qualify.  That may<br/>\nchange and you bet I will be watchful for when it does.       <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you have to go back to work full-time, you can probably find ways<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to have your kids spend some of their day with friends.  I would<br/>\nencourage you to try not to feel bad if you look at your options and<br/>\nfigure that full-time work is necessary.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks -- that is good to hear.  I have lots of friends in this area<br/>\n-- a huge support network, actually.  Most of my non-homeschooling<br/>\nfriends are older, wealthier and dote on my children.  They&#39;re taking<br/>\nthem to the movies, out for pizza and ice cream, etc.  They&#39;ve offered<br/>\nto take them on fields trips and help ferry them to places during the<br/>\nday if I need to be away.  I just don&#39;t want to be an imposition.    <br/>\n       <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt; Some people find that selling a house and moving to a cheaper area<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is a workable way to deal with having less income.  But, of course,<br/>\nyou are urged not to do anything drastic in your year of mourning when<br/>\nit&#39;s darned hard to think clearly.  It&#39;s just something to consider.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve thought about this a bit too.  Right now -- all of my family and<br/>\nfriends are in this area -- if I moved, I wouldn&#39;t have the same kind<br/>\nof support network that I have here.  Moving is a fantasy -- I could<br/>\ncash in all my equity, take the insurance payment and move to Costa<br/>\nRica! Or Canada (free health care!)     <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Could you work for the state government instead of the Federal<br/>\n </span></blockquote>government? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s possible.  I am about halfway betweeen DC and Richmond.  I&#39;m<br/>\nwilling to entertain all possiblities at this point. I also have some<br/>\nleads with two national labor unions -- but those are in DC.  There is<br/>\nalso an interesting lead with PBS -- and they&#39;re located in<br/>\nAlexandria, VA which is not as bad as going all the way into DC --<br/>\nabout 45 minutes as opposed to 1.5 hours.       <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for all the good things to think about.

You&#39;re right about the less<br/>\nscheduled lives with fewer lessons.  My children do tend to like their<br/>\nday to unfold more slowly and there were time when they expressed that<br/>\nthere was too much going on. It was all of their own choosing -- but I<br/>\nnever felt the need to limit their participation in lessons, clubs,<br/>\netc.  There are other, less spendy ways for them to gain enrichment. <br/>\nAfter we talked about taking a break from thier Sunday music lessons,<br/>\nwe found that there was an SCA group that did medieval weapons<br/>\nactivities on Sunday -- and AFAIK, SCA is very low-cost or free.

I&#39;ve been thinking that if I can<br/>\nkeep things fairly status quo for the next year -- that will give us<br/>\nmore time to decide our course for the future as well as give the kids<br/>\none more year to mature and become more self-reliant.  Right now I&#39;m<br/>\nthinking that I can keep the house since the mortgage is less than<br/>\nmost rental properties in my area (real estate values are astronomical<br/>\n in metro Washington, DC.)  The next biggest expense is health care --<br/>\nand if I can get a job that pays for that we will be much better off.<br/>\n   There is a small chance the job I currently hold will get some<br/>\nhealth benefits.

Things will probably hit later that haven&#39;t yet,<br/>\nfor you and the  kids both.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t found the grief counseling sewrvices in our area yet.<br/>\nHospice is the most likely place to have that information.  Come to<br/>\nthink of it, I am surprised that the funeral home didn&#39;t provide me<br/>\nwith a list of those resources.  Hmmm... I will have to ping them on<br/>\nthat.  We had a rather unorthodox approach to the death service.  When<br/>\nI returned from the hospital after getting the news about Dan&#39;s death,    <br/>\nand after I told the boys what happened, the three of us sat down and<br/>\ndiscussed how we wanted the arrangements to be.  Right away it was<br/>\nclear to the three of us that we didn&#39;t want a burial, so we chose<br/>\ncremation and decided to keep Dan&#39;s remains at home with us.  We<br/>\nplanned a memorial celebration of his life with input from family and<br/>\nfriends. There was a very ecumenical approach drawing from the<br/>\ntraditions of many faiths -- Christianity, Judaism, Islam and Pagan. <br/>\n    We did this to provide comfort to the various members of our<br/>\nfamilies  who follow those faiths.  The memorial was a good creative<br/>\noutlet to our grieving, and that was very healing.  Dan&#39;s sister, the<br/>\nboys and I had a great time making a CD of Dan&#39;s favorite music which<br/>\nwas played at the beginning and at the end of the memorial.  It may be<br/>\nthe first (and only?) time that Pink Floyd&#39;s &quot;The Wall&quot; was ever<br/>\nplayed at the funeral home!  We burned multiple copies of Dan&#39;s Music<br/>\nCD to give to family members as tokens of remembrance.  A day after<br/>\nthe &quot;traditional&quot; memorial we had a Pagan ceremony of release and<br/>\nhealing planned by some dear homeschooling friends in a wonderful<br/>\nsetting near an old forest and river.                      <br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that grief is a process that unfolds in its own time and<br/>\nin its own way for each of us.  With the kids I definitely think that<br/>\nthere will be a delayed reaction that comes up later on.  Roger had<br/>\nsome delayed reactions to his grandfather&#39;s death a few years ago. <br/>\nWhat I keep hearing from both of the boys is that they want to be<br/>\nstrong for me.  I tell them that it&#39;s good that they want to be strong<br/>\nand grown-up, but that I don&#39;t want them to supress what they are<br/>\nfeeling -- it&#39;s not only okay, but the best thing they can do is to<br/>\nallow themselves to feel their feelings.  Right now, they report that<br/>\nthey&#39;re still in a state of disbelief -- that they feel that Dan is<br/>\njust away on a long trip and will be returning soon.  Of course, they<br/>\nknow that this is not true and we talk about how this shock and<br/>\nnumbness is a protective   coping reaction to give our brains time to<br/>\nprocess this great sadness. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your support and sympathy, <br/>\nAlicia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Ideas for suddenly widowed  unschooling mom","postDate":"1105382318","msgId":21410,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQ3RDc4RUU4LTYzMzYtMTFEOS04MTY0LTAwMEE5NTdFRkU0NkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQxRTJBNDdGLjkwMTA0MDRAc2JjZ2xvYmFsLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGNycnAzNit1am42QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NDFFMjA3ODguNzA0MDFAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4gPDQxRTJBNDdGLjkwMTA0MDRAc2JjZ2xvYmFsLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":21403,"nextInTopic":21414,"prevInTime":21409,"nextInTime":21411,"topicId":21378,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Your email shows that you indeed<br/>\nare a strong, smart, caring woman!<br/>\n<br/>\nI had numerous thoughts while reading your post. Though my husband is still<br/>\nwith us, we had a similar change in our financial situation. My husband is a<br/>\nphysician, and two years ago merged his clinic in Ohio with one in Phoenix<br/>\nArizona, which caused us to move across the country to Phoenix (we did it<br/>\nhappily, and in excited agreement). The move business-wise was a huge<br/>\nmistake (if you believe in mistakes) and he lost not only his income, but<br/>\nall of his clinic assets as well in what turned out to be a big con job<br/>\n(lots of court proceedings in process, but this is costing money rather than<br/>\nreplenishing any, and it looks like we&#39;ll get nothing back). It&#39;s a long<br/>\nstory, but the end result is that we went from $200,000 income to $35,000.<br/>\nThis would be fine, except we were living at least a $150,000 life.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause my dh has worked in alternative cancer treatment for most of his<br/>\nworking years, he was not easily employable in a standard dr. position. We<br/>\nhave four kids, all in lessons, classes, etc like yours. Our mortgage was<br/>\nalso $3000, we had no health insurance except for one of our children who<br/>\nhas major heart problems and we pay $500 a month just for him. We had lots<br/>\nof other expenses as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt first we just felt devastated. We couldn&#39;t figure out what moves to make.<br/>\nBut slowly we realized that we had to make changes, and fast. We discussed a<br/>\nwhole lot as a family and to my dh&#39;s and my surprise, our children were much<br/>\nmore in touch with reality than we were. They pretty much said that though<br/>\nthey loved where we lived, they were much more interested in having a<br/>\npeaceful life. There certainly was some initial mourning to the changes, but<br/>\nnot for long. They excitedly took on the idea of selling our house and<br/>\ndownsizing.  We looked at all kinds of other places to live. They all ended<br/>\ntheir lessons and suddenly had more time and less schedule, which they<br/>\nenjoyed. We also creatively thought of ways to barter for lessons. In<br/>\nexchange for guitar lessons, we thought of bringing lunch three days a week<br/>\nto the teacher. I offered to volunteer at my daughter&#39;s dance studio in<br/>\nexchange for her lessons to continue. My son&#39;s film teacher donated his time<br/>\nindefinitely. People really do in general want to help when help is really<br/>\nneeded. Maybe some of your children&#39;s lessons can be donated or bartered for<br/>\ndue to this unfortunate circumstance?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat was very important to us was that we did not live beyond our means, and<br/>\nour means at the time meant changing everything. We were reminded so often<br/>\nof the important things, love, peace, relationships. These were so much more<br/>\nimportant than expensive stuff/house, lessons, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may be way too soon for you to consider making changes this way in your<br/>\nlife, but I thought I&#39;d share what happened with us in case it is helpful.<br/>\nYou have already been challenged enough in thinking about things in life!<br/>\nJust know that you don&#39;t have to &quot;fix&quot; everything right away, and in time<br/>\nthere will be ways to get lessons and things back. You are giving them a<br/>\nloving family environment and home, no matter what that home is. That is the<br/>\nprimary thing that any of us need. They&#39;ll have lots of opportunities to<br/>\ncontinue with what they want as time goes on.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot working outside the home much has been a very important thing for me<br/>\ntoo, but I have had to do some of that. My guys have spent more time home<br/>\nalone than I would like. I don&#39;t see a negative side yet, except for the<br/>\noccasional day that they want to do something and I can&#39;t do it for them.

We ve been","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1571863170\">Hi everyone -- Today I&#39;m sitting here on my computer -- and feeling<br/>\nenormously guilty because I am not taking my boys to their music<br/>\nlessons today.  We&#39;ve been unschooling for about three years.  The<br/>\nboys have also been taking outside lessons in art, swimming, fencing<br/>\nand music. Before our world shifted last month, they were also asking<br/>\nto take a video production class.           <br/>\n<br/>\nLong story short -- my 44-year-old husband died of a sudden massive<br/>\nheart attack on Dec. 14.  We&#39;ve gotten through the immediate shock,<br/>\nthe funeral and the holidays. Now we&#39;re looking at the future and how<br/>\nmuch our lives have changed and will change.  The financial part will<br/>\nbe tremendously tight -- we&#39;re falling from $100K a year to about $15K<br/>\nper year.  Out of that we&#39;ll have to pay about $3000 a month in bare<br/>\nbasics expenses -- mortgage, health insurance, utilities.  There is<br/>\nsome insurance and social security which will help out a little bit,<br/>\nbut now I am the sole support for our family.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLast night I spoke to the boys (ages 11 and 14) and shared with them<br/>\nmy concern that their outside lessons cost $100s a month. When we had<br/>\na lot more money, this was not a problem in the least.  They agreed<br/>\nthat most of the lessons were an expense that we needed to cut.  They<br/>\nare continuing with the swimming lessons for now since a benefactor<br/>\nhas volunteered to pay for the next 8 weeks.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI have always had an at-home child care business as well as a<br/>\npart-time job with a non-profit agency that allows me to work from<br/>\nhome.  These jobs allowed me to stay at home with my kids, and the<br/>\nmoney that I made was pretty much spent on food and fun stuff. Now I<br/>\nwill have to be the breadwinner and that gives rise to another concern<br/>\n-- the prospect of leaving my kids home alone for long stretches. <br/>\nRight now, my thought is to keep the status quo, pare back expenses<br/>\nand try to stay home with them for one more year.  I can try to get<br/>\nmore children enrolled in my before/after school child care and my<br/>\nagency has said that I can pick up a few more hours.  This will be<br/>\ngood for the short term, but this small amount of additional income<br/>\nwill not sustain our family in the long-run.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a previous career (12 years ago) I was a legislative aide to a US<br/>\nCongressman. If I were to return to DC to work either as a staffer or<br/>\nwith a lobbying firm, I would make a larger income and benefits would<br/>\nbe paid. (Right now our health insurance is $969 a month and because<br/>\nall three of us have asthma, we can&#39;t get individual-payer insurance<br/>\nanywhere else. The Federal Employees Health Benefits plan doesn&#39;t<br/>\nexclude pre-existing conditions.) The downside is that I would have a<br/>\n90 mile round trip commute, long daily hours and likely 25% travel.<br/>\n(I&#39;ve though a bit about the travel -- I could arrange to take the<br/>\nkids with me on some trips.) I&#39;m also looking into jobs working for my<br/>\ncounty -- the pay would be less, but all the benefits would be paid --<br/>\nand I would not have the 1.5 hour each way commute.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 14 year old son told me that he can&#39;t wait until he&#39;s 15 (which is<br/>\nnext month) because he wants to go out and get job to help support our<br/>\nfamily.  (I get all teary just thinking about how quickly he&#39;s having<br/>\nto grow up -- but OTH I am trying to think positively that his joining<br/>\nthe workforce to help pay our household bills will give him a valuable<br/>\nlife experience and a real sense of his effectiveness.) We live in a<br/>\nsemi-rural area with no sidewalks and busy roads that aren&#39;t safe to<br/>\nwalk -- so I would have to transport him to his job.  He already helps<br/>\nme a lot by being home with his younger brother on the days that I<br/>\nhave work meetings outside (about twice a week).              <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m looking for ideas and reassurances that we can continue our<br/>\nunschooling lifestyle even if it means that my kids are home alone all<br/>\nday long.    <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for your creatvitiy and wisdom,<br/>\n<br/>\nAlicia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7187,"nextTopicId":21365}}
