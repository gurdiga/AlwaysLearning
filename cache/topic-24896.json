Now with the  <br/>\nyoungest of the five headed toward 18 (hard to believe!) they are out in the  world <br/>\nand having a fine time. This is part of what I put at the end of a  monthly <br/>\ncolumn I have been writing:<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nMy oldest two sons attended school through the fourth  grade and <br/>\nkindergarten.  After that  none of the kids have gone to school until college.  My oldest <br/>\nson now works as real estate  agent, he holds an accounting degree, the next <br/>\none graduated with a degree in  theatre – he’s now attending grad school at <br/>\nUCLA, the next son works as a  journeyman in the heating/AC field, my daughter <br/>\nattends community college  majoring in dance and music, and the youngest son <br/>\nstarted taking a couple of  community college courses.  <br/>\nIn addition - my daughter is now  working two jobs.  She and three of her <br/>\nfriends have plans to start a dance  studio in the future.  My youngest son is in <br/>\nthe process of getting a job  bussing at a local restaurant. <br/>\nMostly what I would say about the kids  is that they are responsible, <br/>\nreliable and make choices in their lives that  benefit themselves and others around <br/>\nthem.  They learned to be  self-directed and have been very clear in what path <br/>\nthey want to take as they  enter their adult years. <br/>\nThe responses through the years from  their professors, their bosses, and <br/>\ntheir coaches have been glowing.   <br/>\nYesterday I had lunch with four women  from my original San Diego <br/>\nun/homeschooling group.  There is no doubt about  it, the kids have grown up to be happy, <br/>\ncaring people.   <br/>\nConnie <br/>\n_www.homeschoolingreflections.com_ (http://www.homeschoolingreflections.com) <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126518448,"authorName":"C Johnson","from":"C Johnson &lt;piscesmomx3@...&gt;","profile":"piscesmomx3","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] adult unschoolers","postDate":"1143311450","msgId":24906,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwMzI1MTgzMDUyLjUzMTU3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjMxODA0Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDYuMS4xLjEuMi4yMDA2MDMyNTEwMzExMi4wMWI4YzkxMEBpbmNvbWluZy52ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":24905,"nextInTopic":24914,"prevInTime":24905,"nextInTime":24907,"topicId":24896,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Here are some more links about adult unschoolers.

Usually they are at work all day, and some <br/>\ntime between kids and dinner moms are trying to have a conversation <br/>\nabout unschooling and they are trying to relate all the information <br/>\nthat they have learned ,researched, understand about unschooling and <br/>\nnow want to implement. So the struggle begins....Because your now <br/>\ntrying to not only convince your partner this is a viable option but <br/>\ninforming them of the concepts and ideas too. So you have already <br/>\nceased to have a equal discussion and now are on to convincing them <br/>\nyou know what your doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with this is, most times the husband do say yea do what <br/>\never. But then they come home every day and they are looking for <br/>\nschoolish type learning to have taken place if not physicality but at <br/>\nleast be able to observe the schoolish results in their children and <br/>\nthe kids demonstrating this to dad so he can be convinced all is <br/>\ngoing well.  When dads don&#39;t see the learning in the way they are <br/>\naccustom to observing, friction and conflict arise and your back to <br/>\nexplaining yet again the concept idea and what it looks like and <br/>\nconvincing them yes the children really are learning. This is very <br/>\nbad on the marriage and relationship for the whole family. You are <br/>\nalways being held up to scrutiny by the one person who is your <br/>\npartner and suppose to be supporting you if not fully involved in the <br/>\nunschooling process. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can answers the one question what do jobs look like for <br/>\nunschoolers and as far as I can tell they look like any one else&#39;s <br/>\njobs. Just the kids usually want to do it and like it and choose it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne might want to think about why he asked such a question. Does he <br/>\nhave ideas or visions that unschooler cannot accomplish what ever <br/>\ngoals they desire with love and support. Does he think that the kids <br/>\nwon&#39;t go on to getting graduate degrees in banking business computer <br/>\nhigh tech. Which unschoolers do accomplish. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe question I think you should be asking him, is he ok with whatever <br/>\ninterests the kids have and allowing them to follow their own path.  <br/>\nAre you and your husband ok with letting your children follow their <br/>\ndesires dreams and goals and supporting them in what ever direction <br/>\nthey choose.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think I could be unschooling if my husband didn&#39;t understand <br/>\nand respect the goals and interests of our son. It also helped a lot <br/>\nthat he took the time to finally read up and learn about unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also have your husband join some unschooling groups let him <br/>\nread the threads, send him articles and allow him the opportunity to <br/>\neducate himself on the radical unschooling subject. <br/>\n<br/>\nHey maybe even strew a few article and such around the house so he <br/>\ncan be on the same page as you.<br/>\nSome books I strewed around my house for my husband ( Who <br/>\nincidentally works for a private preparatory school  and sees these <br/>\nkids achievements on a daily basis like second languages in <br/>\nkindergarten writing essays in 1st grade) Oh yea we&#39;ve been there <br/>\nwith the comparisons and what kind of job and career will a <br/>\nunschooler really have. <br/>\nAny way here are some books I strewed around for him to read.

Both were offered their first  <br/>\njobs by adults who knew them and were impressed by them.  At the  <br/>\nmoment Kirby (19) is working at a pizza place where friends wanted  <br/>\nhim to come and work.  He visited the home of one of &quot;the pie  <br/>\nguys&quot; (who make the pizzas themselves) and there was a pharmacy  <br/>\nschool diploma on the wall.  Marty (17) is working full time at a  <br/>\ngrocery store.  Because he&#39;s not 18, he is a sacker/bagboy/&quot;courtesy  <br/>\nclerk and making $6 an hour.  That&#39;s not great, but there&#39;s already  <br/>\nbeen an inquiry from the manager of the deli about when he will turn  <br/>\n18 and be eligible for MANY other jobs there.  I doubt the deli  <br/>\nmanager will be the only one to ask.  He doesn&#39;t turn 18 until mid  <br/>\nJanuary.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby is interested in a culinary arts course given by the community  <br/>\ncollege, and that&#39;s his current plan.<br/>\nMarty has for several years intended to be a policeman.  Keith has  <br/>\nwanted me to discourage that.  Just Thursday my sister, who worked as  <br/>\na grocery store clerk for years, said I should tell him grocery  <br/>\nmanagement pays way better than policework and is safer.  Starting  <br/>\nthere at 16 as he did, he could be pretty far along by the time  <br/>\nothers his age get out of college with their degrees in anthropology,  <br/>\ncommunications, philosophy, politics, history or other things that  <br/>\nrequire a master&#39;s degree or PhD for even the HOPE of a paying job in  <br/>\nthe field.  Many BA and BS degrees &quot;qualify&quot; one for nothing more  <br/>\nthan continuing in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe ask your doubting husband to really inventory people he&#39;s know  <br/>\nin his life, or that he graduated with, or has worked with.  He  <br/>\nprobably will stop counting before very long about people with  <br/>\nsomething like  a master&#39;s in education who never taught or quit  <br/>\nafter fewer years in the classroom than they were in school, or  <br/>\npeople who dropped out of college after three years and had to pay  <br/>\ntheir student loans off (if indeed they bothered) working jobs like  <br/>\nmy boys have now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question makes me angry.  Those questions too often come from a  <br/>\nfantasy vision of &quot;high school graduates&quot; as all valedictorians and  <br/>\ncaptains of the football team.  That&#39;s BULL.  Schools are by their  <br/>\nvery nature required to turn out MORE average-to-low students than &quot;A  <br/>\nand B&quot; students.   The &quot;honor roll&quot; is worth NOTHING if 90% or more  <br/>\nof the student body is NOT on it.  The more who are off, the better  <br/>\n&quot;honor roll&quot; is.  The more who do NOT get an A, the better the A is.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool produces losers and failures who would never have been  <br/>\nfailures or losers had they not gone to school to be &quot;graded.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool grades first and foremost, and learning is a byproduct of all  <br/>\nthat sorting and rewarding and punishing.  And speaking for at least  <br/>\none gifted student, much of what the &quot;top kids&quot; learn they learned  <br/>\noutside of school and not in.  Yet school, and school defenders, look  <br/>\nat people like me and say &quot;SEE?  School.&quot;  They should look at  <br/>\nprison, and welfare, and gangs, and say &quot;See?  School.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI rarely go on a school rant because I enjoyed school and I don&#39;t  <br/>\nthink schools are evil, just out of hand and far beyond their  <br/>\noriginal intent with no hope of return.   But if someone who&#39;s never  <br/>\nmet a grown unschooler wants to suggest that any average &quot;school kid&quot;  <br/>\nis ahead of or better than my sons, he can face my ire and/or kiss my  <br/>\nbutt.  Or he can keep his kids in school and have that chance (what  <br/>\ndo you think it is, 40%? 60%?)  that they&#39;ll fail and be miserable,  <br/>\nif they don&#39;t kill themselves first.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchoolkids do kill themselves, and sometimes others.<br/>\nSometimes fundamentalist school-at-home mothers have been known to  <br/>\nkill their children.  Three times; maybe that&#39;s all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know of no unschooling-related suicides or murders. Yes, the  <br/>\npopulation is smaller, but it&#39;s also immeasurably happier, unless we  <br/>\nwant to measure in the absolute numbers of suicides and murders  <br/>\ndirectly related.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/teens\">http://sandradodd.com/teens</a><br/>\nThere are some links there.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128461194,"authorName":"Susan McGlohn","from":"Susan McGlohn &lt;wifeto.vegman@...&gt;","profile":"wifetovegman2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] adult unschoolers","postDate":"1143301004","msgId":24901,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYuMS4xLjEuMi4yMDA2MDMyNTEwMzExMi4wMWI4YzkxMEBpbmNvbWluZy52ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTExMC1EQVYxNTI2Mjc5MkI1Q0U5NURBQzFFNUIwOTlEQzBAcGh4LmdibD4=","referencesHeader":"PEJBWTExMC1EQVYxNTI2Mjc5MkI1Q0U5NURBQzFFNUIwOTlEQzBAcGh4LmdibD4="},"prevInTopic":24898,"nextInTopic":24902,"prevInTime":24900,"nextInTime":24902,"topicId":24896,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
