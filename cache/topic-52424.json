I pulled my kids <br/>\nout of  school 5 years ago this May. Initially we used whatever curriculum I <br/>\ncould  get for cheap off ebay or amazon. We had a schedule or routine that <br/>\nwe  followed, and then we had to move. We&#39;ve actually moved 3 times in the <br/>\npast 4  years and fell drastically behind in the book work as a result. I  was <br/>\nfeeling like a terrible mother, and a failure that I wasn&#39;t giving my kids <br/>\na  proper education. Over time I got over that guilt, and wasn&#39;t so  <br/>\nbothered by it, but was happy because my kids were happy -and then I was able to  <br/>\nsee they were learning on their own! It wasn&#39;t until we moved here (upstate <br/>\nNY)  last fall and I met a group of unschoolers that I realized that that&#39;s <br/>\nwhat we  were doing, and really felt validated. Needless to say -I&#39;ll be <br/>\nselling all  of our workbooks and textbooks this summer ;-)<br/>\n <br/>\nMelissa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Why do Unschoolers seem to be &quot;behind&quot;?","postDate":"1270216444","msgId":52448,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFDNkE0QURFLUEzMDQtNDhFMS05MkUzLTg2REU3NEY5OTFCN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDk5M0M5QkM4QTc3NTQ3QTc4RjFFNkMxOUYxOENDOTQzQERlYnJhUEM+","referencesHeader":"PGhwM2RubCsxZm1wQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8RDU5OUQxOTEtNTc3Mi00RkU0LTg2MzctNEY1OTJCNjA1RjUxQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8OTkzQzlCQzhBNzc1NDdBNzhGMUU2QzE5RjE4Q0M5NDNARGVicmFQQz4="},"prevInTopic":52447,"nextInTopic":52451,"prevInTime":52447,"nextInTime":52449,"topicId":52424,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Clarification of a typo: I taught 12-15 year olds for year, years.  six years.  plus two semesters of student teaching, high school level.

Is it important to the happiness and satisfaction of our children to be &quot;ahead?&quot; If I have cooped up my child with a stack of books, and he knows all the history dates since time began, is he &quot;ahead&quot; of the child who has happily played &#39;Indians&#39; in his homemade fort (yet knows little about history dates)?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe times I have felt discouraged about unschooling are the times that I have compared my children to other children.

One (so glad I am confident of unschooling at this point!) is eight, and still does not read, nor does he show much of an interest in reading at this point. Is he behind? Maybe. Does it matter? No. I am confident he will read when he is ready, and he will enjoy it when he does learn to read. And even if he learns to read, but never loves it, that&#39;s O.K., too. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt has taken me a long time to get to this place in our unschooling, but now that I&#39;m here, there&#39;s no turning back.

For some it might.  For others, it might just mean that their emotional intelligence is far ahead of what it would have been had they remained in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also that period, during the tweens, when schooled kids are soaking up facts and figures, while my kids have cocooned themselves away with their interests--becoming knowledgeable about things that aren&#39;t considered important.  Solving puzzles in video games, working out the best way to level up and/or earn gold in WoW, etc.  Most of the world equates learning with fact collecting, so IN COMPARISON, our kids, who are given the time and space to follow their own interests, might be looking &quot;behind&quot; if one doesn&#39;t know where to look.  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust the other day we had a weekend getaway with my in-laws.  My MIL was quite surprised, delighted and honored that her 14 yo grandson was begging to play our family card game, Hand and Foot (like Canasta).  He&#39;s loving the strategy and &quot;the kill&quot; (we always play guys against the girls), plus all the social interaction.  She used to make lots of disparaging comments about teens and about the future time when Joshua would be a teen.  I&#39;ve noticed that those comments have all stopped.  &lt;bwg&gt;  But whether that is &quot;factored in&quot; or not when someone is &quot;evaluating&quot; my kids, I don&#39;t know.
