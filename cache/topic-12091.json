I THINK he would want to do what&#39;s best for Julian,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;including NOT sending him to school, but I am not certain.

When Juls got up he told him <br/>\nwe&#39;re all going to write out some stuff that addresses this. He said that <br/>\nunfortunately they only allow him to have two legal parents but if anything <br/>\nhappened to me or Perry, Beth would adopt him. And that they would do <br/>\nanything they could to make sure he was well cared for and his life would be <br/>\nstable, including continuing learning at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulian was very happy, and it reminded me that we are VERY lucky that Perry <br/>\nis really a very good person.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12085,"nextTopicId":12096}}
