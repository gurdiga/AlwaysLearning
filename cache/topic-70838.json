We put him in preschool and he was kicked out of the first one and I pulled him out of the second one after the teacher made it very clear to me every day that she could not handle him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was then that I looked into homeschooling and discovered unschooling.  We have been unschooling since then, but we had a LOT of deschooling and  paradigm shifting to make over the last 6 years.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think we are doing quite well these days.  Joe&#39;s father had doubts about unschooling for a long time, but now that Joe is reading (easily and fluidly, and it seemed to happen almost overnight) he is pretty solidly on board.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the group of behaviors that bother me is that Joe is constantly attention seeking, rarely stops talking, and always wants someone (myself, my husband, or a friend) to watch him do what he is doing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI read something that flat out says this kind of behavior is caused by parents who over-praise when the child is young and it causes a self esteem issue in the child who now is constantly seeking out this kind of praise.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I can see it. Joe will show me something he did and when I nod or smile or say cool he says &quot;Is it impressive?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn and I did and do praise Joe a lot, possibly for a number of reasons.  1 reason is that we both are genuinely impressed by him - we think he is quite handsome and quite brilliant and both of us are by nature doting with our children.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother reason may have something to do with his personality - thinking back on it I remember that Joe was very attached to us from the day he was born and always seemed to need much more attention than the children around him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember watching young children at the park and and the mall who could be put down and left in one spot and told to stay there ... AND THEY WOULD.  I would be amazed by this behavior.  Joseph NEVER would have sat in one spot and watched me go off a few feet away and do something that didn&#39;t involve him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJoseph talked early, and required almost constant interaction from the day he was born and constant conversation from the day he could talk.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly enough, I have a 4 month old and he also needs pretty constant interaction.  On days like today I wonder are we causing this?  Is it just genetic?  Are we raising children with low self esteem by something we are doing or not doing?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am pretty sensitive by nature, as is Joe.  I also was quite a talker (constantly getting in trouble in school), but I don&#39;t know if I was an attention seeker in the way I am describing Joe to be because my parents were abusive and I don&#39;t remember ever being attached to them really (although I&#39;m sure I was, but certainly not like Joe is to us - me especially).  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is very high-energy and was diagnosed with ADHD and put on ritalin back in 1969.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo this could all easily be genetic and something that I didn&#39;t &quot;cause&quot; per se.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t bother me to listen to him and it doesn&#39;t bother me to give him the attention he needs, but it does bother me to think that I am causing him self esteem issues by giving him this attention or that some sort of damage is already done because of how we have already treated him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you in advance for any thoughts.
