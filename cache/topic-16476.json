Actually, most people walking around are little kids acting as if they are adults.  The only way I&#39;ve found to remain at peace in the midst of such &quot;sleeping&quot; people is to adopt the same attitude with them that I do with my children.  I strive to offer them the full welcome.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe &quot;welcoming response&quot; is the one most people give their children when they are learning to walk and talk: <br/>\n<br/>\n   FULL ENCOURAGEMENT <br/>\n   MUTUAL ENJOYMENT <br/>\n   NO MISTAKES � Falling down is part of the process <br/>\n   NO JUDGMENT � As they learn to walk we don�t say, �You walk funny� or label them as �clumsy.� <br/>\n<br/>\n   INNER MOTIVATION � They want to learn.  They have a strong innate desire to grow in skill.<br/>\n<br/>\n   WE ARE NOT DELIBERATELY TEACHING THEM � They learn from our model.<br/>\n<br/>\n   WE TAKE CUES FROM THE CHILD � We don�t try to force them to walk before they are ready.<br/>\n<br/>\n   NO EXTERNAL REWARDS ARE NECESSARY � Learning and accomplishing are their own reward.<br/>\n<br/>\n   SUPPORT AND COMFORT ARE READILY AVAILABLE<br/>\n<br/>\n   FULL EXPECTATION OF SUCCESS � Barring disability, we have no doubt that they will learn to walk and talk.<br/>\n<br/>\n   BELIEF THAT CHILDREN ARE SELF CORRECTING � If a child says a word incorrectly, we have no doubt that they will eventually learn the correct work.  We even enjoy the mispronouncing and think it is cute.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dd&#39;s creations have lived on: &quot;floaty delvation&quot; (flotation device), &quot;kitty chasm&quot; (catechism).  Don&#39;t you all remember your children&#39;s?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, this welcoming is quite irresistible.  I&#39;m convinced that it&#39;s what everyone is looking for in life.  Almost everyone loses their full welcome before age 5, half at toilet training &quot;time.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut what it is, it&#39;s an open heart that trusts life.  Anyone who unschools already does this, we just need to extend it to all those &quot;grown ups&quot; in disguise.  Since I began doing that, I&#39;ve witnessed really hard core people change before my eyes.  For instance, my mom, the know-it-all kill-joy of the 20th century, starting saying really tender things to me like, &quot;I really like the way you look at me&quot; because I was radiating the tenderness that I always wanted from her.  It&#39;s also what she always wanted.  Neither of us experienced it as long as I was trying to get it from her.  Once I discovered my own capacity to give it under any circumstances, she began to reflect it back to me.  I&#39;m so happy - she&#39;s 83 and I don&#39;t know if she&#39;ll make it another year.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrying to convince anyone of anything is usually futile, because it&#39;s a natural law of physics that any force creates its own counterforce.  But an open, tender invitation is irresistable.<br/>\n<br/>\nFondly,<br/>\n<br/>\nRetta<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nThe New Yahoo!
