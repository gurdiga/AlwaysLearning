Not because the information on Florence Nightengale will add value later on in their lives, but because living a life filled with lovely distractions and engagements is fun and fulfilling and happy making. It adds value now.

It is good to talk to your kids about the things that interest them, that interest you. I talk a lot. Simon and Linnaea have a lot of information and conversations that they have both initiated exploration of or that I or David have talked about. I read Simon Peter Pan when he was 3, I haven&#39;t heard him reference things from that book since shortly after we read it. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat leapt to my mind when I read your post was the idea that it is important to lay down neural pathways when a child is little. That the first 3 years are crucial for the success of a child in later life. There is a book that I have in my amazon.co.uk back up basket (where I keep things that I want to tip the scales when what I needed didn&#39;t get me free shipping) called The Myth of the First Three Years: A New Understanding of Early Brain Development and Lifelong Learning (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jsmf.org/about/j/myth_of_the_first_three_years.htm)\">http://www.jsmf.org/about/j/myth_of_the_first_three_years.htm)</a>. The author lays out some of the studies that have been done on learning and examines whether or not humans are that rigid in how they learn, when they learn. Given the blurbs and reviews that I&#39;ve seen I think he is arguing for a more flexible human brain. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other story that comes to mind is of John Holt learning to play the cello when he was in his 40s. He wrote a book about it called Never to Late: My Musical Life Story (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/558w6k)\">http://tinyurl.com/558w6k)</a>. He uses his own experiences to directly challenge the idea that people are limited by what they learned as children. <br/>\n<br/>\n--------<br/>\nalso does it matter how much or little maths you do.  we do cooking<br/>\nand reading the time and obviously money, but i don&#39;t really play<br/>\nmaths games or puzzles, will this be a disadvantage?<br/>\n---------<br/>\n<br/>\nMath is an integral part of life. It&#39;s a way of solving puzzles and puzzles are everywhere. There are great stories about math in the real lives of kids at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/math/.\">http://sandradodd.com/math/.</a> It&#39;s fun to play math puzzles and games, but I wouldn&#39;t do them with the agenda of getting your kids to learn math, I&#39;d do them because they are fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":228015734,"authorName":"m_aduhene","from":"&quot;m_aduhene&quot; &lt;anthony@...&gt;","profile":"m_aduhene","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"when to start","postDate":"1214103389","msgId":35612,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGcza2YwdCs5N2wyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":35613,"prevInTime":35611,"nextInTime":35613,"topicId":35612,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi all, a friend of mine recently said that u have to tell your children as much as possible while they are young as they will then have a rememberance of it","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1588340932\">Hi all,<br/>\na friend of mine recently said that u have to tell your children as<br/>\nmuch as possible while they are young as they will then have a<br/>\nrememberance of it for later life for eg. if u read to them about<br/>\nflorence nightingale then they &quot;put it to the back of their minds&quot;,<br/>\nbut something mentioned when they are older will bring it back.  <br/>\n<br/>\nalso does it matter how much or little maths you do.  we do cooking<br/>\nand reading the time and obviously money, but i don&#39;t really play<br/>\nmaths games or puzzles, will this be a disadvantage?<br/>\n<br/>\nthanx in advance <br/>\nblessings<br/>\nmichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35592,"nextTopicId":35623}}
