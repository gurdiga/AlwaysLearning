I bet you&#39;d be surprised at what else I was forced to read. Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin was from high school US history. I actually enjoyed Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin. Mary, Queen of Scots was a SNOOZER.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;purpose&quot; was to show how it persuaded the North to take up arms against slavery. Propaganda. My asshole history teacher, Billy Shand (just in case someone&#39;s  still-schooled, church-going child is a student or congregational member of the now Reverend Billy Shand: Get your child AWAY from him NOW!!!), was incorporating *literature* in our history classes. A good idea, in theory---well *in practice* too---IF you like the books. Beats textbooks! So we read a lot of fiction and historical fiction. I don&#39;t think watching movies was an option. &lt;g&gt; Oh---but we did go see Lion in Winter and Romeo and Juliet the previous year (Western Civ).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOh---and the SE US *is* MY real world. &lt;g&gt;  And I have no idea how Uncle Tom is related to The King and I. I can tell you all about Harriet Beecher Stowe and and the impact of the number two best selling book of the 19th century (second only to the Bible).
