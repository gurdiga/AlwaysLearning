All<br/>\nkinds of words, the good ones and the bad ones, have intent and meaning.<br/>\nIt has worked better for me to view them within that context rather<br/>\nthan, good/bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a teen and a 6 yr old.

Name calling, is mean, wether you call<br/>\nsomeone &quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;**ithead&quot;, both of them hurt equally bad.  Our kids<br/>\nunderstand the distinction of stubbing ones toe and hollering out<br/>\nexplatives and name calling, or name calling in fun or to be mean. <br/>\nThere are many subtle nuances to it, that some kids won&#39;t get unless an<br/>\nadult helps them to use the language appropriately.<br/>\n<br/>\nClearly hitting and name calling isn&#39;t nice, address that, not wether or<br/>\nnot the word would turn a PG film into a PG-13 or R.

How far can you go with the <br/>\nname calling before something happens?!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we abandoned the reasonable conversation and just joined in, but <br/>\nwith more made up silly names.  He would call DH or I a &quot;stupid butt <br/>\nhead&quot; and we would respond with something like: &quot;oh yeah, well you <br/>\nare a green brocoli head&quot;  and then he would say something like &quot;NO --<br/>\n you are a rat nose person&quot; -- and then it would get really crazy as <br/>\nwe all tried to come up with wilder combinations.  (Captain <br/>\nUnderpants book about Professor Poopypants is a very funny spin on <br/>\nthe crazy names game.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also informed him of how there is kind of a time and a place for <br/>\neverything.  But in the end, I think that kids often have to learn <br/>\nthe hard way that calling names doesn&#39;t go over well with friends or <br/>\nsiblings -- ie they called someone a name, the person cried, said <br/>\nthey didn&#39;t want to be their friend anymore; or they were called a <br/>\nname, it made them cry, and then they had a chance to understand it <br/>\nfrom an inside perspective.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve mediated a lot of name calling arguments, it seems like it is a <br/>\npart of every child&#39;s journey.  And I always try to remember that <br/>\neven as an adult there are times that _I_ want to call someone a <br/>\nname, at some point along the way I learned how to hold my tongue and <br/>\nI am sure that my children will too. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe original poster asked about unacceptable behaviour -- was it just <br/>\nname calling or was there a *bad* words element to the question?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the kicking?  Is someone getting hurt or is it just pretending?  <br/>\nI mean, in general, we try to use a *people need to feel safe in our <br/>\nhome* guiding principle -- but if the kids are play fighting, it is <br/>\njust what it is, playing (and someone may get hurt but there was no <br/>\nintention to cause injury).  But if they are using kicking to hurt <br/>\nsomeone they are mad at I just try to help them find a less injurious <br/>\nway to solve the problem.  This is another time when I try to really <br/>\nsink into my memories of being a child -- remembering how it felt to <br/>\nbe so mad or frustrated that I *had* to lash out, that feeling of <br/>\nenergy charging down my arm, knowing that I wasn&#39;t going to solve the <br/>\nproblem but not caring because in the moment I was my emotions.  This <br/>\nallows me to empathize with both parties in a *fight* -- I don&#39;t want <br/>\nanyone to get hurt, and I understand how hard it is in the moment to <br/>\nkeep it together enough to &quot;use your words.&quot;  Being available before <br/>\nthat moment occurs is good, key really -- guess that is all part of <br/>\nbeing present -- when I feel the tension rising I can casually ask if <br/>\nthere is anything I can help with and that alone can go a long way to <br/>\naverting the use of physical force.<br/>\n<br/>\nCathy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":159184374,"authorName":"elwazani","from":"&quot;elwazani&quot; &lt;elwazani@...&gt;","profile":"elwazani","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Driver&#39;s Ed","postDate":"1213886613","msgId":35570,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGczZHJhbCtrNWNtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PENBMkZDMjA0LTIzODYtNEJCQy04MUY5LUZDQUQ0N0FGRDkyOEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":35567,"nextInTopic":35574,"prevInTime":35569,"nextInTime":35571,"topicId":9027,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... homeschooled/ ... were ...

Teen drivers cannot be issued a<br/>\nlicense (including getting a &quot;learners&#39; permit)  without taking both<br/>\nclassroom and behind the wheel training.  The state recognizes particular<br/>\ncommercial curriculum which can be taught by parents or one can buy a text<br/>\nand instructors guide/notebook from the state.    The certificate  to be<br/>\nfiled with your auto insurance company for the discount (substantial even<br/>\nfor girls but for unmarried males under 25 even more) is issued by the state<br/>\nand looks the same for all schools.  (Don&#39;t lose it, if you change insurance<br/>\ncompanies the new one may wish to make another copy!  Maybe not in today&#39;s<br/>\nworld of easy info sharing.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI did a commercial program  (several hundred dollars even in 1994) with one<br/>\nson and the $20 parent taught program with the other.  I had to buy an<br/>\napproved student text but got that used and discounted from another<br/>\nhomeschooler.   Both got the same insurance discount until aging out.<br/>\nNeither had to take the driving portion of the test at the DPS where a<br/>\ntrooper rides with the driver.    The school administrator;  whether the<br/>\nschool be a commercial entity, or taught through a government school, or<br/>\nparent taught ; certifies that the student has &quot;passed&quot;  all areas of the<br/>\ndriving test.   My opinion is that provision is abused far less by parents<br/>\nthan by commercial schools.  I have heard of plenty of parents whose<br/>\ndecision was driven by the desire to &quot;know&quot; that their child was getting<br/>\nlots of behind the wheel experience and was competent before being issued a<br/>\n&quot;full&quot; license.<br/>\n<br/>\nShort version: Texas has a parent taught driver&#39;s ed; I thought other states<br/>\n(Illinois?
