When someone is hurt and upset and lashing out, all I can do in that","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1799042173\">When things get rough here the best time for me to deal with it is when things are good. When someone is hurt and upset and lashing out, all I can do in that moment is make sure that no one is getting hurt, that everyone is safe, and to give the person who feels so bad, so angry the space and comfort and whatever else they need until there is calm again.  Try and come up with things that you can do to meet Liv&#39;s needs when she isn&#39;t angry or upset or bossing around her sister. Spend more time with her, play games, listen to music, dance to The Best of Both Worlds with wigs on, be more playful, more involved, more present. <br/>\n<br/>\nI imagine that the deschooling time is a time of feeling a bit lost and a bit unsure of what is expected. It is probably also a point of intense boredom. Having been defined by someone else&#39;s limits for so long it must be hard to figure out something to do without help or input. There is a difference between recovery from school and getting antsy and bored and you have to be aware enough to catch the transition. Not that you should approach it with a top down &quot;gonna give you something to do if you can&#39;t figure out what to do&quot; sort of approach. Unschooling is time intensive. Parenting is time intensive, really, but school and daycare go a long way toward buffering parents from the time they need to invest in their children. Once you&#39;ve given up those sorts buffers it is you who must give that time. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n==============<br/>\nMy quandary and I remind all that my DD(9) Liv is very much still in <br/>\nheavy deschooling mode and surely testing us in all her new found <br/>\nfreedoms...seems to have taken on more of an aurthitative role when it <br/>\ncomes to younger sister(7)Lex..she bosses her around has little to no <br/>\npatience for her and even gets physical with her..swatting/pushing her <br/>\nin announace...We never hit/spanked our children...

I am ashamed to say that I was unaware of the RU or just <br/>\nplain home schooling option....so I dutifully sent my two wonderfully <br/>\nDD off to preschool and than elementary school and secretly I was <br/>\nbitter, jealous and very sad to be away from them for so much of the <br/>\nday.  About a year ago I became aware of a large home schooling sec <br/>\nin my area....and it was truly a light bulb moment...you mean I can <br/>\nlegally take my children out of school...  OMG really.... where do I <br/>\nsign-up !  I spent the rest of the school year education myself on <br/>\neverything and all homeschooly...methods, my state laws ect.  I am <br/>\nblessed  and not so blessed to live in an area,  with a large <br/>\npopulation of and acceptance of HS.  So when I went public with our <br/>\nannouncement we did not get hit with the text book Knee Jerk <br/>\nreaction......&quot; Your going to do what!&quot;...but instead it was....&quot; <br/>\nwhat curriculum are you going to use&quot;.  Problem, I had no interest in <br/>\ncurriculums...or schooling at home. I have a degree in Early <br/>\nChildhood Education...so I have a fairly good working knowledge of <br/>\nhow children our by nature.... natural and curious learners. So, <br/>\nunschooling, made the most sense for us.   We are still very much in <br/>\nthe Deschooling stage.... especially  DH,  myself and oldest DD<br/>\n(9)...she was been in a schooly situation since the age of 3.  But we <br/>\nare happily tugging along so willing to embrace our new freedom from <br/>\nthe statis quo.<br/>\n<br/>\nElisabeth mother to Liv(9) and Lex(7)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31708,"nextTopicId":31691}}
