I don&#39;t think it is that people are <br/>\ndiscouraging their children from using their intellects to think about <br/>\ntv shows or video games, though. I think it is that intellectual <br/>\npursuits are viewed suspiciously because they are so strongly <br/>\nassociated  with academia. Maybe it would be more clear to say that <br/>\nanything that seems &quot;scholarly&quot; is viewed with suspicion and negativity <br/>\nby some unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeems like a case of throwing out the baby with the bathwater - is that <br/>\nwhat you&#39;re getting at? Yes, we are tossing out the schooling - the <br/>\nassignments, the lesson plans, the grading, the testing, the assessing, <br/>\nthe coercion, and all those other trappings of school. For some people <br/>\nthat means throwing out anything that is associated in their minds with <br/>\nschool and that can include anything that is intentionally designed to <br/>\nsupport learning, especially if it is to support learning something that <br/>\nis conventionally taught in schools. The &quot;Countdown&quot; game is a good <br/>\nexample. It is okay for kids to play Magic, the Gathering, because that <br/>\nwas designed just for fun and it is irrelevant that kids who play it <br/>\nalso become really good at mentally adding and subtracting. But <br/>\nCountdown is touted as helping kids learn math, so that is an <br/>\nunschooling no-no?<br/>\n<br/>\nAt a conference, Scott Noelle told a story of finding a cool old school <br/>\ndesk and having it sitting in his house and then being embarrassed by it <br/>\nwhen unschooling friends saw it there. My kids didn&#39;t even get why he&#39;d <br/>\nbe embarrassed - took me a second to catch on. He thought that those <br/>\nunschoolers would think there was something wrong with having an old <br/>\nschool desk in his house because it was associated with school.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, true or not, there are people who are getting the impression that <br/>\nunschoolers go overboard in rejecting absolutely anything (even <br/>\nfurniture) that has any association with school.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that is what you&#39;re talking about, Danielle, then, yes, I think it is <br/>\ngood to discuss it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember some people at a park day seeming a little horrified because <br/>\nthey&#39;d read that Sandra&#39;s daughter had been doing workbooks. (In the <br/>\nbathtub, as I recall.) WORKBOOKS? Sandra Dodd&#39;s kids were allowed to <br/>\nhave workbooks? What? They just couldn&#39;t imagine it. How could it be <br/>\nunschooling if a kid was doing a workbook? I don&#39;t remember what led to <br/>\nHolly&#39;s workbook in the tub, but Rosie loved to get workbooks that were <br/>\nrelated to whatever she was into at the time. When she was into Disney <br/>\nprincesses, she&#39;d want Disney princess coloring books, paper dolls, <br/>\npaint-with-water books, and, yes, workbooks. They were puzzle books to <br/>\nher. Neither of my other kids liked workbooks, but Rosie always liked <br/>\nthat kind of page-by-page kind of thing. She&#39;s 18 and she still buys <br/>\ncoloring books - the Bellerophon and Dover ones -  and she&#39;ll sit and <br/>\ncolor and watch tv or talk, for hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes people don&#39;t get past those &quot;how to get started&quot; unschooling <br/>\nconversations. They take the sound bites away with them, but not the <br/>\ndeeper and bigger principles. So, that&#39;s part of the problem. Another <br/>\npart is that there are people who hate school so much that they really <br/>\ndo want to avoid having anything in their lives that even remotely <br/>\nreminds them of school. Another thing is that some people really ARE <br/>\nanti-intellectual, not just anti-school. There always has been some <br/>\nsuspicion and distrust of more scholarly people by those who aren&#39;t like <br/>\nthat. And, there are those who take things to an extreme for other reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what we can do about most of that - just keep being clear <br/>\nin our own writing and speaking the best we can. I am more aware of this <br/>\nwhole tendency now and I&#39;m more aware of what I might say that might be <br/>\ntaken away and used as justification for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have the same feeling about the no bedtimes, no chores, no limits -- <br/>\nall that stuff. People also carry that away and repeat sound bites and <br/>\ntake it to extremes that I, at least, never intended. So I&#39;m a lot more <br/>\ncareful and clear about how I talk about that stuff, these days. I can&#39;t <br/>\ndo much about how other people talk or behave, so I&#39;ve focused on myself <br/>\nand doing what I can to dispel such attitudes or  misperceptions.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":229237531,"authorName":"Danielle Conger","from":"Danielle Conger &lt;danielle.conger@...&gt;","profile":"danielleconger","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Anti-intellectualism and unschooling","postDate":"1238088539","msgId":43365,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ5Q0JCQjVCLjEwMTA1MDlAZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDJERTUyQzRCLTdEOUEtNDE1Qi1BNzA5LUQxRThDQjA1MzkwOUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDc3NkFCMzAxLTk4QTItNDJFQS04RkQxLUY4REE4QTA3MDkzQUBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4gPDQ5Qzk5NTlFLjQwMTA3MDNAbWFjLmNvbT4gPDRBN0IzNTFCLUExQjYtNDMyOC04NUFDLTIzNDM0OTI3NkE5RkBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4gPDQ5Q0I3MDc3LjgwMTA1MDRAZ21haWwuY29tPiA8MkRFNTJDNEItN0Q5QS00MTVCLUE3MDktRDFFOENCMDUzOTA5QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43364,"nextInTopic":43367,"prevInTime":43364,"nextInTime":43366,"topicId":43326,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I think conversations on <br/>\nstrewing get at that need, and yes, I&#39;ve seen those conversations get <br/>\nkinda divisive in the terms I&#39;m talking about.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s crucial to deschooling. Even with families whose kids never<br/>\n&gt; went to school, the parents themselves need to deschool, and if the<br/>\n&gt; parents keep schooly/academic things there with the idea that they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; crucial, the parents haven&#39;t deschooled themselves.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed, but I think that work is better done in a behind-the-scenes way <br/>\non the parents&#39; part so as not to pass along any of the baggage--in the <br/>\nsame way I wouldn&#39;t want to pass on my math phobia or fear of spiders, <br/>\nfor instance.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf parents are so ingrained by schools to think that teaching is the <br/>\nonly way to learn and that subjects must be separated out and covered <br/>\nregularly, and they can&#39;t possibly help themselves, then removing all <br/>\novertly educational stuff from the kids&#39; lives is one tool to get <br/>\nparents to see the learning that goes on in absolutely everything the <br/>\nkids do. And sure, it can be an expedient tool, but I personally think <br/>\nthat recommendation should come with some caveats--along the lines, <br/>\nmaybe, Kelly Lovejoy&#39;s three stages article.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Although I&#39;ve always had both kinds of things, I don&#39;t agree with your<br/>\n&gt; closing point there. A TV doesn&#39;t tempt a parent to relax into<br/>\n&gt; schoolish expectations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think tv can tempt a parent into laziness. I think there are parents <br/>\nwho could be offering bigger and broader opportunities for their kids, <br/>\nbut who don&#39;t and then offer up unschooling as an excuse.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Video games don&#39;t remind ANY parent of their<br/>\n&gt; school days, even if the video game is Zoombinis. Once the parents<br/>\n&gt; see the learning from those things, the other things won&#39;t be<br/>\n&gt; dangerous. If the parents don&#39;t come to see it, the other materials<br/>\n&gt; will be a foot in the school.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are computer games like Clue Finders that are overtly educational <br/>\nand could easily provide a parent with a foot in the school door an easy <br/>\nway to feel good about video games. I know lots of parents who will only <br/>\nallow these kinds of learning games and none of the others.

Who believe you need to chain them to their desks in order for them to have a hope of becoming as smart, well versed, knowledgeable, or well educated as they are because that is what was done to them.  Seems like a huge unnecessary risk for many who choose to participate in these debates as they see the results in themselves and feel that proves the method works.  They don&#39;t realize that a large portion of those kids in school who just didn&#39;t cope well or get anywhere in life were as intellegent or more so, but do to not being able to fit in the school mold were deemed failures (usually in early elementary) only because they couldn&#39;t squeeze themselves into<br/>\n the rigid space provided.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;-=-I suppose the opposite side of this coin is the idea that reaching  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<br/>\nlevel cap is preferable to learning algebra.

Rosie is <br/>\ntaking college courses - considering pursuing a degree in ASL, again, <br/>\nacademic but not intellectual. Roxana, on the other hand, wants to learn <br/>\nand analyze and critique ideas - ideas from literature and drama and <br/>\nhistory, mostly. That&#39;s what she loves - it is what makes her eyes light <br/>\nup. It is intellectual activity whether or not it involves academic <br/>\nactivity.

Some people could bring<br/>\nin anime or comics and convey a schooling emphasis through that<br/>\nmaterial because they are worried that the kids won&#39;t or can&#39;t learn<br/>\nwithout direct guidance.

Karl plays tons of schooly games on<br/>\nNickJr.com.  Whose choice would it be to label such things schooly or<br/>\nbar him from it?  He likes NickJr (although he doesn&#39;t play there near<br/>\nas often as he used to).  All that &quot;good jobbing, good clapping, good<br/>\nclicking&quot; (ugh) doesn&#39;t seem to faze him.

She assured the list/forum (I think it was at  <br/>\nunschooling.com&#39;s message board or list) that critical thinking was  <br/>\nsomething they taught in school, and she was surprised to have  <br/>\nunschoolers recommend it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFairly recently someone said (where I was and behind my back somewhere  <br/>\nelse in a discussion) that I probably had a house devoid of books,  <br/>\nwhich inspired me to videotape my office and the library.  That didn&#39;t  <br/>\ninclude the books on TV and movies on the shelf in the den, or the  <br/>\nlong shelf of sewing books in the sewing room, or the four shelves of  <br/>\ncookbooks in the kitchen.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been people over the years who tried to say that IF a  <br/>\nfamily would have a child in a music or theatre class or a martial  <br/>\narts or equestrian class, they were hypocritical if they objected to  <br/>\nreading or math classes.  I&#39;ve suggested to some of them that they  <br/>\nshould read the story &quot;Pigs is Pigs,&quot; but y&#39;know... that&#39;s used in  <br/>\nlanguage arts and logic classes, so what kind of hypocrite am I!?   <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;  Also, the attitude toward the child becomes the main focus of  <br/>\nthat story when unschoolers read it, which can&#39;t be helped.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother possible aspect of the anti-intellectual gem is related to  <br/>\nconferences.  There is an undertone of &quot;I don&#39;t go to hear the  <br/>\nspeakers&quot; related to conferences.  Sometimes people take pride in the  <br/>\nfact (whether it&#39;s a fact or not, it&#39;s been stated) that they go to  <br/>\nconferences just to see the other families, and they don&#39;t go to the  <br/>\npresentations.  They might run funshops but they won&#39;t go to hear  <br/>\nspeakers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat, in part, spawned &#39;non-coms&#39; which were speaker-free.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people seem to take pride in not being on discussion lists or  <br/>\nreading much online.  They come, &quot;Discover&quot; unschooling, go home and  <br/>\ndo it oddly and inefficiently, and then come back and complain that we  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t explain it right.

Part of that has been an effort to bring lots of numbers<br/>\nplay into their lives because language play comes naturally to me, but<br/>\nnumbers, not so much. There&#39;s one game called Countdown--a version of an<br/>\nold game where you roll the dice, do the math, and be the first to flip<br/>\nup wooden numbered paddles. I was talking about it once at a local<br/>\nunschoolers group where I used to live and got told that bringing that<br/>\ngame into the house was like bringing curriculum into the house and that<br/>\nit wasn&#39;t &quot;real&quot; unschooling, which would trust kids to come to numbers<br/>\nnaturally in the world around them and to ask if they wanted something<br/>\nmore than that in the same way they might ask to take guitar or piano,<br/>\nfor instance.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nFor people whose kids were in school, it&#39;s probably good not to do  <br/>\nthings like that in the first few months.   My kids were never in  <br/>\nschool and they had lots of &quot;math games.&quot;  Because I didn&#39;t &quot;require&quot;  <br/>\nor push them as more important than other games they had, they played  <br/>\nthem just as happily as anything else.  I didn&#39;t have them with the  <br/>\nattitude that they would learn math *that* way, just that if they  <br/>\nfound math in fun ways and not classroom ways they might not have the  <br/>\naversion I grew to have.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference between what I was doing and what some other parents  <br/>\nmight have done with the same set of materials was subtle.

Even with families whose kids never  <br/>\nwent to school, the parents themselves need to deschool, and if the  <br/>\nparents keep schooly/academic things there with the idea that they&#39;re  <br/>\ncrucial, the parents haven&#39;t deschooled themselves.  If the parents  <br/>\ncan be confident that learning can and does happen in the absence of  <br/>\nacademic things, then the re-addition of those things (in my case from  <br/>\nleaving them out but not &quot;assigning&quot; or glorifying them, which I  <br/>\ncalled strewing when people asked me how I had gotten my kids  <br/>\ninterested in those things, or in any things)...   the readdition of  <br/>\nacademic resources won&#39;t seem schooly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is schooly and there are academic things, and they&#39;re not the  <br/>\nsame thing, but the difference has to do with attitude, presentation  <br/>\nand expectation.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I think it very much could be a part of the deschooling process on  <br/>\nthe<br/>\npart of the parents, but I think sometimes it&#39;s worse than that--I think<br/>\nsometimes the parents themselves have stopped valuing thinking and<br/>\ninquisitiveness about topics that are perceived as the property of<br/>\nacademics because they&#39;ve been damaged by school and have yet to heal. I<br/>\nthink that damage can shut down the kids&#39; intellectual curiosity in<br/>\npotentially damaging ways as well.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was teaching, my students were 12 to 15 years old.  I love that  <br/>\nage.  Many teachers don&#39;t.  They either want kids new to school, or  <br/>\nhigh school kids they can threaten with the lack of graduation.   I  <br/>\nliked the mid-kids because they appreciated interesting teaching (some  <br/>\nof them), and they were hormonally suited for cognitive blossoms of  <br/>\nvarious sorts.  Their thoughts and perceptions were unfolding in big  <br/>\nways.   Some of them had parents who despised schools and teachers.   <br/>\nSome of those kids were sunk, because if they did poorly in school  <br/>\ntheir parents were angry and if they did well in school (or came to  <br/>\nLIKE school), the parents belittled them for that too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there unschooling parents who hate school and were damaged by it?   <br/>\nThere are many.  Are there people who are unschooling because they  <br/>\nliked school and supported it and then were shocked by horrible damage  <br/>\ninflicted on their children.

A TV doesn&#39;t tempt a parent to relax into  <br/>\nschoolish expectations.   Video games don&#39;t remind ANY parent of their  <br/>\nschool days, even if the video game is Zoombinis.  Once the parents  <br/>\nsee the learning from those things, the other things won&#39;t be  <br/>\ndangerous.  If the parents don&#39;t come to see it, the other materials  <br/>\nwill be a foot in the school.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a periodic chart of the elements.  It lives in the bathroom  <br/>\npart time.  At the moment, there are laminated summaries of  <br/>\nterminology and principles from psychology and anthropology, because  <br/>\nHolly&#39;s thinking about studying dreams and memory, and Marty&#39;s  <br/>\ngirlfriend is an anthropology student at the university, studying  <br/>\ngenetics.

Part of that has been an effort to bring lots of numbers <br/>\nplay into their lives because language play comes naturally to me, but <br/>\nnumbers, not so much. There&#39;s one game called Countdown--a version of an <br/>\nold game where you roll the dice, do the math, and be the first to flip <br/>\nup wooden numbered paddles. I was talking about it once at a local <br/>\nunschoolers group where I used to live and got told that bringing that <br/>\ngame into the house was like bringing curriculum into the house and that <br/>\nit wasn&#39;t &quot;real&quot; unschooling, which would trust kids to come to numbers <br/>\nnaturally in the world around them and to ask if they wanted something <br/>\nmore than that in the same way they might ask to take guitar or piano, <br/>\nfor instance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat, to me, was an example of anti-intellectualism that I was talking <br/>\nabout--an active attempt on the parents&#39; part to keep &quot;schooly&quot; things <br/>\nout of their kids lives. And I&#39;ve seen it other times and in other ways <br/>\nover the years on the lists as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it very much could be a part of the deschooling process on the <br/>\npart of the parents, but I think sometimes it&#39;s worse than that--I think <br/>\nsometimes the parents themselves have stopped valuing thinking and <br/>\ninquisitiveness about topics that are perceived as the property of <br/>\nacademics because they&#39;ve been damaged by school and have yet to heal. I <br/>\nthink that damage can shut down the kids&#39; intellectual curiosity in <br/>\npotentially damaging ways as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know people who won&#39;t even look at games marked &quot;educational&quot; or <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t even consider bringing things that look educational or could be <br/>\nconstrued as curricula material into the house. That&#39;s a shame, imo, and <br/>\nno better than a parent who wouldn&#39;t have a tv or allow video games into <br/>\nthe house.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim brought home a periodic table of the elements magnet that he got <br/>\nfrom a vendor at a conference. He stuck it on our fridge, and the kids <br/>\neventually asked about it. They loved hearing about it, still do. Now, <br/>\nwe have a big poster of it, along with a different kind of one for <br/>\ngeology and minerals. We hang up all those cool posters that National <br/>\nGeographic sends because they&#39;re cool and interesting to ponder once in <br/>\na while.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are the kinds of things that might get sidelong looks from certain <br/>\nunschoolers as not being very unschooly materials to have around. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t value these materials any more than the huge bucket of Polly <br/>\nPockets or Bratz or Scooby Doo movies or Gamecube games, or all the <br/>\nother things that we&#39;ve also invested in over the years.

Talking and thinking<br/>\nabout education and the way people learn and live, is pretty<br/>\nintellectual.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis little bit was from Wikipedia (love Wikipedia!):<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Some intellectuals have been vehemently anti-academic; at times<br/>\nuniversities and their faculties have been synonymous with<br/>\nintellectualism, but in other periods and some places the centre of<br/>\ngravity of intellectual life has been elsewhere.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat would suggest that intellectual pursuits aren&#39;t the exclusive<br/>\nproperty of schools.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What does it mean to be &quot;anti-intellectual&quot;? Is it the same as &quot;anti-<br/>\n&gt; school?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think so.  The way that I see anti-intellectualism is; not being<br/>\nelitist, but also, not allowing for thought expansion.  Thought that<br/>\ndeviates from typical life and understanding, is always frowned upon by<br/>\nthose that fear those thoughts.  People who don&#39;t like thinking outside<br/>\nthe box, who fear change and ideas would be anti-intellectual, and you<br/>\nfind a lot of those folks deeply entrenched in school (and religion).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way that schools have evolved, it seems more synonymous with<br/>\nanti-intellectual, than the other way around!  The fact that individual<br/>\nthought is not highly prized, and that common thought is preferred would<br/>\nsuggest that schools are very anti-intellectual!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":321729783,"authorName":"Angela Shaw","from":"&quot;Angela Shaw&quot; &lt;game-enthusiast@...&gt;","profile":"autonomousangela","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Anti-intellectualism and unschooling","postDate":"1237936782","msgId":43329,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVCRTAzRUQzQTZBQzREQjdBOTZFMDgxNTA4Q0VCMDI0QEVib255Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDc3NkFCMzAxLTk4QTItNDJFQS04RkQxLUY4REE4QTA3MDkzQUBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":43326,"nextInTopic":43333,"prevInTime":43328,"nextInTime":43330,"topicId":43326,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Pro-ignorant?
