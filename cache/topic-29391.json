I thought last week maybe I<br/>\nshould, and I don&#39;t know why I thought it.  But in that blog entry,<br/>\nMelissa guessed that i might have a hundred pages.  I&#39;m guessing over<br/>\n300, but I&#39;m going to count, out of burning curiosity, now. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n548, maybe as many as 556 (there were eight I&#39;d have to open to see  <br/>\nwhether they&#39;re unschooling-related or not, but I&#39;ll look later).<br/>\n<br/>\nI had hoped and thought that maybe when I got to 365 I could make  <br/>\nsome kind of annual rotation or something, but it&#39;s past that now.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome pages are short, and would really only be one page printed out,  <br/>\nbut some of those webpages are six or ten print-out pages long.  It&#39;s  <br/>\nlike an encyclopedia of unschooling.  Cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way I counted was to go to the file manager and print out the  <br/>\nnames of folders and files.  I opened each unschooling folder (such  <br/>\nas reading, math, typical days) and counted how many files were in  <br/>\nthere (sometimes it was only three, sometimes 15, and I wrote those  <br/>\nnumbers next to the folders).<br/>\n<br/>\nI went through the list and crossed out anything that was personal,  <br/>\nbiographical/family, kid-pages, Holly&#39;s haircuts, SCA pages.  I  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t count any of those.  I didn&#39;t count the tumbleweed page or the  <br/>\npages of flowers in my yard.  I didn&#39;t count Dumbledore or David  <br/>\nBowie or the hot tub.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat was left I tallied up, and was surprised when it passed 400, and  <br/>\nalmost embarrassed by my bad estimate when it passed 500.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not going to remember that number, for one thing, but it doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nmatter because I keep adding pages.  Kelly just sent me a typical day  <br/>\nentry today (not one she wrote, but one posted to Unschooling Basics)  <br/>\nand I have folders on my desktop of things I&#39;ve saved to put on  <br/>\npages.  Some will just be added to existing pages, but others will  <br/>\nearn their own pages.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m tired of counting now and am going to go read People magazines  <br/>\nand then fall asleep.  Early in the morning I take Holly to the  <br/>\nairport so she can go to Rhode Island for nearly two weeks, and it&#39;s  <br/>\na scary mom-thing to do that.   She&#39;s going to visit Chris Trainor&#39;s  <br/>\nfamily and she&#39;s really excited about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"a review of my site and my book","postDate":"1182304578","msgId":29391,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRDREMzNTFBLTc4MzctNDA3OS1CNjM1LUU3OUY2QkJGNTE5MUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":29392,"prevInTime":29390,"nextInTime":29392,"topicId":29391,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"http://liltinghouse.clubmom.com/the_lilting_house/2007/06/ lovely_lovely_l.html This is interesting.

It&#39;s long, but here&#39;s a part out of the middle  <br/>\nof it:<br/>\n==============================================================<br/>\nWhenever our low-tide times come around, I laugh at myself for  <br/>\nforgetting how true are the words I wrote above: I find that the  <br/>\nchildren catch more fish, so to speak, when the tide is out.<br/>\n<br/>\nA week or two ago, reveling in the richness of low tide, I got in the  <br/>\nmood to read some Sandra Dodd. Sandra&#39;s website is one of the best  <br/>\neducational resources on the &#39;net. She has been collecting wisdom  <br/>\nfrom experienced unschoolers (including herself) for over ten years,  <br/>\nand her site is a vast (really, I&#39;m not using the word carelessly� <br/>\nthere must be a hundred? pages there, at least) repository of quotes  <br/>\nand anecdotes to inspire and edify anyone who is interested in how  <br/>\npeople learn. Be careful; you&#39;ll lose yourself there for hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you&#39;ll find yourself, too. Sandra always makes me think. She can  <br/>\nbe challenging, in the sense of &#39;one who challenges you to examine  <br/>\nyour assumptions.&#39; I&#39;ve lurked on her email lists on and off over the  <br/>\nyears (and not always lurking; I used to participate in the  <br/>\ndiscussion, two or three younguns ago), and I sometimes found her  <br/>\nalmost painfully blunt. But now, ten years into my own home education  <br/>\njourney, I think I understand why she doesn&#39;t mince words in  <br/>\nconversation with other homeschooling/ unschooling parents. She  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want them to lose precious time to friction and tension. She  <br/>\nwants there to be joy and delightful connectedness between parents  <br/>\nand children, always and as soon as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t necessarily agree with her on every topic, but I appreciate  <br/>\nthe way she gets me questioning, pushing, pondering, learning. I like  <br/>\nher emphasis on saying yes as often as possible. That one simple idea  <br/>\ncan effect HUGE changes in your relationship with your kids.  <br/>\nSometimes I get so busy, so caught up in the logistics of managing  <br/>\nthis busy household, that I drift into scolding mode. Ugh. Sandra&#39;s  <br/>\nwork reminds me not to scold, but rather to listen, and to smile, and  <br/>\ninstead of barking out a kneejerk &quot;No&quot; to the child who proposes  <br/>\nsomething, to ask myself &quot;Why not?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n====================================<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I need to go and count my webpages.  I thought last week maybe I  <br/>\nshould, and I don&#39;t know why I thought it.  But in that blog entry,  <br/>\nMelissa guessed that i might have a hundred pages.  I&#39;m guessing over  <br/>\n300, but I&#39;m going to count, out of burning curiosity, now. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLast week she talked about my connections page, and I linked her two  <br/>\npages from the bottom of that:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/connections\">http://sandradodd.com/connections</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nALSO THERE, I&#39;m not sure if I announced to this list or not, is a  <br/>\nlink I got from Jocelyn Vilter of a page with links to all of the  <br/>\nJames Burke shows (Connections, The Day the Universe Changed) on  <br/>\nYouTube.  VERY very (very) cool!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29480,"nextTopicId":29507}}
