Whether or not a child goes to school, families are the <br/>\ncenter of a child&#39;s learning. While as ministers and religious educators we <br/>\ncan support children, youth, and families in growing in their spiritual <br/>\njourneys, we are a resource rather than the experience itself. The real work <br/>\nhappens at home. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are kids like I was whose spiritual journeys were NOT at home nearly as <br/>\nmuch as they were at church.  Maybe UUs don&#39;t get many kids without their <br/>\nparents, but I knew other kids whose parents were pretty worthless to them <br/>\nreligiously speaking.  So if you count on the family beng the experience for <br/>\nevery kid, some will lose out.  <br/>\n<br/>\n(Probably they will find other families or adults to use for that learning <br/>\npurpose, though.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":779600,"authorName":"KathrynJB@aol.com","from":"KathrynJB@...","profile":"kathrynbeth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"An article I wrote","postDate":"1033138887","msgId":9625,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM3LjJkZWEyOTU3LjJhYzVjY2M3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":9626,"prevInTime":9624,"nextInTime":9626,"topicId":9625,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"As some of you know, I work as a Director of Religious Education at a Unitarian Universalist church in Massachusetts.
