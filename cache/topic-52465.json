They both use the tv or music to help them get stuff done.  My m-i-l even reads while she does her morning walks.  The local newspaper took a photo of her doing it.***<br/>\n<br/>\nMy youngest daughter recently found that she could knit while reading, and that the knitting helped her to concentrate on the reading in the same way that listening to music does. (Knitting a familiar repetitive thing, similarly to listening to familiar music). She was quite thrilled with the discovery that she could plow through psychology textbook chapters more efficiently *and* finish promised gifts at the same time. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really excited that this was something she was able to figure out for herself at the ripe old age of (almost) 18, without any baggage attached to &quot;the right way to study&quot;. She&#39;s taking college classes because she wants to, taking the psychology class because she thought it sounded interesting. It comes with a rather massive, dense book, which I silently feared might intimidate her as she&#39;s still a fairly slow reader. (Her learning to read story Sandra saved for me at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/r/dacunefare\">http://sandradodd.com/r/dacunefare</a> ) As it happens, she&#39;s one of the only students in the class who&#39;s doing all the assigned reading. She&#39;s not intimidated, she makes sure she starts reading early enough to get done before the classroom discussion. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt turns out that one of the wonderful things about first going to school as a college student is that you get to skip all those mystery years, where every day is a new chance to screw up because you don&#39;t quite know what to expect.

I thought of putting it out in public, but I  <br/>\nguess I didn&#39;t want your relatives to find themselves portrayed as  <br/>\nfearful garden-killing people.  You were kind to neighbors and  <br/>\nneighbors were kind to you.  It&#39;s just like fairy tale realities, that  <br/>\npeople are rewarded for being good and kind.  And birds would land on  <br/>\ntheir hands. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people are that negative way about everything--cooking, laundry,  <br/>\nhanging out with kids, driving, shopping, feeding their pets.    <br/>\nNegativity, like weeds, like the junk where an old shed was torn  <br/>\ndown.  Negativity makes for a bad neighborhood, and a sad back yard.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n===================<br/>\n<br/>\n***...you who find gardening tedious and boring, ...***<br/>\n<br/>\nThose words used together that way make no sense to me. &lt;g&gt; But I have  <br/>\na gardening gene.

One house was full of Easter lilies and  <br/>\nthen they&#39;d be gone all in one week and we&#39;d plant dahlias and  <br/>\nsnapdragons.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad would put the straggly plants under the benches instead of  <br/>\nthrowing them out and they would live down there, creeping out into  <br/>\nthe walkways. They made for lovely hiding places under the benches,  <br/>\nflower walls on either side. That was a wild, secret garden there with  <br/>\nall those different discarded plants taking hold and then reaching out  <br/>\nfor the sun.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe rented a house when Dylan was little and got the ok to put in a  <br/>\ngarden. The owners had knocked down and old shed and there was junk  <br/>\nall around. We got some friends to come with a backhoe and dump truck  <br/>\nand they dug all the old junk out and brought in beautiful garden  <br/>\nsoil. It was an area right along the ally behind our house and across  <br/>\nthe ally was a busy mechanics shop. Those guys were always coming over  <br/>\nto offer help or advice or to snag strawberries. One started mowing  <br/>\nthe lawn for me that summer, big huge lawn, and we had the old style  <br/>\npush mower that&#39;s popular again now, but he must have felt sorry for  <br/>\nme because he&#39;d come to work every ten days or so on his riding mower  <br/>\nand mow my big lawn. He always got raspberries and strawberries from  <br/>\nme, pie in the summer and jam at Christmas. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso across the ally was a little shack of a house.

I&#39;d leave the garden gate open  <br/>\nand the back door to the house open and in the hundred or so feet  <br/>\nbetween garden and porch there was a clothes line swing, a sandbox, a  <br/>\nwading pool and a dog. &lt;g&gt; Dylan would bring his Tonka trucks into the  <br/>\ngarden and dig holes and make tunnels. He&#39;d help me dig potatoes and  <br/>\nthen haul them in his Tonka truck to the shady place to dry. He&#39;d haul  <br/>\nrocks away for me in his dump truck. He&#39;d crouch in the beans and look  <br/>\nfor Daddy Long legs, and bring them for me to see. He&#39;d look for ripe  <br/>\nraspberries and take some to the dog. And if he got tired of the  <br/>\ngarden he had all those other things to do outside or could go in the  <br/>\nhouse through that wide open door.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe garden was a destination providing soft dirt to dig, sweet treats,  <br/>\ninteresting spiders or on rainy days, good mud and big worms.

It&#39;s boring all by itself. I just got a wireless<br/>\nheadphone set which hooks up to a lot of different things: the computer, my<br/>\nCD/tape player/radio. Now I go out with them on and get some gardening done<br/>\nwhile listening to an eBook, music, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat goes along with the idea that lots of kids (and many don&#39;t outgrow the<br/>\ntrait) like to do more than one thing at a time. Watching tv all by itself<br/>\nmay not be as interesting as watching tv while playing with Legos, batting a<br/>\nballoon around, jumping on a mini-trampoline, talking to the characters in<br/>\nthe show, playacting with a play sword/shield ...

I got comfortable doing things people disapproved of and punished me<br/>\nfor. (Not the worst thing but probably not always great for survival.) I<br/>\nreally bucked criticism hard (I sometimes still do).

Taking the<br/>\nexample of fishing: maybe the interest isn&#39;t about catching fish but playing<br/>\nwith the line, messing about with the fishing rod mechanics, magically<br/>\n&quot;catching&quot; something, etc. I remember when we were kids (I forget the name<br/>\nof the game... &quot;go fish&quot; maybe) a person would be behind a curtain and the<br/>\nchild would drop a string attached to a stick (fishing pole) behind the<br/>\ncurtain, and get a &quot;prize&quot; like candy or a toy clipped to the line.

It may help to not expect him to want it, particularly since he&#39;s<br/>\nbeing absolutely normal in avoiding it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;him watching as much TV as he wants and never being &#39;required&#39; to do<br/>\nanything like a chore is contibuting to this&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAbsolutely. And its wonderful that he is learning to do exactly what he<br/>\nwants to do. Asserting himself without adopting the worlds expectations and<br/>\nguilt. It is your expectations that is causing your trauma. Be gentle with<br/>\nyourself. You have a lifetime of moments to enjoy with your son, and no one<br/>\nis going to test him on whether he is a champion lego architect and judge<br/>\nyou if you don&#39;t have a list of things he can do.

She will be 7 in October.  She likes to try things out, but only REALLY enjoys a few things.  She will get into activities, and then not be into them for a long time.  But I have observed this for a long time and know to keep things around because she will get back into them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe almost always have the TV on, but are almost always also doing something else while we watch.  Can you set up an area so your son can see the TV and do his legos at the same time?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t like doing very many tedious or hard things, either.  I&#39;m realizing that I really DON&#39;T enjoy gardening.  Too tedious, too hard.  I don&#39;t enjoy it.  Sure, it&#39;s satisfying when I do get a whole big area weeded and it looks better than it did, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not going to procrastinate weeding again next time.  I was just laughing with my daughter about all my unfinished knitting projects after complaining about her wanting to use her knitting yarn for something else.  I put off things I DO enjoy doing, too!<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I think about what I would do if I could go back to childhood, and be so free.  I think sometimes I want my daughter to appreciate her childhood more, or use it better, or do what I would do.  I could limit her TV and force her to do more, create more, read more, whatever -- but that&#39;s just silly.  She will find her own interests and spend the time she wants to on those interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying with friends is fantastic!<br/>\n<br/>\n-emiLy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279647515,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"&quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;d.lewis@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Focus Issue","postDate":"1270419332","msgId":52467,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhGMkJDNkQ0QUFFMjQ2MzJCOTY5NkY4RDA2RTM3OThDQGRlYm9yYWg0M2YxM2ZkPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhwYXZjZyszdGUwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":52466,"nextInTopic":52468,"prevInTime":52466,"nextInTime":52468,"topicId":52465,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***What he is doing TODAY is he says he wants to plant the flowers, but as soon as he sits down to do it he decides he doesn t want to afterall.*** What are","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1182936978\">***What he is doing TODAY is he says he wants to plant the flowers, but as soon as he sits down to do it he decides he doesn&#39;t want to afterall.***<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are you doing when he&#39;s starting to plant?

Is that happening with your son?   Is he getting too much instruction and not enough plain old happy participation from the two of you?<br/>\n<br/>\n***I feel like anytime anything seems to be the least bit tedious or hard he doesn&#39;t want to do it.*** <br/>\n<br/>\nI think seven year olds are especially starting to feel that they are less capable than big people and they don&#39;t like it.   Who wants to feel like they can&#39;t do anything right?  So, having the ability to think of cool things to do does not necessarily mean he feels he can successfully do those cool things.    And if you&#39;re kind of attached to the idea that he has to do things a particular way  you might be contributing to his feelings that he won&#39;t be able to do it right. <br/>\n<br/>\n***Sometimes I feel like he is pushy, bossy, unappreciative, and unable to take on any task at all that isn&#39;t easy and wasn&#39;t his idea.***<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you have a focus issue.&lt;g&gt;   You&#39;re focusing too much on things you think are wrong with him.  I think sometimes Only children get too much critical scrutiny from parents.  <br/>\nNext time you look at him critically stop yourself and think of one or two really cool things about him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSeven is still really little.  He has all the years ahead to fish or plant flowers or build Legos.  If he doesn&#39;t do them now, nothing is lost. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Focus Issue","postDate":"1270416574","msgId":52466,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE4NzEyQ0ZGLTc2OUMtNDNBNy04QzhDLUEwNDFDRTU2RkI2M0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhwYXZjZyszdGUwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhwYXZjZyszdGUwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":52465,"nextInTopic":52467,"prevInTime":52465,"nextInTime":52467,"topicId":52465,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-What he is doing TODAY is he says he wants to plant the flowers, but as soon as he sits down to do it he decides he doesn t want to afterall. -=-So then he","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-614940012\">-=-What he is doing TODAY is he says he wants to plant the flowers,  <br/>\nbut as soon as he sits down to do it he decides he doesn&#39;t want to  <br/>\nafterall.<br/>\n-=-So then he says he wants to go fishing.
