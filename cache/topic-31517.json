DH still asked","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1863536467\">I don&#39;t have much advice as to what to tell your husband, because I&#39;m in the same boat.  My kids are 8 and 10 and have always been unschooled.  DH still asked them several times a week if they did their school work today.  They usually just respond by telling him what they&#39;ve been doing.  He is gradually getting better, but it takes a long time.  When the kids were 4 and 6 he got mad at me because they didn&#39;t know who Christopher Columbus was (even in school I don&#39;t know that they would know at that age)  He still says on a regular basis how much I am doing a disservice for my children and they don&#39;t even know who christopher columbus is(they do know now).  <br/>\nWell every couple days I put a trivia question up on our chalk board.  The kids love guessing the answers or looking online to find the answer and write it on board.  It&#39;s just a game we&#39;ve been doing for the last year or so...useless trivia!  The question this week was How much water flows over niagra falls every second?  The kids got books from the library and looked on the internet which led their interests to other things and they actually learned a whole lot more than how much water.  But, DH&#39;s response that he wrote on the board was &quot;why in the world would anyone ever need to know that?&quot;  I asked him why they need to learn half the stuff that parents feel their kids &quot;need&quot; to learn.  He said &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;  ...my thoughts exactly.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know I&#39;m rambling on but here is a funny story...One day my son decided that he was done with homeschooling because I asked him to clean his rabbits cage (that was the deal we have every time he gets a new animal, and yes he has a lot and I do help a lot, but we had an agreement and I was busy, so it was his turn to clean it)  He decided he&#39;s going to school.  I told him we could pretend like he was in school and I&#39;d give him work to do and if he did it for 2 weeks and still wanted to go, I&#39;d let him.  Well it lasted about 10 minutes and he snuck into his room to work on a physics project instead of doing the work I gave him to do.  I went in and told him(in a very teacher-like way) if he wants to be in school then he needs to sit at the table and do his work.  He said I just can&#39;t do school, I&#39;m not ready to learn anything!  Well, maybe he didn&#39;t realize he was doing physics!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo anyway, my best advice would be to point out to your husband what the kids are doing and what abilities they do have and that might help with his fears.  <br/>\nHarmony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  -------Original Message-------<br/>\n&gt;  From: momto3blessings2001 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:emily@...\">emily@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Dh thinks I&#39;m ruining the kids<br/>\n&gt;  Sent: Nov 16 &#39;07 2:28pm<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  I recently plunged into the world of unschooling.
