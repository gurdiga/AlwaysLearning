Doesn&#39;t matter-- as her<br/>\napproach stinks.  Her 9 year daughter hates to read but she insists on<br/>\nmaking her read a certain amount everyday.  The poor child will<br/>\nprobably hate reading forever.  She used to admire her mother but<br/>\nlately she seems a little surly.  I consider her a fellow artist, and<br/>\nher brother to be a marvel, and the 5 year old daughter is a peach. <br/>\nThe mother doesn&#39;t quite see these things the way I do or the<br/>\npossibility of relating to children differently.  You see there&#39;s a<br/>\nculturally accepted standard for how one talks down to children.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think she relates respectful to herself either.  That&#39;s another<br/>\nthing.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrue, she isn&#39;t using a curriculum but gives assignments and gave even<br/>\nmore assignments when she considered herself an unschooler.  She<br/>\nspanks and yells--- not a believer in gentle parenting, and while that<br/>\nisn&#39;t directly related, it&#39;s a bit antithetical to trusting your kids<br/>\nto learn on their own or enriching their environment.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI listen to her commentary to her kids and watch her behavior with my<br/>\nchin firmly picked up off the floor at all times and my opinion kept<br/>\nto myself for the most part but it&#39;s oppressive if she could but see<br/>\nit.  I, &quot;little miss crunchier than thou&quot; (LUV that) that I am, would<br/>\nnever be able to influence her by telling her what to do or think or<br/>\nfeel.  I may not be able to influence her ANYway, and sometimes I<br/>\ndon&#39;t care.

I have not posted in a while.  Lately I have<br/>\n&gt; been really involved in both local/in person and<br/>\n&gt; online support and activities for parents with special<br/>\n&gt; needs kids, particularly those homeschooling special<br/>\n&gt; needs kids.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve found an interesting and somewhat disturbing<br/>\n&gt; phenomenon to be pretty common among these groups.<br/>\n&gt; There seem to be a good number of rabid self described<br/>\n&gt; &quot;unschoolers&quot; out there who are not only scaring peole<br/>\n&gt; away and turning people off to unschooling, but also<br/>\n&gt; in my opinion giving us unschoolers, and unschooling<br/>\n&gt; in general, a bad name.  It&#39;s possible that we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; talking about the zeal of the &quot;newly converted&quot; with<br/>\n&gt; these people (mostly women) who in their fervor go<br/>\n&gt; somewhat overboard.  But I think there is also an<br/>\n&gt; element of misunderstanding exactly what unschooling<br/>\n&gt; is.  I thought I would run this idea by this group and<br/>\n&gt; see what your thoughts and experiences are.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The overwhelmingly prevalent attitude I&#39;ve run into<br/>\n&gt; among other homeschoolers is to mistakenly believe<br/>\n&gt; that unschoolers &quot;can&#39;t&quot; use books, textbooks,<br/>\n&gt; curriculums, classes, and so forth.  That&#39;s not all<br/>\n&gt; that surprising, that other homeschoolers don&#39;t really<br/>\n&gt; &quot;get&quot; unschooling.  But what has surprised me is how<br/>\n&gt; many people who call themselves unschoolers don&#39;t seem<br/>\n&gt; to really get it either.  It seems that some folks<br/>\n&gt; just trade one type of controls for another, not to<br/>\n&gt; mention the fact that they seem to be rather<br/>\n&gt; sanctimonious and overbearing towards others who don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; unschool.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now, it&#39;s my understanding of unschooling that<br/>\n&gt; anything you (you as the learner) want, need, or<br/>\n&gt; choose freely to use for your own &quot;education,&quot; or just<br/>\n&gt; to experience, is just dandy.  I usually explain<br/>\n&gt; unschooling to others as not a homeschooling style,<br/>\n&gt; but rather a lifestyle and a basic different view of<br/>\n&gt; how learning happens and of relationships within a<br/>\n&gt; family, and having a lot to do with trusting and<br/>\n&gt; respecting children as people.  I realize this may<br/>\n&gt; just be related to certain types of personalities, but<br/>\n&gt; does it seem to you folks that there is a general<br/>\n&gt; misunderstanding of what unschooling is among<br/>\n&gt; unschoolers?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Nanci K.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

I have not posted in a while.  Lately I have<br/>\nbeen really involved in both local/in person and<br/>\nonline support and activities for parents with special<br/>\nneeds kids, particularly those homeschooling special<br/>\nneeds kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve found an interesting and somewhat disturbing<br/>\nphenomenon to be pretty common among these groups.<br/>\nThere seem to be a good number of rabid self described<br/>\n&quot;unschoolers&quot; out there who are not only scaring peole<br/>\naway and turning people off to unschooling, but also<br/>\nin my opinion giving us unschoolers, and unschooling<br/>\nin general, a bad name.  It&#39;s possible that we&#39;re<br/>\ntalking about the zeal of the &quot;newly converted&quot; with<br/>\nthese people (mostly women) who in their fervor go<br/>\nsomewhat overboard.  But I think there is also an<br/>\nelement of misunderstanding exactly what unschooling<br/>\nis.  I thought I would run this idea by this group and<br/>\nsee what your thoughts and experiences are.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe overwhelmingly prevalent attitude I&#39;ve run into<br/>\namong other homeschoolers is to mistakenly believe<br/>\nthat unschoolers &quot;can&#39;t&quot; use books, textbooks,<br/>\ncurriculums, classes, and so forth.  That&#39;s not all<br/>\nthat surprising, that other homeschoolers don&#39;t really<br/>\n&quot;get&quot; unschooling.  But what has surprised me is how<br/>\nmany people who call themselves unschoolers don&#39;t seem<br/>\nto really get it either.  It seems that some folks<br/>\njust trade one type of controls for another, not to<br/>\nmention the fact that they seem to be rather<br/>\nsanctimonious and overbearing towards others who don&#39;t<br/>\nunschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, it&#39;s my understanding of unschooling that<br/>\nanything you (you as the learner) want, need, or<br/>\nchoose freely to use for your own &quot;education,&quot; or just<br/>\nto experience, is just dandy.  I usually explain<br/>\nunschooling to others as not a homeschooling style,<br/>\nbut rather a lifestyle and a basic different view of<br/>\nhow learning happens and of relationships within a<br/>\nfamily, and having a lot to do with trusting and<br/>\nrespecting children as people.  I realize this may<br/>\njust be related to certain types of personalities, but<br/>\ndoes it seem to you folks that there is a general<br/>\nmisunderstanding of what unschooling is among<br/>\nunschoolers?<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

I have not posted in a while.  Lately I have<br/>\nbeen really involved in both local/in person and<br/>\nonline support and activities for parents with special<br/>\nneeds kids, particularly those homeschooling special<br/>\nneeds kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve found an interesting and somewhat disturbing<br/>\nphenomenon to be pretty common among these groups. <br/>\nThere seem to be a good number of rabid self described<br/>\n&quot;unschoolers&quot; out there who are not only scaring peole<br/>\naway and turning people off to unschooling, but also<br/>\nin my opinion giving us unschoolers, and unschooling<br/>\nin general, a bad name.  It&#39;s possible that we&#39;re<br/>\ntalking about the zeal of the &quot;newly converted&quot; with<br/>\nthese people (mostly women) who in their fervor go<br/>\nsomewhat overboard.

I thought I would run this idea by this group and<br/>\nsee what your thoughts and experiences are.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe overwhelmingly prevalent attitude I&#39;ve run into<br/>\namong other homeschoolers is to mistakenly believe<br/>\nthat unschoolers &quot;can&#39;t&quot; use books, textbooks,<br/>\ncurriculums, classes, and so forth.  That&#39;s not all<br/>\nthat surprising, that other homeschoolers don&#39;t really<br/>\n&quot;get&quot; unschooling.  But what has surprised me is how<br/>\nmany people who call themselves unschoolers don&#39;t seem<br/>\nto really get it either.

I usually explain<br/>\nunschooling to others as not a homeschooling style,<br/>\nbut rather a lifestyle and a basic different view of<br/>\nhow learning happens and of relationships within a<br/>\nfamily, and having a lot to do with trusting and<br/>\nrespecting children as people.
