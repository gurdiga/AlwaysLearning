It puts everything all right into perspective when we start talking about REAL people and putting the self-regulation and radical unschooling into the real world. I think people get bees in their bonnets (me included - very unfortunately) without knowing anyone that&#39;s lived a life like this. Society has such a hold on us all and we listen so hard to what &#39;other&#39; people say, believe and teach us that&#39;s it&#39;s really hard to go against the grain sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut...thankfully, some of us are enlightened and find a better, more peaceful way to live and bring up our children. Thankfully some of us fall across an email list like this one and meet others, more experienced, who can guide us in a different way. Thankfully some of us stumble across beautiful parenting books and get a glimpse of the things we could do better for our precious children. Thankfully we can step aside from scoiety and do a little bit better.<br/>\n<br/>\nKim<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Sandra Dodd <br/>\n  To: AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, March 25, 2006 12:28 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] a question about TV<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  On Mar 24, 2006, at 6:39 AM, Joyce Fetteroll wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; in terms of<br/>\n  &gt; helping children I trust the real life experiences of unschoolers far<br/>\n  &gt; more than I trust scientific studies done on (schooled) children<br/>\n<br/>\n  I want to point out that Joyce (and many others here) are not just  <br/>\n  trusting mothers&#39; reports of their real life experiences.  She has  <br/>\n  met dozens of the kids talked about here, hung out with them, seen  <br/>\n  them in their homes, had some in hers (Marty, Holly and I were  <br/>\n  fortunate to get to stay with Joyce for a few days and tourist in a  <br/>\n  place very exotic, for us).<br/>\n<br/>\n  If any of us were just making this stuff up, the discussion would  <br/>\n  have died years and  years ago.  But this list is four and a half  <br/>\n  years old, and has grown steadily.   UnschoolingDiscussion is nearly  <br/>\n  seven years old.  Yesterday was the tenth anniversary of the first  <br/>\n  time I spoke in public.  Had I been full of shit, it wouldn&#39;t be  <br/>\n  worth mentioning; I woud&#39;ve never spoken again.  But usually when I  <br/>\n  go to a conference, at least one of my kids is there.  And when  <br/>\n  people really meet my kids and talk with them, their fears  <br/>\n  dissolve.   No one can meet my kids, or Pam&#39;s or Joyce&#39;s or those of  <br/>\n  many of the longtime unschoolers we&#39;ve met, learned from, helped  <br/>\n  along, and not KNOW that there&#39;s something to all of this.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Here&#39;s something Holly, who is fourteen, posted on MySpace recently:<br/>\n<br/>\n  Things to do when I get my braces off:<br/>\n  1. Have corn on the cob like all the time<br/>\n  2. Go to Shoney&#39;s and get like a ton of gum from their really cool  <br/>\n  25¢ gum machine<br/>\n  3. Eat carrots until my skin turns orange<br/>\n<br/>\n  I put it up, with commentary, here: http://sandradodd.com/eating/balance<br/>\n<br/>\n  Holly has had braces since she was twelve, and they come off soon.   <br/>\n  She&#39;s not pining for Jolly Ranchers or Tootsie Roll.  She misses  <br/>\n  whole carrots and corn on the cob. And she&#39;s had freedom to reject or  <br/>\n  choose foods her whole life.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s not what mainstream &quot;common knowledge&quot; would predict.  Common  <br/>\n  knowledge encourages parents to make such absolute statements as these:<br/>\n<br/>\n  They would spend all day, every day, in front of the the TV, computer  <br/>\n  or playstation if they were allowed to.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If I I left him to his own plans, he would be playing the gameboy or  <br/>\n  watching TV all day long.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Left to himself he would play Gamecube and torment his sister.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My Mitchell (5) would watch it all day if I didn&#39;t say that&#39;s  <br/>\n  enough...get outside and play, now.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I know if I let my son do ONLY what he wanted to do that is what he  <br/>\n  would choose. [of video games]<br/>\n<br/>\n  If I let him do exactly what he wants he will just watch tv constantly.<br/>\n<br/>\n  (More here:  http://sandradoddcom/ifilet )<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Holly, who&#39;s fourteen and longs for carrots, can watch TV or play  <br/>\n  games all day if she wants to.  She can watch R rated movies all she  <br/>\n  wants to.  She can rent them at the video place that&#39;s just a few  <br/>\n  hundred yards out our back gate.  I set their rental privileges to  <br/>\n  &quot;unlimited&quot; years ago.   Yesterday she watched The Lion King while  <br/>\n  she did cut-paper art, and then went and played Guitar Hero until her  <br/>\n  hand hurt, then talked to her brother a while and got in the hot tub  <br/>\n  with her dad.   You might be inclined not to believe me, but those  <br/>\n  who have met Holly or Kirby or Marty are glad to believe it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  YAHOO!

But this list is four and a half  <br/>\nyears old, and has grown steadily.   UnschoolingDiscussion is nearly  <br/>\nseven years old.  Yesterday was the tenth anniversary of the first  <br/>\ntime I spoke in public.  Had I been full of shit, it wouldn&#39;t be  <br/>\nworth mentioning; I woud&#39;ve never spoken again.  But usually when I  <br/>\ngo to a conference, at least one of my kids is there.  And when  <br/>\npeople really meet my kids and talk with them, their fears  <br/>\ndissolve.   No one can meet my kids, or Pam&#39;s or Joyce&#39;s or those of  <br/>\nmany of the longtime unschoolers we&#39;ve met, learned from, helped  <br/>\nalong, and not KNOW that there&#39;s something to all of this.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s something Holly, who is fourteen, posted on MySpace recently:<br/>\n<br/>\nThings to do when I get my braces off:<br/>\n1. Have corn on the cob like all the time<br/>\n2. Go to Shoney&#39;s and get like a ton of gum from their really cool  <br/>\n25¢ gum machine<br/>\n3. Eat carrots until my skin turns orange<br/>\n<br/>\nI put it up, with commentary, here: http://sandradodd.com/eating/balance<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly has had braces since she was twelve, and they come off soon.   <br/>\nShe&#39;s not pining for Jolly Ranchers or Tootsie Roll.  She misses  <br/>\nwhole carrots and corn on the cob. And she&#39;s had freedom to reject or  <br/>\nchoose foods her whole life.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not what mainstream &quot;common knowledge&quot; would predict.  Common  <br/>\nknowledge encourages parents to make such absolute statements as these:<br/>\n<br/>\nThey would spend all day, every day, in front of the the TV, computer  <br/>\nor playstation if they were allowed to.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I I left him to his own plans, he would be playing the gameboy or  <br/>\nwatching TV all day long.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeft to himself he would play Gamecube and torment his sister.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Mitchell (5) would watch it all day if I didn&#39;t say that&#39;s  <br/>\nenough...get outside and play, now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know if I let my son do ONLY what he wanted to do that is what he  <br/>\nwould choose.

She can watch R rated movies all she  <br/>\nwants to.  She can rent them at the video place that&#39;s just a few  <br/>\nhundred yards out our back gate.  I set their rental privileges to  <br/>\n&quot;unlimited&quot; years ago.   Yesterday she watched The Lion King while  <br/>\nshe did cut-paper art, and then went and played Guitar Hero until her  <br/>\nhand hurt, then talked to her brother a while and got in the hot tub  <br/>\nwith her dad.

If you�d  <br/>\nlike to help, I can be done even sooner.�<br/>\n�Yes, you can buy that.

Is your need to put the  <br/>\nclothes away more important than a fun time spent playing with them?  <br/>\nThink about the memories you&#39;re creating for your daughter: a  <br/>\nknowledge that the summer clothes were put away in a timely manner or  <br/>\nan hour spent pretending with them.<br/>\nI�d go get the clothes and apologize for being mean and rude to her.  <br/>\nEven if she�s a grudge holder and doesn�t want to play any more, the  <br/>\nfact that you apologize will make a difference even if she doesn�t  <br/>\nshow it. It will let her know you recognize that her needs are  <br/>\nimportant and that you didn�t treat them that way.<br/>\nWe can view children&#39;s needs as inconvenient for us or we can view  <br/>\nthem as people who need our help doing what they want to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an adult if I want to paint, I get out the paints. If want a Coke  <br/>\nfrom the store, I get in the car and go. If I want to not cook  <br/>\ndinner, I can order pizza.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had to ask permission to use the paints, or ask my husband to  <br/>\ndrive me, or ask for money and convince him why it was a good idea to  <br/>\nspend it how I wanted to then it would change our relationship  <br/>\nknowing that he had the power to grant or deny my request based on  <br/>\n*his* perception of what&#39;s important.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not that he trusts me to make the decisions he would. It&#39;s that  <br/>\nhe trusts that I understand my own needs.<br/>\nWe can be our kids partner in helping them get what they want in life  <br/>\nor we can be the barrier that opens or closes according to our whim.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur kids won&#39;t make the same choices we will.

I think one of the best","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-245171294\">I used to worry about my son watching too much TV when we first<br/>\nstarted unschooling after him being in kindergarten for half a year. I<br/>\nthink one of the best things we did concerning TV viewing was to give<br/>\nhim his own VCR with pleanty of blank tapes (and help him use them of<br/>\ncourse.) He&#39;s now just turned 8 and has free use of TV, computer with<br/>\ninternet (we use favorites to help him get back to the places he<br/>\nlikes, help him make a list of his passwords), PS2 (use memory cards),<br/>\nall the books in the house (we real bookmarks for these) , etc. and<br/>\nhas had for a few years now and I feel he uses them all to his advantage. <br/>\n    Why I mention the bookmarks and VHS tapes is becuase it gives him<br/>\neven MORE control over these things in that he can start and stop them<br/>\nwhen he needs to, or get back to a website, or the same spot in a<br/>\ngame, etc. So if something else comes up that he feels is of interest<br/>\nto him then he doesn&#39;t feel like he will miss out on something else.<br/>\nSo even if there is a really interesting episode of Teen Titans on TV<br/>\nhe can still go to the park and not worry about missing anything<br/>\nbecause he can watch the tape when he gets back home, if that&#39;s his<br/>\nchoice. It EMPOWERS him. Yes there are times when you have to make a<br/>\nchoice about things, but life is already so full of choices it helps<br/>\nto have some control. <br/>\n    Before he had this empowerment perhaps he would watch 6 hours of<br/>\nTV just so he wouldn&#39;t miss his favorite hour show, now if he records<br/>\nit he can skip through the stuff he&#39;s not interested in, or he could<br/>\nnot watch it for weeks while he explores a new book or video game. He<br/>\nspends time doing what he is interested in, not what&#39;s dictated by the<br/>\nTV lineup, not watching TV just becuase he feels it may soon be yanked<br/>\naway and he should watch as much of it as he can while he has it. <br/>\n    This type of thinking also can crossover into othre areas of life.<br/>\nI also help empower my son to not overeat. I know this may sould a<br/>\nlittle weird but when he was age 4/5 and we went to Fazoli&#39;s he would<br/>\nliterally eat breadsticks until he would vomit because he liked them<br/>\nSO much and it was so rare he got them! So now we figure out together<br/>\nan amount that we can both agree on (say 2 1/2 breadsticks) with the<br/>\nmeal and then save another amount that we agree on (Say 2 more) away<br/>\nfor a later time like the next day. Perhaps we could make plans to eat<br/>\nthere more often or learn how to make breadsticks at home.

On the one hand I totally agree  <br/>\n  with self-regulation in all areas of life but then, at the back of my  <br/>\n  mind is this concern for my child&#39;s health-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  In general, our culture likes to make children small.  And in  <br/>\n  general, our culture likes to encourage adults to keep children  <br/>\n  down.  So I question anything that says &quot;children shouldn&#39;t do this&quot;  <br/>\n  or that.  When I was little we were told drinking coffee would stunt  <br/>\n  our growth.  I think it was really that coffee was expensive and  <br/>\n  adults didn&#39;t want to share it, and didn&#39;t want to stimulate their  <br/>\n  kids.  That still goes on, with people wanting to limit foods so kids  <br/>\n  don&#39;t &quot;get hyper.&quot;  That&#39;s a way of controlling them biochemically,  <br/>\n  isn&#39;t it?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Oh!  Keith said he read that the U.S. Army (I think he said) won&#39;t  <br/>\n  take someone who has taken psychoactive drugs within the past year  <br/>\n  (when they go to enlist) and that includes Ritalin.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I let my kids know what effect different foods might have, as far as  <br/>\n  I know.  I try to be very careful not to make absolute statements or  <br/>\n  to say anything that will turn out not to be true.  Holly drinks Red  <br/>\n  Bull sometimes.  Sometimes if one is sick I&#39;ll remind them that juice  <br/>\n  and broth/soup are thought to be better than milk products for people  <br/>\n  who are having sinus and mucus situation.  If they&#39;re &quot;irregular&quot; one  <br/>\n  way or the other I&#39;ll point out foods we have that might help or  <br/>\n  hurt.  I don&#39;t tell them what to eat.  I help them make better  <br/>\n  decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Last night Marty was playing a video game he&#39;s only owned since  <br/>\n  Tuesday afternoon.  He&#39;s working full time, and when he came back  <br/>\n  yesterday Kirby was already playing the game and he waited a while.   <br/>\n  It&#39;s called Oblivion.<br/>\n<br/>\n  At about 8:00 he came where I was and said he wanted to keep playing  <br/>\n  his game, but he needed to go to sleep.  I asked whether he couldn&#39;t  <br/>\n  play for another hour and then get by on 8 and a half hours of  <br/>\n  sleep.  He said he *could* but he woudn&#39;t feel as good the next day.<br/>\n<br/>\n  This kid who was allowed to stay up late or go to bed either one, now  <br/>\n  that he goes to work at 6:30, tries to sleep ten hours a night.   <br/>\n  Nobody &quot;makes&quot; him.  He decides each night based on how he feels, how  <br/>\n  hard that day was and how alert he needs to be the next day.   That&#39;s  <br/>\n  not &quot;self regulation,&quot; though.  It&#39;s thoughtful decisionmaking, and  <br/>\n  it&#39;s the way people can be in the absence of being controlled,  <br/>\n  shamed, manipulated or scared.  WEIRD.  I would never have expected  <br/>\n  it as a byproduct of unschooling.  I, who was told when to go to  <br/>\n  sleep and when to wake up, feel that I&#39;ve really won something if I  <br/>\n  stay up really late, and I&#39;m WAY grown up.  I sleep or wake with  <br/>\n  little voices leftover in my head about &quot;should&quot; and &quot;can&quot; and &quot;can&#39;t.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think many &quot;studies&quot; are really justifications for controlling kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  SPONSORED LINKS Unschooling  Attachment parenting  John holt  <br/>\n        Parenting magazine  Single parenting  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  YAHOO!

And in  <br/>\ngeneral, our culture likes to encourage adults to keep children  <br/>\ndown.  So I question anything that says &quot;children shouldn&#39;t do this&quot;  <br/>\nor that.  When I was little we were told drinking coffee would stunt  <br/>\nour growth.  I think it was really that coffee was expensive and  <br/>\nadults didn&#39;t want to share it, and didn&#39;t want to stimulate their  <br/>\nkids.  That still goes on, with people wanting to limit foods so kids  <br/>\ndon&#39;t &quot;get hyper.&quot;  That&#39;s a way of controlling them biochemically,  <br/>\nisn&#39;t it?<br/>\n<br/>\nOh!  Keith said he read that the U.S. Army (I think he said) won&#39;t  <br/>\ntake someone who has taken psychoactive drugs within the past year  <br/>\n(when they go to enlist) and that includes Ritalin.<br/>\n<br/>\nI let my kids know what effect different foods might have, as far as  <br/>\nI know.  I try to be very careful not to make absolute statements or  <br/>\nto say anything that will turn out not to be true.  Holly drinks Red  <br/>\nBull sometimes.  Sometimes if one is sick I&#39;ll remind them that juice  <br/>\nand broth/soup are thought to be better than milk products for people  <br/>\nwho are having sinus and mucus situation.  If they&#39;re &quot;irregular&quot; one  <br/>\nway or the other I&#39;ll point out foods we have that might help or  <br/>\nhurt.  I don&#39;t tell them what to eat.  I help them make better  <br/>\ndecisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night Marty was playing a video game he&#39;s only owned since  <br/>\nTuesday afternoon.  He&#39;s working full time, and when he came back  <br/>\nyesterday Kirby was already playing the game and he waited a while.   <br/>\nIt&#39;s called Oblivion.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt about 8:00 he came where I was and said he wanted to keep playing  <br/>\nhis game, but he needed to go to sleep.  I asked whether he couldn&#39;t  <br/>\nplay for another hour and then get by on 8 and a half hours of  <br/>\nsleep.  He said he *could* but he woudn&#39;t feel as good the next day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis kid who was allowed to stay up late or go to bed either one, now  <br/>\nthat he goes to work at 6:30, tries to sleep ten hours a night.   <br/>\nNobody &quot;makes&quot; him.  He decides each night based on how he feels, how  <br/>\nhard that day was and how alert he needs to be the next day.   That&#39;s  <br/>\nnot &quot;self regulation,&quot; though.  It&#39;s thoughtful decisionmaking, and  <br/>\nit&#39;s the way people can be in the absence of being controlled,  <br/>\nshamed, manipulated or scared.  WEIRD.  I would never have expected  <br/>\nit as a byproduct of unschooling.  I, who was told when to go to  <br/>\nsleep and when to wake up, feel that I&#39;ve really won something if I  <br/>\nstay up really late, and I&#39;m WAY grown up.
