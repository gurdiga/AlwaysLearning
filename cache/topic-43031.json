They do that in at least a<br/>\ncouple of ways: by providing their children with as many options as possible<br/>\nfor making decisions and exploring the world; and by dredging out cultural<br/>\nstrongholds within their own psyche that prevent them from allowing options<br/>\nusually thought to be inappropriate for children.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that: while children are learning about how to use power, many<br/>\nunschooling parents are unlearning a great deal about how to use it. If a<br/>\nbalance isn�t in play, people who understand more about influence and<br/>\npersonal power may take charge of situations better left to others. They<br/>\n(the parents and other adults in a child�s life, in other words) may end up<br/>\ndoing too much while others (children) don�t know how important their input<br/>\nis or feel at a loss about where and when they can act. Conventional<br/>\nparenting often takes advantage of this built-in inequality between adults<br/>\nand children, while unschoolers actively seek not to do so � all while<br/>\nprotecting and advocating for the safety and freedom that may be lacking in<br/>\nthe wider world for their children.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers may fail in their endeavors, but that may not be for lack of<br/>\neffort.

We talked a lot about that last night, how<br/>\nshe was recreating her own family drama of inevitable &quot;bad&quot; outcomes and<br/>\nthat she was totally unaware that she was doing it, and because of that,<br/>\nthere really was very little Chamille could say to her that would help<br/>\nher see it.<br/>\n<br/>\nChamille could see it plain as day, and to her the solution the<br/>\n&quot;problem&quot; was very simple, it wasn&#39;t convoluted with extra drama and<br/>\nside stepping of other issues and navigating this, that, or the other<br/>\nthing, to get from point A to point B.  She finally gave up and threw<br/>\nthe phone and said her friend just wasn&#39;t thinking clearly, which she<br/>\nwasn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen she went online and ended up talking to a newish online friend who<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; the fact that she didn&#39;t go to school because she was<br/>\nhomeschooling.  She said something like, &quot;school doesn&#39;t seem to be<br/>\nserving kids well... in the way they think&quot;.  She kept rephrasing what<br/>\nshe was saying but this person kept asking her if she was a teacher. <br/>\nThey are both about the same age and he lives in CA, so it wasn&#39;t like<br/>\nhe was from another country that didn&#39;t have homeschooling.  She read me<br/>\nwhat was being said, and Chamille was very clear, but the message just<br/>\nwasn&#39;t getting across.  She said that not only does the school not serve<br/>\nhim well, his parents lie to him about everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne could say Chamille influences kids like that, and that makes sense<br/>\nsince kids influence each other a lot, especially when they are in<br/>\nschool.  In many ways, Chamille&#39;s dad and I are still the biggest<br/>\ninfluence in her life, where many of her friends try to avoid parental<br/>\ninfluence.  Perhaps that is the difference?  The influence is accecpted<br/>\nand in fact appreciated and reciprocal.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny C","from":"&quot;Jenny C&quot; &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Interesting Article","postDate":"1236368105","msgId":43041,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdvcnR0OStlNGRmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdvcnQxbSs0amY2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43040,"nextInTopic":43044,"prevInTime":43040,"nextInTime":43042,"topicId":43031,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... unschooling, or an understanding that isn t based on what is going on on this list, at any rate. ...
