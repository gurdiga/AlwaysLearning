What a nice preface to a lot of concern.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithin your very long list of worries the picture you paint is one of you <br/>\nworking very hard to make sure that he has easy access to the foods you are <br/>\nmost uncomfortable with him eating and not quite necessarily such easy <br/>\naccess to other foods. Today Simon went and grabbed candy that was in the <br/>\neasiest place for there to be food. I realized, watching him, that I was <br/>\nhungry but that there wasn&#39;t anything easy to get at except chips and candy, <br/>\nso I got some matzo and buttered and vegemited it and offered some to both <br/>\nSimon and Linnaea. I also offered them some new flavor of cranberry juice <br/>\nDavid had gotten from the store. They both were hungry and wanted to be <br/>\ncatered to. They both took a glass of juice and a matzo. Because I made <br/>\nsomething appealling to them more accesible, or not any effort for them, it <br/>\nwas a nice option.<br/>\n<br/>\nOccassionally I feel like their diet isn&#39;t filled with as much diversity as <br/>\nusual and that is my cue to step up my efforts to make sure there are lots <br/>\nof yummy options easily available. I wasn&#39;t concerned that Simon was having <br/>\ncandy, I was concerned that he was having candy because anything else was <br/>\nmore effort than he wanted to put out (even as little effort as asking <br/>\nme--often just thinking about what you want to eat to ask for it is more <br/>\neffort than he or Linnaea really want to take away from whatever else it is <br/>\nthey are doing).<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could start putting together platters. Offer Wyl and Storm <br/>\nplatters of food filled with cheese cubes and olives on sticks and maybe <br/>\nsome cubed fruit and crisps and chocolates, lots of variety. Bring it to <br/>\nwherever they are, so they don&#39;t have to make the effort. Don&#39;t worry about <br/>\nwhat gets eaten and what doesn&#39;t. See it as a gift that they get to choose <br/>\nwhat they do with it. About the soda consumption, try making your own. Not <br/>\nas an alternative, but as something else to offer. Get some soda water and <br/>\nyummy flavors like coconut or banana or caramel or whatever and let Wyl mix <br/>\nup what he wants and see what he thinks of that. Or brew some root beer and <br/>\nginger ale. We&#39;ve done it a couple of times, it hasn&#39;t come out right yet, <br/>\nbut it is fun trying. (if you google soda flavors there are some cool <br/>\nsites). You could set up your own soda fountain and get those really cool <br/>\nold fashioned soda glasses and make creamed soda and your own cokes and lots <br/>\nof different flavored sodas. Oof, that sounds fun, maybe I need to get some <br/>\nmore flavors. The syrup stuff is also really yummy on shaved ice. Really <br/>\njazz up the whole soda experience!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also not put a time limit on the stuff in the cupboard. It could set <br/>\nup two things, one a sense that he needs to eat everything on his shelf by <br/>\nthe next time you go to the store so that he can get his allotted amount, <br/>\nand two, a sense that you aren&#39;t willing to help him get the things that he <br/>\nwants when he wants them, if at all possible. We only have one car, so today <br/>\nSimon and Linnaea and I are housebound. However, Linnaea wants some more Dr. <br/>\nPepper. So, rather than tell her she has to wait until tomorrow when we&#39;ll <br/>\nhave the car, I e-mailed David and asked him to pick up a bottle. I think, <br/>\nto some extent, by honoring her desire for Dr. Pepper by getting it for her, <br/>\nI&#39;m not making her feel desperate or discounted. It isn&#39;t a rare good, nor <br/>\nis it something that is charged with shame or excitement, or a treat. It <br/>\njust is a food item.

Just thinking it might help you and your dh relax  <br/>\nmore and maybe he&#39;ll develop a taste for yummy and more healthy  <br/>\nstuff. I&#39;m not saying give him dry wheat germ-only cookies - not if  <br/>\nhe&#39;s used to store-bought candy. But, things like homemade rice  <br/>\ncrispy treats, oatmeal chocolate chip cookies or peanut-butter balls  <br/>\nor banana slices dipped in chocolate and frozen. Nuts - every sauteed  <br/>\nraw almonds with a little butter and cinnamon? Heavenly. Or, ice  <br/>\ncream with nut toppings, smoothies, frozen yogurt, frozen grapes,  <br/>\nbaked apple slices with cinnamon, apple or pear slices dipped in  <br/>\nmelted chocolate or caramel. Seems like you can indulge his sweet  <br/>\ntooth and increase the nutrition content. Maybe if you focus on  <br/>\nfinding somewhat more nutritious stuff that he enjoys and then repeat  <br/>\nthose, it&#39;ll take your mind off the other stuff and I bet that&#39;ll  <br/>\ntake the pressure off. Of COURSE, don&#39;t present these as substitutes,  <br/>\npresent them as your own new hobby of cooking/making yummy stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeanut butter balls are especially wonderful - here is a really  <br/>\nsimple and really good recipe. We freeze them, too.<br/>\n1 1/4 cup peanut butter (either smooth or crunchy)<br/>\n1 1/4 cup dry milk<br/>\n3/4 cup honey<br/>\nMix all three ingredients best you can. Then use your hands and mix  <br/>\nall the way. Make little one inch balls. Put the balls on waxed  <br/>\npaper.

I feel that there is an important issue here that<br/>\nhasn&#39;t been brought up yet, and that is of your son&#39;s health. Here in<br/>\nAustralia the childhood obesity rate is soaring, and children as young<br/>\nas 10 years old are developing type 2 diabetes. It all comes down to<br/>\npoor diet and lack of education. Some people here think nothing of<br/>\nsending their kids off to school/pre-school with lunch boxes filled<br/>\nwith sweet sugary foods and even bags of McDonalds!<br/>\nI know this forum is all about freedom of choice in life, but when it<br/>\ncomes to the health of our children I think that some boundaries need<br/>\nto be drawn, at least until the child can make an informed decision on<br/>\ntheir own. We brought our children into the world and it is our<br/>\nresponsibility to look after them, to make sure that they are on the<br/>\nright path to a healthy future.<br/>\nIf I have offended anyone, or inadvertantly critized anyone then I am<br/>\nsorry, I really haven&#39;t meant to. <br/>\nI love the unschooling philosophy.

About the time that I had so much trouble with my <br/>\n&gt; pregnancy  with Storm (Wyl was about 5) and after he was born,<br/>\nattempts at  <br/>\n&gt; regulation/control were gone out the window (5 1/2 years old).<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; When we first started unschooling throughout our lives (instead of<br/>\njust  <br/>\n&gt; academically), I would buy candy, kind of based on a serving size<br/>\n(from the  <br/>\n&gt; package nutrition list) and doubling it, so he had 2 servings of<br/>\ncandy per day  *at <br/>\n&gt; least*-if it went over, that was fine, but it had to be a minimum of<br/>\n2 daily  <br/>\n&gt; servings until we went shopping again. We did this with snack foods<br/>\n(chips,  <br/>\n&gt; pretzels, etc.), candy, cookies and whatever other &quot;not really<br/>\nnutritious&quot; <br/>\n&gt; foods  he picked out at the store. Many of them were organic, and we<br/>\n(parents) <br/>\n&gt; were  cool with whatever he chose. He has a shelf (well, now its<br/>\nmore than just <br/>\n&gt; &quot;a  shelf&quot;) that it was all on, accessible whenever he wanted, no<br/>\nasking  <br/>\n&gt; required-BUT, if he ran out before grocery day, there was no more<br/>\nuntil we went  <br/>\n&gt; shopping. He ate everything in the first hours we got home, at<br/>\nfirst. Then, as  <br/>\n&gt; the weeks passed, it slowed down to where it was lasting until<br/>\nshopping day, <br/>\n&gt; and  sometimes even beyond, so I thought we had found our balance,<br/>\nthere. Then <br/>\n&gt;  pop came into it (soda, soda pop, cola, carbonated drinks,<br/>\nfizzies-whatever <br/>\n&gt; you  call it where you are). It was limited to one a week. Then, I<br/>\nsaw how it <br/>\n&gt; started  figuring largely in his life, and so we expanded that to a<br/>\n4 pack per <br/>\n&gt; shopping  trip. Sometime within this period, we discovered his<br/>\nallergy to <br/>\n&gt; HFCS, and so we  have to make sure to buy things without it-sugar<br/>\nbased soda <br/>\n&gt; seems to be in the  &quot;all natural&quot; realm and is very expensive, and<br/>\nexpense had <br/>\n&gt; figured largely into  things in certain periods of our lives.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; At least a year ago, we removed all non-money restrictions on candy<br/>\n(I&#39;m  <br/>\n&gt; thinking its more like 2 years, but I&#39;m not positive). I&#39;m not sure<br/>\n when the <br/>\n&gt; upswing in candy consumption began, but I&#39;m  thinking 6-9 months.<br/>\nCandy does not <br/>\n&gt; last a week in our house, no matter how  much we buy. There&#39;s been<br/>\nweeks when <br/>\n&gt; we could afford it, that I&#39;ve bought 2  of the biggest packages of<br/>\ncandy he <br/>\n&gt; could find (his choice) at the warehouse  club-we&#39;re talking about<br/>\n$25 just in <br/>\n&gt; candy, so they were very large-I didn&#39;t  even check the servings.<br/>\nSometimes <br/>\n&gt; we&#39;d add a small item or two that he  requested while shopping at<br/>\nanother store <br/>\n&gt; as well. Still, gone within a  week. It concerns me because he truly<br/>\nfills up <br/>\n&gt; on it and isn&#39;t hungry for  nutritious food. Some days I can manage<br/>\nto get <br/>\n&gt; breakfast to him before he&#39;s had  more than 1 or 2 pieces of candy,<br/>\nand then he at <br/>\n&gt; least gets one full meal in,  but he seems to &quot;live for candy&quot;. I&#39;ve<br/>\ntried <br/>\n&gt; big bags of candy, large portions,  individual little packages<br/>\n(snack size, fun <br/>\n&gt; size-like for Halloween). I&#39;ve tried  designating &quot;Wyl&#39;s candy&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;family <br/>\n&gt; candy&quot; (he eats all his and  then starts asking for the small bit<br/>\nthat is <br/>\n&gt; &quot;family candy&quot;). I&#39;ve  tried putting it all out in a large bowl<br/>\nright on their table <br/>\n&gt; so it is always in  arm&#39;s reach, on the shelves they can reach and<br/>\nup high <br/>\n&gt; where I can only  reach-well, until Wyl started climbing-so I could<br/>\nget it for <br/>\n&gt; them and say &quot;yes&quot;  every time they asked. He seems to get some<br/>\nnutrition, <br/>\n&gt; because he has energy and  looks healthy, but I do have a *very*<br/>\nslight concern <br/>\n&gt; that he&#39;s starting to get  winded while playing and he&#39;s starting to<br/>\nlook a wee <br/>\n&gt; bit flabby around the  torso. Nothing I&#39;m highly concerned about, just <br/>\n&gt; *noticing*. Its mostly the  volume of consumption and the possible<br/>\nlack of nutrition <br/>\n&gt; that I&#39;m mildly  concerned about. And slightly annoyed at the<br/>\nconstant layer <br/>\n&gt; of candy wrappers  all over the house, as well as discarded/dropped<br/>\nsticky <br/>\n&gt; candy bits in the couch  and carpet. (Storm tends to put a piece in<br/>\nhis mouth, <br/>\n&gt; bite down, decide he  doesn&#39;t like it and then deposit it in the<br/>\nmost convenient <br/>\n&gt; place-for him.)<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Pop, however, is a biggie for me. He often drinks so much, he hasn&#39;t<br/>\nroom  to <br/>\n&gt; eat anything nutritious. I was really excited last week to find<br/>\nsugar-pop at  <br/>\n&gt; Super Walmart! It was 2 days after we had done our grocery shopping,<br/>\nso I had <br/>\n&gt;  already gotten his 4 pack of bottles and 6 pack of cans (probably<br/>\n$10-13 for <br/>\n&gt;  both), but I was just SO excited finding it somewhere more<br/>\naccessible than <br/>\n&gt; our  organic market AND under $3 for an 8-pack of cans that I bought<br/>\nit, too. <br/>\n&gt; Within  5 days (I don&#39;t pay close attention to how much he drinks by<br/>\nthe day, <br/>\n&gt; because it  would freak me out, so I try to ignore it as much as<br/>\nhumanly <br/>\n&gt; possible), all 18  containers of pop were gone. Add to that the<br/>\nminor annoyance of <br/>\n&gt; pop cans that he  likes to bend and twist apart and leave lying on<br/>\nthe floor <br/>\n&gt; all sharp and pointy,  pop tabs torn off & bottle caps and left<br/>\neverywhere, and <br/>\n&gt; whole  cans and bottles tossed on the floor, behind the couch, on the <br/>\n&gt; furniture, in the  yard-wherever it lands. I&#39;m NOT comfortable with<br/>\nchemical <br/>\n&gt; sugar-substitute  sweeteners, but he&#39;s found a flavored water that<br/>\nhas aspartame in it, <br/>\n&gt; and I will  buy him one a week-no more. He&#39;s not offered to buy any<br/>\npop on <br/>\n&gt; his own with his  allowance, but I certainly couldn&#39;t say no to<br/>\nthat... (He does <br/>\n&gt;  occasionally insist on buying candy with his allowance, even when<br/>\nwe  offer <br/>\n&gt; to buy it for him.) I also have serious concerns about the <br/>\nphosphorous and <br/>\n&gt; its affect on the calcium in bones-especially growing bones, and <br/>\nthat is really <br/>\n&gt; the &quot;big green monster&quot; of my worry about pop. I&#39;ve talked to DH  about <br/>\n&gt; brewing pop at home so we can avoid that all together, and he&#39;s got<br/>\nthe  equipment <br/>\n&gt; and is willing, but his work just doesn&#39;t allow him much time for <br/>\nstuff like <br/>\n&gt; that. I can&#39;t find a brewed soda anywhere to buy.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; This is worrying both DH *AND* I, and sometimes DH will gripe to Wyl<br/>\nabout  <br/>\n&gt; it. Every once in a while (like last week with the 18 pops), I will<br/>\ncasually  <br/>\n&gt; comment on the amount/time period. I know sometimes I&#39;m just not<br/>\naware of my  <br/>\n&gt; consumption of a thing until its brought to my attention, so I&#39;ll<br/>\nmention <br/>\n&gt; it-but  without judgment. Occasionally (every 3 months or so?? not<br/>\nsure), I will <br/>\n&gt; mention  my concern over calcium, and more often, I will put in my 2<br/>\ncents worth <br/>\n&gt; about  chemical sweeteners-though not while he&#39;s enjoying his<br/>\nflavored water, <br/>\n&gt; or near  that time... usually when he&#39;s asking for the second one in<br/>\na week.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; What&#39;s worse is that DH keeps some diet pop in the house for when<br/>\nhe&#39;s home  <br/>\n&gt; (even though I express my concerns to him about chemical sweeteners,<br/>\ntoo-he  <br/>\n&gt; choses to keep drinking it) in 20 oz bottles and Wyl has started<br/>\ndrinking DH&#39;s  <br/>\n&gt; pop. He&#39;ll take one DH hasn&#39;t finished and finish it, and last week, he <br/>\n&gt; opened  all 5 of the bottles DH had here and took even amounts out<br/>\nof them, so they <br/>\n&gt; all  looked equal, but the pop level was below the label. The<br/>\n&quot;sneaking&quot; is <br/>\n&gt; my alarm  bell-we definitely need to adjust something somewhere.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Oddly enough, sometimes, its not the *consumption* that seems to be<br/>\nthe big  <br/>\n&gt; thing. He&#39;ll swish it in his mouth a long time before drinking it.<br/>\nOr he&#39;ll <br/>\n&gt; put  some in his mouth and spit it in cool arcs in the yard or make<br/>\nwet patterns <br/>\n&gt; on  the porch or sidewalk. Sometimes, he&#39;ll shake one up and open it<br/>\njust to <br/>\n&gt; watch  the fizz go all over. Or just pour it out of the can/bottle<br/>\nto make <br/>\n&gt; neat  patterns. He must have used half his pop in this way about 3<br/>\nweeks ago. <br/>\n&gt; Last  week, it was all drunk and drunk one right after the other,<br/>\nfast. Sometimes <br/>\n&gt; it  makes me think of chain-smoking... He chugs one down, leaves the<br/>\ncan on <br/>\n&gt; the  table and goes for another-sometimes 3-5 in a row like this (not <br/>\n&gt; sure-again, I  try not to notice too much).<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I know there&#39;s a line there somewhere between trust and protection<br/>\nand with  <br/>\n&gt; some things I&#39;m good and I know that line, but with internal things<br/>\nlike  <br/>\n&gt; nutrition and healthy bones that you can&#39;t *measure* damage or lack<br/>\nthereof, I  <br/>\n&gt; have a hard time with finding that line. Things that cause bone<br/>\nbreakage,  <br/>\n&gt; sprains, scrapes, bruises, splinters, punctures, cuts, rashes, etc.<br/>\nI&#39;m  very good <br/>\n&gt; at balancing information given and trusting that if something *does*<br/>\n happen, <br/>\n&gt; I can cope, assess, do damage control, and reassure. I have loads of  <br/>\n&gt; information/experience tucked away in my head about that, having had<br/>\na large  share of <br/>\n&gt; injuries as a kid (and since) and dealing with them. I&#39;m sure a good<br/>\n portion <br/>\n&gt; of this whole thing is we parents needing to relax a bit and deal,<br/>\nbut I  <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know *how* to do that.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Peace,<br/>\n&gt; Sang<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wyl 4/99 and Storm 10/04<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Oh, an afterthought-we have parades here where they throw candy to<br/>\nthe kids  <br/>\n&gt; along the parade route and tootsie rolls are very cheap and most<br/>\nparade units  <br/>\n&gt; throw those.

Candy is still an <br/>\noption, but other things will be there just as accessible.  One of my <br/>\nkids will often eat candy first thing in the morning, then an hour or <br/>\ntwo later is ready for food of another sort.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have another kid who loves pop very much.  I buy as much as I can <br/>\nafford.  She is pretty much the only one who drinks it in the house.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t often, my dh sometimes, and the other kid will rarely drink a <br/>\nfull one and generally wants other things instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems in your description that it isn&#39;t necessarily about drinking <br/>\nit, but about exploring it.  There are so many cool things that you can <br/>\ndo with pop, like putting calcium vitamins in a glass of it, or putting <br/>\na newly lost tooth, or money, or whatever and see what happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe history of pop is kinda cool too.  It really was addicting to begin <br/>\nwith, but it&#39;s not now and that&#39;s cool too.  Go check out some local <br/>\npop breweries if you have some around.  We do here in OR, so that would <br/>\nbe feasible if you live in the right place.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDo propulsion expiriments with the carbonation, balloons or rockets or <br/>\nwhatever.  Use the pop containers for cool things.  Make bowling pins <br/>\nout of them or those whirl pool things where you connect two together.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust explore pop together.  Make side by side blind taste tests with <br/>\nvarying brands.  Forget about the HFCS for a while and just play around <br/>\nwith all kinds of pop.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra said something in another post about allergies becoming a new <br/>\nfad epidemic.  I would say that seems to be true based on my own <br/>\nexperiences.  I have always been allergic to dairy, it makes me really <br/>\nsick, always has, there&#39;s a genetic component to that.  When I was a <br/>\nkid, my sister and I were the only people I knew that were allergic to <br/>\ndairy, or anything for that matter, except the occasional kid who was <br/>\nallergic to bees or peanuts.  It seems that nowdays, tons of kids have <br/>\nallergies to all kinds of things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have one child who got the dairy allergy passed down.  It makes her <br/>\nsick, she knows it and avoids it on her own terms.  I don&#39;t tell her <br/>\nthat she can&#39;t eat it, I just inform her what has dairy in it and how <br/>\nmuch.  She makes her own decisions and it&#39;s not all or none, and we <br/>\nhelp her when she decides to eat it and feels yucky.  She&#39;s 6.  She <br/>\nwill more often than not, avoid the offending item altogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the candy, pop and other even, go to odd stores, foreign stores <br/>\nwhere you can&#39;t read the ingredients and buy unusual stuff.  Mix it up, <br/>\nmake it an interesting exploration.  Go to Asian markets, or German <br/>\nstores or whatever you have near you and buy whatever looks <br/>\ninteresting.

I&#39;ve worked hard to quiet the<br/>\nvoice telling *me* I&#39;m creating another dimple on my ass and to focus on the<br/>\nvoice that&#39;s saying &quot;thanks, that&#39;s just what I needed, right here, right<br/>\nnow&quot;  Personally, I really don&#39;t like sundrops over M&Ms, so sometimes the<br/>\n*organic* or *healthier* options just don&#39;t taste good. Organic Coca-Cola<br/>\nthat actually tastes good??? &#39;twould be my dream come true!!! (as a second,<br/>\nbetter option I sometimes treat myself to an imported from Mexico coke, as<br/>\nit&#39;s still made with cane sugar :::vbg:::)<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a fear in him that you&#39;re going to begin restricting his candy?? Is<br/>\nhe feeling your disapproval and thereby binging before it&#39;s taken away?? Can<br/>\nyou bring more chocolate, maybe more chocolate with nuts, so you&#39;re able to<br/>\nsee some nutritive benefits while he enjoys? How about *making* candy<br/>\ntogether? Bringing candy in as a worthy member of the tribe might help him<br/>\nsee the permanence of the availability.<br/>\nCan you shift your perspective to one of 1-year or 5-years and see the<br/>\nspikes and dips in his sweet consumption? there&#39;s a natural ebb and flow...<br/>\nHayden does sugar spikes and also does protein spikes, where he&#39;ll only eat<br/>\nmeat (no veggies, no fruit, no breads) for a week or longer. I&#39;m cooking<br/>\nburger after burger and steak after steak and chicken breast after chicken<br/>\nbreast and then --suddenly-- he wants a spinach salad. I&#39;ve been concerned<br/>\nabout his size, and knowing how incredibly UNHELPFUL it was to have family<br/>\nmake comment on my body as a child (gotta love it when morbidly obese folks<br/>\ncall a gangly 14-year old &quot;Thunder Thighs&quot;) I&#39;ve made sure not to comment to<br/>\nhim. HE has made comment to me about his own comfort with his body<br/>\nstyle/shape and what can be done about it. We&#39;ll talk lightly about food<br/>\nchoices, mostly focusing on &quot;moving more&quot; not on good vs bad foods.<br/>\nSometimes we talk about the &quot;why&quot; of eating and what leads to the obesity we<br/>\nsee so prevalent in my family; after he asks or comments, not in response to<br/>\n*his* eating.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdd to that the minor annoyance of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; pop cans that he likes to bend and twist apart and leave lying on the<br/>\n&gt; floor<br/>\n&gt; all sharp and pointy, pop tabs torn off & bottle caps and left everywhere,<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; whole cans and bottles tossed on the floor, behind the couch, on the<br/>\n&gt; furniture, in the yard-wherever it lands.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Does he know cans=cash? This helped with Hayden (who loves all things<br/>\nmoney!) keeping cans collected in one spot so we can cash them in (a big<br/>\nbonus in our move to OR is the machines where we put the can in and get a<br/>\nnickel each). We also have a little container for our tabs to help the<br/>\nRonald McDonald house. I found putting a small garbage can near the candy<br/>\neating section helps -- maybe not him, but I don&#39;t have so far to go when<br/>\nI&#39;m picking them up!! Our cousin made long chains from starburst and mamba<br/>\nwrappers (I think I saw Abbi doing that at L&L??) which is another great<br/>\nincentive to collect the wrappers and keep them from getting thrown/blown<br/>\naway.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m NOT comfortable with chemical sugar-substitute sweeteners,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I confess this is a *BIG* one with me!! We do read labels, definitely as an<br/>\n&quot;informed consent&quot; not restriction. Hayden knows his dad had a brain tumor.<br/>\nHayden knows dad&#39;s doctors told him *never* to have nutrasweet. Hayden knows<br/>\nit freaks me out. Hayden knows he has choice about what happens to his body.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust last night he bought a big pack of Juicy Fruit (it now has sugar, HFCS<br/>\n*&* aspartame, oh wait, AND most recently added yellow food coloring!!!)...<br/>\nI didn&#39;t have to say anything except YES with a smile! I didn&#39;t have a<br/>\nreaction, he already knows what he needs to know to make his choices. So<br/>\nwe&#39;re pulling out of the parking lot and he says, &quot;I think it&#39;s okay for me<br/>\nto have nutrasweet as I&#39;m just a kid and it&#39;s not as dangerous because I&#39;m<br/>\nstill growing and changing&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;I think it&#39;s maybe more<br/>\ndangerous for you, as your brain is still developing, building bridges<br/>\nbetween connections and maybe the excitement that nutrasweet causes may<br/>\ninterfere with that, so it should be safer for me... oh wait, maybe not! at<br/>\nmy age, the bridges are collapsing and maybe that excitement might cause the<br/>\nbridges to crumble more quickly and easily. I don&#39;t know, really, I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink anyone really does&quot; And that is the truth, we don&#39;t know. For me<br/>\nthat&#39;s the scary part. For Hayden it&#39;s not. He happily chewed his gum, guilt<br/>\nfree. It&#39;d sure be nice if Wrigley&#39;s had remained aspartame free, but it<br/>\ndidn&#39;t. It&#39;s nice my kid can remain food-guilt free.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but he&#39;s found a flavored water that has aspartame in it,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There is flavored water with Splenda. Artificial yeah, but not a<br/>\nneuroexciter :) Still has an aftertaste to my sugared tongue, not nearly as<br/>\nbad as nutrasweet!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Oddly enough, sometimes, its not the *consumption* that seems to be the<br/>\n&gt; big<br/>\n&gt; thing. He&#39;ll swish it in his mouth a long time before drinking it. Or<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; put some in his mouth and spit it in cool arcs in the yard or make wet<br/>\n&gt; patterns<br/>\n&gt; on the porch or sidewalk. Sometimes, he&#39;ll shake one up and open it just<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; watch the fizz go all over. Or just pour it out of the can/bottle to make<br/>\n&gt; neat patterns. He must have used half his pop in this way about 3 weeks<br/>\n&gt; ago.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve purchased flats of storebrand soda specifically for this purpose!! I&#39;ve<br/>\nrun over cans with my car, they&#39;ve slammed cans on the ground (which is<br/>\nreally cool to see!) they&#39;ve shaken and squirted to their hearts delight and<br/>\nat less than 10 cents per can, I have no justifiable complaints! Full cans<br/>\nof soda on dry ice make really, really cool sounds!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure a good portion<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; of this whole thing is we parents needing to relax a bit and deal, but I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know *how* to do that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sure ya do!! Breathe, baby, breathe!! Smile and love and don&#39;t dwell.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, an afterthought-we have parades here where they throw candy to the kids<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; along the parade route and tootsie rolls are very cheap and most parade<br/>\n&gt; units<br/>\n&gt; throw those.

We can&#39;t have candy thrown at our local parades (city<br/>\nordinance!)... they must figger the kids &#39;round here aren&#39;t smart enough to<br/>\ndistinguish between running in the street at a parade for candy vs running<br/>\ninto traffic.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~diana :)<br/>\nxoxoxoxo<br/>\nhannahbearski.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77070457,"authorName":"Sanguinegirl83@aol.com","from":"Sanguinegirl83@...","profile":"sanguinegirl83","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Help in the &quot;nonnutritive&quot; food department...

The controls  <br/>\nthat were on the child when he was  younger created the desire, quite  <br/>\nlikely.  Countless adults, when discussing their eating habits talk  <br/>\nabout desires they had as children that were unfulfilled, and  <br/>\nshamings they received.  My own parents drank and smoked and wouldn&#39;t  <br/>\nlet my cousin have seconds on milk.  When we had grapes my mother  <br/>\ncounted them out.  If there were donuts, and six of us, each person  <br/>\ngot two.  The taking of a third donut was like a huge family  <br/>\nfelony.

Their desires are ranked.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is obviously a priority in her life.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Families in which their children aren&#39;t right up there in the top<br/>\n&gt; three or so will not succeed at unschooling, I don&#39;t think.  If the<br/>\n&gt; fear of sugar has a greater priority than helping children learn,<br/>\n&gt; then that family is a sugar-activist family, more than an unschooling<br/>\n&gt; family.  There are lots of issues and concerns that can come before<br/>\n&gt; children in a family&#39;s life.  If children are too far down the line,<br/>\n&gt; this list won&#39;t be a good place for them to learn about what&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; important to them.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s all important to me.

There will be people who will<br/>\ndisagree with me but what I think you should do is 1st educate yourself<br/>\non the addictive/harmful nature of the ingredients within the candy,<br/>\nsoda etc- what you will find, among other things, is that when one is<br/>\nconsuming these products  the brain & body in turn suffers greatly<br/>\nrendering cognitive problems as well as a host of other terrible<br/>\nsymptoms of the addiction.

About the time that I had so much trouble with<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; pregnancy  with Storm (Wyl was about 5) and after he was born,<br/>\nattempts at<br/>\n&gt; regulation/control were gone out the window (5 1/2 years old).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When we first started unschooling throughout our lives (instead of<br/>\njust<br/>\n&gt; academically), I would buy candy, kind of based on a serving size<br/>\n(from the<br/>\n&gt; package nutrition list) and doubling it, so he had 2 servings of candy<br/>\nper day  *at<br/>\n&gt; least*-if it went over, that was fine, but it had to be a minimum of 2<br/>\ndaily<br/>\n&gt; servings until we went shopping again. We did this with snack foods<br/>\n(chips,<br/>\n&gt; pretzels, etc.), candy, cookies and whatever other &quot;not really<br/>\nnutritious&quot;<br/>\n&gt; foods  he picked out at the store. Many of them were organic, and we<br/>\n(parents)<br/>\n&gt; were  cool with whatever he chose. He has a shelf (well, now its more<br/>\nthan just<br/>\n&gt; &quot;a  shelf&quot;) that it was all on, accessible whenever he wanted, no<br/>\nasking<br/>\n&gt; required-BUT, if he ran out before grocery day, there was no more<br/>\nuntil we went<br/>\n&gt; shopping. He ate everything in the first hours we got home, at first.<br/>\nThen, as<br/>\n&gt; the weeks passed, it slowed down to where it was lasting until<br/>\nshopping day,<br/>\n&gt; and  sometimes even beyond, so I thought we had found our balance,<br/>\nthere. Then<br/>\n&gt;  pop came into it (soda, soda pop, cola, carbonated drinks,<br/>\nfizzies-whatever<br/>\n&gt; you  call it where you are). It was limited to one a week. Then, I saw<br/>\nhow it<br/>\n&gt; started  figuring largely in his life, and so we expanded that to a 4<br/>\npack per<br/>\n&gt; shopping  trip. Sometime within this period, we discovered his allergy<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; HFCS, and so we  have to make sure to buy things without it-sugar<br/>\nbased soda<br/>\n&gt; seems to be in the  &quot;all natural&quot; realm and is very expensive, and<br/>\nexpense had<br/>\n&gt; figured largely into  things in certain periods of our lives.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At least a year ago, we removed all non-money restrictions on candy<br/>\n(I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; thinking its more like 2 years, but I&#39;m not positive). I&#39;m not sure <br/>\nwhen the<br/>\n&gt; upswing in candy consumption began, but I&#39;m  thinking 6-9 months.<br/>\nCandy does not<br/>\n&gt; last a week in our house, no matter how  much we buy. There&#39;s been<br/>\nweeks when<br/>\n&gt; we could afford it, that I&#39;ve bought 2  of the biggest packages of<br/>\ncandy he<br/>\n&gt; could find (his choice) at the warehouse  club-we&#39;re talking about $25<br/>\njust in<br/>\n&gt; candy, so they were very large-I didn&#39;t  even check the servings.<br/>\nSometimes<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;d add a small item or two that he  requested while shopping at<br/>\nanother store<br/>\n&gt; as well. Still, gone within a  week. It concerns me because he truly<br/>\nfills up<br/>\n&gt; on it and isn&#39;t hungry for  nutritious food. Some days I can manage to<br/>\nget<br/>\n&gt; breakfast to him before he&#39;s had  more than 1 or 2 pieces of candy,<br/>\nand then he at<br/>\n&gt; least gets one full meal in,  but he seems to &quot;live for candy&quot;. I&#39;ve<br/>\ntried<br/>\n&gt; big bags of candy, large portions,  individual little packages (snack<br/>\nsize, fun<br/>\n&gt; size-like for Halloween). I&#39;ve tried  designating &quot;Wyl&#39;s candy&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;family<br/>\n&gt; candy&quot; (he eats all his and  then starts asking for the small bit that<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; &quot;family candy&quot;). I&#39;ve  tried putting it all out in a large bowl right<br/>\non their table<br/>\n&gt; so it is always in  arm&#39;s reach, on the shelves they can reach and up<br/>\nhigh<br/>\n&gt; where I can only  reach-well, until Wyl started climbing-so I could<br/>\nget it for<br/>\n&gt; them and say &quot;yes&quot;  every time they asked. He seems to get some<br/>\nnutrition,<br/>\n&gt; because he has energy and  looks healthy, but I do have a *very*<br/>\nslight concern<br/>\n&gt; that he&#39;s starting to get  winded while playing and he&#39;s starting to<br/>\nlook a wee<br/>\n&gt; bit flabby around the  torso. Nothing I&#39;m highly concerned about, just<br/>\n&gt; *noticing*. Its mostly the  volume of consumption and the possible<br/>\nlack of nutrition<br/>\n&gt; that I&#39;m mildly  concerned about. And slightly annoyed at the constant<br/>\nlayer<br/>\n&gt; of candy wrappers  all over the house, as well as discarded/dropped<br/>\nsticky<br/>\n&gt; candy bits in the couch  and carpet. (Storm tends to put a piece in<br/>\nhis mouth,<br/>\n&gt; bite down, decide he  doesn&#39;t like it and then deposit it in the most<br/>\nconvenient<br/>\n&gt; place-for him.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Pop, however, is a biggie for me. He often drinks so much, he hasn&#39;t<br/>\nroom  to<br/>\n&gt; eat anything nutritious. I was really excited last week to find<br/>\nsugar-pop at<br/>\n&gt; Super Walmart! It was 2 days after we had done our grocery shopping,<br/>\nso I had<br/>\n&gt;  already gotten his 4 pack of bottles and 6 pack of cans (probably<br/>\n$10-13 for<br/>\n&gt;  both), but I was just SO excited finding it somewhere more accessible<br/>\nthan<br/>\n&gt; our  organic market AND under $3 for an 8-pack of cans that I bought<br/>\nit, too.<br/>\n&gt; Within  5 days (I don&#39;t pay close attention to how much he drinks by<br/>\nthe day,<br/>\n&gt; because it  would freak me out, so I try to ignore it as much as<br/>\nhumanly<br/>\n&gt; possible), all 18  containers of pop were gone. Add to that the minor<br/>\nannoyance of<br/>\n&gt; pop cans that he  likes to bend and twist apart and leave lying on the<br/>\nfloor<br/>\n&gt; all sharp and pointy,  pop tabs torn off & bottle caps and left<br/>\neverywhere, and<br/>\n&gt; whole  cans and bottles tossed on the floor, behind the couch, on the<br/>\n&gt; furniture, in the  yard-wherever it lands. I&#39;m NOT comfortable with<br/>\nchemical<br/>\n&gt; sugar-substitute  sweeteners, but he&#39;s found a flavored water that has<br/>\naspartame in it,<br/>\n&gt; and I will  buy him one a week-no more. He&#39;s not offered to buy any<br/>\npop on<br/>\n&gt; his own with his  allowance, but I certainly couldn&#39;t say no to<br/>\nthat... (He does<br/>\n&gt;  occasionally insist on buying candy with his allowance, even when we <br/>\noffer<br/>\n&gt; to buy it for him.) I also have serious concerns about the <br/>\nphosphorous and<br/>\n&gt; its affect on the calcium in bones-especially growing bones, and  that<br/>\nis really<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;big green monster&quot; of my worry about pop. I&#39;ve talked to DH <br/>\nabout<br/>\n&gt; brewing pop at home so we can avoid that all together, and he&#39;s got<br/>\nthe  equipment<br/>\n&gt; and is willing, but his work just doesn&#39;t allow him much time for <br/>\nstuff like<br/>\n&gt; that. I can&#39;t find a brewed soda anywhere to buy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is worrying both DH *AND* I, and sometimes DH will gripe to Wyl<br/>\nabout<br/>\n&gt; it. Every once in a while (like last week with the 18 pops), I will<br/>\ncasually<br/>\n&gt; comment on the amount/time period. I know sometimes I&#39;m just not aware<br/>\nof my<br/>\n&gt; consumption of a thing until its brought to my attention, so I&#39;ll<br/>\nmention<br/>\n&gt; it-but  without judgment. Occasionally (every 3 months or so?? not<br/>\nsure), I will<br/>\n&gt; mention  my concern over calcium, and more often, I will put in my 2<br/>\ncents worth<br/>\n&gt; about  chemical sweeteners-though not while he&#39;s enjoying his flavored<br/>\nwater,<br/>\n&gt; or near  that time... usually when he&#39;s asking for the second one in a<br/>\nweek.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What&#39;s worse is that DH keeps some diet pop in the house for when he&#39;s<br/>\nhome<br/>\n&gt; (even though I express my concerns to him about chemical sweeteners,<br/>\ntoo-he<br/>\n&gt; choses to keep drinking it) in 20 oz bottles and Wyl has started<br/>\ndrinking DH&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; pop. He&#39;ll take one DH hasn&#39;t finished and finish it, and last week,<br/>\nhe<br/>\n&gt; opened  all 5 of the bottles DH had here and took even amounts out of<br/>\nthem, so they<br/>\n&gt; all  looked equal, but the pop level was below the label. The<br/>\n&quot;sneaking&quot; is<br/>\n&gt; my alarm  bell-we definitely need to adjust something somewhere.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oddly enough, sometimes, its not the *consumption* that seems to be<br/>\nthe big<br/>\n&gt; thing. He&#39;ll swish it in his mouth a long time before drinking it. Or<br/>\nhe&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; put  some in his mouth and spit it in cool arcs in the yard or make<br/>\nwet patterns<br/>\n&gt; on  the porch or sidewalk. Sometimes, he&#39;ll shake one up and open it<br/>\njust to<br/>\n&gt; watch  the fizz go all over. Or just pour it out of the can/bottle to<br/>\nmake<br/>\n&gt; neat  patterns. He must have used half his pop in this way about 3<br/>\nweeks ago.<br/>\n&gt; Last  week, it was all drunk and drunk one right after the other,<br/>\nfast.

Before we found whole-life unschooling, Wyl was restricted with regard to sugar when he was","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1355860107\">I need some help getting my (and DH&#39;s) concerns under control.<br/>\n <br/>\nBefore we found whole-life unschooling, Wyl was restricted with regard to  <br/>\nsugar when he was young (though he didn&#39;t really seem to care or ask for much),  <br/>\nand very restricted in/to &quot;non-organic&quot; foods up until he was about 4, then <br/>\nit  was &quot;controlled&quot;. About the time that I had so much trouble with my <br/>\npregnancy  with Storm (Wyl was about 5) and after he was born, attempts at  <br/>\nregulation/control were gone out the window (5 1/2 years old).<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen we first started unschooling throughout our lives (instead of just  <br/>\nacademically), I would buy candy, kind of based on a serving size (from the  <br/>\npackage nutrition list) and doubling it, so he had 2 servings of candy per day  *at <br/>\nleast*-if it went over, that was fine, but it had to be a minimum of 2 daily  <br/>\nservings until we went shopping again. We did this with snack foods (chips,  <br/>\npretzels, etc.), candy, cookies and whatever other &quot;not really nutritious&quot; <br/>\nfoods  he picked out at the store. Many of them were organic, and we (parents) <br/>\nwere  cool with whatever he chose. He has a shelf (well, now its more than just <br/>\n&quot;a  shelf&quot;) that it was all on, accessible whenever he wanted, no asking  <br/>\nrequired-BUT, if he ran out before grocery day, there was no more until we went  <br/>\nshopping. He ate everything in the first hours we got home, at first. Then, as  <br/>\nthe weeks passed, it slowed down to where it was lasting until shopping day, <br/>\nand  sometimes even beyond, so I thought we had found our balance, there. Then <br/>\n pop came into it (soda, soda pop, cola, carbonated drinks, fizzies-whatever <br/>\nyou  call it where you are). It was limited to one a week. Then, I saw how it <br/>\nstarted  figuring largely in his life, and so we expanded that to a 4 pack per <br/>\nshopping  trip. Sometime within this period, we discovered his allergy to <br/>\nHFCS, and so we  have to make sure to buy things without it-sugar based soda <br/>\nseems to be in the  &quot;all natural&quot; realm and is very expensive, and expense had <br/>\nfigured largely into  things in certain periods of our lives.<br/>\n <br/>\nAt least a year ago, we removed all non-money restrictions on candy (I&#39;m  <br/>\nthinking its more like 2 years, but I&#39;m not positive). I&#39;m not sure  when the <br/>\nupswing in candy consumption began, but I&#39;m  thinking 6-9 months. Candy does not <br/>\nlast a week in our house, no matter how  much we buy. There&#39;s been weeks when <br/>\nwe could afford it, that I&#39;ve bought 2  of the biggest packages of candy he <br/>\ncould find (his choice) at the warehouse  club-we&#39;re talking about $25 just in <br/>\ncandy, so they were very large-I didn&#39;t  even check the servings. Sometimes <br/>\nwe&#39;d add a small item or two that he  requested while shopping at another store <br/>\nas well. Still, gone within a  week. It concerns me because he truly fills up <br/>\non it and isn&#39;t hungry for  nutritious food. Some days I can manage to get <br/>\nbreakfast to him before he&#39;s had  more than 1 or 2 pieces of candy, and then he at <br/>\nleast gets one full meal in,  but he seems to &quot;live for candy&quot;. I&#39;ve tried <br/>\nbig bags of candy, large portions,  individual little packages (snack size, fun <br/>\nsize-like for Halloween). I&#39;ve tried  designating &quot;Wyl&#39;s candy&quot; and &quot;family <br/>\ncandy&quot; (he eats all his and  then starts asking for the small bit that is <br/>\n&quot;family candy&quot;). I&#39;ve  tried putting it all out in a large bowl right on their table <br/>\nso it is always in  arm&#39;s reach, on the shelves they can reach and up high <br/>\nwhere I can only  reach-well, until Wyl started climbing-so I could get it for <br/>\nthem and say &quot;yes&quot;  every time they asked. He seems to get some nutrition, <br/>\nbecause he has energy and  looks healthy, but I do have a *very* slight concern <br/>\nthat he&#39;s starting to get  winded while playing and he&#39;s starting to look a wee <br/>\nbit flabby around the  torso. Nothing I&#39;m highly concerned about, just <br/>\n*noticing*. Its mostly the  volume of consumption and the possible lack of nutrition <br/>\nthat I&#39;m mildly  concerned about. And slightly annoyed at the constant layer <br/>\nof candy wrappers  all over the house, as well as discarded/dropped sticky <br/>\ncandy bits in the couch  and carpet. (Storm tends to put a piece in his mouth, <br/>\nbite down, decide he  doesn&#39;t like it and then deposit it in the most convenient <br/>\nplace-for him.)<br/>\n <br/>\nPop, however, is a biggie for me. He often drinks so much, he hasn&#39;t room  to <br/>\neat anything nutritious. I was really excited last week to find sugar-pop at  <br/>\nSuper Walmart! It was 2 days after we had done our grocery shopping, so I had <br/>\n already gotten his 4 pack of bottles and 6 pack of cans (probably $10-13 for <br/>\n both), but I was just SO excited finding it somewhere more accessible than <br/>\nour  organic market AND under $3 for an 8-pack of cans that I bought it, too. <br/>\nWithin  5 days (I don&#39;t pay close attention to how much he drinks by the day, <br/>\nbecause it  would freak me out, so I try to ignore it as much as humanly <br/>\npossible), all 18  containers of pop were gone. Add to that the minor annoyance of <br/>\npop cans that he  likes to bend and twist apart and leave lying on the floor <br/>\nall sharp and pointy,  pop tabs torn off & bottle caps and left everywhere, and <br/>\nwhole  cans and bottles tossed on the floor, behind the couch, on the <br/>\nfurniture, in the  yard-wherever it lands. I&#39;m NOT comfortable with chemical <br/>\nsugar-substitute  sweeteners, but he&#39;s found a flavored water that has aspartame in it, <br/>\nand I will  buy him one a week-no more. He&#39;s not offered to buy any pop on <br/>\nhis own with his  allowance, but I certainly couldn&#39;t say no to that... (He does <br/>\n occasionally insist on buying candy with his allowance, even when we  offer <br/>\nto buy it for him.) I also have serious concerns about the  phosphorous and <br/>\nits affect on the calcium in bones-especially growing bones, and  that is really <br/>\nthe &quot;big green monster&quot; of my worry about pop. I&#39;ve talked to DH  about <br/>\nbrewing pop at home so we can avoid that all together, and he&#39;s got the  equipment <br/>\nand is willing, but his work just doesn&#39;t allow him much time for  stuff like <br/>\nthat. I can&#39;t find a brewed soda anywhere to buy.<br/>\n <br/>\nThis is worrying both DH *AND* I, and sometimes DH will gripe to Wyl about  <br/>\nit. Every once in a while (like last week with the 18 pops), I will casually  <br/>\ncomment on the amount/time period. I know sometimes I&#39;m just not aware of my  <br/>\nconsumption of a thing until its brought to my attention, so I&#39;ll mention <br/>\nit-but  without judgment. Occasionally (every 3 months or so?? not sure), I will <br/>\nmention  my concern over calcium, and more often, I will put in my 2 cents worth <br/>\nabout  chemical sweeteners-though not while he&#39;s enjoying his flavored water, <br/>\nor near  that time... usually when he&#39;s asking for the second one in a week.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhat&#39;s worse is that DH keeps some diet pop in the house for when he&#39;s home  <br/>\n(even though I express my concerns to him about chemical sweeteners, too-he  <br/>\nchoses to keep drinking it) in 20 oz bottles and Wyl has started drinking DH&#39;s  <br/>\npop. He&#39;ll take one DH hasn&#39;t finished and finish it, and last week, he <br/>\nopened  all 5 of the bottles DH had here and took even amounts out of them, so they <br/>\nall  looked equal, but the pop level was below the label.
