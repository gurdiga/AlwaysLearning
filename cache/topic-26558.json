It would be interesting to know if you still have<br/>\n&quot;balloons that you haven&#39;t let go of yet&quot;, that&#39;s all. That simple. &gt;&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure whose family(ies) is being referred to here, but I keep a<br/>\nblog to share some of our day -to-day stuff, so it&#39;s pretty easy to<br/>\nsee what&#39;s up around here.<br/>\nI DO tend to focus on the positive in my blog, but then I try to do<br/>\nthat in my life also. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning, Markus and I had a VERY heated argument. The kids were<br/>\nreally annoyed with us and it didn&#39;t feel very good. The argument<br/>\ndwindled into a really useful discussion and some issues hammered out<br/>\nthat needed to be discussed. We had a peaceful day and happy evening<br/>\nwatching movies and eating ice cream together. It wrapped up with all<br/>\nof us in my room, looking up all sorts of cool information on google,<br/>\nsharing videos and having fabulous discussions.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo even on a day when something unpleasant happened, it turned out<br/>\nreally good and there was a lot of learning. That kind of angry<br/>\nargument hasn&#39;t happened in a very long time...that&#39;s good!:)<br/>\n<br/>\nPerfect? Hell no. But working towards better....always.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26501,"nextTopicId":26559}}
