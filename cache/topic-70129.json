The idea is to draw a four square table and label the quadrants 1. urgent and important 2. urgent but not important 3. non-urgent but important and 4. non-urgent and not important. The idea is to assign each of your business tasks to one of these quadrants and allocate your time accordingly ie prioritise no.1, abandon no.4 and make sure you allocate enough time for no.3 over no.2, which is where most people fail. The point to take away from the exercise (in terms of business/time management) is that people have a tendency to spend more time doing things which are urgent but not important rather than things which are important but not urgent.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found this matrix popping into my head on many occasions eg when I find myself frittering away time or when I find myself telling a child to wait until I&#39;ve loaded the dishwasher or I when I find my mind wandering away from watching a child do something they want me to watch or some such thing.

I don&#39;t use punishment or rewards in my relationship to my children. And reading my post again I can see that I was not clear about the fact that I do tell him to stop the name calling, and I tell him that I do not tolerate any kind of bullying, verbal or other. I have told him a hundred times, and he stops everytime, he get&#39;s it every time. He just does it again when he gets annoyed or just bored and want&#39;s to pick a fight with his brother. They play wonderfully for long periods of time, but it&#39;s bad enough that it happens twice a day or once a day or even once in a while, because it hurts his younger brother to have his older brother that he loves so much call him these things. They never hit eachother, for example, simply because they feel that it&#39;s hurtful and that it&#39;s not anything we do in our family. So how come the same knowledge doesn&#39;t apply to the name calling? There where other things that disrupted the harmony at home after Hakims school experience, for example he started to invent competition games, where he would compete against his brother (and win, due to the age difference). I used to offer something more interesting to do and after a while he stopped to suggest competitions. It&#39;s just the name calling that lingers. The only thing working is to provide a fun, interesting setting for the kids to play in, and minimize confrontations between the brothers (no surprises there). But people living together, kids or adults, are bound to disagree on things or just get on each others nerves occasionally. But calling each other hurtful names is just not an okay way of expressing that. I guess there are no quick fixes to this, I will just keep on be there and give my undivided attention and keep on tell him that it&#39;s not okay.

At first, he was really obnoxious toward my daughter - it was how he was used to treating younger kids at school and the younger brother by his bio mom. And he was used to being told &quot;no, no stop, knock it off, stop it or there will be Consequences&quot; etc. It helped to talk with him about his frustration with a younger child and offer him some other ways to handle that. It helped for me to be on the lookout for the younger sibling doing frustrating things (to Ray) and run interference - be the one to distract the little kid and give Ray a break. And it helped to point out that *I* didn&#39;t talk to him the way he was talking to Morgan - it was especially helpful with Ray because he said over and over that he much prefered the way he was treated at our house. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd over time, I was able to say &quot;hey! knock it off!&quot; and he&#39;d stop - but at first, no, that wouldn&#39;t have been the least bit helpful, it was just more of the same. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Some posts make it sound like a child can do whatever makes him happy.Â Â  Other posts speak of not punishing.Â Â Â  Other posts talk about limiting kids from jumping on other peoples furniture.Â Â Â Â Â  I am not able to differentiate between no punishment, no consequenses,no limits and being able to &quot;enforce kindness&quot;.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>************<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce kids are used to the idea that their interests and desires and values are going to be taken seriously by parents, then any consequences are real life consequences. If I say &quot;hey, knock it off&quot; in a firm voice to one of my kids - or my partner for that matter - that person is going to at least pause and say &quot;I&#39;m sorry, what&#39;s the problem?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nTo use another example, lately my daughter has been creating her own &quot;Warrior Cats&quot; characters and making pictures of them. She downloaded some cat outlines and has been coloring the in different ways. On facebook, someone asked if the drawings were hers and she replied &quot;yes, I downloaded the outlines and colored them&quot; - not misrepresenting herself in any deliberate way, but not understanding exactly what was being asked. So I explained that they were asking if the Outlines were hers as well. It wasn&#39;t a big deal, she wasn&#39;t trying to lie or be sneaky, she just hadn&#39;t thought about the difference between &quot;this is my picture&quot; and &quot;I colored this picture&quot;. I didn&#39;t have to go into a big thing about plagarism or internet piracy or intellectual property rights - she understands the basic ideas already from writing and sharing fan fiction and other kinds of art. There was no need to make a stink about &quot;consequences&quot; because she already understand the principles - not in a &quot;you will be punished&quot; way, but in a &quot;this is how to be kind and thoughtful&quot; sort of way. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;limiting kids from jumping on other peoples furniture<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There have been times when we didn&#39;t go certain places or visit certain people because I knew my kids couldn&#39;t deal with the rules of that environment. Or I&#39;d only go into certain places if I was sure I could stick to my kid like glue and help him or her make good choices. When Ray was first out of school this included things like &quot;don&#39;t climb the display&quot;. He could do it if I was right there helping him, not if I was ten feet away yelling NO! Don&#39;t climb the display wasn&#39;t a rule, it was a choice I was helping him make in the moment. But it can&#39;t Be a real choice in the moment if a kid feels like a hundred rules are hemming him in at every turn - it can only be a choice between following a rule or not following it.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Siblings calling each other bad names","postDate":"1357343946","msgId":70152,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVGNDREM0JGLTQ0MTktNEI5NC05MUM1LTIzOTdBRjQyOTgyREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNTczMzc5MTcuNzU5LllhaG9vTWFpbE5lb0B3ZWIxNDI0MDUubWFpbC5iZjEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtjNmxqbittbDNyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8Q0E2NDUxMTEtNjU5NS00MzNDLUE0MEQtOTk4NEE3OTNCMzE0QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8MTM1NzMzNzkxNy43NTkuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE0MjQwNS5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":70151,"nextInTopic":70153,"prevInTime":70151,"nextInTime":70153,"topicId":70129,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-How is this accomplished?

Usually things don&#39;t go that far. Simon and Linnaea, for example, don&#39;t always get on. When they are more sensitive to each other my presence is a balm. I can change the mood of the room so that they aren&#39;t mean to each other. If they are mean I can easily move the meanness from each other and usually dissipate it. If I can&#39;t dissipate it, often it is coming from something internal, like hunger. Which I can totally respond to. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you&#39;ve written, the questions you&#39;ve asked read as someone who sees their child as merely defiant. They are being obstinate simply to be obstinate. Neither Simon nor Linnaea truly wish the other one harm, even if there are moments when they harm each other. Neither Simon nor Linnaea are unwilling to see if I have point, if what I am suggesting has value. They usually are willing to explore my ideas, not because I&#39;m their mother nearly so much as because I&#39;ve not used my position authority for ill. They don&#39;t see me as doing to them so much as helping them. It&#39;s like with food. Because I&#39;ve never made them eat anything that they wouldn&#39;t like and because I have suggested things that they do like they willing to try something new if I offer it as something they might enjoy. They know that I don&#39;t have an agenda beyond their experiencing something pleasurable and tasty. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn order for you to be able to tell you child you won&#39;t accept meanness, that you won&#39;t accept name calling or cruelty they have to recognise that you are on their side. It isn&#39;t quite respect, or it isn&#39;t the kind of respect that I think of equating with obedience. You aren&#39;t asking, you aren&#39;t demanding, you are simply explaining that you aren&#39;t going to let one child hurt another child. You aren&#39;t going to allow that meanness to become apart of the fabric of your days. That isn&#39;t a threat. It isn&#39;t a promise of punishment. It is a statement of your own intent. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to explain. Let me start again. If David, my husband, were being a pain in the ass because work was stressing him out and he was coming home with ideas that other people had put into his head about how he should treat his family, I&#39;d pull him aside and talk to him. I&#39;d tell him he was hurting people in his family. I would tell him that it wasn&#39;t cool what he was doing. Or something. Because of our relationship, because of our years of building trust and family and a community of two he wouldn&#39;t see me as attacking him so much as me working to make his life and the people who make of a large part of his life happier and better. I wouldn&#39;t be drawing a line in the sand and daring him to cross it, I would be reaching out to try and help him feel better and more connected with us. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe, if you don&#39;t have that relationship with your child, or if your child struggles to see beyond the immediate moment and the feeling within that moment, it would be difficult for them not to see it as a line drawn in the sand. If that were the case, maybe other approaches would be better. Or simultaneous approaches would be better. So one child is bullying another child. Be present. Be in the room. Not in an arms crossed waiting for the inevitable trouble to erupt, but in an engaged and playful way. Make it fun to be happy with each other. Make it not fun to be mean or bullying. Be prepared to take the bully or the bullied child away to do something else when that was needed. Make sure that there is food and drink and comfortable places to relax and interesting things to do. Diminish the unpleasantness by making your home a joyful place to be. Go out and run around more so that energy is used up in moving instead of in growing frustrated enough to<br/>\n lash out. Make it easy to be kind and they will be less likely to be mean. You see your family as your team and you work to make the team work well together. Not by bullying or by words, but by actions and gifts and engagements and kindnesses. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Becky Geer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:beckytgtl@...\">beckytgtl@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Friday, January 4, 2013 11:36 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Siblings calling each other bad names<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;And when an unschooled kid goes to school, I think it&#39;s entirely reasonable for the mom to say (preferably in advance, or as soon as a problem might arise), &quot;If school is going to make you mean, you shouldn&#39;t go,&quot; and &quot;I can&#39;t allow you to bring meanness from school into the house.&quot;&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow is this accomplished?  How can you &quot;not allow&quot;?  Will there be consequences if he does?   This is the BIGGEST part of radical unschooling (parenting) I am having trouble with.    Some posts make it sound like a child can do whatever makes him happy.   Other posts speak of not punishing.    Other posts talk about limiting kids from jumping on other peoples furniture.      I am not able to differentiate between no punishment, no consequenses,no limits and being able to &quot;enforce kindness&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;...It doesn&#39;t matter.  Tell him to stop it, and stop it now.  &quot;<br/>\nWhat if he doesn&#39;t want to stop?      What if he stands there and tells you &quot;No&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You might tell your oldest that when he&#39;s grown and has his own place, he can call his brother dumbass THERE (IF the brother is willing to visit him) but he may NOT do it at your house.&quot;<br/>\nAgain, please advise on how &quot;May not&quot; is enforced.       Please provide the links to the articles regarding this.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecky<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":439465581,"authorName":"Robert and Colleen","from":"&quot;Robert and Colleen&quot; &lt;3potatoes@...&gt;","profile":"trespotatoes","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Siblings calling each other bad names","postDate":"1357342868","msgId":70150,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxZGYwMWNkZWFkNCRmODY2OTA5MCRlOTMzYjFiMCRAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNTczMzc5MTcuNzU5LllhaG9vTWFpbE5lb0B3ZWIxNDI0MDUubWFpbC5iZjEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtjNmxqbittbDNyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8Q0E2NDUxMTEtNjU5NS00MzNDLUE0MEQtOTk4NEE3OTNCMzE0QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8MTM1NzMzNzkxNy43NTkuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE0MjQwNS5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":70147,"nextInTopic":70151,"prevInTime":70149,"nextInTime":70151,"topicId":70129,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"****How is this accomplished?

Will there be consequences if he does?   This is the BIGGEST part of radical unschooling (parenting) I am having trouble with.    Some posts make it sound like a child can do whatever makes him happy.   Other posts speak of not punishing.    Other posts talk about limiting kids from jumping on other peoples furniture.      I am not able to differentiate between no punishment, no consequenses,no limits and being able to &quot;enforce kindness&quot;.****<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a person comes from a point of punishment-based/consequence-based thinking, it can be hard to imagine that kids will stop when they are asked to stop – or that they will be kind when you remind them to be kind – or that they will not hit when you say “don’t hit.”  People tend to have a habit of saying things like “don’t hit your sister or I’ll send you to your room” or “if you come in late you’ll be grounded” or “if you don’t lower your voice I’ll take away your computer.”<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what if they left the punishment/consequence threat out?  What if the parent knew their child, planned for success to the extent they could by setting up an environment and circumstances and activities where their child could most likely succeed, and then dealt with things that happened anyway as those things came along?  What if a mom saw her child about to climb onto Grandma’s couch and said simply “feet on the ground!” or “no climbing here” and then offered something else to do or see or play with or talk about?  What if when that child climbed up anyway, Mom was right there, picked the child up, swung him gently through the air, and distracted him with something to see on the other side of the room?  What if Mom knew her child really loved climbing and invited Grandma to meet them at the park instead of in Grandma’s knickknack-filled living room?  What if 1,000 other things happened besides the things that sound like “if you jump on Grandma’s couch today you’re going to bed an hour early tonight!!”  <br/>\n<br/>\nLots of (mainstream parenting) people spend lots of time saying “don’t hit your sister or I will send you to your room” – and then their child hits his sister – and then they send him to his room kicking and screaming – and then the next day what does he do?  He hits his sister again.  Punishment rarely stops the hitting long term.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the punishment/consequence threats really truly aren’t needed.  I can say to my son “please lower your voice” and I don’t need to follow that up with an “or else” – it’s simply an Is.  A request.  Sometimes a requirement (if we’re somewhere where he Needs to be quiet to be respectful of others or rules of a particular setting, etc.).  If it’s a requirement, and he doesn’t lower his voice, I can say “we need to leave” – not to punish him, but to help him be somewhere where he’s not bothering others.  When he was little if he threw a toy at me and that toy wasn’t a ball or something good for throwing :-) I’d simply ask him if he’d like to play catch, or I’d distract him, or I’d make sure there were lots of soft toys around for throwing that didn’t hurt people or break things, etc.  What I didn’t do was holler “do not throw toys or else!!!” and then stick him in Time Out or slap his hand or do all those other things that some people do to try to Make their kids not throw.  That kind of parenting isn’t relationship-building, and it wouldn’t have done much to curb the throwing anyway.  Punishment doesn’t work so well, and yet people seem to like to do it anyway.  An interesting thing to think about – after all, if punishing worked, wouldn’t we have a world full of Previously Punished And Now Perfectly Behaved People??  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end, there are no magic tricks that will make all unschooled kids behave Exactly like their parents want – just like there are no magic tricks that make all not-unschooled kids behave like their parents want.  But with unschooling, there is partnering and supporting and figuring out what works for each individual child and family to keep things as peaceful and well-functioning as possible.  It’s not that non-unschooling families can’t partner and support too – it’s more that in unschooling families, doing so is usually a particular focus – with parents making specific effort made to help their kids, approach them with kindness, and figure out how to help them meet their needs (to express anger, or move their bodies physically, or master a new skill, or enjoy themselves, or get something good to eat, etc., etc.) without anyone else getting hurt (from hitting, or throwing, or loud voices ruining the show they want to see, or muddy feet on their couch, or special food they were saving being eaten etc etc) in the process.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nColleen <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":526327471,"authorName":"Becky Geer","from":"Becky Geer &lt;beckytgtl@...&gt;","profile":"beckytgtl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Siblings calling each other bad names","postDate":"1357337917","msgId":70147,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNTczMzc5MTcuNzU5LllhaG9vTWFpbE5lb0B3ZWIxNDI0MDUubWFpbC5iZjEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PENBNjQ1MTExLTY1OTUtNDMzQy1BNDBELTk5ODRBNzkzQjMxNEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGtjNmxqbittbDNyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8Q0E2NDUxMTEtNjU5NS00MzNDLUE0MEQtOTk4NEE3OTNCMzE0QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":70133,"nextInTopic":70150,"prevInTime":70146,"nextInTime":70148,"topicId":70129,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"________________________________ From: Sandra Dodd  To: AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com Sent: Friday, January 4, 2013 11:36 AM Subject:","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-991077603\">________________________________<br/>\n From: Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Friday, January 4, 2013 11:36 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Siblings calling each other bad names<br/>\n   <br/>\n <br/>\n   <br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;And when an unschooled kid goes to school, I think it&#39;s entirely reasonable for the mom to say (preferably in advance, or as soon as a problem might arise), &quot;If school is going to make you mean, you shouldn&#39;t go,&quot; and &quot;I can&#39;t allow you to bring meanness from school into the house.&quot;&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow is this accomplished?  How can you &quot;not allow&quot;?  Will there be consequences if he does?   This is the BIGGEST part of radical unschooling (parenting) I am having trouble with.    Some posts make it sound like a child can do whatever makes him happy.   Other posts speak of not punishing.    Other posts talk about limiting kids from jumping on other peoples furniture.      I am not able to differentiate between no punishment, no consequenses,no limits and being able to &quot;enforce kindness&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;...It doesn&#39;t matter.

I was not so eager about this, but I did let him go and watched my son learn some new things from being with other children. He got some good friends, but his way of speaking to his brother changed in a way that I am not  happy about.
