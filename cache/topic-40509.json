There are lots  <br/>\nof copies available used and very cheap - just barely more than the  <br/>\nshipping cost.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a summary of the book:<br/>\n<br/>\nPediatrician Klenman and child psychiatrist Jellinek believe that too  <br/>\nmany well-meaning parents take food and rules far too seriously for a  <br/>\nchild&#39;s own good. While the food choices children make are sometimes  <br/>\ndreadful, parents should not act as food police. Instead, all would do  <br/>\nwell to place food choices in proper perspective: children are not  <br/>\nmiddle-aged people, their nutritional needs are different from  <br/>\nadults&#39;, food is (usually) not a life-and-death issue for them, and  <br/>\none or two not so nutritious meals will not hurt them. Therefore,  <br/>\nsuggest the authors, kids shouldn&#39;t worry about cholesterol or feel  <br/>\nguilty because they enjoy a candy bar. Although some parents may  <br/>\nbelieve otherwise, these doctors declare studies have shown that  <br/>\nbanning sweets is counterproductive. Children, they say, should be  <br/>\noffered choices and encouraged to try new foods. This is a sensible,  <br/>\nwell-written and unhysterical approach to what some may consider a  <br/>\nparental nightmare: children who have minds of their own when it comes  <br/>\nto food. In addition to questions most often asked by parents, the  <br/>\nauthors also provide in-depth discussion of food safety, food  <br/>\nallergies and eating disorders.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Nov 26, 2008, at 10:25 AM, Sandra Dodd wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; During that time, maybe read all this:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/food\">http://sandradodd.com/food</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And maybe read it all (and there&#39;s a lot of it) again in a month or<br/>\n&gt; so.

So heres where reading that led me<br/>\n <br/>\nKeeping weight a non-issue is just as important for kids who are thinner<br/>\nthan average as it is for any other kids.  Im 5 4 ½ and usually weigh<br/>\nbetween 106-112 pounds.  Other than a few years when I was having babies<br/>\nI have always been very thin, and I have always heard much more than I<br/>\nwould like to about it (although never from my parents, thankfully).<br/>\nPeople call me skinny or say Im scrawny or, and this really happened <br/>\na man I had never met before, at a party, as I walked away to get food <br/>\nthat Im built like a carrot stick. I think I can honestly say that not<br/>\na month of my life (since I was old enough to remember) has gone by<br/>\nwithout at least one comment about my size.  That had some serious<br/>\naffects on me when I was a teenager.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I was about eleven I was at a friends house. We were making dinner<br/>\nwith her mom.  My friend said something about me being skinny and her<br/>\nmom said, Shes not skinny, shes thin.  Thats one of my first<br/>\nmemories of thinking about how the words we choose matter.  I was<br/>\nreminded of that moment yesterday. Dagny and I were watching the clip<br/>\nthats all over the internet of Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg making<br/>\nmashed potatoes (dont ask me why  apparently if I see a link enough<br/>\ntimes I will eventually click on it) and Martha called Snoop skinny.  He<br/>\nsaid, Im athletically built. Thats what you call this.   I filed<br/>\nthat away for future use.  <br/>\n <br/>\nRecently at a homeschooling gathering a mom said to me, What do you<br/>\nthink about food?  I said, I love food. I think food is good.   Of<br/>\ncourse, she wasnt asking whether I liked food, but what I thought about<br/>\nlimiting food. My answers the same either way. <br/>\n <br/>\nPeople grow in all sorts of shapes and sizes and will have different<br/>\nshapes and sizes in different seasons of their lives.  Thats not<br/>\nsomething to worry about.  ~Rue<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: weight gain, six year old","postDate":"1227718548","msgId":40554,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI0N0NGMDI2LTk2QjAtNDExMy1BMkU0LTY3NUQwMUQxRkYwOUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDkzNjAxNi41NjAxNC5xbUB3ZWI1MzkwNy5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDkzNjAxNi41NjAxNC5xbUB3ZWI1MzkwNy5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":40553,"nextInTopic":40555,"prevInTime":40553,"nextInTime":40555,"topicId":40509,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Another way to limit sweets without limiting is to ask what he would like with his cake.

They usually go through a growth spurt at  <br/>\nthe same <br/>\n&gt; time, but Wyl (9) is heading into one, now, where Storm (4) seems <br/>\nto be  on his <br/>\n&gt; usual path. Up until Wyl was around 6, he was *very* thin-to the <br/>\npoint  that <br/>\n&gt; I was starting to get concerned. He had also had a very long <br/>\n(years) period  <br/>\n&gt; where he barely grew at all. A few months after his &quot;thinness&quot; had <br/>\nseemed to <br/>\n&gt; get  extreme and I was really getting worried, he really started <br/>\ngetting round <br/>\n&gt; in the  middle. He got a good-sized belly and then suddenly grew <br/>\nseveral inches <br/>\n&gt; and  evened out. His growth spurts have been much more even since <br/>\nthen (not <br/>\n&gt; so much  gap between them and not so much variance in the <br/>\nthinness/chubby belly <br/>\n&gt;  department), but the pattern remains: eat then grow.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I think partly because we trust him to know what his body  needs <br/>\nfood-wise <br/>\n&gt; and partly because we&#39;ve not commented (within his hearing) on  his <br/>\nbody size, <br/>\n&gt; along with talking about nutrition information regularly with him  <br/>\nand among <br/>\n&gt; the family, he has a healthy food concept. As his dad and I are <br/>\nboth  <br/>\n&gt; overweight, I occasionally worry that they (more Wyl than Storm) <br/>\nmight develop  weight <br/>\n&gt; problems, but then I remember that they have an *entirely* <br/>\ndifferent  <br/>\n&gt; relationship with food *and* their bodies than either one of us <br/>\ndid/do - plus,  even <br/>\n&gt; though I am obese, I like who I *am* and that is very, very <br/>\nimportant in  the <br/>\n&gt; scope of things.

They usually go through a growth spurt at  the same <br/>\ntime, but Wyl (9) is heading into one, now, where Storm (4) seems to be  on his <br/>\nusual path. Up until Wyl was around 6, he was *very* thin-to the point  that <br/>\nI was starting to get concerned. He had also had a very long (years) period  <br/>\nwhere he barely grew at all. A few months after his &quot;thinness&quot; had seemed to <br/>\nget  extreme and I was really getting worried, he really started getting round <br/>\nin the  middle. He got a good-sized belly and then suddenly grew several inches <br/>\nand  evened out. His growth spurts have been much more even since then (not <br/>\nso much  gap between them and not so much variance in the thinness/chubby belly <br/>\n department), but the pattern remains: eat then grow.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think partly because we trust him to know what his body  needs food-wise <br/>\nand partly because we&#39;ve not commented (within his hearing) on  his body size, <br/>\nalong with talking about nutrition information regularly with him  and among <br/>\nthe family, he has a healthy food concept. As his dad and I are both  <br/>\noverweight, I occasionally worry that they (more Wyl than Storm) might develop  weight <br/>\nproblems, but then I remember that they have an *entirely* different  <br/>\nrelationship with food *and* their bodies than either one of us did/do - plus,  even <br/>\nthough I am obese, I like who I *am* and that is very, very important in  the <br/>\nscope of things.

I have  <br/>\nalways in the past put controls on his eating (at which I cringe when  <br/>\nthinking about after what I now know) such as only &quot; healthy foods&quot;  <br/>\nand sugary things very limited, organic foods, etc.  So, as you can  <br/>\nexpect, now that I say &quot;yes&quot; to things he asks for, he is really  <br/>\nhaving fun.  He has been eating LOTS of cookies, ice cream, cake,  <br/>\netc.  I have been preparing monkey platters (but realize I need to  <br/>\nget more creative) but he prefers the fun foods at this time.  What  <br/>\nconcerns me is not what he is eating because I do realize balance  <br/>\nwill take some time as he was pretty controlled for his whole life  <br/>\nbut more of &quot;how long will this last&quot; before he balances out.  What  <br/>\nconcerns me most is his health and frankly, he is gaining weight at a  <br/>\nnoticeable rate.  My husband is really concerned because he struggled  <br/>\nwith weight issues himself at my son&#39;s age and worries that our son  <br/>\nwill too.  As a mom, it is hard for me to watch him gaining weight so  <br/>\nfast and instinctually not do anything about this!  However, as I  <br/>\nunderstand it, if I put the controls back on it will keep going...and  <br/>\nI really believe that at some point it will balance out...just at  <br/>\nwhat cost to his health and weight.  I hope I am not sounding  <br/>\nsuperficial b/c, truly, I&#39;m not...  We&#39;ve been practicing unschooling  <br/>\nsince the beginning of October.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I&#39;d really appreciate any help, insight, advice or comments you  <br/>\nhave as I really respect your ideas and love Always Learning!<br/>\n  -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40696,"nextTopicId":40677}}
