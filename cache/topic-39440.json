That<br/>\nsaid, I think it depends on what you liked about Avatar and what you<br/>\nthink you would like to see in other shows.  I think that anime in<br/>\ngeneral is what you want, but there are lots of different shows.<br/>\nAvatar is funny with a lot of physical humor.  It also has a<br/>\nquest-like plot and a lot of action.   My kids like Avatar, but they<br/>\nare pretty young and they like the episodes with the humor and goofing<br/>\noff, not the plot or the battles... so for us going from Avatar to<br/>\nCowboy Bebop would be nuts :)  Princess Mononoke too... it&#39;s just too<br/>\ndark for them and not what they like right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I would recommend checking out Naruto and if you post and explain<br/>\nmore about what you like I can come up with some more names.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, it took me a while to realize this but the guy who does the<br/>\nvoice of Ang also does the voice of Pablo (the blue penguin) in The<br/>\nBackyardigans.  The American version, at least.  I looked on youtube<br/>\nto find a sample and I found someone with an australian accent and<br/>\nthat is not him.
