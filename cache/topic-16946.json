This<br/>\nis not an easy task.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou need to know why she doesn&#39;t watch her kids.

Is she sitting around her house watching Jerry<br/>\nSpringer because she doesn&#39;t know how to interact with the kids?  Is she<br/>\nreally watching Jerry Springer or is she just too busy doing things that<br/>\nhave somehow become too important to keep her eye on the kids (like<br/>\nhousework)?  Maybe she just can&#39;t handle the stress of two little ones.  Or,<br/>\nmaybe she never had any good parenting role models and just doesn&#39;t know<br/>\nwhat to do.

She <br/>\nalso walks people out to their car, at night, alone, or with Janene, and <br/>\nthey are fine.  I have begun to think I need to let her handle more <br/>\nthings alone, llike going into a store and buying a few items, with me <br/>\nwaiting.  We&#39;ve sorta done that a few times, but it&#39;s been small stores <br/>\nand I&#39;ve been wary a lot.  Lexie is very self sufficient and is like <br/>\nRain, not a victim at all. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know things can happen.

OTOH, other girls<br/>\n&gt; are taken from their bedrooms at night. There are 150 stranger abductions<br/>\n&gt; of children every year in the US (according to the Elizabeth Smart show<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;re watching right now) and that&#39;s really, really rare. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am very aware of that.  Stranger stuff is almost nothing, people you <br/>\nknow stuff is all the time.  We talk about this on a regular basis. <br/>\n<br/>\nI want to raise strong girls who respect themselves, are strong enough <br/>\nto say no under difficult situations, can handle themselves in many <br/>\ndifferent situations, and know how to protect themselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a condo and there is a courtyard area with grass and trees in <br/>\nfront of the condo, surrounded by other condos, no access by cars.  The <br/>\ngirls play there all the time, no adult out front. I often sit at my <br/>\ncomputer and watch/listen to them, and they call up to me &quot;Oh Wise <br/>\nTalking Window, we&#39;re thirsty/hungry can you bring us something to <br/>\neat.&quot;  &quot;Oh Wise Talking Window, when will dinner be ready.&quot;  But <br/>\nsometimes I&#39;m in the bath or in the backyard, and that&#39;s OK cause they <br/>\nknow their boundries.  Up until last year I wouldn&#39;t let Janene go out <br/>\nalone, she had to have Lexie with her.  Now Janene can go out alone, as <br/>\ncan, of course, Lexie.  Janene and Lexie also can go from our garage, <br/>\nthrough the alleyway, to the courtyard, with bikes or ride toys or <br/>\nwhatever, alone.  They do have boundries, but Lexie&#39;s are larger than <br/>\nJanene&#39;s. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the park where we go on Wed, they often get out of site.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nmind cause they are usually with a group of kids or at least a buddy.  <br/>\nIf they don&#39;t reappear in 10-15 minutes I find them visually.  Janene I <br/>\nwatch more closely but she sticks closer. <br/>\n<br/>\nKids need freedom to grow and learn.  I used to know kids who were never <br/>\nout of their parent&#39;s eyesight until they were 10-12 years old, and then <br/>\nwow, did those kids misbehave!  They had never made their own decision, <br/>\nhad any responsibility or dealt with anything strange or upsetting so <br/>\nthey had no basis for making good decisions. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was raped as a kid. I know that can happen, too. But my life was very<br/>\n&gt; different than Rain&#39;s is - I exuded &quot;victim&quot; and &quot;good girl&quot; and<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Catholic, prone to guilt&quot; vibes. Rain walks with confidence, she doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; put up with crap like I did, because I was worried about hurting the<br/>\n&gt; other person&#39;s feelings. I don&#39;t think seeing some guys dick would scare<br/>\n&gt; her. She did have some guys offer her pot once, and handled it fine  -<br/>\n&gt; she said &quot;No&quot; in sort of a &quot;Duh!&quot; tone and walked on. I also like the<br/>\n&gt; author Tia mentioned, Gavin DeBecker...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know there are no guarantees in life, and everyone has to weigh the<br/>\n&gt; risks and make their own decisions. Still, I think people tend to<br/>\n&gt; overestimate some risks (like that of abduction or assault by a stranger)<br/>\n&gt; and underestimate others (like sexual assault by a family member).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And speaking of no guarantees in life... a woman I knew killed herself<br/>\n&gt; yesterday. She had three daughters, the youngest is Rain&#39;s age. They&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; all done shows with Rain at one time or another.

We live on a farm in the middle of<br/>\nnowhere, where of course she&#39;s free to go anywhere, but we spent a lot of<br/>\ntime in Davis (college town, maybe 70K) and Woodland (more ag, maybe<br/>\n50K). When we lived in the bay area (Alameda) and she was 7 or 8, she&#39;d<br/>\nwalk a block to the coffee shop by herself. In Tucson... well, when it&#39;s<br/>\n110 degrees, walking anywhere isn&#39;t something you really want to do, at<br/>\nleast 8 months out of the year, but she&#39;d mall-wander with a friend.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know things can happen. Midsi Sanchez lived in Vallejo, maybe  30 miles<br/>\nfrom Davis (she was the 8 yr old taken on her way home from school who<br/>\nescaped when her abductor went to get a black garbage bag by taking his<br/>\nkeys, unlocking her chain, and flagging down a truck). OTOH, other girls<br/>\nare taken from their bedrooms at night. There are 150 stranger abductions<br/>\nof children every year in the US (according to the Elizabeth Smart show<br/>\nwe&#39;re watching right now) and that&#39;s really, really rare. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was raped as a kid.
