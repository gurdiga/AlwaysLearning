And guess whose mother had the EXACT experience. He <br/>\ngot humiliated in class for it, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took a stupid online IQ test for Julian to understand that he was very <br/>\nsmart. I guess he needed someone or something who didn&#39;t love him to tell him <br/>\nin a way he could believe. Periodically we still get stories we didn&#39;t know <br/>\nabout school, and I&#39;m so sad. He never told us until recently that they <br/>\ndissected a work in the second grade. This is my early ethical vegetarian son <br/>\nwho wouldn&#39;t eat Skittles.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway...anyone here ever read Math: Facing an American Phobia, by Marilyn <br/>\nBurns? Incredible book about the way math is taught.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn, who is sad and teary writing this stuff<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9042,"nextTopicId":9112}}
