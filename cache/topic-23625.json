So those siblings are somewhat removed from that parenting stage of their lives, though many of them are still involved in different school alumni activities. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  When we first moved so far away from our families, I was slightly hesitant. On my husband&#39;s side, Jack is the 18th grandchild, plus there are an additional 7 great grandchildren. On my side he is one of 8 grandchildren. And here he is living in Florida as an only child. Sometimes I feel a little guilty about him being alone, but in the end, I think it all balances out. When we go up we have a lot of people to see, and many cousins, and Aunts & Uncles to connect with. We usually just have time to play, not compare notes or get caught up in differences in our belief systems.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  As for your children and your mil, that sounds like a difficult situation. Maybe you could start out with just a weekend. I&#39;m that would be hard considering the distance; however at least it isn&#39;t long enough for her to enroll them in school! :)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  ~ Marianne<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Yahoo!

My name is Marianne, I <br/>\nam writing from St. Augustine, Florida. My husband John and I have <br/>\nbeen unschooling my son Jack for 5 years now, he&#39;s 5. :) <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it was right around the time that Jack turned two that people <br/>\nstarted asking me if he was in school. I just respond with a strange <br/>\nexpression on my face, &quot;He&#39;s only 2!@#*!?&quot;  Next I would share the <br/>\nfact that it didn&#39;t matter anyway because we were homeschooling. Now <br/>\nI always get questions like, &quot;So, when are you going to start?&quot; <br/>\nor &quot;Are you still doing that homeschooling thing?&quot; or &quot;What about <br/>\nalgebra?&quot; Ugh! So now I just casually tell people, &quot;Oh, yes, we have <br/>\nbeen homeschooling for 5 years now and it is going wonderfully.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAt times it can be a challenge because we have relatives spending <br/>\n$10,000 a year, per child, on early education....$10,000 for <br/>\nkindergarten!!!!???? I say, just go out and play in the mud, it&#39;s <br/>\nfree! It does not help that my husband&#39;s family is from the Mainline  <br/>\nPhiladelphia and have all had a prep school education...I think my <br/>\nson will be the first who will not be attending the same school as <br/>\nall the other males in the family...not just not attending that <br/>\nparticular school, but not attending school at all. That seems to be <br/>\ndifficult for many people to accept. I guess it is not surprising <br/>\nthat people, both family and some old friends of ours, find <br/>\nit &quot;helpful&quot; to quiz Jack on things when we visit. It&#39;s as if they <br/>\nare taking an inventory of his knowledge. <br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose the fact that we live a few states away does make it <br/>\neasier. As does the fact that our families are made up of some very <br/>\nwonderful people. I believe that as Jack gets older and his <br/>\npersonality shines through, they will all begin to trust the <br/>\ndiscussion we&#39;ve made.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, well then, I guess that was a lengthy introduction... hmmm ... <br/>\nperhaps I needed more of a sounding board as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking forward to meeting everyone and reading all your views as <br/>\nwell as sharing my own.<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Marianne</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23629,"nextTopicId":23645}}
