Is it academic type homework or is it therapy exercises?<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought I read that your son was not keen on doing the homework. That is <br/>\nthe important issue. Maybe you could talk to the counsellor about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s easy when you have been in a schooling situation for a number of years, <br/>\nto start believing that experts have more knowledge than your own heart, and <br/>\nyour child&#39;s self-knowledge - that they must and should be deferred to in <br/>\nall things. One of the big parts of home schooling, even unschooling, is the <br/>\nchoice to renounce the assumed superiority of experts in our lives and take <br/>\nresponsibility ourselves for our choices and decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I are responsible for our daughter&#39;s education. We are not <br/>\npushing off the responsibility to schools and teachers. Nor are we blaming <br/>\nall kinds of external forces for anything that might go wrong either. It is <br/>\nour responsibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecoming your child&#39;s advocate, when school culture has spent many years <br/>\npushing you to be a school collaborator at best, silent witness at least, <br/>\nand finding the courage to stand up to experts (like the counsellor) about <br/>\nyour child&#39;s happiness, is harder than going with the familiar flow.  You <br/>\nhave taken the first steps by renouncing CAVA (whatever that is).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you should consider whether or not the emotional problems such as <br/>\ndepression that your son was suffering might have been all bound up in, <br/>\nmaybe even caused by, his school experience. *If so* keeping a big part of <br/>\nthat schooly experience in his life, fueled by the counsellor, might be <br/>\ncounterproductive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if it would be possible to find a new therapist who is more <br/>\nunderstanding and informed about alternative education and natural learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; It&#39;s far from serious dance class, like you describe your daughter is <br/>\ndoing. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nEvidently I didn&#39;t make my daughter&#39;s dance class description very clear <br/>\neither. The class itself is certainly not &quot;serious dance&quot; - it is creative <br/>\nmovement for self expression and in the younger years it is pretty much ring <br/>\naround the rosie to music. There is a lot of play and improvisation. But <br/>\nthey do all learn a dance for the family recital. Often the kids help with <br/>\nthe choreography.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that&#39;s not the point I was making. I wasn&#39;t making a judgement of <br/>\nwhether the class facilitator was too serious or the class too structured. <br/>\nYou younger son is enjoying himself for now, isn&#39;t he?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point I was making was to not be afraid of tears because sometimes they <br/>\nare part of the necessary process of growth and thinking through choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe goal is to be a safe place (the safest place) for your kids to talk over <br/>\ntheir quandraries and difficult decisions. Sometimes that means being <br/>\nwilling to listen while they cry about them.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

It&#39;s far from serious dance class, like you describe your daughter is doing. My son has never expressed any interest in more serious dancing, doesn&#39;t seem to be in him (while my daughter is just 2 but will probably follow the same path as your daughter, I can see). He is more of a sports and games boy-boy. He just wants to be in the group and have fun, like I see is totally appropriate in this low-key home-like place and situation. And the kids are from 6 to about 15 yrs old, girls and boys with different skills.

They had to repeat steps until she <br/>\ngot them. Jayn wonders if the girl really wants to be there, or if her Mom <br/>\nis pushing her to go for some reason of her own.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn is considering leaving, but after a lot of crying and expressing to me <br/>\nthe other night, decided to give it a try and see what happens. Sometimes <br/>\ngoing through a period of crying and sadness is needed to process feelings. <br/>\nCrying, especially supported crying, doesn&#39;t always mean that the child will <br/>\nstop, but may be the mechanism that releases enough stress to allow the <br/>\nchild to continue.<br/>\n<br/>\nNor does stopping have to mean forever. Sometimes it just means a short <br/>\nbreak until the maturity level comes up to such a point where the hoops are <br/>\nworth jumping through for the child.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease try to let go of your fear of your child&#39;s strong emotions. Just as <br/>\npeaceful doesn&#39;t always mean quiet, happiness doesn&#39;t always mean never <br/>\ncrying.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I&#39;ve brought it here and will  <br/>\ncopy the author on responses until she joins here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am new to homeschooling and after short CAVA experience quickly  <br/>\nmoved to<br/>\nunschooling my kids (6 and 17, plus little 2 :) once I found out that  <br/>\nthere are<br/>\nother legal ways for schooling in this country and state.<br/>\nWe&#39;re taking it slow now and licking our wounds. I&#39;m still educating  <br/>\nmyself and<br/>\nfinding more support.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am very happy to find Sandra Dodd who supports my understanding of  <br/>\nparenting<br/>\nand schooling my kids! Through my parenting years I&#39;ve been criticized  <br/>\nand put<br/>\ndown by my in-laws and even by my husband about my parenting ways (I&#39;m  <br/>\nfrom<br/>\nEurope and my parents and siblings and friends are far!)... but I&#39;ve  <br/>\nstood<br/>\nstrong most of the times and am very happy to find out that there ARE  <br/>\npeople<br/>\nlike me!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is starting to see that there might be a point to my gentle  <br/>\nand<br/>\nloving approach since all other has failed. He still needs a lot of  <br/>\ntime, I&#39;m<br/>\ngently surrounding him with info about unshooling and about parenting  <br/>\napproach<br/>\nvery foreign and strange to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext step will be to order your book, Sandra! I&#39;ve been just  <br/>\noverwhelmed with<br/>\nall the good info and support on your page, I think that the book  <br/>\nwould be<br/>\neasier to handle. I just need to convince my husband first about the  <br/>\nnecessity<br/>\nof this expense during these financially tough times.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many-many questions that I still have, but I&#39;ll start off  <br/>\nwith most<br/>\npressing and current one:<br/>\n<br/>\nWe go to the &quot;Estonian House&quot; every other weekend to learn my native  <br/>\nlanguage<br/>\nand to connect with other Estonians. It is very mellow and easy  <br/>\nenvironment and<br/>\nmy kids love it!<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now we&#39;re preparing for the Christmas party with songs to sing  <br/>\nand dances<br/>\nto dance. All is good and fun but the dance part... The instructing  <br/>\nlady is a<br/>\nvery sweet woman with an autistic kid and mom who is struggling with  <br/>\ncancer. She<br/>\nis wonderful to be around and the kids seem to like her too for now.<br/>\nBut her ways to instruct are very rigid and stern. She does not yell  <br/>\nor raise<br/>\nvoice, but sternly stops the whole dance and scolds once one of the  <br/>\nkids is<br/>\nmaking a mistake or getting a little giddy or bouncy. My poor Tom (6  <br/>\nyr old)! He<br/>\nis a tall kid looking older for his age and he&#39;s very lively. He  <br/>\nlearns best<br/>\nwhen moving too. Hyperactive and disruptive, they called him in  <br/>\nkindergarten :(<br/>\nwhere he developed obsessive-compulsive disorder signs when under  <br/>\nstress and not<br/>\nable to explain his emotions.<br/>\nTommy is still excited to go and dance with the group but I fear of  <br/>\nthe moment<br/>\nwhen he&#39;ll come crying and never wanting to do it again.<br/>\nWhat to do? She seems so hard for me to approach about this issue  <br/>\nespecially<br/>\nthat she is volunteering to do this. And pulling my kid out of the  <br/>\ndance would<br/>\nbrake his heart. I thought teaching him the dance by myself to prepare  <br/>\nhim, but<br/>\nit&#39;s kind of hard without the group ... and that still doesn&#39;t change  <br/>\nwho he is<br/>\nwhile dancing, that happy goof :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy teen is in a similar situation where his counselor is signing  <br/>\n&quot;homework&quot; to<br/>\nhim that my kid is not too excited to do. The counselor knows that I&#39;m<br/>\nhomeschooling now and wants to see the academics to be involved to get  <br/>\nhim out<br/>\nof being &quot;bored&quot;, while my teen is far from ready to do assignments.<br/>\n<br/>\nShoot me with any ideas or advice, please.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnel</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48504,"nextTopicId":48268}}
