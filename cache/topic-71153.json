The first example I thought<br/>\nof was sex. A decision made for yourself ahead of time can be very helpful<br/>\nwhen you are confronted with choices in the moment. This is true of many<br/>\nsubjects and choices, but it&#39;s really difficult to decide your values and to<br/>\ncontemplate future outcomes when you are in the middle of a heated-hormone<br/>\nmoment (or a peer-pressure moment, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I had decided we were done when we had our fourth child. The<br/>\nlast three had come in rapid succession and despite our attempts at a<br/>\nvariety of birth control pills. But I hated condoms. Hated them. In the<br/>\nmoment I would say &#39;forget it&#39; or &#39;it&#39;ll be fine&#39;, but I am so thankful my<br/>\nhusband was much more level-headed than I and insisted we stick to our<br/>\ndecision. Ultimately I ended up having a hysteroscopy so that I didn&#39;t have<br/>\nto deal with them anymore, but having made decisions ahead of time (for<br/>\nmyself and for us) made self-control or impulse-control in the moment<br/>\npossible, much like Pam&#39;s example with ice cream.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIf we or our kids decide that something is not right for us/them (when it<br/>\nmay be &quot;perfectly fine&quot; for others or acceptable in the society around us),<br/>\nit can often take self-control to keep from doing it when others around us<br/>\nare, or when we feel like it would be simpler or less<br/>\nembarrassing/confrontational/attention-drawing in the moment. I don&#39;t think<br/>\nself-control deserves such a bad rap.

Sometimes urges are<br/>\nbad - smacking a child, for example.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the real problem is that so many things people want to do, things that<br/>\nare actually not inherently wrong or bad, are considered urges that should<br/>\nbe controlled.  It is the same issue I have with &quot;everything in moderation&quot;<br/>\nadvice. How about we do some things in moderation, some things not at all,<br/>\nand some things with tremendous gusto and passion!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think people of impulse control as applying to things we have the<br/>\nmomentary urge to do even though we regret it later. It is really hard to<br/>\nresist the urge to eat ice cream, for example, when I&#39;m with a bunch of<br/>\npeople eating it. It takes self control. It isn&#39;t that I think it is a sin<br/>\nto eat ice cream, it is that I can sometimes handle a bit of it but other<br/>\ntimes I get painfully bloated and miserable. I know it isn&#39;t worth it, but<br/>\nat that moment sometimes I used to give in to the impulse to take the<br/>\nchance.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Self control","postDate":"1365540811","msgId":71156,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFGM0Q1NzRELTNDQ0YtNDlENS1BNkUxLTk0QzA5NDQzNTk1NEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBT09UYVhNdEszV3NQRDZDTjVSZHBrWGQ4dWRVVG8zYWlzTHFxWGo4YXZhdWRHelF4d0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDIxQzgzRjQxLThFQUUtNDNDQi1CRDFFLTA1MjYxNjg2MTY4MEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPENBT09UYVhNdEszV3NQRDZDTjVSZHBrWGQ4dWRVVG8zYWlzTHFxWGo4YXZhdWRHelF4d0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":71155,"nextInTopic":71157,"prevInTime":71155,"nextInTime":71157,"topicId":71153,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I kind of thought that the above is what impulse control means - instead of instantly reacting without thought, consider options and make a choice.-=- I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1774784663\">-=-I kind of thought that the above is what impulse control means - instead of<br/>\ninstantly reacting without thought, consider options and make a choice.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI think &quot;impulse control&quot; has an added overlay of &quot;if it feels good, don&#39;t do it&quot; ï¿½the idea that human instinct and urges are sinful, and only religious or cultural rules should be followed.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Self-control,&quot; too, I think is probably based on that idea that humans have a base, sinful nature and that those urges must be *controlled.*<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":504505579,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Self control","postDate":"1365536701","msgId":71155,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBT09UYVhNdEszV3NQRDZDTjVSZHBrWGQ4dWRVVG8zYWlzTHFxWGo4YXZhdWRHelF4d0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIxQzgzRjQxLThFQUUtNDNDQi1CRDFFLTA1MjYxNjg2MTY4MEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDIxQzgzRjQxLThFQUUtNDNDQi1CRDFFLTA1MjYxNjg2MTY4MEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":71153,"nextInTopic":71156,"prevInTime":71154,"nextInTime":71156,"topicId":71153,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Because I listen to non-fiction about human behavior, this came up today:  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Willpower Instinct: How Self-Control Works, Why It Matters, and What You Can Do to Get More of It<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir description used the chilling (for me) phrase &quot;the new science of self-control.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the reviewers wrote:  &quot;Why did the sales of Big Macs increase at MacDonalds when they added salads to the menu? The answer is here and it will surprise you. I can&#39;t say enough about the impact this book has had on me. Whatever you are struggling with, stopping smoking, curbing your spending habits, losing weight, this book will help you to understand will power and provides many tools and insights that are invaluable.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo doubt the sale of Big Macs increased partly because someone who wanted salad was willing to go with a friend who bought a Big Mac, but even if they tested people who went alone, and said &quot;We have salad now.  You can only eat so much, and you only have so much money.  What do you want to eat?&quot; I think everyone here could see some reasons people would choose the Big Mac.  The smell would permeate the building; salads smell like water and maybe vinegar.  The reality of most people limits and deprivation make some things seem way more valuable than others, and few will buy a big salad AND a burger meal. And the burger has lettuce and tomato and I-don&#39;t-know-what in it (I know the burgers at Blakes and Wendy&#39;s, but I can&#39;t recite McD or Burger King, because that&#39;s not where I go for a burger).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when it comes to choosing food, I think it&#39;s great when it&#39;s a choice (tainted or not) and not as great when it&#39;s &quot;self control&quot; (the food of a happy wild person vs. the food of a sad-but-controlled person, whose greatest happiness might now be that he&#39;s the one doing the controlling).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway...<br/>\nTwo years ago at Julie Daniel&#39;s LiTTLe conference, one of the speakers spoke at length about impulse control.  He used the term a dozen times in his talk and a couple of times in the Q&A session with all the speakers.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen someone is controlling his impulses, or controlling himself, there is a bad guy and a good guy.  With impulses, it&#39;s his good self controlling his bad self.  With self control, it&#39;s similar.  It&#39;s his ideal self controlling his actual self.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut with making choices, it&#39;s a whole person making rational, thoughtful decisions from a range of options, as many times a day as he can remember to do so.  Every decision can be made in light of as many factors as the person can gather to mind.  Sometimes the decision is, should, be one thing.  The same kind of decision on a different day with different factors might be another way another day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not so pre-decided.  It&#39;s flexible and logical.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose for a few years here we might be hearing people say &quot;But what about the science of self control?&quot;   Just a heads up for those who might be here for a few years helping others.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71148,"nextTopicId":71145}}
