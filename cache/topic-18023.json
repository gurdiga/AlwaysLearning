But since you asked;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI do censor what my children read, to an extent. Here is why. I do this for <br/>\nthe same reasons that I censor what they watch. I do not allow them to watch <br/>\nmovies where people are having sex, or running around naked. <br/>\nMy daughters are 11 and 14.<br/>\nI watched Matrix Reloaded, which they wanted to see. There was one scene <br/>\nWhere Keanu and the woman were having sex. They can&#39;t watch it. I just think <br/>\nthat <br/>\n(my opinion only) those types of things are inappropriate for my daughters. I <br/>\nlove horror movies. They are my favorite, but I will not allow them to watch <br/>\nmost of them because of the sex. The same thing goes for books.<br/>\nMy favorite books are by Stephen King and Anne Rice. There are sex &quot;scenes&quot; <br/>\nin books as well.  Romance novels (like from Harlequin) have parts that are <br/>\npretty much porn. They do not need that kind of information at their ages, in <br/>\nmy <br/>\nopinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not just say &quot;NO!&quot; I read the entire book, or watch the entire movie, <br/>\nfirst. Then I make an informed decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt their ages, I no longer worry about the violence in movies. They have been <br/>\nraised away from such stuff as much as possible, so that is not a factor for <br/>\nmy daughters. They know it isn&#39;t real, they know it isn&#39;t okay, they can <br/>\nwatch <br/>\nit. So far, there have only been two movies, without sex, that I have not let <br/>\nthem watch, and both had explicit pictures of murdered children that I found <br/>\nvery disturbing. One was a Jack Nicholson movie, and the other was a <br/>\ndocumentary (2 part), Paradise lost, about a true case.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister, though, puts no such limits on my nephew (9 years) about even <br/>\nviolence, and he has watched Matrix Reloaded. So every parent is different I <br/>\nguess.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps,<br/>\nShannon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18017,"nextTopicId":17926}}
