Sarah doesn&#39;t write much yet but she draws pictures and <br/>\nthen narrates the story to me.  We have dozens of these books (I <br/>\nsave them all!).<br/>\n<br/>\nA few days later we were at the bookstore and she brought an Usborne <br/>\nbook to me and asked, &quot;Is this &quot;Romeo and Juliet?&quot;  And it was--a <br/>\nwonderful version telling the story in short chapters and modern <br/>\nlanguage with wonderful illustrations.  We bought it and went home <br/>\nand read it (and read it again and again).  I then told her that <br/>\nShakespeare wrote lots of plays and there are movies to rent and she <br/>\nand her sister (age 5) began chanting &quot;More Shakespeare, More <br/>\nShakespeare.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, we are waiting for the movie with Olivia Hussey to arrive in the <br/>\nmail tomorrow from Netflix.
