The other sounded like one parent waiting quietly until the other parent was too harsh and then criticizing that.  &quot;Constantly.&quot;  (Not my word choice.)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust the slight shift of being pro-child rather than anti-spouse would make a big difference, as long as it can be done in such a way that it doesn&#39;t feel like a tug-of-war with the child as the rope.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day, Keith and I washed a cat.  Twice.  In a sink full of warm water.  It feels good to do something like that together.  Washing a cat is kind of a big deal.  The cat went along with it because she had somehow been rolled in a serious amount of poo, and it had dried.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany situations with our kids have been that kind of teamwork, without the poo (usually), and it felt good to work together to have a cool result and a happy child.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the relationship between parents is antagonistic, it&#39;s the same as any kind of antagonistic arrangement.

It wouldn&#39;t have been as nice.   David&#39;s a good man and wouldn&#39;t have been a child abuser if I hadn&#39;t been around but he would have parented in pretty much the same way as his parents.  Not horrible, but not as good as it could have been.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI coaxed David a lot.  I talked with him about parenting and about talking nicer to and about Dylan.  I talked with him about being more positive.   When he seemed stuck in negative thinking I asked him to stop a moment before he said the thing he was about to say and think of three or five (or some number of) positive things first.    It helped him.  And it was better for Dylan. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I also paid attention to what worried David.   If he was only seeing Dylan watch TV and it was bothering him, I tried to change things up.  I&#39;d offer games in the evening when David was home or a walk down to the river.   Paying attention to David&#39;s concerns helped me not be complacent.  I love TV but TV shouldn&#39;t be the best thing in a kid&#39;s life.   Our life at home was happy and peaceful but it was good for me to remember to think about whether Dylan&#39;s life was also interesting and stimulating.    <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce David thought Dylan ought to have a math book.   I told him to look for one he liked, and wanted to do with Dylan, and that maybe they&#39;d have some fun.   He never did get a book or make Dylan do math problems but knowing he was worried about it helped me.     When Dylan counted his money or tallied the score in a game or built a something or other I made a point of telling David all about it.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI think you can help a partner be a nicer parent or get closer to unschooling without fighting.  If you can, I think you should.  I don&#39;t regret helping David get more comfortable with unschooling.   I didn&#39;t expect him to just accept my crazy ideas and stuff down any concerns he had.
