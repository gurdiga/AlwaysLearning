Anyway, you email really","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1500444457\">Heidi,<br/>\n<br/>\nHi!  I&#39;m Susan, I&#39;ve been lurking here for a couple months, just reading <br/>\nemails and not having time to post anything lately.  Anyway, you email really got <br/>\nme going this morning.  I just got out of the daycare business after 8 years, <br/>\nand I can totally relate to what you are saying.  Daycare is such a sad thing <br/>\nand I regret that my oldest child went to daycare as a baby.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really tried to do an excellent job at daycare and I&#39;m sure most people in <br/>\nthe daycare business try to do that too, but in my opinion (and it&#39;s just my <br/>\nopinion, I don&#39;t want to get flamed) daycares are just not a good thing at all <br/>\nfor kids.  First off, you get kids that are separated from their siblings from <br/>\nbirth on up and they never get to know their siblings or form lasting bonds <br/>\nwith them.  Secondly, kids that are in daycare all day long, never form a <br/>\nstrong bond with their parents.  Thirdly, these kids in daycare are so starved for <br/>\nattention, that they will do anything to get a few seconds of attention from <br/>\ntheir tired parents at the end of the day, and it&#39;s usually something bad that <br/>\ngets Mom and dad&#39;s attention.  The behavior and what they try to do for <br/>\nattention gets worse and worse as they get older.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe cost of daycare keeps going up, and society leads parents to believe that <br/>\nthey can&#39;t get by on one income, or it&#39;s not OK to stay home with your kids <br/>\nbecause then they don&#39;t get the &quot;social skills&quot; that they need to survive in <br/>\nthe &quot;real world&quot;, so parents pay the high price to send their kids to daycare to <br/>\nget some &quot;socialization.&quot;  The parents end up strapped for cash because <br/>\nusually one income goes to just paying the daycare bill and if there&#39;s any left <br/>\nover, it goes to feeding the kids fast or convenience foods (also expensive) <br/>\nbecause they are just too tired and worn out from work to want to deal with making <br/>\na meal, and that&#39;s all their kids will eat because that&#39;s mostly what they <br/>\neat at the daycare center. <br/>\n<br/>\nI look back at some of the sad situations I had with daycare over the years, <br/>\nand I wonder how some of those kids are going to turn out.  Last night on our <br/>\nlocal news here in MN, there was a report on how kids in daycare are more <br/>\nlikely to grow up to be criminals.  What gripes me about stuff like that is that <br/>\nit&#39;s always turned around into becoming the daycare&#39;s or school&#39;s fault that <br/>\ntheir kids turn out this way, it&#39;s never the fault of the parents that dumped <br/>\ntheir kids off and never paid attention to them.  So anyway, I didn&#39;t mean to <br/>\nget off on a tangent, but I have seen over the years what happens to kids in <br/>\ndaycare and I just don&#39;t feel it&#39;s a good thing for our society and I can see why <br/>\nyou are saddened by your niece and nephew being in daycare.

After crying about it to my mom, <br/>\nmy mom told the owner that her daughters should be allowed to play with <br/>\nwhoever they wanted, especially each other.

When I <br/>\nasked her for details, she explained that no matter how she&#39;s tried at <br/>\nhome, Sarah just won&#39;t use the toilet.  I reminded her that since Sarah <br/>\nwas about 4 wks old she&#39;s been with kids her own age all day long and <br/>\ntreated that if she doesn&#39;t act like them, she&#39;s going to be in trouble. <br/>\nSo now, at home, the only other kid is her little brother and no one&#39;s <br/>\ngiving him a hard time about using a diaper.  My sister did agree with <br/>\nme that harrassing one child and not the other did seem unfair.  Then <br/>\nshe went on to tell me that at daycare, at specific intervals during the <br/>\nday, the children in Sarah&#39;s room all go sit on their potty&#39;s.  Can you <br/>\nimagine???  When she told me of that all I could think of was circus <br/>\nelephants being trained to sh-t in the parking lot before the show.  To <br/>\nbe honest, it just makes me feel sick that my neice and nephew and how <br/>\nmany other kids are being trained like animals.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of this is a surprise to me.  I just feel so angry about it.  And <br/>\nnow my sister is mad because I questioned her about it.
