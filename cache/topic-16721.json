Perhaps<br/>\nlater when our kids are older, and we have the money,<br/>\nwe will consider getting it again for the range of<br/>\ninteresting and entertaining things it brings.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur kids get some allowance.  I would like to be able<br/>\nto give them .75 to $1 a week/yr of age, but we cannot<br/>\nafford that right now.  My husband, our sole income,<br/>\nhas been out of work in this lame economy for over 7<br/>\nmonths.  There is an illustration for you of where a<br/>\ncollege degree gets you.  It&#39;s get you a loan that you<br/>\nhave to defer while you are on unemployment.  However,<br/>\nwe do give them several dollars once a month and we go<br/>\nspecifically to a &quot;General Store&quot; sorta like Walmart,<br/>\na little of everything, so they can get themselves a<br/>\nlittle something.  That&#39;s about as much as we spend on<br/>\nluxuries for ourselves, relatively, so we feel it&#39;s<br/>\nfair.  Food luxuries are in a different budget and I<br/>\ngenerally make everything from scratch so my labor is<br/>\ninvolved.  For candy they have a jar that gets filled<br/>\ntwice a month and they can eat it all in a couple of<br/>\ndays or make it last.  Usually they choose to make it<br/>\nlast.  If one of them wants to eat it all and the<br/>\nother wants to make his last, then they split it in<br/>\n1/2 and the sugar craving one eats his half.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to power, we ask them to have responsibility for<br/>\nsome of the chores around the house (mainly picking up<br/>\ntoys and clothes) and they also help voluntarily<br/>\nsometimes with cooking, dishes, stacking firewood, or<br/>\nother chores.  We only exert &quot;parental authority&quot; when<br/>\nit involves safety, destruction of our things, or<br/>\nabusive behavior.  We talk about what being a family<br/>\nmeans in terms of helping each other, sharing<br/>\nresponsibilities, supporting each other in all ways,<br/>\nand being together.  We talk about fairness when they<br/>\nwant us to do their share or they are making more work<br/>\nfor us and refusing to help with it; like refusing to<br/>\nhelp clean up mud and soap and whatnot (from &quot;potion<br/>\nmaking&quot;) in the bathroom sink that has clogged up the<br/>\ndrain; or making a big food mess from spills or<br/>\nplaying in the kitchen and refusing to help clean up. <br/>\nFor the most part we don&#39;t have to even ask, but when<br/>\nthey need reminding, they are really reasonable about<br/>\nhelping out most of the time.  We don&#39;t often pull<br/>\nrank unless it&#39;s behavior so bad they get physically<br/>\nremoved from the room or house until they are ready to<br/>\nbe human.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Money & Power","postDate":"1066492970","msgId":16764,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3Zi4yMjA1ZDUyNy4yY2MyYmUyYUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16744,"nextInTopic":16783,"prevInTime":16763,"nextInTime":16765,"topicId":16721,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/18/03 7:49:48 AM, jlist@redjellyfish.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-47454451\">In a message dated 10/18/03 7:49:48 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jlist@...\">jlist@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  I keep forgetting that unschooled kids won&#39;t necessarily react the same <br/>\nway as I did in situations involving money.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nor about just about anything else, I&#39;ve found with mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI reported here a while back that the first week Kirby had his license and I <br/>\nwas letting him go out and he had the go to be gone overnight or all day, he <br/>\nkept coming back!!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had permission to be out until midnight when I was a teenager, I would <br/>\nNOT have risked stopping by the house for anything, lest my mom take it back.  <br/>\nAnd if I had permission to be out overnight, I would have stayed out overnight <br/>\neven if I had to sleep in the car, because such freedoms were rare.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there was Kirby, in his own bed, the first night he had permission to keep <br/>\nthe car out overnight.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said he was too long for his friend&#39;s couch now, and it just wasn&#39;t going <br/>\nto be comfortable.

They&#39;ve been really honest with <br/>\nus, I think directly because we&#39;re not cruel or inflexible about money.  A <br/>\ncouple of weeks ago Marty was going bowling with some other homeschoolers, and at <br/>\nthe last minute Holly wanted to go. I handed Marty $40.  He brought back <br/>\nchange and accounted for everything.  They&#39;ve always done this, and because <br/>\nthey&#39;re so careful and precise, we trust them with money they same way we would <br/>\ntrust ourselves.  By that I mean if I were to have gone bowling with them so I <br/>\ncould pay for things, it would have cost even more (at least a soda for me) but <br/>\nwe&#39;ve always discussed what&#39;s good use of money and they know if they bring <br/>\nback change they&#39;re more likely to get money in the future without problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis might sound lame, but it&#39;s almost like once we got the goodness-siphon <br/>\ngoing, it just keeps going on its own power.  Each act or decision builds on <br/>\nthe last.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know that this could work with people who already have a bad <br/>\nrelationship with a child, but with starting from birth, I&#39;ve seen it work well in <br/>\nlots of families<br/>\n<br/>\nTrust and openness.  Honesty and generosity.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth Marty and Holly have been known FREQUENTLY to talk me out of spending <br/>\nmoney when we&#39;re out.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast Sunday we left for a three+ hour car ride to my sister&#39;s.  Holly and <br/>\nKirby said it was too early to eat, they weren&#39;t hungry. I took <br/>\napples/cheese/nuts in the car for later, and a bottle of juice.  Everyone had water.   Keith <br/>\nwent through Burger King and he and Marty ordered food.  The others could have <br/>\nchanged their minds and ordered, but they really weren&#39;t hungry.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was a kid, if there was ANYTHING to be bought--food toys--I by god <br/>\nwanted my share.  I had a neediness my kids just have never had.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":149995806,"authorName":"catherine aceto","from":"&quot;catherine aceto&quot; &lt;aceto3@...&gt;","profile":"cat4cat15217","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Money & Power","postDate":"1066437624","msgId":16724,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNjUwMWMzOTUxMCQ2YmJmOTk4MCQ2NTAyYThjMEAyMDAyZGVza3RvcD4=","referencesHeader":"PDEwZS4yNzY1OTJiNi4yY2MxYjY1M0Bhb2wuY29tPiA8MDAxZDAxYzM5NGY3JDBhMzZjM2EwJDdkMmE0YjQzQG9lbWNvbXB1dGVyPiA8M0Y5MDg5QUUuNzAxMDdAbWFkYmJzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":16723,"nextInTopic":16725,"prevInTime":16723,"nextInTime":16725,"topicId":16721,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My 5 yo gets $5/week -- enough so that she can buy a small toy if she wants to, or save for a bigger toy (like a barbie or playdough set) in an amount of time","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-688549989\">My 5 yo gets $5/week -- enough so that she can buy a small toy if she wants to, or save for a bigger toy (like a barbie or playdough set) in an amount of time that is conceivable to a five year old.   She likes to window shop the toy stores, thinking about what she&#39;d like to save her allowance for.  The first couple of months, it seemed to burn a whole in her pocket -- as soon as she got it she wanted to spend it -- now she is more concerned with finding something that she wants to own, rather than just spending money because she has some.  I think she has about $20 saved right now. <br/>\n <br/>\nThe money isn&#39;t tied to her behavior in any way.  It is the line item in the family budget for Lydia discretionary spending, similar to the line item that my husband and I each have.  The baby does not have a line item yet. : - )<br/>\n  <br/>\n-Cat <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Dawn Bennink <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, October 17, 2003 8:30 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Money & Power<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Julie wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Another thing--do your kids get allowances?

We get a few (mostly worthless) channels on the TV--nothing we can&#39;t live without.  We&#39;ll probably still have a TV when kids come along.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, when they do come along, the issue of whether or not to expand our TV horizons will involve discussions of the advantages and disadvantages of more TV (and I feel confident that a family could come to some kind of consensus on that), but it would also be a discussion about money.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you involve kids in these kinds of discussions?  If money = power in this society, then how do we reverse this trend in an unschooling family?  Who gets to decide what we can spend money on and what we can&#39;t?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m kind of locked into this mindset of adults being authoritarian and having all the power when it comes to money.
