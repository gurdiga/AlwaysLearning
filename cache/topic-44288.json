She lives quite <br/>\nfar from us in the next county and her mother would never  voluntarily <br/>\nagree to her leaving home.  Otherwise she would be more than welcome to <br/>\nlive here (but her mother knows that so we&#39;re not a secret safehouse).  <br/>\nShe has a great friend who understands and whose family is very sweet <br/>\nand loving, who include her in their family but it&#39;s the same thing... <br/>\nher mother knows about them (I think).<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is not an unschooler.
