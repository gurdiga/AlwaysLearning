One idea that startled me was in the &quot;Money and Self Control&quot; article - that our supply of &quot;self control&quot; dwindles the more we use it, until it can be refilled somehow. That struck me as being a useful concept. I think of kids being in a state of self control (eg at school, out of the house, visiting cranky grandma) finding it increasingly difficult to maintain the control and needing the recharge time. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, I know that psychology is an interest of people here, and thought some folks may enjoy some of the articles, or arguing with some of them. There seem to be a reasonable number of footnotes and citations, as well as links to studies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
