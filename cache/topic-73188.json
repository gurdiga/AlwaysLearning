If a child is playing with others getting the notes right is important. It impacts everyone in the group.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; so is telling him he is playing an incorrect note something that is <br/>\n&gt; deemed negative and showing him i am unhappy with him?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m confused by your asking. *He* know there are right notes and wrong notes. *He* knows it&#39;s important to play the right notes. Why would you pointing out what he knows he needs to get right be about you at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; because neither one of us [yet]  can hear a wrong note, i am the one who points it out.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure how you&#39;re pointing them out if neither of you can hear them?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, anyway ... As with learning anything, if he can&#39;t catch when he&#39;s doing something wrong himself, it will be harder for him to fix it. When a child is learning something for himself, noticing when something&#39;s wrong will come naturally when he&#39;s ready to focus on that area. A parent can help if they notice something getting in the way of what a child wants to do, but it should be an *occasional* thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when a child is voluntarily learning something that impacts others -- like playing in an orchestra -- mom pointing out his mistakes is getting in the way of him learning to sense what he&#39;s doing right and wrong. Right now he&#39;s dependent on you and not developing the confidence that he can notice. Unless I&#39;m missing something that&#39;s special about this instrument at a young age, he needs a way to notice when a note is wrong so he can correct himself. That would be something to ask his instructor about.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":338578919,"authorName":"","from":"&lt;mypersonalmessages1@...&gt;","profile":"mypersonalmessages1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] May I please ask your assistance?","postDate":"1389339485","msgId":73246,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGxhbzgwdCtkNzU0bjNAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNCQkI0MThCLTg0MjItNEY3OS1BQTA4LTJFNTU4MUI0QURFMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGxhaTJuaysxdHVlaGFtQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPENBT09UYVhQZEFRUXVwdFJUMGd2VnNmQnVUZmhpTEFTTHJNaHM4OFY5WEtINzFWZENiQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JPEQ0OUFDQUIxLTNENkEtNDY0Qy04N0UzLUM3NkMzNTk3QjE4RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPGxhbG9qditsMjhoY2FAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPiA8bGFuZWFyKzdmcG1hY0BZYWhvb0dyb3Vwcy5jb20+CTwzQkJCNDE4Qi04NDIyLTRGNzktQUEwOC0yRTU1ODFCNEFERTFAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":73244,"nextInTopic":73247,"prevInTime":73245,"nextInTime":73247,"topicId":73188,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"yes, he plays in a youth symphony orchestra and the conductor is terrific with the children and is very supportive. he does like practicing, and we do do it","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-531245243\"><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-531245243yiv8997906474yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1389314198545_11149 ygrps-yiv-531245243yiv8997906474yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1389314198545_13054\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-531245243yiv8997906474yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1389314198545_7149\" style=\"font-family:Georgia;\">yes, he plays in a youth symphony orchestra and the conductor is terrific with the children and is very supportive. &nbsp;</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-531245243yiv8997906474yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1389314198545_11149 ygrps-yiv-531245243yiv8997906474yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1389314198545_13054\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-531245243yiv8997906474yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1389314198545_7149\" style=\"font-family:Georgia;\"><br></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-531245243yiv8997906474yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1389314198545_11149 ygrps-yiv-531245243yiv8997906474yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1389314198545_13054\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-531245243yiv8997906474yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1389314198545_7149\" style=\"font-family:Georgia;\">he does like practicing, and we do do it together.&nbsp;</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-531245243yiv8997906474yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1389314198545_11149 ygrps-yiv-531245243yiv8997906474yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1389314198545_13054\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-531245243yiv8997906474yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1389314198545_7149\" style=\"font-family:Georgia;\"><br></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-531245243yiv8997906474yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1389314198545_11149 ygrps-yiv-531245243yiv8997906474yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1389314198545_13054\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-531245243yiv8997906474yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1389314198545_7149\" style=\"font-family:Georgia;\">but therein is the rub...because neither one of us [yet] &nbsp;can hear a wrong note, i am the one who points it out.&nbsp;</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-531245243yiv8997906474yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1389314198545_11149 ygrps-yiv-531245243yiv8997906474yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1389314198545_13054\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-531245243yiv8997906474yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1389314198545_7149\" style=\"font-family:Georgia;\"><br></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-531245243yiv8997906474yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1389314198545_11149 ygrps-yiv-531245243yiv8997906474yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1389314198545_13054\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-531245243yiv8997906474yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1389314198545_7149\" style=\"font-family:Georgia;\">i am trying to understand the ideas here...so is telling him he is playing an incorrect note something that is deemed negative and showing him i am unhappy with him?

She played around with it and learned how to make nifty sounds, and do cool tricks. *In the process* she learned a lot of the basics about how to play the guitar. When she decided to take lessons her guitar teacher thought it amusing that she could do some really advanced stuff but there were some basics that she didn&#39;t know how to do. The point, though, was that when *she* found her progress hampered by not knowing something, *she* was then motivated to put time into learning it. Before that the skills weren&#39;t helping her do what she wanted to do.

food.&nbsp;</p><p>My husband is also a very fast eater. &nbsp;We both thoroughly enjoy the act of stuffing our faces quickly. &nbsp;We also know how to slow down appropriately (like at a fancy
