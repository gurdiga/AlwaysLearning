But I&#39;d also have better options  <br/>\navailable. Some kids can absorb the idea as well as parents that they  <br/>\ncan&#39;t learn unless they use a textbook. Taking away the textbook  <br/>\nmight feel like &quot;I don&#39;t care if you learn math or not.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nZoombinis is a great math game. Cooking. Video games. Puzzles. Board  <br/>\ngames.<br/>\n&gt; I am reading history non-fiction several days a week, as well as an  <br/>\n&gt; evening read aloud of novels.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLet them choose what they want to hear. But treat it as a family  <br/>\ntogether time rather than a necessity in their learning. If they want  <br/>\nto hear Stephen King&#39;s &quot;The Shining&quot; then that&#39;s what it should be :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might reassure them that they can choose anything in the library.  <br/>\nSome kids can pick up that it&#39;s like an unspoken test to see how well  <br/>\nthey&#39;ve absorbed what they &quot;should&quot; be reading.<br/>\n&gt; The girls read several hours each day. They bike, play in the lake,  <br/>\n&gt; play some computer games, and watch a very little bit of tv.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSelf chosen to watch a little bit of TV?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might want to read:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/tv\">http://sandradodd.com/tv</a> and<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joyfullyrejoycing.com\">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com</a> (down the right hand side is a section  <br/>\non TV).<br/>\n&gt; That has been that I read fiction for about an hour after breakfast,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about discussing a day&#39;s schedule? And discuss it again later to  <br/>\nsee if it needs tweaked?<br/>\n&gt; the girls do table work until lunch with my being available to help  <br/>\n&gt; them with anything.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about crafts at the table?<br/>\n&gt; They use a textbook for math and a grammar text or workbook. They  <br/>\n&gt; have history and science books (that I selected) to read individually.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about puzzle books? Playing a game together?<br/>\n&gt;  After lunch I typically read science and/or history, or we watch a  <br/>\n&gt; video (again, my selection).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of great TV shows (especially on cable) that are science.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t *need* to do that, but it might be a way not to feel you&#39;re  <br/>\nyanking the rug from beneath them. If a home goes from structure to  <br/>\n&quot;Do anything you wish,&quot; it can end up being like a stampede.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt depends on personalities, of course.<br/>\n&gt; The girls take dance almost every day during the week. The ballet  <br/>\n&gt; studio is BIG in their lives. We also all take knitting classes  <br/>\n&gt; once a week which have now become more of help for their projects  <br/>\n&gt; with two ladies in a lovely knitting shop. We go to the library  <br/>\n&gt; once a week, and three of the girls carry out a stack of fiction.  <br/>\n&gt; The other girl says she never finds anything she likes, although  <br/>\n&gt; she reads heavily from our home library.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know that if I didn&#39;t schedule anything, life would seem much  <br/>\n&gt; like it is this summer, which the girls all describe as &quot;vacation.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWould feel like vacation to who? To you? To the girls? Would  <br/>\npermanent vacation be a bad thing?<br/>\n<br/>\nOur Puritan roots says so! But if you look at the lives of long time  <br/>\nunschoolers, what people imagine will happen with permanent vacation  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t. Kids aren&#39;t vegging in front of the TV. We are natural  <br/>\nlearning machines. We&#39;re naturally curious about life. What  <br/>\ninterferes with that is school and being made to learn before we&#39;re  <br/>\ncurious about something.<br/>\n&gt; They would still read lots, although I&#39;m not sure if they would  <br/>\n&gt; willingly make a switch to reading non-fiction because they&#39;ve  <br/>\n&gt; relied on me for that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you don&#39;t really know.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd would it be a bad thing?<br/>\n<br/>\nConventional wisdom says yes. But is someone who is made to be well  <br/>\nrounded a better person than someone who has the freedom to explore  <br/>\nwhat interests them?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we project the &quot;freedom to explore&quot; onto schooled children,  <br/>\nparents know they&#39;d never voluntarily do math or science or  <br/>\nliterature or whatever the child hates. And they&#39;d be right because  <br/>\nthose subjects have been made cringeworthy by *school* forcing it on  <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in real life, there are parts of everything that will interest a  <br/>\nchild. While my daughter isn&#39;t a science nut, she does enjoy sciencey  <br/>\ntv programs and science experiments. On her own she does a lot of  <br/>\ndrawing and playing guitar and talking to friends, but because  I  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t make her learn science and I find something interesting, she&#39;s  <br/>\nhappy to watch it with me.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know if I should make some kind of announcement, along the  <br/>\n&gt; lines of &quot;Let&#39;s just keep doing what we&#39;re doing this summer,&quot; or  <br/>\n&gt; whether I should just not say anything and simply not schedule  <br/>\n&gt; things as I have been doing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDepends on their personalities.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they had a choice, would they choose vacation or going back to a  <br/>\nschedule? Whatever, do that, and ease towards greater freedom to  <br/>\nexplore.<br/>\n&gt; When I&#39;ve t;ried to wean myself away from the schedule before, the  <br/>\n&gt; girls have told me they prefer having a weekly list of things to  <br/>\n&gt; accomplish.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling doesn&#39;t mean no schedule. Schedules help us accomplish  <br/>\nwhat we plan to do! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat isn&#39;t conducive to unschooling is imposing a learning schedule  <br/>\non kids.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s obvious to me that they are relying on me for structure, that  <br/>\n&gt; they are relying on me to provide too much in the form of assigned  <br/>\n&gt; reading and read aloud selections.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nStart asking more. It&#39;s okay if they don&#39;t know at the beginning.  <br/>\nThey&#39;ve absorbed that there&#39;s a right way to learn and you asking  <br/>\nmight feel like putting the burden of doing it right onto them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut maybe some are more bold and will be happy to take up the freedom  <br/>\nto choose and can help ease the rest.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I wouldn&#39;t expect them to structure their days. Limitations can  <br/>\nsometimes be freeing. When you can do anything you want anytime you  <br/>\nwant, some people freeze up and don&#39;t know how to choose! Maybe help  <br/>\nthem make lists of *fun* things they&#39;d like to do and help them make  <br/>\ntheir own schedule to accomplish them.<br/>\n&gt; I have no problem with the read aloud. To me, it&#39;s been great and I  <br/>\n&gt; absolutely love that time of our day. But I am bugged that they  <br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t finding their own interests, and yet I recognize that I  <br/>\n&gt; created this by the schedule I have imposed. They all have come to  <br/>\n&gt; depend on that schedule too much. I would love it if our lives  <br/>\n&gt; could continue as they have during the summer, with some  <br/>\n&gt; artificially imposed structure (dance times, knitting classes,  <br/>\n&gt; library trips), but I would love it if the girls would find their  <br/>\n&gt; own interests to pursue, other than reading fiction.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nExpectations can be happiness killers. If they can&#39;t do it, they  <br/>\ncan&#39;t. But be there to help them. Be their support. Help them start  <br/>\nlists of what they&#39;d like to do and like to explore. And it&#39;s okay if  <br/>\nthey drop them. They *should* be dabbling right now.<br/>\n&gt; So, what&#39;s the recommendation for how a long-time homeschooling  <br/>\n&gt; family can make the shift to becoming unschoolers?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nRule of thumb is deschooling takes 1 month for each year of  <br/>\nschooling. Getting unschooling can happen easily or take longer.<br/>\n&gt; Do I talk to the kids about what I am thinking? Do I move back to  <br/>\n&gt; our house in September and just not schedule table time and plan a  <br/>\n&gt; structured program of books for the girls to read on various non- <br/>\n&gt; fiction topics?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t announce anything but you could start talking about  <br/>\nunschooling as you would to a friend. And I think the less control  <br/>\nyou have over what they do the better. I wouldn&#39;t require them to  <br/>\nread non-fiction at a particular time, but doing a science experiment  <br/>\nor cooking project or something after lunch (or whatever) might help   <br/>\nyou maintain a variety of flow through their lives. If you see the  <br/>\ndifference. You don&#39;t need to do science experiments, but if you have  <br/>\na hard time not falling into a rut, being mindful of the variety of  <br/>\nthings you can do, can help.<br/>\n<br/>\nAsk for their input.<br/>\n&gt; The recommendation we&#39;ve received has been to review, review,  <br/>\n&gt; review. She can&#39;t handle money or tell time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nApparently the review isn&#39;t working ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s often a recommendation, but most therapists are trying to get  <br/>\nkids onto a school schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless of delays, learning can&#39;t happen without interest.

And  <br/>\nunschooled kids choose not to read when they aren&#39;t yet  <br/>\ncomprehending. If an unschooled child is sitting reading a book they  <br/>\n*are* comprehending on some level, otherwise why would they waste  <br/>\ntheir time? (Though not all &quot;not reading&quot; is &quot;not comprehending&quot;.  <br/>\nSome kids have other things they&#39;d rather do with their time! ;-) But  <br/>\nin school kids can&#39;t choose to not read.

I have four daughters, ages 15, 13, 12, 11.....plus four grown children ranging from 21 to 30 who were all homeschooled, two all the time and two for a few years.     Because homeschooling in an eclectic style has been what has gone on in our lives since we took our oldest out of school in 1988, I am, shall we put it mildly, somewhat stuck in my ways and we have a definite pattern of life.   All of these girls were adopted internationally at various ages, and they&#39;ve had some issues to work on in terms of adjusting to our family.    They&#39;re doing great in terms of attachment.     One has developmental delays and one has a congenital medical issue.    The other two are healthy and on target developmentally.     <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I can pull myself to truly make the shift away from formal table time, how would you recommend I approach this with the girls?     We are currently spending the summer at our cottage in Canada, where we are on a definite vacation schedule (for us).      Three of the girls are still engaged in finishing their Saxon math books.    I am reading history non-fiction several days a week, as well as an evening read aloud of  novels.     The girls read several hours each day.  They bike, play in the lake, play some computer games, and watch a very little bit of tv.    We return to our Montana home at the beginning of September, and the assumption is that we&#39;ll get back in gear, with the regular structure.    That has been that I read fiction for about an hour after breakfast, the girls do table work until lunch with my being available to help them with anything.    They use a textbook for math and a grammar text or workbook.    They have history and science books (that I selected) to read individually.   After lunch I typically read science and/or history, or we watch a video (again, my selection).     The girls take dance almost every day during the week.    The ballet studio is BIG in their lives.    We also all take knitting classes once a week which have now become more of help for their projects with two ladies in a lovely knitting shop.    We go to the library once a week, and three of the girls carry out a stack of fiction.    The other girl says she never finds anything she likes, although she reads heavily from our home library.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI know that if I didn&#39;t schedule anything, life would seem much like it is this summer, which the girls all describe as &quot;vacation.&quot;    They would still read lots, although I&#39;m not sure if they would willingly make a switch to reading non-fiction because they&#39;ve relied on me for that.      I don&#39;t know if I should make some kind of announcement, along the lines of &quot;Let&#39;s just keep doing what we&#39;re doing this summer,&quot; or whether I should just not say anything and simply not schedule things as I have been doing.     <br/>\n<br/>\nI should add that the girls feel considerable pressure from all of their &quot;schooled&quot; friends.    They keep getting told all the same things that the older kids were told ---- &quot;You&#39;ll never go to college if you homeschool&quot; ---- even though their older, always homeschooled sister is in her final year at Smith College and their older, always homeschooled, brother went to a four year state college (Evergreen in Olympia, WA) without any problems.    When I&#39;ve t;ried to wean myself away from the schedule before, the girls have told me they prefer having a weekly list of things to accomplish. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s obvious to me that they are relying on me for structure, that they are relying on me to provide too much in the form of assigned reading and read aloud selections.     I have no problem with the read aloud.   To me, it&#39;s been great and I absolutely love that time of our day.    But I am bugged that they aren&#39;t finding their own interests,  and yet I recognize that I created this by the schedule I have imposed.      They all have come to depend on that schedule too much.     I would love it if our lives could continue as they have during the summer, with some artificially imposed structure (dance times, knitting classes, library trips), but I would love it if the girls would find their own interests to pursue, other than reading fiction.     <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what&#39;s the recommendation for how a long-time homeschooling family can make the shift to becoming unschoolers?     Do I talk to the kids about what I am thinking?     Do I move back to our house in September and just not schedule table time and plan a structured program of books for the girls to read on various non-fiction topics?     <br/>\n<br/>\nThrown into all this mix is that our fifteen year old is developmentally delayed.   If she were in school she would clearly be labeled borderline retarded. She has a tremendous language processing disorder that is complicated by the fundamental developmental delay.    We adopted her (and her sisters) from China, and we have no medical history on the girls.   We strongly suspect that our 15 year old may have neurological problems stemming from either an accident or birth injury, or it is also possible that she may have fetal alcohol issues.    Whatever, the therapists we&#39;ve consulted have told us that it really doesn&#39;t matter what caused the developmental delays, we would be doing the same thing.   The recommendation we&#39;ve received has been to review, review, review.     She can&#39;t handle money or tell time.   She reads fairly well, but comprehension is absent.       She can&#39;t retell a story to save her life.    She is very aware of her learning difficulties, and she compensates by being very social and funny, but it is hard to be a 15 year old who clearly can&#39;t do some fundamentals.   I also have to limit her computer access because of her lack of judgment in terms of communicating with people in chat rooms.    She was getting online in the middle of the night, so we put a password on the computer to keep her off at night.    If she were of something remotely close to normal intelligence, I wouldn&#39;t have been as worried, but she is in many ways a perfect candidate for victimization.   I don&#39;t have any confidence that if I don&#39;t schedule work with her that she would be able to make any progress in the fundamentals (time, money).<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElaine in Montana<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38880,"nextTopicId":38905}}
