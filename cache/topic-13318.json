We live<br/>\nin Tokyo and dd and I were on visiting my family in Sao Paulo, Brazil.<br/>\nFirst I want to thank every one of you for sharing your views and<br/>\nexperiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of you already know that I am a second generation Japanese-Brazilian,<br/>\ndd is 8 yo and her father is Japanese.  We have been unschooling since 3<br/>\nyears ago and that I belong to this list since it was created 2 years ago. I<br/>\nhave not been able to keep up with the volume of the post of the list but<br/>\nwhenever I have a chance I read some of it.  Deb has been very kind to let<br/>\nme know if there is a discussion going on that are very close to our way of<br/>\nunschooling. (tks Deb!  We are back.  )<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a HSlers group here in Tokyo that promotes outings at least once a<br/>\nweek. We are at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolinginjapan.org\">http://www.homeschoolinginjapan.org</a><br/>\n.......<br/>\nDd can read and write in Japanese, but when she needs to read &quot;instructions&quot;<br/>\non how to do things, like applying for prizes advertised in comic books, she<br/>\ncomes to me or to her father. She says that there are too many words there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThinking of that, when she is reading on her own, she basically has comic<br/>\nbooks on her lap. And there in Brazil she always asks me to buy her comics<br/>\nbooks in Portuguese.  And I see her concentrated and laughing.  Once in a<br/>\nwhile she comes to me to read some passages to her.  I have found that she<br/>\n&quot;gets&quot; most of the contents.  She is not reading the words, she is &quot;reading&quot;<br/>\nthe pictures.  So I am lead to believe that &quot;reading&quot; does not have to be<br/>\nonly from &quot;letters&quot;.  Out there, there are many unschoolers that are not<br/>\nreading the words yet, and yet are able to get/have the inf he/she needs to<br/>\nlive and keep on learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI need to keep myself for pushing myself to &quot;help&quot; dd learn to read<br/>\nPortuguese.  I need to let her develop, use fully all the creative power she<br/>\nhas to understand the word.  I need to make myself know that &quot;reading&quot; is<br/>\nonly one way of understanding/expanding the world around me.  too bad that I<br/>\ngive it more value/power than it really has, when it comes to the<br/>\nunderstanding of the world around us .  I wish I become wiser and become<br/>\nable to write down about the power of understanding/expanding one&#39;s world<br/>\nunderstanding without relying on to the  written language; for the<br/>\ncompreension of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nlove and peace</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13541,"nextTopicId":13613}}
