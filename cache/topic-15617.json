Actually<br/>\nnot me personally so much, but I just witnessed the most nasty attack<br/>\n(and many others having read this other list&#39;s archives) on another<br/>\nlist she is on.

I was sadly suprised to see, no...I was shocked to see how<br/>\nshe responds to people who don&#39;t agree with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure alligator hide is enough Lynda. She has quite an enemy<br/>\ncamp going for her. How very sad that is to see. I wonder if she<br/>\nactually wrote those articles herself. I&#39;m shocked. It simply doesn&#39;t<br/>\nappear to be the same person in the articles that I see on this other<br/>\nlist, nor does it appear she practices what she so passionately<br/>\npreaches. To the contrary. I&#39;ve not seen such aggression on a list<br/>\nbefore.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh well, I&#39;ll take a deep cleansing breath and be grateful to be on<br/>\nthis list.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace to all,<br/>\nJeva</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150551601,"authorName":"Stepheny Cappel","from":"&quot;Stepheny Cappel&quot; &lt;stephc62@...&gt;","profile":"stephc621587","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Other discussion group","postDate":"1058926497","msgId":15631,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwYjYwMWMzNTBjMCQzN2Q0MjllMCQzNThjZDZkMUBzdGVwaGM2Mj4=","referencesHeader":"PGE5LjQ0ZTFmMzZlLjJjNGYzMjJiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":15629,"nextInTopic":15632,"prevInTime":15630,"nextInTime":15632,"topicId":15617,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks Sandra, I was thinking about this today as I was wandering and thought maybe they will make me do this myself LOL  Appreciate it.
