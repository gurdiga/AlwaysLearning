He did have a <br/>\ncouple of kids he did things with when he was 2/3 but stopped because <br/>\nhe didn&#39;t like the way they acted.  He really enjoys meeting people <br/>\nand will strike up conversations with a variety of adults.

He said this in a rather forceful way and I <br/>\ncould see that I was interfering with his natural ways. I think that <br/>\nwhen he said &quot;he wanted to be himself&quot; it said a lot about just who <br/>\nhe is.  He is not interested and I need to trust him on this.  We <br/>\nhave just gone about our lives.  He is free to try things if he <br/>\nlikes, he is free to decline.  I let him read the offerings at the <br/>\nlibrary, park district and homeschool group and he chooses.  Often <br/>\nhis choice is to do something just with me, sometimes the exact same <br/>\nthing that was offered in the homeschool group appeals to him but he <br/>\nis not interested in doing it in a group and he will ask me to set it <br/>\nup so he and I can do that activity.

We<br/>\nare the live-in managers of a senior citizen apartment complex on a large<br/>\nsurburban campus. Needless to say, there are no children around to act as<br/>\nplaymates. (Except for, of course, the young-at-heart ones. (C:= ) Our son<br/>\nis now approaching the age of 4 and (although he gets well with his little<br/>\nsister who is 19 mo) we would love for him to have opportunities to meet<br/>\nother kids on his own terms. We go to a lot of parks and the library (which<br/>\nhe enjoys a lot) but, when it comes to other kids, he&#39;s just not interested<br/>\nin them- at least, in interacting with them. He does love to observe,<br/>\nthough.<br/>\n<br/>\n(The other night, we went to a park in order to meet with a bunch of moms<br/>\nwho are of a Natural Parenting bent (like we are) and on the way home I<br/>\nasked him if he enjoyed his time there. His response from the back seat was,<br/>\n&quot;Well, I enjoyed the park and I liked climbing with N (his sister) and I<br/>\nliked meeting the ladies. But I didn&#39;t like the kids.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked him what he didn&#39;t like about the kids and his response was, &quot;Well,<br/>\nI don&#39;t know them.&quot; (He has met them several times at other, earlier<br/>\nevents.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I will mention is that he does get along very well with adults and,<br/>\noften, I think that most other kids around his age just seem unpredictable<br/>\nto him. He tends to be quiet around most people and keep to himself and<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t &#39;get it&#39; when other kids do things like throw toys around, yell<br/>\nthings and push or try and shoot at him with pretend guns. (Not aggression,<br/>\njust playing.) I&#39;ve got no concerns about his play skills, for those who<br/>\nmight wonder, we do get quite a bit of superheroes and pretending/role<br/>\nplaying, yelling and noise when we are at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question to you guys is this:<br/>\n<br/>\nIf (at this point in time) his natural bent appears in the direction of only<br/>\nwanting to play with his sister, by himself or interacting with adults<br/>\nshould we respect this to the point of abandoning (for now) any ideas of<br/>\n&#39;drumming up&#39; other potential kids for him to play with? Or, on the other<br/>\nhand, should we keep at it casually? The idea here would be that, perhaps,<br/>\nthe more exposures he gets to the same kids over time (so that he knows them<br/>\nand they become predictable) will make him more comfortable and willing to<br/>\ninteract with them?<br/>\n<br/>\nI will mention that (and this is probably not a good thing LOL) both my<br/>\nhusband and I are not real &#39;social&#39; people. We have very few friends we get<br/>\ntogether with and what we enjoy, most of all, is just having quiet times at<br/>\nhome with our family. Of course, I know that this is probably something<br/>\nwe&#39;ve modeled that he is picking up on, which is fine. But I am very willing<br/>\nto go out of my own comfort zone and &#39;schmooze&#39; a bit because I would like<br/>\nhim (if he desires it) to be able to have friends if he wants them. ( And I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want our homebody tendancies to dictate what he is limited by.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe would love to hear your ideas on this one.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":294520986,"authorName":"Joanna Murphy","from":"&quot;Joanna Murphy&quot; &lt;ridingmom@...&gt;","profile":"ridingmom1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Children and Friends","postDate":"1219338695","msgId":37366,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGc4azdrNytocjA5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDcyMkNFOEU2Q0VFMDQ4MkZBOUQ5QTRFRjQzMThDRDFDQEVib255Pg=="},"prevInTopic":37365,"nextInTopic":37393,"prevInTime":37365,"nextInTime":37367,"topicId":37350,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

You don&#39;t want to &quot;force&quot; your son into situations with other children, but on the other hand you don&#39;t necessarily want to have him take on your own social tendencies.  One thing I would add is that he is unlikely to be taking on your stuff because they are who they are.  Since you are providing him with opportunities to be around other children, you can be fairly sure that if he wanted to play with them he would.  Keep following his cues.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the third hand, parks can be intimidating for some children, and it&#39;s possible that he could do better playing in a home with a family that he knows well and feels comfortable with.  And on the fourth hand :-) I found with my son that he really wasn&#39;t interested in other children until he was much older--he did find them more of a bother than they were worth to him.  He really enjoyed the company of other adults, like his grandparents, who were interested in listening to him, interacting with him and letting him win all the games.  Playing with other boys at that age was fraught with conflict and competing desires.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it sounds to me like you are on the right track with how you are looking at things--keeping his preferences in mind, offering opportunities, and looking at what influences might be playing into things.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Children and Friends","postDate":"1219292878","msgId":37351,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQwOUEzQkFDLTk3QjQtNDI0RC1BRUMyLTlFOUZERDVCMDkyMkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGE0OTgzMTE0MDgwODIwMTkzOHMzYTNiNjZjY2gxZjM2MDQ5NGMxYWE5ZDI2QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGE0OTgzMTE0MDgwODIwMTkzOHMzYTNiNjZjY2gxZjM2MDQ5NGMxYWE5ZDI2QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":37350,"nextInTopic":37352,"prevInTime":37350,"nextInTime":37352,"topicId":37350,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-But I would love to know your opinions on the the matter of unschooling and a parent s (or guardian s) responsibility in terms of providing (or ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1992757161\">-=-But I would love to know your opinions on the the matter of  <br/>\nunschooling and<br/>\na parent&#39;s (or guardian&#39;s) responsibility in terms of providing (or<br/>\nfacilitating) social opportunities for the kids.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d go by his cues and clues.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I will mention that (and this is probably not a good thing LOL)  <br/>\nboth my<br/>\n<br/>\nhusband and I are not real &#39;social&#39; people.
