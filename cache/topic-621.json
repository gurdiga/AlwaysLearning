She got this <br/>\nposition right off the bat, after getting more specific about exactly what <br/>\nshe was interested in doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the young people in our unshcool group did volunteer work at a Nature <br/>\nCenter working with animals of all types. She had a mentor, a person who <br/>\nagreed to take her under her wing when she came to volunteer. She quickly <br/>\nproved herself a real assest to that community. She was eight when she began. <br/>\nOur unschool community just had a meeting on this very issue. . . and many <br/>\ngood ideas came from it. I think we have to re-educate the public on how <br/>\nhomeschoolers, and more specifically unschoolers CAN contribut and be an <br/>\nassest in these situations. They need to understand we are not looking for <br/>\nteachers, but rather opportunities to follow along and observe and <br/>\nparticipate with older people. They need to be educated that they are not <br/>\nperforming a baby-sitting service, that these young people will show up on <br/>\ntime, and contribute. Our group is considering writing a manual to have on <br/>\nhand for people interested in being mentors. We are beginning in &quot;our own <br/>\nbackyard&quot;  and trying to tap the resources of the families and extended <br/>\nfamilies and acquaintances of the unshcooling families of our organization. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also believe in asking the Universe, God, higher power, or however you wish <br/>\nto define it for what I am ready to receive, in this case a mentor. What I <br/>\nwould do is make a very specific list of the qualities of the person I am <br/>\nlooking for and ask for that person to come into our lives. That is how my <br/>\ndaughter got her position.<br/>\n<br/>\nliving in abundance<br/>\nlovemary<br/>\n<br/>\nI cannot judge my own path and SELF, having the knowledge that I have chosen <br/>\nto come here to experience these specific issues and grow, learn, and <br/>\nRemember Who I Am.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90721915,"authorName":"Susan McGlohn","from":"Susan McGlohn &lt;eclectichomeschooler@...&gt;","profile":"eclectichomeschooler","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Question about how to find mentors for children","postDate":"1008252505","msgId":621,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDExMjEzMTQwODI1LjQ4OTI2LnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0OTAyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":637,"prevInTime":620,"nextInTime":622,"topicId":621,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I know, the newbie with the all the questions :-) I have tried for many years, unsuccessfully, to find a mentor for my daughter in several areas.

We couldn&#39;t find a person willing<br/>\nto teach her the way she wanted to learn, and after a<br/>\nyear of traditional piano lessons, her love of playing<br/>\nwas virtually murdered.  Never did recover from that<br/>\none.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen art.  Sarah has taught herself, because she has a<br/>\nnatural talent.  It took us many years to find an art<br/>\ninstructor willing to teach her *real* work, and take<br/>\nher seriously, but finally, on teacher no. 3, we have<br/>\nstruck gold.  But that was by chance.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur latest frustration has been that Sarah (12yo)<br/>\nwants to become an animal rehabilitation specialist,<br/>\nand in the state of VA a person must be 18 to work<br/>\nwith wild animals (even of the rabbit and squirrel and<br/>\nbird variety).  So she raises guinea pigs and has<br/>\nstudied animals for years, but can&#39;t go anywhere else<br/>\nin the direction she wants to until she is 18.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have tried the volunteer route as well.  No go. <br/>\nShe has to be 14 to volunteer in the people hospital<br/>\nand 16 to volunteer with a veterinarian.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that people are so afraid of lawsuits that<br/>\nthey have these arbitrary rules set up to protect<br/>\ntheir own hind ends, but it is sooo frustrating! <br/>\nSarah is extremely mature for her age, both physically<br/>\nand emotionally.  She could easily do what is required<br/>\nin any of these areas, probably better and with more<br/>\ncommitment than most kids older than she.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my question is, how does one go about finding<br/>\nsomeone willing to take on a kid to mentor in a field<br/>\nof interest?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any insight!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n{}<br/>\nSusan  c[__]<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eclectichomeschooler@...\">eclectichomeschooler@...</a><br/>\nAOL IM:  WifeToVegman<br/>\n<br/>\nmy web page:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://theeclectichomeschooler.homestead.com/TheEclecticHomeshooler.html\">http://theeclectichomeschooler.homestead.com/TheEclecticHomeshooler.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nCheck out Yahoo!
