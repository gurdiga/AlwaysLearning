I have saved them and read most of them. I plan to keep going back to learn more, also I plan to check on some of them books mentioned at the library.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs for their counselors due to anxieties and some other personal issues I have not considered changing as of yet. They both have wonderful counselors, my concern was how does a single parent with no reliable income explain they are getting the experience that will teach them. I write that and it still sounds crazy to me. I know that over time they will gain knowledge of things on their own like I have read in so many articles. But putting it into words to another person seems to be hard for me to do, perhaps that is the main issue.<br/>\n <br/>\nActually my belief of natural learning is hard to be thought out because I seem to worry to much about the little things . I feel I have plenty of deschooling to still do. As far as coming across not confident enough etc, I am very bad for that and that is something I need to work on as well.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs for explaining to anyone how I intend to do things differently.  I did not mean to offend anyone and I wasn&#39;t wanting to come off that way. I just worry I may not have enough going on for them other then reading. My youngest don&#39;t care much for reading.  Honestly, I much rather do the natural learning, I see the difference already and it has only been a month since they have been out of public school. As I said I have a lot more deschooling, and growing to do I realize that.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyways, again if I offended anyone that was not my intention, and I apologize. Thank you again for your input. Off to read some more, take care.<br/>\n <br/>\nP.S. Off Topic~ If I may ask, are you still active in the SCA? I have only been involved for about a year, so I have much to learn. But I am amazed with everything we have experienced. My girls learned Drumming, and my oldest loves to forge, belly dance etc. Anyways I was interested in knowing if your family ever travels to the Kingdom of Northsheild? <br/>\n <br/>\nThank you,<br/>\n <br/>\nChristina<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and <br/>\nknow-it-all with Yahoo!
