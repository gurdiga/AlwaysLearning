It&#39;s harmful to think of it as &quot;reverting,&quot; instead of seeing that &quot;maturity&quot; and age are not smooth curves with no variations.  Sometimes adults want to be silly, and sometimes adults are stressed and feel helpless and frustrated and need help.  Sometimes a child can step up and be extremely responsible for a while, and then might want to suck her thumb and fall asleep with a lovey.  That&#39;s normal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see how the 10-20-10 formula would work for a family where the child was in school, or one of many foster children, and the parent was busy with a fulltime job or many other foster children, and it could be a helpful therapeutic tool.  And it might be helpful for the mom of the four year old who needs to take some steps back herself and bond differently.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor advice for a family where the child is home as much as unschoolers are, it seems a tiny bit of time and attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen families are separated by work and school, they might only know each other slightly, after a while.

That&#39;s a good example of what I mean by offering attention proactively: don&#39;t wait for your kid to come to you, plan on being there ahead of time. I resisted that kind of thinking at first, when Ray was little. He needed soooooo much attention and the idea of giving him more seemed overwhelming. But it made such a difference to actively choose to do it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;your child may<br/>\n&gt; be considerably younger emotionally than their chronological age<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s also fairly common for parents with their first child to have wildly unrealistic expectations as to what&#39;s developmentally normal. Kids with big vocabularies in particular can &quot;fake out&quot; parents, who expect them to understand (intellectually and emotionally) more than they&#39;re really capable of grasping. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps to assume your kids are doing the best they can with the resources they have. If your child is struggling, he&#39;s struggling!
