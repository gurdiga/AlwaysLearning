I find this sort of stuff fascinating.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the mini-thesis:<br/>\n<br/>\n==However, the results of this study indicate that individual agency prevents unschoolers from being subjugated by the powerful discourses of mainstream schooling society relating to education and success. Pierre Bourdieu (1930-2002), another French social theorist writing in the 1970s and 1980s, theorized that social relationships are created by the talk and action of individuals (Erickson and Murphy 2008:187). Bourdieu believed that individuals, not powerful systems, create symbolic capital (Erickson and Murphy 2008:188). Bourdieu&#39;s theory is applicable to the findings in this study that unschoolers have redefined &quot;a good education&quot; and &quot;success&quot; through powerful discourses (not &quot;discourses of power&quot;) and action.==<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this process of individuals redefining &quot;education&quot; and &quot;success&quot; has benefitted greatly from the technology of our day. Access to information is empowering. It encourages bravery and action. If I know I can get information on any subject in the whole wide world, and I have the confidence in my ability to find it, I no longer need experts to dispense it to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I do not think I would have ever stumbled upon unschooling - or been able to delve deeply enough into it to later choose it - had it not been for the internet. So the discourse is ever more powerful thanks to access to information, other unschoolers, and archives of past discourses.<br/>\n<br/>\n==My research on unschooling generally supports the idea that a good education leads to<br/>\nsuccess. However, the unschooler&#39;s definitions of a &quot;good education&quot; and &quot;success&quot; differ significantly from that of mainstream schooling society. For unschoolers, pursuit of the concepts and skills which are interesting and useful in living one&#39;s life is education enough to happily achieve whatever goal an individual might set for himself.==<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw Pam Sorooshian speak this summer and she emphasized the importance of keeping the little flame of curiosity alive within our kids - not snuffing out the innate desire to learn. That concept really resonated with me. I think about it a lot and sometimes ask myself, &quot;Am I protecting my kid&#39;s flame in this moment? Or snuffing it out?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nReading the mini-thesis made me want to further break unschooling down into its core concepts. For my family, it looks like:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Keep alive the flame of my child&#39;s curiosity (via loving them, patience, listening, partnering, respecting, not testing).<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Give my child access to the world (via technology, groups, friends, family, strewing, facilitating, answering questions, adventures, travel).<br/>\n<br/>\n3) The learning takes care of itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n___________________<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for sharing.
