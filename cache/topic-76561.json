Do you know if the PAL format DVD sold on their website works in the US?  Would love to be able to stream it, if possible.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI’ve sent the questions to Clara Bellar and will get back with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of points about this—it presents a more competitive, perfectionist sort of home ed.  At least one of those interviewed is against children’s use of electronic media. So while it might be inspiring and interesting, especially to someone who knows nothing about unschooling, I don’t think someone should make any one source or resource their only input.  Considering what others have done, and why should be helpful to deciding what you will do, and why.  Why should be the most important part. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere’s another film to check out, too, called Class Dismissed.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rent.classdismissedmovie.com\">http://rent.classdismissedmovie.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThey followed a family through their decision to homeschool, through their explorations, and how and why they settle on unschooling.  It’s really well done.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey’ve also set up the ability to watch all their video footage of nine intervies.  One is me and Kirby.  Deb Lewis wrote, of that:<br/>\n&quot; I really liked the extended interview with Sandra and Kirby. I liked it more than the movie, and I loved what Sandra says about the difference between learning and education.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought Linda Dobson’s parts, in the film, were great, so that’s another one that it might help to watch.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few of those interviewed for Class Dismissed would not make good members of this discussion, because they never really unschooled, or because they don’t see value in online exploration or video gaming.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFiltering through lots of information can help you clarify what you believe and why.  Part of becoming expert in anything is knowing enough, at some point, to see flaws or problems with the writings or beliefs of other “experts.”  It’s about having enough knowledge and direct experience to see the scene from above, rather than from below (in a way of thinking of it).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo people who want to really understand where they are in time and possibility, with unschooling, might want to watch both of those films.  Read several people’s unschooling books. Sort through good examples and bad examples, clear ideas, confusing or less valid statements.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIt can’t be done in the absence of children.  As you read a little (or watch a little), try a little, wait a while and watch, a body of your own certain knowledge will grow.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/knowledge\">http://sandradodd.com/knowledge</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":292060713,"authorName":"","from":"natalie.weiss.jackson@...","profile":"nabejackson","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Film:  Being and Becoming","postDate":"1453644308","msgId":76564,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG44Mmxtayt1bzRudWhAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNFQzIyQkU1LTMzMkYtNDJGNS1BMDhCLTM4OTI1OUYxMzE2MEBnbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDNFQzIyQkU1LTMzMkYtNDJGNS1BMDhCLTM4OTI1OUYxMzE2MEBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":76563,"nextInTopic":76565,"prevInTime":76563,"nextInTime":76565,"topicId":76561,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The trailer looks great.
