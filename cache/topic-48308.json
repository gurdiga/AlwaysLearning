It is not always easy, and surely my husband and I are continuously and ever-presently trying to live our lives harmoniously day to day, and many days that is a challenge. I work 32 hours a week, and sometimes more hours are required, but not too often (meaning I often draw the line with my employer even though they expect me to work until midnight on occasion--but I refuse--I&#39;ll quit at 4pm). My kids are aware of the fact that Mom is the one who works and brings in the money that provides for our lifestyle, which is decent. That said, we are highly spoiled. My mother-in-law, my mother, my sister-in-law, and my 16-yr old nephew are all are involved with the lives of my children, so perhaps we are not an example of the average family.  However, we make it work. I try to ensure that I have ample time to do what I need to do (errands, exercise, etc.) but I understand that often my kids needs come before my own. I guess, to sum it up, I am committed to making all of this work, and I feel pretty confident that it&#39;s already working. I think most families with a similar committment will make it work for them as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;goodgirl659&quot; &lt;daisyeyes@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just got a job offer with my dads company.

Many <br/>\nunschoolers have found Retrouvaille to be a marriage saver. It&#39;s free.<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.retrouvaille.org<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will be harder to unschool happily if you are also having to help your <br/>\nchildren heal from divorce, even if your then ex-dh doesn&#39;t insist on <br/>\nschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think I could unschool and work 8 hours/day outside of the home, <br/>\nunless dh was home. But then I don&#39;t have any congenial family nearby as you <br/>\ndo.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour Dad&#39;s company? Any chance for more flexibility - telecommuting part of <br/>\nthe time - fewer hours - using the childcare at the job.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t say how old your two girls are. There is a lot of difference <br/>\nbetween leaving a 13 and 14 year old with your sister versus leaving a 4 and <br/>\n5 year old.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
