It took a long time for me to understand.  In my opinion all experiences, not forced, are good.  I felt the children might like to try it and have that knowlege if in the future there was something they wanted to create they would have a tool that they could use.  The woman at the school thought it would push kids in a direction that they werent meant to go.  She gave the example that they had a student who sculpted incredible animals and if they had suggested art lessons or contests he might have become a great artist but on his own he later decided it was the bone and muscle structure that interested him so he became a vet.  I understand but do not agree with her philosophy.  I did send my daughter for 2 years to an alternative school in NJ but have since unschooled.  The school was unschooling away from home and I felt I missed out on sharing the experiences and it was expensive considering they weren&#39;t &quot;teaching&quot; the kids.  - Robin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">  --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;yngeharol&quot; &lt;yngeharol@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -=-Maybe when he&#39;s eight or older, if he wants to go, we might send  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; him.
