Big theater, balcony, full.  The Highland, on <br/>\nCentral (Rt.66) in Albuquerque.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been in theaters when the mood of the crowd was light, but that night it <br/>\nwas not.  People were disturbed, and afraid.  When the movie was over, people <br/>\nweren&#39;t chattery.  They were stunned, and spooked.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the parking at that theater is around the back, and the side streets <br/>\nare dark.  (One side has a Wendy&#39;s now, all lit up, but in those days, nothing <br/>\nopen, nothing light.)<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople seemed afraid of the dark, afraid of the big dark wall of the theater, <br/>\nafraid of each other, afraid to say anything, afraid of their cars.  <br/>\nEveryone&#39;s auras just sucked into them and they were trying to be invisible, to be <br/>\nmagically elsewhere.  Nobody was laughing about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was 19 or 20, and with three friends in my VW bug.  We were to let one out <br/>\nat his small apartment (behind a garage, not in an apartment building) and the <br/>\nother three of us would&#39;ve gone back to dorms.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe walked him in, and were afraid to leave and he didn&#39;t want us to leave.  <br/>\nWe slept two on the bed and two on the floor right  next.  Took a long time to <br/>\ngo to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe weren&#39;t feigning fear, we were bone-chilled scared.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...<br/>\nI always categorized that as a scary, disturbing movie.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of years ago, one of Marty&#39;s friends brought it over and a dozen or <br/>\nso people watched it at once.  Holly wanted to, so I stayed.   Kirby didn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to, so he went and played video games elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nNothing was scary.  The kids were laughing, pointing out the old-fashioned <br/>\nspecial effects, discussing the datedness of costumes and such.  It didn&#39;t scare <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly and I watched Psycho recently.  Holly thought it was hilarious.  It di<br/>\ndn&#39;t scare her.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the scary experience of a movie has got to be the mood of people <br/>\naround.   And is it dark and are kids alone?  Bad time for a scary movie.  Remote <br/>\ncontrol in hand so it can be paused or muted or run back?  No comparison to <br/>\nbeing stuck between and among frightened adults in a dark theater.<br/>\n<br/>\nApples and oranges, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted Marty and Holly to see The Birds because there are references to it <br/>\nin so many parody and cartoon things they know.  We watched it in daylight, <br/>\ndiscussing how they did things.  It was on DVD and there were discussions of <br/>\nspecial effects.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think when somene who was scarred and scared by seeing Jaws in a theater <br/>\ntoo young might think they need to protect their child from the same movie, but <br/>\nat home with a remote is just too different.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"J.

This society is getting more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and more immune to violence.  Rape, assaults, etc...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are increasing. We are going to war without exploring<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the possibility of other peaceful resolutions.

This<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; isn&#39;t just my opinion it is substantiated by not only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; my work, but the many, many respected  leaders in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; alternative healing community, and those in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; psychological community as well.

I can&#39;t remember the<br/>\n&gt; title, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; think 1995 movies and someone will. Anyway, I thought it was<br/>\n&gt; G or PG-ish,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and got there and realized that it was R-ish, with some fairly<br/>\n&gt; gruesome<br/>\n&gt; &gt; violence... but Rain was really liking the story so she didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; want to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; leave, so we sort of muddled through. There was a guy who I<br/>\n&gt; think got<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stabbed through the eye and died, that was my clue that this<br/>\n&gt; was maybe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not a PG movie. That was upsetting... but after that she covered<br/>\n&gt; her eyes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; during any scenes that looked potentially gory and I told her<br/>\n&gt; what was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; going on and when it was over, and that worked out okay.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If I had known I would have warned her ahead of time, and she<br/>\n&gt; could have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; been closing her eyes for the first gory part, but we did work it<br/>\n&gt; out,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and the next time I researched more, and I&#39;m pretty sure she<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; traumatized for life... okay, she&#39;s saying she was but she&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; laughing and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; admitting that she doesn;t even remember it ;-)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do none of you read the 1000 or more studies<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; showing the negative  effects on children of violence<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in cartoons, let alone the many other programs out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Actually, the studies I&#39;m aware of showed that a subset of the<br/>\n&gt; children<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in these studies became more violent after seeing violent<br/>\n&gt; shows... which<br/>\n&gt; &gt; makes you wonder what was going on with that subset. I&#39;ll bet<br/>\n&gt; none of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them were unschoolers.

I&#39;m pretty<br/>\n&gt; sure she&#39;s just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; deleted all the porn spam she&#39;s gotten, although<br/>\n&gt; once she <br/>\n&gt; commented that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the supposed &quot;hot 16 yr old&quot; had the same name as<br/>\n&gt; someone <br/>\n&gt; we knew, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; once she asked what a word meant.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; In other words, in an unschooling family the issue<br/>\n&gt; was not a <br/>\n&gt; big deal.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Have none of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you gone to what is termed a family movie and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; witnessed more violence than your child was<br/>\n&gt; ready to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; see? <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; When Rain was 2 1/2 we went to see a movie about a<br/>\n&gt; dragon, I <br/>\n&gt; think Sean<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Connery was the voice of the dragon... I can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; remember the <br/>\n&gt; title, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; think 1995 movies and someone will. Anyway, I<br/>\n&gt; thought it was <br/>\n&gt; G or PG-ish,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and got there and realized that it was R-ish, with<br/>\n&gt; some fairly <br/>\n&gt; gruesome<br/>\n&gt; &gt; violence... but Rain was really liking the story<br/>\n&gt; so she didn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; want to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; leave, so we sort of muddled through. There was a<br/>\n&gt; guy who I <br/>\n&gt; think got<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stabbed through the eye and died, that was my clue<br/>\n&gt; that this <br/>\n&gt; was maybe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not a PG movie. That was upsetting... but after<br/>\n&gt; that she covered <br/>\n&gt; her eyes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; during any scenes that looked potentially gory and<br/>\n&gt; I told her <br/>\n&gt; what was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; going on and when it was over, and that worked out<br/>\n&gt; okay. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; If I had known I would have warned her ahead of<br/>\n&gt; time, and she <br/>\n&gt; could have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; been closing her eyes for the first gory part, but<br/>\n&gt; we did work it <br/>\n&gt; out,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and the next time I researched more, and I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; pretty sure she <br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; traumatized for life... okay, she&#39;s saying she was<br/>\n&gt; but she&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; laughing and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; admitting that she doesn;t even remember it ;-)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do none of you read the 1000 or more studies<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; showing the negative  effects on children of<br/>\n&gt; violence<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in cartoons, let alone the many other programs<br/>\n&gt; out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there?  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Actually, the studies I&#39;m aware of showed that a<br/>\n&gt; subset of the <br/>\n&gt; children<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in these studies became more violent after seeing<br/>\n&gt; violent <br/>\n&gt; shows... which<br/>\n&gt; &gt; makes you wonder what was going on with that<br/>\n&gt; subset. I&#39;ll bet <br/>\n&gt; none of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them were unschoolers.

It is also not<br/>\ndenial based.  I also don&#39;t believe in censoring my<br/>\nsons natural curiousity about learning anything he<br/>\nwants to learn. If he is old enough to ask the<br/>\nquestion then he is old enough to have the answer even<br/>\nif it is a difficult topic.  At a young age of five he<br/>\nknows all about reporduction, same sex marriages, <br/>\ndeath, etc...  I have supported him in learning all of<br/>\nthis at the level he indicates he wants to know.  Not<br/>\nmore, not less.<br/>\n<br/>\n It seems that when i talk about protecting my son by<br/>\nscanning the material he has access to, the assumption<br/>\non this list is that i want to control what he desires<br/>\nto learn.  That isn&#39;t the case at all.  In fact I want<br/>\nto make it safe for him to learn what he wants to<br/>\nlearn, and not be surprised or harmed by those things<br/>\nthat he was neither looking for or ready to witness. <br/>\nOf course children aren&#39;t going to look for<br/>\npornography on the web, nor are they looking for<br/>\nviolence on tv or in the print media.  But these<br/>\nthings exist in what originally appears as the most<br/>\ninnocent of places.-  Have none of you received spam<br/>\nwith links to pornographic sites, an innocent subject<br/>\nline with a surprise on the other end?  Have none of<br/>\nyou gone to what is termed a family movie and<br/>\nwitnessed more violence than your child was ready to<br/>\nsee?  Do none of you read the 1000 or more studies<br/>\nshowing the negative  effects on children of violence<br/>\nin cartoons, let alone the many other programs out<br/>\nthere?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know that these things have lasting impact.  I have<br/>\ncounseled for well over 20 years helping families deal<br/>\nwith behaviour problems, domestic violence, and simple<br/>\nchildhood nightmares.  This society is getting more<br/>\nand more immune to violence.  Rape, assaults, etc...<br/>\nare increasing. We are going to war without exploring<br/>\nthe possibility of other peaceful resolutions.  Do you<br/>\nreally think that there is no link with premature<br/>\nexpossure to these topics and this alarming fact? <br/>\nExposure to material that a child isn&#39;t emotionally<br/>\nmature to handle can be overwhelming, and has the<br/>\npossibility of stifling rather than assisting the<br/>\nemotional/spiritual development of the child.  This<br/>\nisn&#39;t just my opinion it is substantiated by not only<br/>\nmy work, but the many, many respected  leaders in the<br/>\nalternative healing community, and those in the<br/>\npsychological community as well.  I have included a<br/>\nbasic link about the negative effects of cartoons<br/>\nalone. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aap.org/advocacy/childhealthmonth/media.htm\">http://www.aap.org/advocacy/childhealthmonth/media.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t need any of you to agree with me on this,<br/>\nhowever, i do want to make the distinction that i am<br/>\nnot censoring my son, i am censoring the media that<br/>\ntries to invade my son&#39;s natural curiosity and take<br/>\nadvantage of his desire to learn by exploiting his<br/>\ninnoscence.
