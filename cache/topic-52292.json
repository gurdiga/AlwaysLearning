When, a week or two ago, I heard him muttering about how unhappy he used to feel, and how nowadays he feels really happy, I felt so happy myself.

It is really a choice.  Presumably anyone who starts with little<br/>\nchoices will continue to relate to their children positively and the<br/>\nchildren will reciprocate, as they get older they may smoke or make choices<br/>\nwe wouldn&#39;t make for them, but if the present is any indication they will be<br/>\nreceptive to opinions from mom and dad.  They will know that people who love<br/>\nyou are repectful and anyone who uses punishment/coercion isn&#39;t interest in<br/>\na relationship built on mutual respect. That&#39;s all they know from people<br/>\nthey grew up with about love, being entwinned with respect:)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe moms who use coercion/guilt/punishment have neater houses, but I have a<br/>\nconnection to my kids based on love and trust. My partner, my kids and l<br/>\nknow one another to be doing our best and so we all are inspired to<br/>\ncontribute more to one another&#39;s contentment.  Less energy is wasted on<br/>\nnegative things--imagine how hard those mom&#39;s are working and how much less<br/>\nsatisfaction!<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately, that&#39;s what soured me on tools like NVC--its all about getting<br/>\nyour needs met, rather than assuming everyone is contributing what they<br/>\ncan.  If you have an agenda other than honesty, and love unschooling won&#39;t<br/>\nwork.  More than money and fancy trips unschooling is about connection,<br/>\nhonesty and gentle nurturing parenting.

I expect them to grow up to be pretty generous and supportive of the people they care about. I expect my kids to be pretty good critical thinkers - analytical. But the above aren&#39;t really an expectation that unschooling will produce that type of person, it is more that it is what I think our lifestyle is likely to lead to.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nYes.    <br/>\n<br/>\n~~I&#39;m not sure that there is a desired unschooled criteria--more like observations of people who have been unschooled, and a set of characteristics that they seem to share--engagement in their lives, creativity, seeing lots of possibilities.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nA &quot;set of characteristics&quot; is what I&#39;m pondering.  I&#39;m wondering if a child doesn&#39;t have those particular characteristics then how do they feel about themselves - A sort of unschooling peer pressure concept.  I&#39;m also referring to a recent blog I read and one in the past where an unschooled teen felt they weren&#39;t &quot;doing enough&quot; (for lack of better words) compared to other unschoolers.  I asked Sorscha if she felt any pressure to be a certain way because she falls under the label of unschooler.  Her reply, &quot;I am who I am and no one can change that.&quot;  So this is not the case with my kiddo.  <br/>\n<br/>\n~~I think unschooling can be practiced badly, and there&#39;s a growing numbers of lists and forums to tell people that just having your kids home is unschooling, and they&#39;re learning all the time, so parents don&#39;t need to do anything special but take care of themselves.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I agree.  I have explored out yonder.  I&#39;ve also seen bored unschooled kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, too interesting of a connection not to post.  Sorscha just said, &quot;I have so much pressure right now.&quot;  She&#39;s playing a new DS game. <br/>\n<br/>\n~~She will likely never be &quot;easy-going&quot; or sunnily happy all the time. It&#39;s not in her nature. If I try to make her be those things to live up to some ideal of what an unschooled adult *should* be like, I&#39;m not going to be much help to her.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin, you always speak to me because Michelle and Sorscha are alike in many ways.  Thank you for treading the path before me and leaving me your wonderful popcorn trail of wisdom!  I very much understand your comment and I have also known that about my daughter. <br/>\n<br/>\n~~However, if I help her be and do what she wants to be and do, if I coach her in situations where she might not do so well and would like to do better, if I see her as a whole human being now, not just in the future once unschooling is over, she&#39;ll be her own certain type of human going forward.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I have no doubt that Sorscha is and will be her &quot;own certain type human&quot; forever.   That was beautifully written Robin.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~And I want my daughter to be herself, not a copy of another unschooled kid.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nWaving hands, yes yes!  I will say that I have felt pressure to make / mold Sorscha into a copy.  Yea, I didn&#39;t go there.  Besides, Sorscha has a built-in BS detector, she would have called me on it so fast! <br/>\n~Crystal in New Mexico~</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Producing a certain type human?","postDate":"1269452253","msgId":52305,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEUyMjBCQzdFLTg4MDMtNDMwNi1BRDg3LUM5RUZGRUQ4MUU1MEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhvZGg0OCtlOWVkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhvZGg0OCtlOWVkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":52304,"nextInTopic":52306,"prevInTime":52304,"nextInTime":52306,"topicId":52292,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Maybe that s another one for that list--whatever that list is...truths that taken out of context become platitutdes?

Mad About You even had an episode that was all about getting their baby to sleep through the night. For me, that knowledge that Simon would learn from all things, and not necessarily what it was hoped he would learn, the idea of helping my infant son to learn that I wouldn&#39;t be there for him, that he needed to be independent when he was less than a month old, well, that was learning that I certainly didn&#39;t want to deliberately set up.
