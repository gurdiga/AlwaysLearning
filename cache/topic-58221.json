A few stores down, there was another one.  Different one.   And I had already mentioned to my mom that the first guy&#39;s beard wasn&#39;t real.   She quite calmly said that Santa couldn&#39;t really sit in every store, and that these guys were helpers, who got the information about what the kids wanted for Christmas.  We talked about younger kids who didn&#39;t know about fake beards thinking it was the real Santa and feeling good about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had told him I wanted a two-story dollhouse, and that&#39;s what I got.  What I didn&#39;t realize for MANY years, even after I knew Santa was a big hoax (as I thought right at first, when I found out) was that the parents were hearing the request, and that was the good part.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo even after I knew the store Santa&#39;s were just guys dressed up like Santa, I still thought for another few years that there was an original real Santa somewhere, busy getting ready for Christmas.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s a hoax anymore, though.  It&#39;s like a play, a ceremonial bit of fun.   Blowing out candles and making a wish isn&#39;t a lie.  It&#39;s just a thing people  have done for a long time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a link that&#39;s not about Santa, but about ceremony and ancient belief, and cakes: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/cake\">http://sandradodd.com/cake</a><br/>\nThat&#39;s one of my favorite pages, and has a good story about my kids when they were little, but it&#39;s not &quot;about unschooling&quot; in most people&#39;s minds.

And I said, &quot;what do you think?&quot; and he sort of told me that he thought it was us.  I just smiled and honestly I can&#39;t remember exactly what else I said, but it wasn&#39;t &quot;oh yes, he&#39;s real&quot; and it wasn&#39;t &quot;Taylor&#39;s right, it&#39;s us&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nA day or so later my son said &quot;you know, I think Santa is real&quot;.  And I (a little surprised based on what he had said previously) said &quot;why do you say that?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he said &quot;Because you guys could never afford all the stuff we get!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLet the magic continue as long as it&#39;s fun.

In the<br/>\nnote, my daughter asked the TF to please bring her a pair of wings...and<br/>\nwhen my daughter did not receive the wings the next morning, she was<br/>\ndevastated.  I pointed out that such a thing just is not possible - that if<br/>\nit were, we&#39;d likely see people flying around quite often, and surely wings<br/>\ncould be bought in stores (or at least on amazon!).  Although she understood<br/>\nthe logic, it still did not assuage the hurt she felt that she was not going<br/>\nto receive wings and that...there was, apparently, no TF.  Why she thought<br/>\nthat the TF could bring her wings, I don&#39;t know, but from there, it lead to<br/>\nher asking about whether there was really a Santa and an Easter Bunny.  And<br/>\nleprechauns.  I am an imperfect parent - I admitted that they all had<br/>\nparental assistance, except for the leprechauns, because there was just no<br/>\nway I&#39;d willingly destroy my house like that each St. Patty&#39;s Day.  I shared<br/>\nwith her the famed editorial letter from years ago, &quot;Yes, Virginia, there is<br/>\na Santa Claus&quot; which did nothing but make her even sadder.  I shared<br/>\nsomething else with her about the spirit of Christmas as well as the story<br/>\nof Saint Nicholas, and again, none of helped to ease her heartache...but<br/>\nmostly, it was that she couldn&#39;t get wings.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is, she&#39;s a very sensitive little girl - very artistic, with an<br/>\nold soul - she worries about the bad things that happen in the world, about<br/>\nthe future which might not be good, and while discussing with my friend, we<br/>\nconcluded that my daughter really *needs* something that helps her remember<br/>\nthere is still magic and purpose and joy in the world.  I asked her why she<br/>\nwanted wings, and she said that she wanted to &quot;get away from it all&quot; and<br/>\nthat she feels stressed out about worrying about her future and about money<br/>\n(even though there is no reason for her to worry about money, but her<br/>\nfriend&#39;s family has had a rather rough go of things) and things like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould it all have been better if she hadn&#39;t believed all along?  Well,<br/>\nthat&#39;s the thing - at ages 4 and 5, she was resolute in her conviction that<br/>\nSanta wasn&#39;t real, even though we fully played up the excitement.  And now,<br/>\nalthough she *knows* the truth, she still asks me, &quot;Are you SURE there isn&#39;t<br/>\na real Santa?&quot;  And my answer for her now is that, without reservation, I<br/>\nbelieve in him, even if he isn&#39;t personally the one delivering the gifts.  I<br/>\nam fairly certain that she *knows* the answer, but based on how and when she<br/>\nasks, I think she needs to hear that I believe.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was 4, my family lived on a military base in Hawaii and, on Christmas<br/>\nEve, there flew over the residential area of the base a sleigh of sorts,<br/>\nwith jingling bells and a loud &quot;Ho, ho, ho!&quot; and, from what I remember, a<br/>\nred light out in front.  Now, it *could* have been a rather elaborately<br/>\ndecked out helicopter...but nearly 40 years later, I&#39;d just rather not think<br/>\nabout it like that.  It is one of my earliest memories, and one of the most<br/>\nexciting and magical things I&#39;ve remembered from that time.  And if the<br/>\nmilitary could do then what NORAD does now, tracking Santa, then there&#39;s a<br/>\nwhole lot of something that&#39;s just wonderful about the spirit of the season.<br/>\n<br/>\nNatalie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":372124303,"authorName":"Elisa","from":"&quot;Elisa&quot; &lt;elisa29@...&gt;","profile":"elisa290772","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: How to drop the Santa myth?","postDate":"1291327577","msgId":58251,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQwOUM4MERCMTc4MTRGNzY5OUY1NkIwM0Q4RDA5NUIxQGVsaXNhMjk3MlBDPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlkODhzMyszaGhjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlkODhzMyszaGhjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58248,"nextInTopic":58258,"prevInTime":58250,"nextInTime":58252,"topicId":58221,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My 8yr old dd told me that Santa was a Myth at 4yrs old I was blown away we were in the car driving and she just announces that Santa is a Myth and she knows","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1161754906\">My 8yr old dd told me that Santa was a Myth at 4yrs old I was blown away we were in the car driving and she just announces that Santa is a Myth and she knows the real Santa is me so I was honest with her as I must admit I always hated keeping it from her anyway but she still loves Chrsitmas she like to have more say in her presents even to the point of coming shopping with me as she says why should I have all the fun going shopping...lol but she also loves unwrapping her gifts on Christmas morning she says it&#39;s just fun even if she knows what she is getting and I always have a couple of surprises anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\nElisa<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":124256069,"authorName":"Bun","from":"&quot;Bun&quot; &lt;alohabun@...&gt;","profile":"alohabun","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: How to drop the Santa myth?","postDate":"1291318991","msgId":58248,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlkOHNzZitvdmc3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDRDRjY5OEUzLjMwNjA1MDBAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":58247,"nextInTopic":58251,"prevInTime":58247,"nextInTime":58249,"topicId":58221,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

If my kids asked really direct and pointed &gt;questions, I&#39;d &gt; say, &quot;Do you want just the facts or the fun playing-&gt;pretend version?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When my first daughter was born and for her first four xmas&#39;s we put out presents and she thought Santa put them out.  We left sparkles and oats outside so the reindeer could find our house (she made this mixture at a craft time) and a note and cookies and hot tea for Santa and carrots for the reindeer.  She was happy and seemed to enjoy the experiences.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOver time though I began questioning how it felt to me to continue doing this without explaining it all honestly.  After our second son was born, I told my dh that I didn&#39;t feel comfortable keeping the truth from our kids.  Although dh thought it would have been fine to keep going along with the kids still believing in Santa, he went along with what I wished and I did begin talking honestly with them about Santa. Wish I recalled if our first child asked about whether Santa was real or if I brought it up...I just can&#39;t remember.  We still took family pics with Santa for the fun of it, sent out some cards, decorated, cut down our own tree at a local tree farm, went on drives to see the most decorated houses, exchanged gifts, put out surprise gifts for the kids, went to parades, and stuffed the stockings and did other things that were fun for  and lightings, this time of year.  It was still fun and I felt better about being honest!  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur third child was VERY uncomfortable with strangers, heck, even people we knew.  There was no way she&#39;d even want to sit with a big fellow in a red suit for a picture whether she knew him to be real or not.  But it was okay if I held her in a family picture.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSomehow my husband and her got this thing going where he&#39;d tell her that HE was Santa Claus - that was his excuse for putting on weight!  And when we were at a zoo, he&#39;d say that he was checking in on his reindeer.  She&#39;d ask me if it was Really true and I&#39;d be honest and say that it was not true and that Daddy is just joking.  He admits he is joking if either of us ask him to be honest, but I think he prefers to be vague.  I am more serious and dh is more of a joker...the ying and the yang...      <br/>\n<br/>\nLaurie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":241447822,"authorName":"thecugals","from":"&quot;thecugals&quot; &lt;thecugals@...&gt;","profile":"thecugals","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: How to drop the Santa myth?","postDate":"1291313576","msgId":58247,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlkOG5qOCtuaWU0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDRDRjY5OEUzLjMwNjA1MDBAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":58243,"nextInTopic":58248,"prevInTime":58246,"nextInTime":58248,"topicId":58221,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... --If my kids asked really direct and pointed questions, I d say, Do you want just the facts or the fun playing-pretend version? -- Last year, my","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1812613003\"><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n--If my kids asked really direct and pointed questions, I&#39;d <br/>\nsay, &quot;Do you want just the facts or the fun playing-pretend version?&quot;--<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year, my then-8-year-old daughter asked me while we were in the car alone, &quot;Mom, do you believe in Santa Claus?&quot;  I really wasn&#39;t sure what answer she was hoping for, and I didn&#39;t want to lie OR potentially spoil all her fun.

This year he told my mum that he&#39;s going to find out by looking to see if DH and I are cranky on Christmas Day so he can know if we got up in the night (he goes to bed with us so knows we don&#39;t do it then). My mum again probed to see if he wanted to know the truth (she and I have discussed our approach) but he was quite clear in the conversation that he didn&#39;t. I think for him he does really know but is enjoying the thrill of the chase, or the conversational dance around all this.

We both, to this day, will tell you that we <br/>\nheard hooves on the roof... the magic of Santa was/is that real for us despite <br/>\n&quot;the truth&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMoreover, my 4 year old dd and I watched &quot;The History of Christmas&quot; last month, <br/>\nand Santa Claus is explored thoroughly, from real man to magical character/myth. <br/>\nSo, if you intend to tell her &quot;the truth&quot;, you may want to explore this history/ <br/>\nversion as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the link: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DXS41A/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_3?pf_rd_p=486539851&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=B0007WFULA&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=18N12XXG54F7Z32H2GQP\">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DXS41A/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_3?pf_rd_p=486539851&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=B0007WFULA&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=18N12XXG54F7Z32H2GQP</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa B<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa Biesemeyer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":454093105,"authorName":"lalow","from":"&quot;lalow&quot; &lt;lalougor@...&gt;","profile":"lalow66","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: How to drop the Santa myth?","postDate":"1291222521","msgId":58224,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlkNXVscCt2ZW0zQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFEREJFOEFENDk1NjRBNzc5NUJBMzYxMjA2NzVEMEVCQENvbm5pZVBDPg=="},"prevInTopic":58223,"nextInTopic":58225,"prevInTime":58223,"nextInTime":58225,"topicId":58221,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My kids have all believed in Santa Claus.

My now 9 year old has always been dubious about it and even at 3 and 4 asked alot of questions about but how would he do this or that.  We never lied to him, always made a game out of it.  Always talked about how fun it is to believe in him etc..  I honestly thinking he has always been on the fence about it but this year when he turned 9 he said to me, &quot; I am nine now mom, I think it is time I know about Santa Claus, are you and daddy the ones that give us the presents?&quot; and I said yes.  And then we had a discussion about how the other kids (7, 7 and 5) still like to believe in him and how we can have fun with it.  My almost 8 year old, told me that he still believes in Santa, he loves to imagine things, he has a great imagination and likes fantasy and magic.  I never felt betrayed or lied to as a kid about Santa.  My parents treated it all much the same way we have.  We had fun with it all.  When I asked my mother about him, I think she was surprised I still believed in Santa.  I was about 9 too I think.  We just talked about how fun things like that are.  <br/>\nI never really believed in the Easter Bunny, not sure that my kids ever have either... just a little too wierd for me.  Big Bunny in a suit dropping eggs.  But we have always had fun with that too.  Spend days before Easter as a child planning the traps we were going to set for him.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":224796703,"authorName":"otherstar","from":"&quot;otherstar&quot; &lt;otherstar@...&gt;","profile":"casouthworth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] How to drop the Santa myth?","postDate":"1291219570","msgId":58223,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFEREJFOEFENDk1NjRBNzc5NUJBMzYxMjA2NzVEMEVCQENvbm5pZVBDPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDRDRjY2MzcxLjcwMTAzMDVAY2xlYW5mcmVha3NjYXJwZXRjYXJlLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDRDRjY2MzcxLjcwMTAzMDVAY2xlYW5mcmVha3NjYXJwZXRjYXJlLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":58222,"nextInTopic":58224,"prevInTime":58222,"nextInTime":58224,"topicId":58221,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

She is big on wanting to know facts and isn&#39;t really into magic and fantasy. My younger girls (2 & 4) don&#39;t really seem to care as long as they get presents. Whenever Santa discussions come up with my 6 year old, she says that he is real and expresses that she doesn&#39;t want anybody to say otherwise. I am pretty sure that she knows the truth but she has always loved to use her imagination and doesn&#39;t like anybody to interfere with her fantasy world. As a result, we don&#39;t do anything to destroy her belief in Santa. Every child is different. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] How to drop the Santa myth?","postDate":"1291218541","msgId":58222,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEEwQTk4M0NDLTUxQ0QtNEYzMS05MUI1LTU5QTc5RjlBQzhGN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDRDRjY2MzcxLjcwMTAzMDVAY2xlYW5mcmVha3NjYXJwZXRjYXJlLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDRDRjY2MzcxLjcwMTAzMDVAY2xlYW5mcmVha3NjYXJwZXRjYXJlLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":58221,"nextInTopic":58223,"prevInTime":58221,"nextInTime":58223,"topicId":58221,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- Anyway, up until now my wife and I have been engaging in the whole santa thing.
