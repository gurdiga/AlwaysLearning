If you install skype for each of them, it doesn&#39;t take more than a few seconds or distract you from your work much to send them messages and stickers and emojis from time to time.

If I&#39;d started the day with them, playing and giving them attention, they were happier about me getting on with other things later on. You might find it helpful to shift your day around a bit if you can, so you work more in the afternoon and give time to the children in the morning - literally putting them first. Then when you&#39;ve finished work, make time to do something with them again, go out for a walk or play a game, before starting on dinner or anything else that isn&#39;t focused on the children.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Bernadette.</div></span></blockquote></div></div></div>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Temporary slumps, and ideas about that","postDate":"1473854961","msgId":77492,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZFRUQ4M0U0LUVENjUtNEYxQS1BRUE3LTNDOUNFRTc2M0UzNEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBMDQwODlELUVDNTktNDIxMy05RUFGLTcwMTg0MTYwQTJEMEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEFBMDQwODlELUVDNTktNDIxMy05RUFGLTcwMTg0MTYwQTJEMEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":77488,"nextInTopic":77497,"prevInTime":77491,"nextInTime":77493,"topicId":77488,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Invite an older child or a teen over to play with them (maybe for some money, maybe for the joy of getting out of their own home and playing with your stuff).
