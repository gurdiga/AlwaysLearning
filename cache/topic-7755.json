My nephews and nieces, a boy,<br/>\nHunter 16, girl, Mylisa 15, girl, Lillie and boy, Evan 12, and a girl,<br/>\nEmily 11.  <br/>\nSo up went the tent, the pool, the trampoline and there seems to be<br/>\nsteady night and day activities. <br/>\nOne morning, and almost every day since, there were two extra kids here. <br/>\nI&#39;d never seen either one of them before, but they were calling me Tia<br/>\nlike my nieces and nephews do, and they seemed to know where everything<br/>\nwas.  One was making a sandwich in my kitchen and when I said - do I know<br/>\nyou ?-  he just laughed and headed out the back door.  Who knows how many<br/>\npeople I&#39;m really feeding?<br/>\nI was watching one unknown boy jump on the trampoline, he was beautiful,<br/>\nmaybe 15 and so happy.  As I was calculating whether  my homeowners<br/>\ninsurance would pay for his broken head he said &quot;watch this back flip...&quot;<br/>\n and to my horror I heard my own voice saying ok, as if that was just<br/>\nfine.  ( and it was )<br/>\nThose trampolines have warnings about severe head injury, spinal injury,<br/>\ndeath, but no kid ever reads that.  Only the parents do and we should be<br/>\nsensible like the kids and ignore it.  I can&#39;t say enough about<br/>\ntrampolines.  There should be one warning about peeing before you get on<br/>\nthough, never mind spinal injury.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe planned a three day camping trip starting with an eight mile hike to<br/>\nTrask lakes.  If any of you have been in this area the trail head starts<br/>\nat the end of Rock Creek Lake.  It&#39;s a beautiful hike and the kids, even<br/>\nthe little ones were great.  At Trask lakes though, there was three feet<br/>\nof drifted snow and no place to camp.  You just don&#39;t know how<br/>\ndisappointing that is after an eight mile hike, but we started down again<br/>\nhoping to find a good campsite somewhere along the trail.  We ended up<br/>\ncoming home, and the older kids were in bed half the next day but the<br/>\nlittle ones were out on the trampoline.  <br/>\nDeer Lodge has an event called Territorial Days every year, a kind of<br/>\nhistorical celebration with a parade and a muscle car show, street<br/>\nvendors and a street dance.  They always hold the Prison Break Run, ( the<br/>\nMT State prison is here ) and all the kids decided to enter the five K. <br/>\nEveryone of them got a medal for their age group, first place or second<br/>\nor third and I&#39;m so amazed at how easy such things are for kids, just one<br/>\nmore thing to do on a Saturday morning, and by the way, we have these<br/>\nmedals...<br/>\nWe went bowling.  No one bowls, but we still had fun.  We went four<br/>\nwheeling, or &quot;quad running&quot; as my nephew says.  We went camping, for real<br/>\nthis time, at Kading campground, near the headwaters of The Little<br/>\nBlackfoot river, where Lillie, the 12 year old perfected her fly fishing<br/>\nskills and Emily learned how to tie wooly buggers.  Dylan and I hiked the<br/>\ntrail to Blackfoot meadows, five miles and a little steep in some places.<br/>\n He scampers across streams and up the rough places like a mountain goat.<br/>\n That was a six hour hike but there was hot food waiting for us and a<br/>\ncampfire and all those fun kids.  <br/>\nTheir parents arrived Thursday, and they&#39;ve all gone off to do different<br/>\nthings and my house is so quiet these last two days.  Cleaner, but quiet.<br/>\n Dylan slept twelve hours Thursday night, I think just trying to catch<br/>\nup.  We&#39;ll have the older kids again tonight and tomorrow because my<br/>\nhusband&#39;s promised to take them out and let them drive his old truck. <br/>\nThis is a big deal, learning a shift and their destination is the<br/>\nfireworks shop at Race Track where they sell the big, noisy, terrorist<br/>\ntype, explosives.     <br/>\nEveryone leaves on the fifth, and I don&#39;t know what we&#39;ll do around here<br/>\nwithout them.
