I grew up completely<br/>\nurbanized and our dream (which we are acting on and<br/>\nhope to sson realize) is to own land and have some<br/>\nsmall agriculture and livestock (mostly for ourselves)<br/>\nand build an intentional community.  We are currently<br/>\nlooking into an option where we would almost have to<br/>\nbe homesteading in the beginning until we get the<br/>\ninfrastructure in place.  We have mostly been trying<br/>\nto teach ourselves what we will need, and I know we<br/>\nwill learn a lot in the process, but it would be nice<br/>\nto have real living people as a resource to ask<br/>\nquestions about things when we get stuck or need help.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
