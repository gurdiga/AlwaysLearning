The trouble, in a way, is that you&#39;re getting stuck moving her Away from what she&#39;s doing (have Less fun, please) - it&#39;s much, much easier to mover Toward something interesting. So look for that. <br/>\n<br/>\nDepending on her personality, you might have a bag of tricks for distracting her - bubbles, sidewalk chalk, snacks... an assortment of fun little things to occupy a few minutes and change the dynamic. Or you might swoop in merrily with a big kiss and dance her off out of the way. Or you could offer to go get ice-cream.

If your daughter is often the boisterous child who needs more attention, then it&#39;s not a good idea to volunteer to take care of other children.

My daughter (7) loves  <br/>\nto dance and she started dancing in front of the players (some of whom  <br/>\nshe knew) and was becoming very vigorous.  When I asked her to dance  <br/>\nless vigorously, she could not . . . would not . . . and the scene  <br/>\ncontinued to develop with myself and others becoming increasingly  <br/>\nuncomfortable and me continuing to ask her to dance more calmly.  I  <br/>\nalso had my smaller son (2) and another girl (6) who I was tending  <br/>\nwith cups of juice and snacks etc. One of the carers asked me to stop  <br/>\nthe children dancing as it was disturbing some of the residents (some  <br/>\nwere smiling and enjoying the dancing and some were looking  <br/>\nstrained).  In that situation I found myself stuck, unable to find a  <br/>\nsolution because I was also scared of my daughter&#39;s reaction to my  <br/>\nasking her to stop dancing.  And indeed, when I said that she must  <br/>\nstop now, she stormed off and become very angry and said she was never  <br/>\ngoing to dance again and that she hated that place. Afterwards I felt  <br/>\nas if I had really failed her and the other people in the environment  <br/>\nand I did not have any clarity about how I could have better managed  <br/>\nthe situation.  I have been in many situations where she is very  <br/>\nrespectful of all kinds of protocols but in this instance it was not  <br/>\nso.  At the time I was (and still am!) struggling quite a bit with  <br/>\nunderstanding how to speak to my daughter when I know that she is  <br/>\nsensitive to being corrected - that correction usually results in her  <br/>\nbecoming angry.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am wondering if you have any thoughts about this.
