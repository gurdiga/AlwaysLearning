Officials accused Sorensen of neglect, reporting her<br/>\n<br/>\nto California child welfare authorities, and began plans to<br/>\n<br/>\nprosecute her in the Sacramento County courts. By this time<br/>\n<br/>\nthe Sorensens were in touch with CHN and were well aware of<br/>\n<br/>\nthe requirements of the California Education Code. They knew<br/>\n<br/>\nthey had complied with the letter of the law -- could school<br/>\n<br/>\nofficials really require more than the law requires?<br/>\n<br/>\nNow school officials have taken the law into their own hands<br/>\n<br/>\nand accused the Sorensen child of truancy. They are citing<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;unexcused absences&quot;, which were in fact after his parents<br/>\n<br/>\nhad officially notified them under the law that they had<br/>\n<br/>\nwithdrawn him from public school. The Education Code does not<br/>\n<br/>\ngrant the local school any authority over private (home)<br/>\n<br/>\nschools or their students. But this has not prevented Joseph<br/>\n<br/>\nTucker, of the Student Attendance Review Board (SARB), from<br/>\n<br/>\ncalling a SARB hearing.<br/>\n<br/>\nACTION ITEM: Mr. Tucker, apparently with the blessing of<br/>\n<br/>\nPrincipal Deborah Kraus, has made it known to the family that<br/>\n<br/>\nthis would all &quot;go away&quot; if they would just enroll their son<br/>\n<br/>\nin the government-run school system. In other words, he is<br/>\n<br/>\nabusing the power of his position to intimidate this mom and<br/>\n<br/>\ndad into following HIS choice for their child&#39;s education<br/>\n<br/>\ninstead of their own. Conservatives and limited-government<br/>\n<br/>\nadvocates across the country need to stand with this family and<br/>\n<br/>\nsay to these educational bureaucrats: &quot;Enough!&quot; CLICK BELOW to<br/>\n<br/>\nquickly contact Tucker, Kraus, and the entire School Board and<br/>\n<br/>\ndemand that they stop this assault on parental rights:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.conservativehq.com/032502.htm\">http://www.conservativehq.com/032502.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAOL: &lt;a href=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.conservativehq.com/032502.htm&quot;\">http://www.conservativehq.com/032502.htm&quot;</a>&gt; CLICK HERE &lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNOTE: The California Homeschool Network Legal Defense Fund<br/>\n<br/>\nwill be paying for this fight on behalf of the Sorensens and<br/>\n<br/>\nothers.
