And girls can do both, if they like.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Only for the next couple of years during the pilot period. Then the <br/>\n&gt; program materials that are less frequently utilized will be phased out. <br/>\n&gt; They&#39;ve already SAID that the cadette and senior program materials are <br/>\n&gt; used by only a fraction of current members - so they are clearly <br/>\n&gt; already sitting on the chopping block.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The focus books are well-intentioned - but look at what&#39;s out there - <br/>\n&gt; the first focus books for girls 11 to 17 years old.<br/>\n&gt; Take Charge - talks about date rape and self-defense<br/>\n&gt; Uniquely Me - Inside and Out -- it is about style and self-esteem<br/>\n&gt; Uniquely Me - The Real Deal -- it is about having a PMA (positive <br/>\n&gt; mental attitude) to deal with peer pressure<br/>\n&gt; Looking In, Reaching Out -- it is about journaling and thinking about <br/>\n&gt; one&#39;s own feelings<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are now a few other focus books - one on writing, one on track <br/>\n&gt; and field, and one on traveling.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Contrast this to the Boy Scouts merit badges - on horseriding, <br/>\n&gt; ceramics, camping, backpacking, carpentry, beekeeping, archery, drama, <br/>\n&gt; engineering, and so on - dozens of them --- all REAL stuff to learn and <br/>\n&gt; do and THEIR booklets have actual information in them to help the kids <br/>\n&gt; learn.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The girl scout focus books take the place of earning any kind of merit <br/>\n&gt; badges - the girls buy the booklets ($5 to $6 each) and read them and <br/>\n&gt; do the activities (answer some questions, mostly) and then set their <br/>\n&gt; own goals. When they&#39;ve achieved their own goals, they can buy <br/>\n&gt; themselves a little charm - for another $4 or $5.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (I LIKE the setting their own goals aspect, by the way.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But - I have absolutely NO interest in my 12 yo daughter being treated <br/>\n&gt; to such obtrusive pop psychology by somebody who volunteers to be her <br/>\n&gt; girl scout leader. We don&#39;t share the same religion nor values in many <br/>\n&gt; areas and certainly not at ALL the same kind of approach to discussing <br/>\n&gt; these kinds of things. And - much of the material is very very <br/>\n&gt; anti-family. Even the most innocuous focus book - the one about writing <br/>\n&gt; - there is a section about how to write a persuasive essay to convince <br/>\n&gt; your parents to let you go to an all-night party. I found it very <br/>\n&gt; offensive. The attitude that parents and kids are adversaries is <br/>\n&gt; pervasive in the materials. It is assumed that all teenage girls will <br/>\n&gt; have hostility toward their parents. There is a section in one of them <br/>\n&gt; where it suggests that it IS possible that they could EVEN have fun <br/>\n&gt; with their family. The message is clear - normal teenage girls don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; like their families.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s more - but I&#39;ll stop ranting for now &lt;G&gt;.<br/>\n&gt; I was a girl scout for all of my childhood and have been involved as an <br/>\n&gt; adult for 14 years. I&#39;ve won council-level awards honoring my work for <br/>\n&gt; the organization. I&#39;m sickened by the direction the older girls&#39; <br/>\n&gt; program is moving - I was hoping to see MORE real content, not this <br/>\n&gt; pandering to the worst of society&#39;s view of teenage girls. I&#39;ve got <br/>\n&gt; THREE teenage girls (well - two plus one almost there) and this program <br/>\n&gt; is so unsuitable for them and their friends that, just reading about <br/>\n&gt; it, they were very very insulted and offended.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have no idea if teenagers who go to school will now flock to it or <br/>\n&gt; not - although I&#39;d be very surprised if they&#39;ll bother. I cannot <br/>\n&gt; imagine it appealing to girls with real lives and real senses of <br/>\n&gt; themselves. At best, it is fluff.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -pam<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Okay, I talked to Beth, my partner, who works for a GS council. What she said <br/>\nis that different councils are working on how to implement this, but that the <br/>\nintention is not to have regular GS go away. They did market research, <br/>\napparently, and found that among older girls that GS was not &quot;cool&quot;, and that&#39;s why <br/>\nthey left the program.<br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore, the new program was designed so that it will not even mention that <br/>\nit&#39;s a GS program. To me it also doesn&#39;t sound that thrilling. I dunno.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s going to get me more info. I&#39;ll pass it along if anyone cares.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15071,"nextTopicId":15220}}
