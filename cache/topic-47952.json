If you&#39;ve never read &quot;Raising Your Spirited Child&quot;, it would be a good read if that&#39;s the case.<br/>\n<br/>\nTransitions also might be hard for him. If I&#39;m remembering correctly, that&#39;s also addressed in that book. Evan, my oldest, HATED when seasons changed, and he was either going to switch from pants to shorts, or shorts to pants. I never forced the switch, but he wanted to be comfortable. I remember him being very resistant to that change.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s also a transition when leaving the house, and since he&#39;s happy once he&#39;s out, and then doesn&#39;t want to leave wherever he is then, that might be the case, difficulty with transitions in general. As Evan got older, I could talk to him about that, remind him that he didn&#39;t like to change what he was doing, but once he did, he usually liked what we were going to do. I&#39;d also give him the option to come home if I could; if we got where we were going and he wanted to come home, we&#39;d leave right away.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a separate vein, I was also reminded of my youngest. When Seth was an infant, I could tell he absolutely did NOT like blanket sleepers - he&#39;d stretch out his little feet, trying to get them free, and he didn&#39;t sleep well at all if I put him in one. He was born in February, and we lived in an old, cold house! But I noticed he slept much better in those infant nightgowns, with his feet free.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs he got older, he wouldn&#39;t wear coats at all. He was about 2 1/2, when he was able to tell me: &quot;I like being cold!&quot; That was a revelation for me!! I cannot *stand* being cold at all, and the thought that someone would *enjoy* that sensation was surprising to me. I did as was suggested here, I always had warmer clothes with us at the ready, but he always preferred t-shirts, even in very cold weather.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t remember how old he was, still fairly young, when we were going to be around family, and it was cold. I said something like, &quot;I&#39;m a little worried that they&#39;ll think I&#39;m a bad mommy, if I don&#39;t have you dress warmly.&quot; He just laughed and laughed, like that was the silliest thing he&#39;d ever heard. It gave me a great perspective. I just told them, &quot;He really likes being cold!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he was 2, one friend was telling me that very young children&#39;s bodies don&#39;t self-regulate as well as adults, that they don&#39;t &quot;feel&quot; cold like adults do, and it could be harmful to him to let him play without a coat. I&#39;d never heard that before, and it worried me! I kept checking in with him while he played at her house, and he never wanted a coat, and his lips didn&#39;t turn blue or anything. He&#39;s ten now, and has survived just fine so far!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy gut feeling for your son is it&#39;s more the transition and sensitivity to textures thing, rather than liking cold, though I couldn&#39;t tell you why I think that!
