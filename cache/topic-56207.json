To answer Sandra&#39;s question, yes I have met socially awkward homeschoolers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I was also naturally shy, however I felt more socially comfortable in K-4th grade in private school and later in private school and public highschool than I did in those 4 years of homeschooling.  This is not a reflection on homeschooling necessarily, this is a reflection on a combination of my natural personality combined with little opportunity for social interaction during those homeschooling years.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn that small town, with few activities available outside of school, and religious parents who may or may not have approved of non-religious friends, it is entirely possible I would have had the same experience had I attended public school for those few years.  After all, public school *in itself* is not a great place for social interaction.  Those opportunities come up after school and in sports and girl scouts etc.  Things I did not do.  When I was younger the opportunities came through the church we went to the ran the private school, but that was no longer an option during those 4 homeschooled years.    <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my other post I also said that I have met socially awkward public schooled kids and that it is a combination of factors.

There are family members he&#39;d rather not see.  I&#39;m ok with that.  They&#39;re really aren&#39;t a pleasure to be with.   We have one friend he actively avoids.  She has had a lot of hardship and in that way that some injured people survive by becoming self obsessed she is so full of herself that it&#39;s hard to talk with her.  And she draws her injuries like a dagger in the course of conversation so that, no matter what the topic, it comes round to her particular suffering.  I understand how she got that way.  It doesn&#39;t make her easier to be around.    <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And we have a family member who is all new agey and LoA-ish and has an agenda every time she talks, especially with young people, she sees herself as a guide.   Dylan avoids her.  He does not like her leading questions.  Of the two she seems more socially awkward, not understanding or caring she&#39;s crossing personal boundaries. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So what is awkward?  If you have nothing in common with a crowd of young people who are using language for shock value and say things they think sound cool and you&#39;re not interested in hearing about the latest kegger and who puked, are you socially awkward?   If you don&#39;t want to answer questions that are none of the questioner&#39;s business, does that make you socially awkward?   If a person is just so full of shit you don&#39;t want to talk to them, are you socially awkward?    I think some people expect to be found fascinating, no matter how obnoxious or offensive they really are,  and if someone doesn&#39;t find them so, that person must be socially awkward.    <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dylan really enjoys talking with intelligent, clever people.  He doesn&#39;t enjoy crowds of people.   He doesn&#39;t enjoy small talk and silliness.   Maybe that qualifies him as socially awkward but he&#39;s ok with it. &lt;g&gt;   If he was older and rich and successful he&#39;d be called &quot;discerning&quot; instead of &quot;&quot;socially awkward. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The people I know personally who are the most socially awkward were public schooled.   Because socialization has been the boogeyman of homeschooling for decades, shy or introverted people who were homeschooled must have been made shy and introverted by the homeschooling.

I think some people expect to be found fascinating, no matter how obnoxious or offensive they really are,  and if someone doesn&#39;t find them so, that person must be socially awkward.    <br/>\n<br/>\nDylan really enjoys talking with intelligent, clever people.  He doesn&#39;t enjoy crowds of people.   He doesn&#39;t enjoy small talk and silliness.   Maybe that qualifies him as socially awkward but he&#39;s ok with it. &lt;g&gt;   If he was older and rich and successful he&#39;d be called &quot;discerning&quot; instead of &quot;&quot;socially awkward. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe people I know personally who are the most socially awkward were public schooled.   Because socialization has been the boogeyman of homeschooling for decades, shy or introverted people who were homeschooled must have been made shy and introverted by the homeschooling.  Shy or introverted people in school were just weirdo&#39;s.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: note from Kirby&#39;s supervisor","postDate":"1279589276","msgId":56234,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdCNTI1QUJDLTgwRDctNEYxMy05MUQ0LUUzRUE4QUM4RkM5MEBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGkyMmtzcSs5YThpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGkyMmtzcSs5YThpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":56229,"nextInTopic":56235,"prevInTime":56233,"nextInTime":56235,"topicId":56207,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I haven&#39;t.*<br/>\n<br/>\nNot one.  I started a homeschool soccer league last spring and had the pleasure of meeting 60 or so kids (plus siblings and families) from all age groups. (we even fielded a U19 team, so I had players from age 4 to 19 :)  While I am in the middle of bible country (no offense anyone!) and most of these kids are not necessarily &#39;unschoolers&#39; (like my family is)(okay - none of them are :) , I found them all a joy to be around.  It was the most amazing group of kids.  We had  (have) coed teams and to see the older kids together without the usual steryotypical &#39;teenager&#39; type behavior was refreshing.  They were fantastic &#39;young adults&#39; who did not seem worried about dating and gossiping, or embarrased at hanging out with their families,  etc ... they just all had a great time being together.  Its a very recreational league (but we play against the various schools) and we had all the teams practice at  the same park with multiple fields, on the same date, etc..... we had one family with 7 kids and they all got to play due to this convienience.  The families could watch ALL their kids practice at the same time, same place, and it was such a great environment. (and a very diverse group) <br/>\nI heard my mom say something about a &#39;nerdy&#39; kid recently, and boy did she get an earful  :)  I just dont think like that, and dont appreciate people who do.  I wonder how many people wouldnt say those &#39;socially awkward&#39; comments if they didnt know in advance that the kids were homeschooled.  I feel most of these comments in general represent the &#39;high school&#39; mentality that unfortunaltely most cant shake upon graduation.  We all know those adults who seem like they are still in attendance socially.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kirby has a new supervisor at work.
