We will often have plan A, plan B, plan C etc and then go from there. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe also use it for uncertain situations like: getting a ride from so and so is plan A, and my being done coming to get him is plan B, and taking the bus is plan C.<br/>\nWe got this from Ross Greene&#39;s Collaborative Problem Solving and use it all the time. <br/>\nWe sometimes have to write it down so that my youngest will remember in the heat of the moment (he has neurological regulation issues) or my middle son will remember the order (he has processing issues) or I will remember that it was an issue. You can draw pictures to remind a child who can&#39;t read. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet me know if you try it and it helps.<br/>\nJae<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":307938888,"authorName":"michmdmama","from":"&quot;michmdmama&quot; &lt;horein@...&gt;","profile":"michmdmama","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Ice Cream at the Park","postDate":"1216161306","msgId":36577,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGc1ajhtcSt0NGVrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PENDNTYwMzg4LUEzOUEtNERGMy05M0ZBLTI4OTFGRTQ4NDc2MUBzYmNnbG9iYWwubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":36575,"nextInTopic":36581,"prevInTime":36576,"nextInTime":36578,"topicId":36575,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I would consider other options.
