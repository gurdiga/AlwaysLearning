One of the pieces had her name and date of birth and death. Then <br/>\nthat poem that goes &quot;One hundred years from now, it will not matter what kind <br/>\nof car I drove, what kind of house I lived in, how much money I had or what <br/>\nmy clothes looked like.  But the world may be a little better, the universe a <br/>\nlittle brighter, because I was important to a child.&quot; and then a personal <br/>\nnote followed:<br/>\n&quot;Karen (My legal name)--Your mother&#39;s mission in life was to make a <br/>\ndifference not just in the lives of her own children, but all children whose <br/>\nlives she was able to touch.  She succeeded in both, and not it is your <br/>\npriilege to carry it on to following generations.  You too will succeed, for <br/>\nyou have a lot of your mother in you.<br/>\nIn loving memory of your mother.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s when I started crying.<br/>\nI thought this was one of the most poignant, sweet gifts I have ever <br/>\nreceived. Apparently me Dad knew someone whose Father died before their first <br/>\nbaby was born. After the baby came along, somebody made a quilt of the <br/>\nGrandfathers shirts for the baby.<br/>\nHe remembered this and decided to take all of my mothers clothes and have <br/>\nspecial quilts made for each of us girls.<br/>\nHe&#39;s such a wonderful Daddy.  I touch each piece of cloth and remember her <br/>\nwearing that outfit. I remember helping her pick out shoes for one of the <br/>\noutfits while we were shopping at Jantzen Beach (Portland) one day....the <br/>\nkids rode the carousel afterwards.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhoo.....I just thought it was a marvelous and touching thing to do, maybe <br/>\nsome of you have clothes of loved ones that have died and you don&#39;t know what <br/>\nto do with them. <br/>\nWhat a wonderful way to remember someone and clean out the closet at the same <br/>\ntime. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s off to the Gulfarium for us today.  We&#39;re going to feed the <br/>\ndolphins..hurray!!<br/>\nHope everyone has a wonderful, beautiful, sweet, unschooling day with those <br/>\nyou love best.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>\ngrowing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>\nmagic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>\nme....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n                                    ----Frances Hodgson Burnett</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13002,"nextTopicId":13006}}
