But here&#39;s a few<br/>\nof interesting things I ran across, how Rural Free Delivery was responsible<br/>\nfor improving roads, missle mail and a still running mule mail delivery and<br/>\nthings you can&#39;t send to other countries. Some odd things showed up in a<br/>\nnumber of country&#39;s lists like prison-made items, shoes and playing cards.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.usps.com/history/history/his1.htm\">http://www.usps.com/history/history/his1.htm</a><br/>\nRural Free Delivery<br/>\n <br/>\nToday it is difficult to envision the isolation that was the lot of farm<br/>\nfamilies in early America. In the days before telephones, radios, or<br/>\ntelevisions were common, the farmer&#39;s main links to the outside world were<br/>\nthe mail and the newspapers that came by mail to the nearest post office.<br/>\nSince the mail had to be picked up, this meant a trip to the post office,<br/>\noften involving a day&#39;s travel, round-trip. The farmer might delay picking<br/>\nup mail for days, weeks, or even months until the trip could be coupled with<br/>\none for supplies, food, or equipment.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Wanamaker of Pennsylvania was the first Postmaster General to advocate<br/>\nrural free delivery (RFD). Although funds were appropriated a month before<br/>\nhe left office in 1893, subsequent Postmasters General dragged their feet on<br/>\ninaugurating the new service so that it was 1896 before the first<br/>\nexperimental rural delivery routes began in West Virginia, with carriers<br/>\nworking out of post offices in Charlestown, Halltown, and Uvilla.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany transportation events in postal history were marked by great<br/>\ndemonstrations: the Pony Express, for example, and scheduled airmail service<br/>\nin 1918. The West Virginia experiment with rural free delivery, however, was<br/>\nlaunched in relative obscurity and in an atmosphere of hostility. Critics of<br/>\nthe plan claimed it was impracticaland too expensive to have a postal<br/>\ncarrier trudge over rutted roads and through forests trying to deliver mail<br/>\nin all kinds of weather.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, the farmers, without exception, were delighted with the new service<br/>\nand the new world open to them. After receiving free delivery for a few<br/>\nmonths, one observed that it would take away part of life to give it up. A<br/>\nMissouri farmer looked back on his life and calculated that, in 15 years, he<br/>\nhad traveled 12,000 miles going to and from his post office to get the mail.<br/>\n<br/>\nA byproduct of rural free delivery was the stimulation it provided to the<br/>\ndevelopment of the great American system of roads and highways. A<br/>\nprerequisite for rural delivery was good roads. After hundreds of petitions<br/>\nfor rural delivery were turned down by the Post Office because of<br/>\nunserviceable and inaccessible roads, responsible local governments began to<br/>\nextend and improve existing highways. Between 1897 and 1908, these local<br/>\ngovernments spent an estimated $72 million on bridges, culverts, and other<br/>\nimprovements. In one county in Indiana, farmers themselves paid over $2,600<br/>\nto grade and gravel a road in order to qualify for RFD.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe impact of RFD as a cultural and social agent for millions of Americans<br/>\nwas even more striking, and, in this respect, rural delivery still is a<br/>\nvital link between industrial and rural America.<br/>\n<br/>\nMissile Mail <br/>\n<br/>\nThroughout its history, the Postal Service enthusiastically has explored<br/>\nfaster, more efficient forms of mail transportation. Technologies now<br/>\ncommonplace -- railroads, automobiles, and airplanes -- were embraced by the<br/>\nPost Office Department at their radical birth, when they were considered<br/>\nnew-fangled, unworkable contraptions by many.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne such technology, however, remains only a footnote in the history of mail<br/>\ndelivery. On June 8, 1959, in a move a postal official heralded as &quot;of<br/>\nhistoric significance to the peoples of the entire world,&quot; the Navy<br/>\nsubmarine U.S.S. Barbero fired a guided missile carrying 3,000 letters at<br/>\nthe Naval Auxiliary Air Station in Mayport, Florida. &quot;Before man reaches the<br/>\nmoon,&quot; the official was quoted as saying, &quot;mail will be delivered within<br/>\nhours from New York to California, to Britain, to India or Australia by<br/>\nguided missiles - missile mail.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHistory proved differently, but this experiment with missile mail<br/>\nexemplifies the pioneering spirit of the Post Office Department when it came<br/>\nto developing faster, better ways of moving the mail.<br/>\n<br/>\nMule Mail - High Tech, Then Low Trek Descent into Grand Canyon, Mule Mail<br/>\n<br/>\n The sign on the only cafe in town reads &quot;No Fries &#39;Til Mail.&quot; Life in the<br/>\ncommunity of Supai, Arizona, literally survives on its mail--and eats more<br/>\nmail than it reads.<br/>\n<br/>\nArguably the most remote mail route in the country, the Supai route is the<br/>\nlast mule train delivery in the United States.

I thought it was one of those LOL type of things.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway...just wanted to share a really fun thing that happened last <br/>\nnight.  My two older girls, Aislinn, 7, and Elysia, 5, have been staying <br/>\nup with me for the last 3 nights until about 12:30.  The first two <br/>\nnights we looked at &quot;reborn&quot; babies online (check them out, they&#39;re <br/>\namazing!).  Last night was different.  We have a library room in our <br/>\nhouse with a built-in bookshelf that&#39;s about 9&#39; high x 13&#39; wide thats <br/>\noverflowing with books.  But off on it&#39;s own is a little antique <br/>\nbookshelf with glass doors.  It too is full of books, but antique books. <br/>\n For the first time last night, Aislinn asked me about those books.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the books belonged to my greatgrandfather.  About 25 are my <br/>\ngreatgrandmother&#39;s diaries. Some belonged to other passed away family <br/>\nmembers.  Some I just bought at yard sales because they were beautiful.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo the girls asked if we could get a few out.  The first one they picked <br/>\nwas a monsterous old bible. As soon as we opened it we made a fabulous <br/>\ndiscovery...a letter to my great grandfather mailed on Oct. 4, 1945 from <br/>\nOntario, Canada...and it&#39;s never been opened.  We were so excited.  The <br/>\ngirls didn&#39;t want to open it.  They have a thing about suspending the <br/>\nmagic and mystery as long as possible.  So I asked them how they would <br/>\nfeel if we let my Oma (Grandmother) open it.  The letter is addressed to <br/>\nher fil.  So now we can&#39;t wait until she comes over today to show her <br/>\nthe letter.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that, we picked a book at random from among the diaries.  The <br/>\nsmall autograph album I pulled out was gifted to my ggm on March 18,1893 <br/>\nas a going-away present from her friends as she was moving from <br/>\nPlymouth, Kansas to Kenmore, NY where she met and married my ggf (to <br/>\nwhom the letter is addressed).  She had traveled to Kansas with her <br/>\nfamily in a wagon train.  The girls and I were moved to tears as we read <br/>\nthe wonderful little good-bye poems that people wrote.  Ex: the first <br/>\none...Dear Mary, Friends must part, Strangers meet, Ties be broken once <br/>\nso sweet.  This world must change and be anew, And you and I must bid <br/>\nadeiu.  Forget-me-not.  From your friend, Lizzie Beiyliff.  Each person <br/>\nhad a different poem and they are all so sweet.  They skipped pages and <br/>\nthen later on others wrote in it too including my gf, her adopted son, <br/>\nwrote on Dec 21., 1921: &quot;To Mother, Remember me when this you see.  The <br/>\n many miles apart we be.  Your loving son, Kenneth.&quot;  He was 10 years <br/>\nold when he wrote that to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this is so long.  It was just a kind of magical night filled with <br/>\nfriendly ghosts and talk of times gone by.  Then we went to sleep <br/>\ntogether on our screened-in porch where we continued to<br/>\ntalk about all sorts of meaningful stuff.  Wow...what a great night.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15743,"nextTopicId":15762}}
