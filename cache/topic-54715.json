Most of them are unschooling, but I have a some friends who range between eclectic and &quot;classical&quot; home learners and I&#39;ve included them, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also got a sidebar on my blog with some of my favourite unschooling blogs listed. These are my current favourites. I do tend to add to and delete from this list in a very unfaithful way... it just depends on my current mood (and who&#39;s keeping up on their blogging).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy own blog is all over the place and is really for my mother (heh) and friends/family, so I&#39;m not sure it qualifies as an &quot;unschooling&quot; blog.

Choose &quot;Blog List&quot; and then add your favourite blogs. You can choose how much info shows up on your sidebar. On my blog, I choose just the blog&#39;s title and the title of the latest post. And I choose to list them according to recently updated instead of alphabetical order. Have fun. :) :)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Rebecca</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] What are your favorite unschooling blogs?","postDate":"1276020919","msgId":54730,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI0MzEyOC42NDY2MS5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MTYubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGh1anZyZCtkYTlzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGh1anZyZCtkYTlzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54715,"nextInTopic":54731,"prevInTime":54729,"nextInTime":54731,"topicId":54715,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***I am having fun looking at the multitude of unschooling blogs out there and would love to hear what you are finding to be your favorities?*** This is","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1777333140\">***I am having fun looking at the multitude of unschooling blogs out there and would love to hear what you are finding to be your favorities?***<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is mine...
