It<br/>\ntalks a lot about Grimm&#39;s fairy tales, which are quite violent in many<br/>\nways.  I believe Bettelheim also talks a bit about how the watered<br/>\ndown Disney fairy tales do our kids a disservice in comparison to<br/>\nGrimm&#39;s tales.  I think Bettelheim&#39;s views would be directly<br/>\napplicable to the question of toy guns. <br/>\n<br/>\nBettelheim also has the view that when we protect our children from<br/>\nthose harsh realities of good and evil, it actually hurts our<br/>\nchildren.  This is because, even when we don&#39;t discuss it with our<br/>\nchildren, they will still *have* those &quot;evil&quot; ideas going through<br/>\ntheir head.  If we deny our children the opportunity to work through<br/>\nthe ideas, they can actually develop some guilt or self-hatred (&quot;Why<br/>\nam I thinking these violent thoughts?&quot;  &quot;What kind of person am I?&quot;).<br/>\n Again, I personally think the gun issue is applicable here, too. <br/>\nEven if we shelter our children from guns by refusing them to enter<br/>\nour house, our children will surely eventually become aware of their<br/>\nexistence.  What will our children be thinking of themselves when they<br/>\nwant to work through the use/purpose of guns within themselves, and<br/>\nwhen we deny them the ability to come to terms with their own feelings<br/>\non the matter?<br/>\n<br/>\nTrish</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: toy guns","postDate":"1221309839","msgId":38253,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdhZ2NpZisyYTlnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdhZTlsZytua2hrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38251,"nextInTopic":38256,"prevInTime":38252,"nextInTime":38254,"topicId":38154,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... way of verbalizing it.

To shield children right up to the age of 18 from<br/>\nexposure to violent descriptions and images would not only be quixotic,<br/>\nbut deforming; it would leave them unequipped to cope with the world as<br/>\nwe know it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis seems to be the fear of gun play.  That kids will become violent if<br/>\nthey play with guns.  So parents try to eliminate anything violent, to<br/>\nshield their children.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone on another list I&#39;m on was asking about nonviolent video games<br/>\nfor their young child.  They were concerned with an online set of kid<br/>\ngames that had things such as hitting crabs with yoyo&#39;s and dropping<br/>\nnuts on squirrels.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seemed to me that it was a little overprotective and extreme.  What<br/>\nwe actually do to crabs to eat them seems so much worse than hitting<br/>\nthem with a yoyo and I&#39;ve had squirrels intentionally hit me with nuts. <br/>\nAt our very basic nature, it&#39;s eat or get eaten.  When a lion downs<br/>\nanother animal, it is pretty violent, it&#39;s nature, we are a part of<br/>\nnature.  Even though we have higher thinking skills, we still have those<br/>\nbasic animal instincts.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuns are an evolutionary weapon, I imagine it used to be sticks and<br/>\nstones, and then more advanced weapons came along as we entered the iron<br/>\nage, and then more advanced and more advanced.  Guns were designed to<br/>\nkill other people, but like swords and knives, they evolved for other<br/>\npurposes too, hunting, survival, protection.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know one bow hunter IRL, I know even more people who practice archery,<br/>\nthat have never been hunting, and have never killed a living being.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: toy guns","postDate":"1221245694","msgId":38210,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdEN0Q2QjAxLUIwQTUtNEVCNi1CNUQ4LTM5NTRGQjVBRTkzNUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdhZTlsZytua2hrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdhZTlsZytua2hrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38209,"nextInTopic":38217,"prevInTime":38209,"nextInTime":38211,"topicId":38154,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

And I worried<br/>\nfor a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I wanted to make it clear that guns are not for play but there<br/>\nare play guns, I arranged a visit out to the NV desert, where my<br/>\nstepdad is a gunsmith. He let Rowan walk around the shop, showed him<br/>\nall kinds of guns, then we went out into the boonies, where stepdad<br/>\nhad set up a demonstration that&#39;s been really good for adults, where<br/>\nyou fill up gallon jugs with water and red food color, and then shoot<br/>\nthose. The red water goes everywhere, and makes it really easy to see<br/>\nthat in real life, things you shoot tend to explode, quite unlike what<br/>\nthey do in movies.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there we are... and Mom realizes she&#39;s out of red coloring, but has<br/>\nblue, and hey, a splash is a splash. And we set up the demo, and give<br/>\nRowan The Serious Talk About Gun Safety (tm), back him up to next to<br/>\nstepdad, who proceeds to demolish the jugs, and blue water goes flying<br/>\neveryplace. It&#39;s totally cool. Rowan has a very thoughtful look on his<br/>\nface, and I ask if he understands that this is what happens when you<br/>\nshoot living things with guns. He smiles and says &quot;but Mama, those<br/>\nwere more like what happens to aliens, cause it was blue!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously the NRA&#39;s Eddie Eagle program would be more successful if it<br/>\nincluded aliens. =P<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I don&#39;t worry about him understanding the gun thing any more.<br/>\nClearly, he gets it. =) =) So I just let him play. And everything is a<br/>\ngun. The only request we make is that they not shoot at living things<br/>\nor at people not playing.

I finally had a light bulb moment ... my <br/>\nreaction to toy guns were not about my kids.  It stems from my own <br/>\nissues.  I&#39;ve learned to take a step back and see what they are doing <br/>\nfor what it is ... simply playing.  So, I&#39;m comfortable with that now, <br/>\nbut I have a new issue.  Most of our schooled friends are highly <br/>\nopposed to guns (one won&#39;t even let her son pretend that his hand is a <br/>\ngun and make shooting sounds).  They tell me their feelings are because <br/>\nof how the school environments are these days.  I try to respect their <br/>\nwishes and tell my kids that we can&#39;t do any pretend shooting when we <br/>\nare with those kids; however, my younger son is not one to be <br/>\ncontrolled (which, yes, I can see as a good thing!).  We enjoy my <br/>\nfriend&#39;s and her son&#39;s company, but would love to have our visits be <br/>\nmore comfortable ... where we can just let our kids play without <br/>\ninterfering and telling them how to play.  Does anyone have any <br/>\nthoughts on the topic, or have you encountered a similar situation?<br/>\nKim</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38425,"nextTopicId":38305}}
