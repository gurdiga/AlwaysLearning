Natural learning is quite <br/>\ndifferent from &quot;school at home,&quot; and can be hard to explain or imagine.   It <br/>\ncomes not from &quot;what to do&quot; stories, but from considerations of how to live.  <br/>\nNot all homeschoolers have models and mentors, but this book can be the next <br/>\nbest thing.  Not only are the Coltens&#39; lives shared, but other homeschooling <br/>\nfamilies have offered glimpses of their own herein as well.  Many questions are <br/>\nanswered.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot only that, she took the time to send me the corrections she saw that <br/>\nneeded to be made.  She not only has a sharp wit, but a sharp eye!<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to publicly thank her.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\nps - if you want to visit the website of the book it is:<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.homeschoolingreflections.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17256,"nextTopicId":16857}}
