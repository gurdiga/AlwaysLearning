I can tell you the story of where that<br/>\n&gt; tool came from, the &quot;make the better choice.&quot; I&#39;ve told it before,<br/>\n&gt; but there are always some new people.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; About 20 years ago (a little more), at Grand Outlandish, a big SCA<br/>\n&gt; campout here on Memorial Day weekend, a friend of ours was going to<br/>\n&gt; be knighted, so he was &quot;on vigil&quot;--our version of a medieval knight&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; vigil in a church, but ours is usually (and was that night) the<br/>\n&gt; knighthood candidate sitting formally in a tent (or a room, but we<br/>\n&gt; were camping) as people come by singly or in small groups to advise<br/>\n&gt; him or to speak with him as they wish. Some bring gifts. I brought<br/>\n&gt; a candle that night. He was in a tent I had made myself, that<br/>\n&gt; night, and his name was Leif.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He said he was worried that his camping equipment wasn&#39;t good enough,<br/>\n&gt; and that as a knight he should set a better example. At that point,<br/>\n&gt; Keith and I had been improving our own camp for eight years or so,<br/>\n&gt; and he used that as an example, and another one of someone who had<br/>\n&gt; been doing it for a while. He asked how he could have a camp like<br/>\n&gt; that, and he seemed to feel it needed to be immediately, or he might<br/>\n&gt; as well not start.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That feeling of being overwhelmed about how to start caused me to<br/>\n&gt; advise him thusly:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As you replace items, make the more medieval choice and incrementally<br/>\n&gt; your camp will get better. If you&#39;re getting a tent and your choices<br/>\n&gt; are nylon or canvas, choose canvas. If your choice is orange or<br/>\n&gt; brown, choose brown. Make the better choice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I went back to my own camp all energized and excited, even though it<br/>\n&gt; was after midnight, and told Gunwaldt and Artan (Keith my husband and<br/>\n&gt; Jeff my friend and camping buddy) about it, and we all were happy<br/>\n&gt; with the breakthrough in the way we could advise people on all KINDS<br/>\n&gt; of things with that. Kirby was a baby then. It helped me be a<br/>\n&gt; better mom.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You don&#39;t have to barrel toward your goal without looking around.<br/>\n&gt; You can get there naturally if when there&#39;s an option you make the<br/>\n&gt; one that takes you nearer to the place or the way you want to be.<br/>\n&gt; And as time went by and I tried that advice out in different contexts<br/>\n&gt; and with different people, I added the idea that before you can make<br/>\n&gt; a choice, you have to have at least two options. Some people talk<br/>\n&gt; the talk like they&#39;re making choices, but they&#39;re not stopping to<br/>\n&gt; think of options, really.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In the first Terminator movie (NOT a favorite of mine), the little<br/>\n&gt; pull-down menu of options he has to consider reminds me of this<br/>\n&gt; idea. And you can learn and add more good options to your menu, and<br/>\n&gt; eliminate those you don&#39;t need or use anymore because you have better<br/>\n&gt; ones.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: new with a few questions","postDate":"1219011569","msgId":37179,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc0ODIwNS42OTQ4OS5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwMi5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":37178,"nextInTopic":37180,"prevInTime":37178,"nextInTime":37180,"topicId":37151,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t know why, but everytime I read stuff you write, I remember funny little stories that I want to share but generally don t.

We were at<br/>\nthe ice skating rink, in the bathroom. They have those hand driers that<br/>\nare very very strong and loud and dry your hands in like 5 seconds. I<br/>\nwas waiting for one of my kids to be done and was just hanging out in<br/>\nthere. There was another mom in there with her daughter, who was about<br/>\n6. She was doing that shaming nasty stuff to her daughter, trying to<br/>\nget her to hurry. So, because I&#39;m bored, stuck in a bathroom, and I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to hear her, every time she started to lay into her<br/>\ndaughter, I triggered the drier. It completely drowns out all sound in<br/>\nthe room, the little girl can&#39;t hear her mother harping at her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did it repeatedly until it was time to leave the bathroom. Did it<br/>\nhelp? Who knows?

Thank you so much for posting this. I am also thinking very much about Sandra&#39;s post on choices. I love that SCA story and way of thinking about making gradual changes. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy youngest son has a genetic neurological dysregulation that fits all the criteria for bipolar disorder (but I hate that term and the labeling) and anxiety. I think the anxiety comes from having his brain swing out of his control but he is also a very sensitive person. I have helped him to regulate from the beginning when he couldn&#39;t regulate blood sugar or temperature. I could do that for him with kangaroo care or attachment parenting. But he still has lots of trouble with regulation. We tried the medication route and lithium helps him, but not enough. All of the other medications are dreadful and cause more problems than they fix. We use Ross Greene&#39;s Collaborative Problem Solving (from his book, The Explosive Child). In trying to decrease his frustration level, we got into unschooling and then radical unschooling. I love the book &quot;Raising our Children, Raising ourselves&quot; by Naomi Aldort and try to follow that philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe had been having episodes where he would lose control and have a meltdown and need us to restrain him so that he wouldn&#39;t hurt himself or others. We went into Seattle Children&#39;s hospital for a couple of days to see what they could offer to help. His brother, father or I (mainly me) were with him the whole time and I shared his little hospital bed with him. They had some good tools that they used to help him to reset and we were supposed to get outpatient help with a therapist. The outpatient therapist was more dysfunctional than my son and all the good ones are booked solid.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo now comes my dilemma: There are some psychotherapies that have been shown to be effective and we have been trying to access one of those. I have been thinking in terms of choice of therapist and finding the right therapist but I am wondering if there are other choices besides that. As an analogy, am I thinking of trying to find the right math curriculum, instead of letting him find his own math? It was easy for us to move to unschooling with academics. We have always respected our kids autonomy and tried to do unconditional parenting so it was a natural step to move into radical unschooling, except for dealing with his disorder. There, I am stuck with still trying to use mainstream treatments. (We have tried every kind of alternative medicine and dietary intervention that are available.)

I<br/>\nwas waiting for one of my kids to be done and was just hanging out in<br/>\nthere.  There was another mom in there with her daughter, who was about<br/>\n6.  She was doing that shaming nasty stuff to her daughter, trying to<br/>\nget her to hurry.  So, because I&#39;m bored, stuck in a bathroom, and I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to hear her, every time she started to lay into her<br/>\ndaughter, I triggered the drier.  It completely drowns out all sound in<br/>\nthe room, the little girl can&#39;t hear her mother harping at her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did it repeatedly until it was time to leave the bathroom.  Did it<br/>\nhelp?  Who knows?  I didn&#39;t have to hear it though, the very loud ear<br/>\npiercing drier was more pleasant than hearing a mom shame her child in<br/>\npublic.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I get frustrated, I take a deep breath and think about how I&#39;d feel<br/>\nif I heard myself in public.

My son Jeffrey is now 12 years old and has always taken a <br/>\nlonger time to transition between things than his sisters needed.  <br/>\nPerhaps your son has some similar traits.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeffrey needs to feel a sense of completion when leaving an <br/>\nactivity.  He would get very upset if he was hurried to drop one <br/>\nthing to go do something else.  Now that I look back on those earlier <br/>\nyears, I see the true trouble was in my thinking, not in his.  <br/>\nJeffrey is still the same way about transitions, but because we all <br/>\nknow how Jeffrey feels, our family has learned how to accommodate his <br/>\nneeds.  An example:  Jeffrey loves playing video games.  If he&#39;s <br/>\nplaying a game and we&#39;re wanting to leave the house, I let him know <br/>\nin advance that we&#39;ll be leaving soon.  I ask him to let me know when <br/>\nhe&#39;s reached a stopping point so the rest of us can be ready to go.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t tell him to find a stopping point though.  He would feel <br/>\npressured and sink into a negative mood.  If I&#39;m in a true hurry, and <br/>\nI try my best to never be in a rush, I don&#39;t take my frustration out <br/>\non the kids because the fault is mine.  If I don&#39;t manage time well, <br/>\nI have to deal with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeffrey is and has always been fearful of new things.  However, his <br/>\ncourage is growing as he gets older.  I&#39;ve been told numerous times <br/>\nthat I&#39;m harming him because I don&#39;t force him to jump into new <br/>\nthings.  I disagree and then change the subject.  I really don&#39;t care <br/>\nto argue that point when I&#39;ve watched my son grow into a more <br/>\ncourageous, trusting person.  We talk about everything in detail.  He <br/>\nlikes to hear an explanation of what to expect and how things might <br/>\ndeviate from that expectation.  And most importantly, he likes to <br/>\nknow exactly who is going to be with him.  He prefers me or his dad <br/>\nwhen he goes to a new place.  We&#39;re his safety net.  I don&#39;t worry <br/>\nabout his adult future.  I don&#39;t like to hear people say that if he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t do it now, he&#39;ll never learn to do it.  I don&#39;t believe that <br/>\nat all.  I trust that he&#39;ll do things when he&#39;s ready to do them.  <br/>\nI&#39;m his shield for the negativity we encounter.

My 6 year old went to <br/>\n&gt; preschool for half a year back when he was 3 because several of his <br/>\n&gt; friends went and he thought it would be fun.  He did like it well <br/>\n&gt; enough, but I got a little annoyed when he came home saying he had <br/>\n&gt; gotten in trouble for coloring a bear blue when it clearing showed <br/>\n&gt; it should be brown. Otherwise they havnt been to school. <br/>\n&gt; For the most part we have been unschooling but periodically I get <br/>\n&gt; caught up in our homeschool groups talk and although I have <br/>\nresisted <br/>\n&gt; ever buying a curriculum I have tried to teach the kids a few <br/>\n&gt; things... But then I notice my 5 year old (B) is reading (when i <br/>\n&gt; havnt taught him) or my 6 year old (J) can count money when he <br/>\n&gt; doesnt know the names of the coins and I realize I need to back off <br/>\n&gt; and I do for a while till I once again loose focus.  People say <br/>\n&gt; things to me, like, how is J (6) going to feel when he is the only <br/>\n&gt; kid in Sunday school that cant read, but they turn around and tell <br/>\n&gt; me how incitefull he is and how he makes such interesting <br/>\ncomments.  <br/>\n&gt; So I guess my question is how do I stay focused on Unschooling and <br/>\n&gt; quit getting off track?<br/>\n&gt; My next question has to do with my 5 year old, B.  B feels very <br/>\n&gt; strongly and has alot of trouble with transitions, change, <br/>\nnewness.  <br/>\n&gt; He needs alot of time to himself to work up to things.  For <br/>\nexample, <br/>\n&gt; B didnt think he could swim and he wanted no help.  I left him <br/>\nalone <br/>\n&gt; with it and all summer when we would go to the pool and rather than <br/>\n&gt; play with the other kids he would go off by himself and repeatedly <br/>\n&gt; jump in the shallow end and basically just worked himself into <br/>\n&gt; swimming.  Last week he jumped off the diving board for the first <br/>\n&gt; time.  Proud and anything.  He didnt want my help but would <br/>\n&gt; sometimes ask me to watch him or occasionally get in with him.

It&#39;s a simple idea yet not easy for me. You didn&#39;t like<br/>\nthat eeny-teeny spello, which I never noticed next to the big wonderful<br/>\nidea. Thanks, lady.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for the kind words!  I can tell you the story of where that  <br/>\ntool came from, the &quot;make the better choice.&quot;  I&#39;ve told it before,  <br/>\nbut there are always some new people.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout 20 years ago (a little more), at Grand Outlandish, a big SCA  <br/>\ncampout here on Memorial Day weekend, a friend of ours was going to  <br/>\nbe knighted, so he was &quot;on vigil&quot;--our version of a medieval knight&#39;s  <br/>\nvigil in a church, but ours is usually (and was that night) the  <br/>\nknighthood candidate sitting formally in a tent (or a room, but we  <br/>\nwere camping) as people come by singly or in small groups to advise  <br/>\nhim or to speak with him as they wish.  Some bring gifts.  I brought  <br/>\na candle that night.    He was in a tent I had made myself, that  <br/>\nnight, and his name was Leif.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said he was worried that his camping equipment wasn&#39;t good enough,  <br/>\nand that as a knight he should set a better example.  At that point,  <br/>\nKeith and I had been improving our own camp for eight years or so,  <br/>\nand he used that as an example, and another one of someone who had  <br/>\nbeen doing it for a while.  He asked how he could have a camp like  <br/>\nthat, and he seemed to feel it needed to be immediately, or he might  <br/>\nas well not start.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat feeling of being overwhelmed about how to start caused me to  <br/>\nadvise him thusly:<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you replace items, make the more medieval choice and incrementally  <br/>\nyour camp will get better.  If you&#39;re getting a tent and your choices  <br/>\nare nylon or canvas, choose canvas.  If your choice is orange or  <br/>\nbrown, choose brown.  Make the better choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went back to my own camp all energized and excited, even though it  <br/>\nwas after midnight, and told Gunwaldt and Artan (Keith my husband and  <br/>\nJeff my friend and camping buddy) about it, and we all were happy  <br/>\nwith the breakthrough in the way we could advise people on all KINDS  <br/>\nof things with that.  Kirby was a baby then.  It helped me be a  <br/>\nbetter mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t have to barrel toward your goal without looking around.   <br/>\nYou can get there naturally if when there&#39;s an option you make the  <br/>\none that takes you nearer to the place or the way you want to be.   <br/>\nAnd as time went by and I tried that advice out in different contexts  <br/>\nand with different people, I added the idea that before you can make  <br/>\na choice, you have to have at least two options.   Some people talk  <br/>\nthe talk like they&#39;re making choices, but they&#39;re not stopping to  <br/>\nthink of options, really.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the first Terminator movie (NOT a favorite of mine), the little  <br/>\npull-down menu of options he has to consider reminds me of this  <br/>\nidea.  And you can learn and add more good options to your menu, and  <br/>\neliminate those you don&#39;t need or use anymore because you have better  <br/>\nones.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] new with a few questions","postDate":"1218952640","msgId":37157,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgwODE2MjI1N3IzM2VjZDA4ZmxjZDc4MjliMWQwNDEzODZiQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFFNzgyNzI2LUU5NzQtNDRBMS1BQkY2LTM4ODIwQjMwQzY2RkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGc4ODBoaSs2Y3MzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgkgPDNhOTNmZmYxMDgwODE2MjAwMHU0ODIyM2Q2MnkxZTlhNDFjMzlmYjZmYzRlQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgkgPDFFNzgyNzI2LUU5NzQtNDRBMS1BQkY2LTM4ODIwQjMwQzY2RkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":37156,"nextInTopic":37158,"prevInTime":37156,"nextInTime":37158,"topicId":37151,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... learn about it.

B feels very <br/>\nstrongly and has alot of trouble with transitions, change, newness.  <br/>\nHe needs alot of time to himself to work up to things.  For example, <br/>\nB didnt think he could swim and he wanted no help.  I left him alone <br/>\nwith it and all summer when we would go to the pool and rather than <br/>\nplay with the other kids he would go off by himself and repeatedly <br/>\njump in the shallow end and basically just worked himself into <br/>\nswimming.  Last week he jumped off the diving board for the first <br/>\ntime.  Proud and anything.  He didnt want my help but would <br/>\nsometimes ask me to watch him or occasionally get in with him.  He <br/>\nis very nervous about new things and very fearful of failure or <br/>\nloosing.  <br/>\nOften when he has trouble with transitions for example I make things <br/>\nworse by getting impatient.  How do I teach him to control his <br/>\nemotions?  Any good book suggestions?<br/>\nThanks</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37316,"nextTopicId":37258}}
