She too wants things \nto be ‘perfect’. We held an event last year that was pretty much organised \nentirely by her. One thing I noticed was that with some of her ideas I thought, \noh, that isn’t going to work, but she was absolutely spot on. So that was \nsomething for me to learn, to not be too controlling myself.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>I’ve seen that my daughter also gets overwhelmed if there are too many \nchoices. So we break it down into chunks. I would pick my moment, quite often it \nwould be whilst driving in the car, and we’d discuss ONE aspect of the party. Or \nat home, we’d look through google images and choose foods, or decorations, or \ncostumes. But only one thing at a time. </div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>You need to send invitations out, because it’s so soon, and people might \nnot be able to come. Can you focus on that with her for now? Decide the date and \nthe start time. That’s all. Have it when her friend can come, that way she gets \nTWO birthdays! Reassure her that if she later decides on a theme, and people \nneed to know, it’s an easy matter to call or email everyone.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Then, maybe the following day, in the right moment, ask if she wants people \nto dress up. People need advance warning of that too. Throw ideas around with \nher, then come back to it the next day. Try and make it fun, suggest some truly \npreposterous ideas, laugh about some of the party themes she would definitely \nNOT want. It feels like a burden to her, to have to make all these decisions, so \nI think if you could lighten things a little that would help. Could you go and \nspend a few hours in a toystore playing and picking out prizes for games?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Just focus on one aspect at a time. One a day. Offer some suggestions – \ngoogle images is great for this, or pinterest. </div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>We’ve organised so many parties and events that I now have a 7 day \ntimetable mapped out – it is definitely possible to organise everything in 7 \ndays.

She wants a party, and to\ninvite her friends, but she can’t decide anything else, nor does she want me to\norganise it for her. Every now and then she will come up with one detail, but\nthen as soon as we try to expand on that, it gets (in her words) ‘too hard’, and\nshe starts getting upset, and saying she doesn’t want a party, or she wants the\ntheme to be ‘being sad’. Then an hour later she gets stressed that we have\nnothing planned, and the party is coming up soon. (We haven’t even sent out\ninvitations yet, because she can’t decide on a day. She wanted it to be on her\nactual birthday, but we’ve since discovered that one of her best friends isn’t\navailable that day.)</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>This seems to be something we go through each&nbsp; year. I can’t remember\na year (since she was old enough to start participating in making her own\ndecisions) when she didn’t have difficulty around her birthday, and in the\nweeks/months leading up to it. I’m sure some of it is developmental, and it will\npass, but I really want her to have an enjoyable time on her birthday, and I\ndon’t know how to help her achieve this.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>I don’t think it’s that she doesn’t want a party, and I don’t believe that\na quieter day would make her happy either. When we’ve tried something like that\nin the past, with just inviting everyone to the park and having a cake, she ends\nup disappointed on the day when people are just playing, and there are no party\ngames. The problem seems to be with making the decisions. She likes to have\ncontrol. If I suggest something, she’ll declare it the last thing she wants, yet\nshe can’t seem to think of anything herself. </div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>She has a similar difficulty around Christmas as well, although that seems\nto be easing, whereas the birthday stresses seem to be increasing.

I\ndon’t think she knows what she wants.
