We benefit so much from the trust we exercise since we started applying unschooling principles. But I only found out about this way to parent after considering homeschooling. Also, my sister in Germany has a son who suffers physically from going to school. School is mandatory there. I&#39;d love a book about how to establish a relationship of respect and trust based on unschooling principles even when your child goes to school. Is there such? Sandra, do you feel there is need and would you write one please?</p>\n\n    </div>\n     \n\n    \n    <div style=\"color:#fff;height:0;\"></div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n\t\n</div></div></div></blockquote></span></blockquote></div></div></div></div></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76921,"nextTopicId":76971}}
