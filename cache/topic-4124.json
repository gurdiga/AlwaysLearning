WHY!?? (Why!?? said the mom who doesn&#39;t make her kids<br/>\ngo<br/>\n to school at all....)&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yeah that was the other thing!  Probably so that the child can still lead<br/>\na<br/>\n&quot;normal&quot; life. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, that is what it is!  I am on an e-mail list of other parents of kids<br/>\nwith cancer, and this is what they talk about.  For a lot of the kids who<br/>\nhave been in school, it&#39;s more of a &quot;be with my friends&quot; kind of thing (the<br/>\nsame thing I hear from potential homeschoolers....the parents are ready to<br/>\npull the kids out but the kids don&#39;t want to leave their friends, or be<br/>\n&quot;weird&quot; or whatever.  I&#39;m the opposite.  Even knowing that my child has an<br/>\n80%+ cure rate, I want to spend as much time with him as possible, because I<br/>\nwant to have no regrets later (also one of the reasons I homeschool....who<br/>\nknows what tomorrow will bring?)<br/>\n<br/>\nJanet, mom to Caroline, 7, and Thomas, 3<br/>\n<br/>\nSponsor me in the Suzuki Rock & Roll Marathon as I raise money for the<br/>\nLeukemia & Lymphoma Society.  I&#39;ll be running in honor of my 3 yr old son,<br/>\nThomas, who was diagnosed with leukemia in Oct. 2000.
