About a dozen years ago, when my family <br/>\nmoved back to the states after living in Okinawa, we were camped out in a two <br/>\nbedroom apartment waiting for base housing.  We then had a choice, the seven <br/>\nof us could move into a three bed-room house after three months, or we could <br/>\nwait about a year for a four bedroom.  We did a family vote and went for the <br/>\nthree - which cut out one move.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe put the toy shelves in the large living room, and the piano fit in our <br/>\nbedroom.  My neighbors couldn&#39;t belive the lay-out, but their kids loved to <br/>\nplay in our space.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I have a bathroom all to myself, the mess I pick up is either mine, or <br/>\nTrevor&#39;s, and life has changed drastically.  Kids grow up and leave home, but <br/>\nmemories of really LIVING in the home are forever!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as reading ages:<br/>\n<br/>\nChris - 4 1/2<br/>\nShawn - 6<br/>\nDevin - 10<br/>\nDonika - 4<br/>\nTrevor - 12<br/>\n<br/>\nThe teeth theory didn&#39;t really work for them.  Of course Shawn might have <br/>\nthrown it off when after reading  Bruce the Moose&#39;s Loose Tooth he tied a <br/>\nstring around his front tooth and to the door, slammed the door, and there <br/>\nwent that front tooth about a year before it had planned to get loose on it&#39;s <br/>\nown!!<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13228,"nextTopicId":13232}}
