My bottom <br/>\nline is for me, it is about me. Your bottom line is your choice, your ethics, <br/>\nyour morality, which is not always going to be the same as anybody else&#39;s, most <br/>\nparticularly your child&#39;s. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course your personal bottom line is only relevant on an unschooling list when <br/>\nit is actually applicable to unschooling. Your personal bottom line &quot;which is if <br/>\nyoure gonna do a thing, if you commit to something, you should follow through.&quot; <br/>\nIs almost antithetical to not only unschooling but much of life. I&#39;ve quit lots <br/>\nand lots of things. I dated at least 15 other guys before I dated and married <br/>\nDavid. If I&#39;d stayed with the first guy I dated, we were a very cute and <br/>\ncommitted couple when we were 4 years old and at Montessori school, I don&#39;t know <br/>\nhow my life would have turned out. It would have been a long distance <br/>\nrelationship for a large bit of it, our break up came when he moved 1000 miles <br/>\naway. I&#39;ve quit a fair number of jobs and now am unemployed. But, heck, I <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t be a model for you, I dropped out of high school. That didn&#39;t really <br/>\nmake getting my university degree any harder. I got in with a GED without any <br/>\ndifficulty. And now, for anyone to know that I&#39;m a high school drop out, I have <br/>\nto tell them. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I quit smoking.

People praised <br/>\nme for that failure to stay focussed on my finishing what I started. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve quit way more things than that, and I bet you have too. My mom treated me <br/>\nonce to a failure to finish something. I was reading a book that I wasn&#39;t <br/>\nenjoying and she took it out of my hands and threw it in the trash. It was <br/>\nsweet. It wasn&#39;t gross trash, just a bedroom wicker basket without anything else <br/>\nin it, if I wanted I could grab it out again. But she was dramatically <br/>\ndemonstrating that I didn&#39;t have to commit to something longer than it was <br/>\nenjoyable, at least to a book. I&#39;ve quit reading a fair number of books since <br/>\nthen. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you do something else if you can&#39;t quit what you are currently doing?

They should be &quot;trying on&quot; lots of ideas and it is <br/>\nfantastic when parents will help them try things out without forcing <br/>\nlong-term commitments.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did the exact opposite of this approach. I always added conditional <br/>\nverbiage to make sure there was no pressure to continue if the child <br/>\nwanted to move on - when a kid would say, &quot;I am going to do xyz,&quot; I <br/>\nwould say, &quot;Do you want to try it out and see how it goes for a while?&quot; <br/>\nEven when they were little, I was careful about getting into something <br/>\nthat involved too much commitment before we knew they were going to <br/>\nreally want to stick it out. When my daughter wanted to try gymnastics, <br/>\nI found her a place she could sign up for only 3 weeks at a time. She <br/>\nlasted through a couple of sessions and then was ready to move on to <br/>\nsomething else. It was totally up to her - no big loss, no pressure one <br/>\nway or the other from me. When my daughter signed up for karate, it was <br/>\nat a place with no contract and free couple of weeks to get started. She <br/>\nloved it. She&#39;s still there, 7 years later, at 20 years old, as an <br/>\ninstructor. Letting her quit gymnastics didn&#39;t make her unable to commit <br/>\nlong-term to karate.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelping kids decide to continue or to stop for a while let&#39;s them feel <br/>\nfree to try out new things without fear of being stuck and without shame <br/>\nor embarrassment at not predicting well whether they would like it or <br/>\nnot. They can say things like, &quot;I tried gymnastics for a while - it was <br/>\nfun.&quot; They don&#39;t ever have to say or think, &quot;I am a quitter because I <br/>\ndidnt stick with it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of my kids are focused and committed to a variety of things - one is <br/>\nin grad school, one a senior in college with two majors and a minor, one <br/>\ngetting an ASL interpreting certificate. All of these things took a <br/>\ngreat deal of persistence and, as Sandra called it, endurance. They did <br/>\nNOT learn to persist and endure to achieve their goals by us making them <br/>\nfollow through on things when they were younger.

We bought a piano for Dylan when he was so little no music teacher would take him.   Our house was very small and we had to put half our sectional sofa in the back of my husbands truck to make room for the piano.   We finally found a high school student who&#39;d give him lessons.   She was great, really sweet, didn&#39;t require him to play things he didn&#39;t like, never made playing the piano a drudgery.   He took lessons for a year or so and then she went away to college.   He didn&#39;t want another piano teacher.   Sometimes he played and sometimes he didn&#39;t.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThree years ago he decided he wanted an organ.  We finally found one he liked and that we could afford.  We borrowed a van and drove a hundred and forty miles (both ways!)  to pick it up - wrangled half the neighborhood to move it into the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe plays the organ and piano every day, hours and hours.  Sometimes he plays all night.   I don&#39;t know if he&#39;ll ever earn his living playing music but I do know that he loves it and even if he stops loving it tomorrow he&#39;s had so much pleasure from this old piano and organ.   (Now *organs*, as in two,  AND synthesizers&lt;g&gt;)   For me to have denied him an organ because he was not constantly dedicated to the piano would have meant him missing out on one of the great pleasures of his life.   What a terrible thing.   I can&#39;t be sure, but knowing his personality, I don&#39;t believe he&#39;d have gotten much joy (or any) from lessons as he has from playing what and when and how he liked.  He reads music very competently.  He plays well.    <br/>\n<br/>\n*** When my eldest decided<br/>\nto attend public school, it was wirh the understandingn that she would<br/>\nabide by the rules & expectations of the school -- that she would<br/>\nstudy, complete assignmemts on time, and submit to the standards of<br/>\nthe school.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI sometimes reminded Dylan he could go to school for one day if he wanted to try it.  An hour.    He never felt like it but if he had and it turned out to be a wrong fit for him, he could have come home in a moment.      <br/>\n<br/>\n***I am not &quot;lenient.&quot; ***<br/>\n<br/>\nOh I am!

Sometimes beating one thing into another is the big attraction of metal work - Ray worked a lot with copper before he had his own forge at home because he loves the process so much. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a lot that can be made &quot;sweating&quot; copper together using plumbing tools, though, and that can bring in some of the fun of working hot - and the materials aren&#39;t costly and are easy to find. You just need a simple propane torch, nothing fancy, and if you aren&#39;t actually running water through it your joints don&#39;t have to be all that perfect.<br/>\n<br/>\nSilver takes more specialized tools to work hot (oxy-acetylene torch, I think... some two-gas torch, anyway), and its more of a jewelry-making thing, but it could be worth seeing if MD&#39;s interested in visiting a silver smith. Ray took a class with a local silver and glass smith as a work-exchange before he had his forge. It was a way to get to work with really dangerous levels of heat - which is another part of the appeal of blacksmithing. For that matter, if there&#39;s anyone in the area who works with glass that could be fun, too, if extremes of heat are part of the appeal. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":286713246,"authorName":"Melissa Dietrick","from":"Melissa Dietrick &lt;melissa.dietrick@...&gt;","profile":"melidi7","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Blacksmith","postDate":"1308690106","msgId":61695,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBTkxrVGlrdGU3V29ZbzN4SlpGc3dEellzWUYyN25WTllBQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFDMDg5NDkzLUE1QUQtNDY3My04Q0ZDLTYyQ0RCNDA4OEFBNUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGl0cXNsMStsdXByQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8MUMwODk0OTMtQTVBRC00NjczLThDRkMtNjJDREI0MDg4QUE1QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61694,"nextInTopic":61696,"prevInTime":61694,"nextInTime":61696,"topicId":61672,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-The trouble with real blacksmithing, though, is that it takes brute strength.

Ask who their farrier is - that&#39;s an easy way to get to watch some basic smithing. Beyond that, look for local SCA groups, but also university extension organizations. Both Ray and my dad found blacksmithing classes via extension groups (one in TN, one in the Chicago area). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe trouble with real blacksmithing, though, is that it takes brute strength. Theres a reason you see more little curlicue do-dads than anything else made by smiths - even those take a Lot of work to beat into shape, and those are the starter projects. So for a little guy looking to play with hot metal, I&#39;d suggest some other directions like copper and silver. They&#39;re muuuuuch easier in terms of sheer physical power, but use essentially the same concepts. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":472480490,"authorName":"sheeboo2","from":"&quot;sheeboo2&quot; &lt;brmino@...&gt;","profile":"sheeboo2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Blacksmith","postDate":"1308683372","msgId":61687,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGl0cXE5YytqcmNwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGl0cXEydSs3a3BwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61686,"nextInTopic":61688,"prevInTime":61686,"nextInTime":61688,"topicId":61672,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"A Google video search for Historical reenactment blacksmithing  found these: http://tinyurl.com/3knza9e B","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1885716558\">A Google video search for &quot;Historical reenactment blacksmithing&quot;  found these:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/3knza9e\">http://tinyurl.com/3knza9e</a><br/>\n<br/>\nB</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":472480490,"authorName":"sheeboo2","from":"&quot;sheeboo2&quot; &lt;brmino@...&gt;","profile":"sheeboo2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Blacksmith","postDate":"1308683166","msgId":61686,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGl0cXEydSs3a3BwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDg2ODU4MS43NzM5NS5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNS5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":61685,"nextInTopic":61687,"prevInTime":61685,"nextInTime":61687,"topicId":61672,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Noor was/is really interested in this too and I was able to find a few people/places that work with kids, but none as young as her.

For the next three years until my daughter moved to a place of her own, it was fascinating to watch them together when she was studying or writing an assignment for her college degrees (Arts and Law) while her brother was equally engrossed in playing videogames. She needed to get up early on weekdays to drive to college, he could stay up all night if he wanted to and sleep late. There were other ways in which their daily lives were often a case of one seemingly always working and the other seemingly always on vacation. It was all perfectly congenial however, and that was because my daughter was doing what she wanted to do and my son was doing what he wanted to do and my wife and I were getting what we wanted, which was for our children to be happy. Eight years on, my daughter is currently studying for her Master of Laws and her brother is still spending most of his time playing videogames and he still stays up all night and sleeps late if he wants to. Emotional conflict has been absent from these circumstances for my wife and I because we&#39;re focussed on the *same outcome* for both of our children. They&#39;re simply travelling by very different routes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen happiness is the purpose - not academic achievement, not being an unschooler - and I act in support of that purpose, surprising and fascinating things happen that I could never predict and life paths reveal themselves. It seems to me that it&#39;s common amongst parents to say that what they want *most* for their children is for them to be happy, but my own experience suggests to me that this can&#39;t be merely a hope or a wish or subservient to societal expectations and personal limitations. It must be the primary objective.<br/>\n<br/>\nBob</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":420343672,"authorName":"HSMomma2Bre","from":"&quot;HSMomma2Bre&quot; &lt;homeschooling@...&gt;","profile":"hsmomma2bre","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Feeling Two-Faced about my children&#39;s education","postDate":"1308657654","msgId":61682,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwN2QwMWNjMzAwYSRkZmNlNTdiMCQ5ZjZiMDcxMCRAa2V5YWRtaW5pc3RyYXRpb24uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEQyMTBGMDVFLTJGNjgtNDBENi1BRjk2LTYzNzY0NjE2M0FCNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwMjEwMWNjMmZiNiRiNWJlNDI0MCQyMTNhYzZjMCRAa2V5YWRtaW5pc3RyYXRpb24uY29tPiA8RDIxMEYwNUUtMkY2OC00MEQ2LUFGOTYtNjM3NjQ2MTYzQUI2QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61679,"nextInTopic":61684,"prevInTime":61681,"nextInTime":61683,"topicId":61672,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- Without knowing your family at all, based on what you chose to share with us in one e-mail, it looks to me also like you think your older daughter has","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-538300318\">-=- Without knowing your family at all, based on what you chose to share<br/>\nwith us in one e-mail, it looks to me also like you think your older<br/>\ndaughter &quot;has potential&quot; and you&#39;re afraid of the risk of giving her<br/>\nchoices, but your second daughter is considered a loss, so no problem.

I&#39;ll apologize ahead of time because<br/>\nI know I tend to be long-winded.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nProblem: I&#39;m currently struggling lately with the fact that I&#39;m feeling<br/>\ntwo-faced about my children&#39;s education - two kids - two complete different<br/>\nadventure!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI have two daughters. My 12 yo is homeschooled due to the fact she has ADHD,<br/>\nan anxiety disorder and a language based learning disability. And when I say<br/>\nhomeschooled, well, we generally unschool. We support and encourage anything<br/>\nshe&#39;s passionate about which leads to an enriching environment she learns<br/>\nfrom. No curriculum, no set tables for learning - just plain ol&#39; fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there&#39;s my 16yo. She is currently in grade 10 in the public school<br/>\nsystem which she enjoys. She created and organized her entire 4yr highschool<br/>\nstudy program ahead of time. She&#39;s not entirely sure what she&#39;ll study next<br/>\nbut has a strong interest in forensic science. She is extremely focused<br/>\nabout her future. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever!!! She is always late with her assignments, waits until the last<br/>\nminute to study and gets easily distracted with computer games, friends and<br/>\nboyfriend. Generally, I don&#39;t have a problem with this until I see her<br/>\ngrades. Unfortunately, although she&#39;s a brilliant child, her grades reflect<br/>\nher lack of focus and organization in her studies. I&#39;ve tried everything to<br/>\nhelp her out - but this is just who she is - last minute girl! She does the<br/>\nsame with showers, laundry, eating, etc... <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m struggling with the fact that I&#39;m so leniant and relaxed with one<br/>\nchild&#39;s education - honestly feeling like she&#39;ll learn what she needs to<br/>\nlearn when she needs to learn it while being so strict (and I&#39;ll go as far<br/>\nas saying sometimes mean) with the other child. Hubby has suggested we<br/>\nremove computer access for a while, especially next fall. At first I thought<br/>\nit was a good idea to allow her to develop `good study habits` but then it<br/>\nhit me - who am I to say what `good study habits are for her` and why then<br/>\nwould I allow the other child to have free range of the computer?? <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAs parents, we are not strict, we allow our children to have a say in<br/>\neverything, we allow them to make their own choices. We are &#39;unschoolers&#39; at<br/>\nheart and our lifestyle reflect this EXCEPT when it comes to our oldest&#39;s<br/>\neducation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis kept me awake for a bit last night and I concluded that maybe I&#39;m just<br/>\ntrying to protect my kids from failure. While my youngest is a very hands on<br/>\nkind of person, I allow her to explore and learn in that manner and she is<br/>\nnot experiencing detremental failure after failure in the school system like<br/>\nbefore. Meanwhile, my oldest is at the other side of the spectrum and I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to see her fail in her classes. <br/>\n<br/>\nYet, I&#39;m still struggling with this inside because she is at an age where<br/>\nshe can choose not to go to school and then get a job. if she told me today<br/>\nthat she would not be returning to school in the fall, I might be ok with<br/>\nthat while at the same time be disappointed she didn`t get her high school<br/>\ndiploma. Two-faced??? I hate this! I have no expectations that my youngest<br/>\nwill attempt to get one. If she does - AWESOME! If she doesn`t - no big<br/>\ndeal!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nLet me say that I know I&#39;m the oddball in my family and within my circle of<br/>\nfriends. When I tried to explain this to them, I got all sorts of<br/>\n(unwelcomed) feedback that simply didn&#39;t fit what I need to hear because<br/>\nthey are all coming from the `conventional` thinking of schooling. The worse<br/>\nis when I hear someone say that I MUST expect my daughter to have her<br/>\nhighschool diploma. Excuse me, I don&#39;t have one, yet I do have two college<br/>\ndiplomas. Does that make me unworthy? Unaccepted in society? I followed my<br/>\npassion once I figured out what it was - which was not at 18! I`m glad I<br/>\ndidn`t go to college then because I would have wasted a lot of money. My<br/>\nyoungest is passionate about working at a ranch and maybe owning one some<br/>\nday. Please tell me how forcing her to acquire a highschool diploma will<br/>\nbenefit this dream of hers!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo why in the world am I not reacting the same way with my oldest`s life??<br/>\nWhy am I placing more importance on a conventional education when my honest<br/>\nopinion is the complete opposite? Family expectations? Oldest child with<br/>\nwhom I make most of my mistakes with? Knowing forensic science is going to<br/>\nrequire more focus? This is driving me completely nuts. I know she has an<br/>\nexam tomorrow. Do I think she&#39;s studied her best for it. No! Does it bother<br/>\nme? Not really. but when her grades will come in, I&#39;ll be devastated. I&#39;ll<br/>\nfeel like she didn&#39;t put her all into it. I&#39;ll feel like she could have done<br/>\nbetter. and I&#39;m recognizing here that I&#39;m focusing on how I&#39;m feeling and<br/>\nnot her. I don&#39;t think she really cares what the grades are, as long as she<br/>\npasses the courses.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease advise me on how to get out of this stinkin&#39; thinking!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nChantal<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":61753,"nextTopicId":61770}}
