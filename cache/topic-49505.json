From being taken away from Mother, to having to meet strangers who ask them questions, to not knowing whether they can ask to go to the bathroom--or not even knowing where the bathroom is, to having to put up with really talkative kids asking questions, to having to eat at set times...all these things impacted my 6-year old in profound ways that worked towards pushing her away from her own true identity.

There have been some challenges, too, which <br/>\nhas led to lots of really interesting discussion. Understanding why <br/>\npeople act in ways that can be so unpleasant has been hard. Getting out <br/>\nthere and seeing that he is competent and even exceptionally talented in <br/>\nsome things, has been a huge part of it, though, and in general he has a <br/>\npositive and excited outlook on the future, and mostly positive <br/>\nexperiences with people.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had discussion with some other homeschooling moms the other day- who <br/>\nare either unschooling or seriously trying it on. My statement was that <br/>\nuschooled teens often APPEAR to be exceptional to people in the &quot;real&quot; <br/>\nworld. My proof of that is my own children, and the kids I meet, and <br/>\nstories I hear. Another mom said she gave up on the idea that her kids <br/>\nwould BE exceptional just because they were unschooled. I understand her <br/>\npoint that we should not expect them to excel in real world ways, <br/>\nneccesarily, though they might. And that there is no way to be <br/>\nexceptional in any absolute way, it really is about how others perceive <br/>\nyou. And I am perfectly willing to admit that I see my kids and other <br/>\nunschooled kids as talented and amazing partly because of how I am <br/>\nlooking at them, and partly because they just ARE. And when kids feel <br/>\nyou percieving them from this point of view- they usually respond well. <br/>\nI see this in the difference between how my kids respond to me, and his <br/>\ndad. His dad is learning, but still at times can be very judgemental, <br/>\nand he gets a very bad reponse from the kids when looking at them that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ways in which kids can be exceptional and amazing can be infinite. <br/>\nExceptional in their skill or talent at what they love to do, <br/>\nexceptional in their ability to understand themselves, to relate to <br/>\nothers, to just enjoy their lives, exceptionally  lovely to be around.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son was trying out a new soccer team - he was one of the less skilled <br/>\nplayers. Many of parents of the kids on that team were very convinced <br/>\nthat their kids are exceptional. It seemed like a pretty good thing for <br/>\nmany of the kids- though some of the parents did seem pretty pushy, and <br/>\nvery negative when their kids made mistakes. Though not all - some of <br/>\nthem were very loving and obviously willing to go to great lengths to <br/>\nsupport their kids in athletics, at least.  And the way that these <br/>\nparents see their kids has gone a really long way to allowing them to <br/>\nsee them selves as capable, and their lives as full of possibility. Kids <br/>\nlike the kids on the soccer team, who are encouraged in their athletic <br/>\nand academic ability, are given that positive view of themselves as <br/>\ndefault, because it is what the larger society values, and parental <br/>\nsupport helps even more. Unschooling parents can give their kids that <br/>\npositive view of themselves no matter what their strengths and interests <br/>\nare. That makes a huge difference to a kid. For an unschooling kid, who <br/>\nhasn&#39;t gone out into the real world as much, it is even bigger, because <br/>\ntheir parents are such a large part of their world. If a kid whose <br/>\nparents are supportive is in a school environment, and their strengths <br/>\nare not those typically valued in that environment, the parents support <br/>\ndoes help, but there is still a lot of negative that kid is getting <br/>\nevery day.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers have time to get really good at something, in a relaxed way, <br/>\nwhen they want to. Often kids who are excelling in school, athletics, or <br/>\nclassical music, for example, have really incredibly packed schedules. <br/>\nThese kids can get really good at things, too, but I doubt they have the <br/>\ntime to proceed as thoughtfully as an unschooled kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some thoughts- but something about unschooling CAN be so powerful - <br/>\nand it has such excellent &quot;results&quot;, that can be perceived by just about <br/>\nanyone. It depends on how it is done. I certainly know families who are <br/>\nunschooling in some way, but are very negative towards their kids, <br/>\ndispointed and adversarial. That doesn&#39;t have such good results.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in the end, I do it for the every day result of a good relationship. <br/>\nIt is really nice that it also can work in so well in a real world <br/>\ncontext. And important, for more people wanting to try it and more happy <br/>\nkids.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather (in NY)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: &quot;Unschooling Land&quot;","postDate":"1263252581","msgId":49521,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBMUU0MEI1LURDMjItNEMzRi1CMjYxLTc5ODU4Q0QwMDQ2M0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEVCNzE2ODhELUU1QTQtNDY0MC1CNzY4LTJGRUU1MzEwRjM2OUBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGhpZm9oOCtjbTQxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8RUI3MTY4OEQtRTVBNC00NjQwLUI3NjgtMkZFRTUzMTBGMzY5QGNvbWNhc3QubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":49520,"nextInTopic":49526,"prevInTime":49520,"nextInTime":49522,"topicId":49505,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I m new here and I was wondering about the symposium.

At the symposium, Sandra said that Rosie had been at a <br/>\nconference and had said that Sandra and I were the only real unschooling <br/>\nparents there. Something like that.  Rosie says she&#39;s a little <br/>\nembarrassed that she&#39;d said that, but that I should mention that it was <br/>\nhyperbole and she was making a point. (Which I&#39;ll get to below.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been to a zillion conferences, but I know which one that was --- <br/>\nit was one where a lot of local people who were not actually practicing <br/>\nunschoolers had come and we also had, for some reason, a lot of contact <br/>\nwith those particular parents (who had young children, by the way). <br/>\nThere was quite a bit of telling children what to eat and what to do and <br/>\nwhen to sleep and there was open talk, among the parents, about how they <br/>\nwould never allow their children to watch television or eat sugar, etc. <br/>\nOne of the parents sat at dinner and argued with us quite vociferously <br/>\nabout the need for regular bedtimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - as we were driving home, she said she wanted to clarify that <br/>\nshe didn&#39;t mean that she was going around judging whether someone is or <br/>\nisn&#39;t a good unschooling parent or not, but that HER idea of what <br/>\nunschooling is was not what these other parents seemed to think it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the point - these kids don&#39;t have the baggage that interferes <br/>\nwith clarity of vision in seeing all, and I mean ALL, the logical ways <br/>\nthat unschooling principles apply. To them, it seems just completely <br/>\ninexplicable that someone would understand that forcing reading is a bad <br/>\nidea and not understand that trying to enforce arbitrary bedtimes or <br/>\ncontrolling what a child eats are, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":251210887,"authorName":"Shira Rocklin","from":"Shira Rocklin &lt;shirarocklin@...&gt;","profile":"shirarocklin","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: &quot;Unschooling Land&quot;","postDate":"1263216277","msgId":49510,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRCNEIyNjk1LjgwNjAyMDBAeWFob28uY2E+"},"prevInTopic":49508,"nextInTopic":49512,"prevInTime":49509,"nextInTime":49511,"topicId":49505,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"the Sorooshian girls standards of unschooling families can you elaborate on this?

Yesterday afternoon&#39;s discussion was pretty neat, and anyone present could not argue with the fact that these amazing, inspiring, beautiful, and real unschooled kids are indeed living their reality day to day. Really and for reals. It was really cool to hear the Sorooshians talk about their lives, and to hear the Dodds talk about their lives and Ms. Fetteroll talk about her life, and to know that kids that have lives without school become real people who do real things every day.  For some reason I find it incomprehensible that there are folks out there that want to argue that concept.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I&#39;d had a bit more time to really get into meaningful discussions with your kids, Pam&#39;s kids, Joyce&#39;s kid, plus all their parents, and everyone else. Time constraints and being a commuter rather than staying on-site contributed to that. But I&#39;m thankful for the exchanges I was able to attend.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was beyond intrigued by the Sorooshian girls&#39; standards of unschooling families, and I&#39;m certain that we don&#39;t measure up at the moment. The parenting path I&#39;ve taken has had so many  twists, turns, hills, and detours. I started out open-minded, patient, and loving, but clouded with the baggage of my own conventional childhood upbringing. I do know, however, where we strive to be. I&#39;m certain that due to hard work, diligence, patience, love, and the ability to maintain an open mind my family will one day achieve the standard these girls speak of. For my girls&#39; sake I work towards that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor us, the Unschooling part comes easy.  I have no qualms about cleaning up messes, tv, video games, play all day, etc. That&#39;s easy. For us, the challenges are mostly that Mom is the boat-floater, and therefore out of the home for about 28 hours per week. Thankfully we have both sets of grandparents close by, and they are all supportive. Even though the grandparents have different methods for dealing with day-to-day life, I&#39;m certain their input is valuable. This adventure is just that, and having just met all these remarkable kids, teens,  young adults, and their parents at the conference I am newly rejuvenated and inspired.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for putting this on, Sandra, and thanks to all the presenters.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"&quot;Unschooling Land&quot;","postDate":"1263168452","msgId":49505,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERGMkEzNTIxLUNBRkMtNDQzQS1CRkM3LUI2NzEwQjUzQjg1N0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":49508,"prevInTime":49504,"nextInTime":49506,"topicId":49505,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The symposium is over, but I m still in Santa Fe to recover some, and to take Joyce, Carl and Kathryn to the airport tomorrow.
