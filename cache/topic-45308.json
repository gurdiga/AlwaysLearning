He attended school from pre-K to 1st grade and struggled each day.  He was abused while in school- ranging from being locked in a closet (YEP that is right!) to being stuck in a room all day one on one/ day after day with a para (NOT a teacher) sitting at a desk facing the wall doing worksheets all day everyday (sometimes not even being excused for recess).  There were other incidents too (like not being able to eat his lunch), but those are the two that come to mind right now.  Both times my son started acting out- crying in the morning, getting in trouble at school, cutting his clothes up, running from teachers at recess when it was time to go in, etc... I would surprise drop by and that is when I would find their mistreatings of my son.  I thank God EVERYDAY for making it possible for me to bring my son home.  Especially since hearing about a teacher forceably sitting on an ADHD child for 15 or so minutes who was misbehaving and killing him (even after he told her he could not breathe).  HORRIBLE!!! My son struggled with academics and psychological problems, the school was oblivious on how to handle him.  He was almost 7 when I pulled him out of school- he is almost 10 now and is excelling in all academics.  He refused to read in school and reads VERY well now.  He hated to write and now I catch him all the time writing.  His behavior has improved SOOOO much that he has not needed medication since being out of school (we have been using Natural methods).  Unschooling has been a true answer to our prayers.  I had to test my son recently for state requirements and he blew the test out of the water- scoring in most instances well above average (like in the 90&#39;s out of 100).  It killed me when he was in school and was being misunderstood for a bad boy.  I received calls EVERYDAY (Literally at least if not more).  My son is the sweetest little man you could ever ask for- he is a true delight to have as a son.  My son is VERY bright- he is a very logical and can see things a different way than most people (which always makes things better).  It is like he can look at objects more in depth than the average person.  It is hard to explain but I am SOOOOO proud of him.<br/>\nAgain- I thank God for leading me to homeschooling - now going on 3 years and counting : ) <br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nJennifer Hyatt<br/>\nBachelor of Science in Psychology and Education<br/>\nMother of four all homeschooled : ) (ages 5, 7, 9, and 11).<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mimzy4@...\">Mimzy4@...</a> <br/>\nwww.blessedfamilyofflowers.wordpress.com <br/>\n&quot;Opinion Without Knowledge is Blind&quot; Socrates<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaipelesmom@...\">kaipelesmom@...</a><br/>\nDate: Thu, 21 May 2009 13:47:08 -0700<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Making a decision to home school again<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n      Hi we also have a 6.5 year old son who was diagnosed with mild aspergers while he was in school. This past year we dropped all services and started our journey with unschooling. I completely let the writing thing go and he now writes notes to people and signs on his doors haha! Also I wanted to add that socially things can be challenging but there is also a lot of flexibility in unschooling to really look at his needs and make decisions based on that. It has cut down a lot of his stress and anxiety. I really feel upset with the movement to treat those on the spectrum as people that need to be trained and many times extremely unkindly.

My best advice is the path I took with Trevor - Just let it go. Forget about writing. Assume he will never write. Then one day when he starts typing cheat codes into his favorite video game or posts a keep out sign on his door, just be pleasantly suprised.

You are absolutely right.  I am still looking at life as a struggle.  I have had to struggle to stay alive and sane since I was very little, and I still do it when it is no longer necessary to today.  It has been a struggle to raise my little boy though.  When he was first handed to me, I knew that something was wrong with his health wise.  It was a struggle to get him diagnosed correctly, it was a struggle to keep him alive through that, and it was a struggle to get his autism diagnosed correctly.  The school system was the greatest struggle of all.  I never knew that I could admire the sheer will and bravery of a small child until I had him.  He has been so strong and still has that child like wonder for life that we are all born with. I just don&#39;t want school to take away that spirit, and it seems to be between the bullying and him telling me that he feels stupid because no one is taking the time to explain a worksheet to him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the boring part, the husband and I are definite introverts.  I am very quiet until I get to know someone. We read constantly.  When I am interested in a topic, I will use as many resources possible to find more information. That is something I want to give my children.  I also want them to think for themselves, and approach any problem with as much information as possible and the ability to think about it in a new and different way. <br/>\n<br/>\n I would have to give myself the label of anxiety over depression.  Growing up, I was constantly trying to figure out what was going to happen next, or who was going to do what next.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThomas&#39; strongest interests are in science especially studying the solar system and experiments.  Experiments are his passion.  He loves to make up his own.  He asks many questions from why do cats do that, to how did tornadoes form.  He loves to be read to, and is starting to develop and very fragile confidence in reading out loud to me.  I don&#39;t correct him, unless he asks me to.  I don&#39;t want to ruin that confidence.  He would spend the day building with his Lego&#39;s and has made some very complicated designs following visual directions.  He loves to make up his own board games. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe science part is easy.  He really does not enjoy writing.

Have  you gotten <br/>\nprofessional help with that? You might try taking St John&#39;s Wort a <br/>\ncouple of times a day, for a while. It has been shown to be a bit <br/>\neffective with mild to moderate depression. I&#39;ve used it a couple of <br/>\ntimes when I went through a period when life felt like a struggle to me <br/>\n- it isn&#39;t going to make you all of a sudden feel perky,  but combined <br/>\nwith focusing on the blessings in my life, the great moments, the love <br/>\nof my family and friends, etc., I do think it helped quite a bit. <br/>\nAnother thing that helped me at those times was to make a decision that <br/>\nI wasn&#39;t going to think about the &quot;big picture&quot; for the next 6 months or <br/>\nso -- but just concentrate on my immediate surroundings, my family&#39;s <br/>\ndaily (moment-to-moment) lives. I was sort of fragile and very tense - <br/>\nseemed I could &quot;break&quot; easily - so I nurtured myself by protecting <br/>\nmyself from being overwhelmed by worrying about or even thinking about <br/>\nthings I really couldn&#39;t control (events in other parts of the world, <br/>\nthe future, etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most important thing that you might get from my own experience - I <br/>\nwas very very clear and determined in my own mind that I was not going <br/>\nto let MY depression make my children&#39;s lives less good - and I think it <br/>\nwas that which really helped me the most. I kept on, hour-by-hour, <br/>\nday-after-day, looking for ways to enhance my children&#39;s lives. Over <br/>\ntime, I realized that my life was good and enriched and happy, too. <br/>\nRight now - I LOVE my life. My kids are young adults and they love me <br/>\nand enjoy being with me. Last night I was going to drive about an hour <br/>\nand a half to go pick up Roxana, and as I was leaving the house, Rosie <br/>\nand her boyfriend, Daniel, wanted to ride along - for no reason, just to <br/>\nhang out. So they did and it was nice and after we got Roxana I took <br/>\nthem to a sort of odd little restaurant to get some food to take home <br/>\nwith us (Cha for Tea -- everything is made with green tea) at 11:30 pm. <br/>\nSo - I&#39;m still in the mindset of thinking of ways to enhance their lives <br/>\n- I purposely went to that restaurant because it is unusual and <br/>\ninteresting (and good). I even thought that the clientele were <br/>\ninteresting - it is across the street from Cal State University Long <br/>\nBeach and it is finals time and it has free wi-fi - so it was packed <br/>\nwith students on their laptops all studying and talking and <br/>\neating/drinking. Again - a little interesting. We could have gone to the <br/>\nsame old places we often go or somewhere safer and more mundane like <br/>\nDenny&#39;s - but it occurred to me to swing by this place because I thought <br/>\nit would be something a little different.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Making a decision to home school again","postDate":"1242825663","msgId":45325,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDNjgxN0I5LTc5RUUtNDczNC05NTQ4LTAxRDIxRTQ3MzlDQUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGd2MHJsNytmODVqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGd2MHJsNytmODVqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":45323,"nextInTopic":45328,"prevInTime":45324,"nextInTime":45326,"topicId":45308,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- I need to start pushing my own boundaries and comfort zones.-=- Pushing boundaries sounds like hard work, without a guarantee of success.

The boxed curriculum was one of the dumber things I did, but I was in a panic!  I had not even heard about deschooling!

Unfortunately I listened to the experts even until now, and put him in school for his own good.  Kennedy Krieger even came out and said that I was doing a great disservice to him by keeping him out of school. I listened to their advice and felt terrible about the fact that I could not give him a better social life and didn&#39;t fight the system more for &quot;what he deserved.&quot; I guess this as well as my own personal guilt about his medical history is clouding my ability to make this decision. <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you to the group for reading these posts, and the helpful responses.

I have a complicated relationship with my son as he <br/>\n&gt; was very sick when  he was an infant and into his toddler years.  I <br/>\n&gt; brought home a baby that would scream constantly and curl up in pain.  He <br/>\n&gt; never wanted to be held, he just wanted to sit in his bouncy chair and <br/>\n&gt; rock.  I took him to ER after ER, then doctor after doctor.  I was told I <br/>\n&gt; was a hysterical first time parent and was sent home.  I would have been <br/>\n&gt; glad to have been just hysterical, but it was later discovered that my son <br/>\n&gt; was very sick and the complications from that time are still present.  He <br/>\n&gt; was not able to hear or speak until he was almost five years old.  He <br/>\n&gt; taught himself how to lip read, and I was the only one who could <br/>\n&gt; understand him when he spoke.  Because of this, my mom radar is still very <br/>\n&gt; tuned in and I rely a great deal on nonverbal cues and &quot;reading him.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; Then I question myself wondering if I am really reading him correctly. <br/>\n&gt; His verbal skills are improving, but he still has difficulty expressing <br/>\n&gt; himself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was able to keep him in schools with small classrooms until he was to <br/>\n&gt; enter first grade.  I enrolled him in a charter school with small <br/>\n&gt; classroom size and a kindergarten/first grade curriculum.  I was assured <br/>\n&gt; that each child would be treated as an individual and get the help they <br/>\n&gt; needed.  This turned out to be a nightmare as they dropped the <br/>\n&gt; kinder/first program and expanded the classroom sizes to 25.  I had to <br/>\n&gt; pull him out in the middle of the year as he became more depressed and <br/>\n&gt; stared hating himself.  I did school at home with a boxed curriculum and <br/>\n&gt; tried to find other homeschoolers.   It wasn&#39;t as easy to get together as <br/>\n&gt; it used to be.  My son was upset that he did not have any friends during <br/>\n&gt; the week, though I invited his friends over on weekends. I put him back in <br/>\n&gt; school this year so that he could be around people his own age.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; School has not worked well.  My son was diagnosed with Asperger&#39;s syndrome <br/>\n&gt; and is considered too high functioning to be in a special education class, <br/>\n&gt; but is falling behind in the mainstream.  He feels stupid and starts to <br/>\n&gt; cry when he sees the unfinished work sheets his teacher sends  home.  He <br/>\n&gt; is being bullied on the playground, and ostracized in the classroom.  I&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt; asked him if he wanted to home school, but he says he wants to home school <br/>\n&gt; and go to school.  &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone else have issues with their children being lonely or missing <br/>\n&gt; other kids?  Will it go away in time?
