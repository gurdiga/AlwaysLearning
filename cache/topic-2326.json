It&#39;s so difficult for me, because of my stress I guess... And because it makes me anxious being where the children are. I don&#39;t know why.

Only if <br/>\nthey want, for the collège, maybe ?<br/>\n<br/>\nI read some articles from Sandra Dodd that I found passionating ! It&#39;s new <br/>\nfor me because unschooling doesn&#39;t really exist in France. Almost everybody <br/>\nignore what it means. It&#39;s difficult here, because we are controlled once a <br/>\nyear from 6 years old to 16.<br/>\nI just discovering &quot;deschooling&quot;, and it talks to me so much...<br/>\nI&#39;m discovering John Holt too, and lot of books with unschooling. For me, <br/>\nit&#39;s like if it was a family I looked for a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI try to be like I would like to be with my children, less controling what <br/>\nthey eat, when they sleep, what they do, etc... I really try because I felt <br/>\nsomething in me, recently, something let go... I feel inside the <br/>\nunschooling, but something is hard for me, the TV ! I would like to be <br/>\nconvinced that if I let Tom look like he wants, one day he will be <br/>\ninterested in the real life... I know that we have, as parents, to propose <br/>\nthen a joyfull life, an interesting life. But it&#39;s not. We try to, we leave <br/>\nin a beautifull place now, in the mountains, they can go outside when they <br/>\nwant, but they don&#39;t... Now that Tom is feeling we try to let go <br/>\nconventions, he thinks about TV all the day ! When he wake up to the <br/>\nevening, he could watch the TV if we let him do. And maybe we should let him <br/>\ndo. But for the moment, we can&#39;t...<br/>\nWhen I was a child, I watched the TV all the time. It was special, because <br/>\nmy mother could not stand that I could do other things. She needed me to be <br/>\nnear her watching TV..<br/>\nI think TV saved my life, really... For me, being a child was horrible, <br/>\ngoing to school was a nightmare, and TV helped me to forget this life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope my children don&#39;t feel like I felt when I was a child. I don&#39;t think <br/>\nso...<br/>\nIt&#39;s just when I think about the outside, the nature is so beautifull, and <br/>\nTom prefer being in front of the TV unstead of being outside playing or <br/>\nrunning or screaming. It disturb me a lot.<br/>\nDoes he need to experiment the unschooling ? Does he need to go on this way <br/>\nentirely for going out one day ? Oh ! It&#39;s so difficult to explain in <br/>\nenglish ! Maybe you will not understand what I mean...<br/>\nHe&#39;s a giftes child. We had to learn to understand him for a long time. It&#39;s <br/>\nbetter now.<br/>\nFor the moment, I&#39;m reading &quot;The unschooling handbook&quot;, and &quot;playfull <br/>\nparenting&quot;. I like them. I have difficulties for playing...
