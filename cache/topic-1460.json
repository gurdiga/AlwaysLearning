Did <br/>\n&gt;&gt;something happen at that Baptism, First Communion, Confirmation  that <br/>\n&gt;&gt;changed me?&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I was also baptised and raised in a certain faith. I don&#39;t think the act of <br/>\nbaptism or confirmation itself holds any power to change a person. I believe <br/>\nthe power comes with all the messages given to you as a child through all <br/>\nthose years of going to church and being a member of that community.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we&#39;re brought up in a certain faith, we are told from the time we are <br/>\nborn, from the most influential people in our lives, that this is The Truth. <br/>\nIt&#39;s ingrained into our psyche. It is as real as the air we breathe or the <br/>\nlaws of gravity. I never even thought to ask a question for many years. It <br/>\nwasn&#39;t until I had my son that I knew I had to really examine what I truly <br/>\nbelieved. I knew that if I truly believed in the Christian dogma, I HAD to <br/>\nhave him baptized. I couldn&#39;t play around with his eternal soul. I thought <br/>\nlong and hard, read a lot, and had many meaningful discussions. He wasn&#39;t <br/>\nbaptized and he&#39;s not going to hell. That&#39;s My Truth. I think everyone has <br/>\nto discover their own Truth.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1432,"nextTopicId":1441}}
