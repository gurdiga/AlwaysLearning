A lot of what you said rings true for me too. My partner gets stressed with mess, and when me/our family is unorganised ( I have struggled with being neat and organised my whole life, this has been an ongoing frustration for him). One of his biggest bugbears is when the evening routine doesn&#39;t go smoothly, and the kids bedtime ends up later than usual. He has a real need for peace and quiet in the evenings, and likes spending time alone with me, debriefing about the day etc, once they&#39;re in bed. It seems strange after reading a lot on radical unschooling and relaxed (or lack of) bedtimes to consider that earlier bedtimes could actually be helpful for us. I&#39;ll make more of an effort to make home a relaxing place that everyone wants to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy longterm goal *is* to have a happier family, who are connected. That includes my partner as well as the kids. Right now there is a lot of unhappiness, different reasons for everyone. Rather than focusing on unschooling as the goal, I will focus on making a more peaceful, happy home as the goal for now. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat can I actually say to my kids though, that takes their unhappiness seriously and helps them get through school in the interim? I don&#39;t want to say &quot;it will get better, hang in there&quot;. As it might not. I also don&#39;t want to mention the possibility of homeschooling in future in case that doesn&#39;t happen. Some well-meaning people have told them things like &quot;all kids complain about school, life isn&#39;t fair&quot;. That doesn&#39;t feel right to me. So far I&#39;ve been empathising, eg &quot;Sorry you&#39;re finding it hard. What can I do to help you/make it easier?&quot; I feel like my token efforts aren&#39;t having much impact.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope it&#39;s ok to ask that even though it&#39;s school-related. I understand if you remove that section of my post. This is a long-shot, but are there any groups for people who are not actually unschooling but would like to be, and have to work *with* school for now?

I am in Australia too. \nMy experience with this and the general vibe wrt play-based&nbsp; learning is \nthat its just another name for sneaking in academics when the kids are having \nfun and “hey they don’t even realise it! “ (I am not a proponent).&nbsp; I don’t \nbelieve any parent who adheres to schooly education would tolerate pure play for \npure play’s sake. It would need to be proven that there are very fun ways to \nlearn academics and that by having fun they will learn (which is true and IS \naligned with unschooling but in this case its motivated by a bunch of hidden \nagendas). Its couched very nicely to appeal to the mainstream. </font></div>\n<div><font size=\"4\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font size=\"4\">I might be off the mark here but that’s my impression. Lots of \nscared parents do well with lovely play based talk (I am not saying your husband \nis scared just parents in general who send their kids to school who are scared \nto take them out because they don’t see any other option). At least that’s been \nwhat I have noticed in the community where I live. I am the only homeschooler \nhere where I live who isn’t using a curriculum and who is learning how to let go \nand live into the unschooling philosophy. </font></div>\n<div><font size=\"4\">(I just want to add that I too am a scared parent at the \nmoment... but that’s not because I am scared about the lack in academics. That’s \nthe least of my worries. My big fear is allowing technology into our lives and \nthe power that it is having which is the subject of whole different \nthread).</font></div>\n<div><font size=\"4\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font size=\"4\">Also, just as an aside. I bought Rue Kreams’ book from the US \n(it was $32 Aus) and its been worth every cent as far as getting my husband on \nboard with this unschooling journey we are now on. My husband read it and is a \ncomplete convert to the unschooling philosophy. Its had my pretty awe struck to \nbe honest as he has been as strict as me wrt sugar and tv and such. Now he’s the \nstrong one helping ME to let go. Go figure! I recommend it if your husband is \nwilling to read it (we had an agreement that if he read that then I would read \none of his business coaching books!

One other aspect of her approach which is \naligned with unschooling is the idea that children develop at their own pace \nwhen they are developmentally ready and that trying to force them to do \nsomething they&#39;re not ready for is unhelpful and can be detrimental to their \nprogress. <br></p>\n<p\n style=\"FONT-SIZE:13px;FONT-FAMILY:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;COLOR:rgb(0,0,0);FONT-STYLE:normal;BACKGROUND-COLOR:transparent;\"><br>If \nyou are looking for something as a bridge between the structure of school and \nunschooling, and a way to make your husband feel more at ease with what you&#39;re \ndoing at home, then it could be a starting point.

One other aspect of her approach which is aligned with unschooling is the idea that children develop at their own pace when they are developmentally ready and that trying to force them to do something they&#39;re not ready for is unhelpful and can be detrimental to their progress. <br></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><br>If you are looking for something as a bridge between the structure of school and unschooling, and a way to make your husband feel more at ease with what you&#39;re doing at home, then it could be a starting point. My husband was uncertain about homeschooling and using a play-based learning approach (with a view to easing in to unschooling) is proving incredibly helpful. <br></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><br></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\">I also used the curriculum page on Sandra&#39;s site to write an overall &#39;curriculum&#39; at the start of this year, outlining goals for the year.

He got to see the &quot;worst&quot; of unschooling without any indicators that it was better than school. </p><p style=\"background-color:transparent;\"><br>Make a compromise for the next school year/term (I don&#39;t know how that works in Australia) - the kids tried school and it wasn&#39;t a great experience, so you could try homeschooling. Something &quot;with more structure&quot; than unschooling so your partner isn&#39;t so panicked about it, and he agrees to back off and give it &quot;a fair chance&quot; - two months isn&#39;t enough for any kind of progress.<br><br>Do a bunch of research into different homeschool methods, materials, and curricula so he doesn&#39;t get the impression you&#39;re just winging it - have a plan and a couple backup plans (most homeschoolers find their first choice method or curriculum isn&#39;t perfect and need to make changes). Plan to need to prove yourself and your methods to your husband - read the &quot;curriculum&quot; and &quot;checklist&quot; pages at Sandra&#39;s site for some ideas in that regard, so you&#39;re not stuck with worksheets, but also realize that something like worksheets might be enough to get him to calm down - just like if you lived someplace where you needed to provide documentation. It&#39;s up to you to reassure him that you&#39;re doing right by his children. Since they&#39;ve had a rough school experience, they may be more cooperative in terms of jumping through those kinds of hoops than they would have been previously. <br><br><span style=\"line-height:13.555554389953613px;\">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html<br></span>http://sandradodd.com/checklists<br></p><p style=\"background-color:transparent;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;font-style:normal;\"><br></p></div></span></blockquote></div></div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Back & forthing, school & unschooling","postDate":"1391947496","msgId":73505,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEIzNjVFMDEwLTg3RTYtNEUwMi04N0FBLUFFRUM4QzE2N0QyRUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGxkNTA5aStydTkxaGRAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGxkNTA5aStydTkxaGRAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":73488,"nextInTopic":73533,"prevInTime":73504,"nextInTime":73506,"topicId":73478,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On Feb 8, 2014, at 5:18 AM, keznco@gmail.com wrote: Rather than focusing on unschooling, focus on what you want unschooling for.

Plan to need to prove yourself and your methods to your husband - read the &quot;curriculum&quot; and &quot;checklist&quot; pages at Sandra&#39;s site for some ideas in that regard, so you&#39;re not stuck with worksheets, but also realize that something like worksheets might be enough to get him to calm down - just like if you lived someplace where you needed to provide documentation. It&#39;s up to you to reassure him that you&#39;re doing right by his children. Since they&#39;ve had a rough school experience, they may be more cooperative in terms of jumping through those kinds of hoops than they would have been previously.&nbsp;<br><br><span style=\"line-height:13.555554389953613px;\">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html<br></span>http://sandradodd.com/checklists<br></p><p style=\"background-color:transparent;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;font-style:normal;\"><br></p></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":543849229,"authorName":"","from":"&lt;keznco@...&gt;","profile":"vespertine_nsw","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Back & forthing, school & unschooling","postDate":"1391854706","msgId":73478,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGxkNTA5aStydTkxaGRAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":73479,"prevInTime":73477,"nextInTime":73479,"topicId":73478,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi all.

It felt like with these threats hanging overhead and the constant reference to it being a trial, rather than a proper commitment, it was difficult to be joyful. So after only a short period- 2 months or so- I felt like I had made a bad decision. My partner said one night, I know you really want to do this but I think it&#39;s just adding more stress to our lives and I think we should enrol the kids into the new school.
