We went somewhere far away that she was familiar with and where there were people we both loved and trusted who could help with childcare and living.

Some adults cause significant harm to their children. You need to be honest with yourself - is this who he is? If so, there&#39;s nothing worth working towards in terms of a life &quot;together&quot; at this point in time - maybe that will change, maybe it won&#39;t. My daughter&#39;s father has asked for us to try again repeatedly over the past 4 years but he still drinks, still uses lots of drugs, is still crazy, unsafe and unpredictable. My daughter has asked repeatedly to never have to live close to him again (he can be one of the funnest dads in the world but he&#39;s also terrifying and hurtful)</div><div><br></div><div>After we left, I made it a point to never speak poorly of him and to try to explain that the things he&#39;d done and was continuing to do weren&#39;t about her, or about his love (or lack of) for her. Recently, she told me she needed me to stop &quot;defending him.&quot; And she was right - he is hard to deal with, he can be a self-centered ass, he plays head games with her - she doesn&#39;t need to know &quot;why&quot; I think he does those things, she just needs someone to listen while she unloads</div><div><br></div><div>That&#39;s a longwinded warning to be careful about what you say - yes, tell them he&#39;s gone on a journey but realize that at some point, they may well see that journey as him choosing that over them and it will hurt.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I grew up in a divorced family where one parent constantly bad-mouthed the other.

Ideally, you&#39;ll find somewhere you can afford help at home or, perhaps, have family/friends who can help.</div><div><br></div><div>Facilitate as much communication with him as your children want. If/when that changes, support that change. When my daughter told me last year she didn&#39;t want to see or talk to her dad for a bit I had to push back the idea that she &quot;needs&quot; him.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Find a counselor - no excuses.

You loved him, he&#39;s the father of your kids, and he&#39;s impossible to be with right now. Your love is important because it keeps away your own self-loathing and darkness- maybe he&#39;ll figure things out? Wrath won&#39;t help him get there but, honestly, your love won&#39;t either.

For us it is the unschooling version of separation and divorce, it gives help and advice on a very different way.

You know he is very unhappy. Perhaps, at this point, it makes sense to encourage him to go away for a while if he needs to, so he can be happy. Encourage him to stay in touch and reach out to the children, wherever he is. Be sweet, let him know you are telling him to go, because you care about him (not because you are angry). Make sure to use positive language with the kids. Dad is on a voyage of self-discovery. He loves you, he&#39;ll always love you. Look on a map where Dad is, learn about the area.

For a long time after the move he would no be able to help financially or to come and visit the children. He leaves the responsibility of the children in my hands and says he will be able to help in a vague &quot;one or two years&quot;. <br><br>I am really not sure what else I could do to prevent this. I tried my best to follow the advice from the thread in May although I do have troubles juggling full time work, looking after the children when I&#39;m at home, and trying to deal with his unhappiness. I have read some the websites originally suggested, and books, but I haven&#39;t been able to go to counseling as yet because of financial and time constraints. <br><br>I don&#39;t want to break our family, I&#39;d love for my children to experience their dad every day and have him in their life. To find the man I fell in love with again and to grow together. To hug and kiss and discuss things. I have no idea how to change his mind anymore and it does feel like a one-sided endeavour and a bit silly and stubborn at that. <br><br>He looks after the children while I work full time and I have no idea how they will react to the abandonment. They are extremely attached to him. He doesn&#39;t want to be a stay-at-home dad but he declined going to work with me re-arranging my schedule. I can&#39;t work any less at present because of our visa situation and because I&#39;m the only one providing income. I find it difficult to enjoy work because I know he is at home and not liking it and difficult because I&#39;d rather work part-time and look after my children more. <br><br>My husband has been having an extramarital relationship for more than one year now, knowing that I am aware of it and not stopping it despite my pleading. I feel hurt as a woman and as a wife. We have been living together throughout this entire time but physical affection is now very rare. He is profoundly unhappy with himself and with his life and I feel suffocated by all this negativity and the feeling of responsibility. I feel that I wasn&#39;t able to help him and maybe he would indeed be better off without me. My self esteem has become pretty low and feel guilty for a lot if things: &quot;If I had done, this, that, the other, he would have been happy&quot;. Some of his actions have been pretty damaging for my trust in him and I feel unsafe with him at the moment (not as in physical violence but with my heart). <br><br>I&#39;ve told him that I&#39;m still prepared and willing to work on us but I do find it difficult while he carries on this relationship. He has repeatedly said that his other relationship is not the issue and that we had problems as a couple even before. He also says that even if I could forgive him he can&#39;t forgive himself. He still carries on. <br><br>He has pretty much told me that &quot;we don&#39;t work together&quot; and that to make it work he &quot;would need to change too much&quot;. That this is the end of us. He still says that he loves me but has to go away to be a better person for his children and himself. Because he&#39;s a &quot;shell of a person&quot;. He is still living with us and this makes it even more difficult for me to comprehend. I don&#39;t understand what he means by love and why he&#39;s still here. <br><br>I don&#39;t understand how this can be good for my children to experience and if it is still worth for me to keep trying. I don&#39;t think at all that separation would make everything better, but at this point maybe being away from us would indeed make him happier and myself less resentful and guilty. Less wrapped up in his negativity. <br><br>How would you prepare children for separation if everything else fails?<br><br>How would you support them? And yourself? <br><br>Thank you all <br><br>------------------------------------<br>Posted by: Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt;<br>------------------------------------<br><br><br>------------------------------------<br><br>Yahoo Groups Links<br><br>&lt;*&gt; To visit your group on the web, go to:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/?soc_src=mail&amp;soc_trk=ma\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/</a><br><br>&lt;*&gt; Your email settings:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Individual Email | Traditional<br><br>&lt;*&gt; To change settings online go to:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/join?soc_src=mail&amp;soc_trk=ma\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/join</a><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (Yahoo!

I don’t think you should.  I think you should tell them he needs to go, for a while.  <br clear=\"none\">\n<br clear=\"none\">\n-=-I don&#39;t understand what he means by love and why he&#39;s still here. -=-<br clear=\"none\">\n<br clear=\"none\">\nSo you want him there but you want him gone?  It might be good to mourn the loss of the relationship you had and not try to bring it back.  If he moves back and you are together again, he will not be the shell of the person you fell in love with, but he won’t be that original person in those days and times, either.  <br clear=\"none\">\n<br clear=\"none\">\nThis part I understand the very least:<br clear=\"none\">\n-=- I have read some the websites originally suggested, and books, but I haven&#39;t been able to go to counseling as yet because of financial and time constraints. -=-<br clear=\"none\">\n<br clear=\"none\">\nDaycare will cost money now, (or school could be used as daycare).  It will cost him money to travel.  It will cost, still, to pay for regular expenses.  <br clear=\"none\">\n<br clear=\"none\">\nIt may be too late for this family, but not for others.  If you need help, GET help.  There are some people here who are unschoolers or who know lots about unschooling and most of them could help with family peace and harmony:  http://sandradodd.com/issues/therapy<br clear=\"none\">\nIt might cost more time and money to find an in-person local marriage counsellor, and many of them will spend two or three sessions trying to figure out what the hell unschooling is and then telling you that THAT is your problem.  I’d like to think that it’s NOT the problem, but in case it is, I hope the counsellors on my page would recognize that early and advise you on tweaking unschooling so that it is building cohesion and not being divisive.<br clear=\"none\">\n<br clear=\"none\">\n-=-How would you prepare children for separation if everything else fails?-=-<br clear=\"none\">\n<br clear=\"none\">\nYou should figure out what you’re going to do when/if he leaves, and tell them THAT, and bypass any frightening “I have no idea what’s going to become of us now!”  Get your plan and your soothing ideas ready.  You’re not being blindsided, and that’s good!<br clear=\"none\">\n<br clear=\"none\">\nI hope others will have ideas about these and the other questions, too!<br clear=\"none\">\n<br

","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-841625426\">Anonymously presented; outrage and defensive ideas probably won’t be helpful, so let’s go with peace and future, please.<br/>\n________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote some time ago to ask for advice and wisdom on saving my marriage (Email posted anonymously by you 23/5/16 on Always Learning). <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is an update followed by questions. <br/>\n<br/>\n[NOTE FROM SANDRA:  If someone could bring a link to that earlier discussion and post it here, I’d appreciate it.]<br/>\n---------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nMy family situation has developed in the sense that my husband has decided (for many months now) that the only solution to his and our problems is to leave the family and move to the other side of the world to find himself and experience things he feels the urge to do. For a long time after the move he would no be able to help financially or to come and visit the children. He leaves the responsibility of the children in my hands and says he will be able to help in a vague &quot;one or two years&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am really not sure what else I could do to prevent this. I tried my best to follow the advice from the thread in May although I do have troubles juggling full time work, looking after the children when I&#39;m at home, and trying to deal with his unhappiness. I have read some the websites originally suggested, and books, but I haven&#39;t been able to go to counseling as yet because of financial and time constraints. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to break our family, I&#39;d love for my children to experience their dad every day and have him in their life. To find the man I fell in love with again and to grow together. To hug and kiss and discuss things. I have no idea how to change his mind anymore and it does feel like a one-sided endeavour and a bit silly and stubborn at that. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe looks after the children while I work full time and I have no idea how they will react to the abandonment. They are extremely attached to him. He doesn&#39;t want to be a stay-at-home dad but he declined going to work with me re-arranging my schedule. I can&#39;t work any less at present because of our visa situation and because I&#39;m the only one providing income. I find it difficult to enjoy work because I know he is at home and not liking it and difficult because I&#39;d rather work part-time and look after my children more. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband has been having an extramarital relationship for more than one year now, knowing that I am aware of it and not stopping it despite my pleading. I feel hurt as a woman and as a wife. We have been living together throughout this entire time but physical affection is now very rare. He is profoundly unhappy with himself and with his life and I feel suffocated by all this negativity and the feeling of responsibility. I feel that I wasn&#39;t able to help him and maybe he would indeed be better off without me. My self esteem has become pretty low and feel guilty for a lot if things: &quot;If I had done, this, that, the other, he would have been happy&quot;. Some of his actions have been pretty damaging for my trust in him and I feel unsafe with him at the moment (not as in physical violence but with my heart). <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve told him that I&#39;m still prepared and willing to work on us but I do find it difficult while he carries on this relationship. He has repeatedly said that his other relationship is not the issue and that we had problems as a couple even before. He also says that even if I could forgive him he can&#39;t forgive himself. He still carries on. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe has pretty much told me that &quot;we don&#39;t work together&quot; and that to make it work he &quot;would need to change too much&quot;. That this is the end of us. He still says that he loves me but has to go away to be a better person for his children and himself. Because he&#39;s a &quot;shell of a person&quot;. He is still living with us and this makes it even more difficult for me to comprehend. I don&#39;t understand what he means by love and why he&#39;s still here. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t understand how this can be good for my children to experience and if it is still worth for me to keep trying. I don&#39;t think at all that separation would make everything better, but at this point maybe being away from us would indeed make him happier and myself less resentful and guilty. Less wrapped up in his negativity. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow would you prepare children for separation if everything else fails?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow would you support them? And yourself? <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77617,"nextTopicId":77622}}
