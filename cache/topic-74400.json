Vague mushy feeling. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m honored that she chose that event in Rochester where she and Alex and I spoke to launch Life through the Lens of Unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPam wrote:<br/>\nIt&#39;s been great fun putting it together—the print book is a whopping 309 pages!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as a thanks to you guys for being a part of the community, I have a special launch price of $2.99US for the ebook and $11.99US for the print edition (you&#39;re welcome to share it at the introductory price with your groups and communities as well). In about a week they will go to their regular list prices of $4.99US and $13.99US, respectively.<br/>\n<br/>\n+++++++++++++++<br/>\n<br/>\nAmazon being mysterious. they have listed it for a dollar less than that, even.  I could be irritated with Amazon (which I sometimes am, because they undercut my price on their site, with some of my own books :-)  ), OR BETTER... I could let you know that at least the American offering is even less than Pam listed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Life-through-Lens-Unschooling-Companion/dp/0987733370/\">http://www.amazon.com/Life-through-Lens-Unschooling-Companion/dp/0987733370/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nEuropeans can get it from amazon.co.uk<br/>\n£7.14<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Life-through-Lens-Unschooling-Companion/dp/0987733370/\">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Life-through-Lens-Unschooling-Companion/dp/0987733370/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd anyone anywhere, I think, can get a kindle version (or iPad, if you download the kindle reader).<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=ntt_athr_dp_sr_1?_encoding=UTF8&field-author=Pam%20Laricchia&search-alias=digital-text\">http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=ntt_athr_dp_sr_1?_encoding=UTF8&field-author=Pam%20Laricchia&search-alias=digital-text</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56837,"nextTopicId":74339}}
