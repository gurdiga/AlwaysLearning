We are renting and have a very small income, but I can still search for Ikea storage furniture on EBay & I can check with my landlord whether I would be allowed to fix some small hooks to the roof for a soft toy hammock. My daughter adores her large collection of soft toys, they take up a lot of space though (currently in large laundry bins) so a hammock over her bed would be great. Those plastic tubs are a brilliant idea- the lidded ones on wheels for under the bed are good too and cheap. A similar idea I saw on Pinterest today was to salvage drawers from old ruined dressers, put castors on the bottom and roll them under things (I know of someone who is about to throw a couple of dressers out too- perfect!)

Right now all of our board games are stacked in one corner. At various points in time, we&#39;ve had video games, books, dvds, bins of Pokemon action figures/Legos/blocks/arts & crafts supplies/assorted toy guns, and so forth stacked against / pushed up against the walls. When my son was younger, I often used laundry baskets to contain toys, and it was easy to shove those out of the way up against the wall, plus it was easy to stack 2 of them (when it could be done without being a hazard, such as when filled with stuffed animals). <br/>\n<br/>\nWe also made use of folding tables of various sizes. If we had a project we wanted to keep set up, we set it up on a folding table and then shoved the table against the wall when we needed the middle-of-the-room space -- the laundry baskets with toys, bins of blocks, and puzzles could easily be pushed underneath those folding tables. If we had company and needed the space, it was easy to fold up the tables and temporarily slide them behind the couch or armchair. TV tables are good for smaller projects (and for eating on if the dining room table is being used for other than eating!).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there&#39;s room underneath your kids&#39; beds, you can get some pieces of plywood cut into easy-to-manage sizes and use those as work surfaces, then slide them with projects intact right under the bed. My son&#39;s bed is low, but I found some shallow lidded plastic bins that will fit under his bed. Lids wouldn&#39;t be needed if the bins contained things your kids wanted to access often. Bed trays (they look like mini-TV trays) provide a good stable surface and don&#39;t take up a lot of space when set up -- plus they&#39;re easy to tote from one room to another.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son&#39;s bedroom has a shelf way up high on one end of the room and we store things up there that he rarely uses anymore, but isn&#39;t quite ready to let go of.

You might also look for small plastic tables - the kind people use outdoors. Or plastic steps-stools can make good tiny tables And you can lay a board over several for a bigger table.

You can buy ‘leaf’ tables that are super narrow when down but can be made bigger when needed. Hang things off the walls, in bags or specially made storage hangers. String a hammock above a bed for light things such as stuffed toys. Take board games out of boxes and store the bits in plastic zip lock bags. Lay a blanket out for the toddler to play on so if it needs to be tidied in a hurry you can just pick up the four corners of the blanket and move the whole thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally, the best way for me is, ‘a place for everything and everything in it’s place’. If everything has a clear and practical place to go, it is very easy to tidy up quickly...plus the children always know exactly where to find what they need. Shelves and boxes and baskets, utilise every bit of space you have, right up to the ceiling if you need to.
