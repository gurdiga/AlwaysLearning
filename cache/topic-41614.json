There&#39;s more to do than you can possibly do in one <br/>\nvisit (and remain sane).  Note that most of the Smithsonians close <br/>\nearly, but some may be open until late, so plan accordingly and do get <br/>\ntickets first thing in the day for the Washington Monument and the <br/>\nmoney printing place.  They may run out completely in the afternoon.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe way lucked out last year.  We were just bummed about missing the <br/>\nMonument again (it was under construction the time before) and a tour <br/>\nguide thought I looked like someone he knew, so called me over, but <br/>\nthen when he heard we wanted to go in, gave us a private tour. :)  <br/>\nVERY nice to go up in that elevator all alone with your family and a <br/>\ntour guide!  And he snuck us down to the next level that is caged <br/>\noff.  You used to be able to walk up and down the monument - I did <br/>\nthat when I was a kid, but now they don&#39;t allow it and they have cool <br/>\nElectrochromic Windows that show you the different blocks by each <br/>\nstate as you go down.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nrel.gov/buildings/electrochromic_basics.html\">http://www.nrel.gov/buildings/electrochromic_basics.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, there&#39;s tons to do in DC. :)  The most important thing is to <br/>\nENJOY!

The<br/>\n&gt; Smithsonians are all grouped together and can be done as much or as<br/>\n&gt; little as you like. American History was just reopened after<br/>\n&gt; renovations, and I haven&#39;t been to see what kinds of changes they&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; made, but it never used to be a favorite. Hopefully they&#39;ve made it more<br/>\n&gt; hands-on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My kids have always loved the Natural History museum, which is<br/>\n&gt; definitely young-kid friendly.

Their cafe is really cool, set up cafeteria style with different<br/>\n&gt; areas representing the foods of different native regions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s also the Bureau of Engraving where you can see money being made,<br/>\n&gt; the National Archives with the Declaration and Constitution. The<br/>\n&gt; Holocaust museum is amazing, but definitely takes quite a bit of time<br/>\n&gt; and I wouldn&#39;t recommend it for younger kids--I&#39;m waiting till mine are<br/>\n&gt; older to go there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Newseum is supposed to be pretty cool--a history of news media. I<br/>\n&gt; love the Botanic Gardens, which is right across the way from the<br/>\n&gt; American Indian museum and would take only a half day.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The art museums are wonderful, and the sculpture gardens are really cool<br/>\n&gt; too--a great place to bring a picnic lunch on a nice, sunny day.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you have the opportunity, the monuments are absolutely amazing to see<br/>\n&gt; at night--an experience that you&#39;ll never forget.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Feel free to email me off list if you&#39;d like.

An<br/>\nalternative is for a small fee, you can reserve them in advance online<br/>\n(Smithsonian website).

They usually celebrate the culture of one state, one<br/>\ncountry and another theme (last year was NASA)<br/>\n<br/>\nSights - Washington Monument - although going up in it is free, you will<br/>\nneed a ticket.  You have to get there early and stand in line to get a<br/>\nticket (which is timed).  They only give out tickets for that day. An<br/>\nalternative is for a small fee, you can reserve them in advance online<br/>\n(Smithsonian website). If neither works out for you an alternative is going<br/>\nup into the Old Post Office Tower.  Not as high, but still a good view.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to go to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing you will need<br/>\ntickets for that also.  You may be able to go through your State Congressman<br/>\nor Representative to get a tour at a specific time if you don&#39;t want to<br/>\nstand in line.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to tour the White House you&#39;ll need to request a tour through<br/>\nyour State Senator at least a month in advance - read asap since it&#39;s end of<br/>\nJan.  You can also schedule a capitol tour through your state senator.   The<br/>\nCapitol conducts tours too but I think the tours conducted by the senators<br/>\noffices are smaller # of people and may cover more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe front car on the metro is usually the least crowded.  Follow the metro<br/>\netiquette, people will yell at you - sad but true.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure there&#39;s more that I can&#39;t think of at the moment.  Feel free to<br/>\nemail me off list for more info.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nWendy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":229237531,"authorName":"Danielle Conger","from":"Danielle Conger &lt;danielle.conger@...&gt;","profile":"danielleconger","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] help planning DC trip","postDate":"1233358782","msgId":41620,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ5ODM4RkJFLjIwNjAyQGdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDkwMTMwMTczOC5uMFVIY0lHZjA0MTUyNUBzaGVsbC5sbWkubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDkwMTMwMTczOC5uMFVIY0lHZjA0MTUyNUBzaGVsbC5sbWkubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":41619,"nextInTopic":41621,"prevInTime":41619,"nextInTime":41621,"topicId":41614,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The <br/>\nSmithsonians are all grouped together and can be done as much or as <br/>\nlittle as you like. American History was just reopened after <br/>\nrenovations, and I haven&#39;t been to see what kinds of changes they&#39;ve <br/>\nmade, but it never used to be a favorite. Hopefully they&#39;ve made it more <br/>\nhands-on.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have always loved the Natural History museum, which is <br/>\ndefinitely young-kid friendly. The Air and Space is great, and the annex <br/>\nout at Dulles is supposed to be wonderful, so if you can fly in there it <br/>\nmight be a great way to get to the airport early.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Spy museum is supposed to be really cool, and we really like the <br/>\nMuseum of the American Indian, which, btw, has the best food in the <br/>\narea. Their cafe is really cool, set up cafeteria style with different <br/>\nareas representing the foods of different native regions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s also the Bureau of Engraving where you can see money being made, <br/>\nthe National Archives with the Declaration and Constitution. The <br/>\nHolocaust museum is amazing, but definitely takes quite a bit of time <br/>\nand I wouldn&#39;t recommend it for younger kids--I&#39;m waiting till mine are <br/>\nolder to go there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Newseum is supposed to be pretty cool--a history of news media. I <br/>\nlove the Botanic Gardens, which is right across the way from the <br/>\nAmerican Indian museum and would take only a half day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe art museums are wonderful, and the sculpture gardens are really cool <br/>\ntoo--a great place to bring a picnic lunch on a nice, sunny day.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have the opportunity, the monuments are absolutely amazing to see <br/>\nat night--an experience that you&#39;ll never forget.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to email me off list if you&#39;d like. I went to college in DC <br/>\nand we&#39;ve lived in the area for the past 7 years.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~Danielle<br/>\nEmily (11), Julia (10), Sam (8)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.organiclearning.blogspot.com\">http://www.organiclearning.blogspot.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] help planning DC trip","postDate":"1233358472","msgId":41619,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEEyMDQyMDIwLTU5QzgtNEIzNC1COEFFLTkyOEU5NDcxNTYxM0Bjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDkwMTMwMTczOC5uMFVIY0lHZjA0MTUyNUBzaGVsbC5sbWkubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDkwMTMwMTczOC5uMFVIY0lHZjA0MTUyNUBzaGVsbC5sbWkubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":41618,"nextInTopic":41620,"prevInTime":41618,"nextInTime":41620,"topicId":41614,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve never been to D.C., but I ve always wanted to see the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. http://thewall-usa.com/information.asp Robin B.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-684089051\">I&#39;ve never been to D.C., but I&#39;ve always wanted to see the Vietnam  <br/>\nVeterans Memorial.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thewall-usa.com/information.asp\">http://thewall-usa.com/information.asp</a><br/>\n<br/>\nRobin B.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] help planning DC trip","postDate":"1233356460","msgId":41618,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkxRDQ1NDdFLUNDMDQtNDcyMi1BOEM2LTdENkY4OUNDMjRFNEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDkwMTMwMTczOC5uMFVIY0lHZjA0MTUyNUBzaGVsbC5sbWkubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDkwMTMwMTczOC5uMFVIY0lHZjA0MTUyNUBzaGVsbC5sbWkubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":41616,"nextInTopic":41619,"prevInTime":41617,"nextInTime":41619,"topicId":41614,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

That&#39;s one cool room.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are statues and art in and on the buildings all over the place.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s an FBI tour and you get to see all the tommy guns confiscated  <br/>\nin the early 20th century.

The tour might be too slow and boring for  <br/>\nyounger kids, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt American history there are things like Howdy Doody and Fonzie&#39;s  <br/>\njacket and other TV icons.   Trains.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh!  Current displays, too.  Sometimes there&#39;s something out on the  <br/>\nmall.  Once we saw examples of traditional wooden construction from  <br/>\nlots of different countries--little buildings had been made in all  <br/>\nkinds of traditions out there.   Another time there were foods and  <br/>\ndances of South Africa (I forget why), and there was a display on New  <br/>\nMexico once when I was there.  Kinda odd.  And once on the Ainu, of  <br/>\nJapan.    So those won&#39;t be there but something else wonderful will  <br/>\nbe!
