There are some kids that I allow in my pantry and some kids that I <br/>\ndon&#39;t.  That is a general hospitality thing, that you shouldn&#39;t expect that you <br/>\ncan go raid someone else&#39;s pantry.  If visiting guests don&#39;t like what is being <br/>\nserved, then they don&#39;t need to eat.  As a hostess, you should offer as much as <br/>\nyou can, the foods that you KNOW they will eat.  It doesn&#39;t need to be a free <br/>\nfor all.  If I know that a kid is going to come over and eat all the family <br/>\nfavorites, I will put out some of those things along with other things and put <br/>\nthe food up that I don&#39;t want to be eaten.<br/>\n<br/>\n***i should add that the parents and the kids are great people and that we enjoy <br/>\ntheir friendship and want to keep it. might this be a case where i should speak <br/>\nto the other parents and let them know it would be easier for me if they had the <br/>\nsame rules for their kids at my house that they have for them at their own? i do <br/>\nthink it might be easier for me to just say, sorry, your mom doesn&#39;t want you to <br/>\nplay on the computer now, than for my kids to have to struggle to coax their <br/>\nfriends away to do something else for at least part of the play time <br/>\ntogether.***<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you like this family and you want those kids around, I wouldn&#39;t ask the <br/>\nparents to change their rules to accommodate yours.  You can be sweet and <br/>\ngenerous in simple ways that is not an all or nothing.  If those kids like your <br/>\nfood and your computers, offer those things as a hostess, but it doesn&#39;t need to <br/>\nbe all of your food and all the time usage.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSimple and delicious foods that fill kids up that kids like to eat doesn&#39;t need <br/>\nto be potato chips.  I made a bunch of bagels yesterday for visiting guests.  I <br/>\nalso made pasta.  Both of those things are cheap and easy (well I like making <br/>\nbagels so it feels easy).  I&#39;ve never had a kid turn down bagels.  You can make <br/>\na whole platter of bagel bits with all kinds of things on them, cream cheese, <br/>\ncream cheese and jam, butter, meat slices, melted cheese, chocolate frosting, <br/>\netc.  I&#39;ve also never had kids turn down berries, or apples with caramel, or <br/>\nchips and hummus, or homemade pizza.  With little kids I&#39;ve always liked popcorn <br/>\nand popsicles, especially for neighbor kids that are over a lot and are always <br/>\nhungry.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think navigating groups of kids should undo the deschooling process. <br/>\n It&#39;s a matter of being a hostess.  You can talk to your family in advance about <br/>\nwhat you guys want to do for that visit and what foods you want to serve and <br/>\nwhat activities you want to do.  It doesn&#39;t need to be hard and fast, but a <br/>\ngeneral idea, and then the adult hostess needs to make it happen.  Visiting <br/>\nneighbor kids are trickier because they drop by unannounced!  Have ideas in <br/>\nadvance, keep neighbor kid food around and neighbor kid activities to do.  For <br/>\nmore special planned guests, it&#39;s actually more fun to plan something more <br/>\nspecial.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":367876564,"authorName":"cgeorgenow","from":"&quot;cgeorgenow&quot; &lt;cgeorgenow@...&gt;","profile":"cgeorgenow","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Other Parents Rules At Our House","postDate":"1279568600","msgId":56211,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGkyMjlzbytva2oyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDUwMTU4MC40OTI3NC5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDEubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":56209,"nextInTopic":56214,"prevInTime":56210,"nextInTime":56212,"topicId":56146,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ==I never allowed her to use our computers again after that.

They dont have a computer to play on at their house, and they have an old game system , but dont really have any games to play. (and they dont &#39;get a new game&#39; when they want it)  My mom can barely stand to babysit them because they fight and dont engage in anything for any amount of time, (yet hell play on the computer for 8 hours straight here- I just let him ) and when she picks them up from school for my sis, they are fighting halfway down the street.  They fight alot, and my sister is the kind who punishes, coerces, and bends and twists them alot. (lots of needless rules, guilt, etc...)  My kids (3 of them) get along beautifully, and the games, etc... are something they enjoy doing together as well as separately.

For the past couple years, the parents will usually tell this boy that he has to play outside when he comes here.  I guess sometimes they don&#39;t tell him he has to play outside, so that&#39;s when he plays inside and will play on the computer or play other video games.  They have even taken our laptop or DS&#39;s out onto the deck outside when his parents say he can&#39;t play inside.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anyway I guess it&#39;s come to a head with the parents, because when the boy came over on friday, my son and the other neighbor were playing the Wii and invited this boy to join them.  He said &quot;I can&#39;t play video games&quot; and turned his head away with a very sullen look:(  Then he kept saying &quot;come on guys, I can&#39;t play video games, let&#39;s go outside&quot;.  My son ended up stopping and going outside with the boy while the other neighbor continued to play the Wii.  After a couple hours my son wanted to show this boy a game on the computer and he said &quot;I can&#39;t get on the computer or I&#39;ll have to go home&quot;, so my son didn&#39;t get on the computer.

The parents have even said recently &quot;the boys can play at our house&quot;, and their son will say &quot;no, I want to play here&quot; (meaning our house).  I guess I just feel bad for this kid, because I think he comes to our house to escape the rules and controls put on him at his own house, and now they&#39;ve yanked some of that away from him even when he&#39;s at our house by forbidding him to get on the computer or play video games while here.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Does anyone else have issues with friends coming over and their parents &quot;rules&quot; coming with them?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I know it leaves my sons (ages 8 & 4) perplexed as to why one of their friends wouldn&#39;t be able to come to our house for the sole reason of playing on a computer or playing a video game.

They don&#39;t know how to navigate <br/>\nonline territory, they go to sites that could potentially harm your computer and <br/>\nthey explore things that they shouldn&#39;t.  One such neighbor kid, at a sleep <br/>\nover, after everyone went to sleep, got online and surfed porn all night.  We <br/>\nfound out because it downloaded viruses that killed that computer.  I never <br/>\nallowed her to use our computers again after that.  It turns out, that&#39;s all she <br/>\nreally wanted from the friendship, so she stopped coming over.  Two other kids <br/>\ndid similar things.  All three of those kids were either forbidden or had high <br/>\ncomputer controls at their own houses.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy own kids have never explored the internet in unsafe ways.  They&#39;ve always <br/>\ngone to age appropriate sites and have been very careful to not click on <br/>\nsuspicious things.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, my advice, based on our experiences with kids like that, is IF you allow <br/>\nthem to use your games and computers, is to be upfront about the fact that it is <br/>\nup to them as to whether or not they want to obey their family rules, that you <br/>\nwon&#39;t hide it if asked, and if they use computers, monitor ALL their activities <br/>\nhighly.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Other Parents Rules At Our House","postDate":"1279480223","msgId":56155,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk5REU1RDE4LTUwQzUtNEQ5MC1COEUwLTExMzAzQTQ5RjdEQUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGkxdmkyaStxcGNhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGkxdmkyaStxcGNhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":56152,"nextInTopic":56159,"prevInTime":56154,"nextInTime":56156,"topicId":56146,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- Let them know that it doesn t help Him to be shown the games - yes, the rule sucks and you don t agree with the boy s parents, but you can t change them.=-","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-847170408\">-=- Let them know that it doesn&#39;t help Him to be shown the games -  <br/>\nyes, the rule sucks and you don&#39;t agree with the boy&#39;s parents, but  <br/>\nyou can&#39;t change them.=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think Meredith was recommending saying that to the neighbor  <br/>\nkid, nor will saying it that bluntly to your children add to peace.   <br/>\nThey could easily repeat it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI such cases I used to remind my kids before the visitor was coming  <br/>\nover, and ask if they were willing to do something different with  <br/>\nhim.

I dont understand the &#39;no tv, video game, computer&#39; mentality anyway......Its a shame you cant talk to the parents, or help them see the situation differently.  I dont have issues with others &#39;rules&#39; persay ,but I will say my newphews (there are 2) come over and the first thing they do is disperse, and find a computer or game system to get on.  They dont have a computer to play on at their house, and they have an old game system , but dont really have any games to play. (and they dont &#39;get a new game&#39; when they want it)  My mom can barely stand to babysit them because they fight and dont engage in anything for any amount of time, (yet hell play on the computer for 8 hours straight here- I just let him ) and when she picks them up from school for my sis, they are fighting halfway down the street.  They fight alot, and my sister is the kind who punishes, coerces, and bends and twists them alot. (lots of needless rules, guilt, etc...)  My kids (3 of them) get along beautifully, and the games, etc... are something they enjoy doing together as well as separately.  I wish more people would see the benefits of games, computers, dvds, even tv,  etc..........<br/>\nIts great that this kid has your house to come over to, and maybe there is a way for his parents to see things differently.  They even have Wii&#39;s now in hospital rehab&#39;s etc......I think these people arent probably &#39;hip&#39; to what all is out there and available in the world of multimedia.  Maybe enlightening his parents a bit ( if thats possible) might help.?!  good luck :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Julie van der Wekken&quot; &lt;thewekkenfam@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My last post, back in May I believe, had to do with neighbor kids coming over and I got lots of good feedback and things have been going very well this summer in regards to 3 different neighbor kids coming over regularly.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One issue that has cropped up recently is that one of the boys that comes over (age 9) is forbidden from playing video games or playing on our computer while he is here.
