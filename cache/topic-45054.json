The idea was that it was going to be as close to a democratic school as it could be, considering that it&#39;s a public school and so would have to follow state curriculum and the students would have to have end-of-grade tests in certain years. (not at all like a democratic school, in other words) One of the hopes for the school was that the classes would use the Positive Discipline approach; they&#39;d hold class meetings, there wouldn&#39;t be punishments, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat idea was quickly discarded, though, when the mostly-white group of founders was outvoted by the parents whose kids had been accepted into the school - the majority of whom had African-American and high-needs kids. I couldn&#39;t understand how *anyone* would choose to do things differently. Positive Discipline made so much SENSE to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was deeply affected when an African-American mom explained that her son was *already* followed in stores by security, they were already viewed with suspicion because they were black. She believed her son didn&#39;t have room to make mistakes, because the consequences for him, as a black male, would be so much worse than for a white privileged kid. She said, &quot;He will be under my thumb until he is grown and gone. I will not lose him in that way.

Sadly we can be slow on<br/>\nthe uptake for so many things.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWith bottle feeding and nursing, the racial division seemed to show.    <br/>\nWhen bottle feeding was seen as something people did if they could  <br/>\nafford to, it took some people longer to be able to afford it, and by  <br/>\nthen there was a movement toward figuring out, again, how to  <br/>\nbreastfeed.  In a population where breastfeeding had been associated  <br/>\nwith poverty, they didn&#39;t WANT to do that, and arguments about health  <br/>\nand closeness did not trump the celebration of being able to afford  <br/>\nformula and cute bottles.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn another area of thought, we had a young woman join this list or  <br/>\nmaybe Unschooling Discussion years ago, and she was about to move from  <br/>\nLouisiana or Mississippi (maybe someone remembers the story) to New  <br/>\nYork.  I think she was living with her dad, but was going to be with  <br/>\nthe father of her child/children.   I also thing some of her relatives  <br/>\nwere from the Caribbean.   Sorry to be vague.  Her questions were  <br/>\nabout discipline and spanking, and when people advised other ways to  <br/>\ndeal with behavior situations without spanking, she assured us it was  <br/>\na tradition in her culture that she couldn&#39;t break, or some such.    <br/>\nShe felt she had no option but to spank, being in her dad&#39;s house, or  <br/>\nwhatever all.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a book and I&#39;m not thinking of the name of it, but it&#39;s about  <br/>\nthe residual effects of manumission and recovery from slavery within  <br/>\nsome families, and spanking seems to be a part of it.   Not a healthy  <br/>\npart of it, but partly justified by &quot;my forefathers were whipped  <br/>\nand...&quot;   Something about power.  Something about reaction.   And I  <br/>\nread some of that when my friend Tony was risking his family&#39;s peace  <br/>\nand future with his controlling and baffling behavior.   It seemed  <br/>\nthat from Tony&#39;s point of view, the way he was treating his mid-kid V.  <br/>\nwas so far beyond spanking or &quot;whippin&#39;&quot; (in the southern with-a- <br/>\nswitch meaning) that he *must* be being a generous, liberal parent,  <br/>\nbecause he wasn&#39;t striking his child.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if someone feels &quot;his culture&quot; requires strict discipline, and then  <br/>\nthere&#39;s a fundamentalist Christian overlay reinforcing that, it might   <br/>\nbe that unschooling is too far a stretch for this lifetime, for this  <br/>\ngeneration.    Respect for children might be a philosophical luxury  <br/>\nsome people can&#39;t afford.   If a child is &quot;equal&quot; in value to an  <br/>\nadult, where and what then is the value of being an adult?   (I see  <br/>\nthat in some of my friends and family who white as all getout, and  <br/>\nsome who are hispanic/northern New Mexican, and families with combo/ <br/>\ncoyote kids [not &quot;kuy otee&quot; in English, but &quot;cohYOteh&quot; in Spanish]).<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is always a case-by-case deal, and there&#39;s rarely any  <br/>\nfamily for whom it&#39;s a simple, easy decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother aspect of why there might not be more unschoolers of color (to  <br/>\nstay with that phrase, thinking of the international makeup of this  <br/>\nlist) is that there can be pressure from &quot;a community&quot; to be different  <br/>\nfrom &quot;the others&quot; (non-Christians, or &quot;white people&quot; or rich people or  <br/>\nintellectuals or hippies or whatever is identified with the &quot;out  <br/>\nthere&quot; weird or dangerous anti-them).<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a co-worker who grew up in the South Valley in Albuquerque  <br/>\n(rougher, more &quot;ethnic&quot; than other parts of town), went to Rio Grande  <br/>\nHigh (had a rough reputation in those days), said she used to hide  <br/>\nrazor blades in her hairdo and get into fights with other girls.  She  <br/>\nwas African American.   (Still is, but we lost contact fifteen years  <br/>\nago or so. &lt;g&gt;)  She was interested in the SCA, and went to a  <br/>\ntournament with me, but because some of her neighbors razzed her about  <br/>\ndressing up and going to hang out with white folks, she was  <br/>\nembarrassed to continue.  She saw value in bowing to pressure from  <br/>\nneighbors.   She wasn&#39;t the only Black person in the club, but there  <br/>\naren&#39;t lots.   Those who are there tend to play VERY well, and I think  <br/>\nit might be because they&#39;ve already sacrificed some peace and &quot;face&quot;  <br/>\nto go and do that, and they&#39;re getting some razzing from friends and  <br/>\nrelatives, too, to play at the history of Europe (though it&#39;s not just  <br/>\nthat).<br/>\n<br/>\nMore clues and questions; not &quot;the answer.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Parents of color and unschooling","postDate":"1242305180","msgId":45089,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENCM0YwNTlDLTFDOUQtNDM3OS05MTAzLUY0N0Q2Rjg4MDVDMEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxYmEwMWM5ZDQ0NCQ2NDgwZDg0MCQyZDgyODhjMCRAY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGd1ZmVpNCtuaDQwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NjYyODNFQjYtRkNGRi00Q0M3LTlCMzctMTgwRUY5NDc0N0JDQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8MDFiYTAxYzlkNDQ0JDY0ODBkODQwJDJkODI4OGMwJEBjb20+"},"prevInTopic":45086,"nextInTopic":45091,"prevInTime":45088,"nextInTime":45090,"topicId":45054,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- That’s the group that talks A LOT about curriculum, and not nearly enough about children having fun and learning through living. :(-=- Oh.

And it&#39;s not helpful to add  <br/>\nanother difference (homeschooling) to another difference (being a  <br/>\nminority) if the goal is to find stability in the mainstream.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone was here a couple of years ago who was looking for solutions  <br/>\nto some problems, but said she couldn&#39;t let go of the tight reins and  <br/>\nthe need to push her sons to prepare themselves for college because  <br/>\nof the social pressures in her area that would pull them down and  <br/>\nsuck them in. (I&#39;m not remembering her situation clearly but she may  <br/>\nhave been divorced and it sounded like her community wasn&#39;t stable.)  <br/>\nMost blacks have cultural roots in the south where control of kids is  <br/>\npart of the culture.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn less stable areas there is social pressure for people not to rise  <br/>\nup out of it. Those who rise up are termed traitors to their kind and  <br/>\nheritage. If the &quot;failures&quot; can keep others from succeeding, then  <br/>\nthey can create the illusion they aren&#39;t failures. Which isn&#39;t a  <br/>\nghetto thing.

They may be making it worse, but a community of stable  <br/>\nstrong families can be armor against a great deal. But the stable  <br/>\nfamilies are surrounded by too many families that aren&#39;t stable and  <br/>\nstrong.

There are plenty of unreliable  <br/>\ndrug, alcohol and wife-abusing men of any color, but I think there are  <br/>\ndifferent fears and concerns associated with different situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was first unschooling there was a mom who had a newsletter for  <br/>\nfamilies of color, and she was the go-to person about this topic.   <br/>\nDonna White was her name, in case you find some of her writings out  <br/>\nand about.  She ended up divorced.  :-/<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere I live there are lots of mixed race families (in New Mexico),  <br/>\nfor what that&#39;s worth.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne Black family here was unschooling and the dad became more and more  <br/>\nirritable and irritating as he MySpace got older.  He&#39;s a retired air  <br/>\nforce officer (captain, I think) with a PhD (mostly gotten while he  <br/>\nwas in the air force, the Master&#39;s, anyway).   They have three kids,  <br/>\nabout the ages of Marty and Holly and then one younger, and we&#39;ve  <br/>\nknown them for a long time.  Ten years, maybe.   When the kids were  <br/>\nyoung, things were okay, but the mom and the boy who&#39;s most like her  <br/>\n(a throwback to that other conversation about kids who are like a  <br/>\nspouse one&#39;s not too happy with) started to balk at the too-many rules  <br/>\nand surprise conditions.  The family is fairly granulated this year.    <br/>\nI could go on.  But they&#39;re separated (not divorced) and the oldest  <br/>\ngirl, who did NOT go to school before, is at Stanford.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second one, the boy who&#39;s so much like his mom and who has taken  <br/>\nthe brunt of dad-crazy, was compelled to go to The Albuquerque  <br/>\nAcademy, the fanciest school in town.  He didn&#39;t want to go.   This is  <br/>\nhis senior year, and he&#39;s about to graduate, I think.   Probably.      <br/>\nHis dad made him go because he said Black boys who without a high  <br/>\nschool diploma won&#39;t be able to get a job or get into college.   He  <br/>\nwas wrong, but he liked finding out what V. wanted to do and then  <br/>\ndoing the opposite. I&#39;ve watched it for years.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this past four years V. went from a healthy football-player looking  <br/>\nguy (pudgyish at 13) to a 100 pound hospitalized bulemic.   He ran  <br/>\naway, and the only way we could get any messages to him was his mom to  <br/>\nme, me to Holly, and notes left on, where he had claimed to be East  <br/>\nIndian, and later Middle Eastern (not that kids care so much about  <br/>\nprofile stuff, but he was denying his heritage as hard as he could).<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope he&#39;ll be okay.  He used to have the greatest spark in him, but  <br/>\nhe&#39;s a shell.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe youngest is probably 14 or so now, and is at Menaul, another  <br/>\nprivate school, and a boarding school.  I don&#39;t know whether he&#39;ll be  <br/>\nput into the Academy too.  He&#39;s much more like his dad, though, and  <br/>\nwill survive it better.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling didn&#39;t go well in that family because (in my opinion, from  <br/>\nmy observation) the dad was a controlling prick who blamed church, and  <br/>\nhis mom was a controlling mother he was paying way more attention to  <br/>\nthan he was paying to his wife.   I&#39;ve seen him do horrible arbitrary  <br/>\ncruel things to that middle child.   Sadistic.  Not physical, but  <br/>\nemotionally and mentally just horrible.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy ideas here might be some of those easy border pieces that anyone  <br/>\ncould have worked, and nothing that will really help you, but I&#39;m  <br/>\nchucking out what little I have for others to riff on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still in contact with Kris Williams who used to post on AOL as  <br/>\nRaisinNSun (or something like that spelling).
