You can look at  <br/>\nindividual paintings and zoom in on the details, read notes about the  <br/>\nartwork and the artists, hear audio commentary, learn more about the  <br/>\nmuseums and other works.

The Italian gallery choices are riots of color  <br/>\nwhich I love; the German ones are much more subdued. It&#39;ll be  <br/>\ninteresting to see how the other countries&#39; galleries compare in theme  <br/>\nand style.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin B.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59390,"nextTopicId":59320}}
