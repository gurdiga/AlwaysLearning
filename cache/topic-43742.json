I keep a small baggie of wipes in my purse. My daughter could still care less if she has sticky hands or whatever else, my son on the other hand doesn&#39;t mind getting dirty but insists on being cleaned up ASAP. I also tend to take a couple of paper towels folded up as well. My son has never liked the sound of the electric hand dryers. They terrified him as a baby, I learned later once he was able to tell me it hurt it his ears. Though there have been times he can be seen following me out of the public restroom drying his hands on my bum, of course using his own is out of the question that would make them messy. But I have been a human napkin on more than one occasion whatever works. I do now tend to look for moms with two and under, they always have a diaper bag with them, if I am out of supplies. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for walking through parking lots, crossing the street and a refusal to hold hands. Our solution was a game in parking lots. The cross walks are train tracks and we either hold hands and chug right along or the kids would grab the bottom of my shirt and hold tight while I made train noises. The 4 of us (hubby included) can be found in parking lots doing this even now. Crossing the street we explained that a car or truck is coming down the road they won&#39;t so see them, so they need to hold a finger so that they can be seen. I didn&#39;t grasp their hand I offered a finger or two, whatever their hand could fit around and let them hold on. We also talked about looking both ways before crossing. The freedom of being able to move from here to there on your own is amazing to little ones and there is nothing in this world faster than a 2 yr old on a mission of exploration. I do suggest a good pair of running shoes. My son learned to walk at 8 months old, he has<br/>\n two speeds stop and go. So in a store that has buggies, I ask him if he wants to push the cart. He is just now tall enough to reach the actual handle but we got many a laugh going through the store with me guiding while his head was down and his arms on the legs it looked like I had an extra set of small feet. If we were lucky enough to be in a store that had race car buggies, police cars buggies, etc those have been the best, he gets to &quot;drive&quot;. He loves to help when we are out and about so I do what I can to make sure there are things he can help with, such as putting items in the buggy, putting them up on the check out belt. He is fascinated with the U-Scan aisles we have in so many stores now. <br/>\n<br/>\nPublic places such as parks and such, when either of the kids were 2 I just prepared myself to be on the go constantly and stayed right behind them. So many things to look at, so many things to try and climb on. Good running shoes, two pair actually, expect for one to be muddy at any given time. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nTammy Curry, Director of Chaos<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tammycurry.blogspot.com/\">http://tammycurry.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://crazy-homeschool-adventures.blogspot.com/\">http://crazy-homeschool-adventures.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If a child is to keep alive his inborn sense of wonder, he needs the companionship of at least one adult who can share it, rediscovering with him the joy, excitement and mystery of the world we live in.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRachel Carson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287815876,"authorName":"Robyn L.

How can both of these principles be met <br/>\nat the same time? One way that helps is to engage even a 2 1/2 year old in <br/>\nthe process. Rather than imposing your short list of solutions, ask her, <br/>\nbefore she gets out of the car, what she would suggest. Discuss each <br/>\nsolution seriously with the pros and cons, even the silly to adult ears <br/>\nideas - even the &quot;I cross by myself&quot; ideas. It&#39;s OK to say, &quot;Well I know <br/>\nthat would be fun for you and you would feel like a big girl, but I would be <br/>\nfeel scared that someone in a big car wouldn&#39;t see you by yourself. What <br/>\nelse could we do?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAllow plenty of time. This is really key. Allow more time to discuss these <br/>\nmindful parenting solutions - they do take longer than dictating and <br/>\nexpecting compliance. My experience is that they take longer than dictating <br/>\nand then arguing too - but the discussions way more fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes people have demonstrated the danger of parking lots by doing <br/>\nfascinating things at home like rolling over a soda can in the car, or <br/>\nmaking a game (at home in the driveway) of  inviting the child to sit in the <br/>\nfront seat and showing how hard it is to see someone little outside (like a <br/>\nhide and seek).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the food-sample-denial case the principles were something like <br/>\nConvenience, or maybe Control. I don&#39;t think either of those are useful if <br/>\nyou are looking for unschooling principles. At my place Curiosity is going <br/>\nto trump Convenience almost every time. I would have been so pleased to see <br/>\n2 1/2 yo Jayn&#39;s willingness to try a new food that no amount of mess would <br/>\nbe the least problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers learn to be aware of the hidden lessons that our children might <br/>\nbe inadvertently learning through our actions. I think it&#39;s part of both <br/>\ndeschooling and our personal development to gain this awareness. If the <br/>\nunintended lesson is &quot;Mommy&#39;s mean&quot; or &quot;Mommy doesn&#39;t trust me&quot; or &quot;Mommy <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t care what I want&quot; then that inner voice is most likely going to <br/>\ndrown out the information that you are hoping would be heard like &quot;Parking <br/>\nlots are dangerous&quot;. The emotional reactions and emotional needs, especially <br/>\nof littler folk, are going to override their intellectual knowledge much of <br/>\nthe time.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling takes spending time. Facilitating our own mindfulness with our <br/>\nchildren can take pre-planning - like *always* carrying spare clothes in the <br/>\ncar, or always having crayons and a little sketch pad, or always carrying a <br/>\ncouple of snack bars in our purse, or keeping the sand toys in the trunk. <br/>\nAll kinds of little plans that mean we get to say &quot;yes&quot; over and over <br/>\nwithout fears or worries.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Don&#39;t take her to the grocery store or <br/>\nother places where there will be parking lot problems. If you avoid it <br/>\nas often as possible, then you won&#39;t have many power struggles. Don&#39;t <br/>\nmake a flat rule that she can&#39;t walk on her own in ANY parking lot - <br/>\nlook around and decide if it really is dangerous. Only restrict her if <br/>\nthere is actual real danger. Ask her to walk right beside you. Play a <br/>\nwalking game as you go to the car - you take a step, she copies yours. <br/>\nIf you take 3, she takes 3.

We found alternatives.  Sometimes he <br/>\nliked riding in the shopping cart, but not often-that&#39;s rather  confining. When <br/>\nI could, I found (and still do, as he&#39;s still learning about  traffic safety) <br/>\nparking spots next to the building or walkway directly to the  building, so <br/>\nwe don&#39;t have to cross the car-driving area. Sometimes, holding  onto brother&#39;s <br/>\nhand or onto the cart or a bag handle will work. Sometimes,  if I don&#39;t have <br/>\nto take the shopping cart to the car, we can hold hands and  &quot;race&quot; with each <br/>\nother. Sometimes he likes to ride on the end of the cart-either  the far end <br/>\nfacing me or the near end between myself and the cart with our hands  together <br/>\non the handle. Sometimes, he&#39;s willing to hold his brother&#39;s hand.  Sometimes, <br/>\n(like yesterday) he&#39;s agreeable that I hold onto the  back of his shirt or <br/>\njacket. Sometimes I can carry him. Some days, more often  when it first started, <br/>\nbut very rarely now, *nothing* seems to be okay. On these  occasions, I stop <br/>\nand kneel next to him and we talk about safety and big cars  and soft bodies. <br/>\nI think once or twice (in the beginning) we couldn&#39;t come to a  compromise and <br/>\nhe had no inkling about watching for cars and I ended up carrying  him <br/>\nunwillingly to the car. Now that he&#39;s 4, it is easier for me to keep a watch  out <br/>\nfor cars *for* him in those &quot;nothing else will do&quot; situations, as his  movements <br/>\nare much less erratic than when he was 2. I occasionally talk to him  *and* <br/>\nhis brother about how high the backs of cars are and how drivers can&#39;t see  <br/>\nthem when backing up, and to keep an eye out for that, too.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe talked about alternatives outside the moment-sometimes  while waiting in <br/>\nthe checkout line, sometimes while we were putting on our  coats, occasionally <br/>\nwhen we were going into the store. It seemed to help if they  had a fresh <br/>\nreminder of what was going to happen when we left the store to go to  the car. <br/>\nMost all these ideas came from other unschooling parents on Yahoo  groups when <br/>\n*I* was at my wit&#39;s end about him not holding hands in the parking  lot. :~) It <br/>\nis *so* helpful, sometimes, to get some input from someone who&#39;s not  in the <br/>\nmiddle of the stress.<br/>\n <br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nDe<br/>\n**************Feeling the pinch at the grocery store?
