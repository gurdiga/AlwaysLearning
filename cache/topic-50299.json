It&#39;s about the idea of &quot;starting late.&quot;  I&#39;ve put a new page  <br/>\nand a new index page (with just a few links so far) here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/later/unschooling\">http://sandradodd.com/later/unschooling</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/later\">http://sandradodd.com/later</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe assumption of most unschooling discussions is that it&#39;s something  <br/>\nparents do when they decide to pull a child or a family of children  <br/>\nout of school.  I know I&#39;m an exception, having started before &quot;school  <br/>\nage&quot; with many of the principles that became common in &quot;radical  <br/>\nunschooling.&quot;  There&#39;s so much online now that someone can come by and  <br/>\nthink &quot;OH, I can do better than that...&quot; and declare herself  <br/>\nretroactively to have been unschooling for four years, because her  <br/>\nchild is four and still not in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny person who takes ANY advice has a responsibility to be careful  <br/>\nwho&#39;s giving it and why.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe vast majority of unschoolers whose kids are now teens started at  <br/>\nsome point after the child was five or six.  So the questions will be  <br/>\nabout the family&#39;s ability to change course, and to adapt to new  <br/>\nideas.   One parent cannot decide that unilaterally.  It needs to be  <br/>\ncarefully considered.   Then the balancing problem becomes how quickly  <br/>\nand how much time for gradual change?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere isn&#39;t a formula, past the deschooling formula which existed when  <br/>\nI came around years ago, at one month per year of schooling (or  <br/>\nschoolishness, the unschoolers added later, because if people go from  <br/>\nschool to school at home, that&#39;s not the kind of deschooling that  <br/>\nunschooling needs).<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people seem to think unschooling is something the kids will do on  <br/>\ntheir own if they&#39;re brought home, and the parents continue to live  <br/>\ntheir own lives, and the kids are expected to &quot;direct their own  <br/>\neducation.&quot;  I&#39;ve never liked that term.  It sends people in the wrong  <br/>\ndirection.   It is &quot;getting cold,&quot; to think of &quot;child led&quot; whatever,  <br/>\nor of children &quot;being in charge&quot; of their own learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf parents are unwilling to attempt to become expert enough in how  <br/>\nunschooling works to get it to work WELL at their own home, then they  <br/>\nshould really leave their kids in school.  Bringing kids out of school  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t magically create an unschooling environment.   By &quot;expert  <br/>\nenough&quot; I don&#39;t mean enough to charge other people money to advise  <br/>\nthem.  I mean expert in the sense that one can be a good unschooling  <br/>\nparent even if awakened in the middle of the night, or on a day when  <br/>\nthe mom is sick, or the car doesn&#39;t run and you&#39;re low on groceries.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the parents get to the point that they ARE unschooling parents,  <br/>\nthat they know how to make decisions that will help unschooling  <br/>\nthrive, then they can start to see the benefits.  As long as they&#39;re  <br/>\nasking other people &quot;now what?&quot; they need to keep working on reading  <br/>\nand asking and trying little bits and seeing what makes things  <br/>\nbetter.  At some point, though, they should be able to do it without  <br/>\nmuch hand-holding.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list exists to help people get to the point that they have  <br/>\nconfidence in their ability to make those kinds of little choices in  <br/>\nthe smallest of moments.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/choices\">http://sandradodd.com/choices</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/deschooling\">http://sandradodd.com/deschooling</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50120,"nextTopicId":50301}}
