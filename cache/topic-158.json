If you click on one, you&#39;ll get a very brief synopsis - maybe <br/>\n2 or 3 sentence description of the article. Most are pretty much English as <br/>\nopposed to Math-ese. Then, if you want to read the actual article, you can <br/>\nclick on that and it takes you to it. I just had a look at one that started, <br/>\ninterestingly, with the following first paragraph:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Ian Stewart was turned on to mathematics at the age of seven. A broken <br/>\ncollarbone freed him from an uninspiring teacher allowing his mother to <br/>\nignite his interest in numbers while he was laid up at home. &quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThe above is from the article about Magical Numbers in Nature.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - not all articles are really lay-person accessible (hey - maybe you <br/>\ndon&#39;t realize this, but not all math articles are intelligible to all <br/>\nmathematicians -- I can read lots of statistics-related articles, but not <br/>\nadvanced articles in any other field of mathematics, for example, and, to be <br/>\nhonest, there are MANY statistics-related articles that are off in such <br/>\nspecialized areas that I can&#39;t make sense of them) but anyway - these are <br/>\narticles that were written, usually, for the regular person, not for <br/>\nmathematicians and they can be kind of inspiring and informative in giving <br/>\nyou a feeling for what math is REALLY all about.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":141,"nextTopicId":164}}
