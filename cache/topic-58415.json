I find that<br/>\npeople coming at unschooling/life learning from either right wing or left<br/>\nwing perspectives cannot fully appreciate the freedom or the space to build<br/>\nrelationships with their families that accompany this lifestyle choice.  I<br/>\nconsider myself apolitical, though I had a libertarian tell me I am a<br/>\nlibertarian.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is really helpful to me acknowledging and appreciating my century and<br/>\nmy country;  remembering that the ideas that there is a right and a left are<br/>\nideas from the French Revolution.  They were the seating plan with radicals<br/>\non the &quot;left&quot; and &quot;conservatives&quot; on the right.  Their ideas of<br/>\nconservatism, liberalism, and other isms were different from modern ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my observations is that adherence to a religion or ideology doesn&#39;t<br/>\nserve families well if it stops them from developing strong relationships.<br/>\n My relationship with my spouse and kids trumps any passing fancy I may<br/>\nhave.  The thing about political divisions is that they serve political<br/>\ngroups very well with the right and the left carving up the population<br/>\nnicely.  I am always labelled a Fascist by left wing people and a Communist<br/>\nby right wing people.  I like to pick and choose from a smorgasbord of ideas<br/>\nas an individual--this can be very upsetting to those who like to carve up<br/>\nthe world as being either left(anti-corporate, pro group/state control of<br/>\nindividuals, pro-environment) or right(pro-hierarchical family, anti-birth<br/>\ncontrol, and religious).  I know that is simplistic analysis and there are<br/>\nlots more &quot;divisions&quot; that those I listed which people from the left and<br/>\nright use to demean one another or advance their own agendas, but I picked<br/>\nthose as my example.  If you believe in families, but not hierarchical<br/>\nfamily are you right wing or left wing?   I don&#39;t care really what the<br/>\nanswer is, but many people who call themselves radical unschoolers care that<br/>\nyou be &quot;green&quot;, that you breastfeed and that your visions match theirs.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeredith wrote:<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Statements like that ignore the fact that &quot;adult advocacy&quot; can include<br/>\nsupport like saying &quot;yes&quot; to a child wanting to buy something he or she sees<br/>\nin a commercial, or looking for ways to help a child feel in control of<br/>\nprogramming&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think though the article has an agenda.  My kids don&#39;t just need an<br/>\nadvocate, but they need parents who love them and trust them: parents who<br/>\nare  in their lives who want to be with them.

Otherwise the child is being told something<br/>\nakin to &quot;yes you can have that yucky or addictive thing but it&#39;s a bad<br/>\ndecision on your part&quot; and that interaction can lead to less trust because<br/>\nthe parent(s) imply that the child is incompetent to make decisions and<br/>\nlearn. Don&#39;t think that your child&#39;s trust is dependent on what others do<br/>\nbut on parents.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is THE most common mainstream parenting practice that I&#39;ve seen used to <br/>\ncontrol and manipulate children.  It is born out of fear.  Parents fear that <br/>\ntheir children will think, believe, act, do, or become someone or something that <br/>\nthe parents believe to be wrong or bad.  As much as I love and trust my <br/>\nchildren, even *I* have moments where I go to that place in my thoughts until I <br/>\nrealize those thoughts aren&#39;t my own, but hold over beliefs of others, usually <br/>\nconservative religious beliefs born in fear.  <br/>\n<br/>\nChildren can and do push comfort boundaries.  Even the sweetest kindest most <br/>\nwell behaved child will at some point push the comfort boundaries of their <br/>\nparents.  If a parent has a big laundry list of things to fear, there will be <br/>\nmore comfort boundaries to push.  That parent will feel as if the world is full <br/>\nof things to avoid, full of things to keep their child away from, full of things <br/>\nto control.  The place that I came to, is that if I don&#39;t attempt to control, <br/>\ncombined with letting go of all those things to fear, that I can truly see the <br/>\nworld as a big beautiful place to live and grow and learn in, and I can truly <br/>\nsee my children as happy positive people that aren&#39;t out to do terrible things <br/>\nthat will ruin their lives.  The more I let go of control and the less I fear, <br/>\nthe better my relationship with my children is.  The comfort boundaries are <br/>\neasier to navigate because they are clearer, fewer, and more defined.  Since <br/>\nthey are, it&#39;s easier to work through them and easier to talk to my children <br/>\nabout, since *I* am clearer and more defined about fewer things that cause me <br/>\ndiscomfort.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s it, it&#39;s MY discomfort, not theirs and that&#39;s a big important thing <br/>\nto remember.  The only way, that I can see that works, to have a child truly <br/>\ncare about my discomforts is to truly let go of fear and control.  Parents can <br/>\nand do fear and control.  Some parents more than others.  Relationships between <br/>\nparents and children have been destroyed because of it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling doesn&#39;t work well when there is fear and control, the very nature of <br/>\nfear and control puts walls up where there should be openness.  One can&#39;t learn <br/>\nin big happy ways when there are walls up.  Not everyone sees that or wants <br/>\nthat.  Some people want walls up around their children, they want to control <br/>\ntheir children and will do so at whatever cost for whatever fear based reason <br/>\nthey have.  And the ONLY way to do that is to control and manipulate.  Parents <br/>\ndo that in small ways with TV and food, when the kids are young, and large ways <br/>\nthrough groundings and punishments, when the kids are older.  One parent I know <br/>\nin real life has done this in a very large way by putting her child in a reform <br/>\nplace away from her to be retrained to believe that she, the child, is damaged <br/>\nand needs to be fixed so that she can come back home to accept her mothers <br/>\nfears, values, and world views.  That&#39;s an extreme example, but it DOES happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is so much easier and so much more pleasant to do the internal work, as the <br/>\nparent, to let go of the fear and control and in so doing you can have a <br/>\nrelationship with your children that is truly born of mutual respect.  That is <br/>\nthe most beautiful side effect of unschooling.  KNOWing that fear and control <br/>\ncan&#39;t allow happy learning to flourish and letting that idea unfold and ripple <br/>\ninto the whole of your lives, is really a wonderful life blessing that I never <br/>\never expected!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Wendy Priesnitz and Life Learning Magazing, Interesting article online","postDate":"1292351986","msgId":58464,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGllOGRsaSt1aWl1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGllNnJsYStjNWxjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58463,"nextInTopic":58470,"prevInTime":58463,"nextInTime":58465,"topicId":58415,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ********************* Statements like that ignore the fact that adult advocacy can include support like saying yes to a child wanting to buy something","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-881586886\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;The problem is that these things  like many other harmful things that our children encounter today  are designed by corporations to be addictive and to exploit children&#39;s trust.

Otherwise the child is being told something<br/>\nakin to &quot;yes you can have that yucky or addictive thing but it&#39;s a bad<br/>\ndecision on your part&quot; and that interaction can lead to less trust because<br/>\nthe parent(s) imply that the child is incompetent to make decisions and<br/>\nlearn. Don&#39;t think that your child&#39;s trust is dependent on what others do<br/>\nbut on parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is why I prefer the monkey platter concept (<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/eating/monkeyplatter.html)\">http://sandradodd.com/eating/monkeyplatter.html)</a> over the addiction model.<br/>\nThe monkey platter concept can refer to other arrays of choices, a &quot;plate&quot;<br/>\non which the parents can assemble a collection of the child&#39;s ideas and<br/>\npreferences of things to do for consideration. The concept can be extended<br/>\nto be about more than just eating or food. The key is not to put everything<br/>\nimaginable up for consideration but to put out an attractive array. That&#39;s<br/>\nstrewing in my opinion. If something on there is not good at the moment for<br/>\none or more people involved then it can be set aside for another time.<br/>\nPerhaps the rest of the choices can be dived into to the satisfaction of<br/>\nthose involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe things one can learn from monkey platters! If a parent isn&#39;t wild about<br/>\none of the choices, that parent can nonetheless enjoy their child&#39;s<br/>\nenjoyment, just as I can partake of food on a monkey platter even if I&#39;m not<br/>\nwild about one food (or more) but have only a small enjoyment of it purely<br/>\nfor myself. What if Karl is nuts about nuts while I avoid them? What if he<br/>\nloves Angry Beavers while I watch only a few snippets? What if I want<br/>\nnothing but apple slices while Karl eats all the chocolate? What will<br/>\nhappen?! It will be good. Karl and I will feed each other the idea that<br/>\npeople have diverse interests and preferences, and that it&#39;s possible to<br/>\ndelve a little bit into things we wouldn&#39;t necessarily go for if we were the<br/>\nonly ones there. Karl introduces me to tons of things I&#39;d probably never get<br/>\ninto on my own. And the same is true in reverse. I have introduced Karl to<br/>\nthings he might never have thought to choose.

There isn&#39;t a corporate secret plot to take advantage of school- and family-damaged kids.  They want to make money, but that in itself is their duty to their stock holders.  Some people here ARE stock holders.  It&#39;s good for my family if people go to Pixar movies and to Disneyland, stockmarket-wise (slightly, indirectly good for us).  Does it make me a part of an evil corporation, that Keith had stock options at work and opted in?<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling isn&#39;t intended to avoid being a target of evil.  I hope people aren&#39;t thinking unschooling is some sort of magical inoculation. Living in the real world and learning to deal with it in thoughtful and open ways is a kind of inoculation against cluelessness and helplessness.   People who let others do their thinking and deciding and labelling for them are in danger of being swayed and taken advantage of for social and political purposes, no doubt.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter who says, writes, or does ANYthing, each other person should look at that in light of everything else he or she knows, and make a personal judgment about whether it&#39;s closer or further from hopes and goals and intentions.   I see e-mails from my older relatives in Texas, and I feel glad I am not as conservative-Baptist as they are.  I see the parts that make them happy (church fellowship and Jesus) and the parts that make them unhappy (fearful prejudice and political propaganda), and I love that they knew my dad when he was growing up, but that&#39;s all I love about them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone might look at me and love that I can sing and that I unschooled, but not love my goofy hobbies or messy house.  Other friends of mine love that I&#39;ve saved art supplies and books and old newsletters and documents they want to borrow sometimes, and that I have extra cloth and trim, but they think unschooling is odd and aberrant behavior.   I can&#39;t be everything to everyone; I can&#39;t even be everything to ANYone.  Even my husband has other friends.  My kids have lots of other friends.  I guess Kirby goes a week or two without even thinking about me now that he has lived in another state for over three years.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can only live in my body, see through my eyes, and assimilate and synthesize patterns and ideas from things I perceive, read or hear about.  In my life, I have very few boogeymen.  I have a lot of peace and safety.  Some people prefer for their daily lives to be fraught with danger, conspiracy and persecution.  I think that in most cases, that&#39;s more thought and attitude than reality, it&#39;s unhealthy to collect fears and worries.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Wendy Priesnitz and Life Learning Magazing, Interesting article online","postDate":"1292332105","msgId":58457,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRFQjcyNjBBLUE0NTktNDMwOC05OUUwLUQ3Njg2QTVCMjdFOUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGllNnJsYStjNWxjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGllNnJsYStjNWxjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58456,"nextInTopic":58458,"prevInTime":58456,"nextInTime":58458,"topicId":58415,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

If you are feeling at loose ends, think about the things you missed having time for when your kids needed more of your time and start dabbling in those. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen, several years ago, my son seemingly (to me!) overnight went from wanting me to be his playmate during most of his waking hours -to- being substantially more self-sufficient and also spending lots of time gaming online with friends, I would find myself walking around the house wondering what to do (I mean, other than housework, which isn&#39;t at the top of my list of fun things to do!). It felt so strange to have that kind of time on my hands!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI started watching lots of cooking shows and dabbling in the kind of cooking I&#39;d never had the time or energy for before then. I tried a variety of crafts until I found a couple that I absolutely love, then I jumped wholeheartedly into those (which could actually pan out into a paying gig at some point in the future if I want to pursue that). I enjoy being able to spend long chunks of time reading. I felt that I finally had the time and energy to invest in having dogs, so we got two puppies. I putter around the house, inside and out, fixing things up, painting as we have the money and I had the &quot;oomph&quot;, etc. These are the things *I* enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\nHanging on the wall of my &quot;woman cave&quot; (as my hubby refers to it LOL) is an ongoing list of things I want to do. When I find myself walking around the house at loose ends, I&#39;ll check out the list for ideas. (I include inside-the-house and outside-the-house ideas, because sometimes I *need* to be outdoors doing something and my kiddo doesn&#39;t want to go anywhere, so I like having ideas of physically-active things I can work on outdoors without leaving home.)<br/>\n<br/>\n2. It can be easy to fall into a &quot;same ole, same ole&quot; rut. Even if your kids are not complaining about their days, it can be fun to change things up. Rather than suggesting things to them or waiting for them to ask you to help with something, surprise them! <br/>\n<br/>\nFor example: Use the furniture and sheets and blankets to set up a fort inside the house. Fix it up inside with pillow and flashlights (or lamps) and snacks, then invite them to join you inside the fort. If they&#39;re not interested in joining you right then, enjoy it by yourself! Don&#39;t make it *just* for them, rather make it something you&#39;ll enjoy, too. Part of the fun comes from making it and setting it up so it&#39;s ready to be used.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could surprise them with a treasure hunt, indoors or out. Or an obstacle course. Your local library or Family Fun magazine&#39;s website are good places for ideas of fun things to do. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, coming up with ideas and then implementing them as surprises is a huge amount of fun for me. The icing on the cake is enjoying those surprises with my kiddo. <br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":67727291,"authorName":"wtexans","from":"&quot;wtexans&quot; &lt;wtexans@...&gt;","profile":"wtexans","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: lethargy?","postDate":"1292045492","msgId":58428,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlkdjJiaytmZWcxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlkcWtoYSs5YTVlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58423,"nextInTopic":58429,"prevInTime":58427,"nextInTime":58429,"topicId":58415,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"===i think as well, at the moment we have financial difficulties and i feel like what i am doing at home is not contributing in any way to our situation=== ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1036315991\">===i think as well, at the moment we have financial difficulties and i feel like what i am doing at home is not contributing in any way to our situation===<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you do may not generate income, but it contributes in that it eliminates expenses that would exist if you held a job outside the home.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose kind of expenses would vary from family to family, but could include: childcare, work clothes / uniforms, dry cleaning, increased vehicle expenses, increased cost of meals if fast food / eating out happened more often because of both parents not having the energy to cook, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there are the things that don&#39;t have a monetary value, most especially you being available for your kiddos in a way that would be much more challenging (and exhausting) if you weren&#39;t home with them the way you are now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know when finances are tight it&#39;s hard to see a perspective other than &quot;we&#39;re scraping by and I&#39;m not contributing financially&quot;, so it can help to shift your perspective and think about the ways your family&#39;s expenses are decreased by you being at home, and to also think about how your availability to your kiddos might change if you were working outside the home. <br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] lethargy?","postDate":"1291998529","msgId":58423,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFDQUQ3QTA5LTYyODItNENFNS05ODgwLTQwMjBBNkE4RDU1RUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlkcWtoYSs5YTVlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlkcWtoYSs5YTVlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58422,"nextInTopic":58428,"prevInTime":58422,"nextInTime":58424,"topicId":58415,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-BUT what else am i needed for? i feel like i am getting lazy and lethargic, as to be honest i am finding it soooo easy and chilled and feel it should not","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1025335611\">-=-BUT what else am i needed for? i feel like i am getting lazy and<br/>\nlethargic, as to be honest i am finding it soooo easy and chilled and feel it<br/>\nshould not be, as most people find their &quot;work&quot; hard and tedious. should i just<br/>\ncount my blessings that i am doing something i love and the children are not<br/>\ncomplaining so they are obviuosly ok?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dark part is that lethargy could be depression.  If it is, go with cheery, happy, breathe, sky, smile kind of stuff (or if it&#39;s advanced, counselling).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe light and breezy part is that you might just have come to the point that your children can wipe their own butts and put on their own shoes and coats, and you don&#39;t recognize the feeling.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember when your kids were all little and touching you and needing to be carried and hanging on you and unable to put their own clothes on?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe what you&#39;re seeing is the contrast to those days, and feeling that you used to be crucial (and overburdened) and now you&#39;re at a loss for how to fill that stress level.   But it&#39;s okay not to be stressed.  Recovery from that many years of overwhelmedness can take a while to get over!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have that feeling too, lots of times, that my movements and time expenditure aren&#39;t &quot;having something to show for it.&quot;  I write.  That shows here and on my blogs but not in the bathroom at my house, where I need to put in a clean mat and clean that little bit of mold off the ceiling, and mop the floor.   I *could* fixate on the bathroom and make myself feel guilty, but I don&#39;t.  And when I&#39;m feeling lazy and want to go to sleep early, I try to force myself to &quot;do something productive,&quot; but my nice husband says resting and having some time to be still IS productive, and healing.  And he&#39;s right.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo try to give yourself the gift of acceptance that people can&#39;t be frantically busy every day all day (and still stay heathly) any more than a person can be awake 24 hours a day for weeks without sleeping (or even for days).  Sleep is natural.  Feeling the need to be still and quiet is natural too, and mothers with babies hardly ever get to be still and quiet.  It&#39;s your time and you&#39;ve earned it.  It will come and go.<br/>\n<br/>\nCulture tells us to do, do more, do better, impress the neighbors, dazzle the relatives.<br/>\nMental health needs some quiet time for thoughts to come in on their own, and although I don&#39;t know all the details, my thought is that if you think of it as cocooning instead of lethargy, you&#39;ll feel better immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: lethargy?","postDate":"1291959409","msgId":58422,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGk9X2o3cDZDbzhQTUJqbm5lb21ZQXNodW9DMk5RTW00K3dDMlZLR0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlkcnJrZCsxa3JxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlkcWtoYSs5YTVlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8aWRycmtkKzFrcnFAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":58421,"nextInTopic":58423,"prevInTime":58421,"nextInTime":58423,"topicId":58415,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"One of the things that crop up for me is feeling, and even people saying, that I need to do something productive, preferably with results anyone can see.
