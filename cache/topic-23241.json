Commissioned jointly by a local theatre group <br/>\nand the Hamilton City Council, the statue stands on the site of the old Embassy <br/>\nCinema, where O&#39;Brien once watched science-fiction double features.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to have a photo of this, and if it&#39;s on a postcard that would be <br/>\nVERY cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith google I saw a photo of the plaque at the base of it (also cool) and <br/>\nread that it was made by WETA, who did the props and lots of special effects for <br/>\nthe Lord of the Rings movies.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI just came from living in New Zealand for 6 years 5 months ago. Never lived in Hamilton though and never heard of this statue. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou could search some generic NZ websites, the first that springs to mind is  www.nzcity.co.nz  .<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, WETA might have archives online- google it to find out<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a magazine, New Zealand Geographic- modeled on National Geographic but even better, we enjoyed them immensely while there) which also might have searchable archives.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the official websites of Hamilton City and Tourism New Zealand could provide some leads too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t have a photo or postcard of it to send you.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNicole<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Yahoo!
