Joy is stopping to get pizza and  <br/>\nhaving an impromptu picnic at the park, complete with feeding the  <br/>\ngeese. Joy is building most of a tree house. Joy is creating &#39;mud  <br/>\nworld&#39; when the pool gets boring, and not having mom freak out. Joy  <br/>\nis having the only backyard on the block that&#39;s not landscaped and  <br/>\ncan be dug up at will. Joy is making pirate flags and pretending to  <br/>\nbe the bad guy so Sam can win. Joy is seeing Emily ace her Tae kwon  <br/>\nDo test, and have the confidence and wisdom to reassure her (much  <br/>\nolder) classmates. Joy is teaching an unknown child how to knit while  <br/>\nat said class. Joy is winning the bid, on behalf of the kids, of an  <br/>\neight-foot 3D Narnia cardboard wardrobe. Not to mention transporting  <br/>\nit home and setting it up in the dining room because there is no  <br/>\nother place it will fit. Today has been (in the immortal wisdom of  <br/>\nBill and Ted) &#39;a most excellent day&#39;. Joy is staying up late after  <br/>\nthe kids are asleep to clean up all the happy messes from the day,  <br/>\nand strew some fun for tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy old tapes are getting worn out. That&#39;s my joy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (8), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (4), Dan  <br/>\n(2), and Avari Rose</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24666,"nextTopicId":24676}}
