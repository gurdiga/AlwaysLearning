No amount of<br/>\nreassurance that Clara Davis studies in the 1930&#39;s showed kids will go on<br/>\nfood jags, but eat a balanced diet if one does a long term study.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids happily eating grapefruit and using cutlery as two year olds always<br/>\nbrought questions of &quot;how&quot;?  The explanation was always greeted with<br/>\ndisbelief, generally based on the idea that treating your child respectfully<br/>\nand as a partner in the eating venture was starting parenting off on the<br/>\nwrong foot.  Their perspective stemmed from an idea that one needs to<br/>\nestablish control early and that a lack of discipline or control at this<br/>\nstage meant more trouble ahead.  Expert books on childrearing and nutrition<br/>\nwere certainly creating more fear than helping people.  There is no secret<br/>\nto eating, really.  Mostly, I eat when hungry, around my kids, who<br/>\noccasionally share my food.  Other times they eat something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nI discovered Ruby Red Grapefruits as an adult and bought a bag of ones on<br/>\nsale as a loss leader one day to have as a quick C-filled snack.  Rowan, as<br/>\na one year old, noticed how much I enjoyed this food and how abundant it<br/>\nseemed to be, yet I was offering him apple, avocado and banana.  Quickly, he<br/>\nmade it known he wanted a grapefruit.  I hesitated thinking he wouldn&#39;t like<br/>\nit, but figured he might enjoy playing with it.  This simple act of trust,<br/>\novercoming my bias that kids didn&#39;t like grapefruit, gave Rowan the<br/>\nopportunity to discover one of his favourite foods. He began enjoying them<br/>\nin earnest.  As his world broadened he began making other food choices,<br/>\nalways wanting to try things others were eating: oreos, jello, or<br/>\nstarfruits.  At first I agonized over the junkfood.  But soon I was<br/>\nfollowing a motto of &quot;not refusing&quot;.  I offered the protein and vitamin<br/>\nenriched foods first, but never worried about the others.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy other sons were quite similar.  I never strapped my children to high<br/>\nchairs and spoon-fed them.  We discovered food.  As soon as they could sit<br/>\nupright we went on picnics--eating on cloths spread on the ground or floor.<br/>\n<br/>\nFocus on candles, colour and table setting.  Make food fun, and forget what<br/>\nthe child is eating.  Eat what you like, and eat what they like and focus on<br/>\nenjoying one another&#39;s company.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the last few years Martin(10) has lived off meat and what most parents<br/>\ncall &quot;junkfood&quot;.  But he loves carrot juice and fruit.  Lettuce is<br/>\noverrated--its not exactly a powerhouse of vitamins, minerals or protein.<br/>\nThe only time he eats it is on his burger.  The others will eat lettuce,<br/>\nexcept with dressing in salad guise.  They eat handfuls while I prepare the<br/>\nsalad.  I used to make extra large ones, convinced the kids would eat the<br/>\nwhole thing and fight over the last scraps.  But they never touched the<br/>\nsalad--though they ate the veggies off the cutting board with obvious<br/>\nrelish.  I have found my kids love crudite plates, and often I&#39;m the only<br/>\none eating the dip:)  Who would have thought raw  undressed purple cabbage<br/>\nwould be a kid fav?<br/>\n<br/>\nMarina<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Reply to sender&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a>?subject=Re:+%5BAlwaysLearning%5D+Food+Issues&gt;| Reply<br/>\n&gt; to group&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>?subject=Re:+%5BAlwaysLearning%5D+Food+Issues&gt;| Reply<br/>\n&gt; via web post&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/post;_ylc=X3oDMTJxMjFhY2hzBF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzQ0MTAyNTAEZ3Jwc3BJZAMxNzA1NTQyMTExBG1zZ0lkAzU0NTgxBHNlYwNmdHIEc2xrA3JwbHkEc3RpbWUDMTI3NTYyNzQ4OA--?act=reply&messageNum=54581\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/post;_ylc=X3oDMTJxMjFhY2hzBF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzQ0MTAyNTAEZ3Jwc3BJZAMxNzA1NTQyMTExBG1zZ0lkAzU0NTgxBHNlYwNmdHIEc2xrA3JwbHkEc3RpbWUDMTI3NTYyNzQ4OA--?act=reply&messageNum=54581</a>&gt;| Start<br/>\n&gt; a New Topic&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/post;_ylc=X3oDMTJlcGVrMWVvBF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzQ0MTAyNTAEZ3Jwc3BJZAMxNzA1NTQyMTExBHNlYwNmdHIEc2xrA250cGMEc3RpbWUDMTI3NTYyNzQ4OA--\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/post;_ylc=X3oDMTJlcGVrMWVvBF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzQ0MTAyNTAEZ3Jwc3BJZAMxNzA1NTQyMTExBHNlYwNmdHIEc2xrA250cGMEc3RpbWUDMTI3NTYyNzQ4OA--</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Messages in this topic&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/message/54498;_ylc=X3oDMTM2MTBqazd2BF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzQ0MTAyNTAEZ3Jwc3BJZAMxNzA1NTQyMTExBG1zZ0lkAzU0NTgxBHNlYwNmdHIEc2xrA3Z0cGMEc3RpbWUDMTI3NTYyNzQ4OAR0cGNJZAM1NDQ5OA--\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/message/54498;_ylc=X3oDMTM2MTBqazd2BF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzQ0MTAyNTAEZ3Jwc3BJZAMxNzA1NTQyMTExBG1zZ0lkAzU0NTgxBHNlYwNmdHIEc2xrA3Z0cGMEc3RpbWUDMTI3NTYyNzQ4OAR0cGNJZAM1NDQ5OA--</a>&gt;(<br/>\n&gt; 18)<br/>\n&gt;  Recent Activity:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    - New Members&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/members;_ylc=X3oDMTJmZXFwMTRqBF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzQ0MTAyNTAEZ3Jwc3BJZAMxNzA1NTQyMTExBHNlYwN2dGwEc2xrA3ZtYnJzBHN0aW1lAzEyNzU2Mjc0ODc-?o=6\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/members;_ylc=X3oDMTJmZXFwMTRqBF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzQ0MTAyNTAEZ3Jwc3BJZAMxNzA1NTQyMTExBHNlYwN2dGwEc2xrA3ZtYnJzBHN0aW1lAzEyNzU2Mjc0ODc-?o=6</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    14<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Visit Your Group&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning;_ylc=X3oDMTJla3RtM3NnBF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzQ0MTAyNTAEZ3Jwc3BJZAMxNzA1NTQyMTExBHNlYwN2dGwEc2xrA3ZnaHAEc3RpbWUDMTI3NTYyNzQ4Nw--\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning;_ylc=X3oDMTJla3RtM3NnBF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzQ0MTAyNTAEZ3Jwc3BJZAMxNzA1NTQyMTExBHNlYwN2dGwEc2xrA3ZnaHAEc3RpbWUDMTI3NTYyNzQ4Nw--</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  MARKETPLACE<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Stay on top of your group activity without leaving the page you&#39;re on - Get<br/>\n&gt; the Yahoo!

I was a super-picky eater as a child and my life was made miserable for it (I was heckled and ridiculed at every meal). Most vegetables have always triggered my gag reflex; they still do.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I watch Eric and one thing that is going on for him is that he is _disgusted_ by a food he doesn&#39;t like being in his mouth. He told his dad recently that he just doesn&#39;t know what to do with food in his mouth if he doesn&#39;t like it.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarl, on the other hand, can try a food he doesn&#39;t like and he&#39;ll chew it up and swallow it and then go, &quot;huh, I didn&#39;t like that,&quot; shrug and move on.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo one thing that is true is that trying a new food is a riskier, higher-stakes prospect for Eric than it is for Carl. I think Carl would do OK in a house with a &quot;two bites&quot; rule or something like that. It would be torment for Eric. Like me, Eric is also very wary of food if he doesn&#39;t know exactly what it is and what&#39;s in it, because getting an unexpected bite of something distasteful is revolting, nauseating, distressing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes there is no &quot;now&quot; solution to a challenge with a kid. Yes, it&#39;s a problem if a kid is having problems of some kind because of not eating enough protein. But it&#39;s not always possible to get more protein into that kid without pressuring, nagging, demanding--and turning food into something stressful for everybody. As I&#39;ve gotten older, I understand that some of my food aversions just seem to be in-born, but I also know that the constant stress and conflict I was subjected to as a child made things much worse. One of our goals for Eric has been to keep eating relaxed and easy for him. So we do invite him to try new things, and if he says no, we just say, &quot;OK, maybe another time.&quot; We noticed when he was younger that Eric would often turn down a new food by saying that he didn&#39;t want it &quot;right now&quot; or that maybe he would like it when he got older, holding open that possibility that he would eat it someday.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember bringing some problem I was having with 5 or 6-year-old Eric to one of the unschooling lists and getting good ideas, but also having a couple of people say that in their experience the thing that helped most was just their kid eventually getting older, and that has certainly been true for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou mentioned that wrt to the chips, you do have budget constraints. Sometimes my kids respond well to the game of giving things in fantasy you can&#39;t give in reality: &quot;I wish I could take you for chips right now! I wish that I could buy you all the chips you wanted! So many that they wouldn&#39;t all fit in the car! We&#39;d have to rent a trailer just to bring them home! No...I wish we could just have a KFC installed in the kitchen, and a person who worked there and whenever we wanted chips we&#39;d just say, more chips! and they&#39;d make them for us!&quot; They like the humor and they like me affirming that I really would say Yes if I could, and that I say Yes as much as I can.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu, mom to Eric, 9; Carl, 6; Yehva, 2.5<br/>\ntapeflags.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279647515,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"&quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;d.lewis@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Food Issues","postDate":"1275568799","msgId":54531,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg1NjcxRUIyMDdGOTQyQzk4QjM5QkUxOUI1OTNCOTQ4QGRlYm9yYWg0M2YxM2ZkPg==","referencesHeader":"PDY4OTYxNjFELTdBNjUtNDcxNy04NzI0LTlCRjY0MTMwQTk3M0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDVDQThFQjI3RENDNTQ0RTNBN0JBQTNBQ0U1QzA1RTcxQHRhbWFyYT4gPEU5QkUxM0YwLTIzQ0ItNDMxOC05MDNCLThBRDIwOUEwQjFDQUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPEUyQ0ZCMzA0Qjg5MzQwQkRCRjRBQjk5M0JFMUJBMEE3QHRhbWFyYT4="},"prevInTopic":54530,"nextInTopic":54535,"prevInTime":54530,"nextInTime":54532,"topicId":54498,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Trouble is, while she will happily eat meat, she won t eat most of the other protien sources*** Pam Sorooshian gave a recipe once for peanut butter goodies,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1944023252\">***Trouble is, while she will happily eat meat, she won&#39;t eat most of the other protien sources***<br/>\n<br/>\nPam Sorooshian gave a recipe once for peanut butter goodies, made from peanut butter, powdered milk and, I think, honey.

Trying new things made me gag, anything with the wrong texture and I&#39;d be in real trouble with the whole experience. My parents were really disturbed by my limited diet. They would keep me at the table, they would do the just one bite of this and you can have something you like things, they would require I try something before refusing to eat it. I would lie about having tried food before at someone else&#39;s home, usually my grandmother. Nothing worked. I just didn&#39;t like a wide variety of foods. And I was so uncomfortable with what was clearly a personal limitation, my own stubborness, my own unwillingness to just take what was offered, that I didn&#39;t want to travel much or eat at other people&#39;s homes. I wanted to stay where I knew my options. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can remember going to a vegetarian restaurant, the only one in Omaha, I don&#39;t think it lasted long and ordering a burger. I figured that was safe. It was so awful. I don&#39;t think I ate and that embarrassed my parents. They wanted me to appreciate the new experience, but it was full of onions and other vegetables and it wasn&#39;t anything like a burger. It was false advertising in my mind. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I married David he was a vegetarian and we ate fairly distinct meals. He never pressed me to eat something he liked or he cooked, even. He just let me be comfortable with my diet. Over time he began to offer me food, nothing that pushed my clear no go foods, nothing that made me gag, nothing that made me nervous just looking at it. And the more I enjoyed of what he offered the more I trusted what he was next offering. We&#39;ve been married for 13 years now and I&#39;ve had people call me a gastronome. I am fairly willing to try new things, although at times the old me will block the experience, at least for a few moments. I love the whole experience of food and look to travelling as a way to try variations on the theme. Having David slowly widen my comfort zone has got me to a place where I am really willing to expand my comfort zone. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and the concept of cheesecake disturbed me to no end when I was a child. My brother had one for his birthday and I wouldn&#39;t even try it. I was amazed the first time I had it by what it was given what I had envisioned. <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t push, really back off and let her eat what she is comfortable with. If you have something you thing she might like, offer it, but be so willing and comfortable with a no answer that a yes almost blows you over. Over time she may come to trust your recommendations if you give trustworthy ones. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, with the not trying new food, I mean she really won&#39;t try it at all. <br/>\nShe won&#39;t even put it in her mouth with the offer that she can spit it out <br/>\nif she doesn&#39;t like it, and frequently will reject a whole plate of food if <br/>\nthere is anything unfamilliar on it.

She won&#39;t eat dips of any kind, or <br/>\npretty much anything that is mixed with anything else, so no soups, stews, <br/>\nspaghetti etc.  It is very frustrating, as DH and I eat a lot of these <br/>\nfoods.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu Penn said:<br/>\n-=So, in your situation, unless there was a really compelling reason not to <br/>\n(the nearest KFC is a two-hour drive away, or the family budget is <br/>\nsuper-tight just now), I would, for awhile, take her to KFC every day, buy <br/>\nher as many chips as she wanted, enjoy watching her enjoy them, say cheerful <br/>\npositive things like, &quot;you really like those chips. They&#39;re good, aren&#39;t <br/>\nthey? We can come again tomorrow if you want. We can come again later today <br/>\nif you want!&quot; as appropriate, and see what I could do to fill up her desire <br/>\nfor those potatoes, trusting that, most likely, once she really feels like <br/>\nshe&#39;s had enough of them, they won&#39;t loom so large for her, and they&#39;ll <br/>\nbecome just another food she likes instead of The Food She Must Have Or <br/>\nElse.=-<br/>\n<br/>\nReally good advice, and thanks so much for telling me your story, it really <br/>\ndoes help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see that I need to relax the restrictions even further, but the other <br/>\nissue is that we do really have some budgetting concerns right now.  Not to <br/>\ngo into it, but we are living on savings while I get my home business off <br/>\nthe ground, so DH and I are starting to get a little concerned about money <br/>\nas things get a little tighter.<br/>\n<br/>\nJenny Cyphers said:<br/>\n-=One of my kids did that. We never really restricted food, so it wasn&#39;t <br/>\nreactionary, but she did get really selective about what she was eating. I <br/>\nwatched it and it was uncomfortable for me because I worried. What she did, <br/>\nin hindsight I can see it and Schuyler helped point it out, was that she was <br/>\ngiving her body a clean slate to work with. She found out through that <br/>\nprocess that she couldn&#39;t eat eggs at all, something that I made for her all <br/>\nthe time. It caused her stomach pain but she liked them and never made the <br/>\nconnection, but because of the pain she stopped eating other things and <br/>\neventually found the connection. It wasn&#39;t something that she did <br/>\nconsciously, but that is what came out of it.=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has been one of my concerns, and one of the reasons I have tried to let <br/>\nher choose her own foods (and respected her choice not to eat eggs or drink <br/>\nmilk).  As I mentioned, she was mildly lactose intollerant as a baby, though <br/>\nshe seems to be able to drink milk without any ill effects now.  DH is also <br/>\ngluten intollerant, so there are other food issues that run in the family.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, with the not trying new food, I mean she really won&#39;t try it at all. <br/>\nShe won&#39;t even put it in her mouth with the offer that she can spit it out <br/>\nif she doesn&#39;t like it, and frequently will reject a whole plate of food if <br/>\nthere is anything unfamilliar on it.  She won&#39;t even try things like <br/>\ncheesecake, or other sweets, much less anything like a new vegetable.  Fruit <br/>\nshe is surprisingly OK with, and will try new fruits sometimes (depending on <br/>\nthe fruit), and occasionally she will try a new meat.<br/>\n<br/>\nTamara</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Food Issues","postDate":"1275506820","msgId":54508,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI4MjQxMi4yNzY2Mi5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDYubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDVDQThFQjI3RENDNTQ0RTNBN0JBQTNBQ0U1QzA1RTcxQHRhbWFyYT4=","referencesHeader":"PDY4OTYxNjFELTdBNjUtNDcxNy04NzI0LTlCRjY0MTMwQTk3M0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDVDQThFQjI3RENDNTQ0RTNBN0JBQTNBQ0U1QzA1RTcxQHRhbWFyYT4="},"prevInTopic":54507,"nextInTopic":54523,"prevInTime":54507,"nextInTime":54509,"topicId":54498,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***My problem is that as I mentioned, she s always been very selective about what she eats, and since we ve stopped restricting food as much, she s actually","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1530162243\">***My problem is that as I mentioned, she&#39;s always been very selective <br/>\nabout<br/>\nwhat she eats, and since we&#39;ve stopped restricting food as much, she&#39;s<br/>\nactually started cutting out foods that she previously would eat,***<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my kids did that.

I&#39;ve had no issues<br/>\nwith it with TV or computer, but am struggling more with the food.  Ezri has<br/>\nbeen a really selective eater since she was really young, and we&#39;ve always<br/>\ntried to respect her choices, while encouraging her to try new foods.  We&#39;ve<br/>\nhad times of cutting out sweets/artificial colours etc, on advice that<br/>\nallergies must be causing some other issues, but I no longer believe that<br/>\n(not sure that I ever did, but I was desperate, wish I had found this list<br/>\nearlier).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem is that as I mentioned, she&#39;s always been very selective about<br/>\nwhat she eats, and since we&#39;ve stopped restricting food as much, she&#39;s<br/>\nactually started cutting out foods that she previously would eat, such as<br/>\nsandwiches (she&#39;d only ever have jam or plain bread), peanuts, some fruit<br/>\netc, and I&#39;m really starting to worry.  The biggest problem for me is that<br/>\nif she doesn&#39;t eat something filling early in the day, she becomes very<br/>\neasily upset.  She will eat fruit, but this doesn&#39;t seem to fill her up.<br/>\nShe will eat packets and packets of flavoured rice crackers (only two<br/>\nparticular flavours though, if we buy any others, she isn&#39;t interested), but<br/>\nwon&#39;t touch sandwiches like she used to.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe haven&#39;t had any problems with re-introducing sweets.  She&#39;ll eat a lot, <br/>\nthen when they run out, she&#39;s happy enough until we get the chance to buy <br/>\nsome more.    The problem we&#39;re having is with KFC chips, which she asks for <br/>\nconstantly.  She would eat them every day, which I am finding a little<br/>\nfrustrating.  Even if we offer to buy them tomorrow, when we&#39;re going out<br/>\nalready, or we&#39;ll cook chips at home, it doesn&#39;t seem to help.  She will <br/>\nhave a massive tantrum in which no answer is acceptable other than us saying <br/>\nthat we&#39;re going out to buy them right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this just an adjustment phase?  Is there any way to respectfully <br/>\nencourage her to eat more of a variety of foods?  Anyone who&#39;s been through <br/>\nsomething similar and come out the other end?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it helps any, she&#39;s nearly 6 (birthday is tomorrow), and has never been <br/>\nto school. (Though we did try school at home for all of a month.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nTamara<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":301108410,"authorName":"Marina DeLuca-Howard","from":"Marina DeLuca-Howard &lt;delucahoward@...&gt;","profile":"matedgirl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Food Issues","postDate":"1275506588","msgId":54507,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlsSXpSdEtSQ2lSX0RaS2dHM2w5aGlGeHFLYkw1V01jX3JpY0pCMEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDM2MzE1My40OTYucW1Ad2ViMTEwNDEzLm1haWwuZ3ExLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDY4OTYxNjFELTdBNjUtNDcxNy04NzI0LTlCRjY0MTMwQTk3M0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JPDVDQThFQjI3RENDNTQ0RTNBN0JBQTNBQ0U1QzA1RTcxQHRhbWFyYT4JPEU5QkUxM0YwLTIzQ0ItNDMxOC05MDNCLThBRDIwOUEwQjFDQUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JPDM2MzE1My40OTYucW1Ad2ViMTEwNDEzLm1haWwuZ3ExLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":54506,"nextInTopic":54508,"prevInTime":54506,"nextInTime":54508,"topicId":54498,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Rowan and I invented a dip for yam fries...yoghurt, cream cheese, ricotta with chives(should be creamy), and spices de Provence.

And then we&#39;d be out of pudding until the next week&#39;s grocery shopping.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt turned out, listening to what he said about it, that he felt worried that there wouldn&#39;t be enough for him, that other people would eat the pudding and he wouldn&#39;t get as much as he wanted. So he was pre-emptively eating piles of pudding.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I started buying just insane-seeming amounts of these pudding cups, and I told Eric, &quot;If we run out and you want more, I will take you to the store and we will buy more, no matter what day it is.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe went through a brief period of eating those pudding cups, oh my goodness, the pudding cups he ate. But pretty soon, starting to believe that I really intended for him to have as many as he wanted/needed, he tapered off. And within, oh, a few weeks probably, he was down to one or two a day, and then awhile after that I noticed that they were sitting around in the fridge uneaten, and after that they became something we bought from time to time if someone had a taste for them, or I noticed them in the store and thought they&#39;d be a nice treat.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in your situation, unless there was a really compelling reason not to (the nearest KFC is a two-hour drive away, or the family budget is super-tight just now), I would, for awhile, take her to KFC every day, buy her as many chips as she wanted, enjoy watching her enjoy them, say cheerful positive things like, &quot;you really like those chips. They&#39;re good, aren&#39;t they? We can come again tomorrow if you want. We can come again later today if you want!&quot; as appropriate, and see what I could do to fill up her desire for those potatoes, trusting that, most likely, once she really feels like she&#39;s had enough of them, they won&#39;t loom so large for her, and they&#39;ll become just another food she likes instead of The Food She Must Have Or Else.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is this just an adjustment phase?  Is there any way to respectfully <br/>\n&gt; encourage her to eat more of a variety of foods?  Anyone who&#39;s been through <br/>\n&gt; something similar and come out the other end?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know that there is an &quot;other end,&quot; but with Eric, who is very particular about what he eats, it is a great pleasure to see him, at 9, completely unconflicted and relaxed about food. Sometimes he chooses to try new things, sometimes he doesn&#39;t, but he does eat a wide enough variety to get what he needs and enjoy eating.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou also mentioned the protein problem. Eric sometimes also seems to need protein and not want to eat anything but carbohydrates. Mostly over the years we have dealt with this by offering protein in as many palatable forms as we could. Protein-y drinks like kefer and Carnation Instant Breakfast (a powder you mix with milk; it&#39;s chocolate but also has added vitamins and nutrients), for instance, have been really useful for us. (And by &quot;useful,&quot; I mean that I don&#39;t know how we&#39;d have gotten through the ages of 3 and 4 without kefir!)<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce in a great while, when he was younger and really showing signs of needing protein, I have been pretty firm on the protein issue, and have said something like, &quot;I know you really want to go to the zoo (or whatever), but I don&#39;t want to go with you when you&#39;re behaving like this. I think eating some protein might help. I&#39;m happy to help you think of ideas of what to eat, but you must eat something with protein before we go to the zoo.&quot; Sometimes that meant a CIB, sometimes it meant driving through McDonald&#39;s for a burger, or getting a milkshake at a place that uses real milk, or some sweet yogurt. I never &quot;put my foot down&quot; on the protein issue without _also_ offering as many options as I could think of, and being open to his suggestions as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Eric has gotten older, he can recognize in himself the signs of not having eaten soon enough and, if he needs help with ideas, will ask me for it. <br/>\n<br/>\nSu, mom to Eric, 9; Carl, 6; Yehva, 2.5<br/>\ntapeflags.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Food Issues","postDate":"1275482409","msgId":54501,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlrZFBsYy1IQlpYeTZHUVMtcE5jV0s1X0FQVFlIWEpzWHZneEVMZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDVDQThFQjI3RENDNTQ0RTNBN0JBQTNBQ0U1QzA1RTcxQHRhbWFyYT4=","referencesHeader":"PDY4OTYxNjFELTdBNjUtNDcxNy04NzI0LTlCRjY0MTMwQTk3M0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JPDVDQThFQjI3RENDNTQ0RTNBN0JBQTNBQ0U1QzA1RTcxQHRhbWFyYT4="},"prevInTopic":54499,"nextInTopic":54504,"prevInTime":54500,"nextInTime":54502,"topicId":54498,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Have you seen the studies on marginal utility which means that the scarcer something seems to be, the more valuable it s going to be to the person who feels/is","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-296017338\">Have you seen the studies on marginal utility which means that the scarcer<br/>\nsomething seems to be, the more valuable it&#39;s going to be to the person who<br/>\nfeels/is limited.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/t/economics\">http://sandradodd.com/t/economics</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThat thought helped me to be more reasonable about limits of any kind.
