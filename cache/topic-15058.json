She works for a GS <br/>\nCouncil, and constantly hears whining about Girl Scouts and how bad it is. (One <br/>\ntheme seems to be adults who boast with pride, &quot;I was kicked out of Girl Scouts!&quot; <br/>\nWe suspect their parents pulled them out because they were tired of getting <br/>\ncalls about how disruptive they are, then told them they were kicked out.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth will appreciate someone talking about the positives for a change.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I&#39;m thinking of it, I have a rant. Recently the Philadelphia area Boy <br/>\nScout council&#39;s board unanimously voted in a non-discrimination policy <br/>\n(including about sexual orientation). A long-time teenage Boy Scout then came out in a <br/>\nnewspaper interview...and was kicked out.
