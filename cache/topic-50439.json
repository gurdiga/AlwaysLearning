What does &quot;strong within&quot; mean?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, they are not just words. They are a culmination of three years of hard<br/>\ninner work that I have done on myself after life pushed me to a corner that<br/>\nhad no walls, no doors, no windows. So the only place to go was within,<br/>\nwhere I found murky streets, scary corners, ugly mirrors reflecting me,<br/>\nstorms and hurricanes. I walked alone through it all. Facing myself was the<br/>\nmost fearsome and difficult thing that I have done. But once I crossed over<br/>\nthe pain, I found love for myself, faith in me, unbound confidence in who I<br/>\nam and my true potential. With that love for all those who are connected<br/>\nwith me became easier and flowing. It became easier to say YES and also to<br/>\nsay NO.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce all this was over then practicing it all the time is the key to find<br/>\ninner strength. which simply means knowing from your bones that what we are<br/>\nis the way we were meant to be. No need to be apologetic or shameful for our<br/>\ntrue calling.<br/>\n<br/>\n Is it more &quot;gentle to<br/>\nothers&quot; to pat them on the back and say soothing things or to point out<br/>\nchoices they&#39;re making that might be problematic?<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, it simply means to be truthful and honest. No need to fight or get<br/>\nupset. As long as the choices of others affect our lives, it matters. If it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t affect us directly or indirectly, it is not problematic at all. But<br/>\ncan you see how important it is to know what really matters and what does<br/>\nnot. Discriminating consciously and in a wakeful way is a constant<br/>\npractice.<br/>\n<br/>\nDola<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Sun, Sep 19, 2010 at 11:14 AM, Pam Sorooshian<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would warn to be very careful about platitudes....writing or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reading, giving or receiving<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;A trite or banal remark or statement, especially one expressed as if it<br/>\n&gt; were original or significant.&quot; (online dictionary)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Platitudes are like astrology or fortune telling - people can interpret<br/>\n&gt; them as it suits them and they can seem like support for &quot;whatever.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; People can use them as a catalyst for their own thinking - but people<br/>\n&gt; can use fortune cookies for that, too.

If you have memories of  <br/>\nchildhood, examine them objectively sometimes when you&#39;re considering  <br/>\nhow to be with your own children.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere might be things from your past that you would do just as your  <br/>\nparents did, and by doing that you would honor the happiness you  <br/>\nremember from childhood.  That&#39;s a way to show gratitude to your  <br/>\nparents even if they&#39;re not living anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere might be things you remember that you would not want to pass on  <br/>\nto your children.  For me, being put to bed alone in a dark room is  <br/>\nnot something healing for me or for my children.  When I let them have  <br/>\na light, or let them sleep with me and their dad or wherever they want  <br/>\nto, I imagine peacefully how nice that would have been for me, as a  <br/>\nchild, and that soothes and heals my soul.  I still have the memories,  <br/>\nbut they&#39;re not as scary.  They don&#39;t trigger resentment now, but  <br/>\nnicer emotions, because now they&#39;re about my own children.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe list of things that marred your childhood can be your checklist of  <br/>\nthings to avoid or change or undo.  The things that brought joy to you  <br/>\nas a child can be things for you to do for and with your children,  <br/>\ntoo, if you can.<br/>\n<br/>\nKnowing some of my husband&#39;s childhood hurts helped too.

That didn&#39;t happen because of unschooling, it happened  <br/>\nbecause of breastfeeding my first baby.  I was doing something  <br/>\nprofoundly right, and it was deeply bonding for us.  I had nursed the  <br/>\nsecond baby and was pregnant with the third when we started  <br/>\nunschooling.  It seemed the logical extension of the attachment  <br/>\nparenting that had made me feel so confident as a parent, and so good  <br/>\nabout myself from that present day back to my earliest memories.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I soothe my child, I soothe myself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://SandraDodd.com/parentingpeacefully\">http://SandraDodd.com/parentingpeacefully</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":294520986,"authorName":"Joanna","from":"&quot;Joanna&quot; &lt;ridingmom@...&gt;","profile":"ridingmom1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re:Issues with our mothers","postDate":"1265348017","msgId":50468,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhrZ2FqaCtoODY4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhrZ2EwbCtwbGNxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":50467,"nextInTopic":50470,"prevInTime":50467,"nextInTime":50469,"topicId":50439,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

You have no choice right now but to play out the same mother-child relationship you&#39;ve always played out.  You are the peace-keeper.  You, as an adult, have choices, but you have to claim them.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;I get confused cos my mum is still a source of frustration and anger in my<br/>\n&gt; life ­ she accuses me of holding onto anger from my childhood sometimes, but<br/>\n&gt; I am usually angry/annoyed at her for stuff she is doing right now&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Her suggestion that you are holding onto stuff from the past is a smokescreen.  She has likely figured out, probably intuitively, that she can stump you if she plays that card.  In other words, she gets you thinking about how there is something wrong with you and then you allow her to be mean to you in the present.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was in my late teens and early 20&#39;s my mother would play the &quot;you&#39;re selfish&quot; card if she felt less powerful.  It would always cause me to back off and do what she wanted.  Then I figured out it was a game, in the sense that it was about manipulation--not a genuine, unbiased assessment that I was actually selfish.  In fact, I was far from it.  I stopped reacting to it, and lo and behold she maybe tried it twice after that and never said it again.  <br/>\n<br/>\n­ &quot;if I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; think about stuff from the past it does piss me off, although I can sigh and<br/>\n&gt; know she just did what she thought was right with the info and resources she<br/>\n&gt; had at the time, but she continually impresses upon me how I parent totally<br/>\n&gt; wrong,&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why would you allow that kind of conversation?  (Don&#39;t answer, just ask yourself.  It&#39;s a clue that something&#39;s not &quot;right&quot;)  If I came to your door, befriended you, and then criticized your parenting, I&#39;ll bet you&#39;d know what to say to me.  You need some boundaries!  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut then she&#39;ll likely play the &quot;you&#39;re a bad daughter for being disrespectful&quot; card.  But you can see it coming.<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;And when she harps<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; on about my parenting&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just smile and change the subject.  Literally.  Ask her if she&#39;s going to see The Lightning Thief when it opens--if she&#39;d like to go with the kids.  Make it obvious that you don&#39;t want to talk about that.  There is no law saying that your companion gets to talk about whatever they want whether you like it or not.  Even if it&#39;s your mother.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;it does make me feel like telling her that when she<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; becomes the perfect mother she can come and give me lectures then but until<br/>\n&gt; then just STOP!!!!  Of course I don¹t say this cos it would seem cruel&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are choices that aren&#39;t either cruel OR &quot;keeping the peace.&quot;  Of course, it will mean a shift in the fundamental relationship, and that&#39;s the reason that many adult children will NOT take this step in healing.  Healing means change, and change feels scary. That&#39;s why we don&#39;t do it more often.  You need to be able to LET the relationship change--and it won&#39;t feel the same, but if your mother wants to have one with you, she&#39;ll start meeting you half way, instead of insisting it be on her terms.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have been the peace-keeper for someone who doesn&#39;t have control over her own emotions.  But you don&#39;t need to continue that role.  But you also can&#39;t wait for your mother to change things.  She won&#39;t change without YOU making the first move.  You&#39;ve been waiting for HER to grow up--expecting her to be the adult, the parent.  But now you are a parent and you can claim the right to peace for yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n­ &quot;I just try and um and ar as she lectures just to keep the peace ­ when I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; challenge her she starts shouting and accusing and I end up feeling like it<br/>\n&gt; really is all my fault and I am insane and need to go see a psychiatrist of<br/>\n&gt; something ­ last time she was shouting so loud she woke the baby up, so<br/>\n&gt; mainly I just try to gloss over things with her.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ask her calmly, politely and kindly to leave, since this is too disruptive for the children.

It&#39;s my  <br/>\nwriting, to the end (pages 16-17)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlain old Fear:  Some of the fears people have felt and reported are  <br/>\nfear of &quot;the truant officer,&quot; the principal, the police, social  <br/>\nservices, the neighbors, their own parents and other relatives.    <br/>\nAnother set of fears are that the children will never leave home, that  <br/>\nthey will never get a job, that they couldn�t get into college if they  <br/>\nwanted to.  The way to overcome the first set is to be circumspect and  <br/>\npolite and helpful.  Stay out of trouble.  The way to deal with the  <br/>\nsecond set is to meet some unschoolers, or at least find a place where  <br/>\nyou can read about them as they&#39;re growing up, those who are older  <br/>\nthan your own children.  If possible, find locals to hang out with, or  <br/>\nattend a conference or two.<br/>\n<br/>\nNew unschoolers are often afraid.  If you feel fear, that&#39;s natural.   <br/>\nIf you&#39;ve taken a child out of school, there is still a school there  <br/>\nyou could put him back into, so if your fear is that it&#39;s a once and  <br/>\nforever decision, it&#39;s not.  Schools are right there, still.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you feel that you&#39;re turning your back on your entire culture, take  <br/>\na deep breath and note that when you turn your back on school, all  <br/>\nthat&#39;s behind you is a school.  What&#39;s not school is infinite.  What  <br/>\nis school is small.<br/>\n<br/>\nFear of rejection by all your relatives can be frightening.  Think of  <br/>\nworst case scenarios.  If these people have been controlling you with  <br/>\nthreats and shame for twenty or thirty years, do you owe them another  <br/>\nthirty years?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been accused of encouraging parents to separate children from  <br/>\ntheir grandparents.  I know why some grandparents would have said  <br/>\nthat.  And the tone with which I was approached was very familiar to  <br/>\nme, too.  It was along the lines of &quot;Who do you think you are, little  <br/>\nmissy?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah.  It wasn&#39;t even my mom, mother-in-law or grandmother!  But it  <br/>\nwas someone&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want children separated from their parents or grandparents.  I  <br/>\nwant the parents and grandparents to be kind and generous to the  <br/>\nchildren.  I want parents to be kind and gentle with their children  <br/>\neven if the children are 25 or 45 years old.  I&#39;m old enough now that  <br/>\nany parent of any age who wants to explain to me how it is in the real  <br/>\nworld can back down and hush.  I&#39;m not theorizing and I&#39;m not being  <br/>\nreactionary.  I&#39;m making conscious choices and helping others see the  <br/>\npossibility of doing so as well, for the sake of their relationships  <br/>\nwith their children and partners, friends and parents.  Choices,  <br/>\nthough; not just choosing to continue to be told what to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool has become so much a part of life in the past few decades that  <br/>\nit seems to some that taking their children out of school is like  <br/>\nleaving the planet altogether.  You will be relieved, then, to  <br/>\ndiscover that school takes kids out of the world but unschooling gives  <br/>\nit back.  I know it can sound wrong and crazy.  Keep reading.  Keep  <br/>\nwatching your kids.

I don&#39;t ever want my kids to go through this, ever!  I see this all around me, it is the standard way in which parents treat and behave towards teenagers.  Teens come into their own minds and bodies, have their own ideas and perceptions of the world.  Kids do too, but the awareness changes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuddenly parents who once had little kids they could easily manipulate and control, who they had great power over, have kids that want to manipulate and control their own worlds, they want their own power.  From that point onward, it seems, it is a power struggle that someone will lose.  People are meant to find themselves and the power within themselves, it&#39;s a huge part of puberty.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur culture, in general, does a huge amount of damage to young people this way, controlling, manipulating, and infantilizing them.  What I want as a parent, and what my children want, shouldn&#39;t be at odds with each other.  Parents should exist to give their children a lift up to see the from a better place.  If I&#39;m controlling, manipulating, and infantilizing my almost grown child, I can&#39;t really lift her up, nor would she let me, I would be an obstacle for  her.  This gets played out in all kinds of households and schools help by keeping powerful young minds at bay, when they really want to just get out and sail the world.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re:Issues with our mothers","postDate":"1265314174","msgId":50462,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU5NDMxLjI5OTk5LnFtQHdlYjExMDQxMy5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PEM3OTA4MjNBLjQ5NUEla2F6emFyYXRAYmx1ZXlvbmRlci5jby51az4=","referencesHeader":"PEM3OTA4MjNBLjQ5NUEla2F6emFyYXRAYmx1ZXlvbmRlci5jby51az4="},"prevInTopic":50459,"nextInTopic":50463,"prevInTime":50461,"nextInTime":50463,"topicId":50439,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***And when she harps on about my parenting it does make me feel like telling her that when she becomes the perfect mother she can come and give me lectures","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1927994757\">***And when she harps<br/>\non about my parenting it does make me feel like telling her that when she<br/>\nbecomes the perfect mother she can come and give me lectures then but until<br/>\nthen just STOP!!!! ***<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could put it in writing maybe, instead of the heat of the moment.

I¹ve been to counselling in the past and am very aware of the ways in which I do not want to repeat my mothers parenting but how do you actually heal old hurts and how do you know when they are healed?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For me, I had to acknowledge my childhood for what it was rather than trying to make it better or worse in my head. It is in the past and there is nothing that I can do to change it. I had to realize that there was no sense in beating myself up over something that I had no control over. I was a kid. It is the adult&#39;s responsibility to take care of the kids rather than the other way around. Trying to assign blame and untangle all of the emotions was killing me inside. Perhaps that is oversimplified but it boils down to acknowledging it and moving on. I feel like I will never be completely healed because those pains are still very much there but I have chosen to not let them control me. I have been working hard to become indifferent towards the pain in my childhood because I will never be happy about it and being mad about it wasn&#39;t helping either. I think I will be healed when I can be indifferent about it all the time. That hasn&#39;t happened so there is still a lot of work to do. I constantly remind myself to be careful about what I hate and to be careful about getting to knotted up over it. If I want to be different, I have to look at my childhood objectively and see it for the good and the bad. The more knotted up I was, the harder it was for me to be the parent that I wanted to be. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I get confused cos my mum is still a source of frustration and anger in my life &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I felt that way too until I realized that it was a matter of choice. I can have my mother in my life and be frustrated and angry or I can cut her out. I didn&#39;t like either of those choices so I tried to figure out a way to still have her in my life without getting so frustrated and angry. I had to apply some of the unschooling principles that I had learned and read about to my relationship with my mother. I had to accept her for who she is rather than continually getting frustrated and angry because of who she isn&#39;t. She has been the same person since I was a kid. There has been very little variation over the years. Why would she suddenly change? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;&gt;she accuses me of holding onto anger from my childhood sometimes&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is there a chance that she is right? I know I wasn&#39;t able to move away from the current anger until I let go of the past anger. I think I kept holding on to that anger because it was what I knew. If I let that anger go, then I wouldn&#39;t have an excuse to be mad at the world or my mom or anyone else. I was using the anger from my childhood as a crutch. The hardest thing for me to admit was that I was still getting something out of it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I am usually angry/annoyed at her for stuff she is doing right now&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Then don&#39;t talk to her right now. When I find myself getting annoyed with everything that my mother says and does, I know it is time for me to take a break from my mom. If she calls, I don&#39;t answer the phone or tell her I am busy. I am an adult and I don&#39;t need people in my life that routinely annoy me and make me angry. When I am annoyed and angry, I find myself not doing better. I find myself slipping back into the patterns that I was raised with. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;but she continually impresses upon me how I parent totally<br/>\n </span></blockquote>wrong&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI had to set boundaries with my mother and my mother in law. If they want to question what I am doing because they genuinely want to understand my perspective, that is fine. If they want to tell me that what I am doing is wrong, I shut the conversation down. It took me quite a while to figure out how to do that. I would always feel so guilty afterward. Then, I realized that I deserved better and the only way that I was going to get that was to stand up for myself. I spent my life hoping that my mom would stand up for me and protect me but she never did. From her perspective, she did. From my perspective, her standing up and protecting me were a complete joke. If I wanted somebody to stand up for me, I had to do it for myself. I had to find power within myself. Nobody else could give that to me. It is something that I had to find within myself. It&#39;s really weird because once I find my own personal power I was able to let go of a lot of controlling behavior. So, when my mom starts lecturing me or control me in subtle ways, I remind myself that she has no personal power and is trying to find it by controlling people and things around her. <br/>\n<br/>\nI realized that I didn&#39;t care whether or not my mother (or mother in law) liked my parenting style. I had to ask myself, &quot;Why is her opinion so important?&quot; If she was a stranger on the street, I wouldn&#39;t think much about it. Since it is my mother, I felt like I needed her approval. I had an epiphany one day and realized that my need to have her approve of me comes from growing up with an external locus of control. I spent my entire life hearing that we should look to our elders for approval because they are supposed to have all the answers and know more. Moving from an external focus to an internal one doesn&#39;t happen overnight. It is not easy to overcome a lifetime of messages that reinforce the adult centered paradigm. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;And when she harps on about my parenting it does make me feel like telling her that when she<br/>\n </span></blockquote>becomes the perfect mother she can come and give me lectures then but until<br/>\nthen just STOP!!!!

The only time I ever listen to my mom to keep the peace is when I am physically at her house. If she does that stuff to me at her house, I leave. Why challenge her if you already know what the outcome is going to be? I learned to walk away and disengage. Every now and then I feel a little argumentative and actually engage but those times are finally starting to decrease. I knew what I needed to but just could not seem to do it successfully because I was at least getting some attention from her when she was giving me a lecture or going on about my siblings or somebody else that she currently hates. I don&#39;t want my kids to see that kind of crap. It used to infuriate me when my mother would start complaining about another family member when the kids were around. I finally had to tell her that it was not acceptable. I refuse to deliberately subject my kids to that crap. She finally figured out that I was serious because I would cut her off the minute she would start in on me. I would tell her, &quot;I don&#39;t want to hear it.&quot; In the beginning, she would persist but then realized that I meant business because I would leave, get off the phone, or find another way to get the hell out of that situation. In the beginning when I was trying to figure out how to disengage, I would literally hang up on her. I had tried to be understanding and forgiving but I think ultimately she just wanted me to agree with her and tell her that I thought she was the best mom in the world. I think my mom and my mother in law both felt that my parenting choices were a rejection of them. They took our choices too personally and felt like my husband and I had personally rejected them by doing something so very different. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269037874,"authorName":"Karen Norman","from":"Karen Norman &lt;kazzarat@...&gt;","profile":"kazglc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re:Issues with our mothers","postDate":"1265291706","msgId":50446,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM3OTA4MjNBLjQ5NUEla2F6emFyYXRAYmx1ZXlvbmRlci5jby51az4="},"prevInTopic":50439,"nextInTopic":50456,"prevInTime":50445,"nextInTime":50447,"topicId":50439,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I was wanting to ask a question on this topic ­ I¹ve been formulating it in my head for ages but cant get it right!
