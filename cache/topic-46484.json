I was going to say that parents should not <br/>\nnecessarily expect that their unschooled teens will clean house while <br/>\nparents sleep, but it has happened here, too, so maybe it is something <br/>\nto expect. But, still, I do want to be upfront about the fact that I&#39;m <br/>\nmore likely to wake up to more mess than a clean kitchen. And, my kids <br/>\nDO get angry and raise their voices - I have three very passionate and <br/>\ndramatic daughters and they love each other deeply, they are each <br/>\nothers&#39; best friends, but they do have intense disagreements sometimes, <br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we do NOT have is anything even remotely resembling rebellion or <br/>\nparent-hating or wanting to get away. We spend a lot of time together, <br/>\nthey want their parents with them to hang out, go places, have fun <br/>\ntogether with them and their friends.  Yesterday we spent the day at the <br/>\ncounty fair - Rosie, Roxana, three of their friends, me, my husband. In <br/>\nthe evening, Roya joined us and our family all went to a Moody Blues <br/>\nconcert together and then spent another couple of hours at the fair, <br/>\nhaving fun together.  We took photo booth pictures - something teenagers <br/>\nlike to do with their friends. Our girls wanted their parents in with <br/>\nthem. I&#39;m LOVING these years of having teenagers and, now, young adults, <br/>\nas children. The ONLY down side is the possibility of them moving away, <br/>\nto follow their own interests and passions. But, even that possibility <br/>\nis a whole lot less difficult to face when you know your kid will want <br/>\nto stay in touch.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re not big on housework, and I do more than the rest of the family. <br/>\nBut everybody steps in to help when I&#39;m obviously busy or when I ask. <br/>\nAnd it isn&#39;t at ALL unusually for me to come home from somewhere and <br/>\nfind the dishwasher unloaded or the bathroom counters and toilet cleaned <br/>\nor, or the dining room table cleared of clutter, or something like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"What mainstream parents think; what an unschooler knows","postDate":"1248393571","msgId":46484,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM2MzMwRTY4LTg4M0YtNDYxMi04RjQ2LTQ2MzgwRjNBM0EzRUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":46487,"prevInTime":46483,"nextInTime":46485,"topicId":46484,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is a little long but very well worth reading.
