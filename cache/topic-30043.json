I think it was” Angel Hair for Kids”. We live near a small village","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1294400775\">My first & third daughter decided to grow their hair long for a Canadian<br/>\nOrganization. I think it was� Angel Hair for Kids�. We live near a small<br/>\nvillage and I called the local hair salon to ask if they would be able to<br/>\ncut their hair, but we had to make sure it was long enough for the donation.<br/>\nThey said sure & then told us they would cut it for free!! With their<br/>\npermission I called the local newspaper from a small town near us and<br/>\nsuggested it would be neat as we had never seen it done in our area before.<br/>\nSince my kids were inspired by a story in my in-laws local paper (6 + hour<br/>\ndrive away), we thought it might encourage other kids or adults too. So they<br/>\nwere on the front page of the last newspaper of that year!!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, it inspired the local Fair Ambassador to have her very long locks cut<br/>\nafter she handed over her crown to her successor. She decided to do it at<br/>\nthe fair & ask if others would like to do the same and also to donate<br/>\nfinancially as each wig cost about $1200.00. That year a couple of others<br/>\ndid do it and they raised enough for half a wig. Then next year my hair was<br/>\nlong enough as was my second & third daughter�s hair. So all 3 of us<br/>\ndonated. Then my DH said that if fair-goers would donate $100.00 he�d have<br/>\nis head shaved bald. I also raised over $100.00 from friends at the fair.<br/>\nTHEN they ended up with over $1200.00. The following year MORE men decided<br/>\nto take up the challenge & they made up pledge sheets ahead of time. There<br/>\nwere a couple of men who donated hair, but some were just getting shaved<br/>\nbald. Of course there were still the girls & women donating too.  It is now<br/>\na yearly tradition at our local fair to cut & donate for the fair. I have<br/>\ndone it twice and one dd did it once & one dd twice & another has done it 3<br/>\ntimes.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason my DH decided to have his head shaved that year was because one<br/>\nof our friends� dd was diagnosed with lymphoblastic leukemia. She is one of<br/>\nmy 3rd dd�s best friends. My husband stood up in front of all those people,<br/>\nwith tears in his eyes & told them the reason myself & 2 of our children<br/>\nwere donated & why he was fund-raising too. We were doing it for Cass. He<br/>\nsaid it would be awesome to get enough donations to buy one wig for<br/>\n$1200.00. The amazing thing is our town only has a total population of 500!!<br/>\nEven the people who worked at the carnival rides were donating. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe got involved in a Curling Cancer Bonspeil and we were off our goal by<br/>\n$200.00. DH offered to have his head shaved (it had grown back by then!) if<br/>\nthey could donate the extra $200.00. These people had already paid for their<br/>\nmeals, had donated prizes had bid on the auction and silent auction, yet the<br/>\nmanaged to come up with the $200.00. This was from 80 people!! <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting thing is Cass decided she didn�t want to wear a wig, but chose<br/>\nto wear hats instead. I lovely lady in the town near u gave me 3 lovely hats<br/>\nfor Cass. I am so lucky to be around so many generous people (not just money<br/>\nbut of time and helping others too).<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is actually the Fair Weekend & tonight my oldest daughter won<br/>\nAmbassador of the Fair. No�it is not a fashion show!! She had to do a quiz<br/>\nregarding the community both the village and especially the rural as we are<br/>\nan Agricultural Fair. She was also had to do a personal interview. Then they<br/>\nwere required to prepare a speech. The topic needed to involve the fair &<br/>\nagriculture. We have lived in the area over 9 years & been attending the<br/>\nfair for 10. We put crafts, flowers, etc in the fair as well. Anyways, the<br/>\njudges said she was the most mature of all the young ladies (6). Interesting<br/>\nas she was the youngest competitor (17) and the oldest was 20!! She won<br/>\nseveral ribbons in the Photography Section of the Fair as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThen my second youngest daughter was in the Youth Ambassador competition<br/>\nwith 4 other competitors. She sang �True Colours� with NO background music.<br/>\nShe won Youth Ambassador. We think this is the first time two sisters have<br/>\never won both the same year!!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBetter get myself to bed as it is going to be a VERY busy weekend. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKerri mom to:<br/>\n<br/>\nAmanda(17), Emma(15), Maddison(13), foster dd(12),<br/>\nJonah(10), foster ds(10), Saige & Claire(6, identical twin girls), foster<br/>\ndd(6),<br/>\nfoster ds(5), my little boy Teagan(3) PLUS: 2 horses, 1 pony, 3 dogs, 2<br/>\ncats, 1bunny rabbit, 4 guinea pigs, 3 rats( one is naked!), 1 teddy bear<br/>\nhamster & 3 dwarf hamsters & fostering a fuzzy orange tabby<br/>\nkitten with an upper respiratory infection. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHYPERLINK<br/>\n&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/message/30043;_ylc=X3oDMTJyZGU<br/>\n3MnA4BF9TAzk3MzU5NzE1BGdycElkAzQ0MTAyNTAEZ3Jwc3BJZAMxNzA1NTQyMTExBG1zZ0lkAzM<br/>\nwMDQzBHNlYwNkbXNnBHNsawN2bXNnBHN0aW1lAzExODQ4OTA0NTI-&quot;Locks of Love <br/>\n<br/>\nPosted by: &quot;kbcdlovejo@...&quot; HYPERLINK<br/>\n&quot;mailto:kbcdlovejo@...?Subject=%20Re%3ALocks%20of%20Love&quot;kbcdlovejo@aol.<br/>\ncom   HYPERLINK &quot;http://profiles.yahoo.com/kellyinsc&quot;kellyinsc <br/>\n<br/>\nThu Jul 19, 2007 12:22 pm (PST) <br/>\n<br/>\nDuncan has decided (again, but I think this time is for real) to cut <br/>\noff his long hair.

Do you have<br/>\n&gt; any advice?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Three of my family have done it; I donated 14 inches when I went from <br/>\nwaist-length to really short, my daughter donated when hers got long <br/>\nenough, and yes, my son did as well (I hated to see it go :-)  I went <br/>\nto a really nice salon that was holding a one-day event; the kids went <br/>\nto Great Clips, where they got a free cut for the donation.  Alex has <br/>\ncontinued to get his hair cut there, but Laura wasn&#39;t as happy with her <br/>\nstyle.  They&#39;re kind of a Supercuts sort of salon, and the quality of <br/>\nthe cut depends on who you happen to get.  He&#39;s only had one really bad <br/>\ncut, though; he likes it short and spiky now, and one stylist cut it <br/>\nway too short.  Hair grows, though :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Locks of Love","postDate":"1184872925","msgId":30043,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDOTk4NTEzOURFQUQyRi0xNzc4LTc0NEVAd2VibWFpbC1tZTE5LnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":30046,"prevInTime":30042,"nextInTime":30044,"topicId":30043,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Duncan has decided (again, but I think this time is for real) to cut off his long hair.
