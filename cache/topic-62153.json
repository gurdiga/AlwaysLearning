If he is really very short on ideas, maybe I would honestly<br/>\nguess - if I pretend I want to build something like that (not necessarily in<br/>\nminecraft, but with materials I do know something about, either lego or clay<br/>\nor matchsticks bricks) &quot;if I was using &lt;????&gt; I guess first I might _____<br/>\nand then I think I would ____&quot; I&#39;d try to remember to stop as soon as my son<br/>\nstarts coming up with his own ideas - and if he didn&#39;t I&#39;d quickly try to<br/>\ncome up with a different approach as an alternative just to prove there are<br/>\nother ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen some people plan big projects by drafting ideas in sketches first:<br/>\nsometimes by starting in one spot and then expanding, but othertimes by<br/>\nlaying out the available or desired space and then filling in; other times<br/>\nby sketching various bits separately and then trying to meld them together.<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers tend to talk and wave their hands while imagining.<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers go quiet, silent somewhere and just sit or lay and imagine for a few<br/>\nhours.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the city in video, the video could be played full screen then paused at<br/>\ndifferent points and then examined in detail, trying to guess what was done,<br/>\nperhaps with a magnifying glass.<br/>\n<br/>\nYoutube has comments, so you could add a comment asking the creator how it<br/>\nwas done - or asking all viewers how they think it was done or would do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;Related videos&quot; come sometimes extend the inspiration.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also the strategy of &quot;filing&quot; an idea: hmm, that&#39;s something to<br/>\nthink about - &quot;let&#39;s sleep on that one and see what we learn over time&quot;.  I<br/>\nalso use delicious bookmarks; but there are other online bookmarking<br/>\nservices, or the browser&#39;s bookmark feature (and you could show him how to<br/>\nset up folders to collect project ideas).  Alternatively a tool like<br/>\nEvernote works like a scrapbook.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62148,"nextTopicId":62109}}
