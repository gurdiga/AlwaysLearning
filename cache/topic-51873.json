It&#39;s just that I couldn&#39;t SEE (I&#39;m very <br/>\nvisual, if you hadn&#39;t guessed) how it would play out in our family, so it <br/>\nwas a lot like stepping out on a limb for me.

She chuckled and <br/>\nsaid, &quot;I just read this entire page, Mom. Can you believe that?&quot; The joke is <br/>\nbecause my daughter does NOT like to read, especially for information. I <br/>\nhave no idea how that happened, either, with both parents and all four <br/>\nbrothers being avid readers, but I digress. The bigger surprise came when <br/>\nshe told me that one of the website&#39;s suggestions was a certain percentage <br/>\nratio of fruits/veggies to protein to carbs. You have to understand: you <br/>\nmention a term that even smells like a math word and my daughter breaks out <br/>\nin hives. She said it herself, even smiling, and no hives.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that&#39;s a nice start to our day, personally. :D<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":51728,"nextTopicId":51783}}
