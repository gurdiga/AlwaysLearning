But, what I really mean is someone basically saying &quot;Just <br/>\na homemaker.&quot; I hope what I&#39;m saying makes sense. I hate it when <br/>\nsomeone asks me &quot;What do you do?&quot; And then when I give the <br/>\nanswer, &quot;Homeschooling Mom,&quot; or &quot;Homemaker,&quot; I am given that look and <br/>\nthen a fake reply of &quot;That&#39;s nice...&quot; Usually, because this person is <br/>\nworking behind a counter when they ask. I have to add here though, I <br/>\nhave just recently run into more and more women who honestly say <br/>\npositive things like, &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t blame you for homeschooling&quot;, <br/>\nor &quot;I would do the same if I didn&#39;t have to work,&quot; so times are <br/>\nchanging! Still,  I&#39;m fed up with people making me feel like I&#39;m no <br/>\none because I don&#39;t have a working title after my name! <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen we sat down at the table at the Title company to sign on our new <br/>\nhouse, we found out that the mortgage broker (who up to this point we <br/>\nonly communicated with over the phone) had planned the mortgage in my <br/>\ndh&#39;s name, only. We always put both names on the mortgage, and I was <br/>\nangry. Mark had done all the talking with him except for one phone <br/>\ncall that I made and he was very condescending to me, almost <br/>\nsarcastic. The title company woman called him to see why only Marks <br/>\nname was on the documents, and he said he assumed because Mark was <br/>\nthe sole provider, and the one he always spoke with, the mortgage was <br/>\nto be in his name!  UGH!!! Oh, I see, because I don&#39;t punch a clock, <br/>\nand have a respectable title to put in the occupation box, I&#39;m <br/>\nNOBODY! I have been upset over this ever since. Now we have to go <br/>\nthrough the trouble of a quit-claim deed to get my name on the house! <br/>\nI&#39;m am so livid!  <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve paid my dues. I worked and went to college when my firstborn was <br/>\ngrowing up. I landed that great corporate job, that society tried to <br/>\nmade me think was so important. All I ended up feeling was guilty for <br/>\nhaving to work when all I wanted to do was be there for my daughter. <br/>\nI&#39;m not knocking women who work and do it all, I&#39;ve been there, I <br/>\nknow it&#39;s do-able, and I&#39;m jealous that you have that little by-line <br/>\nafter your name: secretary, supervisor...<br/>\n <br/>\nBut, why isn&#39;t it just as respectable to say I&#39;m a homemaker, mother, <br/>\nhomeschool teacher? I want some credit!! Why, when asked, what we <br/>\ndo,  can&#39;t we say &quot;I&#39;m my kids Mom,&quot; as Dr. Laura says, and that <br/>\nanswer bring on some sort of &quot;Ahh, what a great job,&quot; with a look of <br/>\nrespect and appreciation on the askers face? What in the heck has <br/>\nhappened in our society that we, the homemakers, home teachers, <br/>\nwives, and mothers have become so disrespected? Just fifty years ago, <br/>\nif you were a homemaker, you were respected for the work you did, it <br/>\nwas, indeed a job, one of the most important jobs. Now society&#39;s <br/>\nattitude is one that believes anyone can make a home and raise kids. <br/>\nIt&#39;s a real woman who can keep house, raise kids and hold a job, so, <br/>\nif &quot;all you do&quot; is raise your kids, then you are looked upon as if <br/>\nyou have no skills, or intelligence. <br/>\n <br/>\nI think I&#39;ll send Mr. Mortgage Man a letter telling him, I am not <br/>\njust a stay-at-home Mom, I&#39;m a crusader! I&#39;m working every day from <br/>\nthe moment my feet touch the floor until the second my head hits the <br/>\npillow, and then sometimes a few times during those supposed sleeping <br/>\nhours. I work every minute of every day, with no government <br/>\nregulated, mandatory coffee breaks, no sick days, no weekends, no <br/>\nholidays off. And, contrary to popular belief, my job doesn&#39;t just <br/>\nconsist of dishing out macaroni and cheese and wiping noses. My job <br/>\nrequires I think before I speak, always. I must research constantly <br/>\nbecause I am not given a set of rules that, if followed, will keep me <br/>\nmoving up the company ladder. I&#39;m given a barrage of information from <br/>\nall different sources and it&#39;s up to me to decide what is right for <br/>\nmy family, and what is wrong. I must decide how to guide my children <br/>\nmorally and ethically while not sheltering them too much from the <br/>\ncraziness this world has become. Stress? Well, my job has it&#39;s fair <br/>\nshare. The difference is, I can&#39;t leave it all and come home each <br/>\nday. It&#39;s with me constantly as I lay in bed exhausted and wondering <br/>\nif I made the right decisions with each day. I&#39;ve accepted the <br/>\nhorrendous, slave-like, working conditions because I know the deeper <br/>\nreasons for taking this job. This job that has no accountability in <br/>\nsociety&#39;s eyes. This job with no paycheck. I&#39;m working to put a dent <br/>\nin society, help to change it for the better. I&#39;m working to create <br/>\nchildren who one day will be adults that are capable, well rounded, <br/>\nand strong. Adults who will feel confident, loved and compassionate <br/>\nabout what they believe in. Adults who have real moral values. Adults <br/>\nwho aren&#39;t afraid to work hard to achieve what they want, and who <br/>\nunderstand working hard is honorable. I&#39;m working to change society, <br/>\nand hopefully, as my husband said, I&#39;m one of the few in the spear <br/>\nhead, piercing through this mess that has become accepted as normal <br/>\nin our society. One of the few who have taken my job seriously, very <br/>\nseriously. I&#39;m a spear head. My job is creating a future, better <br/>\nworld. It is unfortunate, that people like you, Mr. Mortgage Man, <br/>\ncannot see farther than your upcoming weekend party, I will keep you <br/>\nin mind as I teach my children...<br/>\n <br/>\nRobin Yule<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;What we learn with pleasure we never forget.&quot;<br/>\nAlfred Mercier</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":112038769,"authorName":"Shyrley","from":"&quot;Shyrley&quot; &lt;shyrley.williams@...&gt;","profile":"bobalinga","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"I&#39;m back","postDate":"1039709126","msgId":11286,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIxMjEyMTYwMDQ0LkNGVEk2NTQ4Lm91dDAwNi52ZXJpem9uLm5ldEBtYXJrc2NvbXB1dGVyPg=="},"prevInTopic":5297,"nextInTopic":11287,"prevInTime":11285,"nextInTime":11287,"topicId":5296,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m back.
