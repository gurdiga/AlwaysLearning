I taught myself guitar when I was about 13 or so. I took lessons (or rather was forced to in music college) but they didn&#39;t teach me anything that I didn&#39;t already know. If you don&#39;t already have one, I would recommend picking up a book of guitar chords - they&#39;re easy to figure out and you&#39;ll be able to follow song sheets/fake books. Guitar tablature is also pretty easy to figure out - there are plenty of sites online to download this.<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy picking!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAileen<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Earthmomma67@...\">Earthmomma67@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, December 01, 2002 1:40 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] late learning musicians<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I now know how to play 6 whole notes on my new acoustic guitar!!
