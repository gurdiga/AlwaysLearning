How do you get started?  Can you use<br/>\nelectric clippers to shear?  I know the 4-H kids use clippers to slick shear<br/>\nfor livestock shows but perhaps they can&#39;t be used for wool to spin, I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow.You raise goats too don&#39;t you?  My dd&#39;s doe is due any day now and she<br/>\nis so scared something might happen to the new mom.  Any advice, comments,<br/>\nencouragement would be greatly appreciated.<br/>\nJulie in Texas&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, electric shears would be wonderful,  but I can&#39;t afford the ones that<br/>\nare tough enough to cut through sheeps wool. I&#39;m still a beginner with<br/>\nspinning.. my dh made a &#39;drop spindle&#39; for me..so finally I will be able to<br/>\nreally practice now that I have my own wool to experiment with.  I would<br/>\nlove a wheel, but also not something in my budget right now. ( I just spent<br/>\na bunch at Hoeggers for a stainless milk pail and strainer!)  My goats are<br/>\ndue to start kidding in April!  Email me sometime and we&#39;ll &#39;talk goat&#39;!<br/>\nJulie in MO</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5386,"nextTopicId":5388}}
