He was constantly asking the same things your dh is <br/>\nasking. He couldn&#39;t understand that they learn and thrive so much more when <br/>\nthe operative word in their lives is choice. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis went on until his mother, who is very much against hsing, (constantly <br/>\nasking me and the kids how our &quot;Little school is doing?&quot;) took the kids out <br/>\nfor a &quot;Grandma day&quot; and ended up having them tested a few months ago. He <br/>\nwasn&#39;t as upset about it as I was, he even said that he would like to know <br/>\nhow the kids were doing and couldn&#39;t see why I was so upset and frustrated <br/>\nabout it. He thought it would be a good measure of how Unschooling works. (or <br/>\nhis words, IF it works) Until I had enough and reminded him that the kids <br/>\nweren&#39;t hers to decide things like this for. How this was coming from a woman <br/>\nwho hauled him all over two states, five husbands, and 16 different schools <br/>\nwhile he was growing up. All because she lost a job or couldn&#39;t pay the rent, <br/>\nor found a new boyfriend or husband or the electricity was cut off, or the <br/>\nneighbors weren&#39;t right or what ever bee happened to fly up her.... <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been seeing a gradual change since then. He started telling me things <br/>\nlike how he learned so much from a certain teacher who had more progressive <br/>\nideas, who took the kids out camping just so they could see what stars look <br/>\nlike away from the city and canceled math for a month and taught them how to <br/>\ncook instead.  And when they went back to the book, they found they knew all <br/>\nabout fractions...<br/>\nHe still has some rethinking to work on. But then so do I! &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nI still hear some offhand comments every now and then. Like last night the <br/>\nkids were playing hangman on the chalk board, in the kitchen and Moly had a <br/>\nword that started with an Sq and ended in t and Jack couldn&#39;t get it. He kept <br/>\nthrowing out letters and Moly kept adding to the little man. Darin and I were <br/>\nwatching a movie and half listening to the kids when Jack called out for help <br/>\nand Darin said &quot;its probably spelling ALA Moly.&quot; So Moly brought the board in <br/>\nand I looked at the word and all the wrong guesses and asked her if the word <br/>\nwas Squirt. And she did have it spelled right, Jack just didn&#39;t know the rule <br/>\nof u after q and now he does. So Jack learned that and Darin learned Moly can <br/>\nspell. I would say he learned tact, but that remains to be seen. &lt;eg&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Betsy","from":"Betsy &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: pc battles","postDate":"1041609875","msgId":11459,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNFMTVCNDkzLjJEQzU0NDE1QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PGF2NDhwMCt0dnU3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":11458,"nextInTopic":11461,"prevInTime":11458,"nextInTime":11460,"topicId":11455,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**It s very hard to break free of that schoolish mindset, especially when he is working so much and all he sees is that she soesn t have to do anything that","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1147569400\">**It&#39;s very hard to break free of that <br/>\nschoolish mindset, especially when he is working so much and all he <br/>\nsees is that she soesn&#39;t have to do anything that she doesn&#39;t want to <br/>\ndo.
