For serious... I do have better things to do than return  <br/>\nposts.  And yes, I could just approve &quot;me too&quot; posts, but I care SO  <br/>\nMUCH about the Always Learning list that I&#39;m willing to keep it strong  <br/>\nand good even when the wind is blowing through palm trees ten feet  <br/>\nfrom  me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSO.  ANYone who is the least bit unsure of why I would be writing this  <br/>\nshould keep reading.<br/>\nAnd thank you to those who DO read their intro e-mails and who are  <br/>\ncareful when posting.   This list is an extremely valuable resource.   <br/>\nPlease help me keep it that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n=================================================================<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry to be returning two in one day ... but this just isn&#39;t useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ve quoted more than you&#39;ve written, and what you wrote isn&#39;t  <br/>\nadding to the discussion.  It won&#39;t help anyone understanding  <br/>\nunschooling better, nor does it ask a question that can be answered in  <br/>\nsuch ways that other people have new ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ve just joined the list, I see.  It&#39;s too soon to post anything.<br/>\nWhile you&#39;re reading and getting used to the list, please read these  <br/>\ntwo pages.  One should have come as an intro, by e-mail.  Both are in  <br/>\nfiles at the yahoogroups page, but are more easily read here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/lists/alwayslearningNEW\">http://sandradodd.com/lists/alwayslearningNEW</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/lists/alwayslearningPOSTS\">http://sandradodd.com/lists/alwayslearningPOSTS</a><br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55016,"nextTopicId":54846}}
