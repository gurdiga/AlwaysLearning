I must","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1013213696\">First, I want to thank those who shared the connection between the word unschooling and uncola. It makes me like the term unschooling a little more. I must admit I&#39;m a little uncomfortable with the word as I think it conjures up the wrong images in people&#39;s minds when you tell them that that is the educational path you&#39;ve chosen for your children.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy best friend growing up was a homeschooler and, while I was an honor roll student who loved learning, I hated high school... <br/>\n<br/>\n...I hated the cliques<br/>\n<br/>\n...I hated the English teacher that gave me a D on my oral report on Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde. I chose the book because my older cousin in college was studying the book and the relationship the book had to the addiction many in England had to cocaine. In my oral report I discussed the correlation between the book and drug addiction, but she felt that I missed the actual theme of the book, good vs. evil, and that I chose the book because it was less than 80 pages long. I read War and Peace for the second semester oral report on a classic book &lt;BEG&gt;. This teacher also questioned the existence of kudzu when I was supposed to write a factual essay. When I went up to her after class and told her that it did, in fact, exist and was a huge problem in Kentucky, she told me, &quot;well, if it does exist, I&#39;m sure you spelled it wrong&quot;?!?!?<br/>\n<br/>\n...I hated the History teacher whose entire method of teaching was standing in front of the classroom reading from the textbook in a monotone voice.<br/>\n<br/>\n...I hated the Gym teacher who gave me detention for chewing gum in her class. I showed up for detention. After waiting outside her locked door for 30 minutes for her to show up, I left. The next day she accused &quot;me&quot; of not showing up! <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, so maybe &quot;hate&quot; is a strong word, but you get the point.<br/>\n<br/>\nI finally convinced my parents to let me homeschool for my Junior year in high school. Sadly, it was the same year that my homeschooling friend moved to another state. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents purchased me 4 correspondence courses and I went from working 10 hours a week at our local health food store to managing their deli and working 40+ hours a week. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, I only completed a few assignments of the courses. I spent most of my time working and living. I lost contact with my school friends... we were living different lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nI met my husband, who was a homeless seventeen year old at the time. He was really the only person in my life I could relate to. Six months later I was pregnant. We were married 3 weeks after my 17th birthday. I never finished high school or went to college. This continued to bother me. I loved the learning part of school and while I continued to learn throughout adulthood and always regretted not having &quot;proof&quot; of what I knew. Part of that was that I felt trapped in my life and that I didn&#39;t have a lot of freedom... but that&#39;s a whole other story.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen 5 years ago, our oldest daughter, 10, is about to start 6th graded (first year of middle school). We hear horrible things about our local middle school and apply for a charter school. She was accepted and woke up at 5 am every morning to ride on a school bus for one hour (each way) to return home at 5 pm with 2-3 hours of homework each night. By the end of 6th grade, our daughter was stressed, cranky, exhausted, and constantly fighting with us. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband suggested we try homeschooling her the following year. Looking back at my homeschooling experience, I was dead set against it. I didn&#39;t want my daughter feeling alone and alienated as I had as a teenager which eventually made sneaking out of my window almost every night to be with my homeless boyfriend, now husband. <br/>\n<br/>\nI finally agreed to do a one year trial with the condition that she would be in some sort of activity where she could interact with other kids. I didn&#39;t know about homeschooling groups at that point.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that year was amazing! We absolutely loved it. My husband and I both work from home and it was fantastic. We loved having her home with us and brought our other two daughters home the following year. It&#39;s amazing how much more you learn about your children while homeschooling. We went from using K12.com to making our own curriculum. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest daughter was very focused on grades, &quot;being advanced&quot;, going to Harvard... she was missing the joy of learning. My middle daughter would just get through her assignments, doing as little as possible. My youngest daughter would complain about everything and just hated to read (which seriously bummed me out because my older two daughters and I LOVE reading).<br/>\n<br/>\nI began learning about unschooling. I loved the idea of it, but thought it was still important to teach grammar and math through Algebra II... wasn&#39;t it? At that point, we didn&#39;t actually know any unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast November, we moved to a new town and joined a homeschooling group run by an unschooling family. I was sold. I only had to convince my oldest daughter to give it a try. Turns out, she was sold on it as well after talking with the children of the unschooling family. She asked to stop taking all of her classes a couple of months ago (at which point I freaked out a little for a moment, lol), but I talked with my husband and he agreed to start unschooling our children. <br/>\n<br/>\nI still feel a little bit of panic every once in a while. But most days I love it. Right now my girls are having a blast in the pool. Yesterday, I walked into the computer room to find my 14 year old studying to take the AP Microeconomics exam next month (while she dropped the class, she decided to continue studying on her own), my 13 year old writing an essay on the relationship between education and liberty for a writing contest, and my 10 year old playing Disney&#39;s Toontown. Seeing them happily pursuing their own interests is really awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to eventually move to radical unschooling... my husband isn&#39;t quite sold on the idea... but I think we&#39;ll get there.<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Amanda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, k &lt;katherand@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What convinced you that radical unschooling was a good fit for your<br/>\n&gt; family?

What was the most convincing part for you about the idea of<br/>\nradical unschooling? &lt;~~<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry... this answer is going to run a little long.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a child, I hated school! As a military brat, moving all over, I was<br/>\nconstantly missing stuff (the topic wasn&#39;t being discussed yet by the school<br/>\nI was at, and had already been discussed at the school I would be moving<br/>\nto), or getting stuff twice. I hated the busy work in class, always getting<br/>\nin trouble for reading ahead, and thus not being where I was supposed to be.<br/>\nI remember in 4th grade, doing grammar work, and answering the questions in<br/>\nmy head, and moving to the next section and answering those questions, and<br/>\nso on, until suddenly the teacher called for the papers to be passed<br/>\nforward. I had no paper to pass forward, because though I&#39;d answered all the<br/>\nquestions, I hadn&#39;t written them down. I&#39;d get tired of listening to how<br/>\nslowly people read (I&#39;d learned very early - starting at age 3 with the seed<br/>\npackets from the garden Mom just put in), so I&#39;d read ahead in the story.<br/>\nI&#39;d get called on to read, and would often be in a different story. Got in<br/>\ntrouble for that. Was sent to a private school, in hopes by my parents that<br/>\nit would pull my grades up, since it was paced by the workbooks you were<br/>\ndoing. You did them at the speed you needed, so when you finished one, you<br/>\nwent to the next, whether the rest of the kids were at that point or not.<br/>\nThe other problem, for me, was the extreme attitude of the school - dancing<br/>\nand singing were bad, unless done in the &quot;Lord&#39;s House&quot;. Girls wore skirts<br/>\nto school, except on field trips - then we got to wear slacks. So skirts,<br/>\neven in the wet, cold south Texas winters, even if you were sick. I got<br/>\npaddled for wearing a pair of slacks to school (at my mother&#39;s insistance)<br/>\nbecause I was sick. Mom had to come bring me a skirt before I could go back<br/>\nto class. An increase in tuition found me back at public school, and I never<br/>\nwent to private school again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found myself increasingly bored in school, hated doing the busywork, hated<br/>\ndoing the homework. It felt like a waste of time for me to sit down with 30<br/>\nmath problems, or 20 questions to answer about whatever subject. Re: the<br/>\nmath, I either got it within a few problems or I didn&#39;t... continuing to do<br/>\nproblems I already understood was a waste of precious time that could be<br/>\nspent doing the countless hours of other homework I had; continuing to<br/>\nstruggle with problems I didn&#39;t understand was also a waste of that time.<br/>\nThe questions to be answered from other subjects were busywork - can you<br/>\nlook through the book, find the answer and then put it in your own words.<br/>\n*sigh* It all felt very wasteful. So my grades were not what my parents (and<br/>\nother family members) expected of me. I can&#39;t tell you how many times I<br/>\nheard the phrase &quot;You&#39;re smarter than this! Why don&#39;t you just do the work,<br/>\nand turn it in?&quot;  I could never seem to get them to understand my viewpoint.<br/>\nI&#39;d long ago learned the futility of doing things that I enjoyed, hearing<br/>\nsuch things as &quot;You need to have vocational skills so that you can get a job<br/>\ndoing *something*.&quot; &quot;You&#39;ll never make enough money as an artist to support<br/>\nyourself, you have to have something to fall back on.&quot; So I got a job before<br/>\nI was out of high school, met the man who be my first husband and worked.<br/>\n<br/>\nFast forward 5 years - married, our new son is 8 months old, and because of<br/>\nfinances, my husband joined the Navy (the one thing I&#39;d sworn as a child and<br/>\nteen was that I&#39;d never marry a military man - technically I didn&#39;t). We got<br/>\nstationed in San Diego, and then within two years, were informed the entire<br/>\nship and ship&#39;s company was moving homeports to western Washington. I<br/>\nrealized at that point I needed to do something about my son&#39;s education, so<br/>\nhe wasn&#39;t hopscotching around the way I did. I had an aunt who&#39;d bucked<br/>\nfamily wisdom and homeschooled her kids, so the precedent was there.<br/>\nWashington state is pretty homeschooler friendly, so I figured I&#39;d be able<br/>\nto handle it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Craig, my oldest, turned 6 he was old enough to be enrolled in school,<br/>\nthough you weren&#39;t required to actually send them to school until they were<br/>\n8 (if I remember correctly). We sat down and pulled out the kindergarten<br/>\nworkbook I&#39;d gotten - a comprehensive curriculum that offered everything -<br/>\nmath, science, reading/grammar, citizenship, environmental studies - all<br/>\ngeared towards the grade the child was in. After a week, a frustrating,<br/>\nhead-butting, angry, argument filled week, I realized something very<br/>\nimportant. I was trying to do to him what had happened to me in school.<br/>\nBusywork. He could answer the questions if I read them to him, did math in<br/>\nhis head easily, but writing the answers down was torture to him, as was<br/>\ntrying to read by himself. I decided maybe we needed to set things aside for<br/>\na little while - after all there were a couple of years before I had to<br/>\nofficially do anything formal (notifying the school district) about his<br/>\nschooling. In the meantime, I joined a couple of online support groups, and<br/>\nkept seeing the term &quot;unschooling&quot;. Asked some questions, did a bunch of<br/>\nresearch, read &quot;Growing without Schooling&quot; at the public library just a<br/>\ncouple years before the magazine stopped publishing, and realized that this<br/>\nwas the path for us. My husband wasn&#39;t real happy, but since Craig was<br/>\nhappy, and healthy, there wasn&#39;t a whole lot to complain about. Craig loved<br/>\nit. He spent the days building things with his Legos, played video games,<br/>\nwatched &quot;The Magic School Bus&quot; and explored the great outdoors. He had<br/>\nfreedom to go where he wanted (within the wide boundaries I&#39;d set for my 6<br/>\nyr old) - the one stipulation was coming home when his watch beeped - mostly<br/>\nto check in, in case I needed to run to the commissary or go pick up his Dad<br/>\nfrom work. It was during this time that Craig started asking if he could<br/>\nstay home when I went to pick up his Dad. He was involved in his Legos, and<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to stop building, and could he please stay home. Since I was<br/>\nonly 5 minutes away, I said yes. He started asking more and more often, and<br/>\nI said yes, unless it was going to be a longer trip (grocery shopping or<br/>\nsomething like that).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe turned back only once, when he was about 8, and we&#39;d been stationed back<br/>\nin California. I was getting pressure from everyone in the family (my sister<br/>\nwas the worst - her schooled daughter is 2 days younger than Craig) to do<br/>\nschool. They wanted a measurable something to see that he was actually<br/>\nlearning. After a week, we stopped again, because of many of the same issues<br/>\nas before... frustration with reading and writing. It almost hurt watching<br/>\nhim. We never looked back after that. I had a big talk with my mother, aunt,<br/>\na couple of family friends and told them that his schooling was my choice,<br/>\nand that his education was going to be better than anything he could get in<br/>\nschool - how much better a &quot;teacher/student&quot; ratio could they want than one<br/>\non one, and since in California we were registered as a private school, I<br/>\njust let it sit that way. They weren&#39;t happy, but it wasn&#39;t their choice. I<br/>\nalso figured out part of the reason Craig was having issues with reading and<br/>\nwriting was an allergic type reaction to the petroleum based additives in<br/>\nour food. So we set about changing our diet. He flourished with this diet,<br/>\nand was able to do so at home, without people teasing him for having<br/>\ndifferent foods, or being different. During our time in CA, he started<br/>\nasking if he could stay home when I went to drop his dad off at work - 2<br/>\nhours away one way. We had to leave the house by 3:30 in the morning, which<br/>\nmeant disrupting Craig&#39;s sleep (he didn&#39;t do the fall asleep in the car<br/>\nthing), and a 4 hour car trip. I thought about it for a little while, made<br/>\nsure he could dial my cell phone number, and his grandmother&#39;s (just in<br/>\ncase) and then we gave it a try. He was still sleeping when I got home. So<br/>\nwe continued to do that. Pretty soon, he indicated that he wanted to stay<br/>\nhome when I went to go get him (I dropped him off on Mon, picked him up on<br/>\nTh). Since we dealt with rush hour traffic, it meant a longer trip. Since<br/>\nhe&#39;d decided he was ready for this, I said yes. Made sure there were plenty<br/>\nof things in the kitchen for him to eat, and went and picked up his dad. It<br/>\nworked out well, and he was happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe moved to Colorado when Craig was almost 11, to a new life (my first<br/>\nhusband and I had filed for divorce - too much time apart left nothing in<br/>\nour marriage except a very roommate like friendship - it was amicable and<br/>\nthings went very smoothly) and a new man in our lives. Not too long after we<br/>\nsettled in, the new man and I realized that we were seeing some very erratic<br/>\nbehavior from Craig. It took a little work, but we sussed out the culprit -<br/>\nCorn syrup. Craig couldn&#39;t deal with it. So we removed the corn syrup, and<br/>\nsomething very interesting happened - his reading level shot from Captain<br/>\nUnderpants to The Chronicles of Narnia, and Harry Potter in a week. Not<br/>\nkidding. We&#39;ve noticed a slight dyslexia, but he&#39;s still miles ahead of<br/>\nwhere he was. At some point, our family structure took on the informal<br/>\n&quot;radical&quot; nature... probably because of the need for us to both be working,<br/>\nand the different hours (we both worked late shifts). It was never a<br/>\nconscious decision, it just sort of flowed out what we were already doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nFast forward to now - 5 years later. I&#39;m back at home with my kids (where I<br/>\nreally prefer to be), Craig&#39;s still loving the life we have, and we&#39;re doing<br/>\nthe same with Danny - who is 20 months. It took some learning on his part,<br/>\nbut my second husband is fully behind the unschooling. He had to deschool<br/>\nhimself - he went through an advanced high school program, his mom was a<br/>\npublic school teacher for 25 years and still works for the district she<br/>\ntaught in, and he had many good experiences in school. We had many<br/>\ndiscussions about it, I gave him plenty to read (including the Unschooling<br/>\nHandbook), and he finally realized that this was working for our family, and<br/>\nthat his experiences in school were not the norm for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe never really were convinced to radical unschool. It just flowed from what<br/>\nwe were doing and what we believed - that our children&#39;s happiness was more<br/>\nimportant than societal norms. Now, I&#39;m looking at a young man who&#39;s<br/>\nexpressed interest in going to the Not Back to School camp - probably the<br/>\none in Oregon - this summer. So we&#39;re looking at our one income budget to<br/>\ntry and find the extra monies to send him. At the end this year, he&#39;s going<br/>\nto Japan to visit his dad and stepmom - his dad is paying for the ticket -<br/>\nwhich he&#39;s thoroughly thrilled about. He&#39;s a huge anime and manga fan, and<br/>\nhis favorite console system (Nintendo) is based in Japan. He&#39;s also thrilled<br/>\nabout all the stuff he&#39;ll be able to see. He wants to learn Japanese before<br/>\nhe goes, so that he can at least say a few things in the language and be<br/>\nunderstood. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, sorry this was so long, but it really isn&#39;t just one story that got<br/>\nus to where we are.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura W<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":443530972,"authorName":"Laura Wray","from":"Laura Wray &lt;unschoolerslife@...&gt;","profile":"unschoolerslife","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Radical Unschooling Question","postDate":"1272410695","msgId":53518,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PHkyb2ZkOGIwMTI2MTAwNDI3MTYyNHhhNzg0NGM0YWlhYWZmZDg4Y2Q3MDExYmFhQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":53466,"nextInTopic":53522,"prevInTime":53517,"nextInTime":53519,"topicId":53378,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~ What convinced you that radical unschooling was a good fit for your family?

Re: the<br/>\nmath, I either got it within a few problems or I didn&#39;t... continuing to do<br/>\nproblems I already understood was a waste of precious time that could be<br/>\nspent doing the countless hours of other homework I had; continuing to<br/>\nstruggle with problems I didn&#39;t understand was also a waste of that time.<br/>\nThe questions to be answered from other subjects were busywork - can you<br/>\nlook through the book, find the answer and then put it in your own words.<br/>\n*sigh* It all felt very wasteful. So my grades were not what my parents (and<br/>\nother family members) expected of me. I can&#39;t tell you how many times I<br/>\nheard the phrase &quot;You&#39;re smarter than this! Why don&#39;t you just do the work,<br/>\nand turn it in?&quot;  I could never seem to get them to understand my<br/>\nviewpoint. I&#39;d long ago learned the futility of doing things that I enjoyed,<br/>\nhearing such things as &quot;You need to have vocational skills so that you can<br/>\nget a job doing *something*.&quot; &quot;You&#39;ll never make enough money as an artist<br/>\nto support yourself, you have to have something to fall back on.&quot; So I got a<br/>\njob before I was out of high school, met the man who be my first husband and<br/>\nworked.<br/>\n<br/>\nFast forward 5 years - married, our new son is 8 months old, and because of<br/>\nfinances, my husband joined the Navy (the one thing I&#39;d sworn as a child and<br/>\nteen was that I&#39;d never marry a military man - technically I didn&#39;t). We got<br/>\nstationed in San Diego, and then within two years, were informed the entire<br/>\nship and ship&#39;s company was moving homeports to western Washington. I<br/>\nrealized at that point I needed to do something about my son&#39;s education, so<br/>\nhe wasn&#39;t hopscotching around the way I did. I had an aunt who&#39;d bucked<br/>\nfamily wisdom and homeschooled her kids, so the precedent was there.<br/>\nWashington state is pretty homeschooler friendly, so I figured I&#39;d be able<br/>\nto handle it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Craig, my oldest, turned 6 he was old enough to be enrolled in school,<br/>\nthough you weren&#39;t required to actually send them to school until they were<br/>\n8 (if I remember correctly). We sat down and pulled out the kindergarten<br/>\nworkbook I&#39;d gotten - a comprehensive curriculum that offered everything -<br/>\nmath, science, reading/grammar, citizenship, environmental studies - all<br/>\ngeared towards the grade the child was in. After a week, a frustrating,<br/>\nhead-butting, angry, argument filled week, I realized something very<br/>\nimportant. I was trying to do to him what had happened to me in school.<br/>\nBusywork. He could answer the questions if I read them to him, did math in<br/>\nhis head easily, but writing the answers down was torture to him, as was<br/>\ntrying to read by himself. I decided maybe we needed to set things aside for<br/>\na little while - after all there were a couple of years before I had to<br/>\nofficially do anything formal (notifying the school district) about his<br/>\nschooling. In the meantime, I joined a couple of online support groups, and<br/>\nkept seeing the term &quot;unschooling&quot;. Asked some questions, did a bunch of<br/>\nresearch, read &quot;Growing without Schooling&quot; at the public library just a<br/>\ncouple years before the magazine stopped publishing, and realized that this<br/>\nwas the path for us. My husband wasn&#39;t real happy, but since Craig was<br/>\nhappy, and healthy, there wasn&#39;t a whole lot to complain about. Craig loved<br/>\nit. He spent the days building things with his Legos, played video games,<br/>\nwatched &quot;The Magic School Bus&quot; and explored the great outdoors. He had<br/>\nfreedom to go where he wanted (within the wide boundaries I&#39;d set for my 6<br/>\nyr old) - the one stipulation was coming home when his watch beeped - mostly<br/>\nto check in, in case I needed to run to the commissary or go pick up his Dad<br/>\nfrom work. It was during this time that Craig started asking if he could<br/>\nstay home when I went to pick up his Dad. He was involved in his Legos, and<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to stop building, and could he please stay home. Since I<br/>\nwas only 5 minutes away, I said yes. He started asking more and more often,<br/>\nand I said yes, unless it was going to be a longer trip (grocery shopping or<br/>\nsomething like that).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe turned back only once, when he was about 8, and we&#39;d been stationed back<br/>\nin California. I was getting pressure from everyone in the family (my sister<br/>\nwas the worst - her schooled daughter is 2 days younger than Craig) to do<br/>\nschool. They wanted a measurable something to see that he was actually<br/>\nlearning. After a week, we stopped again, because of many of the same issues<br/>\nas before... frustration with reading and writing. It almost hurt watching<br/>\nhim. We never looked back after that. I had a big talk with my mother, aunt,<br/>\na couple of family friends and told them that his schooling was my choice,<br/>\nand that his education was going to be better than anything he could get in<br/>\nschool - how much better a &quot;teacher/student&quot; ratio could they want than one<br/>\non one, and since in California we were registered as a private school, I<br/>\njust let it sit that way. They weren&#39;t happy, but it wasn&#39;t their choice. I<br/>\nalso figured out part of the reason Craig was having issues with reading and<br/>\nwriting was an allergic type reaction to the petroleum based additives in<br/>\nour food. So we set about changing our diet. He flourished with this diet,<br/>\nand was able to do so at home, without people teasing him for having<br/>\ndifferent foods, or being different. During our time in CA, he started<br/>\nasking if he could stay home when I went to drop his dad off at work - 2<br/>\nhours away one way. We had to leave the house by 3:30 in the morning, which<br/>\nmeant disrupting Craig&#39;s sleep (he didn&#39;t do the fall asleep in the car<br/>\nthing), and a 4 hour car trip. I thought about it for a little while, made<br/>\nsure he could dial my cell phone number, and his grandmother&#39;s (just in<br/>\ncase) and then we gave it a try. He was still sleeping when I got home. So<br/>\nwe continued to do that. Pretty soon, he indicated that he wanted to stay<br/>\nhome when I went to go get him (I dropped him off on Mon, picked him up on<br/>\nTh). Since we dealt with rush hour traffic, it meant a longer trip. Since<br/>\nhe&#39;d decided he was ready for this, I said yes. Made sure there were plenty<br/>\nof things in the kitchen for him to eat, and went and picked up his dad. It<br/>\nworked out well, and he was happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe moved to Colorado when Craig was almost 11, to a new life (my first<br/>\nhusband and I had filed for divorce - too much time apart left nothing in<br/>\nour marriage except a very roommate like friendship - it was amicable and<br/>\nthings went very smoothly) and a new man in our lives. Not too long after we<br/>\nsettled in, the new man and I realized that we were seeing some very erratic<br/>\nbehavior from Craig. It took a little work, but we sussed out the culprit -<br/>\nCorn syrup. Craig couldn&#39;t deal with it. So we removed the corn syrup, and<br/>\nsomething very interesting happened - his reading level shot from Captain<br/>\nUnderpants to The Chronicles of Narnia, and Harry Potter in a week. Not<br/>\nkidding. We&#39;ve noticed a slight dyslexia, but he&#39;s still miles ahead of<br/>\nwhere he was. At some point, our family structure took on the informal<br/>\n&quot;radical&quot; nature... probably because of the need for us to both be working,<br/>\nand the different hours (we both worked late shifts). It was never a<br/>\nconscious decision, it just sort of flowed out what we were already doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nFast forward to now - 5 years later. I&#39;m back at home with my kids (where I<br/>\nreally prefer to be), Craig&#39;s still loving the life we have, and we&#39;re doing<br/>\nthe same with Danny - who is 20 months. It took some learning on his part,<br/>\nbut my second husband is fully behind the unschooling. He had to deschool<br/>\nhimself - he went through an advanced high school program, his mom was a<br/>\npublic school teacher for 25 years and still works for the district she<br/>\ntaught in, and he had many good experiences in school. We had many<br/>\ndiscussions about it, I gave him plenty to read (including the Unschooling<br/>\nHandbook), and he finally realized that this was working for our family, and<br/>\nthat his experiences in school were not the norm for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe never really were convinced to radical unschool. It just flowed from what<br/>\nwe were doing and what we believed - that our children&#39;s happiness was more<br/>\nimportant than societal norms. Now, I&#39;m looking at a young man who&#39;s<br/>\nexpressed interest in going to the Not Back to School camp - probably<br/>\nthe one in Oregon - this summer. So we&#39;re looking at our one income budget<br/>\nto try and find the extra monies to send him. At the end this year, he&#39;s<br/>\ngoing to Japan to visit his dad and stepmom - his dad is paying for the<br/>\nticket - which he&#39;s thoroughly thrilled about. He&#39;s a huge anime and manga<br/>\nfan, and his favorite console system (Nintendo) is based in Japan. He&#39;s also<br/>\nthrilled about all the stuff he&#39;ll be able to see. He wants to learn<br/>\nJapanese before he goes, so that he can at least say a few things in the<br/>\nlanguage and be understood. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, sorry this was so long, but it really isn&#39;t just one story that got<br/>\nus to where we are.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura W<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Radical Unschooling Question","postDate":"1272302905","msgId":53465,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwRTJCOTk3LUU4MjgtNDE2OS04NkNGLUU4OUVGMTgwMTgzM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGgybjNhOTNmZmYxMTAwNDI2MDkwN3g2OWMxZTdhYng3YWMwNThjOTFiOWZkNmE5QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGcydjNhOTNmZmYxMTAwNDI0MjAwOHFmOTk0NmVhNXphMDUyMTA1MzEzMzIyZGZjQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8djJzNzljMWQxYjQxMDA0MjYwMTA2ejVkZDQyZDI3dWQ5ZDIzMGEzYTM2NDQzNGNAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+IDxoMm4zYTkzZmZmMTEwMDQyNjA5MDd4NjljMWU3YWJ4N2FjMDU4YzkxYjlmZDZhOUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":53455,"nextInTopic":53466,"prevInTime":53464,"nextInTime":53466,"topicId":53378,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-As to the word unschooling, I have liked it ever since I heard that its origins were John Holt s coining of the word as inspired by the famous Uncola tv","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-687319470\">-=-As to the word unschooling, I have liked it ever since I heard that<br/>\nits origins were John Holt&#39;s coining of the word as inspired by the<br/>\nfamous Uncola tv commercial of the 70s.

True.<br/>\nEspecially in relation to children, who are noticeably inconvenient in<br/>\na previously child-free lifestyle. Unschooling is a way to extend<br/>\nattachment parenting for many people. It was for me, and that&#39;s a big<br/>\nreason I took a liking to unschooling. I was still breastfeeding, for<br/>\none thing. So the idea of putting a child in school away from mother<br/>\nand comfort seems antithetical to what the child would want to do.

Did many teacher&#39;s programmes for sensitivity<br/>\n&gt; training, and got a first hand look at the psychological mess soup that kids<br/>\n&gt; are thrown into without supervision. Sometimes teachers have their own<br/>\n&gt; issues, other times the structure creates them. End result is always no one<br/>\n&gt; sitting and talking for the children&#39;s dignity, because life is an endless<br/>\n&gt; crisis management and problem solving situation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Experienced first hand something I knew from attending my own school. The<br/>\n&gt; lack of belief in the usefulness of acting on values professed was not<br/>\n&gt; limited to my school. It is an epidemic infecting every educational<br/>\n&gt; institution I came across without exception. You ARE supposed to compromise,<br/>\n&gt; recommend compromise, enforce compromise to prevent anything rocking the<br/>\n&gt; boat - even if the boat is alternative, experiential education.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; By the time I had my own child, there was no question of me even considering<br/>\n&gt; sending him into this toxic mess. We were fine.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That is one side of the story.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The other is my experiences with horses. I had pack ponies for treks and<br/>\n&gt; mares for breeding who also went on treks when not pregnant or with foal. I<br/>\n&gt; went through great efforts to ensure their well being by keeping the foal<br/>\n&gt; with the dam till it was of working age. Even then, I used to ensure that<br/>\n&gt; they worked together. Till I noticed the foals becoming independent of the<br/>\n&gt; dam and finding their own company of choice (usually similar ages). That was<br/>\n&gt; the point I used to consider the foals weaned, regardless of whether they<br/>\n&gt; were still drinking milk or not. Post that point, I didn&#39;t make any<br/>\n&gt; particular efforts to keep them together or separate them, letting the work<br/>\n&gt; decide and leaving them free when not working. I found that adult horses<br/>\n&gt; whom I find of a lovely temperament rarely are excessively attached to their<br/>\n&gt; parents in terms of suffering if separated. However, they will often &#39;touch<br/>\n&gt; base&#39; so to say. If I can do so much for horses, why in the world would I<br/>\n&gt; force my own child away from my side and constant company before he was<br/>\n&gt; ready to initiate it? I want my child to have me available till he initiates<br/>\n&gt; separation. I think the whole world has it upside down when they teach kids<br/>\n&gt; to be independent and expect adults to feel attachment towards their<br/>\n&gt; parents. I think it is dehumanizing children to make them independent and<br/>\n&gt; thus less of an effort to invest and then expect caring in the old age -<br/>\n&gt; like an insurance plan. Feelings can&#39;t be expected to fit convenience.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think unconsciously, we all seek to leave a mark on the world. A monument,<br/>\n&gt; so to say. Children are the most accessible way of doing it. Unfortunately,<br/>\n&gt; most people try to &#39;mold&#39; their kids in their image, or better still, an<br/>\n&gt; image the tourists (society) will admire. They forget that it is a person<br/>\n&gt; with potential beyond what they &#39;allot&#39; and the healthy tree is one that is<br/>\n&gt; free to send out roots and branches to choose the nutrients IT needs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My experiences with kids taught me that the principles of experiential<br/>\n&gt; learning and appreciative inquiry worked well to create deep relationships,<br/>\n&gt; learning environment and empowered children. Did that with my own child too,<br/>\n&gt; of course. In fact, it is how I now am - whether with a child or adult or my<br/>\n&gt; own or another&#39;s.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; By the time I found unschooling, all that remained was to have a name for<br/>\n&gt; what I did (I hadn&#39;t even thought I missed a name, till I realized a label<br/>\n&gt; can let me have a community of kindred souls), since I was also now a<br/>\n&gt; parent, companion and a child&#39;s chief learning facilitator/coach (?) in<br/>\n&gt; addition to experiential learning.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So here I am.

What I saw was following my heart was rebellion to<br/>\nthe world, though I actually went through a lot of effort to follow as many<br/>\nrules as I could without compromising my goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater, created a life for myself after leaving family with great loneliness.<br/>\nBecame an experiential learning facilitator, which helped me understand many<br/>\nprocesses of human interaction and learning. It gave me the validation I<br/>\nneeded - that I was fine, and large number of people being invasive of my<br/>\ndignity didn&#39;t change that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorked with children a lot and found that treating them with respect makes<br/>\nfor joy and ease of living. Did many teacher&#39;s programmes for sensitivity<br/>\ntraining, and got a first hand look at the psychological mess soup that kids<br/>\nare thrown into without supervision. Sometimes teachers have their own<br/>\nissues, other times the structure creates them. End result is always no one<br/>\nsitting and talking for the children&#39;s dignity, because life is an endless<br/>\ncrisis management and problem solving situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nExperienced first hand something I knew from attending my own school. The<br/>\nlack of belief in the usefulness of acting on values professed was not<br/>\nlimited to my school. It is an epidemic infecting every educational<br/>\ninstitution I came across without exception. You ARE supposed to compromise,<br/>\nrecommend compromise, enforce compromise to prevent anything rocking the<br/>\nboat - even if the boat is alternative, experiential education.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time I had my own child, there was no question of me even considering<br/>\nsending him into this toxic mess. We were fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is one side of the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other is my experiences with horses. I had pack ponies for treks and<br/>\nmares for breeding who also went on treks when not pregnant or with foal. I<br/>\nwent through great efforts to ensure their well being by keeping the foal<br/>\nwith the dam till it was of working age. Even then, I used to ensure that<br/>\nthey worked together. Till I noticed the foals becoming independent of the<br/>\ndam and finding their own company of choice (usually similar ages). That was<br/>\nthe point I used to consider the foals weaned, regardless of whether they<br/>\nwere still drinking milk or not. Post that point, I didn&#39;t make any<br/>\nparticular efforts to keep them together or separate them, letting the work<br/>\ndecide and leaving them free when not working. I found that adult horses<br/>\nwhom I find of a lovely temperament rarely are excessively attached to their<br/>\nparents in terms of suffering if separated. However, they will often &#39;touch<br/>\nbase&#39; so to say. If I can do so much for horses, why in the world would I<br/>\nforce my own child away from my side and constant company before he was<br/>\nready to initiate it? I want my child to have me available till he initiates<br/>\nseparation. I think the whole world has it upside down when they teach kids<br/>\nto be independent and expect adults to feel attachment towards their<br/>\nparents. I think it is dehumanizing children to make them independent and<br/>\nthus less of an effort to invest and then expect caring in the old age -<br/>\nlike an insurance plan. Feelings can&#39;t be expected to fit convenience.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think unconsciously, we all seek to leave a mark on the world. A monument,<br/>\nso to say. Children are the most accessible way of doing it. Unfortunately,<br/>\nmost people try to &#39;mold&#39; their kids in their image, or better still, an<br/>\nimage the tourists (society) will admire. They forget that it is a person<br/>\nwith potential beyond what they &#39;allot&#39; and the healthy tree is one that is<br/>\nfree to send out roots and branches to choose the nutrients IT needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy experiences with kids taught me that the principles of experiential<br/>\nlearning and appreciative inquiry worked well to create deep relationships,<br/>\nlearning environment and empowered children. Did that with my own child too,<br/>\nof course. In fact, it is how I now am - whether with a child or adult or my<br/>\nown or another&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time I found unschooling, all that remained was to have a name for<br/>\nwhat I did (I hadn&#39;t even thought I missed a name, till I realized a label<br/>\ncan let me have a community of kindred souls), since I was also now a<br/>\nparent, companion and a child&#39;s chief learning facilitator/coach (?) in<br/>\naddition to experiential learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here I am. Unschooling, though I hate that counter dependent word,<br/>\nbecause it fits what we are up to..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re:Radical Unschooling Question","postDate":"1272242555","msgId":53426,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PHAyczNhOTNmZmYxMTAwNDI1MTc0MmtlNGM1YTU2MXZiYTBlZWU3MmIxMGU3ZjllQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDRCRDQzMjc2LjgwMzAxMDBAeWFob28uY2E+","referencesHeader":"PDRCRDQzMjc2LjgwMzAxMDBAeWFob28uY2E+"},"prevInTopic":53389,"nextInTopic":53442,"prevInTime":53425,"nextInTime":53427,"topicId":53378,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I like that: the path of least resistance.
