It&#39;s important to remember that everyone in a school system is confined and institutionalized, and we all suffer negative effects from it.  I say this as a former teacher.  No, I never hated the kids in my class, but I was absolutely torn up inside about the way the school environment was sucking the life, independence, and individuality right out of them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think a lot of people in schools can see this to some degree, without even knowing what they&#39;re seeing, and without knowing what to do about it.  Some of them blame the kids for what&#39;s happening (maybe the teacher in your example), some of them blame the school administration, some of them blame the parents, and some of them blame themselves.  That&#39;s what I did.  I blamed myself for the negative effects of their imprisonment, so I kept searching for the perfect teaching technique, the perfect approach that would make it all better.  When I realized what the real problem was--basically an across-the-board, institutionalized lack of respect for kids, I had to leave.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I don&#39;t think she hates all kids.  She&#39;s just caught up in a tremendously frustrating and damaging system, one that hurts kids and teachers alike.  And when she&#39;s with a fellow teacher, she&#39;s just releasing all her frustration.  <br/>\n<br/>\nStill healing,<br/>\nJulie from NY <br/>\n(Signing this way because I just realized I&#39;m the second Julie on the list. :)  Sorry for previous confusion!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Alyce <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, October 20, 2003 11:44 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] super teachers<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n     Date: Sun, 19 Oct 2003 02:13:38 -0400<br/>\n     From: &quot;Kate ODonovan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kateod@...\">kateod@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n  Subject: Re: &quot;super teachers&quot;<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;...She told me that she likes working in the city because the majority<br/>\n  of the students&#39; parents were non-english speaking and didn&#39;t really<br/>\n  know their children&#39;s rights in school, i.e. if one of the children<br/>\n  needed extra support or services and how to go about obtaining those<br/>\n  services.
