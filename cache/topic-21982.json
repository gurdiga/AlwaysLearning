I have found recently that I am better at sleeping.  Sleep has however been a difficult thing for me for as long as I can remember.  It is only in the last few months that I am more able to full asleep and have actually slept for more than 2hrs at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nJay <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, April 08, 2005 7:31 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Bed time<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n  -=- I actually need the least sleep and find if I <br/>\n  do fall   asleep while waiting for them to I wake up about 2 unable to sleep  <br/>\n  again  till  about 6 and then am tired for the rest of the  day.  Any  <br/>\n  suggestions-=-<br/>\n   <br/>\n  This might not apply to the original author, but just as a piece of data  <br/>\n  into the larger stream, remember menopause.  When women get older they will  <br/>\n  sleep differently.  It seems one of the easiest and biggest strains on  <br/>\n  relationships is that menopausal women will blame others for making them  uncomfortable <br/>\n  and for keeping them from sleeping when it&#39;s just hormonal  changes.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I&#39;ve known several couples get divorced from inflexibility and lack of  <br/>\n  awareness and compassion.  It doesn&#39;t just goe one way, either.  Some  men get <br/>\n  angry when their wives have a hormone storm.  Sometimes wives just  want to be <br/>\n  self-righteous and blame others for their natural discomforts.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Once again, being compassionate about kids&#39; changes can help affect how  <br/>\n  adults respond to their own and each others&#39; needs and changes.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Yahoo!
