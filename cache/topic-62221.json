Since I posted Pam Sooroshian&#39;s quote about being your childs friend on Facebook and some of my college friends commented with &quot;Yeah, but...&quot; kind of responses.  They got defensive when their ideas were challenged.  They said they were being attacked.  No one was attacked.

But parenting ideas can feel very personal. Loaded with emotions like guilt, fear, hope, and love for our children we attach ourselves to our decisions and we cannot seperate even for the sake of discussion.  And maybe we shouldn&#39;t detach...it&#39;s partly because of the importance of the questions and my attachment to my children that I have challenged myself to learn and apply unschooling principles to my life.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  But when someone says something like, &quot;If you don&#39;t use punishments children will be monsters&quot; or &quot;If you don&#39;t require algebra children will never be able to go to college or be smart or go into certain fields like engineering.&quot; --I don&#39;t feel attacked.  Is this an &quot;attack&quot; on my idea?  Sometimes I&#39;ve wondered if I should defend my kids or kids like mine? But I usually don&#39;t respond  because I know my kids. And what they are saying is just not true. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Stay attached, connected to your kid but detach from the ideas while discussing them?

The<br/>\nrhetoric garners lots of attention.  Anyone advocating for children&#39;s<br/>\nautonomy or questioning the orthodoxy is seen as &quot;attacking&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sure the OP is shocked by someone who casually mentions having to beat<br/>\nhis wife so she&#39;ll have dinner on the table or if she claimed she whips the<br/>\nkids until they find acceptable hobbies and interests.  Somehow &quot;stealing&quot;<br/>\nfrom kids isn&#39;t seen as a theft. People draw arbitrary lines and balk at<br/>\ndefending them.

It also seems to me that the person is more of an academic unschooler.  I&#39;ve read posts from a few people who call themselves unschoolers on Facebook posting things on their personal pages about putting their kids in time out, taking away toys/gadgets and calling themselves unschoolers because it&#39;s summer time and they&#39;re not doing lessons. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think anyone was attacking the original poster&#39;s ideas at all.  I see Sandra&#39;s and Lyla&#39;s posts (among others) more as questioning of the ideas of the original poster.  I also don&#39;t think a unschooling group on Facebook will ever have the kind of in-depth discussions that happen on this list.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDina<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is most of an exchange on facebook, on a page marked for unschoolers.
