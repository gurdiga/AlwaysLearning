That poor Little Sandra. <br/>\n*********************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember crying in first grade, too, because there was an older kid who would bully some of us before school and during lunch recess.  He&#39;d take our lunch boxes, the metal kind, and bash them against the school wall.  I was terrified.  I remember one day in particular, the day I realized I was on my own to deal with this.  Our teacher lined us up in the classroom and we couldn&#39;t walk single-file down to lunch until everyone was still and quiet.  I was sniffling in line, trying really hard not to cry, afraid to go to recess after lunch.  Afraid, even, to go to lunch because we couldn&#39;t choose where to sit, we had to sit where the lunchroom aides told us to sit and that was risky.  The teacher leaned over at the front of the line, peered at me with eyebrows raised, and said, &quot;We can&#39;t leave until you stop crying, Laura.&quot;  I was completely horrified.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t exactly remember much about that school after that.  We moved to a small town the following summer and I was SO excited because I had cousins there and I felt like I&#39;d have people on my side.  And I did.<br/>\n<br/>\nI taught 4th and 5th grades full-time when Brady, now 17, was young.  He developed some serious anxiety about being left alone; he would cry out if I&#39;d even use the bathroom in our house without telling him I was going in there.   When I quit teaching I was telling the special ed teacher that homeschooling would be good for Brady, so he&#39;d feel more secure.  She said, &quot;How are you going to get him used to being alone?  You could make him be alone in his room for one minute, then increase it to two minutes, then three, until he&#39;s over it.  What will you do?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI told her that actually I planned to see that he was never, ever, left alone, that he always feel secure, until he felt ready to do things without me close by.  It took a long time.  He eventually grew more confident; slowly, gradually, as he was ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of his earlier fears, he never wanted to try camps or any such things, although he did do overnights at houses of friends who were respectful of his needs.  I&#39;d still tell him about opportunities that arose.  Eventually I stopped, though.  Just recently he said, &quot;Why don&#39;t you ever ask me about camp anymore?  I might want to go sometime.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*~*~*~*~*<br/>\n&quot;Keep company with those who make you better.&quot; ~ English saying<br/>\n*~*~*~*~*<br/>\nwww.piscesgrrrl.blogspot.com<br/>\n*~*~*~*~*<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279647515,"authorName":"deborahkmlewis","from":"&quot;deborahkmlewis&quot; &lt;d.lewis@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: analogy i&#39;ve been pondering","postDate":"1256242368","msgId":48085,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhicWVjMCsxMDQ3Z0BlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDc0MjQzMC4yNTYxNy5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDgubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48084,"nextInTopic":48086,"prevInTime":48084,"nextInTime":48086,"topicId":48066,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***to put aside their own discomforts to help their kids be better and safer and happier,  and somehow it can be very healing for the parents too! *** In","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1279023804\">***to put aside their own discomforts to help their kids be better and safer and happier,  and somehow it can be very healing for the parents too! ***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn thirty years it will be interesting to see if he&#39;s more or less comfortable in big crowds.

It&#39;s very odd - he&#39;s talking about how miserable it was, how he spent most of a year out in the hall (which is where he started cartooning). He talks about how teachers told him his creativity would amount to nothing. Meanwhile all the teachers in the audience are laughing and laughing. Surreal. He ends by saying he&#39;s grateful for the experience because it made him who he is --- I think it&#39;s finding the good in a bad situation. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s truly grateful for that hurtful experience, but perhaps understands that bitterness is destructive and so he takes that negative history and turns into something positive.

There is a social skills group in my area for kids on the autism spectrum (mostly Aspergers) which I had heard so many great things about.  So I checked out the program and jumped through many hoops to get him signed up, and lo and behold he hated it.  My anxiety about his social skills prompted me to keep him there whether he liked it or not because he really needed these skills.  Finally his misery was so great that I was forced to see that he wasn&#39;t getting anything out of this group and I pulled him out.  One of the objectives for him had been &quot;spontaneous interactions with others&quot;.  In other words, we all wanted to see him talk to other people without being prompted by me (he interacted well with immediate family).  He never met that objective.  Then some weeks or months after I pulled him out of the program, we were standing in line at Petco with our dog to get him vaccinated, and ds said to the woman in front of us, while looking her in the eyes in a relaxed and friendly manner, &quot;Your dog is cute.  What kind of dog is it?&quot;  Inside my head my jaw dropped to the floor.  He talked to someone (a stranger even) because he was interested in talking to her and was curious (go figure)!  He knew enough about interacting with others by interacting with his family and by watching us with others.  He didn&#39;t need to be taught.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; she mentioned temple grandin, the writer who&#39;s autistic - and apparently says that the rules and expectations that were immutable in her childhood... <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m also familiar with Temple Grandin, and while it may be true (maybe) that rules and expectations helped her, she also said that when she was a young child she was not engaged at all with the world around her, so her mother made her way into Temple&#39;s world.  This is the beauty--for all kids--of unschooling.  We parents can meet our kids where they are and then gently help them expand their world.  It can be pointless or even harmful to put kids in situations they&#39;re not prepared to &quot;learn from&quot;. <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - the requirements to conform and get outside her own head and world - are what saved her in some respects.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe and maybe not.

I&#39;m still new to unschooling and have come to it afer struggling to homeschool my two dks, one of which is somewhere on the autism spectrum - adhdish. My realization, both with my son and with the kids I&#39;ve worked with in the school system, is that you can&#39;t push a child to do something that they can&#39;t or aren&#39;t ready to do. That includes socialization, I think. My mom recently volunteered in a school - she had to supervise a child in an assignment. She tried working with the child and went back to the teacher. She told the teacher that he simply couldn&#39;t do the task. The teacher said, &#39;I know, but that&#39;s what&#39;s required of him&#39;. So my mother was expected to basically babysit him while he attempted to accomplish something he was not capable of doing. She could have spent that hour actually playing games with him, reading to him -- anything but that.<br/>\n<br/>\ni&#39;ve watched my son attempt to write - he tells me that he knows the information in one part of his brain but he can&#39;t get it out the other side. I&#39;m not going to push or insist that he do it now when he so obviously can&#39;t  - it&#39;s not about spelling or letter formation or willingness - he just can&#39;t. Whether or not he can in the future irrelovant to me - he can&#39;t do it right now, so we find other ways for him to express himself. The same goes for socialization. There are days where social acitivities are simply too much -noisy, busy, complicated. Sometimes I just want to tell him to stop being such a poop, but really, he simply can&#39;t handle it at that time. There is no point in forcing a child into social situations they can&#39;t handle. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think unschooling is the absolute best way for exceptional children - it&#39;s respectful and it focusses on what they CAN do. School focusses a whole lot on what they CAN&#39;T do and spends a lot of time trying to figure out how to force a square peg child into a round hole society.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185586397,"authorName":"Lyla Wolfenstein","from":"&quot;Lyla Wolfenstein&quot;

children, and how she needs no convicing about the academic aspects of unschooling - she&#39;s totally sold on the notions that real learning happens through passion and inspiration, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nit&#39;s the social learning - the being &quot;in the world&quot; and the ability to *conform* to societal expectations that she is struggling with - with a kid with an aspergers diagnosis, who struggles with that realm in particular, it&#39;s very hard for her to take that leap of faith and trust.  <br/>\n<br/>\nshe mentioned temple grandin, the writer who&#39;s autistic - and apparently says that the rules and expectations that were immutable in her childhood - the requirements to conform and get outside her own head and world - are what saved her in some respects.  <br/>\n<br/>\ni pondered that for a few minutes, and then tried to describe how that social learning, that ability to engage with the world, comes from a place of *support* and partnership, not demand that someone stretch themselves further than they are ready.  that perhaps having parents and other people in one&#39;s life who see the subtle cues of readiness for next steps into the greater world, especially for kids who are introverted and &quot;in their own head&quot; a lot, is, in my mind, so much more valuable than force or coerscion.  that maybe for someone with a tendency to be reclusive and disconnected from the world, having NOBODY seeing those cues, or slowly, kindly, patiently, lovingly helping a child stretch toward the next step, would be devastating - but that doesn&#39;t mean that putting a kid in a school and therapies focused on premature stretching is inherently better - and that&#39;s where good unschooling solves the &quot;problem.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\ni then developed an analogy i&#39;m pretty happy with, and i wonder what others think  - <br/>\n<br/>\nit&#39;s about &quot;absorption&quot; -  different forms of vitamins have different levels of absorbability - and our bodies have the capacity to metabolize each vitamin/nutrient differently - so, if you give a vitamin or nutrient (in food)  in dosages that exceed what our body can absorb all at once, the excess is excreted, unused (or can build up and become toxic!) - and if you give a form of nutrient that is less well absorbed by our bodies - for instance the iron breastmilk vs. iron supplements - you will have to give a much larger quantity and at just the right times to even approximate the benefits our body gets from the highly aborbable form.  if your body gets the benefit of nutrients in their most biologically natural state for superior absorption, no planning or thinking needs to go into it - health nutrition status just happens, exactly as it&#39;s designed to happen, in a biologically normal way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nwith unschooling, being in tune with the subtle changes and readiness for new challanges in the social realm, and providing opportunities and being responsive to that readiness is like giving nutrients in their naturally bioavailable form - *for that person* - it&#39;s highly and readily absorbed and growth happens in leaps and  bounds, with not a lot of energy wasted/excreted.  <br/>\n<br/>\nif we try to &quot;give&#39; our kids skills for which they are not ready, or push them to branch out and connect socially or with the larger world in ways that cause more stress than growth, it&#39;s like loading them with vitamins that are minimally absorbably, or giving them  MORE vitamins than their bodies can absorb at one time - the excess is excreted at best (energy wasted) and toxic at worst - often a mix of the two.<br/>\n<br/>\nthis could apply to the more &quot;academic&quot; aspects of unschooling too.<br/>\n<br/>\nlyla<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48087,"nextTopicId":47616}}
