If<br/>\nyou feel that you are just plodding through your life and the kids are bored<br/>\nand not being exposed to their world, go ahead and schedule the<br/>\nactivities.....just don&#39;t schedule them for the kids, schedule them for you.<br/>\nDo interesting things FOR YOU, that YOU like.  Of course, ask the kids if<br/>\nthey want to play or come with you....but do it FOR YOU.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your house is anything like my house, you can&#39;t do anything solo<br/>\nanyway....somebody is always asking to help, to find out what you are doing<br/>\nand why, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nI truly believe that to &quot;get&quot; unschooling for your kids, you first have to<br/>\n&quot;get&quot; it for you.  What have you always wanted to do but never had the time<br/>\nor the money or whatever?  Organic gardening?  flying lessons?  karate?<br/>\nvolunteer as a fireman?  have your own dairy?  holistic medicine?  Those are<br/>\ntopics that my kids know a great deal about because they are interests of<br/>\nmine and my dh.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps you want to make homemade soap, learn to sew, learn to weld, write a<br/>\nbook, do calligraphy, paint, whatever.  Schedule YOU some time and do it.<br/>\nOnce you quit worrying so much about what the kids are learning and start<br/>\nlearning yourself.......you will be amazed.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6735,"nextTopicId":6759}}
