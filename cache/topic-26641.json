Things  <br/>\nhappen when you make the choice to DO it - when kids are trusted,  <br/>\nthey change, for example.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a great quote someone posted to my state list that I think is  <br/>\nrelevant:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back,<br/>\nalways ineffectiveness. Concerning all acts of initiative (and creation)<br/>\nthere is one elementary truth, the ignorance of which kills countless<br/>\nideas and splendid plans: that the moment one definitely commits<br/>\noneself, then Providence moves too. All sorts of things occur to help<br/>\none that would never otherwise have occurred. A whole stream of events<br/>\nissues from the decision, raising in one&#39;s favor all manner of<br/>\nunforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance, which no man<br/>\ncould have dreamed would have come his way.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\n<br/>\nThe author is<br/>\nWilliam Hutchinson Murray and here is a blurb from Wikipedia&#39;s<br/>\narticle about him. For the entire article, see: &lt;http://<br/>\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._H._Murray&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the outbreak of WWII, he joined the Argyll and Sutherland<br/>\nHighlanders and was posted to the Middle East and north Africa where<br/>\nhe was captured during the Western Desert Campaign. He then spent<br/>\nthree years in Prisoner of War camps in Italy (Chieti), Germany<br/>\n(Moosberg, Brunswick) and Czechoslovakia (Marisch Trubeau Oflag VIII-<br/>\nF). While imprisoned, wrote a book entitled Mountaineering In<br/>\nScotland. The first draft of the work was written on the only paper<br/>\navailable to him - rough toilet paper. The manuscript was found and<br/>\ndestroyed by the Gestapo. To the incredulity of his fellow prisoners,<br/>\nMurray&#39;s response to the loss was to start again, despite the risk of<br/>\nits loss and that his physical condition was so poor from the near<br/>\nstarvation diet that he believed he would never climb again. The<br/>\nrewritten work was finally published in 1947 and was followed by the<br/>\nsequel, Undiscovered Scotland in 1951. Both concentrate on Scottish<br/>\nwinter climbing and were widely credited with helping to inspire the<br/>\npost-war renaissance in the sport. Though written in an evocative,<br/>\nrather pantheistic, style, somewhat too romantic for modern tastes,<br/>\nthey are of significant literary value.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26609,"nextTopicId":26622}}
