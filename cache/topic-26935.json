Boy and I glad I went &quot;No Mail&quot; cuz I would<br/>\nfeel like I have to read every digest I received while I was gone...lol  I<br/>\nwon&#39;t go into details here (will write in my blog when I have more time) but<br/>\nI highly recommend people start planning to attend next years Rethinking<br/>\nEducation (www.rethinkingeducation.com) conference NOW!  It was soooo<br/>\nwonderful to be surrounded by parents and grandparents (and hotel staff)<br/>\nthat have the utmost respect for children.
