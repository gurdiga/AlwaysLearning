I hate it, she hates it, we don&#39;t like to do it, and it doesn&#39;t get done.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it pisses me off because I&#39;m working all day out of the house to make sure she can stay at home and unschool, and I think she should be willing and wanting to help out by doing some small chores.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther times, I realize I don&#39;t want her to remember how her life as an unschooler involved fights with mom about housework and housework itself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a constant battle, in my own head, to find the balance.  I wish I could afford someone to come in and do the housework once a week.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut no, there is no rebellion.  She wants a piercing.  In her lip.  I&#39;m OK with it, we&#39;ll do some research and get it done right, and I&#39;m OK with it.  I&#39;ve asked her to wait until the divorce is final, it&#39;s a reasonable request...  Her clothing choices are interesting... lots of skulls and black and red, and arm warmers, from a store called Hot Topic, it&#39;s kinda cute.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t make any rules for her to defy.  We discuss things, such as how to keep her safe on line, and she and I have, I guess you could say, come up with guidelines.  But it&#39;s really her and I talking about it, and Alexx using her brain to tell me how she will stay safe (not giving out personal information, mostly).  She doesn&#39;t have to rebel, we can talk about it and come to a conclusion.  For instance, with laundry today she didn&#39;t want to help so she asked if I&#39;d stay down at the laundry mat, and she&#39;d help me take it down there, and then come help me fold it.  It&#39;s kinda like we are partners.  She respects my experience, I respect her insight, her wisdom.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe makes really good decisions and choices. I don&#39;t think she will &quot;rebel.&quot;  I needed to, as a teen.  I was controlled and restricted and ruled to tears.  I had to follow rules at school and at home and everywhere.  I rarely got to decide when I woke up, or when I went to sleep, what I wore, what I learned, etc. etc.  I was controlled 90% of the time.  My teen has control over her life, and she makes her own decisions, with my assistance, and me to help when she needs it.

We have done the co-sleeping thing (you&#39;ll squash him) the longer term breast feeding thing (He&#39;s not still nursing!! He&#39;s 3 years old!!) and then we did the sell the house and move into a bus thing. Í was terrified in the lead up to telling them about this one. I was prepared for major disapproval and was dumbfounded to receive a supportive and non-interfering response. Basically they said that it wasn&#39;t what they would choose to do but if it&#39;s what we choose to do then that was OK with them. I think my Dad has had a bit of a chat with my Mum regarding the role of grandparents (i.e. don&#39;t interfere, it&#39;s their life) because it truly was not the reaction I was anticipating. The most recent change has been about homeschooling  I sent my parents an email (as we live in bus and have very expensive mobile phone rates here in New Zealand) telling them that we were continuing to homeschool even though we have settled somewhere for a year or two and have schools available close by. A few weeks later the boys and I went to visit. Not a word of censure. Not a word at all about what we are doing. Bliss. Luckily we are not the first in the family to be homeschooling, although how we homeschool is rather different from my brother and his family!! (I haven&#39;t discussed the how of it with my parents,  i.e. unschooling. I think it would be too much too soon. I&#39;m not going to shy away from talking about unschooling, however, I shall pick my moments - I&#39;ll look for what I used to call &#39;teachable moments&#39; Dunno what to call them now!! Learnable moments??).<br/>\n:) Libby<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: relatives, changes, and why we can unschool","postDate":"1207530313","msgId":34088,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI2NDRFQUNFLThGRkItNDVENy1BRkVDLUYzNDU0NTIyMUZBNEBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDkwZjQ4NzU2MDgwNDA2MTM1Mm41MDg5MTM1Zng3NzUzMGFkMWEzNTg3NDNjQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDM3QjY3NTQ0LUI1MDUtNDQyQy1BMEY4LUMwOTJFRDJDMUYxMUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDIwMDgwNDA2MTYzMDUwLjFMT0IzLjEzNjk1OC5yb290QGZlcHdlYjEzPiA8OTBmNDg3NTYwODA0MDYxMzUybjUwODkxMzVmeDc3NTMwYWQxYTM1ODc0M2NAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":34087,"nextInTopic":34090,"prevInTime":34087,"nextInTime":34089,"topicId":34058,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

They do not have my life, my children, my background, my chaos-theory of life, and therefore why be threathened or feel the need to draw that LINE in the sand?  I allow the ebb and flow of flotsam and jetsum to wash away the line, and leave them with only enough information to keep them thinking, and not enough to leave them judging.  It is essentially not anyone else&#39;s business what my decisions are......I have had to deal with questioning about natural birthing, home birthing, extended breastfeeding, family bed, no vaccines, homeschooling, now unschooling.  If I felt the need to PROVE my point, or validate my choices, I would be exhausted.  Channel the energy THAT takes into what you feel you are doing that IS right, IS good and IS life-affirming with your family.  (your kids)  <br/>\n<br/>\nWill it really matter anyway in 10 years, this proving??  NO.  But it absolutely DOES dillute your ability to BE present and to FEEL right about your choices, when you are in the defensive mode.  Forget it.  Of course we all want others to approve, to applaud, to agree, to share with us the wonderful things that happen precisely BECAUSE of our choices, but there will be only a few who will be there in this regard.  It could be that they will only be found on lists like this! :)Remember the value of your siblings, uncles, moms, grandmothers etc........those relationships have never been about your children.  Your relationships with these people were created before you had children, before you ever gave thought to the choices before you.  It is a separate box, that when opened up can give you great joy.  This may mean that you don&#39;t leave your kids with grandma, but that does not take away YOUR relationship with your mom.  I have found that if I let all my relationships bleed into eachother, none would be the personal relationships that they are today.  Sometimes it takes some juggling, and I have found it worth it to juggle--a great art I am learning to use for my benefit.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKelley<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandandstardust.blogspot.com/\">http://sandandstardust.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Childhood is a journey, not a race.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":180234378,"authorName":"Sylvia Toyama","from":"&quot;Sylvia Toyama&quot; &lt;sylgt04@...&gt;","profile":"sylgt04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: relatives, changes, and why we can unschool","postDate":"1207447694","msgId":34068,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZ0OWJhZStmMDA0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZ0OGdpdCtjZWlvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":34067,"nextInTopic":34069,"prevInTime":34067,"nextInTime":34069,"topicId":34058,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Things that promote peace are preferable to other.

Some people are<br/>\ncruel in breaking off with relatives, and it would be nice to bring<br/>\nideas for things that are less hurtful rather than more, though in<br/>\nsome cases the hurt seems deserved.<br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\nKindness in breaking things off is preferable.  This, for me, has <br/>\nbeen a softening of perspective, a recognition on my part that trying <br/>\nto insisting someone accept me as I am, just because they&#39;re related <br/>\nto me, isn&#39;t peaceful.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I received the letter from my Mom, I replied with a genuine <br/>\nexpression that I&#39;m glad she&#39;s found her path to peace, and wished <br/>\nher the best.  I can and do forgive the painful parts of our past.  I <br/>\ndo believe that parents always strive to do the best they can -- it <br/>\nmay not be the best they know, but I have to trust that in the <br/>\nmoment, it was the best she could do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAn important lesson for me years ago -- in my 20&#39;s when my Dad and I <br/>\nwere estranged -- was that I can forgive, but still not desire <br/>\nrelationship today.  Growing up, I had the sense that letting go of <br/>\npast hurts meant I had to embrace and welcome that person into my <br/>\nlife.  It&#39;s all about setting boundaries.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy Dad and I have a relationship now.  He lives in the same city, so <br/>\nhe knows we homeschool, but unschool&#39;s not a word he&#39;s ever heard.  <br/>\nNot because I&#39;m amashed of how we live, but because it&#39;s not <br/>\nnecessary for him to know how we live day-to-day.  He and I have very <br/>\ndifferent opinions and values, and after years of disagreeing <br/>\n(loudly) with him, I realize it&#39;s easier -- and kinder to us both -- <br/>\nto just leave those topics alone.  He trusts that I will always do my <br/>\nbest by my kids, and interprets best in his way.  It never occurs to <br/>\nhim to ask me how we do things.  Telling him what we&#39;re about, and <br/>\ninsisting he accept those ideas, would only invite disagreement, <br/>\nwhich doesn&#39;t promote the kind of atmosphere we want for our kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe only recently talked about unschooling with my husband&#39;s parents.  <br/>\nThey&#39;ve known we homeschool since 2001, when we began, but when we <br/>\nstarted unschooling in 2003, there was no need to share details.  As <br/>\nthe boys have grown, and their relationship with their grandparents <br/>\nhas grown, it is helpful for them to know more about our lifestyle.  <br/>\nThey&#39;ve been very supportive -- they always are, really -- and gentle <br/>\nin how they ask questions of us.  Being open with them -- and not <br/>\ndefensive or demanding they understand us -- is a really good thing <br/>\nfor us all. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe situation with my Mom is different in that her argument isn&#39;t <br/>\nwith the academics of unschooling, but rather with the freedom of <br/>\nrespectful parenting.  She is convinced that my choices as a Mom are <br/>\nreactionary, and to her it feels like a slap in the face to see me <br/>\ndoing things so differently.  Yes, 23 yrs ago when I became a Mom the <br/>\nonly tool in my kit was to do things the opposite from her methods, <br/>\nand it was reactionary.  Not a negative thing, given how I&#39;d felt all <br/>\nmy childhood, but I wasn&#39;t loving enough towards her.  I was still <br/>\ntoo angry, too hurt, and I wanted her to see I was right (and that <br/>\nshe had been wrong), to accept me for who I am.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOver the years, my path has become less reactionary, yet still <br/>\nfarther from hers. Now I&#39;m healed enough to not feel a need to have <br/>\nher see that I&#39;m right.  I&#39;m confident in the way we live and parent <br/>\nour children.  I think my confidence is even harder for her. When I <br/>\nwas reacting and demanding acceptance, she could discredit my choices <br/>\nby saying I was just getting back at her.  She&#39;s chosen to break off <br/>\nfrom me, which suits me fine since she was lashing out at my kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nLately, I&#39;ve been reminded of something my Mom told me years ago, <br/>\nduring my divorce.  She said that kindness is sign of strenght or <br/>\npower -- the more power one has, the kinder one can afford to be.  <br/>\nHer point was that the reason my ex was so outraged talking to me is <br/>\nthat I could be calm because I was stronger, and he could sense my <br/>\nconfidence meant he had lost power.  She was right -- sometimes the <br/>\nmore confident we are, the more others oppose us.  Funny how the same <br/>\nhas proven to be true in my relationship with her. <br/>\n<br/>\nSylvia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: relatives, changes, and why we can unschool","postDate":"1207444292","msgId":34067,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZ0OTgwNCt1OXZhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGMxMzQ4ODI4MDgwNDA1MTU1OXczYmM0ZGMyMXZjMzBkMWQ5ZTBhYThlNGNmQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":34066,"nextInTopic":34068,"prevInTime":34066,"nextInTime":34068,"topicId":34058,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~Grandma wanted to give dd a zoo experience, but only on Grandma s terms.

Since learning this, I&#39;ve been able to apply that to other relationships--and when I <br/>\nremember too, it&#39;s always better to have more patience.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":143043046,"authorName":"Ed Wendell","from":"&quot;Ed Wendell&quot; &lt;ewendell@...&gt;","profile":"zelco123","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] relatives, changes, and why we can unschool","postDate":"1207409161","msgId":34061,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIzNERFMTI1MjBCRDQ4Q0Q4NjYxNURCNzYxQzQ0MDgzQEVkUEM+","inReplyToHeader":"PDg3MDY1RERBLTE1OTEtNDE3RC1BMTIyLTIxQzFFRDFEQzJBM0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDcwOEY2NTJFLUMzNDMtNEY4Ni05N0U3LUZEMTY2REU5MDU4RUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDgzRjVGNEVGN0EyRDREQTY4RUQ1OEE3MUNFNDk3RjVGQEVkUEM+IDw4NzA2NUREQS0xNTkxLTQxN0QtQTEyMi0yMUMxRUQxREMyQTNAc2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":34060,"nextInTopic":34062,"prevInTime":34060,"nextInTime":34062,"topicId":34058,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"info-wo-fro ?
