I&#39;ve recently discovered a good trick.  I<br/>\nused to crumple newspaper and put the kindling on that.  Then I&#39;d add bigger<br/>\nwood once the kindling was going.  Trouble with that is I&#39;d either forget<br/>\nabout it or manage to choke off the fire with the big wood.  Now I put in<br/>\ntwo chunks (all that will fit side by side) with the newspaper in the middle<br/>\nand the kindling kind of on top of it all but mostly on the paper.  Works<br/>\nlike a charm.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeeping it going all night isn&#39;t too hard.  I just fill it up and shut the<br/>\ndraft almost all the way.  Depending on the wood, it usually lasts until<br/>\nmorning.  The glitch is when the fire is at a certain stage when I want to<br/>\ngo to bed.  If it&#39;s really hot and glowing, adding wood or disturbing it<br/>\ntends to send sparks and even chunks of coals flying out.  I just leave it<br/>\nwhen it&#39;s like that and hope I remember to feed it later when I get up for a<br/>\npee.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s one of those things that I&#39;ve *always* known about - which means I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t rightly remember wherefrom!

We&#39;re going to have to choose one in the next few weeks and the whole <br/>\ncatalytic/not catalytic, outside air intake/inside air intake, etc <br/>\nquestions are kind of giving me pause.  We&#39;ll only need the very smallest <br/>\nsize to heat a 21&#39; round room, mostly on weekends at the moment, full-time <br/>\nin a few years.  I&#39;ve heard that catalytic stoves are a pain in the rear <br/>\nand lose a lot of therms in the process, and the ceramics are expensive and <br/>\nhighly breakable.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor living lightly, we&#39;re working on converting my big ol&#39; truck Betsy to <br/>\nBiodiesel (made ourselves from FREE used cooking oil from restaurants, and <br/>\nwill cost us about 50 cents/gallon! (not including start-up <br/>\nequipment.)  That beats $2.30/gallon anyday!)  We&#39;re busy trying to find <br/>\nall the things we&#39;ll need (and switch out the rubber fuel hoses for <br/>\nsynthetic!) so we&#39;re not up and running yet, but hopefully in the next few <br/>\nweeks.  When we get her going, she&#39;ll become my main transport.  I&#39;ll smell <br/>\nlike French Fries as I putter down the highway!  ...or maybe sushi...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd does anybody know how polluting propane is (to manufacture and end <br/>\nuse)?
