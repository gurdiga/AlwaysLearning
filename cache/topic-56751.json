I posted it first. I&#39;d read it somewhere shortly after an online exchange of views in which I&#39;d explained why my son&#39;s removal from school was a parenting decision not an educational one and that his happiness was the primary objective. I thought Joyce&#39;s words summarised my thoughts about that very well, but of course that was in the context of my thoughts about that. Given that only I knew the details of that exchange of views elsewhere I can see Joyce&#39;s words were indeed out of context.<br/>\n<br/>\nBob</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] The goal of unschooling (and how to screw it up)","postDate":"1281381829","msgId":56752,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQ0Q0I5QjFCLTc5NzUtNEI4Mi04RDZELTMxQjJBRUE5NjUxNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDYyRUM2ODMyLTNGOUMtNDQ5OC05QTg3LTJBOTdENjcyNEVBRUBTYW5kcmFEb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDYyRUM2ODMyLTNGOUMtNDQ5OC05QTg3LTJBOTdENjcyNEVBRUBTYW5kcmFEb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":56751,"nextInTopic":56758,"prevInTime":56751,"nextInTime":56753,"topicId":56751,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I think when unschooling works well, learning is a side effect of everything.
