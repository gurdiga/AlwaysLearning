Ben is Marty&#39;s &quot;squire  <br/>\nbrother&quot; (they&#39;re both squired to the same knight in the SCA), and a  <br/>\nstudent of mine (SCA context also).  He and Holly are good friends  <br/>\nand we got to go to his wedding a  year and a half ago in Silver City.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one behind Marty is Holly&#39;s special friend.  If you know Kirby  <br/>\nand it occurs to you that Brett looks kind of like Kirby somehow,  <br/>\nyou&#39;re right.  We can all see it.  They have similarities of  <br/>\npersonality and behavior too.  So Holly&#39;s not looking for her dad, in  <br/>\na man, it seems.  Maybe she&#39;s looking for her oldest brother.   (And  <br/>\nBrett was Kirby&#39;s friend before any of the rest of us met him too,  <br/>\nfrom the realm of table gaming, CCGs, or whatever, a few years back.)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who don&#39;t know Holly&#39;s photoshop proclivities, some of her  <br/>\nstuff is also here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/holly\">http://sandradodd.com/holly</a><br/>\n<br/>\nCameras and computers have been very very good to Holly.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32215,"nextTopicId":32240}}
