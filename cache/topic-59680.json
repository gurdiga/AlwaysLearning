Talking about food can make her frustrated and lead to refusal of even things she likes.  Better for me to notice if she&#39;s hungry or likely to get hungry and put some things out.  Small amounts of sweet, savory, salty mostly healthy stuff and once she&#39;s eaten a bit of food she is much more able to express what she wants to eat next.

Two of these sets of parents have used time-out in my house (taking the child to a spare room in our house) once before. I am strongly opposed to time-out and found it really upsetting to see both children (on separate occasions) being treated this way - both were distraught when it happened. I tried to diffuse the tension of the situations and talk to the parents, framing the childrens&#39; behaviour in a different way for the parents so that they weren&#39;t just seen as being &#39;naughty&#39; and &#39;deserving&#39; of time-out, and helping to calm the parents down so they weren&#39;t so angry. I also made an effort to be kind with the children after the event. However, I didn&#39;t speak out against the parents using our &#39;space&#39; to enforce the time-out and didn&#39;t stop it from happening. Some of the other posts recently (to do with speaking up or choosing to/not to intervene with other people&#39;s parenting etc.) have got me thinking about these situations again and what I would do if it came up in the future. I understand that these friends parent differently from me but I also feel that when it comes to my house, I am very uncomfortable and unhappy about someone treating their children that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would really appreciate any suggestions or thoughts from other people on how they would handle a situation like this.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnn-Marie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Making requested Food Which is then Rejected","postDate":"1297894553","msgId":59805,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVDNzI0MEQ1LUM3NTEtNEJFNS1CMzUzLUJENzIyRkVENTk5QkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlqaDY1MithOHFkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlqaDY1MithOHFkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":59803,"nextInTopic":59823,"prevInTime":59804,"nextInTime":59806,"topicId":59680,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I added the part about my MIL because it is another illustration of how controlling traditional parenting can be, even when we re adults.

We usually go shopping in the evening on a Sunday or Monday, and he and his brother, 2, will stay up later than usual sampling the various weekly provisions. I have to catch myself when I get frustrated about it. One little inner voice is saying, <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;This food is supposed to last all week! And they&#39;re not even going to finish what they open because they&#39;re not even that hungry! And I&#39;m here trying to put all the groceries AWAY and there they are pulling everything back OUT! Waaaa!&quot; (In my house, I *am* the [former] public school teacher, and boy, does this action threaten my [former, but deep!] ideas of &quot;control.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nRight about the &quot;Waaaa&quot; time--luckily!--my other little voice, the one that&#39;s been paying attention to this list and other very helpful radical unschooling websites, and who has lovely unschooly mantras memorized for just such occasions, pipes in. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Look how TANTALIZING the fridge looks full of all that food! It&#39;s all their favorite meals IN ONE PLACE, AT THE SAME TIME! There really is something great about experiencing harvest, bounty, plenty, etc. So, let&#39;s see what they&#39;re really trying to do, and see how we can help.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, bowls of yogurt, half-finished. The rest can go in tomorrow morning&#39;s smoothies.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe banana that wasn&#39;t actually ripe enough to eat, but that looked darn tasty, and is now abandoned with one bite out. That&#39;s OK, too. Smoothies, in the morning, or maybe frozen for later.<br/>\n<br/>\nOpening the bag of carrots and feeding them to the dog. Hmmm. I can cut up one carrot into sticks, and this activity can go on, but with me saving the rest of the bag.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt some point, I might rattle off a list to them. &quot;You&#39;ve had yogurt, banana, carrots, bread, and mango slices. I was thinking raisins might top off this late-night meal nicely. What do you think?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the whys can be complicated. For my boys, I think there is a scarcity/abundance thing going on. So, I&#39;m trying to move away from weekly shopping in favor of replacing their favorite snacks right when they&#39;re gone to minimize their frustration at staring in an empty fridge when they&#39;re not the one with the means to fill it. And now that I think about it, I might try one of the suggestions that you got, and just lay out a smorgasbord on the main shopping day as I&#39;m putting away groceries. Choice is a pretty empowering thing, and so is experiencing food security, and so is having an adult in your life who&#39;s willing to help you fill needs that you can&#39;t really fill for yourself. <br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Amy&quot; &lt;amyterese0303@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thank you all for your insight.

There are many reasons for thinking he wanted it until he saw it in front of him and then changing his mind suddenly. It could have beenbecause of smell, taste, texture or just mood. He would also like things cooked a certain way. Grilled cheese could not be too grilled. Scrambled eggs had to be square (did this once and he would not eat them any other way). Burgers could not have any pink, but no burned spots either. There were many of these things, but I always just went with the flow and listened to my son. He would go over to grandma&#39;s house or stay home with my husband and they would &quot;cook it wrong&quot; many times. They would get frustrated, but I never did. I would just explain that he was going through a phase of sudden changes and also of being particular with food. I never saw him as wasting food or my time (I find constant joy in cooking for him even if he does change his mind). He wasn&#39;t trying to be bad or picky or grouchy. He wasn&#39;t grouchy really even though when he was 3 he would proclaim things as &quot;yucky&quot; (at that age I let most thing like that slide). <br/>\n<br/>\nI think food issues usually resolve themselves when given space and understanding. Today at age 10 (almost 11), my son isn&#39;t particular about how things are cooked any longer and doesn&#39;t ever tell me anything is &quot;yucky&quot;. He tries most foods even if he doesn&#39;t like them! He is particular about types of foods, but has given up on the other things. He also doesn&#39;t ever change his mind about food anymore! I never made a big deal out of the entire thing and he simply changed again. I think part of this is due to the fact that he is more aware now of his tastes and also more aware of his feelings/desires. <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra says, &quot;Read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is perfect here.

My dd5yo often asks for a specific food item to be made for her, and then when it is placed before her she says she doesn&#39;t want it, and wants something else. This has been very frustrating for me and I really need some experienced advice about what to do in this situation. In the past, I have made her eat the first thing she requested, explaining that to ask someone to make something for you and then refuse to eat it is rude and doesn&#39;t show respect for the person who is making the food. Tonight she did this again and I took the original food away and gave her the item she requested instead. These are not unusual foods. I&#39;m talking about macaroni and cheese, yogurt, etc. Things she&#39;s very familiar with and knows how they taste. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt feels right not to force her to eat food that she doesn&#39;t want to eat, but what about the wasted food and the respect for other people&#39;s time? She doesn&#39;t only do this with me, but also with her dad, gma and auntie.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould someone please help me see this in an unschooly way? I&#39;m at a loss.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59702,"nextTopicId":59897}}
