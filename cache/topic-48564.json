My son is diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome(on the autism spectrum) and I dreaded all the times I was approached by others about considering these dietary restrictions. It is so popular that I found myself doubting my own instincts that where telling me not to restrict. All the hype about GFCG would have you think that those of us who don&#39;t buy into it are just lazy parents. Having the freedom to enjoy this life without others trying to control any of it is for my son and I what unschooling is all about. <br/>\n <br/>\nThank you again Andrea for helping me lift one more burden off of my shoulders so that I can take that energy and put it towards my wonderfully &quot;spirited&quot; son .<br/>\n <br/>\nBe free,<br/>\n <br/>\nMary<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48501,"nextTopicId":48573}}
