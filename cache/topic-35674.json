As<br/>\na rule the kids each automatically had $5 to spend on (generally one) book,<br/>\nunless they&#39;d brought any extra pocket money.  It was great to watch them<br/>\ndevelop strategies for picking that one book each week, and see if they&#39;d<br/>\nput it aside after paying for it (and use the time there to look at other<br/>\nbooks) or if they couldn&#39;t resist and dove in immediately. For a while we<br/>\nran into some of the same people regularly (an older lady and her two grown<br/>\ndaughters, a dad with a toddler who was at first shy with my kids, then<br/>\nwould dance on the aisle with them as soon as the music started). When the<br/>\nmusicians were done and packing up, my kids would go up to talk to them<br/>\nwhile I paid for our books.
