(wow.. that was hard <br/>\nto spit out....!)  Anyway...  I read the letter the first time and <br/>\nthought... oh man, I am being set up big time.. then I read it again <br/>\nand thought... ok, she is being open... maybe I could say <br/>\nsomething...  I read it to my husband... (he just grinned...)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think she really just wants to tell me that she has a really smart <br/>\nlittle boy and (as she should!) be very proud of him! I wrote to her <br/>\nand sorta blew off much of her point and recmdedd John Holt&#39;s <br/>\nLearning all the time... I said that with all kids born wanting to <br/>\naborb everything Holt believes that we should run with their <br/>\ninterests!  It is great that she sees that he craves learning...  <br/>\nAny... any other books that you would rec to her along the lines as <br/>\nto what she is talking about?   My dh suggested The Hurried <br/>\nChild....  (still grinning of course...)<br/>\n<br/>\nthoughts?  here is her letter<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s (her son 17 months) a pretty exceptional little boy.  Since <br/>\nyou&#39;re so into home schooling I&#39;m sure you have lots of resources.  <br/>\nWould you mind taking a few minutes and helping me find some.  I know <br/>\nevery mother says this but I swear Noah&#39;s IQ must be huge.  I taught <br/>\nhim how to count to ten already, and now we&#39;re working on the <br/>\nalphabet (after just a few sessions he&#39;s already showing some <br/>\nmemorization).  He&#39;s also recognizing most of his colors and all of <br/>\nhis body parts even the hard ones.  I just feel like he&#39;s learning <br/>\neverything so quickly that I don&#39;t want to slow down.  He&#39;s really <br/>\nenjoying it so where can I go from here.  Are there books that I can <br/>\nread to help me deal with an exceptional child?  My mother says I&#39;m <br/>\npushing him too hard but I feel like he&#39;s pushing me to learn new <br/>\nthings.  John agrees with me that Luke has a true love of learning.  <br/>\nWhat do you think can you push a kid too hard when they are the <br/>\ninstigator?  If you can just point me in the direction of some <br/>\nliterature I&#39;ll be sure to read it.  <br/>\nThanks a million,<br/>\nShauna<br/>\nHey are you still home schooling?  I was just curious to know if this <br/>\nwas a permanent situation or what.  Obviously if you are it&#39;s working <br/>\nwell for you but let me know because I&#39;m curious how it works with <br/>\ntwo kids of different ages</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17455,"nextTopicId":17456}}
