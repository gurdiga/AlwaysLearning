First from the office <br/>\nasking why I allowed both my girls to stay home yesterday and spend <br/>\nthe day with me. I informed them that with my work sec. it was the <br/>\nonly time I had to see them, and entire family took days off work <br/>\next. write them down excused parent or sick  (call it mommy iddess, <br/>\nwitch ever I didn&#39;t care)<br/>\n  Then the next was from my Daughter in tears again. We had gotten <br/>\nher hair cut yesterday and the girls where making fun of her writing <br/>\non the bathroom walls and so forth. Even threatened to kill her again <br/>\nand beat her up, for getting her hair cut.<br/>\nI had had it. Daughter wanted to come home I told them release her <br/>\nthey said just because she is being picked on .I told them for get it <br/>\nI will be right there. I met daughter in hall and said you sure you <br/>\nwant to do this now she said please mom. We marched into the <br/>\nsuperintendent&#39;s office asked for the paper work was asked why and I <br/>\nre told them why. They gave me the paper work and we went to the <br/>\nlocker and cleaned it out. Turned in the books and said we are done.<br/>\n    So now here is my dilemma on the paper work it says I have to <br/>\nhave special permission it reads:<br/>\nNo. #8. If the child is currently identified as a child requiring in <br/>\nspecial education prior approval must be sought from the special <br/>\neducation director at the Area Education Agency if this is the first <br/>\nyear that the child will be receiving Competent Privet instruction in <br/>\nIowa. Iowa code section 200A.9<br/>\n  If she had a IEP is she one that needs special permission?<br/>\nI told her she didn&#39;t have to go back. And I will not lie to her. <br/>\nNext Monday is nest day during the day I have off and will make a <br/>\ntrip to the homeschool in Kolona and see if I can transfer her there, <br/>\nand bypass it all. But thought I would inform here to progress. And <br/>\nask for advice.<br/>\nDee</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13987,"nextTopicId":13939}}
