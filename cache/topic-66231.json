This is<br/>\nalso important for me to keep in mind, because I tend to become very<br/>\nemotional in these situations, so it&#39;ll be calming for me to remember that<br/>\nwhat matters is that we&#39;ll all be together and well. In that sense, it was<br/>\nalso important for me to read the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n««Take pictures of the old house that she can look at when she&#39;s older, but<br/>\ndon&#39;t dwell on them now.»»<br/>\n<br/>\nI was already imagining myself taking the pictures and then looking at<br/>\nthem, feeling sad and teary, and having Constança remember the old house<br/>\nand stressing, etc., so it was helpful to read Sandra&#39;s suggestion. We&#39;ll<br/>\ntake pictures and then save them for a rainy day when we feel like going<br/>\ndown memory lane. Humm, then again maybe not - we&#39;ll save them for a sunny<br/>\nday and do something fun with them like printing and making an album, while<br/>\nwe fondly remember our life here. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about the move and the new house, and even<br/>\nthough I feel we&#39;re lucky to be able to do this very gently (we won&#39;t sell<br/>\nthe house we&#39;re in until we&#39;re already living in the new house, and we&#39;re<br/>\ngoing to &quot;rent&quot; the new one for a couple of months before actually buying<br/>\nit, which gives us enough time to do everything really slowly and gently),<br/>\nI&#39;d like to share with you some of the ideas I&#39;ve had to see if they make<br/>\nsense and ask for some more, if possible:<br/>\n<br/>\n- I was thinking that since we can already start taking our stuff into the<br/>\nnew house, maybe we could do it slowly and on one occasion or another take<br/>\nConstança so she can see the house and start to get familiar with it. Maybe<br/>\ntake a ball, a toy or a game for us to start playing there, and have<br/>\nsomething fun associated with the house.<br/>\n- Maybe it would be better to leave her toys and her things for last and<br/>\ntake them on the the day of the move. I also thought it might be best if we<br/>\n(Constança and I) spent the day with her step-sister and her aunt (she<br/>\nloves being with both of them), only coming home at the end of the day,<br/>\nwhen everything will already be at the new house. Then maybe having a fun<br/>\ndinner all together and asking her step-sister to stay with us for a day or<br/>\ntwo (Beatriz is 14 years old, she&#39;s Bruno daughter from a previous<br/>\nrelationship and she&#39;s only with us every other weekend, at best).<br/>\n- As I&#39;ve already said before and following Sandra&#39;s suggestion, I was also<br/>\nthinking of taking pictures of the old house and even making a small movie,<br/>\na kind of documentary, registering funny/interesting/curious things about<br/>\nour street, our building, our house and the little details that we loved.<br/>\n- My husband and I also thought of buying some new gadget or toy for her<br/>\nand give it to her on the day we actually move into the new house, so she<br/>\ncan get all excited and maybe distracted from the big moment.<br/>\n- And thinking about having a little treat for her, I&#39;ll be sure to have a<br/>\nlot of food and snacks that she likes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll have to think about Beatriz too (we&#39;re already going to paint her<br/>\nroom, as she asked us to, and we&#39;ll buy her something special too), but I<br/>\nbelieve the situation is different, since she&#39;s older and won&#39;t be living<br/>\nwith us anyway. But I can tell you this: thanks to this list and the people<br/>\nwho generously share with us their radically unschooled lives, we&#39;re going<br/>\nto buy a bigger house with a room just for Beatriz (a few months ago, I<br/>\nthink I probably wouldn&#39;t have looked for a house with 3 bedrooms, thinking<br/>\nshe could sleep in the living room - now, I see how important it is for<br/>\nBeatriz to have her own room, even if she only spends one weekend with us<br/>\nfor the rest of her life!), which ties in with another unforeseen benefit<br/>\nof reading, thinking and talking about radical unschooling - the way our<br/>\nrelationship with my step-daughter has changed for the better. Bruno and I<br/>\nare still working on it, but I believe there&#39;s much more mindfulness in our<br/>\nthoughts, words and actions towards her. Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that&#39;s it for now.<br/>\nMarta<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":464212763,"authorName":"Miliana","from":"Miliana &lt;milianajohnson@...&gt;","profile":"milianajohnson","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Helping Kids through Changes","postDate":"1332193747","msgId":66274,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEIzOUQyQTY1LTVDNzAtNDVDOC05NUQ0LTAwQ0U3QUE2QzZCNkB5YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":66253,"nextInTopic":66549,"prevInTime":66273,"nextInTime":66275,"topicId":66231,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We ll be moving soon, as well.

Any change bothers her. And this is huge. <br/>\n<br/>\nI understand enough not to try and tell her how great it will be to be in a (insert any positive adjective here) house, but beyond that I&#39;m not sure how to ease the transition for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo give an idea of where she is coming from: we replaced two old, ugly, worn, hand-me-down love seats with a sectional sofa that we can all snuggle up on together. She spent hours crying, sucking her thumb (though she had never once sucked her thumb before), and bouncing on the love seats the night we put them on the curb. Two years later she will still say, &quot;I like the new sofa, but I miss the old ones.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish there were a way we could just buy a new house and move in before we had to sell this one. Not that it would make her miss this one less, but I think pulling up old carpets, painting walls, etc. (all the things we need to do to this house to get it ready to sell) is just going to add to the trauma for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I know what the problem is, I just don&#39;t know how to make it easier for her. Any suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nAngela in NJ<br/>\nwith Joseph, 9; Hannah, 7; and Miriam, 4</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66536,"nextTopicId":66544}}
