First, the safety of life, the hold my hand, slow down when you<br/>\neat, small pieces please, watch the street then cross, two hands on the<br/>\nscooter. At some point along the way, these little people really do know how<br/>\nto be responsible. I see it with Tessa, almost 3 on some things, alot with<br/>\nRiley, 5.5, and Ashley at almost 8 seems to know how to be in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now I was controlling Tessa. She is playing with homemade playdough we<br/>\ncooked up about 45 minutes ago. She wants to mix in more flour. I told her she<br/>\nhad enough. Why? Two reasons, I see a potential mess I get to clean up and she<br/>\nwill make the playdough too dry. My deal. I gave her more flour and told her<br/>\nsorry for not listening right away. <br/>\n<br/>\nControlling the kids seems to creep into our lives so easily. I hear parents<br/>\nall the time telling kids not to do this or that at the playground. Throwing<br/>\nsand yes, but climbing up the slide when no one else is playing on it does not<br/>\nseem reasonable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like this discussion,<br/>\n<br/>\nMary H. (who married an introvert and is still learning to respect his out<br/>\nside of the group needs). Makes it difficult sometimes to do exciting crowd<br/>\nactivities, like fairs and festivals, yet boy do we have fun on our own in the<br/>\nwoods and beaches. I also have learned to ts=ake the kids to group things with<br/>\nanother family and ask Tim if he wants to join us. No expectations.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9248,"nextTopicId":9314}}
