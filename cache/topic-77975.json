I would answer simply, and in direct response to her questions ( those are letters, oh letters put together tell us what sounds to make, etc). Over time, her fragmented knowledge about words, letters, and sounds led her to sounding out or asking about combinations (sh for example). These might be while I was nursing her sister, walking to the park, driving- it was really spontaneous and random. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe also had plenty of paper, paint, chalk and chalkboard,markers, magnets on the fridge etc laying around. She asked to go the library at least once a week for books, movies and computer games. We read to her LOTS. She started writing letters, trying to copy or spell and by four was able to start sounding new words or at least memorised many. She began to want to write. She also had a new computer with games and internet in her room at that age (2001 ish).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI realise this is not everyone&#39;s experience (my other two got there the same way, slightly later, but were more into math questions; multiplication and division type stuff, first) I wanted to say that for some kids, in a stimulating and responsive environment, with plenty of time for conversations and new experiences, sounding out or phoenetic reading might be fine. Audiotapes might be fine. My kids aren&#39;t loaded with baggage about math or reading and they learned quite a bit about both before we eventually sent them  to school. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it was patronising to answer their questions thoughtfully, or to provide them with many different types of storytelling,maths,arts etc. I have always thought giving part of the answer and letting them work on it was better, for them to own their learning- unless they wanted the whole thing explained by me and said so. I gave the info they asked for, didn&#39;t solve it for them. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs teens, they all love to read and spend time on ipad, laptops. They still ask to buy books on amazon every single week.
