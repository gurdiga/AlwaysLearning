We&#39;ve only been unschooling for three years, and <br/>\nused to go to these kind of places, but now have to drive pretty far to find a <br/>\n&quot;good&quot; teacher supply place. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n**Teachers used to drive from all over New Mexico to Albuquerque to get <br/>\nsupplies, and now anyone anywhere can get more, better and less expensive stuff off <br/>\nthe internet.Â  It&#39;s sad for me because that was something familiar to me and <br/>\nchange can be sad and nostalgia can be sweet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose places aren&#39;t needed the same way they once were.**<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past month I&#39;ve heard much the same conversation about art supply <br/>\nstores, hobby/model shops, and several other things I&#39;m not recalling right now. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the biggest thing that&#39;s been lost in this transition of much <br/>\ncommerce to online sales is some opportunity for kids to poke around and dabble in <br/>\nnew pursuits. In a physical store it&#39;s much easier to go in, look around at <br/>\neverything, maybe plan a future purchase, and then leave with just a loose crayon <br/>\nand two dice, or one small jar of model paint, or a new kneaded eraser. My <br/>\nkids poke around a lot in online stores, but that one little purchase entry <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t happen because shipping costs would exceed the purchase price.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the teacher supply stores, the online venues are SO much less <br/>\nsatisfying for unschoolers. The kids can&#39;t pick up the workbooks and leaf through them <br/>\nto find the one in a hundred that isn&#39;t lame and boring, and it&#39;s so much <br/>\nless interesting to look at the posters one screen at a time. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand - while several older teacher supply stores have gone out <br/>\nof business in the last decade in our corner of Chicagoland, there&#39;s a newer <br/>\none (5 years now) that is thriving and growing by adapting to what brings people <br/>\ninto a physical business instead of internet shopping. They stock a huge <br/>\nvariety of interesting games and puzzles, at least half of which have a sample <br/>\nopen and available to play and try out right there in the wide aisle. They carry <br/>\narts and crafts supplies in both small and large quantities. They offer a <br/>\nparty room with activities for various age kids - game time, arts and crafts, <br/>\nscience discovery, etc. They&#39;re courting teachers, homeschoolers, and just plain <br/>\nparents. It&#39;s a fun place.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************************<br/>\n See what&#39;s free at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29027,"nextTopicId":29226}}
