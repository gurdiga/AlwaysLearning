I&#39;m <br/>\ncanvassing a lot of unschooling/natural parenting forums in an <br/>\nattempt to get the word out about Teaching Drum.<br/>\n  By &quot;children&#39;s culture&quot; I mean a group of children with their own <br/>\nculture.  This happens wherever there are groups of children - they <br/>\nhave their own games, language, conflict-resolution techniques, ect.  <br/>\nWe are intentionally trying to foster this, and the difference <br/>\nbetween saying &quot;we just want more kids&quot; is that we know it&#39;s what <br/>\nour children need.  In school and in sports they are clustered into <br/>\npeer groups where they learn they need to compete for <br/>\nattention/acceptance.  But humans weren&#39;t evolved to learn this way.  <br/>\nIn the small clans where we evolved our natural learning styles <br/>\nchildren would spend their days with those older and younger than <br/>\nthem, following in the example of the older and providing a bridge <br/>\nfor the younger.  <br/>\n  Right now our school community (by the way - the &quot;school&quot; is quite <br/>\nunique, I might call it the most radical facilitated-unschooling <br/>\nexperience for adults that exists on this planet) is home to 3 <br/>\nchildren.  Already in their day-to-day play I can see how much more <br/>\ntuned in to each other they are (the 5 year old wants to learn much <br/>\nmore from the 6 year old than from any of the adults).  Right now <br/>\nthere are big gaps 2years-&gt;5 years-&gt;6 years-&gt;21 years.  Filling in <br/>\nthose gaps is key for the children&#39;s own fulfillment (having someone <br/>\nto guide and put their new learning to practice, and having guides <br/>\nof their own) and for the maturation of the community (for our <br/>\nfuture and because relationship with children brings us so much of <br/>\nour own learning and example).<br/>\n  The website I&#39;ve created goes into these concepts more, I <br/>\nencourage anyone curious to check it out <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.teachingdrum.org/childrensculture.htm)\">http://www.teachingdrum.org/childrensculture.htm)</a>, or to email me <br/>\nif you have any more questions @ <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cybrmarc21@...\">cybrmarc21@...</a>.<br/>\n-marcus<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ordinarily I wouldn&#39;t let school&#39;s intro e-mails through, but this  <br/>\n&gt; one is interesting.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not unschooling, but I thought some of the readers of this <br/>\n </span></blockquote>list  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; might appreciate it as an alternative school idea.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To Marcus, can you explain more what you mean by &quot;a growing  <br/>\n&gt; children&#39;s culture&quot;?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Teaching Drum&#39;s children&#39;s culture","postDate":"1200064783","msgId":31759,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRGRTE1OUM2LTc3RTAtNEY4QS05QTU2LTBFOUFFRkNEODU5REBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGZtN2w1NitscmhzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZtN2w1NitscmhzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":31758,"nextInTopic":31802,"prevInTime":31758,"nextInTime":31760,"topicId":31758,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ordinarily I wouldn t let school s intro e-mails through, but this one is interesting.
