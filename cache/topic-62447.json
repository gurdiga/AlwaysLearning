Indigo children. Gack. ***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last time I was reminded of indigo children, it was a much older sister referring to her much younger brother and one of his friends.  Here&#39;s the thing about those 2 kids, the younger brother is so damaged by his parent&#39;s psychosis that he can&#39;t maintain healthy relationships or function in any normal sort of way.  Is he an indigo child because he&#39;s different, or is he different because he&#39;s been abused and neglected his entire life?  The other kid is living with me because she refuses to live with her own parents.  She&#39;s full of baggage from all the damage that she&#39;s experienced in her life.  Does that make her special?<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of those kids are unique and interesting kids.  Both of them have sustained heavy damage and don&#39;t operate at their greatest potential.  Sometimes kids that don&#39;t encounter great amounts of dysfunction, don&#39;t stand out right away because they don&#39;t need to.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve wondered for a long time if the &quot;indigo children&quot; aren&#39;t just kids that have sustained damage, or that their parents have and are projecting it onto their kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe list reframed in that light:<br/>\n<br/>\n***Have strong self esteem, connection to source<br/>\nHave an obvious sense of self<br/>\nRefuse to follow orders or directions<br/>\nGet bored rather easily with assigned tasks<br/>\nAre rather creative<br/>\nDisplay strong intuition<br/>\nHave strong empathy for others or NO empathy<br/>\nDevelop abstract thinking very young<br/>\nAre gifted and/or talented, highly intelligent<br/>\nAre often identified or suspected of having ADHD<br/>\nAre frequent daydreamers<br/>\nHave very old, deep, wise looking eyes<br/>\nHave spiritual intelligence and/or psychic skills&quot;*** <br/>\n<br/>\nHave a strong sense of how to appear in a way that makes them appear strong and connected<br/>\nAre very self absorbed<br/>\nRefuse to follow orders or directions because they live in reactionary mode<br/>\nGet bored easily because they&#39;ve never connected with anything and are always running<br/>\nAre creative because they need to be to survive<br/>\nDisplay strong ideas and assumptions about things based on their own dysfunctional frame of reference<br/>\nHave strong empathy or NO empathy depending on how it will serve to help them<br/>\nDevelop abstract thinking very young, just like lots of other kids, but never fully develop it functionally<br/>\nAre gifted and or talented, highly intelligent just like everyone else<br/>\nAre often diagnosed with things like ADHD because their parents are looking for ways to fix their kids<br/>\nAre frequent daydreamers because their lives aren&#39;t nearly as wonderful<br/>\nHave very old, deep, wise looking eyes because they&#39;ve lived and experienced things they shouldn&#39;t have<br/>\nHave spiritual intelligence and/or psychic skills developed as coping mechanisms<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Something crazy","postDate":"1313874662","msgId":62447,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhCNjMwRDNCLUFCQTMtNDM2OC1BOTQzLUIyOTNCMzhDOEJEQkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":62448,"prevInTime":62446,"nextInTime":62448,"topicId":62447,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I had forgotten about these people but now it came up on my facebook recent posts thing....

","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-888071486\">I had forgotten about these people but now it came up on my facebook &quot;recent posts&quot; thing....   Indigo children.  Gack.  <br/>\nHere&#39;s someone&#39;s description of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n=============================================<br/>\nHave strong self esteem, connection to source<br/>\nHave an obvious sense of self<br/>\nRefuse to follow orders or directions<br/>\nGet bored rather easily with assigned tasks<br/>\nAre rather creative<br/>\nDisplay strong intuition<br/>\nHave strong empathy for others or NO empathy<br/>\nDevelop abstract thinking very young<br/>\nAre gifted and/or talented, highly intelligent<br/>\nAre often identified or suspected of having ADHD<br/>\nAre frequent daydreamers<br/>\nHave very old, deep, wise looking eyes<br/>\nHave spiritual intelligence and/or psychic skills&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nMy home is a total haven for the indigo child. Maybe that&#39;s how I got so many of them to choose me for a mother. And exactly when did these children become prominent on the planet??? I have just about all of those characteristics!!!!<br/>\n=============================================<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought it would go away.  I think aliens are going to come and take them all somewhere cool at some point, too, or they&#39;re going to take over the earth or both.   But the main thing is not the kids.  The main thing is that their MOTHERS are so darned special.  They have been entrusted with some sort of superior being, due to their superior mothering abilities!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone here is tempted to believe or care about those things, here:  Unschooling works the same with all children.  Sorting children into gifted or not, ADHD or not, bored easily or not.... all of that harms the child, the parents&#39; relationship with the child, and harms the environment of natural learning.  That&#39;s all.  Be crazy if you want to be, but don&#39;t treat one of your children differently than the others that way, and don&#39;t expect me or anyone else to treat your child as a rarified alien gift to mankind.  Help him learn to live in such a way that he doesn&#39;t need to say &quot;You have to be nice to me, though; I&#39;m an Indigo child!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the responses to that posting were people who are not even my very-indirect, so-called &quot;friends&quot; (facebook not-even-acquaintances).  I don&#39;t mind having facebook friends I don&#39;t know.  I don&#39;t much like to have my tons of friends exposed to any lunacy about indigo rude/bored/no-empathy (or empathy)/daydreaming/psychic kids.  These &quot;friends&quot; of &quot;friends&quot; have gone off the deep end of the deep end.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne wrote:  &quot;I forget im &quot;indigo&quot; as well. I should stamp my statuses as well with proclamation of indigo authority hehehe&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... it&#39;s something someone can forget.   Not very gifted.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother muddied the deep-end waters with this:  &quot;the time line of when indigos, crystals, rainbows was born are not absolute to the dates that everyone says. my 19 yr old and my 10 yr old are indigos. my 7 yr old is crystal. my mom and grandmom are rainbow. lol. lol..&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLOL?  How can having an overlay of crystalline bullshit be funny?  (Okay, it&#39;s kind of amusing, but I&#39;m still going to unfriend anyone who straight-facedly writes about indigo children.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62686,"nextTopicId":62759}}
