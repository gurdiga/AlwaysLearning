as what a classroom teacher does.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>\nThrough the years, I have come to realize that many homeschooling parents have a sense that they are somehow gaming the system and doing something that isn&#39;t as special or expert as what a classroom teacher does, that they are somehow taking a shortcut.&nbsp;</div>\n<div><br></div><div>I have spent a lot of hours trying to get parents to see that while working a classroom of strangers and covering state mandated curriculum does take a certain amount of expertise, living life with the intention of being engaged with your children to help them learn and grow into who they are going to be, who they want to be, takes an entirely different set of skills that most parents can cultivate by paying attention and working it every day. &nbsp;No, it isn&#39;t easy, and it isn&#39;t the same set of skills as a classroom teacher (well some may be similar) but it is a set of skills that we start developing the minute our children are born and the fact that there isn&#39;t a degree program in homeschool parenting (or radical unschooling), or parenting does not make it any less valid as a skill set. &nbsp;</div>\n<div><br></div><div>I am reminded of a friend who always states that she decided to homeschool because she did not want to share custody of her child with the state, only getting physical custody for nights and weekends. &nbsp;It has become normal to contract out care for our children during most of their waking hours. &nbsp;Family time is not the normal circumstance, school and institutional care are the normal circumstance and time at home with family is the unusual situation now. &nbsp;The belief that children are some sort of public resource and so not to be trusted to the sole purview of the parents is probably the reason for this historical anomaly.</div>\n<div>chris</div></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-902308975gmail_extra\"><br><br><blockquote><span

I have had the ominous looking and most distasteful wad of papers on my kitchen bench fir a few months and procrastinating. This wad of papers that explains how to write the report that proves your child is receiving a &#39;high quality education&#39; and lists the samples of English and math work you are to submit. The report is due April 11. I am fairly certain the teachers who make up this unit are familiar with natural learning but not radical unschooling. It&#39;s all a bit hideous and I was wondering how radical unschoolers put such a report of proof together when there is very little tangible proof of the things that matter to these teachers (but not us) such as composition (and all the grammar and language arts therein), math facts and abilities etc. Our daughter us very smart. In a school setting she would be average or below because she hasn&#39;t been drilled on math a and spelling etc. This does not bother us in the slightest but it might bother the &quot;authorities&quot; and might not pass us on that basis. \nRight now as I type this she&#39;s happily texting her new pen pal and asking me heaps of words to spell.
