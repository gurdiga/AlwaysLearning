The average adult reportedly has approximately 10,000 taste buds, but children have more, including some dotted along the inside of their cheeks. Infants seem to arrive hard-wired to react to bitterness and sweetness, though the ability to detect saltiness takes six months or so to develop. The childish craving for sweets typically declines during adolescence, probably as a way of limiting caloric intake.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe actual number of tastbuds vary from source to source, but they are all in agreement about the fact that children have more tastebuds than adults, and therefore are more sensitive to &#39;strong&#39; tastes.<br/>\n <br/>\nMeghan<br/>\n<br/>\nChildhood is not preparation for adulthood - it is a part of life. <br/>\n~ A.
