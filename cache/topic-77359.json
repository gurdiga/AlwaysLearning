Yes, some discussions are screwed up or go off topic or are filled with mainstream advice.  So don’t get mad about it, or sad.  Try to live your life without regard to those folks.

This weekend at the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-435446051\">Someone sent me a long message and asked if she was in the twilight zone.  Short answer—don’t read things that will make you unhappy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis weekend at the HSC conference I said a couple of times that it’s good to find good examples, and to see bad examples.  It’s not good to TELL someone she was your bad example, but the way you can decide how to be is to see how you do NOT want to be, and some ways that you do want to be, and move incrementally toward what you like.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it’s a waste of energy and a pollution of your own soul to spend much time criticizing or being shocked about other people’s practices.  Let that go, unless it’s a moment of bad example, to show you how not to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst I will post the last thing my correpondent wrote. :-)  So anyone who wants to quit reading early and avoid the frustrating part can do that.<br/>\n______________<br/>\n<br/>\n it&#39;s not my intent to share negativity, I was just at such a loss as to what to do with this and where to go with it. Maybe I should post it somewhere. Maybe I should go out for a walk instead.<br/>\n___________<br/>\nHere’s the long part, and the quote is something Pam Sorooshian wrote.<br/>\n___________<br/>\n<br/>\nI’m sending you this Anonymously because I feel like I’m in the Twilight Zone here after reading some comments written by some local moms. I honestly don&#39;t know whom else I would tell this to locally who would &quot;get it&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I have always enjoyed this particular portion of a wonderful page on your website:<br/>\n<br/>\n“8. Let kids learn. Don&#39;t protect them or control them so much that they don&#39;t get needed experience. But, don&#39;t use the excuse of &quot;natural consequences&quot; to teach them a lesson. Instead, exemplify kindness and consideration. If you see a toy left lying in the driveway, don&#39;t leave it there to be run over, pick it up and set it aside because that is the kind and considerate thing to do and because kindness and consideration are values you want to pass on to your kids. Natural consequences will happen, they are inevitable. But it isn&#39;t &quot;natural&quot; anymore if you could have prevented it, but chose not to do so.” -  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/pam/howto\">http://sandradodd.com/pam/howto</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThen recently, I stumbled upon some comments written by a local mom (whom I’ll call &quot;Person A&quot;), who has some older teens, and she had posted a link to a parenting blog post about how to not be a helicopter parent, and how to parent with a “let them bleed style of parenting” (yuck, which is just so awful and ridiculous that I won’t even post a link to it) but the point is that the comments and responses in a fb group, from Person A, Person B and Person C, really broke my heart. Person C actually calls herself an Unschooler. It all made me cry to read it and also made me so angry. Am I in the Twilight Zone here??<br/>\n<br/>\nPerson A: &quot;My instinct is always to help, fix, or do for them, I have to remind myself to give my children the gift of failure. I&#39;m finding it vital in the teen years, but more difficult to watch.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPerson B: &quot;I would love to hear more about that. I&#39;m imagining the way to do it is to only offer help when asked for it?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPerson A: &quot;Depending on the age: Let them miss the bus, or not have their homework completed. Let them leave their ballet shoes at home, make their own appointments, fill out their own forms, do not remind them of the items needed for the next activity. Don&#39;t take forgotten items to school/class/game etc. after too many times forgetting (everyone forgets things once in a while). Have them finish any classes, lessons, etc. they wanted until they have completed the time period you paid for. They need to practice the instrument they wanted and you paid for. Return it if they don&#39;t. Let them get down from the table after NOT eating and do not allow them to have anything else until the next meal. NEVER make a second meal for a child who doesn&#39;t like what is being served. Don&#39;t be responsible for getting them out of bed in the morning, teach them to use an alarm clock. Yes, this means elementary kids too. Let them miss the field trip because they didn&#39;t give you the permission slip. Don&#39;t keep track of their library books or due dates. Make them work off the cost of the library book they lost of fines incurred. Don&#39;t keep reminding them about the parking ticket they got. Try not to say I told you so too often, but you can say it here and we will laugh with you. The hardest part is when they hate you because they are really frustrated with themselves and also the perception by other parents that you are not doing your job. We control and hover so much these days, that we sometimes look like BAD when we allow our children to fail. Resist that feeling and know that someday you will be sending a high functioning adult into the world.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPerson C: &quot;I&#39;m all about natural consequences&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease tell me I&#39;m in the Twilight Zone here. This cannot be how people who otherwise seemingly appear pretty normal and rational actually parent.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77357,"nextTopicId":77367}}
