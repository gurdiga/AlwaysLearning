I think it would be good to talk with the town and with our condo association.  We also have a gun range nearby, so perhaps if we went during the day when it might not be busy they could accommodate us too.  And thank you Sandra, I spoke with hubby and he felt better when I suggested it could belong to him for now.  I also spoke with my son and explained that we may have to wait till he is a little older since we want everyone in the family (including dad) to be comfortable with our decision).  I am slowly learning that making these type of decisions isn&#39;t always about saying yes or no, but about learning to respect what my son would like to do and finding a way to help him come to that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRachel</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":504505579,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Airsoft Gun for an 8 yo","postDate":"1338015030","msgId":67312,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBT09UYVhOZDZEY0hqMGtYQy1MOEwyYlkyRFppMFhrZnNqWGczLWQ4ekRzZ29kSndOQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDcyMzY3RjFBLTZDQTctNDY2OC04MTEzLTE1NTFCNkEwQTk4Q0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGpwcDRoNSs2aG9jQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8NzIzNjdGMUEtNkNBNy00NjY4LTgxMTMtMTU1MUI2QTBBOThDQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":67307,"nextInTopic":67316,"prevInTime":67311,"nextInTime":67313,"topicId":67305,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We are fairly new to unschooling and I am slowly getting my footing.  My son was schooled through 2nd grade and we relaxed homeschooled for third grade.  Now we are moving forward with unschooling. Hubby is taking longer to adapt to the changes.  He is a fairly negative person and jumps to say no first most times.  However, I know it&#39;s best for him to come to it on his own, and I am sure he will when he is ready.  So i am leading by example for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, today I am looking for some help.  My son, who is 8 years old, would like to get an airsoft gun.  We went to Wal-Mart today to check on prices and I told him that once we have enough to buy it (either me or him), we will discuss the best way for him to do so.  We currently live in a condo, so there isn&#39;t a lot of space to use it, though he says some other kids use the tennis court to shoot theirs.  I would need to talk to the condo association with him to see about using it here, but my parents also own a farm in the country, so we could use it there as well though it is an hour drive for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, hubby is insisting that an 8 year old should not have a gun.  I tried to explain that it is our job to be his partner and try to find a way to help him get what he wants, but we are still there to guide him.  This way it doesn&#39;t turn into him using his friends&#39; guns unsafely etc...  I would love some help in how we can make this happen for our son safely and suggestions on how to better explain it to my husband.  I am still so new, it&#39;s hard for me to work backward and come up with a creative solution to this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am at a point where I am ready and open to hearing honesty, so I appreciate any points you have on anything I have said here.  Thank you so very much for your time.<br/>\n<br/>\nRachel</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67208,"nextTopicId":67341}}
