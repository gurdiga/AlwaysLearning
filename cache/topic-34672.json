Why?  Because as human beings we are <br/>\ncurious and intelligent and enjoy things that challenge us to think in new ways.  And so, if <br/>\nthey are finding it fun and valuable, it&#39;s BECAUSE IT IS!  That simple--no worrying about <br/>\n&quot;educational content,&quot; etc.  The value is there because they have defined it as such.
