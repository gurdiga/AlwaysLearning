We have three children, ages 12,<br/>\n10, and 3.<br/>\n<br/>\nI first discovered John Holt through Nancy Wallace&#39;s<br/>\nbook _Better Than School_.  It was the first<br/>\nhomeschooling book I read, and I checked that book out<br/>\nabout 10 times the first two years, along with all of<br/>\nJohn Holt&#39;s books, and books by Dr. Raymond and<br/>\nDorothy Moore.  Eventually I found a copy of N.W.&#39;s<br/>\nbook on the internet and bought it.  By then I had my<br/>\nown home schooling library started.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still read Nancy Wallace&#39;s books every year, to keep<br/>\nmy resolve fresh and alive.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough not enitrely unschoolers in the radical<br/>\nsense, we do lean very far in that direction.  The<br/>\nchildren decide what they want to study, and we create<br/>\nunits of study based on that.  They help decide<br/>\nactivities, select the books, etc.  They don&#39;t mind<br/>\nwhen I suggest and add other aspects to the topics<br/>\nthat perhaps they hadn&#39;t thought about, since they<br/>\nknow that &quot;Mom will always come up with fun ideas&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past, we have done nature study a&#39;la Charlotte<br/>\nMason (sporadically, but heartily), as well as used<br/>\nher techniques of narration and very short lessons. <br/>\nWe found even that to be too structured, though, and<br/>\nseemed to take up our time spent on pursuing other<br/>\nvenues.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the children become older, I don&#39;t even do that so<br/>\nmuch any more, since their interests have changed. <br/>\nThey still enjoy learning math-related things, and<br/>\ndoing the units based on their interests, and Sarah<br/>\nreads a lot.  Andrew prefers playing games on the<br/>\ncomputer and gundams and legos.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have had trouble finding homeschooling groups where<br/>\nI actually fit in, since we are Christians who<br/>\nunschool.  It seems that almost all Christians do the<br/>\nschool-at-home route, or classical education route.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur best groups have been a local inclusive group here<br/>\nin VA, although even there unschooling is very rare,<br/>\nand there is a christ-centered unschoolers list on<br/>\nyahoo that is nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I hope I can be a part of the list here; it would<br/>\nbe wonderful to be able to connect with other HSers<br/>\nwho actually know who John Holt is, and Nancy Wallace,<br/>\nand what GWS stands for :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, sorry so long, most of my posts won&#39;t be this<br/>\nbad!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nSusan c[_]<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eclectichomeschooler@...\">eclectichomeschooler@...</a><br/>\nAOL IM:  WifeToVegman<br/>\n<br/>\nmy web page:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://theeclectichomeschooler.homestead.com/TheEclecticHomeshooler.html\">http://theeclectichomeschooler.homestead.com/TheEclecticHomeshooler.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nCheck out Yahoo!
