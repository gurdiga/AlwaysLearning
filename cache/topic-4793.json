I seem to have the <br/>\nproblem of not enough money or time to do everything I want though. One good <br/>\nplace to look for &quot;to do&quot; ideas is the local alternative papers.  If you have <br/>\npublications that are specifically for parents or some liberal types of <br/>\npapers, they usually list local activities, classes, plays and other events. <br/>\nI have found anything from pottery classes to African dance. There is so much <br/>\navailable if you just look.<br/>\nA really fun to-do-at-home type books are several by Nancy Blakely. We have <br/>\nthe &quot;Lotions, Potions and Slime. Mudpies and More.&quot;<br/>\nBut there are a couple other &quot;Mudpies&quot; books available.<br/>\nThis one has snow recipes...good if you&#39;re up North somewhere. I won&#39;t be <br/>\ndoing those anytime soon!<br/>\nAnother book we love has many recipes for doughs and paints called &quot;Magic <br/>\nMixtures&quot;. It&#39;s an indispensable reference for all types of projects.<br/>\nAnother good item to keep around is a huge roll of butcher paper....good for <br/>\noutdoor fingerpainting (with your entire body of course).<br/>\nThere is a thread at unschooling.com titled something like Unschooling <br/>\nmaterials (does anyone remember?) and there are many, many good ideas for <br/>\nactivities and items that inspire creativity.<br/>\nIt&#39;s worth printing a copy of.<br/>\nI still would love to take a &quot;Sandra class&quot; just to glean years of great <br/>\nideas.
