In California in 4th grade (I think) they do the California Missions. We do a huge business in kits for that. But some teachers have gotten wise and don&#39;t allow the kits to be used. The families from those schools are the ones walking around with the frowns and anxiety because they have to make from scratch.<br/>\n<br/>\nSciences, history, book reports of all kinds, social studies - miniatures, dioramas, reproductions, models, presentations.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen kids so frozen about the crafty projects, and the parents so worried, (and forget about it when I say &quot;when&#39;s it due?&quot;..&quot;tomorrow&quot; - yikes), that they almost need me to do it for them in the store. I have samples of projects I have made that I take to work and they take photos of them for ideas. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen there&#39;s those who have given up on any idea of excellence - &quot;he just has to have something to hand in to pass - we don&#39;t need an A&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou do know that the idea is for the kids to learn something - make connections between how the ribosomes work with the golgi apparatus; notice how Native Americans organized their division of labor in home construction; see how the Missions changed the lives of the people in CA...I don&#39;t even know what the purpose of diorama book reports is, except that once the teacher has signed off on the design, the student isn&#39;t allowed to change it - I&#39;ve seen the materials lists they bring in to the store.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd believe me, most of the parents are planning on helping their kid a lot, and most of the parents (&quot;I&#39;m not crafty&quot;, &quot;I&#39;m not artistic&quot;) are truly scared that it will be their fault if the grade is bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nStay tuned for my new publishing venture that will address this need.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Who says you have failed? Is there a test you are going to have to take to see if you have failed? Nope! Is your child happy? Are you doing a good job at making your child happy and full? It seems so! <br/>\n<br/>\nI used to compare my child, too. He has Asperger&#39;s Symdrome (gifted form of autism) and he has learning delays. He did not read until he was almost 9. He still doesn&#39;t write well because it&#39;s frustrating and causes high anxiety. We don&#39;t worry about these things. He&#39;s wonderfully happy. He learns things at his own pace. I feel that all children have a pace that is specific to their personality, etc. I read at age 4. My brother at age 4. Oh well. Does that matter now? Nope! <br/>\n<br/>\nIf it makes you feel bad to see these particular moms that are doing all of the comparing, then maybe see them less. You don&#39;t need a large quantity of friends or playmates, just a few good quality ones where hanging out makes you feel good, not less than. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe all question ourselves. This is natural, but don&#39;t beat yourself up un-necessarily. If your child is happy, then you are doing a great job. She is 5 years old after all.

Enjoying his natural talents. Reassuring myself that he is developing as he needs to and doesn&#39;t need to be force fed anything or kept on any sort of track. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been paying closer attention to what he DOES know after being informed by my MIL (was she trying to make me feel bad or take action?) that Damon doesn&#39;t know how to write lower case letters, something he should know by now as all other second grade children can do this. (According to her.) Sheesh. We had her watch him for 3 days in November and she made him sit and write letters each day. He also had to write a story which he illustrated with crude drawings (apparently he is not up to par on his drawing skills either). She claims he sat and did this willingly once she suggested it but I suspect there were bribes like a prize for completion. He would never sit and practice letters if I suggested it! I think he just wanted to please his grandma. I&#39;m trying not to dwell on this too much. She loves him and is just doing what she thinks is best. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe came yesterday to watch his last ice skating lesson and have dinner with us and again confronted me, asking how do I know if he&#39;s learning everything kids are learning in school in second grade. She saw a good book, something like &quot;Everything Your Second Grader Needs to Know&quot; and asked if I had it. She must think I really suck at homeschooling since I don&#39;t own it! I told her I&#39;d bought books like that in the past (I do have a first grade book like that!) and when we&#39;ve sat down with the book (we did, at the beginning of summer) Damon pretty much knew most of the stuff in the book and the other things he was working on in his own way. Like money was in the first grade book and he still doesn&#39;t quite get that but he has no interest yet. He has money and a wallet and a piggy bank but can&#39;t keep straight the coin values. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I was feeling the same as the original poster, being told what other kids are learning that mine is not. Is the intent to shame us? Or just information being shared? I choose to believe the latter. And maybe I&#39;ll put out the letter writing wipe off board that has lines like school paper. But if he doesn&#39;t want to write, we&#39;ll do something else. (Gotta go!

Or are they spending 5 yo time rotely practicing and parroting the skills that adults find useful? Sort of an academic version of child beauty pageants?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a huge disdain for kids in this society. The more adult-like traits kids demonstrate, the more they&#39;re celebrated. Until they hit puberty and the sexual displays start, then it&#39;s &quot;Don&#39;t be in such a rush to grow up!&quot; ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My daughter has no intrest in any of these areas <br/>\n&gt; and when she does attempt to write it&#39;s illegible. No reading yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And she may not for years. Does she need those right now? Does she need them next year?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only reason you fear is because everyone around you is absolutely convinced it takes years of practice to be competent at these skills. They&#39;re wrong. And they have no way of knowing they&#39;re wrong. They&#39;re immersed in a world where kids are not permitted to pick up these skills in a natural way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way schools get academics into kids goes against how we&#39;re naturally wired to learn. It&#39;s very hard for humans to memorize someone else&#39;s understanding of the world and then make sense of it. That&#39;s why it takes so long in school. It&#39;s why kids can &quot;pass&quot; classes and yet still have little practical understanding of what&#39;s been pushed in their heads.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re hard wired to pull understanding out of life. We&#39;re pattern seeking creatures. Natural learning often doesn&#39;t look like much of anything from the outside. But it&#39;s like working on a million piece jigsaw puzzle. Kids are working here and there, jumping all over the place, spending a chunk of time in one area, then seemingly abandoning it for another. It doesn&#39;t look like progress. But by the time they&#39;re teens, the connections they&#39;ve been creating between all the areas they&#39;ve been working on shows. And it&#39;s not a bunch of memorized facts (that will fade) but a deeper understanding of how things work.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhereas the kids in school have been told what pieces to put where and how to put them in, to drop that interesting piece because it&#39;s not part of the curriculum. By the time they hit middle school most are ready to slam the door on the puzzle and have nothing more to do with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; do I need to strew stuff on writing some how<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The question points to a misunderstanding of strewing. (And misunderstanding is part of the process of pulling understanding from chaos! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nStrewing isn&#39;t dropping bread crumbs in a line to lead a child to a particular destination. Strewing is placing potentially interesting things around the house. A leaf. A rock. A comic. A puzzle. A 12-sided die. They don&#39;t lead any particular direction. They may be picked up and played with for a minute or an hour. They may be ignored.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou should make sure she has opportunities and the tools to write when *she* finds it useful. Which might be tomorrow. Which might be 5 years from now. And writing might not look like (school) writing. Offering to write down or audio-record her stories for her is writing. Having a conversation, even, is connected to and in support of writing. Talking with each other about what you liked and didn&#39;t like about a movie connects to writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids in school aren&#39;t getting that. What they&#39;re getting is an experience with writing being hard and boring and what they need to do to get positive attention from adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat supports natural learning is *access* to the million piece jigsaw puzzle. That access looks like pieces strewn about the house which are then swept up every few days and replaced with new ones. It&#39;s helping kids get more of what intrigues them. It&#39;s being interested in the kids and fascinated about life. It&#39;s taking them new places. It&#39;&#39;s bringing in new experiences (food, movies, YouTube videos). How much of each will depend on the kids. But creating the environment that runs parts of life the kids don&#39;t realize exist into the kids lives is the parents role.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Learning to roll with it","postDate":"1323944664","msgId":64430,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFGMTg0NTAwLTVGRDktNDIxNC1CNTk4LUVCRDk5NkFBRTc1QkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpjYzZpaitlbDcyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpjYzZpaitlbDcyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64427,"nextInTopic":64432,"prevInTime":64429,"nextInTime":64431,"topicId":64427,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I know through coming here I will get a mixed response but thats what life is like.-=- Do you consider mixed responses to be a bad thing, then?
