She was going to go to the world choir games in Cincinnati in July, but the plan has fallen through, so that opens her summer up and she wants to take classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe said there are six classes that lead to a certificate, and she might go and speak with an advisor tomorrow to see if she qualifies for the math class and what order they should be taken in.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s also interested in taking a liquor server&#39;s licensing course, but that&#39;s not at the college.  I told her I would look for one.  With that, she could work in a restaurant that serves liquor, or in a bar.  She turns 21 in November, but I think in a restaurant situation she could serve before then.  (Or not...)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as I know, the management she&#39;s interested in (that she&#39;s been asking about and paying attention to) is management of bands and of small music venues. She volunteers at Amped, downtown, and is learning to do sound and lights.   The last time she worked a show, she was helping with stage setup and learning to mic drumsets.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66942,"nextTopicId":66982}}
