Work backwards from the time you want them to go to bed.  Find winding-down routines that have to do with sleepiness and quiet time rather than the clock.  Not having an *arbitrary* bedtime is good.  Having times that it makes sense to go to bed for real, sensible reasons is not bad, and it&#39;s fairly necessary with younger children and small houses and a parent who needs to get up early and go to work to Pay for that small house and this unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSleep is more important than anyone&#39;s imagined &quot;right&quot; to stay up.  Please don&#39;t confuse choices and options with &quot;rights.&quot;  <br/>\nEach person in the house, whether an infant or a grandparent or an eighteen year old should have a quiet place to sleep if possible, and a dark place, and an undisturbed stretch of time.  That should take precedence over gaming and playing and movies, and any noise that comes along with or from those.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":383546898,"authorName":"Sadie Bugni","from":"Sadie Bugni &lt;lotsagr8kidz@...&gt;","profile":"mesarylee","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: OP here from kids staying up all night","postDate":"1341513699","msgId":68094,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBTXVoc3N6RTE0amUrRlI2K3hVUEFEWmhwZlNzTG1jd2RpcmptNVUyTF9pV1dfbXNvUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":68093,"nextInTopic":68095,"prevInTime":68093,"nextInTime":68095,"topicId":68090,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We usually use the term quiet time.

So instead of listening to their bodies, they are<br/>\ntrying to stay up as late as possible, for as many nights as possible,<br/>\nuntil they lose the ability to do so.  Since you describe this as a<br/>\n&quot;&#39;Summer vacation&#39; indulgence&quot; it seems that your own mind set is also one<br/>\nwhere it may be taken away or end at some point.  Perhaps a quick talk with<br/>\nthem about the fact that they will always have this option and that they<br/>\ndon&#39;t have to worry about it going away would help.  Maybe also explaining<br/>\nto them the reason behind it if they are in a mood to listen.  If you don&#39;t<br/>\nhave a good reason right now, be sure to read some older posts on here,<br/>\nthere are lots of great discussions about this topic.

It started slowly.  I stopped saying things like &quot;it&#39;s bedtime&quot; months ago.

Mine just don&#39;t want to go.  Son is usually in the middle of a video game, and daughter is either watching a show or gaming on the computer.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a little bedtime background, we&#39;ve always had a family bed.  My daughter started sleeping on her own 2 years ago, and is fiercely independent in her sleeping now (doesn&#39;t even want to share a bed w/ anyone on vacation).   She goes in her room and shuts the door.  My son still sleeps w/ hubby or I (I&#39;ve taken to sleeping in my son&#39;s room because the 3 of us could no longer comfortably fit in our King bed).  So son bounces back and forth between his dad and I (hubby and I are both totally comfortable w/ this arrangement).  When someone sleeps over, son sleeps alone in his room (because he&#39;d be embarrassed), but that&#39;s the only time he wants to.  Otherwise he&#39;s scared, or simply enjoys the closeness to us.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, daughter can go in her room at a reasonable time, but she&#39;ll still stay up all night.  Son will come into bed w/ one of us, and eventually fall asleep.  This may sound like a stupid question, but would you simple say &quot;lights out&quot; (except for maybe a reading light), and that&#39;s it?  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey used to say to me &quot;but WHY do we have to go to bed now?  Do we have something planned tomorrow?&quot; (which we usually didn&#39;t).  I truthfully couldn&#39;t come up w/ a good answer, besides &quot;dad&#39;s more comfortable w/ you guys having a bedtime, because that&#39;s how he was raised&quot;.  I guess it&#39;s gotten out of hand now though.  When I say to them &quot;you&#39;re too loud&quot;, the response is always &quot;we&#39;ll be quieter!&quot;, which they&#39;re actually doing better w/ the past few days, because I&#39;ve given better reminders right before I go up to bed.  Just asking the question on this list has helped me think a little more clearly about it all.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67778,"nextTopicId":68073}}
