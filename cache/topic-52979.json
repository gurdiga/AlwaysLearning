I keep thinking how much better it would have been for their parents to spend that college money in pursuit of what their kids really wanted.  The trouble is, the kids didn&#39;t really have a chance to figure that out.  Maybe it&#39;s still looking utopian from the parents point of view, but not so much from where the kids are. <br/>\n<br/>\nI liked how the daughter in the GMA interview looked right at the camera when she closed the door to her (I presume) bedroom and said, &quot;You guys can&#39;t go in there.&quot;  &lt;g&gt;  I have friends in their forties and fifties who would be apologizing and blushing and making excuses over an untidy room (in their own house!) and this young woman just said no.&lt;g&gt;     Too bad they used it to insinuate these kids might not be learning how to look after themselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is my segue into my little morning news bit.&lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we heard the shuttle would be descending over Montana we thought we&#39;d like to go see if we could spot it.   I was going to just stay up all night but around one in the morning I flaked out and went to bed.  We planned to leave the house a little after five to drive up the hill and find a good spot to watch.  I set my clock to get up early enough to take care of the critters before we left because we thought we might go out to breakfast after.  Dylan stayed up.   When I got up he had already let the dog out and in again, had fed him, had changed his water, watered the bird and fed the cats and cleaned out the litter pans.     <br/>\n<br/>\nA kid who never had chores, who could watch TV and eat what he wanted, the kind of kid some of the thoughtful readers at the Good Morning America website predicted would turn out  &quot;a loser,&quot; who was awake in a house with three TV&#39;s, cable, Netflix movies, two computers, a game system, a telephone, beer and CUPCAKES forgodssake, was up at four thirty in the morning reading &quot;The Filmmaker&#39;s Handbook,&quot;  eating organic salad.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a loser! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did drive up the hill, set up the telescope, swill hot chocolate, gaze at stars, hang out, talk, finally give up and go to breakfast.  Shuttle landing delayed. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Good Morning America","postDate":"1271708737","msgId":53020,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI2NEFDNDdELUJBRjQtNDY0NS05RkFFLUI3QTEwN0YyNjBGNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGgyaDNhOTNmZmYxMTAwNDE5MTIwOW9hMTI4MGVrODRmN2U5NzFlMDVlYmVhMkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGhxaGwxZitzaTM5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NjVCRUE0QzItRkJBQS00Mzk2LUI2MjEtMTJDNDJDQjE3RTI1QHZlcml6b24ubmV0PiA8Njk5MDA0LjUyMDc1LnFtQHdlYjg2MjA2Lm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPGgyaDNhOTNmZmYxMTAwNDE5MTIwOW9hMTI4MGVrODRmN2U5NzFlMDVlYmVhMkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":53019,"nextInTopic":53021,"prevInTime":53019,"nextInTime":53021,"topicId":52979,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- I thought the way she questioned the teens and the things she asked them about were obviously intended to make them look goofy ... which they didn t.

Brainstorm questions that you think the journalist might ask.  Come up with awesome answers and practice saying them so they flow easily.  Remember who your audience is. Craft your responses accordingly.  You don&#39;t have to answer stupid questions, turn the question into something that plays to your strengths.

I want my children and my husband and I to be able to explain what we do to the clueless in an articulate way. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we&#39;re doing is radical and most people think it&#39;s ridiculous.

Isn&#39;t the whole idea of PE, to help kids be physically fit?  Jeez, they showed the kids doing boffer fights together.  Most of Chamille&#39;s friends go to school.  The boys are skate boarders who love to parkour, neither of which are in any way done in PE classes.  They are very physically adept and physically fit kids, but it has nothing to do with PE classes which they all admittedly dislike.  One of them dislikes it primarily because he&#39;s forced to dress and undress in public, and routinely gets marked down for refusing to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nChamille&#39;s experience with sports has been taking tennis classes and martial arts, riding bikes, skate boarding, swimming, and when she was a lot younger, gymnastics and dance.
