I have a public school teen- her choice, most definitely NOT mine. She has access to friends, to the internet, to boys, phones, etc.  She doesn&#39;t ask to use the PC or get told to get off after so long- unless someone else needs to use it, and I don&#39;t worry about what she does if stays up after me at night.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I&#39;m unsure why a parent would deny the child the use of the internet at school?  I wonder if this parent also denied use of the internet in her home or if she only allows it during certain hours, has parental blocks, etc? I couldn&#39;t imagine.  I trust my kids and wouldn&#39;t dream of such a thing- not just with the internet but with everyday life.   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Tina<br/>\n  (Hawaii, Jaclyn-15, Megan-13, Ryan-8)<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  School Blamed for Daughter&#39;s Internet Liaison<br/>\n<br/>\n(Honeoye, N.Y.)
