Now I&#39;m SAHM with SAHK&#39;s (stay at home kids :-)and I have to<br/>\n&gt; figure out how to live (spend my time).  I got some good ideas from a<br/>\n&gt; book called Wishcraft.  The author has exercises that helped me figure<br/>\n&gt; out some of the things I want to be doing and I have/am doing some of<br/>\n&gt; them.  Isn&#39;t it enriching for a child to be around adults who are really<br/>\n&gt; living?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I LOVE&lt; LOVE LOVE Wishcraft (by Barbara Sher). It&#39;s one of those books I&#39;ve <br/>\npurchased many of to give to people. PERECT for unschoolers... she assumes <br/>\nyou can do anything (without becoming a better person first).   Really...buy <br/>\nthis book immediately :)<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4856,"nextTopicId":4864}}
