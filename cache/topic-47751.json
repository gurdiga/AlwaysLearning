Most of the school has just experienced a vampire attack and the next day they are talking about rival gangs and how it was way cool and not about risk or possible death. Giles, the adult helper, says &quot;People have a tendency to rationalize what they can and forget what they can&#39;t.&quot; Maybe it is so far out to believe that a teenager would enjoy being with their parent that they rationalize it as an anomaly, or they write it off as a lie on the parent&#39;s part. Maybe, too, it becomes another statement of failure as a parent. If you know that someone else has a good relationship with their teenager it argues that the screaming and fighting and sneaking and lying that may exist in your own family comes as much from you as it does from some hormonally driven need to separate from their home-life. And that&#39;s gotta be a bitter pill to swallow. Instead of looking with wonder at the possibility that you could<br/>\n have a good relationship with your child. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Joanna &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ridingmom@...\">ridingmom@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Wednesday, 7 October, 2009 8:16:34<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Teenaged girls and twitter (and unschoolers and food)<br/>\n<br/>\nYes--I&#39;ve also been told that my son is an anomaly.

Caring parents search children&#39;s bedrooms to find/confiscate items that aren&#39;t good for them and can harm their growing up. As kids become more and more independent, they hide things from their parents so they feel empowered to become an adult.  I&#39;ve never understood her way of thinking.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen again, this is the same person that held my newborn son 13 years ago, then laughed and told me that now I would learn what being a real parent meant, because boys never get close to their moms.

There were so many components of what she said that seemed sad to me that I didn&#39;t quite know where to start.  She was actually asking my opinion on the &quot;spying&quot; thing, which lead to me describing our relationship where &quot;spying&quot; isn&#39;t even in the equation--my desire to do it, or his desire to &quot;hide&quot; stuff.
