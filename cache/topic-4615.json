I think I showed a math workbook, and only a few pages <br/>\nhad been messed with.  He didn&#39;t look through it.  Just recorded the <br/>\nnames of things we were using.<br/>\nA friend of mine started making a list of things covered by her kids <br/>\nand divided them into subjects.  The books read and field trips taken <br/>\ntook up pages to themselves.  I did that (but he never came that <br/>\nyear).  I wrote the heading &quot;math&quot; and under it would write all the <br/>\ncomputer games, real life games, workbooks we happen to have here, <br/>\nPuzzle Mania, savings account, shopping.....then I did the same for <br/>\nscience......  Filled up a few pages, and it was easy and kinda fun. <br/>\n(Though I haven&#39;t done it again in over 2 years so it must not have <br/>\nbeen *that* fun) My friend said the ps man just took her list and put <br/>\nit in the file and chatted a little then left.  That was it.<br/>\nI&#39;m sure it depends on your county and whose in charge of <br/>\nhomeschoolers.
