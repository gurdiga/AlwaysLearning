Kids love to talk during imaginative play and if you give them a little cue they will do most of the imaginative talking if you just encourage it a bit. I also tell my son, after he has proclaimed my ideas as awful or bad, that I am not very good at making up stories so he needs to help me.

It wasn&#39;t even her birthday. :-)  But we got all her ponies out into the largest room we have, and invited other girls over.  They could bring ponies, or didn&#39;t need to.  They had a really great time, and after that Holly&#39;s ponies were infused (for her) with those memories and associations.  They had ALL been on a grand adventure.   With Polly Pockets, one girl at a time might be better, or two.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEven if you have to pay someone to come and play with her, it might be worth doing.  We had a neighbor seven years older than my oldest, 12 years older than my youngest, and I used to give her $3 an hour to come over while I was home, as a mother&#39;s helper.  Sometimes she held the baby and that was her favorite thing at first.  When Holly wanted to nurse, Ay played with the boys.  As the kids got older, she would babysit sometimes and I would pay her $5 an hour (some neighborhoods the going rate is higher for a teenaged babysitter, but she lived three houses up and wanted to get away from her younger sisters when she could).  She was homeschooled, so she could come over all kinds of times.  She would play with whichever kids wanted play, and maybe get them drinks and snacks.  It was beneficial to everyone involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might consider how thrilled an older girl would be to be *paid* to play dolls!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] I need help playing with dolls","postDate":"1295457197","msgId":58986,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE1ODIzMDZGLTgyNUEtNEFGOC1BQTNELTY4ODBDNUY2Q0UyOUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDVEODZGNkYwLUJBRDgtNDA1NC1BMzc5LUEzRDY5RUU5QUQwMkBnbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGloNjVsOSszMmtsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NUQ4NkY2RjAtQkFEOC00MDU0LUEzNzktQTNENjlFRTlBRDAyQGdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":58985,"nextInTopic":58987,"prevInTime":58985,"nextInTime":58987,"topicId":58983,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I never got into playing Barbies with Holly.

In the course of that game, Zoya ran through many of the things that had happened in the past few days.

At first, I was  <br/>\nbored to tears with the idea of playing Polly Pockets but,  I found  <br/>\nthat I enjoyed myself and she felt filled up faster when I put 100%  <br/>\ninto playing Polly Pockets with her the way SHE wanted me to play.  I  <br/>\ndropped any agendas I may have had running through my head and  <br/>\nimmersed myself in her imaginary world as best as I could.  If I  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t saying the right words for my Polly Pocket, I asked my daughter  <br/>\nto tell me what to say long enough that I understood the theme of her  <br/>\nimagination that day.  She liked to repeat themes - often we played  <br/>\nthat our dolls were sisters who&#39;s mom had left us home alone together.  <br/>\nWe talked about fashion and boys and going to parties.  I had to  <br/>\nintentionally push out thoughts like - What am I going to fix for  <br/>\ndinner? It was almost like a type of meditation to be able to focus so  <br/>\ncompletely on my daughter&#39;s play and desire to have me with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs with so many other needs, I found that when I was able to meet this  <br/>\nneed of hers and fill her up with my focused attention doing what she  <br/>\nwanted, she would soon enough be ready to play on her own and I was  <br/>\nexcused to go do whatever I wanted.  Sometimes, I wanted to stay and  <br/>\nplay - I was enjoying listening to the inner-workings of her  <br/>\nimagination and we were having fun together!<br/>\n<br/>\nPolly Pocket playing happened when Zoe was 4,5,6 & 7 ish if I remember  <br/>\ncorrectly, maybe up to age 9. She&#39;s 13 now and she still has a big box  <br/>\nof dolls and accessories under her bed that she never plays with but I  <br/>\nhaven&#39;t wanted to store them in the basement or give them away or sell  <br/>\nthem because that box of dolls reminds me of so many happy times with  <br/>\nher.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust last night, she was excited to receive and play a new video game  <br/>\n-- she LOVES Little Big Planet 2! It&#39;s a single or multi-player game  <br/>\ndepending on how you want to play it.  You can play online with others  <br/>\nif you want.  She was wanting to play solo last night so that she  <br/>\ncould explore it&#39;s features thoroughly without interruption.  She kept  <br/>\nturning down her online friends&#39; invites to join them or requests to  <br/>\nlet them join her!  However, she didn&#39;t want to be alone as she  <br/>\nexperienced this long-awaited excitement!  So, I sat in the living  <br/>\nroom while she played.  I read my email or played my own games (Plants  <br/>\nvs. Zombies thanks to Sandra!) on my iPad while she played  and I was  <br/>\nable to pause what I was doing whenever she wanted me to pay more  <br/>\nattention to some new, fantastic feature of the game that she was  <br/>\nplaying.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is that the more present you can be for your daughter now the  <br/>\nbetter connected you will feel to her in the future.  Sharing her  <br/>\nlife, thoughts, interests and fun with you is probably the most  <br/>\nimportant way for her to connect with you and the time you invest in  <br/>\nmeeting her need for your participation in her play and activities now  <br/>\nwill payoff down the road when she&#39;s older and more capable of  <br/>\nentertaining herself without your help. And, you might just find that  <br/>\nplaying Polly Pockets is kind of fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nChris in IA<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":183568025,"authorName":"Bob Collier","from":"&quot;Bob Collier&quot; &lt;bobcollier@...&gt;","profile":"quaussiebob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: I need help playing with dolls","postDate":"1295443054","msgId":58984,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGloNm85ZSsyNGdvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGloNjVsOSszMmtsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58983,"nextInTopic":58985,"prevInTime":58983,"nextInTime":58985,"topicId":58983,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

For those who aren&#39;t familiar with them, they are little plastic dolls about 3&quot; tall that come with rubber clothes, shoes, and a multitude of accessories.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my daughter first discovered them at a friends house about 2 years ago, I hated them.  I was very much against plastic toys at that time and wanted my daughter to play with natural, wooden toys.  Every time we went to that friends house though, I could see how much she loved to play with them.  I also began reading more about unschooling and letting go of some of my more conventional parenting methods.  For her 4th birthday, I put Polly Pockets on her wishlist and she received some as a gift from a relative (I was still not a point where I would buy them myself).  We also started giving her an allowance, and she chose to purchase Polly Pockets quite frequently.  She gets $2/week, and several times saved up to buy a $10 Polly Pocket set.  I also helped her find and buy a lot of used Polly Pockets on craigslist so she could get more for her money.  It wasn&#39;t until this Christmas that I chose to buy her some Polly Pocket dolls with my own money.  I finally reached a point where I could see how much she really enjoyed them, and I knew it would make her happy to have them, and I wanted to give her that little bit of joy.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe plays with them almost every single day, and very often asks me to play with her.  I guess maybe I just forgot how to play with dolls, but I find myself sighing and groaning inwardly when she asks me to play with her.  I just don&#39;t know what to DO when we play with the dolls.  I&#39;ll sit down and try to play, but I can&#39;t seem to do it in a way that makes either of us happy.  When I make my dolls say something, she sometimes doesn&#39;t seem happy with what I say or do.  Lots of times it seems she just wants me to create a whole story and tell it myself with the dolls, and sometimes I do, but so often she wants to do the same thing again and again and again and I lose interest.  I tend to want to sit down and do things like organize all the little clothes and shoes into piles, or set up a scene with all the furniture and dolls, but I find it really hard to just play with her.  Sometimes I&#39;ll just suggest we do something other than Polly Pockets because I don&#39;t like to play with them, but I think she picks up on that and I don&#39;t want to send a message that I don&#39;t see any value in something she loves so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure many of you had or have daughters who love to play with dolls, whether it&#39;s Polly Pockets or Barbies or something else.  Can you give me some advice or link me to some threads that have discussed playing with dolls?
