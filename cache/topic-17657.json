Andy who&#39;s 7, has confided two crushes in the last year.  One a little girl (older than him by 1 yr) whose family moved to Alaska last summer, the other is a cousin (my dh Gary&#39;s 1st cousin&#39;s child) who is Andy&#39;s age.  He has a huge crush on the cousin, Sierra, telling us he&#39;s going to marry her someday -- they&#39;ll have 3 little girls for me to take care of and she will nurse all the babies of course! He&#39;s been making plans for their &#39;date&#39; when we get to California for a visit.  Just a few days ago, he made a passing remark about how much he likes an older girl in our homeschool playgroup -- she&#39;s older, very cute and sweet to him (to all the kids really) but he says he could never tell her because she might kiss him or something! <br/>\n <br/>\nHis new habit is making sure to smooth his hair when we go somewhere, because &#39;we might see a beautiful girl&#39; and he wants to look his best! <br/>\n <br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
