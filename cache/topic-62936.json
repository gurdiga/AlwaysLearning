I have a daughter that is full of ideas, all of the time...and they are involved, intricate, &quot;real-world&quot; interests vs. the watered-down versions that sometimes cater to kids. If I am being honest, I admit to being overwhelmed fairly regularly. As an option to communicating this feeling to my daughter, I really like the idea of &quot;exploring what is possible&quot; together, regardless of the project that is wished for...I imagine that sometimes she would follow through with tenacity...and sometimes she may turn to something else when she sees the level of involvement required (if, in fact, she is not interested in this level of involvement)...but that either way, support is offered for these  ideas vs. a kid simply seeing her mom in an overwhelmed state...or   a mom who is attempting to limit her!<br/>\n<br/>\nKirsten<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Sep 17, 2011, at 7:37 AM, m_aduhene wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; my son, 7, woke up this morning and announced he wants to build a  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; shop. with real bricks.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t have any ideas but I do really remember that desire at about  <br/>\n&gt; the same age!

A store? A workshop? What kind of bricks? The little red kind or concrete blocks? Ask him for details, if that&#39;s not too frustrating for him. Sometimes people (kids And adults) get half-ideas, inspiration without any real sense of the details.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t bog down too much wondering &quot;how are we going to do this?&quot; and don&#39;t let yourself get stressed over the chance that he&#39;s going to be disappointed. If he reeeaaaalllllly wants to do this and do it a certain way... probably he&#39;s going to end up disappointed. Constructing a real brick building isn&#39;t the sort of thing which happens on a 7yo&#39;s timetable. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut maybe he just wants to play with the idea for awhile, as far as he can, so keep talking with him and tossing out ideas. Does it have to be a Brick shop? Wood is faster. A pre-fab metal building is faster still. It might help to look at different kinds of buildings and even different kinds of wall facings. You can have a faux brick exterior over wood or metal or... straw bales if you wanted ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n If what he wants is to sell things - that kind of shop - you could  go to a farmers market or craft show and see what people use for booths. A little awning and a table set up on the sidewalk is a lovely &quot;shop&quot; which can be taken down at the end of the day. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;explained simply what we would need to do and said we could start with a wall. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>****************<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, er, construction experience, here - for an actual building you start with the foundation, which can be the most tedious part of the whole process, but it could be fun, too. Do you need a patio? Having a concrete slab poured can be fascinating for kids, and then you can build something on top of it later if you want. But in the time it takes to build the forms, get it poured and wait for the concrete to cure your guy could lose interest, too, or get really disappointed with the amount of time it&#39;s taking. He doesn&#39;t want a concrete slab, after all, he wants a shop! and he&#39;s going to be running up against some real life limits in that sense. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] looking for ideas","postDate":"1316264011","msgId":62941,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBEODg4RkQzLTZGNzYtNEZCNy1CRDhELTQxM0I1MzY2QzUwREB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGo1MjBvdSthaW03QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGo1MjBvdSthaW03QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":62936,"nextInTopic":62945,"prevInTime":62940,"nextInTime":62942,"topicId":62936,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
