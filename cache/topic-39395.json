I joined RUN as it<br/>\nsounded like fun and I joined facebook the other day so that I could<br/>\nplay scrabble with my sister.  I&#39;m not really sure of the etiquitte of<br/>\nadding friends, though.  So far I&#39;ve just been initiating contact with<br/>\npeople I know and like in real life or people I have had private<br/>\nconversations with online and that has been fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe place I am having trouble is with people that I feel like I know<br/>\nthrough bigger groups, but really don&#39;t know personally.  I have felt<br/>\ninclined to add various people who write a lot here, especially if I<br/>\nknow them in some other way (say through a RUN group) but then I feel<br/>\nlike I&#39;m being too forward and I should leave them alone and give them<br/>\nspace to be friendly with their actual friends. If they wanted to add<br/>\nme, they would.   On the other hand, I also post a lot on a regional<br/>\nlist that I started and I feel as though I shouldn&#39;t add people who<br/>\nare in the group, lest they feel like they have to be friendly since<br/>\nit&#39;s my group... I don&#39;t know if that makes any sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, I don&#39;t feel as though I have a good feel for the<br/>\netiquitte of social networks and I would appreciate some advice :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this doesn&#39;t seem too off topic... it seemed relevant to me but<br/>\nI can imagine other interpretations.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nMargaret</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39326,"nextTopicId":39427}}
