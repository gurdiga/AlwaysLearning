See the richness that exists beyond the door.<br/>\n<br/>\n(An additional part of the problem is the body isn&#39;t doing vastly different things even though the brain is. But the body doesn&#39;t do vastly different things when reading, either. Reading Stephen Hawking&#39;s A Brief History of Time isn&#39;t the same experience as reading Fifty Shades of Grey.

Though it&#39;s possible it&#39;s working for you but not for everyone (as Meredith pointed out about her hiking days as a child.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat will help in a broader way is:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) don&#39;t see the family as having needs. A family is a collection of individuals with individual needs. One of the hats you&#39;ll wear as an unschooling mom is being attuned to what each needs. (Including your husband. Including you too!) Sometimes meeting individual needs can be done by rallying the troops to all do something fun together. But don&#39;t depend on that. It&#39;s cool when it happens :-) But it&#39;s also easy and convenient which means it can be tempting to ignore that one may not be as happy.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) don&#39;t confuse your needs with the needs of the individuals in your family. As an adult you have the power to meet your own needs. You have the power to manipulate the physical world, to infuse a different mood into the atmosphere (though not to control what it does to others!) If one solution doesn&#39;t work, try another. Don&#39;t turn your first choice into the new problem. If you need to connect, don&#39;t let it all ride on one way. Which turns getting everyone to comply with your solution into the new problem. If one way doesn&#39;t work, build up a storehouse of other solutions you can try. Don&#39;t let your happiness ride on other people doing what you want them to do. Don&#39;t make your family responsible for meeting your needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":284087656,"authorName":"Karen","from":"&quot;Karen&quot; &lt;semajrak@...&gt;","profile":"semajrak","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Video games.

That seems harsh to me.  My husband works on projects for years, with some very intense periods where he really dives in deep.  Sometimes I talk him into doing something with Ethan and I when he would really prefer to continue on his project.  As we&#39;re out and about, his mind is clearly on his work.  I don&#39;t push it.  I thank him for the time he has spent with us, and we head home.  He returns to his project.  He doesn&#39;t make the whole day tense by preferring to be doing something other than what I would like him to be doing.  Maybe for a moment I&#39;m a bit bummed.  But that&#39;s just a moment.  Not a whole tense, ruined day.  I&#39;m reminded of Sandra&#39;s Moments page, as I type (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/moment)\">http://sandradodd.com/moment)</a>. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;For the last couple of weeks no matter what we are doing he is asking to go home and play video games.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Some people really like to dive into the things they are interested in.  Both my husband and my son are like that.  Two weeks to explore a new passion is really not a lot of time.  Give him more of what he is interested in.  There are some fun Minecraft fridge magnets (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/e7fa/)\">http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/e7fa/)</a>.  We got our son and his friend Minecraft tshirts.  There are some fun Minecraft papercrafts you can print yourself and assemble (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://minecraftpapercraft.com/)\">http://minecraftpapercraft.com/)</a>.  The Minecraft Wiki is a goldmine of information the two of you could perhaps explore together, not to mention Minecraft Youtube videos.  Get yourself an account and play with your son.  It&#39;s a fantastic game!  The three of you could go on our family server together if you would like.  If so, email me separately and I will pass on our IP address.

This is a great quote by Deb Lewis:  &quot;Power struggles can disappear when the person with the power stops struggling.&quot;  Be his partner.  Support his interests.  That generosity on your part will not go unnoticed.

Get your family a couple of hand held gaming systems. You can get older ones used, probably on Craigs list or, more certainly, on ebay, or even at a local gaming store and it will probably come with a warranty. That way when you do go out, your youngest will have a gaming connection to keep him engaged while the rest of you get your fill of a day out. You could get an ipad, maybe. See it as an educational expense, if it&#39;s within your budget to do so. <br/>\n<br/>\nSimon usually has his ipod with him when we go out. He removes it when he&#39;s in conversation with people, but in the moments when we are moving through something that isn&#39;t interesting to him he can be listening to whatever book it is he&#39;s listening to at that time. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want someone else to go along with your plans it helps to make your plans appealing for them. Make it easy for the other person to come along. Offer something special just for them. When Simon was little and we wanted to go and do something out, he&#39;s never been much for leaving home, we would let him pick a pokemon figure from this fabulous store in Kyoto to make it special for him. We would stop and get ice cream. We would try and make sure that there was something that he really wanted within the day. Sometimes it wouldn&#39;t work. Sometimes the lures to go out weren&#39;t greater than the joy of staying home. So, sometimes we didn&#39;t go. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe sometimes you don&#39;t go thing, is a hard thing to take. You are the adult. You want to go and do this thing. Why can&#39;t you go and do this thing?!! Maybe when you feel like your parade is being rained upon, you could think about the wonder that it is to be able to give into someone else&#39;s desires. It sounds like a kind of martyrdom, but it isn&#39;t. One of my favourite meals that I don&#39;t like is pizza. Everyone in my family likes pizza, except me. I make a sourdough crust that takes 4 to 6 days to come to fruition and spend the evening rolling out crusts and prebaking them to be topped up with whatever toppings each person wants and then I get to have my own meal choice. I don&#39;t have to eat the pizza! Which is why I love pizza night. I don&#39;t have to clean my plate. I don&#39;t have to eat what&#39;s on the menu. I don&#39;t have to partake of that which I don&#39;t want to.

That could be a way for him to play all the games he wants while the rest of the family gets to be out and about. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut it also may be that your son doesn&#39;t want to be out and about as much as you do - that&#39;s he&#39;s really happier to be in his own space doing his thing. It may be a transitional thing - he&#39;s nesting while he&#39;s healing. Or it may be the first time he&#39;s felt like he could actually tell you what was really important to him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Over the weekend we had some really nice weather and went on a family hike, which is something we have always loved to do<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We&quot; statements about families like that are problematic. My parents would have said the same thing... except *I* didn&#39;t love to hike. I put up with it because it was what &quot;we&quot; the family did, and most of the time I made the best of it. And over time I built up layers and layers of frustration and resentment. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;but our youngest kept asking to go home and it made the day very tense<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Poor guy - stuck doing something he didn&#39;t want to do all day, and no-one caring about his feelings, only that they &quot;made the day very tense&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nI still don&#39;t like hiking. It&#39;s hard to do fun things while hiking. It&#39;s hard to read, or play games, or work on a project and so you&#39;re stuck plodding along, bored and frustrated while the hours slip away, wasted with pointless walking. I&#39;d rather sit someplace lovely with a book or game or project than hike. Maybe your son feels the same way! Can you arrange for him to be home with a sitter while y&#39;all go hiking? Or visit a friend and play some 2-player games while you&#39;re out.<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than trying to figure out how to squash him back into the box, rethink the way you approach things as a family. If hiking has been the way to bond, look for ways which work for your son - maybe he hasn&#39;t been bonding! Maybe he&#39;s just been complying and putting a good face on things - kids are good at that. <br/>\n<br/>\nRather than try to get him to like what you do, see what he enjoys, join him where he is and see his pleasures and triumphs and challenges. Value him for who he is right now instead of who you hope he&#39;ll be. Right now, he&#39;s someone who loves to play games - what games? Read about them, find out about the characters, related games, movies, shows, comics, fan fiction. Expand your mind and open your heart so that you can create a more peaceful home that includes your child&#39;s values as well as your own. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Video games.

We do split up sometimes, but when my husband is at work that is not an option. <br/>\nThe hour or so since I typed my initial post, I have had time to think, and I also think that maybe he feels too often like he is along for the ride. I&#39;m going to work on that as well. My eldest has an archery class at 1:00 that he would be crushed if he missed, so I promised my youngest that I would take him to a new Lego store called Bricks and Minifigs while his brother is in Archery. He got really excited. I&#39;m am trying to find ways to make sure everyone&#39;s needs are met without exerting control. Thanks for all the advice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert and Colleen&quot; &lt;3potatoes@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ****because staying home indefinitely is not going to work for my eldest son<br/>\n&gt; or my husband.****<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then can your eldest son and husband go out and go hiking or enjoy whatever<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re into at the moment, while you stay home with your younger son so he<br/>\n&gt; can pursue what he&#39;s interested in?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My 9 year old goes through periods where he loves to be out-and-about, and<br/>\n&gt; he wants to go to playgrounds, explore wildlife centers, hike, tour through<br/>\n&gt; cemeteries, go birding and search for Bald Eagles and Snowy Owls, go to the<br/>\n&gt; beach, play with friends, etc.  He has other times where Home is where he<br/>\n&gt; wants to be - and he wants to play video games, build legos, watch Star Trek<br/>\n&gt; Next Generation, hang out and play board games, etc.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sometimes when he wants to stay home, it&#39;s a day my husband and I would like<br/>\n&gt; to go out.
