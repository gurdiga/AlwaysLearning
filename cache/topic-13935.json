To this day, she&#39;s still buying Forgive <br/>\n  and Forget type books and then not reading them.  She&#39;s never been able <br/>\n  to let it go and because of it, those men, all long dead, still continue <br/>\n  to manipulate and control her.  I believe she will carry her pain to her <br/>\n  own death and it breaks my heart that she&#39;s never been able to get past <br/>\n  it.  I&#39;m so glad Brianna has your strength and wisdom to deal with this <br/>\n  now, in her youth, so she can get on and live her life free of the pain. <br/>\n  She&#39;ll always have it in her memories, unfortunately, but she can be <br/>\n  free of the pain.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The fact that abuse often is from someone the child knows is a very hard <br/>\n  thing to teach children to be wary of.  I&#39;m definitely going to buy that <br/>\n  book everyone recommended.  So far all I&#39;ve done on this topic with the <br/>\n  girls is always made them aware that they own their bodies and if ANYONE <br/>\n  makes them feel uncomforable, they can always tell me without me being <br/>\n  upset with them.  I&#39;ve also encouraged them to trust their own feelings <br/>\n  about others.  But they are so little.  So I will continue to arm them <br/>\n  and myself with whatever weapons I can find.

She got pregnant when she was 15 with her <br/>\nboyfriend and gave the baby up for adoption. She never had the support <br/>\nof her mother, who prefered to act as none of it ever happened.  And to <br/>\nthis day the one person my mom blames more then anyone is her mother, <br/>\nbecause she could have stopped it but she never even tried.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, when my mom told my sister and I about her getting <br/>\npregnant as a teenager she told us she&#39;d been raped.  Years later, when <br/>\nmy half-sister found my mom and contacted her, then we found out that <br/>\nthe whole rape thing was made up for our benefit.  We were teenagers and <br/>\nI guess my mom didn&#39;t want us to know she&#39;s been having consentual (I <br/>\nthink that&#39;s the right word) sex. And she NEVER talked to us about sex <br/>\nbeyond telling us we had to wait until we were married.  The whole thing <br/>\nreally scewed her up.  Well, of course it did.  It&#39;s sickening!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;ve always maintained that my girls do not have trust family <br/>\nmembers just because they are family.  Trust is earned and if the girls <br/>\nsay they don&#39;t want to sit on someone&#39;s lap or go visit their house the <br/>\nanswer is ALWAYS okay.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have sons, but I think you did right by talking to Marty about <br/>\nit.  Men need to understand what can shape a woman&#39;s decisions about sex <br/>\nand that those decisions often are based on her self-esteem.   And girls <br/>\nneed to learn how not to become a victim through rape or the mental <br/>\nmanipulations that can be used on them when they are most succeptable, <br/>\nescpecially during the preteen and teen years when what their peers <br/>\nthink becomes so important.

I said maybe <br/>\n&gt;Marty should try to learn some compassion, because my sister went to bed with <br/>\n&gt;60 guys in two years after my parents divorced, and my sister had been raped <br/>\n&gt;at 14 by two older guys, at knifepoint, in an arroyo.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It was a lot to spring on Marty all at once, but I told him lots of girls who <br/>\n&gt;are promiscuous have been sexually abused by a male relative and they tend to <br/>\n&gt;use it as a means of relationship building or communication, so that &quot;slut&quot; <br/>\n&gt;was a harsh word to use about someone who was probably herself a victim.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;He was sobered by the whole conversation and honestly seems to have become a <br/>\n&gt;little more aware (not thinking of a word other than &quot;sober,&quot; quiet, <br/>\n&gt;thoughtful).   The girl broke up with Kirby which saved him a tux rental AND <br/>\n&gt;further high-school-style machinations.

To this day, she&#39;s still buying Forgive <br/>\nand Forget type books and then not reading them.  She&#39;s never been able <br/>\nto let it go and because of it, those men, all long dead, still continue <br/>\nto manipulate and control her.  I believe she will carry her pain to her <br/>\nown death and it breaks my heart that she&#39;s never been able to get past <br/>\nit.  I&#39;m so glad Brianna has your strength and wisdom to deal with this <br/>\nnow, in her youth, so she can get on and live her life free of the pain. <br/>\n She&#39;ll always have it in her memories, unfortunately, but she can be <br/>\nfree of the pain.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that abuse often is from someone the child knows is a very hard <br/>\nthing to teach children to be wary of.  I&#39;m definitely going to buy that <br/>\nbook everyone recommended.  So far all I&#39;ve done on this topic with the <br/>\ngirls is always made them aware that they own their bodies and if ANYONE <br/>\nmakes them feel uncomforable, they can always tell me without me being <br/>\nupset with them.  I&#39;ve also encouraged them to trust their own feelings <br/>\nabout others.  But they are so little.  So I will continue to arm them <br/>\nand myself with whatever weapons I can find.

We live in a <br/>\nsmall town in western NY and so many people think we need not worry so <br/>\nmuch here.  But I think that in the minds of these sick perverts, small <br/>\ntowns are perfect preying grounds because parents are more lax. <br/>\n Everyday, I see very young children out on sidewalks all alone and I <br/>\npray for their safety.  I know I&#39;m paranoid but it&#39;s justified, I think. <br/>\n A friend of mine was in a mall near here with her 4 and a man tried to <br/>\ngrab her dd and she was RIGHT THERE.  So how easy would it be to grab a <br/>\ndefendless child off a sidewalk or out of a yard?  The trick is what to <br/>\ntell the children without scaring the hell out of them.  What do you <br/>\ntell your kids about kidnappers and molesters?

This should have a been a<br/>\nmatter of good senses.  Say that you baby child has just slept and you<br/>\nneeded to go to the drugstore across the street. You go.  It will not take<br/>\nmore than 4 min. (It might not be a case of Cupertino in CA, where it is<br/>\nunlike that you would live in a place that there is a drugstore across the<br/>\nstreet!)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen dd was 5 yo, I would let her home alone and go for groceries one block<br/>\nfm our apartment.  I never left her alone while she was asleep.  I would<br/>\nmake sure that she were awaken and that she knew that I would go for the<br/>\nerrands.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that she is 8 yo, she goes by herself to the supermarket, one block fm<br/>\nour apartment. She goes on her bicycle to her piano lessons, 7 blocks fm<br/>\napartment.  She tells me that she is going out to play with xx friend and do<br/>\nnot come back until the 6 o&#39;clock nationwide chime. The loudspeakers  tell<br/>\nchildren that it is time to go home and ask the nearby adults to remind the<br/>\nchildren that it time to go home. (During the winter, the loudspeakers are<br/>\nturned on at 5 PM.  It is nationwide and these loudspeakers are placed in<br/>\nvarious public places.  It was set to serve as messenger in case of a<br/>\nemergency, like earthquake, and the system is daily tested by these calls. )<br/>\n<br/>\nHere in Japan, parents are not allowed to take their children to elementary<br/>\nschool.  They are grouped and march to school by themselves.  And comeback<br/>\nhome by themselves too.  If they have to cross a busy road/street, parents<br/>\ntake turns in the mornings to help the children cross the busy roads.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile at public daycare&#39;s centers parents are supposed to take and pick up<br/>\ntheir children.  They will only registered people at the center to pick up<br/>\nthe children.   Though the very next day that these same children begin<br/>\nattending the elementary school, parents can&#39;t be with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt first it was a choke to me. In Brazil many parents take their high school<br/>\nchildren to and fm school.  The city streets are to violent.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is hard for foreigners to understand why children here are left to run<br/>\naround its neighborhood at the young age of 6/7 yo. It takes time to let its<br/>\nown children to do the same, even if the children were 9 or 10 yo.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is Tokyo, capital of Japan.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14002,"nextTopicId":13979}}
