Three different online places, I was getting <br/>\njumped, by people who either knew nothing about unschooling (on the New <br/>\nMexico list) or people who were new to it and not getting it to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nRough.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd today, because of a private correspondence, I was going to look something <br/>\nup about James Dobson&#39;s stuff.  Yeek.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I found was worse.  It was someone going on about how Dobson doesn&#39;t go <br/>\nfar enough, that he&#39;s a total wimp and violator of the Bible.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo rather than stir a peaceful Christian neighborhood (there&#39;s a batch of new <br/>\nparticipants at unschooling-dotcom who are Christian), I brought it here.   <br/>\nIt seems it&#39;s useful for activists and volunteer-types in general to know <br/>\nthese bizarre things sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nOH!  But first, I wanted to say that if any of you have favorite <br/>\nanti-spanking testimonials or want to write me something, I&#39;m going to do an <br/>\nanti-spanking webpage kind of like the video games page--links to donated <br/>\npages or other good sites, with enough information on the front page that <br/>\nit&#39;s not JUST a list of links.  Not so much that people will be overwhelmed <br/>\nand go away.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd another thing (I&#39;m not organized this moment):  below is also something <br/>\nfrom the same article about Mother Teresa.  It seems really funny to me, but <br/>\nthen I remember the author was probably kinda frothing at the mouth just <br/>\nthinking about it, and that unfortunately he&#39;s not an isolated nutcase.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo on to Spanking Teens:<br/>\n<br/>\n(whole article is here:  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/dobson/general.htm\">http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/dobson/general.htm</a> )<br/>\n<br/>\n+++++quote starts+++++<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the Q&A section of the book, one of the questions was &quot;Should teenage <br/>\nchildren be spanked for disobedience or rudeness?&quot; Dr. James Dobson, the <br/>\nself-proclaimed child-rearing expert, answered thusly:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;No. Teens desperately want to be thought of as adults and they deeply resent <br/>\nbeing treated as children. Spanking is the ultimate insult at that age and <br/>\nthey are justified in hating it. Besides, it doesn&#39;t work.&quot;<br/>\nOn what authority should teens not be spanked? -- Dr. Dobson&#39;s? And do we <br/>\ngovern our lives by what teens &quot;want&quot; or by what the Bible teaches? If teens <br/>\nresent being treated like children, then they shouldn&#39;t act like children. <br/>\nAnd if spanking is the ultimate insult for a teenager, then this is evidence <br/>\nit must work very effectively in deterring the rebellious actions that bring <br/>\nthe rod. And finally, by saying &quot;it doesn&#39;t work,&quot; Dobson is calling God a <br/>\nliar (cf. Prov. 22:15 -- Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, but the <br/>\nrod of discipline will drive it far from him.)! God says spanking does work <br/>\n(and He doesn&#39;t even give an age limit -- cf. Prov. 19:18 -- Discipline your <br/>\nson, while there is hope; do not be a willing party to his death).<br/>\n<br/>\n                                    ------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n(c) In the 11/89 issue of FOTF&#39;s Clubhouse magazine for children, a smiling <br/>\n&quot;Mother&quot; Teresa was on the cover, and the lead article was entitled, &quot;Teresa <br/>\nof Calcutta: Little Woman with a Big Heart.&quot; The readers of this magazine <br/>\nwere made to think that Mother Teresa was a genuine New Testament Christian <br/>\nand that she was doing a great work for God through her Sisters of Charities <br/>\nmission. &quot;Mother&quot; Teresa was, in reality, a New Age pantheist who considered <br/>\nBuddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and other religions all to be acceptable ways to <br/>\nGod. This is a great deception. She also preached the false sacramental <br/>\ngospel of Rome and had given multitudes of people a false comfort by <br/>\nencouraging them to place their hopes in such vanities as the Roman Catholic <br/>\nmass and the Roman Catholic Mary.
