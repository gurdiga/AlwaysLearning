I wasn&#39;t all that active before I got it, but I&#39;ve <br/>\nheard that a lot of people were.  At least she can know inside herself that <br/>\nit is *not* a matter of laziness.  I often battle that myself.  How much is <br/>\nthe fibro and how much is my own dislike of exercise?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I think it might take a while for her to find a new passion.  She loved <br/>\n&gt;writing, but is very reluctant to keep journals now.  Maybe it brings her <br/>\n&gt;too face to face with her illness.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe journals are not the right kind of writing for her at this <br/>\ntime.  Maybe she&#39;d enjoy writing stories or poetry or something.  This <br/>\nwould be a good time to do lots of &quot;strewing&quot; with her.  Maybe offer her <br/>\nbooks and videos about various crafts (like the weaving suggestion).  Find <br/>\ninteresting books on topics that used to interest her even a little, <br/>\ninternet sites.  It really will help if she can get her mind on other <br/>\nthings.  It doesn&#39;t take the pain or fatigue away, but can make it easier <br/>\nto bear.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&lt;&lt;for me that is the best way to deal<br/>\n&gt;with chronic pain...to remove yourself from it as much<br/>\n&gt;as you can. Think about other things, other people,<br/>\n&gt;ideas outside of ones own body. Doing, thinking,<br/>\n&gt;creating, laughing.......and yes, a pain med to help<br/>\n&gt;over a hump, because sometimes the pain is too<br/>\n&gt;demanding to even attempt to ignore and there are<br/>\n&gt;things to be done anyway.  Like living. :-) &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&lt;&lt;It can be really hard to find the balance.  (I&#39;m still working on it.)  It<br/>\n&gt;*is* important to move, but it&#39;s also important to listen to your<br/>\n&gt;body.  For your daughter, it might start out as simple exercises done in<br/>\n&gt;bed, *very* gently and gradually&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;She seems so resistant to trying anything.  Maybe because it is all so <br/>\n&gt;new.  I&#39;m not sure I know the exact differences between fibro and CFS, but <br/>\n&gt;I think my daughter may have a couple of the CFS symptoms.  She says she <br/>\n&gt;is fatigued, but I don&#39;t know if she is using the term accurately.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote> From what I can tell, fibro and CFS are almost exactly alike.  The <br/>\ndifferences are that people with fibro have the tender points, and people <br/>\nwith CFS get sore throats and swollen glands.  I&#39;ve got both of those, even <br/>\nthough I&#39;ve only been diagnosed with fibro.  Other than that, you&#39;ll find <br/>\nmuch the same list of symptoms for both, especially fatigue and pain.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fatigue for me is a lack of stamina.  I can still run if I have to . . <br/>\n. but only for a minute or so, and then I&#39;d be wiped for the day.  Any kind <br/>\nof upward movement is difficult, from walking up hills or stairs to getting <br/>\nmyself up from sitting or squatting.  From what I&#39;ve read, it seems to have <br/>\nsomething to do with the muscles not getting the oxygen they need, or not <br/>\nprocessing it properly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;She can and does get up occasionally to walk downstairs to her room to get <br/>\n&gt;something needed.  She is no worse afterwards.  But a trip to the dr&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;office makes her pain worse.  She still has no problem getting up to use <br/>\n&gt;the bathroom, though.  I don&#39;t need to help her shower.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have no trouble moving around the house, etc., but a trip to the store is <br/>\ntiring.  The day I go to town (1 hour drive, stops at library, grocery <br/>\nstores, and maybe other errands) completely fries me.  I try not to plan <br/>\nanything at all for that evening.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;It is so hard to understand exactly how someone else feels.  I guess all I <br/>\n&gt;can do is give her this advice, and be there for support as she discovers <br/>\n&gt;her limits on her own.  I think this is the most respectful approach.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes.  Keep encouraging her to find ways to move without making her feel <br/>\nguilty for not taking your advice.  Some people say that doing Tai Chi <br/>\nhelps them a lot.  I haven&#39;t tried it yet.  Apparently you can do it at <br/>\nyour own level, even sitting down if need be.  It&#39;s definitely a gentle <br/>\nform of exercise, and with her background she might find it easy to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;She already gets enough disrespect from doctors who don&#39;t really <br/>\n&gt;understand, although they claim to.  They use phrases such as:  &quot;She has <br/>\n&gt;failed all medications.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s such a dumb way to put it.  You can explain to her that what it <br/>\nreally means is that the medications have failed *her*.  In other words, <br/>\nthey didn&#39;t work for her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Or, &quot;I suspect she is fighting the effects of the medicine.&quot;  Or, &quot;I think <br/>\n&gt;her mental state is making the pain seem worse than it is.&quot;  He suggested <br/>\n&gt;we see a psychologist that runs a pain management clinic, and after <br/>\n&gt;speaking with him I learned he uses techniques such as self-hypnosis and <br/>\n&gt;relaxation to help deal with pain.  This sounded great, but then I read <br/>\n&gt;some literature he sent, which mentioned his research into the mind/body <br/>\n&gt;connection, and now I am worried he is assuming Tiffany is contributing to <br/>\n&gt;her own illness.  The GP that referred us already consulted with him prior <br/>\n&gt;to the appointment.  The one who made the above remarks.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There *is* a mind/body connection.  But that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s all in her <br/>\nhead.  This guy might be able to help her, but I&#39;d suggest talking with him <br/>\nfurther before she sees him.  Get it really clear that he&#39;s not going to <br/>\nhit her with &quot;It&#39;s all in your head.&quot;  Yes, what&#39;s in our heads does affect <br/>\nhow we feel, but there&#39;s biochemical stuff going on in the first <br/>\nplace.  Here&#39;s something I just got on another homeschooling list (where <br/>\nwe&#39;re also discussing fibro).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.med.umich.edu/opm/newspage/2002/fibromyalgia.htm\">http://www.med.umich.edu/opm/newspage/2002/fibromyalgia.htm</a><br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;Fibromyalgia pain isn&#39;t all in patients&#39; heads, new brain study finds<br/>\n &gt;fMRI scans give first objective measure of mysterious ailment, provide road<br/>\n &gt;map for future study<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;ANN ARBOR, MI - A new brain-scan study confirms scientifically what<br/>\n &gt;fibromyalgia patients have been telling a skeptical medical community for<br/>\n &gt;years: They&#39;re really in pain.<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;In fact, the study finds, people with fibromyalgia say they feel severe<br/>\n &gt;pain, and have measurable pain signals in their brains, from a gentle<br/>\n &gt;finger squeeze that barely feels unpleasant to people without the disease.<br/>\n &gt;The squeeze&#39;s force must be doubled to cause healthy people to feel the<br/>\n &gt;same level of pain - and their pain signals show up in different brain areas.<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;The results, published in the current issue of Arthritis & Rheumatism, the<br/>\n &gt;journal of the American College of Rheumatology, may offer the proof of<br/>\n &gt;fibromyalgia&#39;s physical roots that many doubtful physicians have sought.

I watched kids at the hospital slowly dying of cancer and others <br/>\nwith neurological problems so severe that their parents didn&#39;t even visit <br/>\nanymore.

Poor Tiffany.<br/>\nPoor Mama.  She is NOT doing to herself!!! She didn&#39;t<br/>\nearn this and it isn&#39;t bad karma. It just is. <br/>\n<br/>\nThose &quot;pain management techniques&quot; are because the<br/>\ndocs are concerned about pain-med addiction.  It is a<br/>\nvalid concern. But, if  or have a root canal, you get<br/>\nsome relief, without asking, but if you have something<br/>\nthat hurts worse, but doesn&#39;t have a foreseeable<br/>\nending, you get zilch. You are supposed to improve<br/>\nyour meditation techniques. I would suggest asking for<br/>\nsomething for menstrual cramps....really bad<br/>\nones..describe the abdominal spasms and<br/>\nheadaches....bloating isn&#39;t the problem (so they don&#39;t<br/>\ninclude a diuretic) tell them Tylenol just doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhelp.....and save it for the REAL pain.  Knowing that<br/>\nyou have something to help a little bit, if ou need<br/>\nit, does push the unbearable threshold back some.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI broke a foot a few of years ago, and was given a<br/>\nprescription for some pain-meds.  &quot;Good grief&quot; I<br/>\nthought, &quot;this little ding is nothing, and it is going<br/>\nto get better in a few weeks&quot; It really did hurt, and<br/>\nit LOOKED bad. &quot;If this is what is unbearable ,<br/>\naccording to the doc, then why should I have to put up<br/>\nwith this other all the time?&quot;  I saved the meds for<br/>\nwhen I just couldn&#39;t overcome my pain induced inertia,<br/>\nand called in the prescription for renewal. Over and<br/>\nover.  I have to do a liver-function test every 6<br/>\nmonths, now.  After about two years  I had to go to<br/>\nthe doctor and justify myself.  It was sort of<br/>\nobvious.  But.  Relief was NEVER OFFERED for chronic<br/>\npain. I had to insist.  And also had to point out that<br/>\nthere were times when it peaked that needed extra<br/>\nrelief. Perhaps as a mother you can advocate for her?<br/>\n<br/>\nA sympathetic neurologist is most likely to help. But<br/>\nthey are into all sort of tests.  Dunno if they do all<br/>\nthe neuropathy tests for Fibro that they do for MS,<br/>\nbut after one series, I got off the table and told &#39;em<br/>\n&quot;NO&quot;. And I&#39;m not taking any more nuclear waste for<br/>\ncontrast MRIs either.  There is only so much<br/>\nradioactivity that a body can tolerate.

After an<br/>\n&quot;inconclusive&quot; lumbar puncture, I refused to have it<br/>\nredone. One&#39;s enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes Tiffany like weaving?  A lap or table loom is<br/>\nfun. On a weaving list (that I used to be on....it was<br/>\nvery active) there were a couple of weavers with CFS<br/>\nand they found it soothing to sit in a recliner near a<br/>\nwindow and weave.  Beautiful things they did too. No<br/>\nrush. Just weave as the spirit moved them. Used those<br/>\nplastic &quot;childrens&quot; needles and yarn. Just a thought.<br/>\nI use rag strips to make things......<br/>\n<br/>\nSharon of the Swamp<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com\">http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":4754561,"authorName":"Lisa Breger","from":"&quot;Lisa Breger&quot; &lt;lisa@...&gt;","profile":"lisabreger","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"more on fibro and chronic pain","postDate":"1023675512","msgId":7527,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjkwMWMyMTAyNSQxZWE0MTdhMCQ2NzAwYThjMEBsaXNhPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":7528,"prevInTime":7526,"nextInTime":7528,"topicId":7527,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Her passion prior to fibro was gymnastics.  She","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1701263097\">&lt;&lt;Encourage her to find her passion for life again. It is a vital part of coping with any chronic <br/>\ncondition.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHer passion prior to fibro was gymnastics.  She was a competitive gymnast and a dancer, very active and vibrant.  I think it might take a while for her to find a new passion.  She loved writing, but is very reluctant to keep journals now.  Maybe it brings her too face to face with her illness.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;for me that is the best way to deal<br/>\nwith chronic pain...to remove yourself from it as much<br/>\nas you can. Think about other things, other people,<br/>\nideas outside of ones own body. Doing, thinking,<br/>\ncreating, laughing.......and yes, a pain med to help<br/>\nover a hump, because sometimes the pain is too<br/>\ndemanding to even attempt to ignore and there are<br/>\nthings to be done anyway.  Like living. :-) &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI admire you.  I don&#39;t know how I would be able to deal with chronic pain, so I&#39;ll copy these wise words and send them to my daughter to read.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;It can be really hard to find the balance.  (I&#39;m still working on it.)  It <br/>\n*is* important to move, but it&#39;s also important to listen to your <br/>\nbody.  For your daughter, it might start out as simple exercises done in <br/>\nbed, *very* gently and gradually&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe seems so resistant to trying anything.  Maybe because it is all so new.  I&#39;m not sure I know the exact differences between fibro and CFS, but I think my daughter may have a couple of the CFS symptoms.  She says she is fatigued, but I don&#39;t know if she is using the term accurately.  She can and does get up occasionally to walk downstairs to her room to get something needed.  She is no worse afterwards.  But a trip to the dr&#39;s office makes her pain worse.  She still has no problem getting up to use the bathroom, though.  I don&#39;t need to help her shower.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;So, yes, she should be as active as she *can*, but I certainly wouldn&#39;t tell<br/>\nher to push through her pain.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is so hard to understand exactly how someone else feels.  I guess all I can do is give her this advice, and be there for support as she discovers her limits on her own.  I think this is the most respectful approach.  She already gets enough disrespect from doctors who don&#39;t really understand, although they claim to.  They use phrases such as:  &quot;She has failed all medications.&quot;  Or, &quot;I suspect she is fighting the effects of the medicine.&quot;  Or, &quot;I think her mental state is making the pain seem worse than it is.&quot;  He suggested we see a psychologist that runs a pain management clinic, and after speaking with him I learned he uses techniques such as self-hypnosis and relaxation to help deal with pain.  This sounded great, but then I read some literature he sent, which mentioned his research into the mind/body connection, and now I am worried he is assuming Tiffany is contributing to her own illness.  The GP that referred us already consulted with him prior to the appointment.  The one who made the above remarks.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I had friends who lost children to terminal illness or<br/>\naccidents.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nA nice reminder that we do have a lot to be grateful for;  There is always someone worse off, and we still have the capability to help others in some way. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I have to tell Roy, that I just can&#39;t do it....I feel<br/>\nso ashamed then, and I pray, inside, that Roy learns<br/>\ncompassion rather than feeling deprived. Though I fear<br/>\nit is both.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYour love for your son is so evident, I can feel it in your words.  We are all deprived at times, but your son KNOWS you love him.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople with fibro and other chronic pain illnesses are some of the nicest people I have met, off or on-line!  And they know so much more about the illnesses than the doctors.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy your evening!<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\nLisa Breger<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lisa@...\">lisa@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9415,"nextTopicId":9360}}
