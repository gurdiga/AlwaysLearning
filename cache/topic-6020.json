Very needy.  Wants to be <br/>\nmy ankle bone!!  Jumpy like a JR and talks in moans, whines, and barks quite <br/>\na bit.  Our other dog is the *greatest*.  Baxter is a medium-sized Boston <br/>\nTerrier.  They come in small, med, and lg.  Small is about 10-12 pounds.  Med <br/>\n= around 15 pounds, and  Lg = about 20 lbs.  He&#39;s sweet, very trainable, and <br/>\nthe perfect lap size.  The buggy eyes bother some folks, but I just love him. <br/>\n DH is allergic to cats and most fluffy dogs.  If we ever do get a bigger <br/>\ndog, I am hoping for a Weimaraner or a Boxer.  I&#39;d also go for a snake, <br/>\niguana, or parrot.<br/>\n<br/>\nOldest DD wants a turtle, horse, hamster, ferret, rabbit...anything that is <br/>\n&quot;just mine&quot;.  Younger DD just wants a mouse (those &quot;fancy mice&quot; are sooo <br/>\ncute, but I am afraid they&#39;d be stepped on or worse) or hamster.  I am sure <br/>\nwhen they get older, we will be having more than our share of pets.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiAnna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Digest Number 302","postDate":"1017968067","msgId":6020,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNiLjI0OTg4M2ZhLjI5ZGU0ZmMzQGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":6025,"prevInTime":6019,"nextInTime":6021,"topicId":6020,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/4/02 6:02:57 PM Central Standard Time, AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-762102669\">In a message dated 4/4/02 6:02:57 PM Central Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve ever seen a bluebird. <br/>\n  Are they more common in other parts of the countr &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess so. We get bluebirds regularly from April through June...I guess they <br/>\njust pass through on their way north. The Eastern Bluebirds are what we get <br/>\nhere in Pensacola...pretty little things.
