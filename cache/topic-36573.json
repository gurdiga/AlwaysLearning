Jeffrey","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-355339154\">My kids and I need some fresh new ideas to get us out of a rut.  We&#39;re <br/>\nbored and want some fun things to do close to home as money is a little <br/>\ntight.  Jeffrey just had a birthday.  He&#39;s 12 and he got lots of new <br/>\nLego kits and video games.  Allie (10) and I treated ourselves to some <br/>\nnew Legos and video games too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband asked me to try to get on a better schedule for him.  The <br/>\nkids and I were staying up late and then sleeping late.  We did great <br/>\nfor a while but we&#39;ve drifted back into our old schedule.  There&#39;s <br/>\nsomething very appealing at being awake until 2:00am.  I am trying to <br/>\nexplain to my DH that the kids are busy doing their own things during <br/>\nthe day hours and at night after he goes to bed, I absolutely love the <br/>\ntime I have with Jeffrey and Allie.  We watch tv, read books, and play <br/>\ngames.  My DH doesn&#39;t understand why we can&#39;t have that togetherness <br/>\nduring day hours.  I think it&#39;s because they can do anything during the <br/>\nday but we have to be mostly quiet after he has gone to bed.  Our home <br/>\nis really small and this is how we&#39;ve adapted to living together.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36486,"nextTopicId":36579}}
