I don&#39;t think that <br/>\nthey&#39;re likely to just pick it up unless someone takes the time to explain it <br/>\nto them and help them do it a little - so it won&#39;t be naturally in that <br/>\nsense. It isn&#39;t any different than learning to ride a bike, though. They see <br/>\na reason to do it (that seems natural, to me, but if it doesn&#39;t to you, then <br/>\nit could be this step is the stumbling block), they see other people doing <br/>\nit, they decide they want to try it, they might try it on their own based on <br/>\nwhat they&#39;ve seen other people doing and that might work or it might not, <br/>\nthey may ask for help, they may flounder a bit and someone may step in and <br/>\noffer help, or someone might just step in early in this whole process and <br/>\nsay, &quot;Do you want me to help you learn that?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey can learn multiplication when they find they need to add the same number <br/>\nover and over... 8+8+8+8+8 etc. I mean - they can just use a calculator for <br/>\nthat, too -- nothing wrong with that. But even punching in 8+8+8+8+8+8 etc <br/>\ninto a calculator is a pain - you can forget how many eights you already <br/>\npunched in or you can accidentally hit the wrong key and have to start all <br/>\nthe way over, etc. Teaching multiplication BEFORE a kid has experienced any <br/>\nsort of frustration with repeated addition is sort of silly since the kid <br/>\nwon&#39;t appreciate why multiplication is useful and it&#39;ll just seem like <br/>\nanother operation to learn just for its own sake.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - they can learn division, too, the same way. When they find they are <br/>\ndoing repeated subtraction. When Roxana wanted to go to New York City to see <br/>\nCats on Broadway, she asked me how far it was and how far we could drive in a <br/>\nday - she wanted to figure out how many days it would take to drive there and <br/>\nback. So she started with 3,000 and started subtracting 350 miles, over and <br/>\nover, to see how many times she&#39;d have to subtract it to cover all 3,000 <br/>\nmiles. She made a mistake somewhere and realized she needed to start ALL over <br/>\nand she groaned aloud. I was walking by and I said, &quot;I can show you a <br/>\nshortcut way to do that.&quot; She wanted to learn, so I should her some simple <br/>\ndivision like 6 divided by 3 and then 60 divided by 3 and then 69 divided by <br/>\n3 and then 69 divided by 23 and so on until she could do 3,000 divided by <br/>\n350. It took about 20 minutes or so. She was THRILLED and even asked for more <br/>\nproblems to practice on. THEN I told her, &quot;This is long division&quot; and she <br/>\nsaid, &quot;I can&#39;t believe it - why do people say that they hate it, this is so <br/>\nconvenient.&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how you can MAKE such a situation happen in your home - how you <br/>\ncan make it come up naturally like that. It has to do with the parent being <br/>\naware of the kids&#39; interests and focus and stuff like that. In some ways, <br/>\nthis is really hard work - it doesn&#39;t seem like it to those of us who just <br/>\nsort of do it naturally, but I know that to my mom and my sisters it looks <br/>\nlike hard work for me to always be thinking things like, &quot;Oh, I wonder if <br/>\nthat would be something Roxana (or Rosie or Roya) would be interested in - <br/>\nand remembering to introduce her to it.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI think our society is in a strange sort of place - we have so much <br/>\nopportunity - such enriched environments - that we can just pass on formal <br/>\nschooling and live in our stimulating and wonderful environments with <br/>\nattentive and doting parents who focus on supporting their own kids&#39; learning <br/>\nand our kids can do ANYTHING with it.  In the past or in other places, kids <br/>\ndid the same thing - learned by hangin&#39; out with the important adults in <br/>\ntheir lives - but the expectations were that they would end up DOING mostly <br/>\nwhat the adults in their lives did. Our expectations are so different - we <br/>\nexpect our kids to find their own way, not follow in our footsteps, and we <br/>\nexpect and they expect that they&#39;ll find stimulating, fulfilling, work that <br/>\nmakes them truly happy, not just develop skills so that they can be <br/>\nproductive members of society and support themselves and maybe their own <br/>\nfamily. It is pretty amazing to live in a time and place where we have the <br/>\nluxury to do this. And I can see why it is scary and seems way too risky to <br/>\nlots of people.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2294225,"authorName":"freeform@juno.com","from":"freeform@...","profile":"freeform_ca","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] woops - I apologize and let me explain ....","postDate":"1016730270","msgId":5685,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwMzIxLjA5NTAxMC4tNzcyMTAzLjAuZnJlZWZvcm1AanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5657,"nextInTopic":5698,"prevInTime":5684,"nextInTime":5686,"topicId":5634,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On Thu, 21 Mar 2002 05:46:20 -0700 zenmomma *  ...

First, Rosie WANTED to do the worksheets and play school and <br/>\n&gt; she was <br/>\n&gt;&gt; totally HAPPY doing it. She was not disturbed in the LEAST by the <br/>\n&gt; fact that <br/>\n&gt;&gt; she got all the math problems wrong and all the spelling words <br/>\n&gt; wrong except <br/>\n&gt;&gt; one. She gets it that she&#39;s not learning the same stuff at the same <br/>\n&gt; time as <br/>\n&gt;&gt; every other kid and that she knows more about some things and they <br/>\n&gt; know more <br/>\n&gt;&gt; other things. Also - I misunderstood about the mom grading the <br/>\n&gt; problems, the <br/>\n&gt;&gt; kids graded each other - the mom gave them the answers to do it <br/>\n&gt; with, I <br/>\n&gt;&gt; guess. Anyway, that wasn&#39;t really relevant - it didn&#39;t bother Rosie <br/>\n&gt; to have <br/>\n&gt;&gt; her papers graded, it was part of what they were playing - she was <br/>\n&gt; ENJOYING <br/>\n&gt;&gt; it. No problem at all there.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; My point was that if you&#39;re unschooling, you have to be aware that <br/>\n&gt; your kids <br/>\n&gt;&gt; may get into these situations where they openly demonstrate that <br/>\n&gt; they clearly <br/>\n&gt;&gt; don&#39;t know what other kids of their exact age are being taught and <br/>\n&gt; it could <br/>\n&gt;&gt; be embarrassing or upsetting - to the kid or to the parents. COULD <br/>\n&gt; be!!! <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Wasn&#39;t at all in our case.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; The point I was trying to make was unschoolers come to a problem <br/>\n&gt; late, but <br/>\n&gt;&gt; with a maturity of thought that school schedule doesn&#39;t allow. When <br/>\n&gt; I said <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Rosie can think more clearly than the other girl - I was thinking <br/>\n&gt; about the <br/>\n&gt;&gt; opportunity she has to think more clearly about the stuff before <br/>\n&gt; she learns <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&quot;&quot; it. I didn&#39;t mean she just thinks more clearly, in general, <br/>\n&gt; about <br/>\n&gt;&gt; anything and everything. Here is an example of what I was thinking <br/>\n&gt; about <br/>\n&gt;&gt; (none too clearly, myself, given how very badly I expressed it):<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; When my older daughter was about 6 or 7, she had a friend (Mary) <br/>\n&gt; who had an <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&quot;&quot; in <br/>\n&gt; school. He <br/>\n&gt;&gt; apparently practiced, out loud, so much that Mary memorized them <br/>\n&gt; too. Much <br/>\n&gt;&gt; was made over this by their teacher - a 1st grader knowing all her <br/>\n&gt;&gt; multiplication facts - very exciting.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&quot;&quot; for some 4th <br/>\n&gt; graders <br/>\n&gt;&gt; and Mary was part of it. One day I heard one of the other girls <br/>\n&gt; explaining to <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Mary that multiplication was really just a shortcut for doing <br/>\n&gt; repeated <br/>\n&gt;&gt; addition. This was clearly a new concept to Mary -- she&#39;d learned <br/>\n&gt; to DO <br/>\n&gt;&gt; multiplication so young that she hadn&#39;t been able to really think <br/>\n&gt; clearly <br/>\n&gt;&gt; about it at that time and, since then, she&#39;d just done it without <br/>\n&gt; giving it <br/>\n&gt;&gt; any thought and had, apparently, never realized that multiplication <br/>\n&gt; was <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&quot;&quot; operation, but just another way to do <br/>\n&gt; addition. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Contrast that to how an unschooled child I know learned <br/>\n&gt; multiplication. She <br/>\n&gt;&gt; added and added, she would add 8+8+8+8+8+8+8 for example, two <br/>\n&gt; numbers at a <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&quot;Every time I want to add up seven <br/>\n&gt; eights, it is <br/>\n&gt;&gt; always going to be 56 so I can just say that seven eights is fifty-<br/>\n&gt; six and <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&quot;Yep. And if you <br/>\n&gt; want, you can <br/>\n&gt;&gt; just do the same thing for lots of numbers, like four fives or <br/>\n&gt; three nines or <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot; says the child - that is very cool. <br/>\n&gt;&quot;I can <br/>\n&gt;&gt; show you how to make a table so you can do it for all the numbers <br/>\n&gt; from 1 to <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&quot; So they did that and the <br/>\n&gt; child <br/>\n&gt;&gt; memorized the multiplication facts because she was THRILLEd with <br/>\n&gt; the concept <br/>\n&gt;&gt; of being able to do addition so quickly.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Now, this is a simple example, most people (but not all, by any <br/>\n&gt; means), come <br/>\n&gt;&gt; to realize that multiplication is really repeated addition, pretty <br/>\n&gt; quickly. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; However, take more difficult concepts and apply the same approach. <br/>\n&gt; How many <br/>\n&gt;&gt; adults can quickly and easily explain why dividing one fraction by <br/>\n&gt; another <br/>\n&gt;&gt; gives an answer that is BIGGER, not smaller. Why is 1/2 divided by <br/>\n&gt; 1/4 equal <br/>\n&gt;&gt; to 2? Most adults will say because you get it by inverting and <br/>\n&gt; multiplying so <br/>\n&gt;&gt; 1/2 divided by 1/4 becomes 1/2 times 4/1 which is 4/2 which is 2. <br/>\n&gt; BUT that is <br/>\n&gt;&gt; just a technique to DO it, not an explanation of the underlying <br/>\n&gt; concept. What <br/>\n&gt;&gt; are you really doing when you divide one fraction by another? <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&quot;To divide one fraction by another you invert <br/>\n&gt; and <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&quot; and make them practice doing it over and over, then that <br/>\n&gt; may very <br/>\n&gt;&gt; likely be as clear as their thinking ever gets about that. But if <br/>\n&gt; you wait <br/>\n&gt;&gt; until it comes up in some interesting relevant context where they <br/>\n&gt; really need <br/>\n&gt;&gt; to or want to divide one fraction by another and take THAT <br/>\n&gt; opportunity to <br/>\n&gt;&gt; investigate and understand it - then the child will be able to <br/>\n&gt; think about it <br/>\n&gt;&gt; more clearly. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; The time that some kids spend doing worksheets will be time that <br/>\n&gt; unschooled <br/>\n&gt;&gt; kids spend doing other things. The other things are not likely to <br/>\n&gt; be things <br/>\n&gt;&gt; that would show up in testing, for example, for kids that age. As I <br/>\n&gt; said, 5th <br/>\n&gt;&gt; graders are not getting tested on world geography, for example. <br/>\n&gt; This is a <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&quot;&quot; curriculum <br/>\n&gt; stuff - either <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&quot;&quot; to <br/>\n&gt; do it and, <br/>\n&gt;&gt; heck, I&#39;ll even admit that could be the best choice for their <br/>\n&gt; family and <br/>\n&gt;&gt; maybe I&#39;m making a terrible mistake not doing it too. I&#39;m not <br/>\n&gt; omniscient and <br/>\n&gt;&gt; can&#39;t predict the future. However, IF someone is going to unschool -<br/>\n&gt;  then <br/>\n&gt;&gt; their kids get to learn things on their own timetable and I really <br/>\n&gt; believe <br/>\n&gt;&gt; that one of the huge benefits is that, when they DO learn things, <br/>\n&gt; they do it <br/>\n&gt;&gt; because of their own choice/interest and that is conducive to more <br/>\n&gt; clear <br/>\n&gt;&gt; thinking, more focus, more in-depth understanding, of what they are <br/>\n&gt; learning.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; I hope that makes more sense.

They don&#39;t see at all the MANY things my <br/>\nkids know about that their kids have never even heard of or considered.  And <br/>\nI hear from my kids sometimes, their surprise that other kids their age or <br/>\nolder don&#39;t know ANYTHING about ___ (Thailand / chain mail / polar bears / <br/>\nchess / whatever it might have been that came up in conversation or play and <br/>\nthe other kids said &quot;What?&quot; about).<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly does not read fluently.  But in the past few days we have had <br/>\nconversations about the history of England *because* she asked about <br/>\nspellings.  Why two words that sounded the same looked so different.  And <br/>\nshe&#39;s totally onto the fact that words from Greek will use &quot;ch&quot; to sound like <br/>\n&quot;k&quot; and &quot;ph&quot; to do &quot;f.&quot;  So if she wants to spell something I can say &quot;It&#39;s <br/>\nGreek,&quot; and she says, &quot;So &#39;ch,&#39; like &#39;Christ&#39;?&quot; or something.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHow many first graders learning to spell by writing each word ten times in <br/>\npreparation for a spelling test on Friday are going to wonder about such <br/>\nthings, or care?

So I wrote it down.  She said six <br/>\nletters for one syllable was too much.  I told her &quot;thought&quot; was worse.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe talked about ski and skate later in the car, being from Norse.  That came <br/>\nfrom discussing onomatopoeia. (I had to look up the spelling, and won&#39;t even <br/>\nTHINK of confusing Holly with THAT much Greek.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOnomatopoeia came from a discussion with Marty the day before about &quot;Whoosh&quot; <br/>\nsounding like &quot;whoosh&quot; and &quot;pop...&quot; and I said &quot;There&#39;s a word for words that <br/>\nsound like the thing they name.&quot;  So we discussed that &quot;quack&quot; and &quot;bow wow&quot; <br/>\nand &quot;meow&quot; which we think of as copying that animal&#39;s sound aren&#39;t the same <br/>\nin all languages.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a lot of language discussion for 24 hours for someone who can&#39;t even <br/>\nread.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSO I could easily say that in and around spelling and language, Holly <br/>\nunderstands much more than the kids her age who learned to read &quot;by the <br/>\nbook,&quot; and on schedule.  When they&#39;re fifteen those kids might also have <br/>\npicked up a lot of linguistic history and terminology and there will be no <br/>\ndifference.  But at the moment, Holly is coming at the whole reading and <br/>\nspelling thing with an analytical viewpoint most beginners don&#39;t have at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like it.

First, Rosie WANTED to do the worksheets and play school and <br/>\nshe was <br/>\n&gt; totally HAPPY doing it. She was not disturbed in the LEAST by the <br/>\nfact that <br/>\n&gt; she got all the math problems wrong and all the spelling words <br/>\nwrong except <br/>\n&gt; one. She gets it that she&#39;s not learning the same stuff at the same <br/>\ntime as <br/>\n&gt; every other kid and that she knows more about some things and they <br/>\nknow more <br/>\n&gt; other things. Also - I misunderstood about the mom grading the <br/>\nproblems, the <br/>\n&gt; kids graded each other - the mom gave them the answers to do it <br/>\nwith, I <br/>\n&gt; guess. Anyway, that wasn&#39;t really relevant - it didn&#39;t bother Rosie <br/>\nto have <br/>\n&gt; her papers graded, it was part of what they were playing - she was <br/>\nENJOYING <br/>\n&gt; it. No problem at all there.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My point was that if you&#39;re unschooling, you have to be aware that <br/>\nyour kids <br/>\n&gt; may get into these situations where they openly demonstrate that <br/>\nthey clearly <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know what other kids of their exact age are being taught and <br/>\nit could <br/>\n&gt; be embarrassing or upsetting - to the kid or to the parents. COULD <br/>\nbe!!! <br/>\n&gt; Wasn&#39;t at all in our case.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The point I was trying to make was unschoolers come to a problem <br/>\nlate, but <br/>\n&gt; with a maturity of thought that school schedule doesn&#39;t allow. When <br/>\nI said <br/>\n&gt; Rosie can think more clearly than the other girl - I was thinking <br/>\nabout the <br/>\n&gt; opportunity she has to think more clearly about the stuff before <br/>\nshe learns <br/>\n&gt; to &quot;do&quot; it. I didn&#39;t mean she just thinks more clearly, in general, <br/>\nabout <br/>\n&gt; anything and everything. Here is an example of what I was thinking <br/>\nabout <br/>\n&gt; (none too clearly, myself, given how very badly I expressed it):<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When my older daughter was about 6 or 7, she had a friend (Mary) <br/>\nwho had an <br/>\n&gt; older brother who was learning his &quot;multiplication facts&quot; in <br/>\nschool. He <br/>\n&gt; apparently practiced, out loud, so much that Mary memorized them <br/>\ntoo. Much <br/>\n&gt; was made over this by their teacher - a 1st grader knowing all her <br/>\n&gt; multiplication facts - very exciting.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A few years later, I was running a little &quot;math club&quot; for some 4th <br/>\ngraders <br/>\n&gt; and Mary was part of it. One day I heard one of the other girls <br/>\nexplaining to <br/>\n&gt; Mary that multiplication was really just a shortcut for doing <br/>\nrepeated <br/>\n&gt; addition. This was clearly a new concept to Mary -- she&#39;d learned <br/>\nto DO <br/>\n&gt; multiplication so young that she hadn&#39;t been able to really think <br/>\nclearly <br/>\n&gt; about it at that time and, since then, she&#39;d just done it without <br/>\ngiving it <br/>\n&gt; any thought and had, apparently, never realized that multiplication <br/>\nwas <br/>\n&gt; really not a whole &quot;new&quot; operation, but just another way to do <br/>\naddition. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Contrast that to how an unschooled child I know learned <br/>\nmultiplication. She <br/>\n&gt; added and added, she would add 8+8+8+8+8+8+8 for example, two <br/>\nnumbers at a <br/>\n&gt; time. One day she announced, &quot;Every time I want to add up seven <br/>\neights, it is <br/>\n&gt; always going to be 56 so I can just say that seven eights is fifty-<br/>\nsix and <br/>\n&gt; not have to do all that adding. Mom answered: &quot;Yep. And if you <br/>\nwant, you can <br/>\n&gt; just do the same thing for lots of numbers, like four fives or <br/>\nthree nines or <br/>\n&gt; whatever you want.&quot; &quot;WOW&quot; says the child - that is very cool. <br/>\nMom: &quot;I can <br/>\n&gt; show you how to make a table so you can do it for all the numbers <br/>\nfrom 1 to <br/>\n&gt; 10 or from 1 to 12 or whatever you want.&quot; So they did that and the <br/>\nchild <br/>\n&gt; memorized the multiplication facts because she was THRILLEd with <br/>\nthe concept <br/>\n&gt; of being able to do addition so quickly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now, this is a simple example, most people (but not all, by any <br/>\nmeans), come <br/>\n&gt; to realize that multiplication is really repeated addition, pretty <br/>\nquickly. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; However, take more difficult concepts and apply the same approach. <br/>\nHow many <br/>\n&gt; adults can quickly and easily explain why dividing one fraction by <br/>\nanother <br/>\n&gt; gives an answer that is BIGGER, not smaller. Why is 1/2 divided by <br/>\n1/4 equal <br/>\n&gt; to 2? Most adults will say because you get it by inverting and <br/>\nmultiplying so <br/>\n&gt; 1/2 divided by 1/4 becomes 1/2 times 4/1 which is 4/2 which is 2. <br/>\nBUT that is <br/>\n&gt; just a technique to DO it, not an explanation of the underlying <br/>\nconcept. What <br/>\n&gt; are you really doing when you divide one fraction by another? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you teach a child: &quot;To divide one fraction by another you invert <br/>\nand <br/>\n&gt; multiply,&quot; and make them practice doing it over and over, then that <br/>\nmay very <br/>\n&gt; likely be as clear as their thinking ever gets about that. But if <br/>\nyou wait <br/>\n&gt; until it comes up in some interesting relevant context where they <br/>\nreally need <br/>\n&gt; to or want to divide one fraction by another and take THAT <br/>\nopportunity to <br/>\n&gt; investigate and understand it - then the child will be able to <br/>\nthink about it <br/>\n&gt; more clearly. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The time that some kids spend doing worksheets will be time that <br/>\nunschooled <br/>\n&gt; kids spend doing other things. The other things are not likely to <br/>\nbe things <br/>\n&gt; that would show up in testing, for example, for kids that age. As I <br/>\nsaid, 5th <br/>\n&gt; graders are not getting tested on world geography, for example. <br/>\nThis is a <br/>\n&gt; choice people make - if they choose to do &quot;school&quot; curriculum <br/>\nstuff - either <br/>\n&gt; a little or a lot - then I support to the maximum their &quot;right&quot; to <br/>\ndo it and, <br/>\n&gt; heck, I&#39;ll even admit that could be the best choice for their <br/>\nfamily and <br/>\n&gt; maybe I&#39;m making a terrible mistake not doing it too. I&#39;m not <br/>\nomniscient and <br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t predict the future. However, IF someone is going to unschool -<br/>\n then <br/>\n&gt; their kids get to learn things on their own timetable and I really <br/>\nbelieve <br/>\n&gt; that one of the huge benefits is that, when they DO learn things, <br/>\nthey do it <br/>\n&gt; because of their own choice/interest and that is conducive to more <br/>\nclear <br/>\n&gt; thinking, more focus, more in-depth understanding, of what they are <br/>\nlearning.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I hope that makes more sense. Rosie&#39;s friend is a great kid and she <br/>\nand her <br/>\n&gt; family are great friends of ours and I certainly didn&#39;t mean to say <br/>\nthat she <br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t just wonderfully bright and intelligent.

I&#39;m just really glad that they&#39;re homeschooling <br/>\nand have <br/>\n&gt; found a way to do it that works well for them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My point was that radical unschoolers ought to be aware that they <br/>\nare <br/>\n&gt; &quot;trading off&quot; having their kids know stuff at certain ages at least <br/>\npartly <br/>\n&gt; because we think that they&#39;ll be able to &quot;get it&quot; better, if we let <br/>\nthem wait <br/>\n&gt; until they are ready and wanting to learn it (whatever it is). Of <br/>\ncourse, <br/>\n&gt; some of it they&#39;ll never get to - that&#39;s another reality. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I worry about parents who want to radically unschool and, at the <br/>\nSAME time, <br/>\n&gt; satisfy spouses or friends or relatives that their kids really are <br/>\nlearning <br/>\n&gt; just fine. It might not really seem &quot;just fine&quot; to them if the <br/>\nchild doesn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; learn long division until she&#39;s 13 instead of when it is taught in <br/>\nschools at <br/>\n&gt; about 9 years old.

Here is an example of what I was thinking about <br/>\n(none too clearly, myself, given how very badly I expressed it):<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my older daughter was about 6 or 7, she had a friend (Mary) who had an <br/>\nolder brother who was learning his &quot;multiplication facts&quot; in school. He <br/>\napparently practiced, out loud, so much that Mary memorized them too. Much <br/>\nwas made over this by their teacher - a 1st grader knowing all her <br/>\nmultiplication facts - very exciting.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few years later, I was running a little &quot;math club&quot; for some 4th graders <br/>\nand Mary was part of it. One day I heard one of the other girls explaining to <br/>\nMary that multiplication was really just a shortcut for doing repeated <br/>\naddition. This was clearly a new concept to Mary -- she&#39;d learned to DO <br/>\nmultiplication so young that she hadn&#39;t been able to really think clearly <br/>\nabout it at that time and, since then, she&#39;d just done it without giving it <br/>\nany thought and had, apparently, never realized that multiplication was <br/>\nreally not a whole &quot;new&quot; operation, but just another way to do addition. <br/>\n<br/>\nContrast that to how an unschooled child I know learned multiplication. She <br/>\nadded and added, she would add 8+8+8+8+8+8+8 for example, two numbers at a <br/>\ntime. One day she announced, &quot;Every time I want to add up seven eights, it is <br/>\nalways going to be 56 so I can just say that seven eights is fifty-six and <br/>\nnot have to do all that adding. Mom answered: &quot;Yep. And if you want, you can <br/>\njust do the same thing for lots of numbers, like four fives or three nines or <br/>\nwhatever you want.&quot; &quot;WOW&quot; says the child - that is very cool. Mom: &quot;I can <br/>\nshow you how to make a table so you can do it for all the numbers from 1 to <br/>\n10 or from 1 to 12 or whatever you want.&quot; So they did that and the child <br/>\nmemorized the multiplication facts because she was THRILLEd with the concept <br/>\nof being able to do addition so quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, this is a simple example, most people (but not all, by any means), come <br/>\nto realize that multiplication is really repeated addition, pretty quickly. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, take more difficult concepts and apply the same approach. How many <br/>\nadults can quickly and easily explain why dividing one fraction by another <br/>\ngives an answer that is BIGGER, not smaller. Why is 1/2 divided by 1/4 equal <br/>\nto 2? Most adults will say because you get it by inverting and multiplying so <br/>\n1/2 divided by 1/4 becomes 1/2 times 4/1 which is 4/2 which is 2. BUT that is <br/>\njust a technique to DO it, not an explanation of the underlying concept. What <br/>\nare you really doing when you divide one fraction by another? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you teach a child: &quot;To divide one fraction by another you invert and <br/>\nmultiply,&quot; and make them practice doing it over and over, then that may very <br/>\nlikely be as clear as their thinking ever gets about that. But if you wait <br/>\nuntil it comes up in some interesting relevant context where they really need <br/>\nto or want to divide one fraction by another and take THAT opportunity to <br/>\ninvestigate and understand it - then the child will be able to think about it <br/>\nmore clearly. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe time that some kids spend doing worksheets will be time that unschooled <br/>\nkids spend doing other things. The other things are not likely to be things <br/>\nthat would show up in testing, for example, for kids that age. As I said, 5th <br/>\ngraders are not getting tested on world geography, for example. This is a <br/>\nchoice people make - if they choose to do &quot;school&quot; curriculum stuff - either <br/>\na little or a lot - then I support to the maximum their &quot;right&quot; to do it and, <br/>\nheck, I&#39;ll even admit that could be the best choice for their family and <br/>\nmaybe I&#39;m making a terrible mistake not doing it too. I&#39;m not omniscient and <br/>\ncan&#39;t predict the future. However, IF someone is going to unschool - then <br/>\ntheir kids get to learn things on their own timetable and I really believe <br/>\nthat one of the huge benefits is that, when they DO learn things, they do it <br/>\nbecause of their own choice/interest and that is conducive to more clear <br/>\nthinking, more focus, more in-depth understanding, of what they are learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that makes more sense. Rosie&#39;s friend is a great kid and she and her <br/>\nfamily are great friends of ours and I certainly didn&#39;t mean to say that she <br/>\nisn&#39;t just wonderfully bright and intelligent. Her family is more of an <br/>\neclectic homeschooling family, not radical unschoolers like us, and they <br/>\nspend plenty of time following their children&#39;s interests and supporting <br/>\nthose interests.  I&#39;m just really glad that they&#39;re homeschooling and have <br/>\nfound a way to do it that works well for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point was that radical unschoolers ought to be aware that they are <br/>\n&quot;trading off&quot; having their kids know stuff at certain ages at least partly <br/>\nbecause we think that they&#39;ll be able to &quot;get it&quot; better, if we let them wait <br/>\nuntil they are ready and wanting to learn it (whatever it is). Of course, <br/>\nsome of it they&#39;ll never get to - that&#39;s another reality. <br/>\n<br/>\nI worry about parents who want to radically unschool and, at the SAME time, <br/>\nsatisfy spouses or friends or relatives that their kids really are learning <br/>\njust fine. It might not really seem &quot;just fine&quot; to them if the child doesn&#39;t <br/>\nlearn long division until she&#39;s 13 instead of when it is taught in schools at <br/>\nabout 9 years old. So - you sort of need to be clear in your own heads about <br/>\nwhether or not that kind of delay is okay with you and whether you feel <br/>\nconfident about the benefits of letting things &quot;wait&quot; like that. I sort of <br/>\nsee that as the purpose of this list, really, to help each other understand <br/>\nthe benefits of it, especially for people who get the &quot;disadvantages&quot; flung <br/>\nat them by concerned spouses and others. They need to know that there are <br/>\nreal reasons why some of us think that it is better to not teach something <br/>\njust because it is &quot;time&quot; according to schools.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pamS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5761,"nextTopicId":5757}}
