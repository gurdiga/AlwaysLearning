She would love<br/>\nto homeschool but both she and her husband<br/>\nMUST work.  They have asked us to watch the<br/>\nchild after Kindergarden.  We have said no,<br/>\nbecause it would interfer with Mark and the<br/>\ngirls going to park day, etc.  However, we<br/>\nsaid we would take her 2 days a week, on the<br/>\ndays that there are generally no activities<br/>\nwith homeschooling groups or with Mark&#39;s stay<br/>\nat home dad group.  It&#39;ll be good for both<br/>\ngirls to have a regular playmate.  And I feel<br/>\nbad for the child, who goes to this kids club<br/>\nafter school, which is basically glorified<br/>\nbaby sitting in a large very large group<br/>\nenvironment.  When I picked the child up the<br/>\nother day she was sitting with a bunch of<br/>\nother K-1st graders zoning at tv.   the<br/>\nemployees are all high school or college age<br/>\nstudents who get paid, I&#39;m sure, min wage. I<br/>\nwalked in, found Clarissa, walked across 4<br/>\nlarge rooms to where they store the<br/>\nbackpacks, got her back pack and then walked<br/>\nacross four rooms again to the exit.  No one<br/>\nonce asked me who I was or if I had the right<br/>\nto pick up this child.  Anyway... We&#39;ll take<br/>\nher 2 times a week, it&#39;ll be good for all the<br/>\nkids, and I&#39;ll pick her up each day on my way<br/>\nhome (it is right on my way home).  But<br/>\nanyway, I almost wanted to scream at the<br/>\nmom.  She said she can&#39;t afford a better<br/>\nafter school place for her child, because the<br/>\nreally good ones cost $400 or more a month,<br/>\nand this one is only $120 a month.
