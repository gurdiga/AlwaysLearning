Don&#39;t push  <br/>\nactivities that your child isn&#39;t interested in pursuing. Don&#39;t let  <br/>\nYOUR interests dictate your child&#39;s opportunities. If your child  <br/>\nwants a pet, be realistic and don&#39;t demand promises that the child  <br/>\nwill take sole care for it. Plant to care for it yourself when the  <br/>\ninterest wanes. Do it cheerfully. Model the joy of caring for  <br/>\nanimals. Model kindness and helpfulness. Help a child by organizing  <br/>\ntheir toys so they are easy to care for. Plan to care for them  <br/>\nyourself much of the time, but invite your child&#39;s help in ways that  <br/>\nare appealing. If YOU act like you hate organizing and cleaning, why  <br/>\nwould your child want to do it? Always openly enjoy the results of  <br/>\ncaring for your possessionsï¿½take note of the extra space to play in,  <br/>\nthe ease of finding things you want, how nice it is to reach into a  <br/>\ncupboard and find clean dishes. Enjoy housework together and don&#39;t  <br/>\nmake it a battle.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40698,"nextTopicId":40700}}
