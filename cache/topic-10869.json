That was moist. <br/>\nWe&#39;ve been swimming and playing piano and painting.<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been here and there doing this and that.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the here and there&#39;s, this and that&#39;s was the third annual &quot;Punkin<br/>\nChunkin&quot; in Missoula.<br/>\nOtherwise normal people get together to build air cannons and trebuchet&#39;s<br/>\nand such to fling pumpkins in a farmer&#39;s field.<br/>\nThis kind of thing speaks to my son.  <br/>\nWe went early so he could look at everything and talk to the folks who<br/>\nmade these strange contraptions.  One trebuchet was fashioned after the<br/>\nTrojan Rabbit from Monty Python.  Dylan liked that.<br/>\nWe stood around in the cold drinking coffee and hot chocolate watching<br/>\ntest firings and misfires and record pumpkin launches for five hours.  <br/>\nThe winning air cannon, Gourds in Space, with a sixty foot barrel, shot a<br/>\npumpkin over 3,100 feet.  No one ever told me what exactly one does with<br/>\na sixty foot air cannon for the other 364 days of the year, but maybe<br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t matter.  <br/>\nThe winner in the trebuchet&#39;s and others category was an &quot;other&quot;.  It was<br/>\na kind of big sling shot and fired a pumpkin four hundred and some feet. <br/>\n <br/>\nMaybe you have to be ten to appreciate this.   David and Dylan have been<br/>\nplanning and thinking about a trebuchet for a year now.  I suspect there<br/>\nis some pumpkin flinging in our future.   At least I hope it&#39;s only<br/>\npumpkins. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe went that same day Oct, 26, to a corn maze, spookified for Halloween. <br/>\n That was wonderful and scary and I did more screaming than anyone.   We<br/>\nfound a haunted house that night, too and were chased around buy creepy<br/>\nguys with chain saws, and little kids with silly string.    It was a good<br/>\nday.<br/>\n<br/>\nDylan is working on a comic strip to go into the magazine a girl on the<br/>\nlocal MT unschoolers list is making.   <br/>\nHe&#39;s having some trouble getting everything just right.   I&#39;ve been<br/>\nlistening to story lines all day as he tries to decide on the best one. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe asked if he could make up the menu for Thanksgiving and so far all I<br/>\nknow for sure is we&#39;re having corn chips and salsa.&lt;g&gt;   I hope our<br/>\nguests have a sense of humor.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re having friends over tomorrow to make paper.  We&#39;ve been collecting<br/>\nonion skins and scrap paper for awhile and need to do something with it. <br/>\n That should be sticky and messy and fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope everyone is having a good week.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11057,"nextTopicId":11066}}
