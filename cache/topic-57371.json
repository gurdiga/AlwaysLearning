Two days ago Marty and his girlfriend and I were talking about  <br/>\nthe index, though I couldn&#39;t remember the name of it (consumer price  <br/>\nindex), and how it compares the price of a loaf of bread to mininum  <br/>\nwage and such.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty has asked me about what the motivation of a young, black,  <br/>\nsouthern man might be to join the army during WWII.  He&#39;s involved in  <br/>\na role playing game involving an alternative history about different  <br/>\nnations having different gods, and his character has been assigned as  <br/>\na soldier in the 1940&#39;s.  We talked about the G.I. Bill and upward  <br/>\nmobility, and the general feeling of patriotism and fear in the U.S.  <br/>\nin those days, and that the army had options (probably still does) for  <br/>\nenlistees to send some or all of their paycheck to their mother or wife.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was just a day or two after someone had asked on this list about  <br/>\nkids&#39; interests in military history.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talked about early-&#39;50s tract houses, built in part, it seems, to  <br/>\nsatisfy the promises made to veterans that they could get a loan to  <br/>\nbuy a home.  We lived in a 1952 tract house when my kids were little-- <br/>\none that my husband&#39;s parents bought in the late 50&#39;s.  His dad had  <br/>\nbeen a recon pilot in the Pacific.
