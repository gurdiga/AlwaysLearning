On day 3, my DD figured out that maybe this wasn&#39;t what she wanted to do, she went into the classroom on her own, but I could tell she wasn&#39;t happy.  By day 5, I was calling the school saying she would not be in class. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe missed all of last week (days 6 through 10), and I will be pulling her out of school on Monday.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo many friends, acquaintances, and people I don&#39;t know at all have asked the same question:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What doesn&#39;t she like about kindergarten?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday, I wrote down a few short answers (based on my perspective), there are more, but I read them to my daughter to verify, and she nodded her head to every single one.<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  Getting up early. (She is accustomed to falling asleep when tired, and waking when ready to get up.)<br/>\n2)  Trying to figure out what to wear in the very short period of time between being awake (fully) and needing to be at school.<br/>\n3)  Being hurried.<br/>\n4)  Leaving home.<br/>\n5)  Saying good-bye to Mommy and Daddy.<br/>\n6)  Saying good-bye to her sister.<br/>\n7)  Not being able to play with her sister.<br/>\n8)  Not being able to eat when she is hungry, and having to eat on the school schedule.<br/>\n9)  Being at school from 8:10 to 3:20.<br/>\n10) Firedrills.<br/>\n11) The lunch room noise and craziness.<br/>\n12) Not being with her dog all day.<br/>\n13) Having to ask to go to the bathroom.<br/>\n14) Being shuffled from here to there without any say in the matter.<br/>\n15) Having to do it all again the next day.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot one of these answers will suit someone who wants their kid in school. Not one of these answers is acceptable to the school staff who is supposed to &quot;help&quot; me keep her in school. Not one of these answers is acceptable to any one of my friends, non-friends, or acquaintances who feel like school is their first and only choice.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, for us, each and every one of these answers is more than enough reason to not continue with school.<br/>\n<br/>\nRelief is definitely what I feel when I know that we will be done with Kindergarten on Monday.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Feeling Mentally Exhausted By Too Many Questions","postDate":"1314492653","msgId":62531,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgwNkQ3Qjc1LTZBRUUtNERFNS1CREU1LTY5RUI0OUI3QzdENUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGozYzJjditiYjRmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGozYzJjditiYjRmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":62530,"nextInTopic":62532,"prevInTime":62530,"nextInTime":62532,"topicId":62512,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Maybe she read it and thought that when I get to stage three and she tells me that her kid had his snack withheld for punishment at school I ll just nod my","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-60079697\">-=-Maybe she read it and thought that when I get to stage three and she tells me that her kid had his snack withheld for punishment at school I&#39;ll just nod my head and smile.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess she can hope.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what if, right now, if she tells you that her kid has his snack withheld you just nod?
