Look in the corners of your frustration.  Is  <br/>\nit that you want them to pay attention to you?  Or that you want to  <br/>\nfeel like a great unschooler?  (a worthy desire) or do you miss going  <br/>\nout of the house?  Or do you miss other people?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could invite others over, to play Wii, or to have lunch, or to  <br/>\nwatch a movie with you (if the Wii isn&#39;t on the only good movie-TV).<br/>\nYou could take one child out with you while another stays home and  <br/>\nplays Wii, if there&#39;s another adult to be home.<br/>\nYou could spend the frustrated feelings thinking of other things to do  <br/>\nsomeday when the Wii isn&#39;t so new.<br/>\nYou could practice breathing and being mindful.  My sister just told  <br/>\nme excitedly that she&#39;s only having to pay $35 a week for her  <br/>\ncounsellor and she really likes him and he&#39;s having her think about  <br/>\nmindfulness, about her feelings and emotions, and about waiting before  <br/>\nshe responds.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere, free.

Today I suggested skating and got a positive response....until it was time to leave and then was met with I dont want to go.  Our wii has been on from the moment they wake up til the moment they go to sleep these days and I tried explaining that it would still be here when they got back...<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course we didnt go....but I still felt disappointed and frustrated.
