I am a compulsive apologizer and always have been.  My friends will even tell me to stop apologizing for stuff (well, the good friends - there are some that are used to blaming me because I automatically take the blame....maybe they aren&#39;t such good friends???)  Anyway, I have been working on this and questioning myself as to why I feel the need --- to make ME feel better?  To make the other person feel better?  To remain liked by the other?  Haven&#39;t figured it out yet.  As you can imagine, since I feel this huge need I have totally put this on my kids and have required apologies, probably even when none were necessary -- I will be thinking more carefully about this.  I know they (my kids) have felt put out and/or embarrassed by this at times.  I am so glad this topic is being discussed because JUST TONIGHT something came up that I wanted my daughter (16 years old) to apologize to a friend for but I didn&#39;t ask her to because I wanted<br/>\n to get your guys&#39; opinion real quick first.  Last weekend we had a 16th birthday party for my daughter and she handled the guest list and all the invites (I usually really control this part because I don&#39;t want anyone left out or feeling bad - to the point where people have been invited in the past that have hindered the party atmosphere)...she handed out little flyers and texted and sent Myspace messages to those she thought about and wanted to come.  The party was really fun and everyone had a great time.  Well, tonight some good friends came over with their daughter and I realized that we completely forgot about inviting her to the party.  I was feeling horrible because they all run in a big circle of friends and I&#39;m sure this girl had heard about the party.  So I asked my daughter before the friends came over if she remembered to invite this particular girl and she said she didn&#39;t remember if she did or not and we both felt bad.  My daughter has not apologized to this<br/>\n girl and I&#39;m not sure if she should or should I encourage my daughter to say something to this girl?  The evening felt  awkard or it could&#39;ve just been me perceiving it.

How do you know her?? :)    In all seriousness, my child is now 13, but you described her to a T when she was 5.  We didn&#39;t do everything perfectly and there were times I was COMPLETELY frustrated.  Our whole family is SUPER flexible and this poor child was plopped right in the middle!  Here are some things I&#39;ve learned from her:<br/>\n   <br/>\n  * she is our barometer - she detects certain atmospheres and stresses that the rest of us miss until it&#39;s too late - then we are all stressed out - I&#39;ve learned to watch her more closely because when she gets inflexible, it&#39;s usually a pre-cursor to anxiety so I need to change something (go home if out, slow down our life, etc.)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  * that she might lose some friends through her inflexibility and that is a fact of life - not everyone is going to want to put up with it and invite her over; also that there were (are) some combination of friends that she could not blend with for very long.  I learned to make playdates with people who had kids that really liked my daughter and were pretty flexible themselves - so there weren&#39;t too many bosses!  :)  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  * her inflexibility is going to help her stand by her beliefs keep her dedicated to what she puts her mind to and fulfill her dreams<br/>\n   <br/>\n  * as she gets older, and matures emotionally, she is able to flex a lot more!  Now that she&#39;s a teen, she cares what others think of her and it has helped her to think outside of herself sometimes - it helps her get along with others.  However, there are some of her friends that have similar inflexible, bossy personalities and I limit how much time she spends with those friends just because it&#39;s too draining on her and taxing on the friendships.  These are great people-skills to learn because even as an adult I realize that there are people that I need to limit my time with, but don&#39;t want to completely ditch the relationship....I wish I had learned that at her age (it would&#39;ve kept me out of a lot of trouble!!).   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Don&#39;t worry, as she grows so will her emotions and abilities.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Take care,<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa Meuser &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:llmeuser@...\">llmeuser@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  This is a bit long. Going to start w/ two examples of the inflexible <br/>\npattern Kathrynn has going on, and then talk about it a bit. Would <br/>\nappreciate feedback and suggestions. J<br/>\n<br/>\nKathrynn (5) is playing w/ kids, they are going to play a knight and <br/>\ndragon kinda game. She is dressed as a knight. One of her friends is <br/>\ndressed as a dragon, but doesnt want to put the wings on. K is upset <br/>\nbc her friend does not want to be a flying dragon, and thinks she HAS <br/>\nto be a flying dragon for the game. We try to problem solve, <br/>\nempathyze, but in the end K is very mad and angry, upset and yelling, <br/>\nbc the other child will not put the wings on to make her a flying <br/>\ndragon. K tells me to make the other child put on the wings, or take <br/>\nthe costume off the other girl so that I can be a flying dragon. I <br/>\noffer to be a flying dragon w/ just the wings. K continues to sob and <br/>\nyell at me to take the costome from the girl, or force her to wear <br/>\nthe wings. Luckily, the other kids decide to eat some lunch, then the <br/>\nother girl decides to take off the costume, possibly bc she is tired <br/>\nof hearing K in the other room sob about it and say mean things.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater, they are playing knights again. Another boy also wants to be a <br/>\nknight. We differentiate and make them two different kinds of <br/>\nknights. K insists that she is the only Knight. No one else is ok <br/>\nwith her idea. She will not yield, and is sobbing and being mean. <br/>\nI suggest we go outside and look for signs of Spring. This wokrs. <br/>\nIssue remains.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater, they are on my friends bed. Half are playing mud fight (pillow <br/>\nfight) and K wants to lay on the bed w/o kids jumping on it. I <br/>\nsuggest that K can move to another bed. She refuses. She tells <br/>\neveryone they have to get off the bed. Other kids are not ok with <br/>\nthat. I remind her that weve talked about if she needs some alone <br/>\ntime, she can find a space to her self, but asking everyone else to <br/>\nleave a space so that she can have alone time may not work. Somehow <br/>\nthat situation gets resolved.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the end of the day, it is more and more apparent that the kids are <br/>\ngetting tired of kathrynns grumpy responses. They dont understand <br/>\nit, and they are starting to feel a bit uncomfortable about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have talked w/ K about flexibility, A LOT. About how being <br/>\ninflexible ultimately affects her and her friends. I have <br/>\nbrainstormed alternatives, solutions, empathized, held the space, <br/>\nused shere patience of waiting. I feel we are stuck in something, and <br/>\nI am mostly thinking it is bc she is going through a major <br/>\ndevelopmental stage.<br/>\nIn the mean time, do I keep her home? She is extremely social and <br/>\nloves to be with her friends. And yet is having a hard time working <br/>\nwith the flow of being w/ her friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know the pattern for her- she sets up a vision of what she wants. <br/>\nShe has always been this way.She sees a game (or something) happening <br/>\nin one way. And then she expects and demands that it go that way. <br/>\nWhen it does not, she ultimately feels disempowered, to a certain <br/>\nextent. And it can spiral from there. She ebbs and flows in how she <br/>\nmanages this pattern. Sometimes she is able to be more flexible and <br/>\nfluid. But lately it is just painful for me to be a part of- I see my <br/>\nfriend cringe. I see the other kids cringe. I see kathrynn feeling <br/>\npain and frustration and anger.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

That is the question that I&#39;ve <br/>\nasked myself.  And why should it be any different because my children are young.  In <br/>\npractice, this doesn&#39;t mean that I have an expectation that they will run around <br/>\napologizing for everything that is a perceived wrong, or even an expectation in any <br/>\nparticular moment, but I have an overall expectation that my kids will grow into the kind <br/>\nof people that can learn from their mistakes, own up to them when appropriate and <br/>\ngraciously forgive others, when appropriate.  (I really liked your phrase &quot;graciously <br/>\nforgiving.&quot;)  I know plenty of adults who can&#39;t do this.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike so many other words in our language, the word apology has a lot of baggage <br/>\nattatched to it.  Everyone has that image of the forced apology--ugly.  That is not at all <br/>\nwhat I&#39;m talking about.  I&#39;m talking about a place where feelings have been worked <br/>\nthrough and my child is in a place of desiring reconciliation.  An apology can facilitate a <br/>\nreconciliation.  There&#39;s no forcing--when given, it comes from their heart.  And if my child <br/>\nhas done something wrong to someone, they always want reconciliation.  So what I&#39;m really <br/>\ntalking about is my children going from being tied-up-in-knots back to a place where <br/>\ntheir emotional energy is flowing again, and wanting to take that flow back into the <br/>\nrelationship.  It&#39;s always a choice to remain blocked--but I&#39;m helping my kids find ways to <br/>\nunblock.  The result in my husband&#39;s family of the inability to unblock is that my MIL <br/>\nhasn&#39;t spoken to her brother in 45 years, over something pretty minor.  I don&#39;t want to see <br/>\nthat pattern continued.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery time something happens and my kids reach that place, make an apology and find <br/>\nacceptance of themselves and from the other person (even better) they realize that their <br/>\nmistakes are o.k. and fixable and have more trust in themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna<br/>\n<br/>\n.--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Pam Tellew &lt;pamtellew@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;I worked out the apology thing a long time ago, because there is <br/>\n&gt; some conventional<br/>\n&gt; (wisdom) that says not to &quot;make&quot; kids apologize.

This part can look like many <br/>\ndifferent things--silently sitting beside them, holding them, leaving them alone until they <br/>\nfeel ready, talking them down.  The amends part comes in much later, and is a natural <br/>\nextension of their healing and wanting to rejoin their society.  The guilt is transformed into <br/>\nunderstanding and reconnection, and their hearts open back up.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter was just involved in a situation in which she became embarrassed about her <br/>\nnew feelings for a boy with her friends.  She brought the subject up, but then became <br/>\ncertain that a friend had told her secret to another friend and got really angry.  It was <br/>\nimmediately apparent to all concerned that that hadn&#39;t happened, but she got locked into <br/>\nher tangle of emotions and froze up.  She didn&#39;t know what to do, so she continued to say <br/>\nshe was mad and wouldn&#39;t talk to the friend.  It was an ongoing drama at the park all that <br/>\nday.  She wouldn&#39;t talk to me or anyone else--was just miserable and angry.  The friend <br/>\nthen started to get angry back and things began to get ugly.  We all ended up at a mutual <br/>\nfriend&#39;s house as we had already planned a sleepover (visiting another city), so the drama <br/>\nwas continuing with feelings mounting.  When I was finally able to converse with my dd, I <br/>\nguessed how she was feeling.  Yep, she was hugely embarrassed at the drama she&#39;d <br/>\ncaused and didn&#39;t know how to get out of it.  One simple conversation later, with me <br/>\nexplaining to her friend, her standing there, and all was resolved and the four girls <br/>\ninvolved all got along beautifully the rest of the night.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few days later we ended up in a similar situation with her friend being the one who got <br/>\nstuck and didn&#39;t know how to get out of it.

That confused me, because what should <br/>\nhappen when someone has &quot;wronged&quot; another?  I think that wisdom is around to avoid the <br/>\nugliness of a forced apology, but it has taken over and confused parents about what a <br/>\nheartfelt acceptance of responsibility and a healing acceptance of apology can look like.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s what it looks like for us:  I will talk with the hurt child first and make sure they are <br/>\no.k.--even better when there&#39;s another parent there do comfort the hurt one.  Then I <br/>\nfocus on the one who did the hurting, empathize, let them tell their story, and then as <br/>\nthings cool down and they feel understood I will begin to interject the voice of the other <br/>\nside.  At some point here the &quot;offender&quot; will begin to feel sorry that the situation got out of <br/>\ncontrol, and I will ask if they are ready to apologize--and at this point it is sincere and <br/>\ntotally coming from them.  I just facilitate the communication.  If they are too embarrassed <br/>\nto speak, which is happening lately with my daughter, then we both go and I do the <br/>\nspeaking.  And the connection that happens frequently makes the relationship better than <br/>\nbefore.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry if this is obvious to many of you--but it wasn&#39;t to me when my children were <br/>\nlittler and I had some friends that felt strongly that their kids &quot;shouldn&#39;t&quot; apologize, which <br/>\nis what is has become in some circles.  I was very confused because I could feel the <br/>\nunfinished business hanging in the air, between both children, and often the problem <br/>\nwould then come up over and over because it hadn&#39;t been really resolved.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":307938888,"authorName":"Amanda Horein","from":"&quot;Amanda Horein&quot; &lt;horein@...&gt;","profile":"michmdmama","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Inflexibility","postDate":"1206028354","msgId":33345,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIzMzJkZjUwMDgwMzIwMDg1Mmo2ODc0Y2UzNm1mOWY5NTk5ZTc2YzA3ZjgwQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":33344,"nextInTopic":33349,"prevInTime":33344,"nextInTime":33346,"topicId":33341,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Lisa, I have no suggestions.

Going to start w/ two examples of the inflexible  <br/>\npattern Kathrynn has going on, and then talk about it a bit. Would  <br/>\nappreciate feedback and suggestions. J<br/>\n<br/>\nKathrynn (5) is playing w/ kids, they are going to play a knight and  <br/>\ndragon kinda game. She is dressed as a knight. One of her friends is  <br/>\ndressed as a dragon, but doesn’t want to put the wings on. K is upset  <br/>\nbc her friend does not want to be a flying dragon, and thinks she HAS  <br/>\nto be a flying dragon for the game. We try to problem solve,  <br/>\nempathyze, but in the end K is very mad and angry, upset and yelling,  <br/>\nbc the other child will not put the wings on to make her a flying  <br/>\ndragon. K tells me to make the other child put on the wings, or take  <br/>\nthe costume off the other girl so that I can be a flying dragon. I  <br/>\noffer to be a flying dragon w/ just the wings. K continues to sob and  <br/>\nyell at me to take the costome from the girl, or force her to wear  <br/>\nthe wings. Luckily, the other kids decide to eat some lunch, then the  <br/>\nother girl decides to take off the costume, possibly bc she is tired  <br/>\nof hearing K in the other room sob about it and say “mean” things.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater, they are playing knights again. Another boy also wants to be a  <br/>\nknight. We differentiate and make them two different kinds of  <br/>\nknights. K insists that she is the only Knight. No one else is ok  <br/>\nwith her idea. She will not yield, and is sobbing and being “mean”.   <br/>\nI suggest we go outside and look for signs of Spring. This wokrs.  <br/>\nIssue remains.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater, they are on my friends bed. Half are playing mud fight (pillow  <br/>\nfight) and K wants to lay on the bed w/o kids jumping on it. I  <br/>\nsuggest that K can move to another bed. She refuses. She tells  <br/>\neveryone they have to get off the bed. Other kids are not ok with  <br/>\nthat. I remind her that we’ve talked about if she needs some alone  <br/>\ntime, she can find a space to her self, but asking everyone else to  <br/>\nleave a space so that she can have alone time may not work.  Somehow  <br/>\nthat situation gets resolved.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the end of the day, it is more and more apparent that the kids are  <br/>\ngetting tired of kathrynn’s grumpy responses. They don’t understand  <br/>\nit, and they are starting to feel a bit uncomfortable about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have talked w/ K about flexibility,  A LOT.

And then she expects and demands that it go that way.   <br/>\nWhen it does not, she ultimately feels disempowered, to a certain  <br/>\nextent. And it can spiral from there. She ebbs and flows in how she  <br/>\nmanages this pattern. Sometimes she is able to be more flexible and  <br/>\nfluid. But lately it is just painful for me to be a part of- I see my  <br/>\nfriend cringe. I see the other kids cringe.
