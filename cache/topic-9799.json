What a fun<br/>\nfamily.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur neighbor doesn&#39;t let her kids play in the rain.  Dylan loves the<br/>\nrain, in the summer when it&#39;s warm, and is always out in it.  She came<br/>\nover a few weeks ago with her littlest boy and told me... came over TO<br/>\ntell me, that HER kids don&#39;t play in the rain because they could get sick<br/>\nand she didn&#39;t think it was fair that Dylan was out there, right across<br/>\nthe street, where her kids could see, playing in the rain.  I said, no<br/>\nthat&#39;s not fair that they can&#39;t play in the rain too, and I was amazed<br/>\nabout the illness because he&#39;s ten now and has never gotten sick from it.<br/>\n She looked at her little boy and said, sternly, &quot;GO HOME&quot;  and then told<br/>\nme she didn&#39;t appreciate me saying stuff like that in front of her<br/>\nkids...   She didn&#39;t seem to think it was a problem that she was in my<br/>\nyard, in front of my kid telling me WE shouldn&#39;t be outside because HER<br/>\nkids weren&#39;t allowed in the rain.... well, whatever.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYour mud story made me happy.  = )  You want to come and be my neighbor?<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":108691200,"authorName":"Kimber","from":"&quot;Kimber&quot; &lt;snibbor@...&gt;","profile":"twoangels_jj","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Our Rainy Day","postDate":"1034262103","msgId":9799,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNGIwMWMyNzA2ZCRmMmQ2YmEyMCQyZGJkZmVhOUBkZWZhdWx0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":9801,"prevInTime":9798,"nextInTime":9800,"topicId":9799,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Okay, Deb.

You&#39;ve inspired me to share our day yesterday.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe awoke to the sound of rainfall outside.  A slow, steady, relaxing rain that makes you want to lounge in bed all day.  My daughter was snuggled up beside me and smiling sweetly from her dreams.<br/>\n<br/>\nMady (6) somehow talked her brother Alex (9) into painting her toenails (because he does such a gooooood job) for her.  It was the cutest thing I had seen in a while........he was kneeling in the floor painting toes, while she sat in the chair looking like a pampered princess.  I did find out later that it was actually a business proposition that got Alex interested.  He was charging her 25 cents per toe/finger and he easily told me that she would be giving him $5 of her allowance on payday.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nA while later, I found the kids sitting under the patio cover listening to the rain fall onto it.  I could see the excitement in their eyes as they asked me, &quot;Hey Mom, can we go play in the mud?&quot;   Now, I am sort of a perfectionist and I don&#39;t like things dirty.  I usually don&#39;t intentionally let them get covered head to toe in mud, but I decided it is surely to be a learning experience, right?  (we&#39;ve been completely unschooling for 4-5 months now and I am still doing my best to deschool myself!)  Needless to say, they had a blast.  After the gigantic mud pie construction, they discovered how fun it was to rub the mud all over each other which of course, had to be removed by spraying each other with the water hose.     After their subsequent showers, wrapped in their fuzziest robes, they had steaming hot chocolate for afternoon snack.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t long before something else fun was started.  Alex got his Hot Wheels out and they had crash up derby in the kitchen floor.   They used all the blocks, Legos, and Lincoln Logs to build towers to crash into.  While Alex was building, Mady got tired of waiting and got out a math workbook and did a couple of pages.  She had to have me check for accuracy as soon as she was finished (which of course my baby did wonderfully!) and then hang it on the fridge for all to see.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen the fort building started.  I truly guess I have lost the battle for the living room.  We don&#39;t have a playroom so the kids have taken over my tastefully decorated living area.  They had forts built from one end of the room to the other.  Alex got out his video camera and started filming a sequel to &quot;War of Wars&quot; which he filmed last week for his Mimi.  For his birthday last year, she got him almost every GI Joe doll and accessory available.  She is in the Army Reserve and very military oriented.  He filmed his dolls (excuse me, It was requested I use the term, soldiers........) ahem, ....soldiers in the midst of a ferocious battle.  It was kinda Toy Storyish.  Anyway, they were now doing a sequel with Barbie and her friends with the Soldiers.  Barbie&#39;s house was eventually bombed (you could &#39;hear&#39; the fighter pilots coming) but everyone made it out okay.  Whew!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a wonderful day for us all!  I even had time to do some reading myself.   We now have to plan Daddy&#39;s birthday party ....it&#39;s tonight....and people are coming over.......eeek!  I guess the forts will have to be put away for another rainy day.  <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKimber<br/>\nMomma to Alex (ds9) and Madalyn (dd6)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9850,"nextTopicId":9856}}
