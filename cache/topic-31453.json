My daughter <br/>\nasked me if I thought she should learn them, and if I knew them all. I told <br/>\nher that I was pretty sure that I still knew all the capitals, but that it <br/>\nhasn&#39;t turned out to be a particularly useful thing for me to know except for <br/>\nhelping to win certain games. She decided she wanted to survey a lot of adults to <br/>\nfind out if they&#39;d ever learned the capitals, if they still knew them, and if <br/>\nthey had found it important or useful to know them. She asked everyone we ran <br/>\ninto for a week, and I also posted the questions on the AOL homeschooling <br/>\nboards, which at the time were quite a busy place. It sparked a lot of interesting <br/>\ndiscussion, online and off. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************************<br/>\n See what&#39;s new at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":327905838,"authorName":"hollywoodapi","from":"&quot;hollywoodapi&quot; &lt;anna@...&gt;","profile":"hollywoodapi","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"The Bitter Homeschooler","postDate":"1194922833","msgId":31453,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZoYjQwaCs3dmUxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":31456,"prevInTime":31452,"nextInTime":31454,"topicId":31453,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Although this list is not directly related to unschoolers, I thought it was cute nonetheless. http://www.secular-homeschooling.com/001/bitter_homeschooler.html","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1618861388\">Although this list is not directly related to unschoolers, I thought <br/>\nit was cute nonetheless.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.secular-homeschooling.com/001/bitter_homeschooler.html\">http://www.secular-homeschooling.com/001/bitter_homeschooler.html</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd somebody recommended to add the following items to the list in <br/>\nhonor of unschoolers...<br/>\n <br/>\n#26.
