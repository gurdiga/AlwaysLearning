I haven&#39;t told her about unschooling per se, although she seems to have learned the word, somewhere, and knows it&#39;s the kind of homeschooling we do. I have mentioned that some people who have gone to school think the best or only place kids can learn is in school. Some acquaintances of hers were asking about homeschooling - what do you do? How do you Learn anything? so she wanted to know what was wrong with those kids, that they didn&#39;t know how to learn. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] talking about unschooling with your children","postDate":"1333147057","msgId":66496,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERCQkM5MEEzLTY1RkMtNDE0RS05MjNBLTFCNkQ4NzBFNjNGQUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBRUhuYmVaWVc5ZUctT2NZVWdHZGkwZy1jZHZlLV9EcXlUSE1BR1FBbzBpa0VqZUpfZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBRUhuYmVaWVc5ZUctT2NZVWdHZGkwZy1jZHZlLV9EcXlUSE1BR1FBbzBpa0VqZUpfZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":66494,"nextInTopic":66497,"prevInTime":66495,"nextInTime":66497,"topicId":66494,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I ve received their view: Im not sure!

If they wonder, they&#39;ll ask you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSelf-consciousness about how they&#39;re learning isn&#39;t a great addition to their toolbox.  I&#39;ve seen unschooling parents who yap on about unschooling being great, and we do X because we&#39;re unschoolers, and every time, I&#39;ve wished they hadn&#39;t done that.   At a conference, during a discussion, that&#39;s a time to discuss it.  At home on a normal day in the real world? I wouldn&#39;t unless they ask.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":351282822,"authorName":"Hope Nilges","from":"Hope Nilges &lt;h_nilges@...&gt;","profile":"h_nilges","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] talking about unschooling with your children","postDate":"1333142352","msgId":66497,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMzMxNDIzNTIuNzIzNzIuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE2MTgwMS5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PENBRUhuYmVaWVc5ZUctT2NZVWdHZGkwZy1jZHZlLV9EcXlUSE1BR1FBbzBpa0VqZUpfZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBRUhuYmVaWVc5ZUctT2NZVWdHZGkwZy1jZHZlLV9EcXlUSE1BR1FBbzBpa0VqZUpfZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":66496,"nextInTopic":66498,"prevInTime":66496,"nextInTime":66498,"topicId":66494,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"=Im wondering how others share what unschooling is with their children.= I kept a blog when we first began unschooling which detailed my untangling of thoughts","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1856151495\">=Im wondering how others share what unschooling is with their children.=<br/>\n<br/>\nI kept a blog when we first began unschooling which detailed my untangling of thoughts and ideas, observations about the kids learning, dealing with my own doubts, pictures of our days, etc. Both of the kids had access to the blog. My then 9yo son was really interested and asked lots of questions about unschooling which I answered. My then 8yo daughter could have cared less- she was just living her life and reading about it sure seemed boring. So, I put the information out there and then followed their lead about how much each of them wanted to know.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":286713246,"authorName":"Melissa Dietrick","from":"Melissa Dietrick &lt;melissa.dietrick@...&gt;","profile":"melidi7","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"talking about unschooling with your children","postDate":"1333141182","msgId":66494,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBRUhuYmVaWVc5ZUctT2NZVWdHZGkwZy1jZHZlLV9EcXlUSE1BR1FBbzBpa0VqZUpfZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":66496,"prevInTime":66493,"nextInTime":66495,"topicId":66494,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"hello, Im wondering how others share what unschooling is with their children. my last 3 that we are unschooling with are 11yo, 8yo and 6yo, my olders have all","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2007593698\">hello,<br/>\nIm wondering how others share what unschooling is with their children.<br/>\nmy last 3 that we are unschooling with are 11yo, 8yo and 6yo,<br/>\nmy olders have all gone to school but have been living with<br/>\nunschooling principals for 5 years now...Deschooling is still happening for<br/>\nme and my husband...<br/>\nIm not sure how to explain the why for my question.<br/>\nI have noticed in interviews and descriptions that the children express<br/>\nthemselves as &quot;learning on their own&quot; &quot;learning all the time&quot; and I am<br/>\nwondering how my children would answer that question from someone (school<br/>\nofficials come to mind, with exam time looming in the near future).
