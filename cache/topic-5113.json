She gave birth to her first<br/>\ndaughter, alone, in a tar paper/wood shack in the mountains of West<br/>\nVirginia - a pump inside for running water and an outhouse - the wind would<br/>\nwhistle in between the slats of wood.  Her husband had gone for help and<br/>\nJoe&#39;s aunt was born before anyone got there.  She bore five children at home<br/>\nand three in the hospital.  Her husband was in WW2 and was MIA for almost 2<br/>\nyears.  This woman can can, cook, bake, make clothes, chop wood - you name<br/>\nit.  By no means does she pine for the good old days.  She likes being able<br/>\nto buy meat without killing and cleaning the animal, she likes soap from the<br/>\nstore, she makes handmade goods still because that is what she can afford<br/>\nand it is important to her to continue to be independent.  She cans and<br/>\nfreezes her veggies cause it costs too dern much to drive over the mountain<br/>\nand pay big store prices(she still lives on the mountain).  Grandma was a<br/>\nwidow at 31, she has buried parents, children, a husband, and grandchildren.<br/>\nWhen she makes a statement such as you don&#39;t know how good you have it - she<br/>\nis not intending to be condescending, it is the truth.  Personally, I think<br/>\nwe should all (including children) be reminded of how good we have it, a<br/>\nreality check of sorts.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoe has some stories too, some of his childhood and others from being in the<br/>\nmilitary for 12 years - most he cares not to share.<br/>\n<br/>\nsistakammi</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":685668,"authorName":"Wings2Fly@aol.com","from":"Wings2Fly@...","profile":"ladyvirginiaruth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Temperment Matters","postDate":"1014664675","msgId":5179,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4Ny4zZTQxZGY0LjI5YWJlN2UzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5178,"nextInTopic":5180,"prevInTime":5178,"nextInTime":5180,"topicId":5113,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/25/02 2:17:10 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...

But high schools <br/>\nroutinely start as early as 7:00 a.m.  Why?  These kids need sleep and <br/>\nwithout it they suffer from depression, agitation, loss of focus, all kinds <br/>\nof stuff.  So instead of moving back the time school starts for teens, they <br/>\nlabel them, medicate them, and stigmatize them.  <br/>\n<br/>\n~Ginny<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":84135975,"authorName":"homeschoolmd","from":"&quot;homeschoolmd&quot; &lt;homeschoolmd@...&gt;","profile":"homeschoolmd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Temperment Matters","postDate":"1014662918","msgId":5176,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGE1ZTB1NitiODZqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNC45ZjViM2MwLjI5YWJkMGQyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5175,"nextInTopic":5177,"prevInTime":5175,"nextInTime":5177,"topicId":5113,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Everyone has made many good points about the improvements that have been made over the years and I *am* very thankful for the life I have with my family.

The confining iron lung would have been replaced by a simple <br/>\nplastic tube connected to a small portable ventilator.  Physical therapy <br/>\ntechniques could have prevented the contraction of muscles....<br/>\n<br/>\nEven as polio became only a bad memory, other health threats haunted <br/>\nAmericans.  Measles, mumps and scarlet fever were scourges of childhood.  <br/>\nNinety percent of all children prior to the mid-1960&#39;s &quot;caught the measles.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTuberculosis was also very common.  (My mil spent a couple of *years* in a <br/>\nsanitarium, separated form her parents and her family, when she was only four <br/>\nyears old because she had TB.  The family did not own a car, so her parents <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t even visit her frequently.  At her age, pre-reading, letters had to <br/>\nbe simple, phone calls were long distance and very expensive, it was <br/>\nundoubtedly traumatic. ) <br/>\n<br/>\nToday&#39;s government programs ensure that most if not all children have access <br/>\nto medical care.  In 1965, 20% of children whose family income was below the <br/>\npoverty level had never been examined by a doctor.  By 1970, that number had <br/>\ndropped to 8%.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the 1940&#39;s and 50&#39;s, factory smokestacks (I remember the black, thick <br/>\nsmoke emanating from these) and auto emissions polluted the air.  Since the <br/>\nenvironmental laws passed in the 70&#39;s smog in the US has been reduced by 1/3 <br/>\nand invisible pollutants (such as acid rain) have been cut nearly 50%.  <br/>\nRivers were polluted.  Fishing on Lake Erie was banned and dumped factory <br/>\nwaste in Ohio caused the Cuyahoga River to catch fire.  Today, twice as many <br/>\nlakes and streams are safe for fishing and swimming as were in 1970.<br/>\n<br/>\nHomes are less toxic today.  Asbestos and/or formaldehyde used to be found in <br/>\ninsulation.  Radon gas fro decaying radium in the soil beneath basements can <br/>\nbe cancerous.  Gardens were sprayed with DDT -- a powder originally used to <br/>\ndisinfect soldiers of body lice. Trucks and airplanes sprayed clouds of DDT <br/>\nover fields and homes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBetween 1942 and 1953, Love canal in Niagra Falls NY was legally used as a <br/>\ndumping site for chemical toxic waste, over 21 tons during that period of <br/>\ntime.  In the 50&#39;s the dump was closed and capped and a school was built on <br/>\ntop of the capped land.  Ultimately the clay cap was disrupted and the waste <br/>\nwent to the water supply.  Kids came home with skin rashes and chemical burns <br/>\nafter playing outside.  Areas of vegetation died without any apparent reason. <br/>\n Foul-smelling liquids bubbled out of the ground.  There was a higher than <br/>\nnormal rate of birth defects, leukemia, and mental retardation.  It turned <br/>\nout that over400 chemicals were identified in the canal, some in levels <br/>\nexceeding five thousand times the maximum safe level.  Two hundred and thirty <br/>\nsix families had to leave their now worthless homes to face uncertain health <br/>\nfutures.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s the government tested nuclear bombs in Nevada and <br/>\nNew Mexico.  Over 2,000 tests have been conducted all around the world.  <br/>\nAreas surrounding test sites had high rates of birth defects and <br/>\ncancer-related illnesses from the radioactive clouds that drift above areas <br/>\nafter the detonations.  Radioactive fallout from the tests were ingested <br/>\nthrough the air and the food over the entire country.  The nation&#39;s milk <br/>\nsupply had been contaminated by strontium 90 fallout from hydrogen bomb <br/>\nexplosions.  Studies in 1983 revealed that all Americans received at least <br/>\nsome radiation fallout during that period.  People living closest to or <br/>\ndirectly downwind of the blast sites were heavily exposed.  Radioactive <br/>\nmaterials fell on farms as far away as New York State -- absorbed by crops, <br/>\nfarm animals and into the earth.  According to a study done in 1997, <br/>\nAmericans were exposed to varying levels of radioactive iodine 131 for two <br/>\nmonths following each of the ninety atomic tests in Nevada during the 50&#39;s <br/>\nand 60&#39;s, radiation extended beyond the test site and was detected as far <br/>\naway as New England and the Northwest.  Radioactive iodine accumulates in the <br/>\nthyroid gland and children, because they drink more milk than adults (and <br/>\napparently it likes milk) got 3-7 times more than the average dose of <br/>\nradiation because of the milk consumption.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBetween 1949 and 1969, the US Army released bacteria and chemical agents in <br/>\nmajor American cities including New York, San Francisco, and Washington, DC <br/>\nto simulate chemical and biological warfare.  A number of residents of those <br/>\ncities later reported unexplainable illnesses and birth-related problems.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEgads.  I could go on and on.  <br/>\n<br/>\n~Ginny<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":83524433,"authorName":"callymom2000","from":"&quot;callymom2000&quot; &lt;scenichillhomeschool@...&gt;","profile":"callymom2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Temperment Matters","postDate":"1014655808","msgId":5169,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGE1ZHEwMCs0c3VwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":5168,"nextInTopic":5170,"prevInTime":5168,"nextInTime":5170,"topicId":5113,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-970989045\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Compared to any other environment of this  culture before this <br/>\ntime it&#39;s not. <br/>\nInfant mortality in the early 20th century, children dying of flu and <br/>\nthe <br/>\nvarious fevers (scarlet, rheumatic) and polio and such, or just dying <br/>\nof no <br/>\nantibiotics, or falling into fires, or being killed by farm machinery <br/>\nor <br/>\nfactory machinery or being killed by an adult who hit him too hard <br/>\nbecause.....&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere...Here....I totally agree with this.

It&#39;s something I have<br/>\nto work to remember sometimes, as a child of an<br/>\nalcoholic home who is used to trying to please<br/>\neveryone.  I can&#39;t be responsible for the happiness or<br/>\nfeelings of others.  I can do my best and try to meet<br/>\nthem in the middle, and the rest is up to them and not<br/>\nmy &quot;fault.&quot;  One phrase that I like is &quot;This Space Not<br/>\nfor Rent&quot; or &quot;No Vacancy&quot; to remind me not to &quot;rent&quot;<br/>\nspace to others in my head, or in other words, not to<br/>\nmake THEIR problems into MY problems by taking<br/>\nposession of and responsibility for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
