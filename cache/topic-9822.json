Instead she is leaving them to her<br/>\nhusband&#39;s cousin in Oregon who the kids don&#39;t know and<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have nay children.  I have four and live near<br/>\nthem and they know me.  Go figure.  I told her isn&#39;t<br/>\nit more important that they are loved.  Although I<br/>\nhave to say if she took my children, I would not want<br/>\nthem to go to school, but at least I know they would<br/>\nbe with people that loved them.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeslie<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFaith Hill - Exclusive Performances, Videos & More<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faith.yahoo.com\">http://faith.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9821,"nextTopicId":9820}}
