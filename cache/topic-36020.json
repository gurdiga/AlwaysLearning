I do understand that these<br/>\nthese can be emotional for you, but you do not need to share that with<br/>\nher.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m copying and pasting a letter I had written my dad some time ago. <br/>\nI think I mentioned it before.  Basically in the letter I let him know<br/>\nwhat I would not be tolerating anymore.  He (as a former wrestling<br/>\ncoach) went WAY overboard when my son started getting into wrestling. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be a bit lengthy, but I will say that it did work.  I never<br/>\nheard a word from him about it.  It just changed.  Maybe a similar<br/>\nformat would help you out.  The letter isn&#39;t nice.  but the way he<br/>\nacted that day made me feel not so nice.  If someone doesn&#39;t act<br/>\ndeserving of respect, then I see no need to give it to them.  your<br/>\nmother is not a child, she doesn&#39;t need lengthy explanations of why<br/>\nshe is mean, or why no one visits.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway...  here&#39;s my letter.  I hope it helps you and if it doesn&#39;t...<br/>\n then I hope it helps someone else.  :-)  <br/>\n<br/>\n-Heather<br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\n<br/>\nDad,<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a few things I wanted to get off my chest about the wrestling<br/>\ntournament.  First of all, please do not tell me that I &quot;need to<br/>\nchill&quot; or that I&#39;m &quot;too protective&quot; with S.  You already had your<br/>\nchance to raise children, now it&#39;s my turn.  You can either be<br/>\nsupportive, or be somewhere else.  I raise S. with respect, meaning I<br/>\nrespect him, his feelings, and the things he says.  Period.  If you<br/>\nthink that&#39;s babying him, or being too protective, first, I don&#39;t<br/>\ncare, second, please reread the second and third sentences of this<br/>\nparagraph.  I find it insulting when you speak to me that way, and I<br/>\ndo not appreciate it.  I was not in a bad mood today until I started<br/>\nto disapprove of the way you treated S.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, I wouldn&#39;t let anyone speak to my any of my kids the way you<br/>\nspeak to him.  And I refuse to sit back while you do it.  If he&#39;s<br/>\nfeeling bad about something, picking on him or making fun of him or<br/>\nusing sarcasm to gain a reaction makes him feel worse and is very<br/>\nimmature.  You are his grandfather, not his father, and you should be<br/>\nthere with positive support and that&#39;s all.  Acting like a jerk only<br/>\nsucceeds in making you look like a jerk.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, if you continue to think its ok to yell at S. (or M. for that<br/>\nmatter) than you can find another car to drive or ride in.  It&#39;s not<br/>\naloud, and I won&#39;t let you do it.  S. is 9.  He acts 9.  I allow him<br/>\nto act 9.  There is no need for you to be so bossy (this bothers him<br/>\nthe most), inflexible, and loud.  It affects everyone.  If you can&#39;t<br/>\nstand to be in a car with children, then get out of the car.  Problem<br/>\nsolved.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Sandra Dodd&quot; &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t like the beginning.

Here is the draft <br/>\nof the letter to my mother. Feel FREE to change or add to this letter <br/>\nto make it not feel threatening to her. FYI: Mamaw was my mother&#39;s <br/>\nmother who just died in April and was EVIL!! My mother hated her yet <br/>\ntook care of her for about 15 years after several strokes and the <br/>\nlast 2 years she was completely bedridden yet my mother wouldn&#39;t put <br/>\nher in a nursing home out of &#39;obligation&#39; . No one liked her. Also, <br/>\nApril, Tyler and Nora are the names of my grown children.<br/>\n<br/>\nDear Mom:<br/>\n<br/>\nI love you. I want to be there for you when you need <br/>\nsomething and to have a good relationship with you.<br/>\nHowever, I won&#39;t keep listening to the insults or bringing <br/>\nLacey over to be insulted. I want you to be a good grandmother to <br/>\nher. The kind of grandmother you used to be when April was small. Not <br/>\nthe kind of Mamaw that I had � the one that hurt with her words and <br/>\nalways put me down for not living up to her unrealistic expectations <br/>\nof me. <br/>\nOthers feel the same way, but they are afraid to confront <br/>\nyou. Because of their fear they are willing to keep putting up with <br/>\nthe verbal and emotional abuse to them and their children out of a <br/>\nsense of obligation to you. I do feel an obligation to you because I <br/>\nwant to help you. I have been there for you when your other children <br/>\nleft you. I want to continue to be in your life, but I have an <br/>\nobligation to Lacey to keep her from being abused. You are crushing <br/>\nher spirit as Mamaw crushed mine. Your abuse is much the same as <br/>\nMamaw&#39;s was and I am hoping that you can look within yourself and see <br/>\nthis and perhaps make an effort to change. For all of your family <br/>\nthat are still in your life.<br/>\nApril, Tyler and Nora are grown and can make their own <br/>\ndecisions. If you want them to visit, try calling them and asking <br/>\nthem to come see you. That usually works. They don&#39;t think that you <br/>\nwant them to come over because of the way you&#39;ve talked to them and <br/>\nabout them in the past. I&#39;m no longer going to be the go-between with <br/>\nyou and them. If you want to be a grandmother to them and a great-<br/>\ngrandmother to their children, then you have to make an effort. <br/>\nThere is no longer the excuse of having to take care of Mamaw for not <br/>\ngoing by to see your grandkids or me. You don&#39;t need an invitation to <br/>\ncome to my house or to go see them. How many times have you passed <br/>\nright by my house and not stopped to see me? Yet you complain when we <br/>\ndon&#39;t come to see you.

Here is the draft <br/>\nof the letter to my mother. Feel FREE to change or add to this letter <br/>\nto make it not feel threatening to her. FYI: Mamaw was my mother&#39;s <br/>\nmother who just died in April and was EVIL!! My mother hated her yet <br/>\ntook care of her for about 15 years after several strokes and the <br/>\nlast 2 years she was completely bedridden yet my mother wouldn&#39;t put <br/>\nher in a nursing home out of &#39;obligation&#39;. No one liked her. Also, <br/>\nApril, Tyler and Nora are the names of my grown children.<br/>\n<br/>\nDear Mom:<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI love you. I want to be there for you when you need <br/>\nsomething and to have a good relationship with you.<br/>\n\tHowever, I won&#39;t keep listening to the insults or bringing <br/>\nLacey over to be insulted. I want you to be a good grandmother to <br/>\nher. The kind of grandmother you used to be when April was small. Not <br/>\nthe kind of Mamaw that I had  the one that hurt with her words and <br/>\nalways put me down for not living up to her unrealistic expectations <br/>\nof me. <br/>\n\tOthers feel the same way, but they are afraid to confront <br/>\nyou. Because of their fear they are willing to keep putting up with <br/>\nthe verbal and emotional abuse to them and their children out of a <br/>\nsense of obligation to you. I do feel an obligation to you because I <br/>\nwant to help you. I have been there for you when your other children <br/>\nleft you. I want to continue to be in your life, but I have an <br/>\nobligation to Lacey to keep her from being abused. You are crushing <br/>\nher spirit as Mamaw crushed mine. Your abuse is much the same as <br/>\nMamaw&#39;s was and I am hoping that you can look within yourself and see <br/>\nthis and perhaps make an effort to change. For all of your family <br/>\nthat are still in your life.<br/>\n       April, Tyler and Nora are grown and can make their own <br/>\ndecisions.
