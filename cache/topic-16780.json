She receives $25.00 per day - when we are out at powwows. There&#39;s one powwow she really loves - at that one, she volunteers in the cook shack or at the tribal table; at this powwow - because she doesn&#39;t work for me - she doesn&#39;t get paid. She is happy with that - no work/no money reality.<br/>\nThere is no allowance - as she gets older, she learns more about Coyotes Corner. She wanted more money - powwow season is over. She&#39;s started Mudpuppy RX - she&#39;ll be selling pet products; cat/dog First Aid kits; reflective capes; healthy chew toys; etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe also gets paid for certain jobs - and she has the right to suggest (and push through) jobs/projects. She wants to paint the living room. I really didn&#39;t care about the LR - esp. the one wall that bothered her.<br/>\nWe have the paint right here.<br/>\nShe also wants to paint my/our bedroom.

We had the<br/>\nsame experience of him wanting to spend it all the first couple weeks, and<br/>\nthen learning to save towards something he wanted more.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy having an allowance, Tim discovered that the value of money is in having<br/>\nmore of it.  He is far less likely to buy little stuff or icecream cones (on<br/>\ndays when I&#39;m not buying!), and much more likely to save and get something<br/>\nhe really wants.  It&#39;s helped him think about what he really desires and<br/>\nvalues.  We do still buy him things, of course, or we help him buy more<br/>\nexpensive things.  But it seems like we all buy less this way.  Seeing him<br/>\nbe frugal about his funds can help me remember that money doesn&#39;t grow on<br/>\ntrees, too.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; The money isn&#39;t tied to her behavior in any way.  It is the line item in the<br/>\n&gt; family budget for Lydia discretionary spending, similar to the line item that<br/>\n&gt; my husband and I each have.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Exactly.  I tell Tim that he shares in our wealth because he&#39;s part of our<br/>\nfamily.  In the same way, I ask if he would help with things around our home<br/>\nbecause he is part of our family.  At 7, he does some things now without<br/>\nbeing asked.  But when I ask, he&#39;s generally happy to help.  To me, it&#39;s<br/>\nsort of the same attitude many parents use, that chores and money are<br/>\nrelated, but in the happy, friendly way (you&#39;re part of the family) instead<br/>\nof the mean threatening way.  I don&#39;t see the need to be mean about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16807,"nextTopicId":16752}}
