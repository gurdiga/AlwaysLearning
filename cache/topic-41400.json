This is Keith Gilbert&#39;s explanation:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.neurolinguisticparents.com/WhatisNLP.htm\">http://www.neurolinguisticparents.com/WhatisNLP.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBrief and not very clear, IMHO.<br/>\n<br/>\nI first encountered NLP way back in 1990 when I bought a book out of<br/>\ncuriosity called Introducing Neuro-Linguistic Programming by Joseph<br/>\nO&#39;Connor and John Seymour, which described NLP as &quot;The New Psychology<br/>\nof Personal Excellence&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the back cover of the book:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Some people appear more gifted than others. NLP describes in simple<br/>\nterms what they do differently, and enables you to learn these<br/>\npatterns of excellence.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know about the &quot;in simple terms&quot;. The book has a glossary of<br/>\nwords I&#39;d never heard of at the time that I needed to learn to make<br/>\nsense of the book. I like things to be explained to me in plain<br/>\nEnglish, so that totally put me off NLP, until I started to see it<br/>\nbeing promoted all around the internet maybe five or six years ago,<br/>\nand I became interested in it again.<br/>\n<br/>\nNLP is the creation of John Grinder, when he was an assistant<br/>\nprofessor of linguistics at the University in California, Santa Cruz,<br/>\nand Richard Bandler, who was then a psychology student at the<br/>\nuniversity. They began collaborating in 1972 to analyse the patterns<br/>\nof speech and behaviour of three famous therapists of the day - Fritz<br/>\nPerls, Viginia Satir and Milton Erickson - so they could discover<br/>\nexactly what they said and did and thus be able to pass that on to<br/>\nother people so they could learn to say and do it too. In 1976,<br/>\nGrinder and Bandler decided to call what they were doing<br/>\nNeuro-Linguistic Programming - &quot;... a cumbersome phrase that covers<br/>\nthree simple ideas. The &#39;Neuro&#39; part of NLP acknowledges the<br/>\nfundamental idea that all behaviour stems from our neurological<br/>\nprocesses of sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch and feeling. We<br/>\nexperience the world through our five senses; we make &#39;sense&#39; of the<br/>\ninformation and then act on it. ... The &#39;Linguistic&#39; part of the title<br/>\nindicates that we use language to order our thoughts and behaviour and<br/>\nto communicate with others. The &#39;Programming&#39; part refers to ways we<br/>\ncan choose to organize our ideas and actions to produce results. NLP<br/>\ndeals with the structure of human subjective experience; how we<br/>\norganize what we see, hear and feel, and how we edit and filter the<br/>\noutside world through our senses. It also explores how we describe it<br/>\nin language and how we act, both intentionally and unintentionally, to<br/>\nproduce results.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause Grinder and Bandler&#39;s original work was with therapists, many<br/>\npeople seem to think NLP is a form of therapy, and it&#39;s often sold on<br/>\nthe internet as such, but it isn&#39;t intended to be. It&#39;s basically<br/>\nabout modelling excellence in a structured, methodical way, although<br/>\nthat can sometimes, in itself, have therapeutic benefits.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen on the internet some extraordinary and outrageous claims<br/>\nmade for NLP, usually related to reading people&#39;s minds and making<br/>\nothers obey our every whim and that kind of thing, and there&#39;s some<br/>\ncontroversy over how &#39;scientific&#39; it is, but I don&#39;t know that its<br/>\noriginators ever claimed that it was &#39;scientific&#39;. I personally don&#39;t<br/>\nregard anything related to human psychology as &#39;scientific&#39; - in fact,<br/>\nquite the opposite - but, for me, it doesn&#39;t need to be scientific to<br/>\nbe useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think NLP is very useful. I don&#39;t actually &#39;do NLP&#39; myself, but I<br/>\nrecognise in it many of the &#39;tools and techniques&#39; that have been part<br/>\nof my daily life for many years, only presented in a more<br/>\nsophisticated context. Indeed, I now have a fine collection of NLP<br/>\nbooks, mp3s and even playing cards that I often refer to. My<br/>\nunderstanding, such as it is, of how I think and what I perceive and<br/>\nhow that affects my behaviour and experiences has been conglomerated<br/>\nover the years from a variety of sources. If I had to do it all over<br/>\nagain, I&#39;d simply &#39;learn NLP&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith Gilbert&#39;s book &quot;Teenagers ...&quot; applies all the established NLP<br/>\ntools and techniques specifically to relationships between teenagers<br/>\nand their parents. There&#39;s a particular emphasis on showing teenagers<br/>\nhow grown ups use language to manipulate behaviour and how to deal<br/>\nwith that.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s what it says in the Introduction:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Teenagers<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are you going to find in this book?<br/>\n<br/>\nSome FUN!<br/>\nLanguage - how people use it and what it tells you about how they think.<br/>\nWays you can protect yourself from other people&#39;s attempts at making<br/>\nyou do things you might not want to...and don&#39;t have to do.<br/>\nWays to discover what you really want to do.<br/>\nWays to do what you really want to do.<br/>\nMental exercises that will help you free yourself from limiting ideas<br/>\nabout what you think you can and cannot do.<br/>\nHow to rebel against limiting adult thinking in safe, clever and<br/>\nstylish ways.<br/>\nHow to determine your own physical, emotional and mental wellbeing.<br/>\nHow to determine, for you, the most appropriate way to live in the<br/>\nworld with other people and the environment.<br/>\nWays to create and maintain healthy relationships.<br/>\nAn excellent adventure.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a $5 ebook version available at Lulu.com, btw.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will be attending Keith Gilbert&#39;s The Technology of Choice workshop<br/>\nin Sydney over the weekend of February 21-22, so that I have a better<br/>\ngrasp of the practicalities of NLP myself and can absorb more of its<br/>\ntools and techniques directly into my daily life.

Those made an impression on me since Kat was young at the  <br/>\ntime I read it and it was hard imagining a parent not locking the kid  <br/>\nup ;-) I understood the whole point of letting go but it was still  <br/>\nhard to imagine!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut now it&#39;s easier to imagine now that Kat&#39;s more independent.  <br/>\nControl is an illusion. But I can imagine it&#39;s harder to accept that  <br/>\nfor parents whose kids are including dangerous activities in their  <br/>\nforays into independence. And I understand the kids too. A lot of the  <br/>\ndangerous stuff is a way of saying &quot;Ha, you can&#39;t control me and I&#39;ll  <br/>\nshow you how little control you have.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is what makes the book good because she gets that we can&#39;t  <br/>\ncontrol them. All we have is the opportunity to influence them. And  <br/>\nwe can&#39;t influence them if they don&#39;t trust us.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":199360242,"authorName":"graberamy","from":"&quot;graberamy&quot; &lt;graber@...&gt;","profile":"graberamy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Books for parents having troubled relationships with their teens","postDate":"1232563867","msgId":41415,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdsN3FxcitzZWk3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDZGMTE0Njk3LTJEOEItNDQ3Ni04RkVFLTM0RDkzQ0U5RTBDMkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":41413,"nextInTopic":41416,"prevInTime":41414,"nextInTime":41416,"topicId":41400,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Is that where the fight between him and his<br/>\nfamily is?  Do they not want him NOT doing those things?  Do they<br/>\nthink doing those things make him seem like less?  Is he blowing up at<br/>\nthem because he does these things or because of the power struggle<br/>\nover them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m guessing this won&#39;t be a popular view but not everyone who tries<br/>\nor does these things for a phase means the outcome will be that they<br/>\nare an addict or uncapable of being productive people?  Granted<br/>\nstatistically your chances are much greater.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut if that&#39;s the big issue (the drugs), what if they just let it go?<br/>\n I personally am not a big fan of pot, I&#39;m already pretty laid back so<br/>\nI don&#39;t need something to bring me down.  But some people are wired<br/>\nmore tightly and it&#39;s their way of self medicating.  Cocaine and other<br/>\ndrugs while I would totally recommend staying away from them, I do<br/>\nunderstand the desire to experiment and see what the hype is about.  I<br/>\nknow quite a few people who have tried this and never became addicts<br/>\nor even frequent users. <br/>\n<br/>\nCaffeine, I used it for years.  I can&#39;t stand it now, but it took me<br/>\nyears to figure out that my body doesn&#39;t handle caffeine very well. <br/>\nIf my parents would have told me not to use it, that would have made<br/>\nme want to use it even more. <br/>\n<br/>\nCiggies, we&#39;re in a big anti smoking world right now.  I used to smoke<br/>\nfrequently.  But now I still smoke occasionally...like if I go out<br/>\nwith friends.  I don&#39;t smoke daily.  Not everyone who smokes is<br/>\naddicted to nicotine...again your chances go way up.  But many people<br/>\nwho are addicted to nicotine, do quit.  Isn&#39;t this his decision??<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you&#39;re asking for book advice and I&#39;m not sure if there is a book<br/>\nout there that would say let your kids experiment.  Let them possibly<br/>\nrisk their health and their lives.  But IMO, if they can continue to<br/>\nbe supportive of him and maybe let some of the control go, they&#39;ll<br/>\nimprove their relationship.
