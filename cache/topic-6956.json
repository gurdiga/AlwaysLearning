I found that with my girls letting them make their own &quot;fashion&quot; choices works best. That is as long as it is appropriate for the occasion. My oldest dd used to give me a really hard time about her clothes too. Everything had to be &quot;just so&quot; or she wouldn&#39;t wear it. So, I started letting her pick her own clothes out when we shop, again within reason. I made a few rules, that were to me reasonable limits. Some were, no 2 piece bathing suits, no short shorts, not sleeveless shirts. Just things that were important to me. The rest is for her to decide. I also let both girls wear what is comfortable around the house, except our house rule is, everyone must be dressed.... : )<br/>\n<br/>\nI think, if you let her wear the bathing suit, and don&#39;t make a big deal out of it, you will find that she will give it up on her own. I would let her know that when you go out, she must choose something other than the bathing suit. I have found with my girls that the more I try to interfere the more they fight me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this is helpful,<br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Mary Hickman <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, May 14, 2002 7:08 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Girls and questions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hello everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m Mary, mom to Riley 5 Ashley 7.5 and tessa 2.5.
