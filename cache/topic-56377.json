I used to think sit down meals were so important, family time right, my husband was not on board even though that is the way he was brought up as well.  It caused so much stress for me and it made me angry that he would only sit with us for a few minutes and never eat.  It finally got through to me.  He is inside all day and want to be outside when he is home.  He doesn&#39;t like to eat until pretty much before he goes to bed because he is tired and eating makes him want to sleep.  So now, if the kids are hungry, we&#39;ll come and sit in the garage to eat and mull around outside with him.  Sometimes we just eat at 9:00 standing up in the kitchen together.  You can bet these are better family dinner time memories.  I think it is better to make adjustments than to have negative memories of events.  How awful to have my kids remember, Oh I hated dinner time.  My Dad didn&#39;t want to be there and my mom was always trying to force him.  It is a sort of un main stream parenting process.  Getting rid of ideas that have been drilled into me, or that I have read from the experts about how family life should be instead of living joyously in our own way.<br/>\nJoanne</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56372,"nextTopicId":55837}}
