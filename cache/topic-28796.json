Re: Freedom of Choice - Multiple children<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the meanest things my mom ever used to say to me was &quot;that&#39;s<br/>\nlife.&quot;  It was never said sympathetically, and often the frustration<br/>\nwas clearly of her own creation, and not &quot;life.&quot;  It was MY life,<br/>\nbecause I was stuck with her, but every time she said it I was more<br/>\ndetermined to be far from her when I could be.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the meanest things I heard was &quot;Well, Life&#39;s not fair.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEven before unschooling, I figured *my* job was to make my HOME as <br/>\n*fair* a place to be as I could.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize life may not be fair, but that didn&#39;t mean I should make our <br/>\nlives that way too. If I made our home a fair and comfy spot to land <br/>\nafter an *unfair* day at school (or whereeever), Cameron might know <br/>\nthat we were always there for him---even when the world is unfair.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want my kids to know that I am always here to right what I can and to <br/>\nmake things as fair as I can for them. Home should be a *safe* place!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAOL now offers free email to everyone.
