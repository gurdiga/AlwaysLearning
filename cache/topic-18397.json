Logan was already there having slept there, but he woke up. The Gracie woke up so we had her in the bed, then Sarah joined us. <br/>\n <br/>\nWe sang some children&#39;s songs for a few minutes, then headed out to the living room. Paul came home shortly afterwards, and I headed out to the store for some milk. We had breakfast when I came back - biscuits and honey. By the time we&#39;d eaten it was time for me to head to the dentist. I have no idea what they did while I was gone. When I got home, Megan was ready for her nap so we settled in to watch &quot;Seven Alone&quot; (based on the book &quot;On To Oregon&quot; By Honore&#39; Morrow as told by Catherine Sanger). <br/>\n <br/>\nMegan and Gracie have both tried to nap but been woke up by Logan being too loud. Right now he&#39;s watching &quot;There Goes A Firetruck&quot; (after asking me nicely if he could stop my movie since I had jumped on the computer to go through my emails after Paul got on it). <br/>\n <br/>\nHere in a few minutes I have to go wash some dishes so I can get dinner fixed....no idea what will happen through the rest of the evening...Sarah&#39;s been over at a friend&#39;s all afternoon, by the way. <br/>\n <br/>\nMamaBeth<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer and Scott Lynch &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:j.slynch@...\">j.slynch@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nEvie (3 3/4) woke up this morning and started her day with peanut butter and<br/>\njelly in bed (the usual).
