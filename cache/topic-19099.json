He doesn&#39;t like it.  I told him it <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; would be really helpful to everyone else if he liked it because it&#39;s so <br/>\n&gt; cheap <br/>\n&gt; and easy to make.  Usually he has just the sauce, with toast or rice, which <br/>\n&gt; is <br/>\n&gt; okay too, really.  So he said he would try again and I gave him a small <br/>\n&gt; portion which he took to eat in another room. I don&#39;t know whether he liked <br/>\n&gt; it; I&#39;ll <br/>\n&gt; ask next spaghetti day.    I&#39;m just telling this because Marty&#39;s 15 and it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; not just toddler-parents whose kids have an aversion that they might or <br/>\n&gt; might <br/>\n&gt; not grow out of. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hey I did this with my son in law.  He hates tomatoes he said.  I asked him <br/>\nwhen the last time he tried them, after all he loves sauce and ketchup.  He <br/>\nwilling tried it again after admitting it had been years, shook his head no and <br/>\nwent to the trash.  Something about the texture.  Caitlin my daughter won&#39;t eat <br/>\nspaghetti but she will eat the sausage when I cook it in the sauce.  She eats <br/>\negg noodles with gravy though.  She hates spaghetti too.
