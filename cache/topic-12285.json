Not a mention of duck tape or plastic, as if that would<br/>\n&gt;&gt;help, honestly. What is up with this?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I dunno!  There is a lot of fear around this whole thing, and I think<br/>\n&gt; people may feel powerless to do anything about it and not want to<br/>\n&gt; acknowledge it.  But &quot;I dunno&quot; is the only *correct* answer I can come up<br/>\n&gt; with.  I know that I feel sensitive about bringing this topic up on this<br/>\n&gt; list and the unschooling list because I don&#39;t want to cause a diversion<br/>\n&gt; from the unschooling topics.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t talk about it on homeschooling lists because I&#39;m not interested in<br/>\ndebating it. :) I&#39;m also not feeling any more afraid or powerless over this<br/>\nthan anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t mind posts like Marji&#39;s and I don&#39;t fret over them just because<br/>\nwe&#39;re on different sides of this particular issue. I would find it tedious<br/>\nif pro or anti war posts became the order of the day on any of the lists I<br/>\nfrequent, but we seem to find other things to talk about, too, and I have a<br/>\ngood working delete key. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12279,"nextTopicId":12306}}
