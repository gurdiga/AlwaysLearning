In other words, your 9 year old hangs out with his big brother and older friends because he has no one in his age group to interact with. I&#39;m just assuming that, though since you mentioned how small your town is. The other thing I wonder is, does your oldest complain about his little brother hanging out with him and his friends? If not then it may not be as much of a problem as you think. If I were you I&#39;d find out how the 12 year old feels and if he&#39;s okay with how things are, let it be for now. At their age I believe they can start making good choices about who their friends are and who they aren&#39;t. Your older son can help your younger one figure those things out, too. But again, I don&#39;t think you have anything to feel responsible for if I read your post correctly. In hope things get better for all of you.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;barefootcdh&quot; &lt;chill74@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I trust this place, more than any other, to answer this question more honestly and with the collective wisdom for what I need to help my children...I have two boys - one 12 (13 in November) and one 9.

That way you can break up the dynamics a bit and give the kids some space while making it something fun, too. From the description you gave, you could just set up playdates for the 9yo with a single friend rather than the whole crew. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing I would look into is trying to find clubs or classes for your guys outside this small town - which could mean some driving to a bigger town! What sorts of things do your guys like? It may be that one will like one thing and the other something different, but again that gives you a chance to set up playdates for one child while the other goes off to karate class or whatever. That will help broaden their social circle so there&#39;s less overlap, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":323780322,"authorName":"barefootcdh","from":"&quot;barefootcdh&quot; &lt;chill74@...&gt;","profile":"barefootcdh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Sibling Separation and Growth","postDate":"1310080701","msgId":61798,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGl2NWVydCs3NTJlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":61802,"prevInTime":61797,"nextInTime":61799,"topicId":61798,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I trust this place, more than any other, to answer this question more honestly and with the collective wisdom for what I need to help my children...I have two","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1237366113\">I trust this place, more than any other, to answer this question more honestly and with the collective wisdom for what I need to help my children...I have two boys - one 12 (13 in November) and one 9.
