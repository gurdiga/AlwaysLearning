And if a kid knows school will be back in a couple of months, he&#39;s not likely to get the urge to explore any &quot;school topics&quot; for fun on his own.  If grades are involved, and he&#39;s trained to the tests and the scores, he&#39;s also learned that what&#39;s not going to be on the test is not important, not real, a waste of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of weeks ago I happened on a small discussion where someone was saying yes, her kids were in school, but she was still working out how to school AND unschool concurrently.

Those two terms made sense to me, but even then I could how much overlap there was.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-It didn&#39;t make sense to me to trust kids to learn, but not to trust them with what they ate. I think maybe academic unschooling blended in with eclectic homeschooling? -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe.  I could kind of get behind academic unschooling, though I think it would work best for younger kids than teens, partly because the relationship building would not be there.  And I also think the parents would be less involved with younger kids, too, waiting for them to discover things the parents already knew and had learned in school, because if &quot;academic&quot; is a principle factor, then the overlay of success, grades, passing and graduation are still intact.   It would be an alternative way to gain the same knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Kirby was five, six, I probably vaguely figured all that, BUT I was already, for many more years, involved in letting him eat if he wanted to and not to press him to eat (or even taste) things if the didn&#39;t appeal to him, or if he wasn&#39;t hungry.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we had been already for several years NOT &quot;putting kids down for naps,&quot; but I would nurse them to sleep (Kirby and Marty) or drive them to sleep or sing them to sleep or they would fall asleep watching a video (VCRs were fairly new :-).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for me, the attachment parenting was extending beyond a breastfeeding relationship, and then we added unschooling to it when Kirby was four and nearly five.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a family comes to it all of a sudden, it can&#39;t help but be overwhelming and confusing.  We were fortunate to have had it seep in, and having known two unschooling families already, and reading Growing Without Schooling in a kind of gradual way, too.  I wish it had come more often, but it was a kind of enforced &quot;read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch.&quot;    Pam Laricchia&#39;s intro series has that, but you only need to wait three or four days, not two months. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem I see (back to the quote from Gwen at the top of this e-mail) is that some people do NOT want to be &quot;academic unschoolers.&quot;  They DO want their kids to learn a new and different array of things they come upon naturally, and they&#39;re willing to let go of the outline of the school&#39;s curriculum.  At the same time, though, they want to manage their children&#39;s time, and input (physically and otherwise).    I worry that those kids will have the many disadvantages of too much control without the consolation prize of &quot;an education.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have said sometimes that fundamentalist Christians take their kids out because they think schools are not controlling enough, and give kids too much information.   Radical unschoolers take their kids out because they think schools don&#39;t give enough information, and are too controlling.   That keeps us from being &quot;the same,&quot; and that&#39;s why I&#39;ve never had any interest in &quot;supporting all homeschoolers.&quot;   I would rather those other kids be in school than home being told lies about the world, and being punished if they don&#39;t recite them back correctly and quickly.   (And I know this is a problem that might not exist outside a social subset in the United States, so don&#39;t even start defending fundamentalist Christians if you&#39;ve never lived in the southern or conservative rural U.S., because we&#39;re probably not talking about the same thing at all.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIF, though, a family homeschools for some other combination of objections to school, I won&#39;t be able to defend (nor have I any oblgation to defend) their reasoning or outcomes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":504505579,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Appropriating the word Unschooling","postDate":"1363108229","msgId":70923,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBT09UYVhNV0F1b09XOGlPUDdCQmF0ZmE5WnhIODNjelN6Z1hSTnlORmktc0Z5ZXNQUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNjMxMDA1MzYuNjQ5MTAuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE4MjIwMi5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGtobWc1aCt1YjhwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8MzIxQzAxMjQtOEE3RC00MTM4LUE4RjAtMERBQTc0MERBQkJEQGdtYWlsLmNvbT4JPDEzNjMxMDA1MzYuNjQ5MTAuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE4MjIwMi5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":70922,"nextInTopic":70924,"prevInTime":70922,"nextInTime":70924,"topicId":70860,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I know lots and lots of unschoolers who don t extend their unschooling ideas to learning everything - sleep, housework, behavior, eating, etc. Lots of them","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1287992887\">I know lots and lots of unschoolers who don&#39;t extend their unschooling<br/>\nideas to learning everything - sleep, housework, behavior, eating, etc.<br/>\nLots of them have really strict food rules, for example.

Â When in practice with my children, those &quot;differences&quot; can mean moving about peacefully with my kids or creating discord. Â Those things don&#39;t seem like small differences to me. Â If unschooling means everything in the whole world to whoever decides it to be so, then it loses all meaning entirely. Â <br/>\n<br/>\nIt kind of goes into a chain of thought like this, Unschooling is an educational choice, under the heading homeschooling, where there is a focus on learning without curriculum, and the learning is happy and peaceful, so parents need to find a way to make life peaceful and happy, which in turn impacts the nature of the relationship between parent and child. Â Anything added into that either makes that better or worse. Â <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the small difference is that I have enforced family time, how does that help or hinder the relationship aspect of unschooling? Â If that small difference is that I only buy organic food, how does impact happy learning? Â If I unschool everything but math, how does that change the way I view curriculum and the learning process?<br/>\n<br/>\nThose things aren&#39;t little differences, they are every bit a part of what makes unschooling work well or not. Â Sure, people can do whatever they want to do. Â What I don&#39;t understand though, is why in the world anyone would want to call themselves an unschooler, or attach themselves to that as a label unless they are really actually unschooling. Â Why not just tell people that you are a relaxed homeschooler and leave it at that. Â  In day to day life I generally refer to our family as homeschoolers. Â If people want details I can go into that, but I don&#39;t normally do so. Â The only time I talk about unschooling is around other unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s best to assume that there is a common definition of what that is if you are going to discuss details of day to day lives. Â There is a common working definition for this group as well as some other places online. Â Certainly, if you don&#39;t agree, you are free to go elsewhere, where whatever definition you&#39;ve decided it should be, will be accepted. Â People do that all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf those other definitions end up standing the test of time, I&#39;m sure someone will include it in the unschooling wikipedia page, since that is a working and changing page with some core ideas that never change. Â That page needs a lot of work. Â There have been many many changes to it over the years and yet those core ideas still haven&#39;t changed, like not using curriculum, and that learning is innate. Â I feel pretty confident in saying that anyone who is using a curriculum to educate their child, is doing something other than unschooling. Â It doesn&#39;t even matter, at that point what they ARE doing, we can safely rule out unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Appropriating the word Unschooling","postDate":"1363036666","msgId":70909,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVDMEVDQTA0LUFBMDktNEFCNC1CNkY1LTk2MjgzOTk1Q0Y3N0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEQzQzlCQzZCLUY2MTMtNDJGMy04Q0ZDLUQ5MDFBMkMwMDgwN0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PEQzQzlCQzZCLUY2MTMtNDJGMy04Q0ZDLUQ5MDFBMkMwMDgwN0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":70899,"nextInTopic":70911,"prevInTime":70908,"nextInTime":70910,"topicId":70860,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There was post I deleted for being more antagonistic than is ever useful, but I will quote the text of it. _________ Dare I say it?

Lots of accusations of us being anal and rigid.   It started after some comments about &quot;structure&quot;, which seems to be a euphemism for schoolish programs:- <br/>\n-=- &quot;Unschooling&quot; doesn&#39;t preclude any structure and if your child enjoys it, and benefits from it, then why wouldn&#39;t you do it? -=-<br/>\n-=- There are some things best learned through a structured program and many unschooled children choose to follow them for various subjects -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of us have been trying to delineate the difference between unschooling and eclectic homeschooling, but lots of the eclectic people seem to identify as unschoolers.  At the same time they reject some of the key features of unschooling as we talk about it here - natural learning being fundamental, for example.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the most recent discussion, one of the eclectic people referred to what I would call unschoolers, as &quot;very radical unschoolers&quot;.  The Pythonesque term made me chuckle, but I think it also points to their appropriating of the term unschooling to describe themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe also said &quot;I really don&#39;t think there would be many people who freely unschool more than I do.&quot;  It seems that being the &#39;unschoolingest&#39; ;) is desirable.  But what they do with their kids is the mix that I think is best referred to as eclectic homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps &quot;eclectic&quot; has connotations of being wishy washy and formless, putting people off identifying with it.  Unschoolers are enthusiastic and have conferences and are an identifiable group, like an active political party.  Eclectic homeschoolers don&#39;t have any of that, as far as I&#39;m aware.  For some people, the appeal of belonging to a group is strong, especially when they are not part of the mainstream.  An identifiable subculture.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the majority of people who call themselves unschoolers in my country, look to educational outcomes for their children.<br/>\n<br/>\nShifting of the meaning of labels happens in politics, religion and other areas.  Maybe something like that will happen with &#39;unschooling&#39;.  I hope we&#39;re not left with &quot;Very Radical Unschooling&quot;, though!<br/>\n<br/>\nDebbie. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 11/03/2013, at 1:30 AM, Joyce Fetteroll wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s been a dust up on a local list.

It&#39;s been slowly filling with people who stretch the definition of unschooling to the breaking point. I couldn&#39;t understand their desire to defend being on the list. It seemed to go beyond territorial.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen someone posted this:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;In discussions I have had with other mothers, I<br/>\n&gt; have learned that by not following any curriculum and organizing around my<br/>\n&gt; daughters interests I really have my foot in both [homeschool and unschool] camps. To be honest, I could<br/>\n&gt; care less about any label. I just do what works for her and for our little<br/>\n&gt; family.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>She doesn&#39;t identify as an unschooler but she and others are defending their &quot;I just do what works for her and for our little family&quot; approach on the unschooling list. Then when the unschoolers want to confine the talk to unschooling, they get upset.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it struck me that &quot;do what works for us&quot; homeschoolers don&#39;t have a phrase that they identify with. Maybe &quot;home schooling&quot; sounds too much like doing school at home. So when they look for a group that sounds something like what they want, the only specialty groups they&#39;re likely to find are Unschooling and Christian ;-) <br/>\n<br/>\nThere used to be the term eclectic home learning. I&#39;d say it perfectly describes what these parents want. But it never got big. Maybe it was too identified with Christians? (It was Barb .... can&#39;t remember her last name, I think, who coined the term. I remember she wanted it to be inclusive, but maybe there were too many Christians around her that anyone else felt uncomfortable.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat term needs revived so the &quot;do what works for my family&quot; folks can stop thinking they can use the word &quot;unschooling&quot; to describe what they&#39;re doing ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71263,"nextTopicId":71241}}
