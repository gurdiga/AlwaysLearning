My children are<br/>\nyoung (4 and 2.5 and baby) so I was not sure that they would like it, but we<br/>\nstarted by reading the books at night (they are full of action) and<br/>\ndiscussing things that are similar or different in our lives. Also, linking<br/>\nto our relatives who are old or dead  and lived lives similar to a pioneer<br/>\nfamily. My daughter has fully transformed rooms in her vivid reenactments of<br/>\nscenes. She and her brother have used laundry baskets to make covered<br/>\nwagons, they have made stocking out of paper and filled them with the same<br/>\nthings that Laura and her sibs got for xmas, we go for weeks where we have<br/>\nto call her Mary and her younger brother Laura etc. One interesting thing I<br/>\ndid was look for picture on the internet for anything they might be<br/>\nunfamiliar with. I printed them out and we now have a box full of picture of<br/>\nwolves, tee pees, moccasins, covered wagons, the real family members etc. We<br/>\neven found a recording of wolves howling online and played it over and over<br/>\nwhile Eva made her dad look out the windows with his &quot;gun&quot; to see the<br/>\nwolves. We also rented the dvds and watched several of them and noted the<br/>\ndifferences of the story with the tv show. I ordered her a bonnet fand a<br/>\nsleeping cap from ebay which she has fun with. 99% of this is initiated by<br/>\nmy daughter and I just work hard to facilitate her interest. It comes and<br/>\ngoes in spurts but overall this is a topic she is very intrigued by. It has<br/>\nbeen a great example for me about how delving into new topics can spark new<br/>\ninterests and vivid discussions. I am a young (in experience, not age) but<br/>\nconvinced &quot;unschooler&quot;!<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 8/7/06, queenjane555 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:queenjane555@...\">queenjane555@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Do your children initiate these conversations or do you?
