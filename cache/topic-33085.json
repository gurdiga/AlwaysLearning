She is very bright and as a<br/>\n&gt; home learner last year, she found some amazing things to do. She loves<br/>\n&gt; to be busy and she is very social. Are some kids really better off in<br/>\n&gt; school? I want to insist she try unschooling again but that seems so<br/>\n&gt; un-unschooling-ish. Is it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not unschooling and I&#39;m not advocating it... there is a Free School in<br/>\nPortland, where you dd could feel like she&#39;s &quot;part of a school&quot; AND have the<br/>\nfreedom to follow her own path. I only know this school exists because<br/>\nthey&#39;re coming to the Life is Good<br/>\nConference&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lifeisgoodconference.com\">http://lifeisgoodconference.com</a>&gt;in May... It&#39;s an option<br/>\nand it&#39;s an option between unschooling and<br/>\ntraditional school -- a compromise of sorts :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a single mother, with no father in the picture, I think about how my<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; son will become a man. I think about how his having complete freedom<br/>\n&gt; now will impact his future. I wonder if this path is really better in<br/>\n&gt; the long run. Then things happen to bring me back to feeling absolutely<br/>\n&gt; right about where we are. The other day, an old friend called to tell<br/>\n&gt; me that his ds age 17 was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Talk about<br/>\n&gt; perspective. That very day, my ds asked me if I had time to help him<br/>\n&gt; make chocolate dipped strawberries and pretzels. Of course there was<br/>\n&gt; time. Later he told me how much fun it had been for him. He told me<br/>\n&gt; how much he loved his life now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My dh died when my son was 2, he has no actual memories of his dad... I used<br/>\nto have big Fear about the &quot;lack of daddy&quot; in his life and I realized Life<br/>\nwithout Dad and with a Fearful Mama was probably worse than Life with out<br/>\nDad and a Self-Assured Mama, so I kicked the fear!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also a mama who got to spend the most of her daughter&#39;s short 9.5 years<br/>\nof life in Joyful Freedom! I have no regrets that I gave my child the gift<br/>\nof freedom before it was too late...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have lots of family members and friends that tell me constantly how<br/>\n&gt; his happiness now is not enough to justify the damage that his lifestyle<br/>\n&gt; will do to his future life. Could that be true?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sure, it *could* be. We *could be* all sucked up by a tornado, too. Life is<br/>\nfull of amazing possibilities, not all of them sunny and bright... My goal<br/>\nis to make a whole string of Nows that are joyful and free, which<br/>\n(especially for Hannah) becomes a whole life of joy and freedom.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf the *damaged* adults I know, all of them have been through the public<br/>\nschool system. I&#39;ve yet to meet *anyone* damaged by joy and freedom. Send<br/>\nyour family members to do their own homework (hee hee), let them research<br/>\nunschooling and find out for themselves (sandradodd.com/unschooling or<br/>\njoyfullyrejoycing.com to begin) if their Truths are really True (chances are<br/>\nthey&#39;ll either read and figure out they&#39;ve been deluded or they won&#39;t read<br/>\nand stand firm in their own experiences & the &quot;if it was good enough for<br/>\nme...&quot; mentality). School tends to make people really really afraid of life<br/>\noutside of the box.

Of course I had no idea what I was talking about.  I<br/>\nhave 2 kids, dd 10 and ds 16.  They both attended ps until about a year<br/>\nand a half ago when I took them both out at their request.  At the time,<br/>\nwe lived in CA in an area where there were no other homeschool (let<br/>\nalone unschooling) kids.  We have since moved to Portland, OR and things<br/>\nare very different here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are the things I am struggling with now:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, my dd insisted on going back to ps when we moved here. She says<br/>\nshe loves school.  Sometimes she says she doesn&#39;t want to go, and I<br/>\nalways encourage her to stay home (even though the school has &#39;talked&#39;<br/>\nto us about too many missed days).  Next year is Jr. High for her and I<br/>\nREALLY want her to give it a miss.  She really wants to go to school. <br/>\nAm I being selfish in wanting her home?  She is very bright and as a<br/>\nhome learner last year, she found some amazing things to do.  She loves<br/>\nto be busy and she is very social.  Are some kids really better off in<br/>\nschool?  I want to insist she try unschooling again but that seems so<br/>\nun-unschooling-ish.  Is it?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have watched her change as she tries to fit in with all the various<br/>\nsocial groups in school and it makes me feel sad that she feels<br/>\ncompelled to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy ds has taken to being free very well.  He would never go back.  He<br/>\nalways enjoyed the learning part of school but not the social scene and<br/>\nthe peer pressure.  He has gone through lots of changes in the past<br/>\nyear.  I am sure he would not have had the opportunity to explore his<br/>\nown mind in so much depth if he hadn&#39;t been unschooling. He is a very<br/>\ndeep thinker and he spends hours and hours talking to people from all<br/>\nover the world on line.  He is also fascinated with metaphysics.  He has<br/>\nhis own radio show where he interviews leaders of strange religions and<br/>\ncults. He takes acting classes and is in 2 plays at the moment.  He is<br/>\ndoing a wonderful job of teaching me how to be more tolerant and<br/>\naccepting (through his work and through his personal choices).  I have a<br/>\nhard time not getting crazy when he stays up all night talking to people<br/>\non the other side of the world and then sleeps half the day.  Then I<br/>\nhave to ask myself why it matters when he sleeps and when he is awake? <br/>\nThen I think, how will he ever learn responsibility and be able to work<br/>\nor go to college?   Do other parents of teens go through this?  What do<br/>\nyou do?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also gone through lots of changes.  I thought I knew what<br/>\nunschooling was when I started.  Now I think it&#39;s more a way of life<br/>\nthan a thing.  I have loved it and hated it.  For me, dealing with my<br/>\nown feelings about things has been the hardest and most rewarding part. <br/>\nThe clearer I get, the more peace I have.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a single mother, with no father in the picture, I think about how my<br/>\nson will become a man.  I think about how his having complete freedom<br/>\nnow will impact his future.  I wonder if this path is really better in<br/>\nthe long run.  Then things happen to bring me back to feeling absolutely<br/>\nright about where we are.  The other day, an old friend called to tell<br/>\nme that his ds age 17 was diagnosed with terminal cancer.  Talk about<br/>\nperspective.  That very day, my ds asked me if I had time to help him<br/>\nmake chocolate dipped strawberries and pretzels.  Of course there was<br/>\ntime.  Later he told me how much fun it had been for him.  He told me<br/>\nhow much he loved his life now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have lots of family members and friends that tell me constantly how<br/>\nhis happiness now is not enough to justify the damage that his lifestyle<br/>\nwill do to his future life.
