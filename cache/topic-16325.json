Here&#39;s <br/>\nthe description:<br/>\n<br/>\nThis group is for those who are unschooling and dealing with serious <br/>\nmental illness in the family.<br/>\n<br/>\nOften we find that as unschoolers we have a different mindset from our <br/>\nmore mainstream family and friends. This is a forum for getting together <br/>\nwith those who share a philosophy as well as a challenge.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ll be available for support and advice, as well as just being able to <br/>\nhang out with someone who really does understand what we&#39;re going through.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe link is: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolingMI/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolingMI/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll be posting this to all the new HEM lists and to Sandra&#39;s list, but <br/>\nif you&#39;re on another Unschooling list, would you help spread the word, <br/>\nplease. I think this list will fill a real need that many families don&#39;t <br/>\nknow how to address.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nDiane</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16275,"nextTopicId":16326}}
