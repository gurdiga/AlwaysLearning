I&#39;ve learned it&#39;s not important enough to get<br/>\nworked up about, and that my opinion is only that, no<br/>\nmore valid than theirs.  My parents were and are still<br/>\nvery judgemental and sanctimonious so my &quot;defaults&quot;<br/>\nwere set there I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy boys just recently discovered the Power Rangers<br/>\nmovies, being somewhat emotionally and developmentall<br/>\n&quot;young&quot; for their ages.  Some of them are pretty bad,<br/>\nas in bad acting, bad writing, bad directing, bad<br/>\nediting, cheesy effects.  Some of them are not half<br/>\nbad though.  The boys are savvy enough movie viewers<br/>\nto pick up on the bad/cheesy/poor quality stuff all by<br/>\nthemselves and we have quite a lot of fun laughing<br/>\ntogether about characters falling 1000 feet screaming<br/>\nonly to dust themselves off without a scratch and then<br/>\nlater tripping and breaking their arm or whatever. <br/>\nThe boys like to go back and watch particularly funny<br/>\nthings again and again, laughing every time. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust like the scene in Kung Pow (a favorite here)<br/>\nwhere Steve Odekirk is making fun of poor continuity<br/>\nbetween scenes with costuming and Evil Betty says &quot;I<br/>\nam a great magician!  You&#39;re clothes are Red!&quot;  then<br/>\nlater &quot;Your clothes are blue!&quot; and so forth - there<br/>\nare similar things in some of the Power Ranger shows<br/>\nwhere we laugh about the magic hat that repeatedly<br/>\ndisappears and reappears, or the &quot;Power Ranger Magic<br/>\nShiny Pants&quot; that repel dirt and inexplicably go from<br/>\nfilthy to sparkling so often.  All this seems to<br/>\nenhance their pleasure and enjoyment of their movies.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids are intelligent enough and experienced enough<br/>\nas movie viewers to pick up on that stuff and enjoy<br/>\nnoticing it, and I can put aside my dislike to be<br/>\nrespectful about their choices as well as being honest<br/>\nabout things that are well done, well acted or<br/>\nscripted and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23697,"nextTopicId":23714}}
