My youngest, Solvij, she&#39;s 7, is<br/>\nreally interested in numbers right now. This week she was looking at a book<br/>\ncalled Puzzle Mountain we&#39;ve read a few times. There&#39;s a page in it with<br/>\npictures of tables of snacks with prices for each on little signs. The<br/>\npuzzle is if you have 10 pp, how many snacks can you buy.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe wrote on a piece of paper 10 and then started figuring out how many<br/>\nsnacks to get. So she chose the first one, which cost 2pp. She counted it<br/>\nout on her fingers and then wrote down 8, how much she had left. Then she<br/>\nkept going until she got to 0.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the interesting thing to me is that she&#39;s been using her fingers like a<br/>\nnumber line for quite a while now and she knows the written symbol for each<br/>\nfinger. She still doesn&#39;t know how to say the name of all the numbers. When<br/>\nshe wrote down 8, she asked me what that number was called. And the other<br/>\nthing is that she has her own names for some numbers. She says 1,2,3,4,5,6,<br/>\nand 7. But she calls 8 &quot;snowman without a head,&quot; 9 is &quot;upside down 6,&quot; 10<br/>\nis &quot;all the fingers,&quot; or &quot;both hands,&quot; and 20 is &quot;all the hands and feet.&quot;<br/>\nThe rest of us have started using her names, and I&#39;m going to really miss<br/>\nit when she calls numbers by their regular old names.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen she was playing a Pokemon game on the gameboy and she had a piece of<br/>\npaper and pencil next to her. She told me she was keeping track of<br/>\ndifferent trainers she had battled and how many times she battled them. She<br/>\nmade a little chart with circles that she then Xed out.
