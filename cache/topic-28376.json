Below is my question ( post<br/>\n#28376). We ended up buying the &quot;Simply Music &quot;DVD&#39;s ( explained below)<br/>\nand my kids and I instantly began playing  songs.  The DVD does teach<br/>\none how to properly position your hands,  play chords, etc...   without<br/>\nall the boring repititious learning of scales and notes,  until one has<br/>\nlearned about a 30 song repretoir.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never prodded my kids to play.  They periodically will just begin<br/>\nplaying on their own, which unfortunately can be a good month or more<br/>\nbetween playing.  But, ironically just yesterday evening my 9 year<br/>\nstarted playing the piano on her own, of songs she had learned from the<br/>\nDVD.

Both my  kids <br/>\nand I took some piano lessons when we were about 7, 10 and 47.  A  traditional <br/>\napproach although I didn&#39;t really say much about practicing.   Our teacher <br/>\nwas my sister who lived next door which was convenient.  My son  took lessons <br/>\nfor about a year, my daughter about 3 years and I made it through  one book <br/>\nwhich took me about a year.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt seemed we each just stopped having a strong interest in the weekly  <br/>\nlessons and moved on to other things.  My son took guitar lessons for a few  weeks <br/>\nbut just didn&#39;t enjoy it at all at that age. My daughter got into singing  and <br/>\nloved everything about it and has continued with that for years. She started  <br/>\nguitar lessons a couple of years ago. My son recently started some drum  <br/>\nlessons.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo now, the kids are 14 and 17 and I&#39;m older also...&lt;g&gt;  Music  just <br/>\ncontinued to be a big part of our lives and we now have a piano, 4 guitars  and a drum <br/>\nset.  For a while, my son also played an ocarina and a  harmonica.  Both kids <br/>\nlove playing music and most all they play now is from  hearing something they <br/>\nlike and looking up the music online and then playing  it.  During part of <br/>\nevery day, our house has some singing, guitar playing  and drumming going on.  <br/>\nSometimes the kids just jam together and it&#39;s very  cool.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think just having the instruments around was the biggest thing and I  never <br/>\nsaid anything about times when none of them were being played. The piano  <br/>\nlessons were a good foundation for an introduction to reading music and the  <br/>\nbasics and I have no idea if they would have developed their interests if we  <br/>\nhadn&#39;t taken the lessons.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m the one who has the most difficulty with pursuing my interest in  playing <br/>\nthe guitar right now.  However, that&#39;s a completely different post  and one <br/>\nmore about my difficulty with following my passions than  anything about <br/>\nlessons.<br/>\n <br/>\nEven when no one was playing the instruments, I liked having them  around.   <br/>\nI love the piano  and the guitars.  It&#39;s amazing  how many people will just <br/>\nsit down and play something when they are here.   I&#39;m still getting used to the <br/>\ndrums.

I thought about the same stuff for years, because my  <br/>\nkids have also always been very interested in music. And, yes, too- <br/>\nearly formal lessons DID kill their initial interest in certain  <br/>\ninstruments and I&#39;m extremely sorry to not have protected them more.  <br/>\nSo, yeah, worth worrying over. When they ever wanted any kind of  <br/>\nmusic lessons, after that, I was really clear with the teacher that  <br/>\nwe were not going to be enforcing practice time and that the point  <br/>\nwas for them to have a good time, not to be scolded or pressured.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - to your real question. The program sounds pretty fun and, if it  <br/>\nwas me with my kids, I might buy it, depending on the cost. I  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t introduce it to them as a replacement for lessons, but just  <br/>\nsomething cool and fun that they might enjoy. I would treat it no  <br/>\ndifferently than if you bought a movie or a game or a new piece of  <br/>\nplay equipment or a toy for them. As I said before, be prepared for  <br/>\nthe possibility that it may not, in fact, appeal to them. If that  <br/>\nhappens, don&#39;t push it. Put it away - maybe it&#39;ll appeal later,  <br/>\nprobably not.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen this happen though -- kids show an interest in something,  <br/>\nlet&#39;s say it is gymnastics. The child jumps and hops and learns to do  <br/>\ngreat forward and backward rolls and cartwheels and round-offs and  <br/>\nhand-stands and climbs like a monkey and so on. Obviously REALLY  <br/>\nenjoys the physical activity and demonstrates some level of talent.  <br/>\nPeople say to the parent, &quot;You should get him/her into gymnastics.&quot;  <br/>\nMom asks child, &quot;Hey, want to go sign up for gymnastics?&quot; They go  <br/>\nhave a look at the apparatus looks heavenly to the child - huge  <br/>\ntrampolines, bars to swing from, and on and on. Wow! So the kid signs  <br/>\nup, has talent, learns and moves up. Pretty soon there is pressure to  <br/>\ncome to practices more and more often, more and more hours are  <br/>\nexpected. The sessions become less and less fun and more and more  <br/>\nlike work. The child eventually just totally quits and never does any  <br/>\ngymnastics again. This is the USUAL situation for young people who  <br/>\nare extremely proficient in a sport, by the way. Most do not continue  <br/>\nenjoying it into adulthood, it becomes associated with work and  <br/>\nworry, not with fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould have been better if Mom would have responded by saying, &quot;Yeah,  <br/>\nhe is really enjoying gymnastics right now, in his own way.&quot; And let  <br/>\nit go, for then, rather than thinking the kid needed to get into some  <br/>\nmore formal gymnastics program.  I mean, unless the parent has goals  <br/>\nfor the child to compete at some high level, then it would be better  <br/>\nto just notice the child IS doing gymnastics and enjoying it. Why  <br/>\ninterfere with that?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - we&#39;re talking about some very young children who are really into  <br/>\nmusic, not a parent pushing a child into competitive sports, right  <br/>\n&lt;G&gt;? I know, there is a big difference. But there is still a warning  <br/>\nthere. I&#39;ve seen the exact same thing happen with youth theater and  <br/>\nwith musical instruments. So, your concern is well founded, imo.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might ask yourself whether or not they need anything more right  <br/>\nnow than access to musical instruments, exposure to lots of music,  <br/>\nmaybe access to some musically-inclined friends to show them a few  <br/>\nthings once in a while. Maybe, if they are very interested, they&#39;d  <br/>\nlike some low-key and relatively casual ongoing lessons from someone  <br/>\nwho will have fun with them. I&#39;m just worried that the purchase of  <br/>\nsome kind of program to follow will make it seem, to them, like what  <br/>\nthey were doing wasn&#39;t worthwhile. It would be totally okay for them  <br/>\nto &quot;just&quot; play around on the piano for years, if that was fun for  <br/>\nthem, right? Just keep in mind that if they ARE playing the piano and  <br/>\nare happy with how things are going, you could mess that up for them  <br/>\nby acting like it isn&#39;t good enough without some kind of instruction  <br/>\n(no matter how cool the method seems). So - that&#39;s the warning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam sorooshian<br/>\n<br/>\nRelay for Life<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.acsevents.org/relay/ca/longbeach/pamsoroosh\">http://www.acsevents.org/relay/ca/longbeach/pamsoroosh</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":116488337,"authorName":"Gold Standard","from":"&quot;Gold Standard&quot; &lt;jacki@...&gt;","profile":"jackiknouse","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Simply Music - piano lessons","postDate":"1175831632","msgId":28380,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHR0VCTUZPQUIuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGV2NDY2dStuZ20wQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":28379,"nextInTopic":28381,"prevInTime":28379,"nextInTime":28381,"topicId":28376,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We&#39;ve had several of<br/>\nthose  kids keyboards around the house for years and they are always<br/>\nplaying on them.  They&#39;ve given concerts for us and friends, using their<br/>\nkeyboards and kids megaphones that goes with one of the keyboards.

Yes, my kids definately have<br/>\nshown interest in wanting to play!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, my 8 year old really enjoyed learning to play the guitar from a<br/>\ncollege student when she was just turning 5, for about 4 months.  She<br/>\nactually was  reading music and playing several songs.  She even asked<br/>\nif she could give a Thanksgiving recital for all my family when she was<br/>\n5.  Unfortuanately, the college student left, after only 4 months with<br/>\nmy daughter.

What is their interest? Do they feel  <br/>\nthe same way? Have they already shown an interest in piano by picking  <br/>\nout lots of songs for themselves, asking people who do play to show  <br/>\nthem how to play simple songs, etc? Whose idea IS it that they should  <br/>\nlearn to play the piano?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;method&quot; isn&#39;t as important as whether or not you are providing  <br/>\nthe resources for supporting their interests versus you choosing what  <br/>\nand how they ought to learn something. This particular program sounds  <br/>\ncool, but it may or may not interest them - only spend money on it if  <br/>\nyou&#39;re willing for them to not be interested. I have bought things  <br/>\nlike that and had them available just because I had a feeling that it  <br/>\nmight be of interest at some time. I loved it when that happened - I  <br/>\ncould pull something off a shelf and it would be just the right  <br/>\nthing. But, building up an inventory of &quot;cool stuff&quot; means I also  <br/>\nspent money on things that were never used.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my family, two of my three girls did show a lot of interest in  <br/>\npiano - they played on the piano a lot and they picked out lots of  <br/>\nsongs and they got other people to show them songs. So I got simple  <br/>\npiano books and left them on the piano for them and answered a few  <br/>\nsimple questions about reading music. I got a keyboard - full size  <br/>\nwith realistic key action and lots of fun sounds/percussion, etc., to  <br/>\nplay with. They played around with it a lot, over years. Then one of  <br/>\nthem asked for lessons and I arranged that, for a while, until she  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to go anymore. She didn&#39;t stop playing the piano, just  <br/>\ntired of the lessons after just a few sessions (I think she&#39;d learned  <br/>\nenough to want to do it on her own again). She played on her own for  <br/>\nseveral more years, picking out songs, building her skills. Two of my  <br/>\nthree daughters took some piano lessons again in their mid/late  <br/>\nteens, at the community college. Roxana is in an intermediate piano  <br/>\nclass now and plans to continue.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\nRelay for Life<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.acsevents.org/relay/ca/longbeach/pamsoroosh\">http://www.acsevents.org/relay/ca/longbeach/pamsoroosh</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":283374811,"authorName":"Carol","from":"&quot;Carol&quot; &lt;carolfhs79@...&gt;","profile":"carolfhs79","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Simply Music - piano lessons","postDate":"1175785257","msgId":28376,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGV2MzJ2OStsNDdnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":28377,"prevInTime":28375,"nextInTime":28377,"topicId":28376,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Has anyone ever used the Simply Music tapes/CD  to learn how to play the piano?

And does anyone have these and want to sell them?<br/>\n<br/>\nI just learned of this method from another homeshooling mom.  It sounds<br/>\nlike a perfect fit into our unschooling method, of allowing children to<br/>\nlearn to play, simply for the fun of playing!  It is based on the<br/>\npremiss that everyone has a natural sense of music, from the rhythmic<br/>\nway we walk and talk to our heartbeat, breathing etc.....<br/>\n<br/>\nAccordingly, with this approach, kids immediatlry learn to play songs<br/>\nthrough immitation, instead of the boring traditional method  of first<br/>\nlearning to read music.  In the introductory video, they described their<br/>\nmethod,  with how kids learn to talk - by first hearing and listening<br/>\nthen immitating what they hear.
