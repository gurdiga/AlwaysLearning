I am lucky that it seems <br/>\nJayn rarely needs defending. But I am going to have to step out of my timid <br/>\ncomfort zone if I am ever to have more friends for myself and offer Jayn a <br/>\nwider circle. I am going to have to find a way to get past shyness. I need <br/>\nto connect proactively with the other parents I meet at such places as Jayn&#39;s <br/>\nnew ballet class, and at the future interests that she chooses, so that I <br/>\ncan facilitate the practical aspects of meeting up with her new friends. One <br/>\nadjustment I can make is to lower my expectations from seeking more <br/>\nsoulmates to seeking pleasant acquaintances, and Trust that the deeper <br/>\ndesire will be manifested by the Universe.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote that a year ago. She doesn&#39;t go to ballet any more. If anything she <br/>\nrelies even more strongly on our less than ideal neighbors.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt; If my children&#39;s boundaries should<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; be respected, why shouldn&#39;t mine be?  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wanted to address something inspired by this last sentence above.<br/>\n<br/>\nRespecting your own children&#39;s boundaries is something that you can control <br/>\nby your own actions and make the choice to enact. However holding on to an <br/>\nexpectation about what other people will do is tying your happiness or <br/>\ncomfort to the actions of others. This is not something that you can <br/>\ncontrol.<br/>\n<br/>\nYoung children, are always going to put their own needs before their <br/>\nparents&#39; - even if they are able to perceive them. Empathy comes eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have noticed how much energy unschooling parents are willing to put into <br/>\ntheir kid&#39;s joy. One thing we do is devise unusual strategies to help us <br/>\nthrough those comfort zone stretch times.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example with me, just as I used to take a book everywhere when I was a <br/>\nchild, now I take a bit of crafting along - usually some beading on my <br/>\nlatest doll, or some plastic bag crochet. This gives other people a <br/>\nconversational opening, and it gives me something to focus on instead of my <br/>\nown fears and shyness. However unlike a book or magazine, I am still able to <br/>\ntalk to people at the same time. Plus kids are usually interested too. If <br/>\nno-one wants to talk to me, I don&#39;t feel or look anxious about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother is that I make use of technology. Using email to talk about a recent <br/>\nproblem is much less confronting than face to face sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Jayn&#39;s comfort zone, I don&#39;t ever push her out of it. Her personality <br/>\nwon&#39;t stand for it. I comfort her with hugs and cuddles. Later I talk to her <br/>\nabout some place where she is stuck, and suggest alternatives she could be <br/>\ndoing. She vehemently refuses, and I stop and remind her that it is her <br/>\nchoice. Then I stay silent for a brief period. She may continue to say &quot;no&quot; <br/>\nor be silent herself. Then some undefinable time, usually shortly, <br/>\nthereafter she enacts my suggestion. Her bluster and denial are her ways of <br/>\npushing herself through that comfort barrier.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I use bluster and refusal in the same way in my self talk.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Even adults who are desperate to make new friends find it  <br/>\ndifficult until they stop trying to make friends and start focusing  <br/>\non finding activities they enjoy. Probably because they project an  <br/>\naura. When they&#39;re looking for friends they probably feel desperate  <br/>\nand it keeps people away. When they&#39;re focused on having fun, they  <br/>\nproject a more relaxed, fun aura.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My son Jeffrey<br/>\n&gt; (12) doesn&#39;t like being around a bunch of people, or trying new<br/>\n&gt; things. Unschoolers have told me that respecting his personally set<br/>\n&gt; boundaries is important.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is he comfortable staying home by himself?<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone recently mentioned, maybe on another list, that she has set  <br/>\ndays for out of the house and set days for in home and makes sure she  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t do any errands on home days. If it&#39;s not dependable and seems  <br/>\nrandom when out and home happen, the kids can have totally different  <br/>\nperceptions of how much of each is happening. So the stay at home kid  <br/>\nwill feel like you&#39;re always out and the going out kid will feel like  <br/>\nyou&#39;re always at home.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How do I find that fine line between respecting my children&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; boundaries and helping them step out of their comfort zone?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Whose comfort zone? Your son&#39;s so your daughter can be more social?  <br/>\nIf he doesn&#39;t want to be more social then you aren&#39;t helping him,  <br/>\nyou&#39;re pushing him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone also mentioned that they bring lots of solitary stuff for  <br/>\ntheir stay at home kid for him to do while he waits for his sibling <br/>\n(s) to be done, make sort of like a nest for him away from home. Make  <br/>\nhim helping her get out be as easy for him as possible. And make her  <br/>\nhelping him be at home as easy for her as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I feel<br/>\n&gt; like I&#39;m being told to be different than I am because I&#39;m an adult.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, the suggestion is that if you want to hold onto your nonsocial  <br/>\nways you&#39;ll get in the way of helping your daughter be with people  <br/>\nmore. When there are several goals, eventually one goal will get in  <br/>\nthe way of another and you have to choose.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince you chose to have children rather than remain childless, that  <br/>\nmeans you chose all that goes with having children, even being out in  <br/>\nsociety with social kids when you&#39;d rather be home.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s not easy for me at all to do things that make me feel<br/>\n&gt; uncomfortable. I&#39;ve never been pushed to do uncomfortable things<br/>\n&gt; until my adult/parenting years. If my children&#39;s boundaries should<br/>\n&gt; be respected, why shouldn&#39;t mine be?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Your daughter isn&#39;t disrespecting your boundaries by being social.  <br/>\nShe has a need that&#39;s not being met. She didn&#39;t choose to be social  <br/>\nto irk you. You may not be directly thinking that, but the idea may  <br/>\nbe half formed in the back of your mind even if you know it&#39;s not true.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince you&#39;ve had way more years on the planet, since you chose to  <br/>\ninvite the kids into your lives, it&#39;s part of the whole package deal  <br/>\nto find ways to meet your needs without taking from your kids. They  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t sign up to be supporters of your needs. The glorious thing,  <br/>\nthough, is that the more we take their needs seriously and work hard  <br/>\nat finding ways to meet them, the more they&#39;re willing to accommodate  <br/>\nus when they&#39;re able.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":213505820,"authorName":"Jennifer Varela","from":"&quot;Jennifer Varela&quot; &lt;gemini7772@...&gt;","profile":"gemini7772","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Social Life, Patience and Unschooling","postDate":"1221059759","msgId":38101,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFmYTNlNzYxMDgwOTEwMDgxNWo3ZmQxMTEwZnk5YTg0OWJhNWFiMzA1ZjcwQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PENFOTk1QUYyLUMzMTUtNDU0Ny04QTBFLUVBMjNDNDVFNjU5MUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDQ3NzE3Ni4xNzc4NC5xbUB3ZWI1ODYxMi5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+CSA8MWZhM2U3NjEwODA5MTAwNzAwbTU5Y2JmMDNlbDNmNjNlYjIxNTc4YzIwZjNAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+CSA8Q0U5OTVBRjItQzMxNS00NTQ3LThBMEUtRUEyM0M0NUU2NTkxQHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38100,"nextInTopic":38105,"prevInTime":38100,"nextInTime":38102,"topicId":38063,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

What do you, as <br/>\nan unschooling parent, do to help your child leave their comfort zone <br/>\nto be more social?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve posted before about my dd10 wanting to be more social.  I was <br/>\ntold I needed to step out of my comfort zone and learn to be more <br/>\nsocial so my children would have more opportunities to be social.  I <br/>\nfeel like I&#39;ve done a great deal to find social opportunities and <br/>\nnone of them have worked out.  I truly do want to give up entirely <br/>\nbut I don&#39;t share that sentiment with my children.  My son Jeffrey <br/>\n(12) doesn&#39;t like being around a bunch of people, or trying new <br/>\nthings.  Unschoolers have told me that respecting his personally set <br/>\nboundaries is important.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHow do I find that fine line between respecting my children&#39;s <br/>\nboundaries and helping them step out of their comfort zone?  I feel <br/>\nlike I&#39;m being told to be different than I am because I&#39;m an adult.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s not easy for me at all to do things that make me feel <br/>\nuncomfortable.  I&#39;ve never been pushed to do uncomfortable things <br/>\nuntil my adult/parenting years.  If my children&#39;s boundaries should <br/>\nbe respected, why shouldn&#39;t mine be?  <br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":337544642,"authorName":"carnationsgalore","from":"&quot;carnationsgalore&quot; &lt;addled.homemaker@...&gt;","profile":"carnationsgalore","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Social Life, Patience and Unschooling","postDate":"1221051293","msgId":38092,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdhOGcydCtkMWZoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ3NzE3Ni4xNzc4NC5xbUB3ZWI1ODYxMi5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":38091,"nextInTopic":38093,"prevInTime":38091,"nextInTime":38093,"topicId":38063,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I&#39;ve personally encountered groups who only like to hang out <br/>\nwith families that use the same curriculum.  At events, the very <br/>\nfirst question I&#39;d hear was about curriculum.  If I answered <br/>\nincorrectly, they would literally say &#39;oh&#39; and walk away.  I was <br/>\ndumbfounded!<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there were the homeschooling groups that had a mix of people.  <br/>\nWhile the kids played in the park, the moms sat together at a table <br/>\nand compared notes on curriculum and behavior.  I made the homeschool <br/>\nchoices (curriculum) I did because of a desire to fit in.  When I&#39;d <br/>\ncall us unschoolers, I got lots of negative feedback.  The nicest <br/>\nthing someone said to me about unschooling was that it was great I <br/>\nwas doing it with my young kids and how much she (the talker) had <br/>\nenjoyed unschooling until they finally reached the age <br/>\nwhere &quot;learning really matters&quot;.  Huh?  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I finally met another unschooling family, I was actually giddy.  <br/>\nIt was so nice to talk with another person without talk of <br/>\ncurriculum, behaviors, coercion methods and preparing for the <br/>\nfuture.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Social Life, Patience and Unschooling","postDate":"1221048849","msgId":38091,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgwOTEwMDUxNHMyN2I1N2MxMm1mZWUwZmI0NzMyZjgyOGEzQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDlFMjE2RjI1LTY4RTQtNDQ2Qi05QTEwLUE3RTY4MUMwNTg5Q0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgwOTA5MTEyOG1iODgwZDk2cDgwZTM1ZTA4NTUzZDRhZjVAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+CSA8OUUyMTZGMjUtNjhFNC00NDZCLTlBMTAtQTdFNjgxQzA1ODlDQHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38090,"nextInTopic":38092,"prevInTime":38090,"nextInTime":38092,"topicId":38063,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It *is* possible for people to<br/>\nchange, or become more like minded with others, to grow in more or less<br/>\neven/uneven patterns with their friends (past and present).  It&#39;s also<br/>\npossible for people lives to become more fleshed out for others, and we can<br/>\nlearn cool things about them we didn&#39;t know before hanging out with them.<br/>\nWe can&#39;t know any of that if we don&#39;t spend enough time to find it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe people get so careful or busy or whatever that very little happens to<br/>\nthem socially, and this can have a larger effect in a small group or type of<br/>\nhomeschoolers like unschoolers are.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo of course unschoolers limit themselves severely when they seek out<br/>\nunschoolers only for a social life.  And because unschooling takes on<br/>\nsomething very like religious fervor --since it *is* about our dear sweet<br/>\nchildren-- the word unschooler means different things to different people.<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s also part of the social dilemma of finding like minded folks to<br/>\nhang out with.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut all that isn&#39;t automatically part of an unschooler&#39;s social dilemma.<br/>\nJust as we&#39;re learning to be more aware in our relationship with our<br/>\nchildren, we can become more aware in relationships to others in the wider<br/>\nworld.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor some people this isn&#39;t anything to think about because they&#39;ve been<br/>\nkeenly aware socially before they even got to the point of unschooling their<br/>\nchildren.  For others, like me, it *is* something to think about.<br/>\nEspecially in the context of unschooling which can be seen by so many as<br/>\nsocially unacceptable if it&#39;s bluntly or ineffectively presented.
