Breanna is <br/>\nmy number two, she&#39;s the one with autism. The younger children are all (relatively) normal, <br/>\nbut as we say, what is normal anyway ;-) LOL!  I actually have more trouble with the typical <br/>\nkids than my auties, auties are very straightforward with their needs, my younger kids are <br/>\nmore needy and complex. I&#39;ve had to learn alot since having them, esp the boys (4 and 2 <br/>\nyo). <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For a long time we didn&#39;t see Alex&#39; tendancies towards<br/>\n&gt; autism spectrum difficulties because he&#39;s so very<br/>\n&gt; different from Thomas and he&#39;s much more functional<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>YES! Ours are so completely different. Bre was dx&#39;d first, when she turned two, and Josh <br/>\nwas dx&#39;d three years later. I would say long run Bre will be more intense for us, but Josh <br/>\nhas been a puzzle for a while. I&#39;ve always loved the person he is, but the schools only <br/>\nappreciate him for his high test scores. They both have sensory integration dysfunction, <br/>\nbut Bre&#39;s manifests as hyperactive disorder, high pain tolerance, remarkable balance, and <br/>\nlack of fear. Josh is the opposite in every way, and it still amazes me that they both have <br/>\nDSI but are so completely different. Josh is very laid back, likes to read and play games, <br/>\nhas been fearful of new things since toddling, is extremely sensitive to pain and emotion, <br/>\nand can&#39;t stand straight without falling over. Seriously, once at the mall, I was amazed to <br/>\nsee him stand still, and his feet flew right out from underneath him. If you didn&#39;t know him <br/>\nyou&#39;d think he was faking for attention.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The three adults in our home are also somewhere on the<br/>\n&gt; spectrum or shadow border of autism, including myself.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My husband and I are both spectrumy. strong interests, my hubby is very shy, and I am in <br/>\nlarge situations. My dad is very aspie, and so is my BIL, although neither have been dx&#39;d. I <br/>\nhave sensory issues out the wazoo, and totally relate to all my kids&#39; issues with noise. I <br/>\nthought everyone could hear light bulbs hum until the psych told me that&#39;s what was <br/>\ncausing Breanna&#39;s meltdowns at school! I would say that there was definately a strong <br/>\ncomponent, however, there must have been a trigger to cause a stronger dysfunction in <br/>\nour oldest two, but not in the younger ones.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I feel that the difference between what constitutes a<br/>\n&gt; difference and what is a dysfunction often boils down<br/>\n&gt; to point of view <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I like that. I have a tendency to describe Josh&#39;s difference as just that, because he hides his <br/>\nproblems better. One thing that has led me to keeping my kids out of the system and at <br/>\nhome is the fact that labelling them seems to drag them down. And they don&#39;t need that. <br/>\nSchools want to categorize the kids for simplicity, and I was seeing Bre suffer for it as well. <br/>\nEVERY child is capable of learning, and the schools will not attempt to help those who are <br/>\nmore disabled. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s been really hard for me, as an unschooler, to<br/>\n&gt; find the balance between what my beliefs and<br/>\n&gt; principles tell me about parenting and about<br/>\n&gt; unschooling, and what my children actually need.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>yes! Where do you draw the line between trying to teach a child with a disability and <br/>\nrespecting their needs to learn on their own, express themselves, and do what they need <br/>\nto do...for example, how long do we let Breanna rock? It&#39;s so touchy! Obviously she started <br/>\nfor a reason, self-soothing, but there comes a point where it must stop before she injures <br/>\nherself or because she cannot eat. She needs to express herself, but not by scaring other <br/>\npeople. She gets frustrated, but she&#39;s not allowed to take it out on other people.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; These are not &quot;retarded&quot; or mentally deficient kids. <br/>\n&gt; They are bright, have been called &quot;gifted&quot;, have a wry<br/>\n&gt; and surprising (as in unusual) sense of humor, have<br/>\n&gt; talents and skills. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yep, even my nonverbal daughter has a high IQ (if you&#39;re into those things), both are very <br/>\nintelligent, I&#39;ll be Josh is alot like Thomas, he spoke very early and like &#39;a little professor&#39;. I <br/>\nmust say I thought I was an excellent parent, he was the best mannered child, so insightful <br/>\nand calm. LOL! It&#39;s all personality, and very little me.

I would love to do this.  My <br/>\ninclination is to do this in fact.  I have to fight with myself to <br/>\nget to that level of involvement that my boys need, which is more <br/>\nthan a casual suggestion, a sincere serious request, or a heartfelt <br/>\nplea even.  That works sometimes, but often is just not adequate.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance Thomas loves the cats.  He loves them to their <br/>\ndistress.  They cry and squirm and are in pain or frightened and he <br/>\nrefuses to put them down.  He has been constantly scratched up for <br/>\nyears now, always bearing marks of loving the cats too hard.  It <br/>\nhurts and he bleeds and cries, but it&#39;s little to no deterrent.  <br/>\nThey run from him when they see him often.  We can ask, beg, and <br/>\ncommand him to put a cat down or let it go, but it boils down to us <br/>\nhaving to physically remove the cat from his arms.  He feels bad <br/>\nabout it, and says &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I just can&#39;t help it.  I try and try <br/>\nbut...&quot;  He asks us to help him stop himself.  So we stop him from <br/>\npicking up the cats, he&#39;s just not allowed to.  He can love them as <br/>\nlong as they are willing to be stationary for him to do so wherever <br/>\nthey are.  That&#39;s just one example.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;None of us would normally spring a plan on the others, or knowingly <br/>\n&gt;withhold information about a need or appointment.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Right, of course, that&#39;s just common courtesy with people you live <br/>\nwith, particularly in a close family.  We certainly do that too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut imagine someone calls one of you, kids or adults, and <br/>\nsays, &quot;Hey, we&#39;re having a birthday party for your good friend five <br/>\nhours from now!  We forgot to let you know that we changed the day.  <br/>\nWe&#39;re really sorry!  Hope you can make it!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would be their reaction?  I imagine, surprise, excitement, <br/>\nmaybe some irritation at the last minute notice, some rushing to get <br/>\nready maybe?  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen this happened to Thomas, he flat refused to go.  He screamed <br/>\nfor an hour.  He was extremely unhappy for two or three more hours, <br/>\ntense and stressed and doing self soothing behaviors.  Then in the <br/>\nlast hour or so, he began to adjust to the idea, began to accept the <br/>\npossibility of going, then began to get excited about going.  We <br/>\nwere a little late, but he finally was able to go and enjoy himself, <br/>\nin his way.   Of course that entire time before the party we were <br/>\nhugely involved in trying to talk him through and get him to a point <br/>\nwhere he could go.  We were totally exhausted by the time we <br/>\narrived, but he did get to go!  If he had been too upset to go, he <br/>\nwould have been angry and upset with himself about it for weeks <br/>\nafterwards.<br/>\n<br/>\nAutistics just don&#39;t *do* flexibility, at least not easily.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  We&#39;re aware when one of the others seems frustrated, or hungry, <br/>\n&gt;or is getting sick. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There&#39;s another big difference for us.  Often with autistics they <br/>\nare *not* aware of the needs, thoughts or feelings of those around <br/>\nthem, even when they seem obvious and clear to anyone else.  They <br/>\ndon&#39;t often consider how their actions affect others and even when <br/>\nthey are told, they often don&#39;t *get* it.  They can&#39;t see it and <br/>\ndon&#39;t understand how to address it if they do see it.

My sons<br/>\nThomas and Alex are both developmentally different,<br/>\nThomas has Aspergers Syndrome, (High Functioning<br/>\nAutism) among other related differences or<br/>\ndysfunctions, and Alex is somewhere on the autism<br/>\nspectrum as well.  We don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to<br/>\nhave kids who are not like this, who are &quot;normal.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a long time we didn&#39;t see Alex&#39; tendancies towards<br/>\nautism spectrum difficulties because he&#39;s so very<br/>\ndifferent from Thomas and he&#39;s much more functional or<br/>\nless adversely affected in a number of ways than<br/>\nThomas is.  Thomas, being older, set our definitions<br/>\nfor autism as being the things he does, and that made<br/>\nit harder for us to see it in Alex.  However the<br/>\nreason autism is described as a spectrum and<br/>\nsymbolized with a multicolored puzzle image, is due to<br/>\nit&#39;s huge range of symptoms and modes of presentation<br/>\nand it&#39;s many unknown and mysterious qualities.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAutism is really hard to get a diagnosis for usually,<br/>\nparticularly high functioning autism, and the kids<br/>\nusually run through scads of labels (particularly if<br/>\nthey are in school) to explain their behavioral issues<br/>\nand other problems and challenges (labels like ADHD,<br/>\nlearning disabilities, mood disorders, bi-polar,<br/>\nsensory integration dysfunction and so on) before they<br/>\nfinally hit on autism.  Often they do have those or<br/>\nother things going on too (common comorbid diagnosis)<br/>\nthat run in that developmental area, further clouding<br/>\nand confusing things.  Thomas sure does.  many times<br/>\ndiagnostic difficulties are just because we don&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand autism very well at all, and have very<br/>\nlittle idea what causes it (none at all officially<br/>\naccepted) or what &quot;it&quot; exacly is and does.  Medical<br/>\npeople are also afraid to diagnose it because it&#39;s a<br/>\nfearful word, one they are afraid of and one parents<br/>\nget viscerally angry for having applied to their<br/>\nchild.  They would rather say PDDNOS (Pervasive<br/>\nDevelopmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified) or<br/>\nsomething similarly ineffectual, which means very<br/>\nlittle and helps (as in making therapies and things<br/>\navailable, helping parents understand and parent their<br/>\nchild better and so on) not at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe three adults in our home are also somewhere on the<br/>\nspectrum or shadow border of autism, including myself.<br/>\n Obviously there are well known genetic components and<br/>\nit&#39;s common for mutliple generations back in an<br/>\nautistic&#39;s family to share myriad clues and tendancies<br/>\n(often just viewed as eccentricities) towards autism. <br/>\nIt&#39;s also common to have a much greater autism<br/>\npercentage in families with many members involved in<br/>\nmaths, arts and sciences, which describes my family<br/>\ncertainly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel that the difference between what constitutes a<br/>\ndifference and what is a dysfunction often boils down<br/>\nto point of view and comparisons to the most common<br/>\ndenominators.  Common doesn&#39;t always equate to normal<br/>\nas far as we&#39;re concerned.  Different doesn&#39;t always<br/>\nmean dysfunctional.  That&#39;s something I think most<br/>\nunscoolers can agree with pretty readily.  In some<br/>\nthings yes, there is true dysfunction that needs<br/>\naddressing, but other times there&#39;s just differently<br/>\nfunctioning, and that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been really hard for me, as an unschooler, to<br/>\nfind the balance between what my beliefs and<br/>\nprinciples tell me about parenting and about<br/>\nunschooling, and what my children actually need.  Tom<br/>\nand I have had to come to a hard and not desired<br/>\nconclusion that our kids do *need* us to set<br/>\nboundaries, and yes some rules, and to help them<br/>\nschedule and manage different things, more than a<br/>\n&quot;normal&quot; (unschooled or otherwise) child would.  They<br/>\nreally do need that kind of black and white pattern to<br/>\nfollow, because a world of greys is totally<br/>\noverwhelming for them and causes all sorts of bad<br/>\nthings to happen, in them and in our family.  We know,<br/>\nwe learned the hard way, being stubborn about wanting<br/>\nto unschool our kids, not set rules, not have bedtimes<br/>\nand such.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey often cannot recognize, let alone articulate how<br/>\nthey feel or what they need.  Although they are both<br/>\nshowing remarkable progress in that area, but are<br/>\nstill behind where most kids their age would be in<br/>\nthose abilities.  Recognizing and acting on the<br/>\nemotions and needs of others if hard too, and likely<br/>\nwill be all their lives.  Reading faces (angry, sad,<br/>\nworried) and body language is really hard for them. <br/>\nKnowing and then taking appropriate action under<br/>\nstress is really hard for them, and stress is always<br/>\none moment of frustration away, like flipping a switch<br/>\nfrom happy to raging.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve learned that our kids really do need to be woke<br/>\nup at a general certain time and helped to get to bed<br/>\nat a certain time, because they really, really *can&#39;t*<br/>\ndo that self regulation, and without a regular<br/>\nschedule for sleeping there is a cascading<br/>\ndeterioration in them in many ways.  They need<br/>\npatterns and routines and rituals for everything, and<br/>\nif we don&#39;t provide them they create their own,<br/>\nsometimes inappropriate ones, but other times fine. <br/>\nThey also deteriorate if they don&#39;t have a regular<br/>\npatterned schedule overall, both daily and weekly. <br/>\nThey need to know what&#39;s coming, plan for things, have<br/>\na sense of control.  Surprises, even good ones, are<br/>\nhoribly upsetting.  For instance they pick out their<br/>\nown gifts and help me wrap them because that&#39;s the<br/>\nonly way they are comfortable with recieving wrapped<br/>\ngifts.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey really do need for us to help redirect (often<br/>\nfirmly and with physical intervention) their conflicts<br/>\nand self soothing behaviors (tics, etc.) to prevent<br/>\nthings from getting out of hand, perseverating<br/>\nobsessivness, impulsive violence, etc.  We really do<br/>\nneed to manage their emotional outbursts as well,<br/>\nhaving to use physical restraint to prevent behavior<br/>\nthat is self injurious or injurious to others.  This<br/>\nis lessening as they get older thankfully!! but Thomas<br/>\nis 9 and I still have to do it a couple times a week<br/>\nat least.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe really do need to insist on certain clothing<br/>\nchoices appropriate to the weather or setting, because<br/>\nthey have a hard time learning from experience and<br/>\nhave sensory problems that can cause things like<br/>\nfrostbite and illness before they think they might<br/>\nneed to get warmer or drier or whatever, or a lack of<br/>\nsocial awareness or sensory or other problems that<br/>\nwill cause them to want to run barefoot in a food<br/>\nstore or restaurant, or walk around with their hands<br/>\nin their pants, self fondling as a toddler would, or<br/>\nremove their shirt, lick people or things, or<br/>\nwhatever.  We&#39;re a lot more relaxed about what&#39;s an<br/>\nacceptable choice or behavior than a lot of folks<br/>\nwe&#39;ve known, but we do have to have some parameters in<br/>\nthere and constant reminders.  Just asking them to<br/>\nconsider their actions and be respectful to others, or<br/>\ntreat them how they would want to be treated or<br/>\nsimilar parental admonissions is totally not enough<br/>\ninformation at all and open to far too much<br/>\ninterpretation, not to mention lapses in impulse<br/>\ncontrol.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are not &quot;retarded&quot; or mentally deficient kids. <br/>\nThey are bright, have been called &quot;gifted&quot;, have a wry<br/>\nand surprising (as in unusual) sense of humor, have<br/>\ntalents and skills.  They are extremely verbose and<br/>\narticulate (Thomas is hyperverbal) with large and well<br/>\ndeveloped vocabularies.  They play complex adult<br/>\ncomputer games and enjoy adult movies and books as<br/>\nwell as kids ones.  Thomas (9) wants to be a director<br/>\n(of movies) when he grows up and can wax long on movie<br/>\nplots, themes, character development, backstory<br/>\ndetails, and so on, that being his obsession of<br/>\nchoice.  He loves complicated multi-movie or<br/>\nmulti-book fantasy sagas.  Thomas is also a very<br/>\ngifted storyteller.  Alex (7) loves to dance and plays<br/>\nguitar and keyboard/piano, sings, switch hits with a<br/>\nbat and catches and pitches, can throw a frisbee,<br/>\ntumble, does huge puzzles, does multi-digit multi<br/>\nfunction math in his head faster than me.  He doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhave Thomas&#39; spatial or motor development problems. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey don&#39;t &quot;look&quot; any different than regular kids, and<br/>\nare in fact both really handsome. (really!  I&#39;m not<br/>\njust biased!  Their long thick eyelashes, Thomas huge<br/>\ngrey eyes and dimples and impish grin, Alex&#39; generous<br/>\nmouth and square jaw and dimpled chin...)  Often on<br/>\nshort or casual observation they don&#39;t seem to act any<br/>\ndifferent than typical kids either.  All this makes it<br/>\nharder not easier for ourselves, our families and<br/>\nothers to understand and see that they do have real<br/>\nchallenges, they are not just &quot;misbehaving&quot; and we&#39;re<br/>\nnot just some weird hovering overly involved parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry to be so long winded on this topic, but I<br/>\nreally felt like sharing the complexities that enter<br/>\ninto raising a child or children who have these types<br/>\nof differences while maintaining unschooling and<br/>\nattachment parenting principles.
