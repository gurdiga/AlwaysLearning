An hour or a day or a week of solitude. What was the  <br/>\nquality of your breath? The state of your mind? How did you get there?<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking about skipping this one but then decided to give my  <br/>\ntake on it. For me, the idea espoused here equates to internal  <br/>\nstillness. I know people who meditate. I think I understand the  <br/>\nconcept. The closest I come to that is when I&#39;m soaking in the bathtub/ <br/>\nshower, my mind floating among the quanta. Otherwise, my brain is  <br/>\nalways gnawing at something. Always. Except...<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, I frequently achieve a significant, mind-expanded inner  <br/>\nstillness during animated conversations among the four of us. Chloe,  <br/>\nMJ, Ronnie, and I will be engaged in a spirited discussion which will  <br/>\nthen mutate to the point where the three of them are embroiled in some  <br/>\nspecific concept, leaving me in a quiet conversational eddy. As I sit  <br/>\nand watch them attempt to unscrew the inscrutable, I find myself  <br/>\nslipping into an exceedingly peaceful state, my awareness open but  <br/>\nunengaged, not actively gnawing at anything, my needs nonexistent, my  <br/>\nwants nonexistent, the flow of time nonexistent. Ronnie, MJ, and Chloe  <br/>\nare intensely engaged, their minds integrating, synthesizing, their  <br/>\nbrilliant exchanges of energetic thought almost visible in their  <br/>\nintensity; but in those moments I feel that I am a stillness at the  <br/>\ncenter of things, the shanti of the East.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49116,"nextTopicId":49090}}
