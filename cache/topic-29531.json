I&#39;m still single (prefering <br/>\nit this way actually) and I&#39;ve started going to college but the kids <br/>\nare still in school and they would rather be home.  And I would <br/>\nrather they were home.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool hasn&#39;t been terrible for them.  They&#39;re strong kids.  But <br/>\nit&#39;s the little things that have developed that are breaking my <br/>\nheart like my always assertive daughter suddenly becoming shy and my <br/>\nson being in a school without an art program (Aiden without art is <br/>\nlike a fish without water).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point I&#39;m not working and while I will be going to school <br/>\nfull time for the next 4 years it&#39;s only for a few hours a day.
