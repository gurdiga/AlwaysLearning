In Jr. hi we had flour <br/>\nsack babies (Ok I wasn&#39;t actually in the class but thought it was a cool <br/>\nassignment so I did it with my friends who were in that class :) )  My <br/>\nboyfriend and I had two flour sack babies named Onyx and Obsidian.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother boyfriend and I had a &#39;plant baby&#39; (a jade plant that we <br/>\nco-parented) named Lucidity.  We treated her like a real baby (Ok, I was an <br/>\nodd kid I know).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn highschool I went with hippy/element names.  There was Oshen Rane (ocean <br/>\nrain -water baby) Aurora Sky Dawn (air baby), Ember Ashe (fire baby) And <br/>\nKanyon Terra (earth baby).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn college I really wanted a little blond baby girl named Lettuce.  People <br/>\nstill speak of Lettuce.  I still think it&#39;s a cool name.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy college boyfriend and I named our imaginary children Dharma (before the <br/>\nshow), Kellen Alisabeth, and the twins Zot and Zoe.  He was also a big Pink <br/>\nFloyd fan and Liked the name Pink.  As well as the lead singer guys name <br/>\n(which I can&#39;t remember).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo then I married my husband and he loved names like Agustus and Americanus. <br/>\n    He likes names from Roman Generals which didn&#39;t mesh so well with my <br/>\nearthy hippy far out names.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe ended up with Kathrynn and Aiden.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere I work we get some weird named kids...<br/>\n<br/>\nSilver and Orion are sister and brother.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs are Serenity and Winter.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also have a Harleigh (Harley, girl) and her brother Andrue (which is <br/>\nnormal I know but I had never seen it spelled that way)<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking up names with a friend the other day we came across the name Saran.  <br/>\nWhich is really pretty if it weren&#39;t for Saran Wrap!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in list format here they are...<br/>\n<br/>\nOnyx<br/>\nObsidian<br/>\nLucidity<br/>\nOshen Rane<br/>\nAurora Sky Dawn<br/>\nEmber Ashe<br/>\nKanyon Terra<br/>\nLettuce<br/>\nDharma<br/>\nZot<br/>\nZoe<br/>\nKellen<br/>\nSilver<br/>\nOrion<br/>\nWinter (or quads w/Summer, Autumn, and Spring :) )<br/>\nSerenity<br/>\nHarleigh<br/>\nAndrue<br/>\nSaran<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI once heard a story (urban legend?) about a foreign woman who came to <br/>\nAmerica and had a baby but didn&#39;t know English.
