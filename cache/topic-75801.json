Minecraft is a wonderful computer/tablet/consul game that many kids enjoy and your son would be able to play online with lots of other kids. There are also a myriad of other online games that your son could play with kids his age. I suggest joining the Yahoo group of unschooling gamers. Here is the link: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/unschooling_gamers/info\">https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/unschooling_gamers/info</a></div><div><br></div><div>I also suggest getting (if you don&#39;t already have it) Skype on your computer and letting your son Skype with other kids he connects with online.

I hope you can help me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a small vessel stroke on the left side of my brain in the thalamus gland 19 days ago on March 20.  It affected my right side.  I am getting better a little every day and we expect a full recovery.  I just turned 48 yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are unschooling our youngest, he is 7.5.  Our other children are grown (25, 24, 21) and are in other places except our daughter who is moving out again on May 1.  Levi went to Nursery School at the church I worked in when he was 4-5. That was half days 3 days a week... Otherwise he&#39;s always been with family, mostly me and his dad.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrior to the stroke we were definitely going through a cocooning stage.  Staying home, having lots of pajama days, watching cartoon, building legos and power rangers, reading books, video games, cuddling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also had some time when he had the crud and so did I, so there was recovery from that in the couple weeks before my stroke.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are home alone together again now.  I am walking without the walker, except for steps, although slow and awkward.  I am working to write my name, print (I love to write by hand so it&#39;s important to me) typing is slow and I make lots of corrections (pardon if I miss some).<br/>\nDaddy is exhausted right now between running our company alone, doing much to care for us, and the house. Bless him he&#39;s practically asleep as soon as he sits down at night.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is ready for the pace to pick up some. He is also transitioning from younger play to wanting more interesting things to do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if y&#39;all can offer some suggestions for us? My sensory perception was affected so I have to go slow and deliberate, no multi-tasking or lots of stimulation at once yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t go outside without another grown person yet, and driving is not an option.  There is not a budget for a helper or anything right now.  <br/>\nHe would enjoy playing online perhaps, but I want him to play in a safe children&#39;s environment. I don&#39;t know how to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this is a temporary situation, but I want to help us get through as peacefully as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75821,"nextTopicId":75834}}
