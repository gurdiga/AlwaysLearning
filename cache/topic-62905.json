Those precious gems have been obliterated by social conditioning, cultural environment, and fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nI should have clarified that when I refer to &#39;instinct&#39;, I&#39;m not talking about animal instinct, but maternal instinct.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery parent I&#39;ve known &#39;loses it&#39; at some time in their parenting, but it&#39;s not from being intuitive.  It&#39;s the opposite of intuitiveness.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut there is a moment of choice to listen to the heart.  Count to ten, take a walk, whatever....to gain one&#39;s composure enough to be able to reconnect to one&#39;s own heart, and reconnect with the god-given maternal instincts. No mother alive (except in extreme cases) who truly takes the time to reconnect would ever treat their child in such unskillful ways.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe vast majority of parents love their children and want no harm to come to them, especially from their own hands and mouths. <br/>\n<br/>\nGoing through my turbulent times, the struggles I went through, was because I love my child.  I learned to listen to my heart instead of trying to figure out which &#39;methods&#39; to use.  For instance, &#39;time-outs&#39; were once (not long ago, either) considered the most popular choice in disciplining children, but now (thankfully) is being accepted as a way of punishment instead of discipline.  I don&#39;t even like the word &#39;discipline&#39; because to me, it sounds like &#39;punishment&#39; wrapped up in a ribbon.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was raised in the south, and whoppins&#39; were the norm.  We were often required to find our own switch from a tree limb to be switched with, and if it wasn&#39;t the right size, we had to go get another one, which would inflict the most pain.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven as a child, I swore I would never treat my children that way.  I&#39;m sorry to say that (with 3 children....two are grown) I can count the number of spankings on both my hands, and occasionally yelled.  That many spankings (10) would be considered few by many, but for me, it was way too much.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best advice I ever got, was to excuse myself from the situation for the time being, saying something like &#39;I&#39;d rather talk about this later, in a few minutes, when we both can be more reasonable, is that okay with you&#39;?  It rarely failed, and gave me opportunity to reflect on what it is I really want to happen here.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kim Zerbe&quot; &lt;kim.zerbe@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-Mostly, the main point I wanted to make is that when we follow our<br/>\n&gt; instincts and intuition, we just can&#39;t go wrong.-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes we CAN go wrong! That is the sad thing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;When I was a social worker, I heard these words from many parents who<br/>\n&gt; had abused or neglected their children. I came to see the words, &quot;Well,<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s how I was raised and I turned out okay...&quot; as a huge red flag. It<br/>\n&gt; seems to be the last rationalization for a bad (or at least less than<br/>\n&gt; optimal) behavior by a parent.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have to agree. This struck a chord with me. For 7 years, since I became a<br/>\n&gt; mother, I have been fighting my &quot;natural instincts&quot; on how to treat my child<br/>\n&gt; because I believe in my heart that they are WRONG! When my son was very<br/>\n&gt; young and acting out, my natural instinct was to yell at him and if he<br/>\n&gt; continued, maybe to hit him or at least be rough with him. Anger came so<br/>\n&gt; easily to the surface for me. That&#39;s what I was taught by example. The one<br/>\n&gt; who yells the loudest gets their point across! No? The one who pushes<br/>\n&gt; someone into a corner is the winner, right? And when the loser cries, then<br/>\n&gt; you get to make fun of them for being weak. Wait, that&#39;s not how all parents<br/>\n&gt; treat their kids? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No kidding! It shouldn&#39;t be! But when you grow up this way, it&#39;s really hard<br/>\n&gt; to know what is the best way to treat kids. Even if your heart says don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; hit your kids, when that kid is really pushing your buttons and you are on<br/>\n&gt; the edge of blowing up, and all you have in your toolbox is Yell, Push, Hit,<br/>\n&gt; Be the Boss, what do you do??<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I read a TON, looking for answers, help, new ideas, anything. I needed new<br/>\n&gt; tools no one in my family had used on me! I was desperate! I had vowed to<br/>\n&gt; myself that I would NOT hit my child. Now I can walk away, count, take deep<br/>\n&gt; breaths. I am a lot calmer than I was 5 years ago and even 10 years ago.<br/>\n&gt; Sometimes I just say one word. &quot;Towel&quot; might mean &quot;please pick up your wet<br/>\n&gt; towel and hang it in the bathroom.&quot; (I can also say the latter, instead of<br/>\n&gt; yelling and swearing!) <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I read something on Sandra&#39;s site about choices (first choosing the lesser<br/>\n&gt; of 2 evils and eventually replacing the evils with kinder things) and when I<br/>\n&gt; had the urge to become violent, I would yell (mentally forcing my arm to<br/>\n&gt; stay still!). Then after a while instead of yelling I could take a deep<br/>\n&gt; breath. And with that breath I have the chance to look at my son and think<br/>\n&gt; he doesn&#39;t deserve to be hit OR yelled at. He is so lucky he can grow up<br/>\n&gt; differently. I hope that he doesn&#39;t remember all the yelling so much as all<br/>\n&gt; the hugging and listening.

That is the sad thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;When I was a social worker, I heard these words from many parents who<br/>\nhad abused or neglected their children. I came to see the words, &quot;Well,<br/>\nthat&#39;s how I was raised and I turned out okay...&quot; as a huge red flag. It<br/>\nseems to be the last rationalization for a bad (or at least less than<br/>\noptimal) behavior by a parent.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI have to agree. This struck a chord with me. For 7 years, since I became a<br/>\nmother, I have been fighting my &quot;natural instincts&quot; on how to treat my child<br/>\nbecause I believe in my heart that they are WRONG! When my son was very<br/>\nyoung and acting out, my natural instinct was to yell at him and if he<br/>\ncontinued, maybe to hit him or at least be rough with him. Anger came so<br/>\neasily to the surface for me. That&#39;s what I was taught by example. The one<br/>\nwho yells the loudest gets their point across! No? The one who pushes<br/>\nsomeone into a corner is the winner, right? And when the loser cries, then<br/>\nyou get to make fun of them for being weak. Wait, that&#39;s not how all parents<br/>\ntreat their kids? <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNo kidding! It shouldn&#39;t be! But when you grow up this way, it&#39;s really hard<br/>\nto know what is the best way to treat kids. Even if your heart says don&#39;t<br/>\nhit your kids, when that kid is really pushing your buttons and you are on<br/>\nthe edge of blowing up, and all you have in your toolbox is Yell, Push, Hit,<br/>\nBe the Boss, what do you do??<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI read a TON, looking for answers, help, new ideas, anything. I needed new<br/>\ntools no one in my family had used on me! I was desperate! I had vowed to<br/>\nmyself that I would NOT hit my child. Now I can walk away, count, take deep<br/>\nbreaths. I am a lot calmer than I was 5 years ago and even 10 years ago.<br/>\nSometimes I just say one word. &quot;Towel&quot; might mean &quot;please pick up your wet<br/>\ntowel and hang it in the bathroom.&quot; (I can also say the latter, instead of<br/>\nyelling and swearing!) <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI read something on Sandra&#39;s site about choices (first choosing the lesser<br/>\nof 2 evils and eventually replacing the evils with kinder things) and when I<br/>\nhad the urge to become violent, I would yell (mentally forcing my arm to<br/>\nstay still!). Then after a while instead of yelling I could take a deep<br/>\nbreath. And with that breath I have the chance to look at my son and think<br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t deserve to be hit OR yelled at. He is so lucky he can grow up<br/>\ndifferently. I hope that he doesn&#39;t remember all the yelling so much as all<br/>\nthe hugging and listening.

I love the emphasis on the examined life I see here.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy own journey toward radical unschooling has been rocky to say the least.  Can&#39;t even count the internal battles I went through in order to find myself, find my own path, and respond to my family accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son was opposed to being &#39;taught&#39; anything at all.  I was so inclined to &#39;make him learn&#39;.  Wow, that was a mistake!  However gentle my approach, he always &#39;smelled a rat&#39;!  My main concern was his reading....rather NOT reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is a very &#39;spirited&#39; child, and I knew he would not make it in public school.  As I wrestled through my internal demons, I was blessed to have found a democratic school in our area.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, he didn&#39;t request any &#39;teaching&#39; of any sort.  He just played all day at school.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he was 12 years old, I took him out of school.  I&#39;d try again.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBy that time, I had pretty much abandoned all hope that he would ever let anyone teach him anything.  But this was a very crucial time in our lives, and during the process, I released him....I threw out any &#39;rule books&#39;, didn&#39;t count so much on the great writers of the unschooling movement to tell me how to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI began relying completely on my intuition, instincts, and spirituality to lead me in the right path, and discovered that this was what I believed in all along, but fear of &#39;what THEY would think&#39;, &#39;could I get in trouble&#39;, &#39;am I neglecting my son&#39;, and all those haunting questions and worries had kept me from following my own instincts. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe more I released my worries and replaced them with trust and faith in my son, and my own heart, our journey began to flourish.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 15, he has taught himself to read (behind my back...lol) and has become very knowledgeable in so many areas of his interests....science and history especially, but many other interests as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost importantly, our relationship has flourished.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has chosen to return to the democratic school one day a week, in order to increase his social life, and participate in new things, and learn new things....not only willingly, but he&#39;s excited about learning now.
