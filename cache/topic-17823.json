Ok, all kidding aside, black folk&#39;s hair <br/>\ndoes not need to be washed as often as white folk hair.  2-3 weeks is <br/>\nfine, unless it&#39;s down, then you wash it to help the combing process, <br/>\nwhich really sucks. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   7..

I have determined I&#39;m a bath magnet. All I must <br/>\ndo is pour a glass of wine, grab my favorite book, and run hot water <br/>\nwith Lavender, and before i know it I have naked children in the tub <br/>\nwith me and the book is on the toilet seat.  I no longer can bath with <br/>\nboth of them at the same time, as I used to do.  This really helps when <br/>\nJanene is overloaded and crying.  That is ultimately what i did last <br/>\nnight, she had her Cats show (where she danced to the music to an <br/>\naudience of mom) and then something happened and she had a breakdown and <br/>\nI held her for a while but she cried and cried, so finally we took a <br/>\nbath and within 2 minutes she was calm.
