There are occasionally things <br/>\nthat they see advertised that appeal to them, and last night, watching <br/>\nLizzie McGuire, Linnaea wanted me to brush her hair. But, on the whole they <br/>\naren&#39;t that vulnerable. Probably much less to do with television and much <br/>\nmore to do with themselves. If I view the television and its advertising as <br/>\npredatory, surely it is much better if I help my children, the prey items, <br/>\nto be stronger in themselves and less likely to be easy prey then if I only <br/>\ndelay their association with television until they are no longer under my <br/>\n&quot;watchful eye&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that there are ways that people can be vulnerable to the influences <br/>\nof others. But I don&#39;t believe that by opening the world up and exploring <br/>\nits rich wonderfulness and supporting your children in experiencing the joys <br/>\nthat are possible will you be likely to increase their vulnerability. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t believe that by saying yes to your children&#39;s dreams and desires you <br/>\nwill produce children who are needy enough to believe that whatever <br/>\nadvertised product will make them more complete or a better person. I do <br/>\nbelieve that you can imbue objects with greater power by demonizing them, by <br/>\nseparating them, by saying to others that they aren&#39;t powerful enough to <br/>\nwithstand whatever that object contains. I do believe that anything can go <br/>\nfrom the mundane to the sacred simply by limiting or denying access to that <br/>\nthing from pomegranate seeds or apples to television to a candy bar to a <br/>\npacket of chips. I know a boy who can&#39;t wait until he is grown so that he <br/>\ncan eat meat and stay up late. Meat and late nights are his coming of age <br/>\nrights. And so the morality based vegetarianism may be lost on him, because <br/>\nmeat is not murder, it is an adult privilege. It isn&#39;t his morality, it is <br/>\nhis mother&#39;s. Just as shopping at Walmart or eating at McDonalds or watching <br/>\nEd, Edd and Eddy might be for the children of somebody who is boycotting any <br/>\nof those things and making their children boycott them as well. Whether or <br/>\nnot boycotting those things is an ethical thing, if the boycott isn&#39;t your <br/>\nchoice...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe television has been on for much of the morning. It often is on for most <br/>\nof the day. Simon and Linnaea seem to enjoy the noise. They aren&#39;t watching <br/>\nit. They are finding magical rings that give them certain powers over the <br/>\nuniverse and Simon is hunting deer and wolves for him to eat or salt or <br/>\nsmoke after Linnaea skins them. Linnaea is gathering plants and nuts and <br/>\nberries, she&#39;s a vegetarian, so won&#39;t eat the meat, but she is alright with <br/>\nusing the skins to make clothes. Sometimes, in a lull of the movement and <br/>\nthe storytelling, they will stop and watch something. Just now it sparked a <br/>\nconversation about being &quot;book smart&quot; versus other kinds of smart, a <br/>\ncarryover of a conversation from last night. And, since this e-mail has <br/>\ntaken me much of 4 hours to write, Simon has been practicing juggling and <br/>\nexploring some of a fingerprinting kit and Linnaea has made a few potions <br/>\nwhile sitting in the same room as the television.

It brought books to<br/>\n&gt; the masses. Pretty impressive.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And although I understand the importance of the printing press in<br/>\n&gt; history, I was just thinking about the two biggest inventions in *OUR*<br/>\n&gt; LIVES. The TV and computer have opened up our lives so much I can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; imagine life without them any more.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Books were really the only option even when *I* was a child (TV was<br/>\n&gt; B&W and wowed me with I Love Lucy, Captain Kangaroo, and What&#39;s My<br/>\n&gt; Line?)---and definitely the only option when my parents were kids<br/>\n&gt; (well, I guess they did have radio). But TV was so limited that books<br/>\n&gt; were how you found out about the world. Books and magazines (and there<br/>\n&gt; weren&#39;t all *that* many magazines---not like now!). Books could take to<br/>\n&gt; to another world--even if you had to make up the &quot;view&quot;---I mean the<br/>\n&gt; author had to be damned descriptive to accurately &quot;paint&quot; the Serengeti<br/>\n&gt; or the Alps or that silly and amazingly beautiful bird and his mating<br/>\n&gt; dance on The Planet&#39;s Rainforest episode. ANd how many times have you<br/>\n&gt; pictured someone or something so completely different than what the<br/>\n&gt; author wrote? Only to find out later how wrong you were?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t imagine life without the incredible array of TV shows we have<br/>\n&gt; now. People seem to bitch loudest about Ed, Edd, & Eddy and the latest<br/>\n&gt; soon-to-be-nixed sit-com and the so-called &quot;reality shows&quot;---but<br/>\n&gt; tossing out the TV also tosses out all the GOOD programming out there.<br/>\n&gt; Why would you want to do THAT? Just turn the flippin&#39; channel!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The computer has opened our worlds even further. The *instant* access<br/>\n&gt; to everything printed (is anything not at our fingertips?) as well as<br/>\n&gt; photos and film clips and interviews and....And then there&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt; instant communication---I&#39;m still amazed that I can just type someone&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; name in...and THERE they are: really and truly in living color! &lt;g&gt; And<br/>\n&gt; yet there are still folks who *choose* not to have a<br/>\n&gt; computer---incredible!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The telephone would have to way up there too----and how many of us<br/>\n&gt; from the 50s & 60s actually believed we&#39;d have The Jetson&#39;s phone<br/>\n&gt; (Skype) or Captain Kirk&#39;s communicator (cell)??? But as cool as the<br/>\n&gt; phone is, I&#39;m more likely to IM a friend than I am to pick up the<br/>\n&gt; phone!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Back to the point. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; WHY would you want to deprive your child or yourself of something so<br/>\n&gt; remarkably rich?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; HOW can something so amazingly informative and beautiful and enriching<br/>\n&gt; be bad for you?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; HOW can a *box* be addictive or dangerous or powerful?

One hundred of them. The countdown was pretty cool, and I <br/>\nwas glued to the TV.

It brought books to <br/>\nthe masses. Pretty impressive.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And although I understand the importance of the printing press in <br/>\nhistory, I was just thinking about the two biggest inventions in *OUR* <br/>\nLIVES. The TV and computer have opened up our lives so much I can&#39;t <br/>\nimagine life without them any more.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Books were really the only option even when *I* was a child (TV was <br/>\nB&W and wowed me with I Love Lucy, Captain Kangaroo, and What&#39;s My <br/>\nLine?)---and definitely the only option when my parents were kids <br/>\n(well, I guess they did have radio). But TV was so limited that books <br/>\nwere how you found out about the world. Books and magazines (and there <br/>\nweren&#39;t all *that* many magazines---not like now!). Books could take to <br/>\nto another world--even if you had to make up the &quot;view&quot;---I mean the <br/>\nauthor had to be damned descriptive to accurately &quot;paint&quot; the Serengeti <br/>\nor the Alps or that silly and amazingly beautiful bird and his mating <br/>\ndance on The Planet&#39;s Rainforest episode. ANd how many times have you <br/>\npictured someone or something so completely different than what the <br/>\nauthor wrote? Only to find out later how wrong you were?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I can&#39;t imagine life without the incredible array of TV shows we have <br/>\nnow. People seem to bitch loudest about Ed, Edd, & Eddy and the latest <br/>\nsoon-to-be-nixed sit-com and the so-called &quot;reality shows&quot;---but <br/>\ntossing out the TV also tosses out all the GOOD programming out there. <br/>\nWhy would you want to do THAT? Just turn the flippin&#39; channel!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe computer has opened our worlds even further. The *instant* access <br/>\nto everything printed (is anything not at our fingertips?) as well as <br/>\nphotos and film clips and interviews and....And then there&#39;s the <br/>\ninstant communication---I&#39;m still amazed that I can just type someone&#39;s <br/>\nname in...and THERE they are: really and truly in living color! &lt;g&gt; And <br/>\nyet there are still folks who *choose* not to have a <br/>\ncomputer---incredible!<br/>\n<br/>\n  The telephone would have to way up there too----and how many of us <br/>\n from the 50s & 60s actually believed we&#39;d have The Jetson&#39;s phone <br/>\n(Skype) or Captain Kirk&#39;s communicator (cell)??? But as cool as the <br/>\nphone is, I&#39;m more likely to IM a friend than I am to pick up the <br/>\nphone!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to the point. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWHY would you want to deprive your child or yourself of something so <br/>\nremarkably rich?<br/>\n<br/>\nHOW can something so amazingly informative and beautiful and enriching <br/>\nbe bad for you?<br/>\n<br/>\nHOW can a *box* be addictive or dangerous or powerful?
