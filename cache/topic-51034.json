Prevention seems to<br/>\nwork better, than finding a cure.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   - Feed and water the children often.  If you notice incidents happening<br/>\n   prior to meal times, or  consistently just after an hour or more offer<br/>\n   fruit/cheese monkey platters or create a snack shelf/table.<br/>\n   - Does hitting happen when you are distracted by a project? When you are<br/>\n   halfway through tidying, or spacing out with a coffee?<br/>\n   - What are the warning signs?  Facial expressions?  Particular toys/rooms<br/>\n   in the home that seem to have more incidents?<br/>\n   - Is there a predictable pattern?  Every 45 minutes, or every 20?<br/>\n   - Fatigue?  If parent or child is tired it leads to issues. Words, deeds<br/>\n   or short tempers.<br/>\n   - Model conflict resolution and sharing.  If you speak to a child or your<br/>\n   partner gently it becomes the household practice.  I had no qualms about<br/>\n   letting my kids use my lipstick, or perfume or bath products.  I don&#39;t mean<br/>\n   letting anyone destroy your things or lose them, but my kids could try on my<br/>\n   jewellery to be pirates, or princes.  Wedding bands were an exception, but<br/>\n   plain silver bands can be had inexpensively and lovingly bestowed on kids :)<br/>\n   - Offer practical sharing tools.  I remember Rowan and his friend sharing<br/>\n   a toy camera, with some coaching.  They were two years of age.  The friend&#39;s<br/>\n   dad would swoop in to put contentious toys away at te first hint of<br/>\n   conflict.  I hung out and helped them work it through.  This is an exercise<br/>\n   in trust.  Pick a song or use a timer, but letting the kids pick a song<br/>\n   seems more empowering and lends itself well to the spirit of this<br/>\n   enterprise.  One has the valuable toy, while the other sings.  The first few<br/>\n   times we just passed the toy between the three of us almost like a hot<br/>\n   potato, until everyone was comfortable with the practice of letting it go,<br/>\n   only  to have the coveted item return.  They learned it quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":182207143,"authorName":"Nancy Machaj","from":"Nancy Machaj &lt;nmachaj@...&gt;","profile":"nmachaj","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re:need help problem solving","postDate":"1267132188","msgId":51156,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI2NEI1NEIxLTc4MTYtNDQ0RC1CODNBLUQzRjI0NThEOTYxRUBzYmNnbG9iYWwubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":51058,"nextInTopic":51165,"prevInTime":51155,"nextInTime":51157,"topicId":51034,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi!

She refused to  <br/>\nwear sleeves of any type, including in a coat. She often exclusively  <br/>\nwore a tank topped/shorts leotard. In winter. In Chicago. No shoes.  <br/>\nShe never got frostbite or pnemonia or anything. We just did not do  <br/>\noutdoor activities. The following winter, facing the same scene, I  <br/>\nsewed her a cloak. I lined it with fleece so it was two layers with a  <br/>\nhood. She wore it fine. It was great because it wrapped around her in  <br/>\nthe car and it was soft, no seams, no sleeves. We got the kind of  <br/>\nboots that had fleecey lining so she was fine without socks. She  <br/>\nstill often had shorts and a tank top underneath, but she was warm  <br/>\nenough.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough we do have cold winters, our condo temperature is very warm.  <br/>\nWe have radiator heat and even though we rarely (if ever) actually  <br/>\nturn our heat on, its about 75 degrees in here. We often wear shorts  <br/>\nand bare feet inside during the winter. Is it any wonder that my  <br/>\ndaughter never wants to get bundled up inside before we go out? It  <br/>\nprobably doesnt make any sense to her at all. Even last year, when  <br/>\nshe was 5 we often just took all the clothes and stuff downstairs to  <br/>\nthe door by the parking lot, where it is actually chilly. Then she  <br/>\nwould put on her boots and cloak.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would always take extra clothes with us, if I suspected she would  <br/>\nbecome cold later. But, she does really seem to run hot, like her  <br/>\ndad. We get comments almost every day &quot;isnt she cold?&quot; etc, but if  <br/>\nshe is, she really does put on m0re stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think in the winter, when its cold, and darker, there is more  <br/>\nof a natural tendency to want to stay in, stay home, hibernate. We do  <br/>\ntry to limit our obligations in the winter to cut down on the  <br/>\narguments against leaving :) Sometimes it seems its actually all  <br/>\nabout the transition, and once we get in the car, the clothes that  <br/>\nwere &quot;biting her&quot; and the shoes that were &quot;burning on fire&quot; are all  <br/>\ntotally fine. Sometimes she changes in the car into warmer/different  <br/>\nattire.<br/>\n<br/>\nsome people recommended massage or skin brushing before getting  <br/>\ndressed (parent doing to child) and that did seem to help sometimes,  <br/>\nbut I confess I am terrible about those sorts of habits and we never  <br/>\ndid it all that regularly.<br/>\n<br/>\nas for hair, I dont know how long it is, but what about a short  <br/>\nstyle? my daughter has never wanted any barrettes, pony tails,  <br/>\nbraids, or combing or brushing, so we have kept it fairly short. my  <br/>\nhair is short (very) so I guess it seems normal to her, too. I have  <br/>\nexplained to her that part of having longer hair means that you have  <br/>\nto take care of it. like washing and combing. detangle spray and  <br/>\nreallly wide tooth combs help.<br/>\n<br/>\nhope this has been helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nNancy & dh Buzz<br/>\ndd Zibby 2-16-04, Henry 9-14-07<br/>\nchicago, il, usa<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://happychildhood.homeschooljournal.net\">http://happychildhood.homeschooljournal.net</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: need help problem solving","postDate":"1266984688","msgId":51058,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMTAwMjIzMjAxMWsyMDY1ZWVmZG8zMDA4ZGY0MGYxMzQwZDY2QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDlhYzYyNmNjMTAwMjIzMTkzN3k2NzU4NzlkNndhMDY3MGQ5ZjU4NmYyZTVAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGhtMW9nbis2azAxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgkgPEEwM0Q3RjdGLUE4OTUtNENCNy05RTk4LUIwOERCNzM4QThEREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JIDw5YWM2MjZjYzEwMDIyMzE5Mzd5Njc1ODc5ZDZ3YTA2NzBkOWY1ODZmMmU1QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":51055,"nextInTopic":51156,"prevInTime":51057,"nextInTime":51059,"topicId":51034,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Karl sleeps pretty deeply now (he s awake longer hours) but when he was younger, he slept pretty light.

Don&#39;t hit your brother!&quot; Sometimes I tell her to tell me if he is bothering her, and I will help, but I think she is too young for this to be effective. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are much farther apart in age so I didn&#39;t ever deal with this, BUT, when my youngest was little, she went through a biting and hitting phase, which I think is fairly normal and common.  Since she was doing this to an 8/9 yr old, my response was to pick up the one who was doing the hitting and biting.  That seemed to work very well.  It occured to me that you could perhaps try picking up the one doing the hitting and biting first, give that one some security and comfort and block hands and mouth and work with that child to diffuse the situation, THEN pick up the baby, who is probably crying, or maybe already calmed down and back to playing.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I am wondering if anyone has ideas on how to make this bearable.

And I tend to feel quite unsatisfied and disconnected when I spend a day like that, which I do sometimes in order to get us a bit more caught up in the clean-up. I am not yet at the level of creativity to just come up with ways to clean with them, at least not ways that don&#39;t end up creating even more messes.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are 2 issues with cleaning.  The first has to do with regular maintenance and the second has to do with guests.  For guests, what I do, is prioritize what will be most important to have clean.  The place in which the guests will sleep needs to be clean with clean bedding and non cluttered, floor and surfaces.  The bathrooms that will be used should be cleaned, and the kitchen and eating areas should be cleaned up a bit, and the rest is general pick up.  Those things, depending on how regular household maintenance happens, should take 2-4 hrs.  I usually do it in 2, 2 hr segments.  When you break it down in small chunks with specific things to do, it can be done really quickly.  Bathrooms can be cleaned while little ones are in the tub taking a bath, and showers can be scrubbed quite quickly while one is taking a shower.  It literally takes less than 5 min to scrub a toilet and wipe down counters.  While you are brushing your teeth, wipe<br/>\n down a mirror.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor general maintenance, I&#39;ve never had a problem letting my kids occupy themselves with watching something they love, while I take 15-20 min to do some quick kitchen clean up, especially if I can see them and am in the same room.  With little ones, cleaning while they eat has always worked well for me.  Laundry has always happened while playing around with my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of people have recommended fly lady over the years, but I&#39;ve never taken the time to check her out.  I think one of the ideas she uses is the 10 min cleaning method.  Focus on one thing for 10 min, then stop.  It&#39;s kind of like what I do anyway.  I honestly don&#39;t care so much about how clean my house is, I mostly only care when the carpets get too messy and I need to vacuum.  Then I spend time to pick up so that I can vacuum.  That happens about once a week.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":359707411,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"Robyn Coburn &lt;dezignarob@...&gt;","profile":"designarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] need help problem solving","postDate":"1266968029","msgId":51045,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlhYzYyNmNjMTAwMjIzMTUzM240NTY3Y2IyOXg0MTBmYTEzYWVlMTBhMzZhQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhsdnBlYytyNWI0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhsdnBlYytyNWI0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":51040,"nextInTopic":51046,"prevInTime":51044,"nextInTime":51046,"topicId":51034,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well here I come with my dd s famous hair wads story, but before I tell you about that....

Put out games on a blanket that you<br/>\ncan tidy by picking up the four corners and into the toy box.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Jayn was little, I used &quot;state and wait&quot; for getting out the door. I<br/>\nwould allow a lot more time for the process, as you have discovered, and I<br/>\nwould practice concious patience. Time can be so subjective. It can feel<br/>\nlike you are waiting for 10 minutes, but lo the clock shows only 2 have<br/>\npassed. However the other side of this is to only insist on leaving for<br/>\nthings that are urgent and essential - an unchangeable doctor&#39;s appointment,<br/>\nthe last bus home, a departing plane, and sometimes, leaving the park at the<br/>\nend of the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other assumption here, is that this exit is not a surprise. I&#39;m in no<br/>\nway recommending springing something on her. The fact that you would be<br/>\nleaving for this particular reason at a particular time should have been<br/>\ncanvassed more than once earlier, including a reasonable fair warning. The<br/>\nclock has no meaning for a person this young. I would tie our departure to<br/>\nthings like &quot;at the end of this episode&quot; or &quot;as long as two episodes of<br/>\nRaven&quot; or &quot;when you have danced that two more times&quot;. Something concrete and<br/>\nrelevant to her.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;State and Wait&quot; meant stating that &quot;it is time to go&quot; and then waiting<br/>\nready by the door (or the car), and refusing to be drawn in to any of the<br/>\ndistracting, delaying strategies that Jayn would employ. &quot;Yes it is fun to<br/>\nplay dolls, but now it&#39;s time to go.&quot; &quot;Yes we can come back, but now it&#39;s<br/>\ntime to go&quot;. &quot;I know, but now it&#39;s time to go&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nVery few words. No conversation. No reasoning, no pleading. Nothing to<br/>\ninterest her, no engagement from you until she is coming out the door. Jayn<br/>\nwould say &quot;no&quot; a few times, then suddenly be ready to go, happily and I&#39;d be<br/>\nrunning down the stairs after her.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn considering clothing, in your place I would spend a lot of time when it<br/>\nis not urgent discovering the clothes that your daughter finds comfortable.<br/>\nIt might be that she wears the same one or two or three garments all the<br/>\ntime. Don&#39;t get caught up in seasons, just tote along a jacket or sweater.<br/>\nFind things that she can put on in the car if she likes. Are her regular<br/>\nclothes scratchy? Do they have labels that bug her? Would she be happier in<br/>\na loose, sleeveless shift dress? Jayn is a huge wearer of soft pants<br/>\nand tank tops - any time of the year - and her favorite footwear is flip<br/>\nflops most of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to go right out on a limb here, based again on my experience with<br/>\nJayn, and her particular sensitivities. She&#39;s only 2. Your daughter may be<br/>\ntoo young to be a happy flower girl.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure you and your sister have delightful visions of how enormously cute<br/>\nyour little sweetie would look toddling down the aisle, clutching a basket,<br/>\npossibly tossing the petals.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow is she in crowds? How is she in large, echoey spaces like a church? How<br/>\nwilling will she be to get dressed into something as complicated and fancy<br/>\nas flower girl dresses generally are? How willing and able will she be to<br/>\nstand still by the altar, or even sit still nearby, during the ceremony?<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn was supposed to be a flower girl, when she was 6. She liked her dress,<br/>\nshe liked looking like a princess, and she loved the flower crown I made for<br/>\nher. I worked out how to pull her hair back so that the ribbons on the<br/>\nflower crown hid her little tangle. She wanted to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe couldn&#39;t even walk into the church without a huge fear reaction at the<br/>\nrehearsal! She found the EMPTY church too big and scary, let alone one full<br/>\nof people. She was terrified of the space itself. She found movies hard too,<br/>\nand we would always sit right by the door. I gave her plenty of<br/>\nopportunities to change her mind, but she just couldn&#39;t do it. She was<br/>\nalready uncomfortable meeting all the new people at the couple of different<br/>\nevents beforehand.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I apologized to the bride. There were some rumblings about if the 8yo boy<br/>\nwho was the ring bearer could do it, why couldn&#39;t Jayn, from some other<br/>\nmembers of the bridal party, but I said something about different<br/>\ntemperaments and the enormous difference 2 years can make, and my dear<br/>\nfriend the bride was totally understanding. Jayn told her that she was her<br/>\nflower girl in her heart just not at the wedding.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, just be sure your dd can cope with it. And be ready for a possible<br/>\nreaction after to the stress.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow - on to the tangled hair.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom her toddlerhood my dd hated having her hair combed or brushed. She was<br/>\nalmost bald until she was 2.5, and then her hair came in very fine and curly<br/>\nand got into a tangle just from being looked at. She was so against her hair<br/>\nbeing brushed, and so much in the water from an early age, that I just let<br/>\nit go. The result was that she ended up with a pretty solid wad of hair,<br/>\nlike a giant dreadlock. It bothered me slightly when I thought about other<br/>\npeople&#39;s judgements, but she was so young and cute and it really didn&#39;t<br/>\nmatter much.<br/>\n<br/>\nCame a day, it was a July 4th and she said &quot;let&#39;s cut it off&quot;. So we did.<br/>\nThe hair under was mucky, but in pretty good condition once washed out. The<br/>\nwad was like felt. (We still have it in a bag). I believe she was 6 (it was<br/>\nshortly after the wedding thing) and as it turned out, I was very glad. She<br/>\nhad to have some big dental work - another oft told story - and I thought<br/>\nthat an untended cavity combined with bad hair might have raised flags. But<br/>\nas it was, all was well.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of months later, Jayn started neglecting brushing her hair and<br/>\nrefusing to let me do it very often. I talked to her about it, and she<br/>\nrevealed that she missed her wad. She felt that it was part of her, made her<br/>\nspecial and unique, and she wanted it back. So we let it come back. This<br/>\ntime it seemed to take a very short time to be back as a big, old wad of<br/>\nfelt again.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen again she decided to cut it off, some time before her dance recital.<br/>\nAnd here she is, a year later with sweet, wavy, thick hair just like her<br/>\ndad&#39;s, that she brushes every couple of days. Finally the short bits that<br/>\nwere where the wad was close to her scalp are grown out. She has bleached it<br/>\nblond, and is letting that grow out too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when after a few days it will get a few tangles, our technique for<br/>\ngetting them out, is that we put on a tv show, I stand behind her with the<br/>\ncomb and spray on detangler/leave in conditioner, and I work on one part<br/>\ngently pulling from the tangle ONE HAIR AT A TIME - that is the key - then<br/>\nwhen she is too irritated, I move to another part of her head - one hair at<br/>\na time and lots of spraying. This happens more and more rarely.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was uncomfortable with her having a wad at the age of 8 - and a tall 8 at<br/>\nthat (empathy for the person with the extra tall son) - because I knew it<br/>\nmade me look like a neglectful mother. James had to remind me to stop<br/>\nnervously stroking at it (which just drew more attention to it and certainly<br/>\ndidn&#39;t make it look better.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I was also able to tell anyone who asked her whole story - and how she<br/>\nwanted, really wanted it that way, it was her choice because it made her<br/>\nfeel special, that I supported her and that I knew it would only be<br/>\ntemporary. Then we saw a guy in the street with a well tended wad that<br/>\nreached his ankles in back. Fascinating, and he must have been growing it<br/>\nfor years and years - so anything could have been possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter all, it was only hair. We have that second wad in a bag too. Perhaps<br/>\none day we can use it as fertilizer if we ever have a real garden. I gather<br/>\nit will deter deer from eating your veges (or is that a myth?)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s just not worth a fight. It&#39;s only hair, and eventually she will want it<br/>\ncombed.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Your kids are still pretty little so reaching a solution might not mean anything for them yet, but it doesn&#39;t hurt to start practicing early!  I ask them, &quot;would you like me to help you work this out?&quot; and often they say no because negotiating, creative bargaining, and complex trades often seem to be part of their process. Sometimes they say yes. Sometimes I say, &quot;I think you can work this out, but if you&#39;d like me to help you I&#39;m right here.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Another situation that has been challenging is trying to get my daughter ready to leave...Of course if we are going out, she has to get dressed, and she often resists this.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Does she need to be fully dressed? Can you throw on a robe or a coat, and have her clothes with you? Sometimes my girls are in sundresses and sandals and it&#39;s blizzarding outside. I pack the warm clothes, jackets, and snow boots in a bag and we pile into the car. They know I have the warm stuff, and they are happy they weren&#39;t nagged for hours about putting on the &quot;right&quot; clothes. A friend of mine had a 3 yr old that refused to put on pants or skirts for a year. It was not surprising to see them out and about with a snuggly, green, down jacket and underpants.  Occasionally her daughter chose to wear swim bottoms.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYears ago I read an interview with Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and he said one of the best fan letters he received was from a mother of a 2-yr old who changed their song to &quot;Gimme your arm, gimme  your arm, gimme your arm now!  Gimme your leg, gimme your leg, gimme your leg now!&quot; to help her daughter get dressed.  I thought that was pretty clever and apparently the kid loved it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I was also considering doing her hair while she is sleeping.  She is a very heavy sleeper.  But somehow this seems dishonest? &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My oldest has really curly hair, and it gets pretty tangled up. I get a small amount of conditioner and rub it into the dry, tangled hair and the tangles come out really easy. There are also spray-in detanglers you can use on wet or dry hair. Personally, I don&#39;t think doing it while sleeping is dishonest or trickery. I cut my kids fingernails while they were asleep for years. Maybe thinking of it as a stress-free solution might help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; The last thing is that our house has become a pretty big mess.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Can your partner or someone play with the kids for a little bit so you can tackle the big parts? For the little bits, maybe a damp rag for your daughter to wipe down cabinets or chairs or windows? Maybe pretend you&#39;re housekeepers in a hotel and have them help pile all the laundry together for the wash? My girls love to pretend they are maids, and will get little wagons to pull around full of paper towels and damp rags, and &quot;green&quot; cleaning solutions. They&#39;ll put out fresh toilet paper rolls, wash the windows they can reach, wipe off cabinet doors, clean those sticky juice stains off the floor, scrub the toilet bowl, and do quite a lot to help.  They enjoy it a lot too.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] need help problem solving","postDate":"1266946469","msgId":51039,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJENjNCRkYxLUYxNzgtNDA0Qy05OTEyLUQ0NTIxMThDREI5MEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhsdnBlYytyNWI0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhsdnBlYytyNWI0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":51038,"nextInTopic":51040,"prevInTime":51038,"nextInTime":51040,"topicId":51034,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I do not like forcing her into clothes, she has a total meltdown if I do-=- One minor practicality about putting clothes on is if they don t have to be","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1269934199\">-=-I do not like forcing her into clothes, she has a total meltdown if  <br/>\nI do-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOne minor practicality about putting clothes on is if they don&#39;t have  <br/>\nto be pulled over the head it can be less scary and irritating.

I have been reading this list voraciously since joining, and have been researching radical unschooling and trying to put the principles into practice since last July.  Already I have seen amazing effects on my relationship with my kids, and I am hoping to start unschooling them once they reach school age.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am writing because I am having difficulty finding solutions to some specific situations.  I am hoping some of you more experienced unschoolers can help me find ways to deal with these.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne problem I am having is finding a good, peaceful way to deal with my daughter occasionally hitting, or biting, or suddenly striking my son.  She tends to do this when he is competing with her for a toy, either one she has that he wants, or vice versa.  She will often go from minor frustration, to suddenly lashing out.  Sometimes, when I am right there, I do not have enough time to prevent the attack and don&#39;t even see it coming.  Other times, I have been able to redirect the baby so he doesn&#39;t irritate his sister.  Since I started reading unschooling lists, I have made a point of being really nearby more often, but there are times when I am not close enough (or aware enough) to keep my son from being hit or bitten, and there are also times when I just cannot act quickly enough.  I am at a loss on what to say or how to respond to my daughter at these times.  Usually what I do is pick up the baby and comfort him, and tell my daughter &quot;NO! Don&#39;t hit your brother!&quot;  Sometimes I tell her to tell me if he is bothering her, and I will help, but I think she is too young for this to be effective.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother situation that has been challenging is trying to get my daughter ready to leave when we are going somewhere, either for an appointment or just an outing that is more flexible.  She does not like wearing clothes and I let her be naked most of the time at home, unless she is willing to get dressed.  Of course if we are going out, she has to get dressed, and she often resists this.  It usually takes about two (or more) hours of talking with her about leaving, making several attempts and requests for her to get dressed, reading a book while dressing her or putting on an episode of Sesame Street, etc.  Reading all of this, I guess maybe I have answered my own question, because the problems usually arise when I have not left myself enough time or actively engaged her for long enough prior to leaving in the process.  I am just wondering if there is an easier way to do this? I do not like forcing her into clothes, she has a total meltdown if I do, but there have been times when I started the preparation process with plenty of time (I thought) and she still wasn&#39;t ready to go by the time we needed to leave to be on time.  I have started telling her we have to go about two hours before we really do so we have some give time for her to resist, and this is mostly, but not always, successful.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother potential issue is that my daughter is a flower girl in my sister&#39;s wedding, which is in a month.  Right now I very rarely comb her hair, because she hates it.  Before I committed to trying to live in a more respectful way towards my daughter, my husband would comb Nisa&#39;s hair everyday, and she would scream for the duration of the combing, and I would either feel like jumping out of my skin or would just shut off to her misery and chalk it up to something that HAD to be done.  I gave up doing it myself because I couldn&#39;t handle being responsible for her being so upset.  We tried finding a way to comb her hair that she would be ok with, but nothing really worked consistently.  Sometimes I finger comb her hair while nursing her, and just stop when she starts to fuss, or if I&#39;ve gotten a lot of tangles out by finger combing and it&#39;s not too bad, I will brush it while nursing her, and that seems to be ok, but mostly I just don&#39;t comb it at all.  I have to comb it for the wedding.  Even with finger combing and brushing, I usually don&#39;t do the back of her hair b/c it is very tangled and she really doesn&#39;t tolerate me touching it at all.  I am wondering if anyone has ideas on how to make this bearable.  Right now I am planning to get in the habit of doing a bit each day, and I was also considering doing her hair while she is sleeping.  She is a very heavy sleeper.  But somehow this seems dishonest?  I don&#39;t know if that makes sense.  Kind of like hiding the vegetables in the food to get the kids to eat healthy. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe last thing is that our house has become a pretty big mess.  I have never been a great housekeeper, although I am much more motivated to clean since having children.  But now I am working really hard to meet their needs first, before working on the mess.  This pretty much means I am always behind.  My husband&#39;s parents are coming to visit next week, and I want the house to be cleaner than we usually keep it so they will be comfortable and also because I don&#39;t want to hear about how bad it is (and it is pretty bad) from them.  I am looking for creative ways to either include my children in the cleaning, kind of like Sandra&#39;s idea to play &quot;Land Before Time&quot; on the dryer when doing laundry, or just ways to engage them and keep them in the room with me while I clean.  I can sometimes wear the baby while I clean.  But my daughter seems to need my attention a lot, unless she is watching Sesame Street.  But I don&#39;t want to resort to just putting on lots of Sesame Street while I clean, because I know she would also enjoy doing things with me.  And I tend to feel quite unsatisfied and disconnected when I spend a day like that, which I do sometimes in order to get us a bit more caught up in the clean-up.  I am not yet at the level of creativity to just come up with ways to clean with them, at least not ways that don&#39;t end up creating even more messes.  Although my ability to effortlessly come up with a peaceful, fun solution to a potential problem has been wowing my socks off lately.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to say a big thank you to all the parents who keep these lists going and keep me motivated to continue learning and growing and be a little better mom each day.  I have a couple more questions, but will save them for another time b/c this is way too long already, I think.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLydia K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":51111,"nextTopicId":51044}}
