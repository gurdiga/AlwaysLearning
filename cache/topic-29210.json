But, <br/>\nin retrospect, I can see that it was really for our benefit and to <br/>\nkeep the school happy, so we could all be comfortable that we were <br/>\ndoing &#39;the right thing&#39; as far as the Department of Education was <br/>\nconcerned (the Department of Schools as I call it these days).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lesson plan lasted all of two weeks before we dumped it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the time, we were far from convinced that we&#39;d done the right <br/>\nthing. We&#39;d acted simply because we wanted our son to be happy and he <br/>\nwasn&#39;t happy with anything that reminded him of the school classroom, <br/>\nno matter how informal we made the lessons. Interestingly, it was <br/>\nwhat then happened with our son&#39;s reading that ultimately persuaded <br/>\nus we&#39;d made the right decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn his second and final year at school (Year 1), Pat had been in the <br/>\nremedial reading class. They didn&#39;t call it that, but that&#39;s <br/>\nessentially what it was. I was a parent helper in the school&#39;s <br/>\nreading program both years my son was there, so I knew first hand how <br/>\nexciting the reading classes were. Mostly you got to read inane <br/>\nlittle stories about things that were of no interest to you. <br/>\nEspecially if you were a boy. And you got to read them over and over <br/>\nagain. One of the things my son was required to do was bring a book <br/>\nhome every school day and he was supposed to read this to me and I <br/>\nwould make notes on his reading performance in a file that would then <br/>\ngo back to his teacher with the book the next school day. It took <br/>\nonly a few weeks to get through the school&#39;s entire stock of books at <br/>\nthat particular reading level and he could read them all just fine. <br/>\nIn fact, he could have read them backwards and upside down. But he <br/>\nwasn&#39;t moved up to a higher level or even taken out of the remedial <br/>\nreading program. He was still bringing home the same books over and <br/>\nover. So I&#39;d just sign the form with some useful comment or other and <br/>\ntell him to do something more useful with his valuable time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter Pat quit school, he refused to read a book. He hates them. <br/>\nThank you school for teaching my son to hate reading books. My son <br/>\nhas never read a book since school and that was five years ago. He&#39;s <br/>\nhad not even one minute of a reading lesson since school. Yet his <br/>\nreading is excellent.

There is a part of me <br/>\n&gt; that connects so much to what she has to say, the vision she <br/>\npresents. But I recognize that <br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s an ideal, and the reality has not been quite so idyllic. <br/>\nAgain, not TERRIBLE, not <br/>\n&gt; miserable kids, but, if I&#39;m honest with myself, not wholly happy <br/>\neither. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I cannot escape the plain truth that when I am doing CM stuff, <br/>\ntension comes into my <br/>\n&gt; home.

The 12yo sits patiently waiting, suppressing her frustration <br/>\nwith the rising noise <br/>\n&gt; level, the interruptions, her sister squealing because someone&#39;s <br/>\nfoot strayed one inch into <br/>\n&gt; &quot;her&quot; territory. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And I look at it this way and wonder what I&#39;m clinging to? Some <br/>\nimaginary picture? I mean, <br/>\n&gt; when I write it out like this it sounds stupid. If anyone else <br/>\ndescribed to me a scene like <br/>\n&gt; the above, I&#39;d say, Well obviously you need to ditch that. And if <br/>\nthe person said, but that&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; just a bad day--there are lots and lots of good days, great days <br/>\neven, I&#39;d be thinking, But <br/>\n&gt; the bad days are what the kids will remember.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, if I approach it from the viewpoint of saying YES as often <br/>\nas possible--well, right <br/>\n&gt; away it&#39;s clear that even in our best times, CM stuff involves a <br/>\nlot of me saying &quot;no, not <br/>\n&gt; now,&quot; etc. Saying no sweetly & cheerfully is still saying no. It&#39;s <br/>\nstill saying, what YOU want <br/>\n&gt; is not as important as what *I* want. :::sigh:::<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I get it, I really do.

My 8yo especially was quite animated over<br/>\nthe whole thing, almost outraged that the &quot;good&quot; guys (Smurfs) were<br/>\ndoing something she considered not good, not fair. This led my 12yo to<br/>\nall kinds of questions about if the good guys do something bad to<br/>\nachieve a good end, is that still &#39;good&#39; or not. Eventually we wound<br/>\nup talking about the war, Iraq, all kinds of political stuff--by then<br/>\nthe 8 and youngers were back to watching the show, but the 12yo is<br/>\nvery interested in politics and world events, and it became quite a<br/>\ndeep discussion--all from Smurfs. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I kid you not--this was before my &#39;return to unschooling mindset&#39;<br/>\nepiphany that I wrote about the other day in my &#39;saying yes&#39; post, and<br/>\nbefore I had any thought of rejoining this list--I thought &quot;this is<br/>\none of those moments Sandra Dodd&#39;s always writing about.&quot; LOL!! Maybe<br/>\nthat&#39;s what sparked the idea (weeks later) to start poking around<br/>\nSandra&#39;s site again, and to come back here. I really don&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to say being back here is sort of an unsettling experience,<br/>\nlike jumping into deep water and finding out if you still remember how<br/>\nto swim. I have swallowed a lot of water these past few days--am<br/>\nseeing more and more small moments, tiny exchanges between me and the<br/>\nkids, where I have (had) shifted into a more controlling, even rigid,<br/>\nperson, and am now trying to unclench. <br/>\n<br/>\nSara, mom of 5</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":263796257,"authorName":"Paige Parr","from":"&quot;Paige Parr&quot; &lt;autodidactsanonymous@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Smurfs, and other cartoons","postDate":"1181329253","msgId":29210,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRjNGNmM2VkMDcwNjA4MTIwMGg3NWM1YzFkZmozNjRiNDFhYzU4YTg3OGI0QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":29219,"prevInTime":29209,"nextInTime":29211,"topicId":29210,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Funny, what memories I have of the show.

My Mom used to have me help with<br/>\ndusting  the living room on Saturday mornings, and my job was always to pick<br/>\nup our little color TV so that she could dust the entertainment center under<br/>\nthe TV.  I never, ever saw any actual dust under the TV, but oh well...that<br/>\nwas my job, and it wasn&#39;t much, so I didn&#39;t complain.  My Mom was of the<br/>\nmindset that she&#39;d rather do all the cleaning, and have me help in very<br/>\nminor ways, so she could be assured that &quot;it was done RIGHT&quot;.  Anyway, seems<br/>\nlike I always held the TV against my chest when the Smurfs were on.  That&#39;s<br/>\na weird memory.<br/>\n<br/>\nI *never* liked the show, personally, but I wonder if my kids have ever even<br/>\nheard of them, or seen them.  Shelby, maybe (she&#39;s 13).  One of the reasons<br/>\nI first subscribed (years ago) to the Cartoon Network was so I could<br/>\nre-live some of those really great cartoons with my girls:  Bugs Bunny,<br/>\nDroopy the Dog, Huckleberry Hound, Tom and Jerry, Garfield and Friends.<br/>\nAlas, it&#39;s really hard to find those on now...maybe I could check<br/>\nNetflix.The Gargamel/Smurfette thing triggered a memory, though.  I thought<br/>\nit was referenced in a Kevin Smith film (we really like Smith&#39;s films), but<br/>\nI googled it and found it here:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;First of all, Papa Smurf didn&#39;t create Smurfette. Gargamel did. She was<br/>\nsent in as Gargamel&#39;s evil spy with the intention of destroying the Smurf<br/>\nvillage, but the overwhelming goodness of the Smurf way of life transformed<br/>\nher.&quot;<br/>\n~from *Donnie Darko*, 2001<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a little more, here (from IMDb), but I didn&#39;t want to get too<br/>\nraunchy.  Funny stuff, though. ;-)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://imdb.com/title/tt0246578/quotes\">http://imdb.com/title/tt0246578/quotes</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPaige, in Virginia<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://abeautifulchild.blogspot.com/\">http://abeautifulchild.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;All humans realize they are loved when witnessing the dawn; early morning<br/>\nis the triumph of good over evil.
