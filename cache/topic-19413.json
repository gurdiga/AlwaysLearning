I tried them some 15 yrs ago, the first time our family talked about helping my brother stop using, but then somehow the crisis subsided, and I got busy with my own stuff.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI had known for a while before Will left home that he was using.  I know he was using casually when he quit school, and still managed to get his GED, but was having real  trouble  motivating to work.  He seemed stuck, and I was pretty sure that only added to his use.  I think the real difference for him is that being at home didn&#39;t suck as badly for him as it did for me.  I was very motivated to find a job and leave home for anywhere else -- even Los Alamos in the winter!<br/>\n <br/>\nI was even pretty sure he was doing some minor sales in exchange for supply (since he had no funds) but I really hoped that maybe a change of scenery and friends would make a difference.  After hearing that he&#39;s threatening to come back here, I have to wonder if I&#39;m still willing to fly him out here for the inlaws&#39; visit in October.  I&#39;m worried he may fly back and just never return, and I certainly don&#39;t want him as a houseguest while the grandparents are here if he can&#39;t quit using.  I&#39;m starting to re-think that invite we extended for him to visit. <br/>\n <br/>\nI definitely need someone who has been where I am, and who is not my Mom to give me some ideas.  Again, thanks for the offer.  I&#39;ll remember to ask if I need it.<br/>\n <br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

Well, except for the one where I left the ex (ds&#39; bio-dad) who smacked him at 5 mos old -- I&#39;m pretty sure that one saved our lives.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s just that the drug and alcohol use is the one thing I most want our kids to avoid.  I know how much it screwed up my life.  I&#39;ve seen how it still affects my brother, who seems to be doing better, but who took much longer to get it all together.  We all went thru years lost to alcohol and drugs, but my sister and I straightened up much younger, because we became Moms.  My brother didn&#39;t really have to (and the jury&#39;s still out on how clean he is) until after he&#39;d lost his kids and wanted them back -- and as he saw how much damage his ex-wife was doing to them being almost constantly drunk.  <br/>\n <br/>\nBesides that, the laws and enforcement today are positively draconian compared to when I was Will&#39;s age.  Today, even a small amount of drugs can land you in jail, and detection is so much more likely.  <br/>\n <br/>\nOn some level, if my kids were girls I&#39;d worry less, figuring that even if they strayed, they&#39;d clean up for a pregnancy someday. Or maybe not.  I just feel so helpless in this for him.  I can&#39;t have him here if he asks to come home, and I can&#39;t fix his life for him.

In thinking about this more last night, it occured to me this morning that, if not for Gary&#39;s allergy to cigarette smoke and my concern for the boys&#39; health, I&#39;d probably still be a smoker.  I&#39;ve always told myself it&#39;s about stress, but really there are days (especially on a cool crisp spring morning) when I crave a cigarette so strongly I can literally taste that first drag.  I can also see if a person has a job where social drinking is expected and they are predisposed, addiction could happen.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I drank and got high on a daily basis, it wasn&#39;t that I couldn&#39;t resist the taste of alcohol or pot, but that I consciously wanted to be high -- to escape into a place where everything was funny and I had no responsbilities.

I grew up in an<br/>\n&gt; alcoholic home as well, my dad not my mom.  Of the<br/>\n&gt; four kids raised in the home, 1 became an illegal<br/>\n&gt;drug addict, one an alcoholic and the other 2 (myself<br/>\n&gt; included) so adverse to drink that we don&#39;t touch a<br/>\n&gt; drop ourselves. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>(That was me)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;But, to relate this back to kids and alcohol freedom-<br/>\n&gt;were you and your siblings &quot;allowed&quot; to sip wine or<br/>\n&gt;beer with dinner?  The alcoholics I know were<br/>\n&gt;definitely *not* free to sip wine with dinner <br/>\n&gt;in their childhood homes.<br/>\n&gt;Could it have made any difference?<br/>\n&gt;Patti<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure that being &quot;allowed&quot; an experience without<br/>\nvillifying it and making it taboo will help contribute<br/>\nto personal understanding, an informed position from<br/>\nwhich to make choices, and the lessening of the need<br/>\nto experiment.  This may in turn help someone with a<br/>\ntendancy towards alcoholism to avoid it, particularly<br/>\ngiven the opportunity to see what it feels like to<br/>\ndrink before they are old enough to have the freedom,<br/>\nability or desire to get it more often.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nreally think it will make a difference in whether a<br/>\nperson is prone to be an alcoholic or addict or not. <br/>\nIf you are, you are.  If you&#39;re gay, growing up in a<br/>\nhome full of loving acceptance for any sexual<br/>\npreferances doesn&#39;t make you straight, just by way of<br/>\nan example of what I mean.  That doesn&#39;t mean I think<br/>\nbeing gay is some detrimental disease like alcoholism,<br/>\njust that I think there are genetic predispositions<br/>\nthat apply to both that are beyond environment or<br/>\nexperience.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was plenty of alcohol available in our home and<br/>\nwe got champagne on new years well before ten, and<br/>\nwere offered wine with dinner later, and had beer and<br/>\nall manner of hard liquor available in the house.  But<br/>\nreally, on reflection over this thread, two of my<br/>\nsiblings have drug/alcohol problems and the other two<br/>\nof us don&#39;t.  What&#39;s the difference?  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, the older two who have the problems with<br/>\nsubstances are from my mom&#39;s first two marriages, and<br/>\nalthough they have different fathers than myself and<br/>\nmy other brother, both of those fathers had similar<br/>\nsubstance issues (pattern behavior on mom&#39;s part.)  So<br/>\nwe all have roughly the same genetic markers for it,<br/>\nfollowing the idea of genetics playing a large part. <br/>\nSo I asked myself what else was different.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven my mom&#39;s family&#39;s attitude towards substances,<br/>\n(anathema) and the fact that they still can&#39;t admit<br/>\nthat her sister is an alcoholic, even given that she<br/>\nis now a quadraplegic from one too many accidents<br/>\ndriving drunk, it&#39;s pretty likely that they were not<br/>\nallowed any experimentation or easy access to alcohol.<br/>\n Their dads split the scene almost before the kids<br/>\nwere old enough to remember, and they had a single mom<br/>\nuntil she married my father when they were about 10<br/>\nand 12.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other two of us, on the other hand, grew up in the<br/>\nhome with an active alcoholic who is very casual about<br/>\nalcohol; took great pride in how many guests he could<br/>\nblindside with his very hard alcoholic punch drink at<br/>\nholiday parties; ALWAYS offered drinks first to<br/>\ncompany before food; had a fully stocked bar in the<br/>\nhouse and wanted us to know how to mix drinks; took<br/>\nalcohol backpacking; drank martinis in the car, even<br/>\nwhile driving cross country, or to the grocery store,<br/>\nwhatever; and so on.  Both of us don&#39;t drink a drop,<br/>\nand don&#39;t keep any alcohol in our homes just because<br/>\nwe don&#39;t care for it, and we married people who don&#39;t<br/>\ncare for it, and have associations with it that are<br/>\nnot fun and pleasant, not because we think it is<br/>\nitself evil.  The smell of alcohol on someone&#39;s breath<br/>\nstill brings out a deep, gut level, fight or flight<br/>\npavlovian thing in me that I have to really work to<br/>\ncontrol.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, we also got strenuous lectures and<br/>\ndire threats regarding the many evils of smoking and<br/>\ndrugs (hypocritical I know) and neither of us ever had<br/>\na problem with either of those, even though I<br/>\noccassionally tried clove cigarettes when I was a<br/>\nteen, and did experiment with drgs too.  But then, no<br/>\none in our families that we saw regularly smoked, and<br/>\nI can only think of one relative whom we rarely saw<br/>\nthat did smoke, out of all the many relatives on both<br/>\nsides.  So maybe that is a different genetic<br/>\npredisposition altogether, or maybe there was no &quot;do<br/>\nas I say not as I do&quot; to rebel against in that case<br/>\nfor us.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I could have gone home and had a drink anytime I<br/>\n&gt;wanted - that didn&#39;t make me any less damaged or<br/>\n&gt;pained.  Home was such a mess that there wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;enough alcohol or drugs to make it better, and the<br/>\n&gt;pain only followed me into adulthood.<br/>\n&gt;Syl<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes exactly.  But somehow my brother and I were able<br/>\nto avoid going through the addiction stage at all, and<br/>\nhe&#39;s even still in denial about the alcoholism in the<br/>\nfamily, at least out loud, I don&#39;t know what he thinks<br/>\nto himself.  Maybe for me it was just rampant fear<br/>\nthat kept me in line until I got into Alanon and<br/>\ncounseling and dealt with baggage.  I was in<br/>\nrelationships with abusive addicts right up until I<br/>\nmarried my husband, had my first son and started<br/>\nAlanon, all in the same year.  I know that for me, my<br/>\nsurvival tactic from toddlerhood was being in<br/>\n&quot;control&quot; of every aspect that I could control.   <br/>\nBeing drunk or high is being out of control, and I<br/>\ncould not stomach that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a good thing I started learning about unschooling<br/>\nbefore my kids were born and knowing that was the way<br/>\nwe wanted to go, and that I was receptive to the idea,<br/>\nhaving fought tooth and nail to escape the box as a<br/>\nteen myself.  I know letting go of illusions of<br/>\ncontrol is a big part of an unschooling lifestyle, and<br/>\nI had a lot to let go of.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;.......  It&#39;s not just about letting kids try liquor<br/>\n&gt;at home, it&#39;s about helping them to be happy and<br/>\n&gt;strong so that they won&#39;t feel the need to escape or <br/>\n&gt;self-medicate.  IME, addiction isn&#39;t about control,<br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s about pain and lack and sadness.<br/>\n&gt;Syl<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So what happened with my brother and I, who certianly<br/>\ndid not grow happy and lacking pain and sadness, yet<br/>\nare not addicts?  I can&#39;t think of a time in my<br/>\nchildhood when I didn&#39;t suffer from depression and<br/>\naxiety and so forth.  Did we miss the genetics<br/>\nsomehow, or is it something else?  I know I have<br/>\ncraved drugs or alcohol at different times in my life<br/>\nand it scared the hell out of me and I didn&#39;t fulfill<br/>\nthe craving.  I know that despite the free access I<br/>\nexpreimented with drugs and alcohol as a teen and<br/>\nhated feeling out of control.  I know I have a<br/>\ntendancy to eat too much sugar or be obsessive about<br/>\nother things if I don&#39;t pay attention to my behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously there is no one size fits all answer to this<br/>\nproblem, but I do think that strong family<br/>\nrealtionships, strong foundations, non-villifying of<br/>\nsubstances, access to information, open and honest<br/>\nconversation, and some self control are all positively<br/>\ncontributing factors towards avoiding addiction.  None<br/>\nof it is a guarantee.  We all have to walk our own<br/>\nroad and face our own demons, even our kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I think depressed people without the genetic<br/>\n </span></blockquote>whatever-&gt;it-is can live without being addicts, and<br/>\nthat those &gt;who are prone to addiction might be<br/>\naddicts even <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;if their lives are ideal.

I spent about 5 years of my life either high or drunk (often both) as did my brother and sister.  My first husband (Will&#39;s bio-dad) comes from some really ugly alcoholism and all sorts of other abuse issues, so I worried about Will.  He grew up during the 15 or so years I spent not drinking at all (now I have an occasional glass of wine or a beer) and Gary doesn&#39;t drink at all. <br/>\n <br/>\nWe grew up being allowed to taste my Mom&#39;s drinks, and sip from Dad&#39;s beers.  With us the big taboo was smoking, because my Mom had quit after my paternal grandad died of lung cancer (caused by 40yrs of roll your owns) so we got many a lecture from Dad about the dangers of smoking.  The result?  I smoked for 5 years, my brother for about the same time, my sister still smokes, tho she quits every few years only to start again.  Mom started up again literally the day she moved out of the house to divorce Dad.  She recognizes that addictions are about self-medicating pain and depression.<br/>\n <br/>\nI had really hoped Will could skip the wasted time with drugs and alcohol.  He&#39;d been told the risks, both average and specific to his genetics.  He knows he&#39;s the latest in a long history of addictive folks on all sides.  About the great-grandfather (my ex&#39;s g&#39;pa) who suicided after a life of alcoholism that included molesting his granddaughter; that my bro and sis both still use recreationally (at times, I&#39;ve been pretty sure my bro is really just a high-functioning drunk).  <br/>\n <br/>\nFrom what I&#39;m hearing, he&#39;s more like us than I wanted -- he has to learn this for himself.  He&#39;s using but still getting to work, losing friends and running up debt.  I&#39;m sure a lot of it stems from the fact that he was public schooled, that I exerted more control and gave him less autonomy than I should have.  Probably being the only child of a single Mom who was raised in a very dysfuctional home doesn&#39;t help.  Mostly, I was just way too young and stupid to have a child at all.  I wish I&#39;d known about unschooling when he was young -- he&#39;s certainly much more at risk than the other boys genetically, and the environment I gave him early on was no help.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWith the remaining boys?  I&#39;m not sure how we&#39;ll handle it just yet, but given my genetics and history, I&#39;d be no more comfortable with illegal drugs than alcohol, even tho I agree pot should be legal.  The real problem as I see it with minor illegal drugs is the drug policy dictates sometimes very major consequences.  That can work both ways -- it can be very draconian and injurious to the casual user, or a good wake-up call for the budding addict.  Addiction is addiction, be it cigarettes, booze or drugs, and it doesn&#39;t happen in the absence of pain because it always starts as escape and escalates to self-medication.  My hope is that by raising free, happy unschooled and autonomous kids, I can help the others avoid it.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s been a tough several days around here with news of Will from my sister who just visited.  I had really hoped he would be able to hold it together for himself, but it seems his good run lasted about 8 mos and now he&#39;s losing his way.  I know we all survived it, but this doesn&#39;t make it any easier to be his Mom right now.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSyl<br/>\n <br/>\n***<br/>\nBut, to relate this back to kids and alcohol freedom- were you and <br/>\nyour siblings &quot;allowed&quot; to sip wine or beer with dinner?  The <br/>\nalcoholics I know were definitely *not* free to sip wine with dinner <br/>\nin their childhood homes.<br/>\nCould it have made any difference?  I&#39;m thinking that mabye, if they <br/>\nhad experience with it at a young age, and lots of input on how it <br/>\naffected them, (not to mention growing up in an unschooling <br/>\natmosphere) what effect would it have on their future alcoholism (or <br/>\nlack thereof)?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

In for a penny, in for a pound, kind of.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a kid has a beer, as Kelly described Cameron, he can drink a little and <br/>\nleave it there.<br/>\nIf he buys his own, or friends buy it (at kid-rates, sometimes extra much <br/>\nbecause they have to bribe an adult to get it for them), the other kids would <br/>\npress him to finish it and not &quot;waste&quot; it.  Kids will press each other to drink <br/>\nmore.  (Adults do it too.  It&#39;s way irritating.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think, though, that if someone has a strong case of alcoholism (if there <br/>\nare greater and lesser cases) it doesn&#39;t matter how old he is when he starts, <br/>\nthat will be the situation from then on, he&#39;ll either be drinking or wishing <br/>\nhe were or wishing he werne&#39;t, but not living in the absence of alcohol.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":118406848,"authorName":"joylyn","from":"joylyn &lt;joylyn@...&gt;","profile":"joylynrsf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: alcohol","postDate":"1082775669","msgId":19422,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQwODlEODc1LjIwNjAzMDVAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGM2Y2p2bytiYnVyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGM2Y2p2bytiYnVyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":19418,"nextInTopic":19426,"prevInTime":19421,"nextInTime":19423,"topicId":19413,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
