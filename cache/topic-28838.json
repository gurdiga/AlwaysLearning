But mostly, a big heartfelt thank you and posting of<br/>\ngratitude - even veteran unschoolers continue to learn from everyone.<br/>\nSeveral threads have helped me tremendously with letting go even further<br/>\nwith areas of my own life that need to be more deeply unschooled,<br/>\nspecifically in perspective to how I treat myself.  I&#39;ve made some personal<br/>\nshifts which require more time than I want to give it to explain in a two<br/>\nminute email.  While I am a confident unschooler in my relationship with my<br/>\nchildren - my relationship with myself can always use adjustment.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway.I&#39;ll be off line for the next 10 days or so - but couldn&#39;t head off<br/>\nwithout at the very least acknowledging how wonderfully exceptional<br/>\nunschooling life is.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAlways evolving,<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa Heyman<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20395,"nextTopicId":28837}}
