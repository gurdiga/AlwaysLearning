One was just a line  <br/>\ndrawing talking about how they thought early Germanic/Saxon/Viking  <br/>\nmen&#39;s clothes were cut or constructed.  One type of garment, anyway.   <br/>\nAnd the other was the diagram I made that&#39;s on that page, which I  <br/>\ndrew up one night when we let a friend borrow one of Keith&#39;s big- <br/>\nskirted tunics, and weren&#39;t going to be with him when he dressed.  He  <br/>\nbrought the paper back with the tunic and I saved it in case I&#39;d need  <br/>\nit again.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are medieval paintings of men working in fields and cutting  <br/>\nwood and their tunics (not as full as this, but with knee-length  <br/>\nskirts) are tucked up into what seems like nothing.  In those days  <br/>\nmen didn&#39;t wear pants with a crotch.  I guess they had some kinda  <br/>\nwrap (or not, but what looked like pants under those skirts were two  <br/>\ntubes of cloth�hosen, or braes�and they tied to a belt that was  <br/>\ninside.  Not a belt like we think of with a big buckle and all, but  <br/>\nsome kind of leather or cloth thing wrapped and tied around their  <br/>\nwaist or hips.  So the leggings were fastened to that.  And they  <br/>\ncould pull some of the skirt up so it was out of their way when they  <br/>\nworked.  To them it would&#39;ve made perfect sense.  Then when they&#39;re  <br/>\nthrough working, they just pull the skirt and it falls back down the  <br/>\nright way.  It&#39;s kinda like pulling up sleeves or rolling up pants  <br/>\nlegs, or even now sometimes women wearing long dresses will pull them  <br/>\nup and tie the on the side or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t seen people in the SCA do that either, but it&#39;s because  <br/>\nthey&#39;re wearing pants of one sort or another because the crotchless  <br/>\nthing has a hard time taking hold in the minds of modern folk (for  <br/>\neveryday wear).<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] for Kelly L","postDate":"1152758302","msgId":26271,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY1OEUwQTA1LTkyNjYtNDhEMi05N0FFLUY2N0ZCNDI5QkJCMEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDdCN0RFMEU5LTk3MEMtNDAxMi05MjExLUI1MzREREZERThGNUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDYwNzEyMTUwNTM2Lk9WUE00OTY0LmlibTU2YWVjLmJlbGxzb3V0aC5uZXRAbWFpbC5iZWxsc291dGgubmV0PiA8OEM4NzQxMTJBMTkyRDFDLUZDMC0yRUBtYmxrLXIxMS5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4gPDdCN0RFMEU5LTk3MEMtNDAxMi05MjExLUI1MzREREZERThGNUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":26268,"nextInTopic":26274,"prevInTime":26270,"nextInTime":26272,"topicId":26260,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I wrote and thought about skirts and kilts.
