I <br/>\nremember a while back I mentioned on one list that my son was taking <br/>\nSuzuki Piano.  I was ripped apart for having him take a class that was <br/>\nso structured and reward-based.  I should not, they told me, be sending <br/>\nhim to classes but just letting him experience life as it came and learn <br/>\nfrom that.  Now we do not school at home at all, but my boys do take <br/>\nsome classes outside the home, and they love them.  We did move on from <br/>\nSuzuki Piano, but only because my son began to tire of playing his <br/>\ntwinkles every single day when he had learned them well.  He now takes a <br/>\nmore whole-child keyboarding class, and enjoys it thoroughly.  I would <br/>\nhate to think that the definition of unschooling is so rigid that I am <br/>\nnot welcome on an unschoolers list if I let my boys take karate, art <br/>\nclasses, join scouts, etc.  After all, there are skills in the world <br/>\nthat I do not possess, and if we have found someone who does and is <br/>\nwilling to pass them (for pay or not) to my boys, I really don&#39;t think <br/>\nthat is wrong.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI second the idea that it is refreshing to find a list that seems open <br/>\nto different ideas and allows people to express them.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Irsue@...\">Irsue@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I just wanted to apologize for the flaming comment and let you know why I<br/>\n&gt; said it.

Over the <br/>\n&gt; summer, I joined<br/>\n&gt; several unschooling boards to find out more about unschooling, and was<br/>\n&gt; absolutely blown away by the amount of flaming that went on.  There <br/>\n&gt; were several new<br/>\n&gt; people on the boards, and it seemed that if they questioned an <br/>\n&gt; approach or<br/>\n&gt; asked a question as to why people approached things the way they did, <br/>\n&gt; they got<br/>\n&gt; flamed to the point their questions never got answered and they ended <br/>\n&gt; up having<br/>\n&gt; to leave the group.  A TV discussion on one of the boards really got <br/>\n&gt; out of<br/>\n&gt; hand, so that is why I was afraid to ask.  Another woman had asked the<br/>\n&gt; pornography question, and she got harassed terribly without ever <br/>\n&gt; getting her question<br/>\n&gt; answered, and I have been curious ever since.
