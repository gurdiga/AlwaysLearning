I think if we&#39;d tried to plan ahead and call and<br/>\narrange we might have been shot down because they would have had time to<br/>\nworry about injury and liability.  So I&#39;m a firm believer in the stop<br/>\nwhile your out driving around method.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso,  the homeschool groups around here organize ski trips.  It&#39;s really<br/>\nreasonable and the beginners get lessons.  You go all day, four or six<br/>\ntimes a season, or whatever, rent the equipment and it&#39;s usually during<br/>\nthe middle of the week when the slopes aren&#39;t that busy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf they like skiing but the cost is too much try cross country.  You<br/>\ndon&#39;t have to know anything just be willing to learn and fall a lot.  We<br/>\nused to rent ski&#39;s but after a while we found some second hand.  We&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen using the same skis for twelve years and we&#39;re still having fun.  <br/>\nLots of towns groom their bike trails in the winter for cross country, so<br/>\nyou might not even have to make a trip out of town.  If you do live where<br/>\nthey groom trails there&#39;s probably a ski club and you could maybe find<br/>\nsomeone to get you started.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hear from my nephew that learning to snow board is easier than learning<br/>\nto ski.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4804,"nextTopicId":4807}}
