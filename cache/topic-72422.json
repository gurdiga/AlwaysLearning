That&#39;s the day I first played with those stained-wood pattern blocks I love so much!  &quot;Attribute blocks,&quot; they were called in those days.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in a room with glass windows to the hallway, one dad was showing older kids how to paint nighttime mountain snow scenes with just three colors—white, black and blue.  OMG I had NO IDEA people could do that!  They were doing trees in canyons with moonlight and snow and it didn&#39;t look like just three colors.   <br/>\n<br/>\nPainting is beyond me, but that day I learned enough to look at oil and acrylic paintings with smarter eyes. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSeeing what&#39;s on youtube for musicians by musicians, I bet there&#39;s a ton of stuff there showing people doing things like that with paints.    I have friends who can do amazing shading with water colors, guache and inks, on medieval-style scrolls.  I can do rudimentary background ivy patterns with light green, darker green and gold, but I paint like a monkey compared to friends I&#39;ve watched.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo youtube.<br/>\nAND  museum websites of paintings, where you can look at the painting SO CLOSELY you can see brush strokes.<br/>\nOh!  Art.com, then, where they will sell prints and you can look closely before you consider buying.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she loves a particular painting, get her a poster, maybe.  My favorite is Children&#39;s Games by Breughel the Elder.  I have a poster and a jigsaw puzzle.  I bought the poster for $1 from Scholastic books in the early 1970&#39;s and once in a while I have it up for a while.    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.art.com/products/p14616442397-sa-i6774652/pieter-breughel-the-el-children-s-games-complete.htm?sorig=cat&sorigid=0&dimvals=5534841&ui=8f16f8141fe14e26bdf801780717626c&ssk=pieter+breughel+the+elder\">http://www.art.com/products/p14616442397-sa-i6774652/pieter-breughel-the-el-children-s-games-complete.htm?sorig=cat&sorigid=0&dimvals=5534841&ui=8f16f8141fe14e26bdf801780717626c&ssk=pieter+breughel+the+elder</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s history, costume, play, architecture.  Oh right. And painting. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf face painting is too much for her as a beginner, hand painting might be fun.  Painting shoes on feet is something I did with my kids when they were little, using just tempera or sometimes real body paints.  When I was little I painted bracelets and rings on my hands.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNail polish!  At the Apple store the other day one of the guys at the genius bar had his nails done with black and green chevrons.  I kept wondering if he had used tape to mask the triangles, but he said it was just freehand.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBristol, England, has street graffiti everywhere, and painted walls inside buildings, inside public bathrooms, because years ago they covered over some art by a guy who became super famous, and they regret it, so they went a bit far the other way. That can be fun to look into, and easily available on the internet.  Alison/Almadoing showed me a lot of that art and told me about it, when I stayed with her.  The artist&#39;s name was Banksy, and you can google Bristol Banksy and see lots of things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m fascinated by tromp l&#39;oeil.  You&#39;ll see some at the Banksy page.  There are many-stories-high examples in Lyon, in France.  Right behind my house there are two storage containers painted with lifesize 1950&#39;s cars that can look real even from a short distance. They&#39;re decoration for the business in front of them, that has some other things by the same artist (it&#39;s Fastino&#39;s, for locals to Albuquerque) who did full two-story-wall tromp l&#39;oeil near the university of New Mexico, behind and around Saggio&#39;s (a related restaurant).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there&#39;s electronic painting, too, which can be practiced easily with games like Draw Something (which doesn&#39;t have to be simple stick figures) and Art Pad:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://artpad.art.com/artpad/painter/\">http://artpad.art.com/artpad/painter/</a> and if she likes that you might be able to get her a computer program (or there might already be something easily available—someone here will know).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are moms here who do art.

Maybe she is literally interested in painting herself, or other people.  (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.facesbyren.com/)\">http://www.facesbyren.com/)</a>  What kinds of materials does she currently like to play with?  What kinds of art is she drawn to?  Is she interested in learning about specific artists?  Or does she like to do her own thing?  Is she interested in a broad understanding of art or does she find something(s) in particular very intriguing?  Maybe she is interested in the history of art and culture?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs would be the case for any interest, begin where that interest and her ability lie and help her build from there.  How did she express her interest?  From where did that stem?  I would say visit art museums, but if she were like my son, that would not be very interesting to her.  Maybe she likes street art or set design painting or computer graphics.  In each of those instances you would take her to very different places, introduce very different tools, explore very different resources.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra has a page with art ideas and links:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/art/\">http://sandradodd.com/art/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf you use Facebook, there is a nice group called &quot;My unschooler is interested in...&quot;  where you can share what your child is interested in, and in turn many people will post some ideas of things they&#39;ve explored or think you and your daughter might find relevant:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/383815885025681/\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/383815885025681/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":522719163,"authorName":"","from":"&lt;sukaynalabboun@...&gt;","profile":"sukaynalabboun","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"RE: fine arts","postDate":"1383087690","msgId":72426,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGw0cGVvYSsxb2hkbXVvQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGw0bjJnaysxOWFmZ3BvQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGw0bjJnaysxOWFmZ3BvQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":72425,"nextInTopic":72427,"prevInTime":72425,"nextInTime":72427,"topicId":72422,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My daughter was also interested so I started by discussing what supplies she felt she needed....for example, I suggested experimenting with acrylic paints on","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-62165219\"><p>&nbsp;My daughter was also interested so I started by discussing what supplies she felt she needed....for example, I suggested experimenting with acrylic paints on canvas, getting better brushes, special grade artists paper, pastels, coal sketching pencils, etc. I am no art expert, but I managed a small bundle of supplies to add to our pre existing ones. I started also with little investment ( I think around 20$) to see where that might lead. I also offered support and whatever knowledge I had when she asked for it. There are a lot of online tutorials, and you may be surprised with the info you have stored away ( i had read about layers and shades in paintings). The single most valuable thing, though, was being receptive to her interest and providing at least some materials for her to start experimenting.</p> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-62165219ygroups-quoted\"><br><br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ---In alwayslearning@yahoogroups.com, &lt;joanne.morehouse@...&gt; wrote:<br><br><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-62165219ygrps-yiv-1274909300\">Hi my daughter has expressed an interest in learning more about art (painting, etc) anyone know of any good resources?
