Two kinds of plants that hadn&#39;t been growing there in hundreds of &lt;br&gt;years.  One was for a dye.  The other, I don&#39;t remember, but they were common &lt;br&gt;medieval plants.  I doubt they&#39;re totally died out elsewhere or it would&#39;ve made &lt;br&gt;bigger news.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At my old house we had some hollyhocks come up where we&#39;d been mowing and so &lt;br&gt;never noticed they were there.

We do have some <br/>\ntomatos coming up and I planted the tomato plants I bought.  Janene <br/>\nreally wanted to grow blueberries and GRAPE tomatoes.  She is a tomato <br/>\nkid, when she was three I had to convince her to not eat the tomatoes <br/>\noff the vine--I really mean off the vine, she wouldn&#39;t pick it, she&#39;d <br/>\njust bend down and take a bite and then bite the next one.  Please <br/>\nJanene, wash it first?  We planted, let&#39;s see, Lettuce, carrots, <br/>\nZucchini, another type of squash (banana?), tomatoes, tomatoes, tomatoes <br/>\n(I LOVE tomatoes too, so a good 1/3 of our garden, which is total 15 x 5 <br/>\nfeet and about 8 containers are tomatoes) cucumbers (another favorite), <br/>\nartichoke (one container), bell peper, lavender, basal, chocolate mint, <br/>\nanother herb that&#39;s supposed to help with migraine headaches if made <br/>\ninto a tea) and sunflowers, giant ones, all the way around the edge of <br/>\nthe garden.  I think when we get back at the beginning of Sept there <br/>\nmight be food to eat.  Also, I did finally find a grape tomato plant for <br/>\nJanene, and we&#39;ll get another container tomorrow to put that in.  Daron, <br/>\nyou&#39;ve seen our small back yard, so you can imagine how much space is <br/>\ndevoted to plants.  I also plan on taking a few of the tomatoes and <br/>\nmaybe the artichoke and bell pepper plants into my classroom, in Sept. <br/>\n I think growing things is good for kids to see, especially these kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a tangent, I subbed in a 3rd grade class today--it was so much fun. <br/>\n I really liked the kids and had a great time.  I was asked to return <br/>\nfor four days next week, so that is good as I am unpaid this month and <br/>\nam planning that extensive vacation.  It really did help me to see the <br/>\ndifference between Lexie and these other 3rd graders (who will be in 4th <br/>\ngrade in Sept so a year older than Lexie.)  But they were a lot of fun <br/>\nand so sweet and cute.  :-)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI borrowed something like 36 books on tape from my school, for us to <br/>\nlisten to on our trip.
