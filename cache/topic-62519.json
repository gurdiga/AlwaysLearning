My son and husband really like how everything looks and functions better, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, thanks to what I learned from the blogs, presentations, and books of experienced unschoolers, I set out monkey platters of fresh food for my son and his friends while they gamed. I talked to my son about his gaming whenever I could. I found videos about Notch and Mojang (see <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2pp/minecraft-the-story-of-mojang)\">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2pp/minecraft-the-story-of-mojang)</a>. I bought him a Minecraft creeper t-shirt (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts-apparel/kids/e76a/?cpg=froogle)\">http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts-apparel/kids/e76a/?cpg=froogle)</a>, which he wore every day for 2 weeks straight. I watched tutorials on YouTube with him. My husband and I helped my son download mods and get his own Minecraft server. When he got into the &quot;Planes&quot; mod and started to fly the Fokker Dr. 1 airplane, we rented the movie &quot;The Red Baron,&quot; and I read to him about Manfred von Richthofen and WWI. He created a WWI airbase for his planes in Minecraft. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also started noticing how much my son was learning by playing Minecraft. One day I noticed that he can now type as fast as I can (learned from chatting online). He had just recently turned 9. He has also learned how to spell and punctuate, to write polite and assertive emails (e.g., to request help from the server hosts, friends, or minecraftforum.net), to download and store files on a computer, to install mods on Macs and PCs, to create Minecraft &quot;skins&quot; using a pixel art editor, and to create really cool virtual structures and games within the game. Yesterday, he showed me that he&#39;d created an agenda for himself in Minecraft. :)  He&#39;s even learned important life lessons, such as how to stand up for what&#39;s right, even when it means admitting that someone he thought was a friend was not really a friend (all related to dealing with a compulsive griefer). He has learned all this and much more through Minecraft play, while deepening friendships and having a lot of fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nStill, I missed feeling close with my son. So finally, last month, I finally got my own Minecraft account and started building with him, side-by-side. It has been so great! We&#39;re closer than we&#39;ve ever been. I&#39;m having a lot of fun. One of his friends&#39; parents told me she&#39;d heard I was a really good builder. I swelled with pride. :) But the best part is that now my son really sees me as a true friend who has embraced his passions. (And now sometimes when my husband or I have to run an errand, he asks to go with us.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSooo, my advice is to embrace Minecraft and be grateful that your child has an interest in this truly amazing and limitless game! My son has learned so much from playing it. So have I! I have to admit that my husband and I still miss traveling as a family, though. So, this year we&#39;ve decided to take our family vacation by traveling to Minecon, a huge Minecraft convention. It will be held in Las Vegas on November 18-19, 2011. We can&#39;t wait!

I don&#39;t want to take his friends.  And I actually wouldn&#39;t anyway because I can&#39;t afford to take his friends and his friends parents can&#39;t afford to pay for it.  I want to go somewhere with my son and have fun like we used to.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s only 8!

They still are even in their 20&#39;s -- <br/>\nmeaning they SUPER love certain things and DETEST other things -- they <br/>\naren&#39;t middle ground (balanced?) types. Neither am I. Is that a lot <br/>\ndifferent than you, yourself? Sometimes we see things in our kids which <br/>\nare very like ourselves and that makes us nervous. Sometimes it is when <br/>\nsomething is very different than ourselves that it gets us <br/>\nuncomfortable. Maybe one of those is true for you in this situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople whose kids get very very focused and they are passionate about <br/>\nthe (often very few) things they do sometimes complain their kids don&#39;t <br/>\nget enough breadth of experience. Others who have kids who are samplers, <br/>\nwho go along and try everything but don&#39;t show a passion for anything in <br/>\nparticular worry that their kids have no passion. In both cases, these <br/>\nare parents who are expressing an unhappiness with the way their own <br/>\nactual child really is! The child is likely to pick up on this and <br/>\nthat&#39;s not good.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think if you make real efforts to satisfy his interests - staying <br/>\nhome and having friends over - with a positive attitude and enthusiasm, <br/>\nyou will reduce the pressure and make it easier for him to venture out <br/>\nlater on. If it has turned at all into a power struggle, then going out <br/>\nnow means that he&#39;s is losing. In other words, do NOT make this <br/>\nadversarial. You should be the person who helps him get what HE needs <br/>\nand only he is in his own head and only he really knows what he needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect that if he feels that his desire to be home and desire to have <br/>\nfriends over is really truly being supported and accepted and respected, <br/>\n(not begrudgingly with the occasional bout of trying to convince him to <br/>\ngo out) that over the next few years he will be more and more likely to <br/>\nwant to go out and do other things. It will help if the things you are <br/>\ngoing out to are based on what HE is interested in, too. Keep your eye <br/>\nout for video game related events in the community, for example. We went <br/>\nto a concert recently that was all music from video games. We also went <br/>\nto a World of Warcraft art exhibit a few years ago, which was super <br/>\nsuper cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might also help if you take your own focus off the things you &quot;used <br/>\nto&quot; do together - that&#39;s life with children, they change, time marches <br/>\non, you will only be annoying to them if you try to hang on to the way <br/>\nthings were instead of being fully present now with the way things are.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of letting your uncomfortable feelings lead you to try to <br/>\npersuade him to go out, let that discomfort remind you to interact with <br/>\nhim &quot;as he is&quot; - that means at home and with his friends. It means you <br/>\nlearn about the things he is actually really interested in right now <br/>\ninstead of wishing he&#39;d be interested in what you value (skiing, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\nI got distracted because I started googling Minecraft and learning more <br/>\nabout it and now I&#39;m listening to Minecraft music which I&#39;m really <br/>\nenjoying. &lt;G&gt; That&#39;s what you should be doing. What would he think if <br/>\nyou had some Minecraft music as your ringtone? Do you even know who does <br/>\nthe music?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway -  I think the bottom line is that you have your feelings hurt <br/>\nand that&#39;s clouding your judgment. He isn&#39;t wanting to do the things you <br/>\nwant to do with him and he wants his friends over rather than wanting to <br/>\nhang out with you. Ouch. I bet that does hurt. YOU have control over how <br/>\nyou behave in these circumstances - let your logical thinking override <br/>\nyour emotional feeling response. Be a mom who totally and thoroughly <br/>\naccepts her child exactly the way he is and don&#39;t give him the message <br/>\n(verbally, physically, or any other way no matter how subtle) that he <br/>\nisn&#39;t the child you wish you had. That will hurt him WAY more than your <br/>\nrejected feelings are hurting you right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: son doesn&#39;t want to go anywhere, I do","postDate":"1314481530","msgId":62524,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGozYm9ocStmb2pjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGozYmQ0citnOWowQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":62522,"nextInTopic":62525,"prevInTime":62523,"nextInTime":62525,"topicId":62519,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ****************** This suggests you resent the fact that he s found things to love which are different than the things you love.

You get to be sad, get to cry over this. It&#39;s better to be sad and cry than to hang on to a fantasy of someone other than your real son.

I noticed you went on a 3 day trip to Seattle and it sent up a warning bell for me. Three days was probably way too long. An hour hike is probably way to long, or a day at the X (beach, fair, zoo) except on rare occasions. Once a year, a whole day out.

In the interim, pay more attention to what&#39;s fun about playing with friends. Is it the only time he gets rough and tumble play? That can be a huge issue for some kids! Is it the only time he gets to play with potty humor or gets to be really gross and have someone &quot;on his wavelength&quot;?

By the end of the winter he didn&#39;t like skiing and didn&#39;t want to go anymore.  even just tubing - it would be really hard to get him to go.  We would also do things like look for gold and dig crystals in the spring.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, we moved and ended up right next to this family we are really good friends with.  Since then, one to two of their three kids have slept over, like I said, 4 to 6 nights a week.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s been about 15 months now, and over the 15 months joe has been less and less willing to go places and do fun stuff.  He would easily stay home for a month and not request to go anywhere ever.  Even if his friends aren&#39;t here he doesn&#39;t want to go anywhere.  He won&#39;t take a walk or ride his bike with me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe also discovered a game called minecraft about 4 months ago and that&#39;s been what he does about 12 hours a day, every day.

When I let go of that idea, I began to see how much fun the games and videos are, how interesting they are.  Now my kids and I have lots of laughs while gaming together, and watching the videos together (and we all learn a lot, too).  We have serious conversations, too, as when one of my boys was getting all his virtual money in the game by asking other players to give it to him.  My other kids were giving him a hard time for &quot;begging&quot; and saying it would be better to earn the money himself.  And I mentioned that in some cultures and religions, begging would not be seen as a negative thing, but maybe as more of an opportunity to be generous to the beggar.  I also pointed out that asking other players for money takes as much time and effort as &quot;legitimate&quot; ways of making virtual money (fishing, mining, crafting, farming, etc., etc.) and requires specific skills (charm, persistence).  It turned out to be a lively discussion.

(we have someone spending the night 4 to 6 nights a week)<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like I have made his life so sparkly, fun, and interesting that now there is no room in it for other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe lived in Hawaii 2 years ago and we moved to the mainland in part so we could travel.  My son used to love to go and do new things and travel with us, but now that he is into video games he rarely wants to be far from the computer.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just came back from a three day trip to Seattle and he said he &#39;didn&#39;t really want to go&#39;, but my husband and I did really want to go and we knew he used to love to travel so we talked him into it. We had the computer, he watched it on the whole drive and while we were in the room.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was OK, he enjoyed certain things, but he was also a little mopey at the zoo and at the pier.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe considered taking a friend next time if it was possible so he would maybe have more fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nTonight is family night at his friend&#39;s house, so his friends can&#39;t spend the night so I asked if he wanted to go to the fair with me.  He said no.  (we haven&#39;t been since last year).  Then he said that he would go if his friends could go with.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis hurts my feelings.  a lot.  I don&#39;t want to take his friends.  And I actually wouldn&#39;t anyway because I can&#39;t afford to take his friends and his friends parents can&#39;t afford to pay for it.  I want to go somewhere with my son and have fun like we used to.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s only 8!  And he always wants to be home (not at his friend&#39;s house) and he always wants to be with me but he rarely wants to do anything anymore.  Just stay home.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sad about it.  and I feel like our life would be so much richer if he would occassionally want to go out and do things.  We don&#39;t go hiking because he doesn&#39;t want to.  We rarely go swimming.  He doesn&#39;t want to go the trampoline place.  or bowling.  or anything else.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62512,"nextTopicId":62570}}
