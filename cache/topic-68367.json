Morals (and since everyone has their own opinion of right and wrong<br/>\nyou can see my point)<br/>\nB. Traditions (that they may or may not want to pass on/learn)<br/>\nC. Exposing them to your interests<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have a common point of view that most parents have and everyone has<br/>\npointed it out what it is, it&#39;s faulty but it&#39;s not the end of the<br/>\nworld.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow you said that they have been veering towards the DVD player and the<br/>\ncomputer, correct?<br/>\n<br/>\nNow computer skills are very important in this period of time and will<br/>\nhelp them a lot in life, so that&#39;s not bad and you can help them expand<br/>\ntheir skills in that area such as if they want to go into the blogging<br/>\nbusiness or gaming or photo shop art or website building or hacking<br/>\n(which is actually sought after by a lot of high ranking/paying offices<br/>\nsuch as companies that do computers and the FBI and if they want to be<br/>\nspies hacking is a good skill) or anything else computer related.  In<br/>\nfact you can teach how to do taxes on the computer. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can see how your worried about them spending to much time on the<br/>\ncomputer playing games or on facebook or whatever but you can always<br/>\nlearn something from anything, facebook presents social circles and<br/>\ncommunication which is KEY in any social environment. And while computer<br/>\ngames with fighting and level ups and war may seem totally worthless<br/>\nit&#39;s actually not in fact almost all computer games present one crucial<br/>\ndetail and that is Strategy, tons and tons and tons of strategy<br/>\nexperience. The best strategists in the world are gamers, not kidding.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd concerning the DVD player it depends on what their watching and what<br/>\nyou think is appropriate for them and you can rent some documentaries<br/>\nfrom netflix for them to watch (although I don&#39;t recommend making them<br/>\nwatch documentaries any more than one at a time Once a day MAX) and try<br/>\nfinding cool ones like how to make bombs, how they build roller<br/>\ncoasters, Mythbusters is always good, and anything that has stuff their<br/>\ninterested in.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the books, the art supplies, and the music instruments go, the<br/>\nfact that she prefers black markers to oils is okay. she just probably<br/>\nlikes the feel/style better and oils tend to make your hands feel slimy<br/>\nafter using them so maybe you can invest in black art pens and art is<br/>\nart there are more styles than there are languages in the world so try<br/>\nnot to freak out. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that they&#39;re not going through every book is okay too, they<br/>\nhave their own tastes but you said you want them to explore in<br/>\nliterature, so why don&#39;t you ask them their favorite genres and then<br/>\nlook up books in those genres and then strew them in plain sight in<br/>\ntheir favorite reading places (Do not ever ask them to read them. That<br/>\nis crucial, and don&#39;t tell them you got them for them just say you got<br/>\nsome more books if they ask in passing. If they persist then you can<br/>\ntell them because teens don&#39;t like to be lied to but they also don&#39;t<br/>\nlike for you to be deciding everything for them hence partial truth) and<br/>\nsee if they read them. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if your worried about if it&#39;s just Si-Fi or fantasy you&#39;d be<br/>\nsurprised how much you can learn from either, I learned more about Greek<br/>\nMythology from Percy Jackson than from my greek myths books although<br/>\nthey made great references and the si-fi books gives a lot of<br/>\nperspective on theories about space travel, alternate dimensions,<br/>\nphysics, and intelligent non-human life (which if your wondering it&#39;s<br/>\nbeen in HUGE debate with scientists for the past hundred years or more<br/>\nand it&#39;s good to have a back ground knowledge of it). <br/>\n<br/>\nSo down to the Musical instruments, playing an music instrument is an<br/>\nart. It&#39;s something you have to love and be interested in or else it<br/>\nbecomes a torture device on your nerves and then you&#39;d like nothing more<br/>\nthan smash it to smithereenes. And those opinions tend to form after the<br/>\npoint of just playing them for fun just to have musical noise. But if<br/>\neither of them has a favorite musical instrument they like to play<br/>\noccasionally try finding out what their favorite type of music is and<br/>\nthen find the music sheets for their favorite songs then strew them<br/>\naround said instrument in plain sight (Now almost same principle with<br/>\nthe books, Do Not Ever ask them to try out the music you strew, and Do<br/>\nNot tell them you got them for them unless they ask directly and answer<br/>\nin the mild such as &quot;Oh I looked it up for you since you like it you<br/>\nlike to listen to it&quot; you have to put the sentence as a gift or else it<br/>\nbecomes a command and my example isn&#39;t that great so maybe you can think<br/>\nof something better) and if they actually try playing Do Not watch at<br/>\nfirst wait until they become more comfortable with the song and then you<br/>\ncan watch and give Honest compliments, feel free to be amazed BUT Don&#39;t<br/>\nexaggerate and above all Do Not Under Any circumstances give them advice<br/>\non how to do it better UNLESS They Specifically ASK for It. and then you<br/>\nshould ONLY give it in said area and stop talking when their face<br/>\nbecomes bored. Now if in the case that they&#39;re not into playing music<br/>\nthe best thing for you to do is Accept It, I&#39;m sorry but if they&#39;re not<br/>\ninto it they&#39;re not into it and forcing them to try will only create<br/>\ntension which will lead to friction and then finally complete and utter<br/>\nhatred of said instrument which will probably won&#39;t wear off for several<br/>\nyears if ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have a control problem and you can admit it which in my experience<br/>\nis something not a lot of people can do so congrats. So the thing you<br/>\nhave to come to terms is that your children are not you, even though<br/>\nthey have parts of you in them, so your going to have let go of your<br/>\npride, but I&#39;m pretty sure you knew this wasn&#39;t going to be easy when<br/>\nyou went down this path and I&#39;m sure the final moments of teaching your<br/>\nchildren never are. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the fact that you went down this path shows that although love<br/>\ncookie cutter educations you were sorta willing to give it up so your<br/>\nchildren wouldn&#39;t have to be caged and choked to death by it which I<br/>\nhave to say is quite admirable, even though your questions suggest that<br/>\nyour either have doubts or are still working on your perspective of the<br/>\nwhole Unschooling thing, but at least your working on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn another email you mentioned that you were preparing your son for<br/>\ncollege, Now college implies what? <br/>\nA. Preparing you for the Career you want.<br/>\nB. A piece of paper that opens doors to well paying Jobs/security in<br/>\nlife<br/>\nC. Giving you the knowledge you want so you can kick off your Life <br/>\n<br/>\nNow for every person college means something different even if only<br/>\nfractionally different from someone else. You seem to see it as a<br/>\nsecurity thing which it is in a way. But from that perspective will only<br/>\ntake someone so far. And then there the colleges themselves and just<br/>\nbecause it&#39;s a college doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the right one for him. In fact<br/>\nwhen starting out in life and actually throughout life a HUGE part of<br/>\nbeing successful in life is doing something you love or else you slowly<br/>\ndegrade yourself into a hole of misery and hard sharp feelings of<br/>\nregret, which come to think of it is how a lot divorces are helped<br/>\nalong. So anyway you see my partial point, I hope. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo are you preparing him for college or for his Career or for the Life<br/>\nhe wants? You seem to be doing either A or B but at least B, now if your<br/>\ndoing A I&#39;m sorry but your going to have to as him what he wants to do<br/>\nbecause this is his chance at life not yours (That was harsh i know but<br/>\nit&#39;s true) and then if he doesn&#39;t do it himself (you shouldn&#39;t him ask<br/>\nto either) you should look up colleges that specialize in whatever it is<br/>\nand then discuss (NOT TELL HIM) with him what he would like to do and<br/>\npresent OPTIONS (all of which can be denied). <br/>\n<br/>\nIf B then do what everyone else does when preparing for college take the<br/>\nnormal classes, normal tests, look at normal community/state colleges<br/>\nthen send him off and tell him to get good grades and to afterward get a<br/>\nnormal boring desk job at some insurance firm and than he can live his<br/>\ntotally boring and depressing normal life (you can totally see I&#39;m<br/>\nbiased against B but not against you don&#39;t worry, I can see the appeal<br/>\nof survival). <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd C which is like A but with a much wider range of options and is the<br/>\none I&#39;m going to do, this option has everything that A has and applies<br/>\nto someone like me. College for me will have all the things I&#39;m<br/>\ninterested in Business classes, Food Science, Mechanics, whatever<br/>\nlanguage i&#39;m on, a whole bunch of different literature classes,<br/>\nchemistry, maybe physics, maybe software development, don&#39;t know my<br/>\nentire life shall be an never ending series of perusing interests and<br/>\nhobbies and major discoveries I fully expect to die just like Leonardo<br/>\nDa Vinci halfway through a million projects. I see college as part of my<br/>\nlearning experience and also a piece of paper that will unlock doors<br/>\notherwise closed to me. There are also other points of view concerning<br/>\ncollege which I&#39;m sure other people can tell you and your family can<br/>\ndecide for yourselves whats the best choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that&#39;s my advice, Good Luck. <br/>\n- Kate</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":472480490,"authorName":"sheeboo2","from":"&quot;sheeboo2&quot; &lt;brmino@...&gt;","profile":"sheeboo2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: New member, with a couple of really big questions","postDate":"1343410609","msgId":68397,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGp1dWpqaCtpYmNiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PENBT09UYVhPM1VqQ3BhMTBRRmZPREdoUGNLZDY0TjhZVDEta1ExeVVLK29EMVJ3djA4d0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":68395,"nextInTopic":68406,"prevInTime":68396,"nextInTime":68398,"topicId":68367,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

They&#39;d play the piano because that&#39;s what accomplished kids did, right? I wasn&#39;t &quot;accomplished&quot; like that, but they would be. At the end of homeschooling, they&#39;d end up being like the rich kids from my school, (like I couldn&#39;t be) only better because they wouldn&#39;t have to go through school to get there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was not in the front of my consciousness, but it was definitely there. I&#39;m so grateful we were unschooling a very short time when I realized the vision was there, and dropped it in favor of being with the people who were right here in front of me, who loved SpongeBob and didn&#39;t want to play music because it hurt his ears, and who thought (still thinks) fart jokes are the epitome of humor.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot that those are exclusive, the &quot;classical&quot; interests and SpongeBob and fart jokes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you had a vision all these years, only you weren&#39;t aware you had that vision until your kids &quot;failed&quot; to meet it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake a deep breath. More than one. Enjoy your kids&#39; interests. Find out, if you don&#39;t already know, what they&#39;re doing on the computer. Find things that are related or similar, that they might enjoy, and bring those to them, or see if they want to go do related things - cons, meetups, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nBe with the people in front of you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd - be with yourself. A big part of my unschooling journey has been accepting and appreciating who I am and what I bring to the table, even though I&#39;m not the rich girls from my high school who had everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nFind what&#39;s in your kids&#39; lives - and your life - to love, right now. Then love it.<br/>\n<br/>\npeace,<br/>\nCaren</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":300223612,"authorName":"in4mkaren","from":"&quot;in4mkaren&quot; &lt;kasmail@...&gt;","profile":"in4mkaren","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Learn Nothing Day","postDate":"1343395854","msgId":68381,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGp1dTU2ZStqMnVwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PENFNUQxQzNCLURDQUMtNDdDNy05OTA5LUE4NUYxMUM1MzlGREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":68377,"nextInTopic":68382,"prevInTime":68380,"nextInTime":68382,"topicId":68367,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My 10 yo son s reaction to Learn Nothing Day was priceless!

He&#39;s found a medium he likes. That may change, or it may not. There are origami artists who never move beyond one sheet of paper, no cuts. There are glass artists who never include other media in their glass work. There are fiber artists who Only knit, or Only do hand quilting. My partner works Only with electric guitars. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou provide materials, but people choose what appeals to them. Not all the wonderful stuff you find and offer will be used. Lately I bought a kind of drawing tool for the computer, since my daughter loves to draw on the computer and I wanted to offer her something beyond the mouse. Turns out she prefers the mouse because it produces the kinds of big heavy lines she likes at the moment. The other tool is better for sketching or painting and that&#39;s not what she wants to do... right now. Artists&#39; interests and techniques can change and lately her paper and pencil drawings aren&#39;t using the same kinds of lines as before - maybe she&#39;ll get into the new tool. Maybe not. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the &quot;fake outs&quot; of schools is that kids are often thrilled to explore new materials because a classroom is pretty empty. In a rich, full home, kids have more choices so they make more choices out of personal interest and less out of &quot;oh, thank god, something New and Different!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; If Lego creations and computer skill count, my kids are geniuses.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How sad that you don&#39;t value their genius. I&#39;ll tell you a story. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was a smart kid, good in school and at schooly things and my parents were justly proud. They encouraged me in my academic pursuits... but my real passion wasn&#39;t in that direction, it was in making things with my hands. They didn&#39;t value that, so it was poo-pooed as an amusing hobby I would hopefully grow out of at any moment. I trusted them and their assurances that it was more important to pursue my academics and set my goals accordingly. In college I did well and got into a really nice lab as an undergrad - I was on the fast track to having my name on a good paper before I got my BS, which would set me up nicely to get into a good grad program yada yada yada. Then I realized the job I loved best in the lab was being done professionally by a woman with nothing more than a high school diploma. I looked around and realized I still loved to work with my hands, loved it far far more than all the rest. I felt cheated and lost. With the best of intentions, my parents had nudged me away from my passions. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;But they have not begun to scratch the surface of the oppotunities here, and I fear that they never will.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>************<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you&#39;re saying they&#39;ll fail to live up to their potential.

Kids do have a tendency to enjoy what their parents<br/>\nenjoy, but only mainly because they see the parents having so much fun!<br/>\nBut as soon as it becomes a requirement ... forget about it.  Kids are<br/>\nsmart.  You may not feel like you are &quot;requiring&quot; them to enjoy the<br/>\n&quot;treasures&quot; you have left around, but in some way you are.  Else you<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be here asking the question because you wouldn&#39;t have an<br/>\nattachment to that stuff and their enjoyment of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n====I don&#39;t want to give the impression that all the books have gone unread<br/>\nand all the resources have gone unused. We have used them in the course of<br/>\nour homeschooling,====<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may very well be the fact that this stuff was used in a more regimented<br/>\nhomeschooling way that is turning them off to it.  Even though you see it<br/>\nas fun stuff, they may see it as stuff that is (or was) used for a certain<br/>\ntime of day, when mom requires it.  And why would they want to use it on<br/>\ntheir own when they will be required to use it anyway?  Just saying you<br/>\naren&#39;t required to use it anymore, doesn&#39;t change the trepidation they<br/>\nhave.  They are afraid you will require it again.  And it sounds like they<br/>\nmight be right.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring my public school years, I was a voracious reader.  My mom would take<br/>\nme to the library when I was in 6th grade and I would pick out 4 or 5<br/>\nchapter books and I would have them all read within a week.  I didn&#39;t watch<br/>\nTV, I read.  I loved reading.  I would pick reading over almost anything<br/>\nelse, always.  But as soon as I was required to read a book for school.<br/>\nForget about it.  I didn&#39;t want to read it, and more often than not, I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t read it at all.  It became tedious for me.  The books for school<br/>\nwere no different than the ones I was choosing for myself (I had read Gone<br/>\nwith the Wind on my own in 6th grade!), but just the fact that there was<br/>\nnow some sort of requirement, made me disinterested beyond belief.  I<br/>\ncannot tell you how many book reports I wrote without ever having read the<br/>\nbook, which just seems silly from someone who could read an entire chapter<br/>\nbook in a day, but there it was.  Do not underestimate the power of<br/>\nrequirements.  The effect they have on people are very strong.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===Happily, we are now in a very low-regulation state, and the sky is the<br/>\nlimit.===<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though you felt you were more hands off than most traditional<br/>\nhomeschoolers, you never really were an unschooler.  You still sat the kids<br/>\ndown and required them to do something.  They now have this impression of<br/>\nlearning & school, like it or not. It sounds you are fairly new to<br/>\nunschooling in it&#39;s entirety.  I would allow some time for deschooling, I<br/>\nwould allow time for your kids to stop viewing the books and activities as<br/>\npart of school.  I would allow them time to find their own interests.<br/>\nPerhaps the computer and video games are their passion.  And what of it?  I<br/>\nhave a really good friend that just got a job at Blizzard within the last<br/>\ncouple days.  All his friends and family seemed to be excited for him.<br/>\nThey didn&#39;t seem to mind that that was where his passion for gaming led<br/>\nhim.  What if he had been forced to read story books and draw pictures<br/>\ninstead of playing video games or absorbing the computer?  What if his<br/>\nparents had envisioned a life of drawing comic books for him?  (Ya know<br/>\nbecause that&#39;s a fun alternative job.)  Where would he be today?  Probably<br/>\nnot working at Blizzard or a comic book company.  Probably wandering around<br/>\naimlessly like most people are, trying to spend their adult years<br/>\nreclaiming the passion they were never allowed to have as a kid.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===If it&#39;s educational, we have it.===<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd what would you deem not educational?  I can&#39;t seem to touch anything or<br/>\ngo anywhere without learning something.  This is why Sandra&#39;s &quot;Learn<br/>\nNothing Day&quot; is so silly.  Can you really go a whole day without learning<br/>\nsomething?  Why does something have to be labeled &quot;educational&quot; before it<br/>\nis deemed worthy of being absorbed in my brain?  Learning to walk is<br/>\nuseless because I was never tested on it, learning to cook was trivial<br/>\nthen, learning to balance my checkbook hardly seems worth the effort.<br/>\nYears ago I used my computer knowledge to learn how to create an online<br/>\nforum.  I learned to make it into a thriving community, one with a lot of<br/>\ndaily visitors.  A few years later, I learned how to negotiate a sale of<br/>\nthis community.  A sale that was the catalyst for allowing me to stay home<br/>\nwith my son, allowing my family to live the way we had always wanted to.<br/>\nBut none of this was really worth the effort because it was something I<br/>\nlearned to do on the computer.  And the computer can&#39;t be educational<br/>\nright?  You cannot predict the future, you never know where a skill will<br/>\nlead someone or how it will help them in adulthood.
