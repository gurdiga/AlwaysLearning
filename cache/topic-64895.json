I also believe that Montessori would have been a supporter of unschooling, as you say, her first environments were set up to mimic the home environment as closely as possible.  I have always felt it was so sad that she was such an advocate for children and children and parents/mothers that she couldn&#39;t raise her own child until after her mother died.  It must have been very painful<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also say that although there are many many aspects of Montessori-as-practiced which are not congruent with unschooling principles, what I have taken from it is a deep trust that a child in his or her natural state has a great desire to learn and that if we can keep out of the way, provide a wonderful rich environment and be a loving presence, that child will blossom and learn exactly as they are supposed to.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRight now we are having our long summer break (7 weeks) so I am pretending we are already unschooling!

Compared to regular classrooms, Montessori is much closer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to allowing kids to learn naturally. But the classroom is an artificial<br/>\n&gt; &gt; environment and limits what and how kids are able to explore. If kids have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the opportunity to learn from life, to have one on one interaction with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their parent, to explore their interests freely, then that&#39;s even better<br/>\n&gt; &gt; than Montessori.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was thinking the same thing, plus you could start homeschooling with a<br/>\n&gt; Montessori-at-home approach and then relax away from even that (easy to do<br/>\n&gt; since Montessori is really aimed at pre-school children, mostly).  If you<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t seen the Michael Olaf Montessori catalog - the articles IN the<br/>\n&gt; catalog are a great justification for unschooling. (I hope they&#39;re still<br/>\n&gt; available - haven&#39;t looked at it in years, but google it and find out.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also - for reluctant spouses - you might show them the &quot;unschooling course<br/>\n&gt; of study&quot; that is on Sandra&#39;s website. The descriptions of how kids will be<br/>\n&gt; exposed to all the various academic subjects could be really useful and,<br/>\n&gt; again, sort of sounds like it fits in with a Montessori approach for older<br/>\n&gt; kids (where kids work independently on their own projects at their own<br/>\n&gt; speed). This is a link to the one that I wrote for elementary school age<br/>\n&gt; children - in California we homeschool as our own private schools and are<br/>\n&gt; supposed to have a course of study on file....so that is what this is. &lt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/acme1\">http://sandradodd.com/acme1</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -pam<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":238430032,"authorName":"Catherine Hassall","from":"Catherine Hassall &lt;cat@...&gt;","profile":"caterinasenang","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Making a better choice","postDate":"1326409580","msgId":64978,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlEMEVFQzQ4LTFDMTktNDQ2MS05REMxLUQ0NzMzNjY1QjlBNEBjdWx0dXJlbGFiLm9yZy5hdT4="},"prevInTopic":64977,"nextInTopic":64979,"prevInTime":64977,"nextInTime":64979,"topicId":64895,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"re. ice play we also make ice castles: freeze lots of different sized plastic containers full of water and then empty out onto the ground and arrange in castle","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1190470942\">re. ice play<br/>\n<br/>\nwe also make ice castles:<br/>\nfreeze lots of different sized plastic containers full of water<br/>\nand then empty out onto the ground and arrange in castle stacks<br/>\n. .   watch them melt<br/>\n<br/>\nalso ice boats:<br/>\nfill a take-away or ice cream container etc with water<br/>\nsome food colouring<br/>\nand blue-tac a skewer to the bottom<br/>\nstanding up so you can<br/>\npush a piece of paper onto it as a sail<br/>\nwhen its frozen<br/>\n  the ice-boat in water<br/>\n. . and watch it melt<br/>\nblow on the sail . . .<br/>\n<br/>\nand freezing things in ice is nice<br/>\nlike flowers and glitter<br/>\nyou can put string in the water<br/>\nand then hang the ice up in a tree<br/>\nand look at the beautiful things in the ice<br/>\nas it melts<br/>\nthis works also with filling a balloon<br/>\nwith water and pretty things<br/>\nand then take the balloon off<br/>\nand float or hang<br/>\n<br/>\nwe love ice<br/>\nhere in the tropics<br/>\nxcat</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276080282,"authorName":"delphini004","from":"&quot;delphini004&quot; &lt;delphini004@...&gt;","profile":"delphini004","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Making a better choice","postDate":"1326405506","msgId":64977,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGplbmwyMityNDBvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDRDODdGMjQ5LTAyMDAtNDE0NS05MTgzLTFBMjJFRTlBQTUxOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":64976,"nextInTopic":64978,"prevInTime":64976,"nextInTime":64978,"topicId":64895,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**--- If you get to the point that you think they have more right to decide where to go than either or both of you have to decide for them,  then you ll be on","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1914676709\">**--- If you get to the point that you think they have more right to decide where to go than either or both of you have to decide for them,  then you&#39;ll be on the verge of unschooling. :-) ---**<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote> I think this could be a good post for Just Add Light And Stir. <br/>\n<br/>\nEdith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276080282,"authorName":"delphini004","from":"&quot;delphini004&quot; &lt;delphini004@...&gt;","profile":"delphini004","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Making a better choice","postDate":"1326403834","msgId":64976,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGplbmpkcStyMTZmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEI4RkQ5QjkxLTMzRTktNDNFQi05QjkxLTk0QkFDMEJBNTNDNUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":64973,"nextInTopic":64977,"prevInTime":64975,"nextInTime":64977,"topicId":64895,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

She wanted to bring  natural learning to them , as they would learn at home. Then that was adapted to low income children, who;s parents were absent at war or working. Those were kids left alone in the streets all day. She wanted to create a home environment where they could learn naturally like if they were home with parents. She says several times in her books how parents are very important and kids should be with parents but those kids did not have available parents. Also Maria herself  left her son for someone else to raise and she was not part of his life growing up. Then when he was an adult he joined her and had his own ideas about the method. A lot of what is done now in Montessori come from his ideas which I really do not like.<br/>\n<br/>\n Reading Maria I would assume that she would probably really agree with unschooling..

I now think both are valuable for different reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then there is the whole very rigid way<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the teacher is supposed to &quot;introduce&quot; a new type of &quot;work.&quot; The &quot;lesson&quot;<br/>\n&gt; that has to be done just right and the kids aren&#39;t allowed to even try to<br/>\n&gt; do something until they&#39;ve had the lesson given to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, it&#39;s a bit more complicated than this, or should be.  A child can be presented something by the teacher, by another child, or by watching another child be presented something.  In my classroom if a child took something out he/she hadn&#39;t been shown I took it as my cue to sit down immediately and help the child explore.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; The one thing Montessori has going for it is the idea that each child<br/>\n&gt; should be allowed to work on what they choose to work on (within the<br/>\n&gt; confines of the materials offered to them) and that they can work at their<br/>\n&gt; own level.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Otherwise, not much of use to unschoolers or helpful to someone trying to<br/>\n&gt; &quot;get&quot; unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, I&#39;d say that&#39;s pretty true.

Good early-childhood teachers and centers are pretty much exactly as you&#39;ve described.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was teaching, it was in a.Montessori environment, so a little different in some ways but definitely very trustful and respectful of the child.  Adult as facilitator, children interacting with a wonderfully rich environment, no forced group times, no group &#39;teaching&#39;, huge emphasis on following strengths and interests and always &#39;the gift of time&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, there are also many aspects I am questioning and discarding, which is difficult.  Montessori can be prescriptive and restrictive, although good teachers shouldn&#39;t be.  Expectations of capability and independence is, I now think, too high.  The suspicion of technology is also a problem I think now, although it was never specifically condemned by Montessori herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t really about unschooling though, so I&#39;ll stop now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnna<br/>\n<br/>\nMother to Abigail, nearly five<br/>\nand Evangeline, just turned two<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Wed, Jan 11, 2012 at 1:43 PM, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-=- How embarrassing, I&#39;m actually a trained early childhood teacher<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (eek!) -=-<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s certainly not something that could be done in school.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The only thing to be embarrassed about is the idea that being a trained<br/>\n&gt; &gt; early childhood teacher would help you with unschooling.
