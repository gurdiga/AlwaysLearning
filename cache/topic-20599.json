I like being seven.&quot;  And so forth.<br/>\n<br/>\nPretty sweet, I think, to be content where they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say &quot;I wish you could have stayed little forever because your little <br/>\nclothes were so cute, and I loved carrying you around, and I loved nursing you <br/>\nto sleep.&quot;  Or whatever fantasy stage/age she was pining for.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never pressed her to grow up, but I sympathized with her wish to stay <br/>\nyoung, and would tell her good things I remembered about being that age too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThrough all, I&#39;ve said, &quot;You might feel different when you&#39;re older,&quot; and <br/>\n&quot;You can stay with us as long as you want to,&quot; and &quot;You don&#39;t have to act any <br/>\ndifferently just because you&#39;re ten&quot; (eleven, twelve).<br/>\n<br/>\nThey Do feel the urge to leave, later. <br/>\nHaving been gone for eight days, when Kirby came back from wherever he had <br/>\nbeen last night, I said &quot;Did you do okay without having a mom for a whole week?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHis response was quick and sincere: &quot;It was GREAT!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI could&#39;ve expressed hurt feelings, but it didn&#39;t hurt my feelings.  It&#39;s <br/>\ngood that he got to have a week without me and he didn&#39;t have to move away to get <br/>\nit.  He&#39;s eighteen.  Lots of kids his age are away at college, having months <br/>\nwithout mom.  Some are already themselves parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s eighteen and getting ready to consider living as an adult, but he&#39;s not <br/>\nquite ready yet.  And that&#39;s okay with us.  We&#39;re neither rushing him out the <br/>\ndoor nor holding him down.   Growth is inevitable, and we shouldn&#39;t try to <br/>\nmanage it because we really can&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20359,"nextTopicId":20601}}
