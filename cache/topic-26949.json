I might&#39;ve when I was in my 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s, but with  <br/>\nage comes confidence and focus, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile it&#39;s probably instinctive with many women to try to make  <br/>\nfriends with other women (in gatherer terms, I guess, they don&#39;t want  <br/>\nto be shunned when root gathering trips come or some damned thing),  <br/>\nbut we&#39;re on the internet, google can be used for gathering, and I  <br/>\nonly want friendships with those who are as eager about radical  <br/>\nunschooling as I am.<br/>\n<br/>\nI already know what I want to do and have been doing it for a while.   <br/>\nI don&#39;t want to help  moms feel better about being angsty, indecisive  <br/>\nmoms.  I want kids to feel better, be freer, feel more empowered.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do realize that many moms are not themselves whole enough not to be  <br/>\nneedy of attention and mothering, but there are codependency and  <br/>\ninner child sites for that.  It&#39;s not my direct interest to soothe  <br/>\nand groom moms and hear their tales of woe.  I&#39;m VERY willing to  <br/>\nsoothe and groom parents whose goal is to unschool and who aren&#39;t  <br/>\njust around to get the kind of attention they should be giving to  <br/>\ntheir children.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot everyone can unschool.  I feel no duty or obligation to comfort  <br/>\nthose who can&#39;t or don&#39;t want to.  It&#39;s not a party, but some people  <br/>\nsee the discussions as a party instead of as people processing  <br/>\ninformation they need for the task at hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough it can be really fun to discuss it, that doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re  <br/>\njust goofing around discussing whatever.  Because we can talk about  <br/>\nwhat SEEMS like all kinds of things, doesn&#39;t mean that every single  <br/>\nthing is appropriate.  And lots of people think education-related is  <br/>\nmore &quot;on topic&quot; than things like...  once we discussed Alan Rickman  <br/>\nfor a while. That&#39;s more on topic, to my thinking, than justification  <br/>\nof labelling kids ADHD.   With ADHD, you wound children.  With Alan  <br/>\nRickman movies, you don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could give lots of examples, and some people reading what&#39;s above   <br/>\nmight be less clear about my intentions for this list and others  <br/>\nmight be less clear.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210653085,"authorName":"Kim H","from":"&quot;Kim H&quot; &lt;kimlewismark@...&gt;","profile":"kimhoussenloge","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"sandra","postDate":"1158393634","msgId":26949,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNGUwMWM2ZDk2NiQ4NjlmZDBiMCRlMWU3ZWRkY0BraW04Y2U4YWYzNTQzZT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":26955,"prevInTime":26948,"nextInTime":26950,"topicId":26949,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Sandra, I just wanted to let you know how very much I appreciate the way you respond to everyone at this group.
