I was a great multi-tasker and leader, but because of those<br/>\ndeep labels I still felt very insecure about my abilities.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, isn&#39;t it sad that the very labels that are considered &quot;bad&quot; in<br/>\nschool, are actually a bonus when applied in something the person<br/>\nexcels at? So sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I&#39;m hyper. Not hyper in the sense that I need to move<br/>\nphysically all the time, but my brain is hyper!:) I don&#39;t need much<br/>\nsleep, I am thinking constantly and always have about 20 projects going.<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to get in a rut because I&#39;m short on<br/>\nideas, I get in ruts because I have TOO many and can&#39;t figure out<br/>\nwhere to go next. sigh.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t mind the word being applied to ME...but I am very quick to<br/>\nhush anyone that says it in a negative way in front of Jalen.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s SO physical and intense and explosive sometimes. I was watching<br/>\nhim with playdough the other day and his movements are literally<br/>\nfrenetic. He makes this funny noise and moves REALLY fast, almost like<br/>\nhe&#39;s &quot;stuck&quot; and doesn&#39;t notice anything around him. I&#39;m so thankful<br/>\nwe really, totally embraced radical unschooling before he came<br/>\nalong..I can&#39;t imagine how hard life would be for him if we weren&#39;t<br/>\nunderstanding of his temperment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bet you&#39;re finding a lot of healing through parenting your child<br/>\nwithout all those labels and negative connotations associated with<br/>\nbehavior. That&#39;s so great.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23851,"nextTopicId":23934}}
