We can work to open up a crack for<br/>\nthem, but they just might find another crack that suite them better, and<br/>\nmake their way to the sunlight in spite of our efforts.

I hadn&#39;t really taken <br/>\ntime to analyze my own school situation in detail.  Bluck! Who wants <br/>\nto do that?<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter writing my thoughts and considering the profundity of the <br/>\nwords (ok, at least they were profound to me), I just _had_ to share <br/>\nthem with someone.  So, I hope you don&#39;t mind and hope that it might <br/>\nresonate with other&#39;s experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, <br/>\n-Dana<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Invisible Authority<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a child I was always trying to please the adults in my life.  <br/>\nProbably the thing that school educated me in the most was pleasing <br/>\nothers for pleasing&#39;s sake.   With worksheet after worksheet of <br/>\nquestions, grades and tests I was in a perpetual pleasing fest.  <br/>\nNever did it occur to me that this was not desirable. Certainly, the <br/>\nteachers gave me ample positive feedback when I was the proper <br/>\nsoldier marching to their beat.  Any interest I had separate from my <br/>\nteachers would be deemed not worthy, especially if it wasn&#39;t tested <br/>\nand graded, so I became dependent on the system to assign me my <br/>\ninterests not to mention level of self worth.  The damage this has <br/>\ndone to me as a grown adult is difficult to calculate.  I wonder <br/>\nwhat kind of person I would be today if I had developed my own <br/>\ninterests along the way untainted by school bias.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith all the years of pleasing and meeting other&#39;s expectations I <br/>\nbelieve that I was so accustomed to it that I was not comfortable <br/>\nwithout the external pressures of school.  I was kind of lost <br/>\nwithout someone to give me my marching orders.  After finishing my <br/>\nschooling I tried staying in my comfort level by spending my time <br/>\ntrying to meet some kind of invisible expectation set by some <br/>\ninvisible authority.  This was completely subconscious of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe unschooling philosophy has given me a new perspective and, for <br/>\nthe first time in my life, I have the &quot;invisible authority&quot; to <br/>\npursue what interests me and go about it in a way that is free from <br/>\nexpectation and, for lack of better words, accomplished in a joyful <br/>\nmanner.  I need this &quot;authority&quot;, you see; I am still crippled from <br/>\nthe system I grew up under.  If it weren&#39;t for my parents turning a <br/>\nblind eye to our performance in school and never having any ambition <br/>\nfor us (I can&#39;t remember a single time they asked to see my report <br/>\ncard), I might have permanently been in limbo with no self esteem to <br/>\nspeak of.  Still, with the large influence on me from 16 years of <br/>\nschool, I have spent a fair amount of my adulthood becoming <br/>\nacquainted with who I really am.  This is really a shame if you <br/>\nthink about it; all my teachers who cared so much, yet managed to <br/>\nsuffocate and cripple me to the point where I had to be away from <br/>\nthe school system for more than a decade to repair the effects.  <br/>\nEven then, I was not really seeing how much better things could be <br/>\nbefore I was introduced to the concepts of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can only imagine what gift we are handing our children by allowing <br/>\nthem to get on with the business of self discovery and not putting <br/>\ntheir lives on hold for some other &quot;authority&quot;.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21878,"nextTopicId":21887}}
