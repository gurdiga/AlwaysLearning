My dh loves the Sierra Nevada&#39;s, I just liked the idea of naming her something nature oriented. We wanted something of the earth for her first name, and something of the sky/heavens for a middle name...ideally. That name fit both desires.<br/>\nJalen&#39;s name means &quot;calm ocean&quot; (Jalen Kai), but it doesn&#39;t fit him at ALL right now. He does love the ocean at least.<br/>\nThe other two kids we weren&#39;t so creative with, we just wanted names we weren&#39;t arguing about!<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLearn about unschooling at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19837,"nextTopicId":19847}}
