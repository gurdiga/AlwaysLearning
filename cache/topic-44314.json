Kirtland  <br/>\nis the air force base.  Marty (her brother) drove her,  Julie (an  <br/>\nunschooler they&#39;ve known since birth; Carol Rice&#39;s youngest) and Bo  <br/>\n(who did the art for my unschooling page (trees and random-machine),  <br/>\nin his jeep.  Flying Star is a bakery/magazine-stand/sandwich-shop- <br/>\nturning-restaurant (chain).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMarch 24th and 25th<br/>\nIt&#39;s Sunday afternoon and it&#39;s been a very, very long weekend already.<br/>\n<br/>\nFriday<br/>\n<br/>\nMorning- 9:20 am<br/>\nwaking up, long shower, general getting ready to go.<br/>\nStems- 11:00 am<br/>\nThere&#39;s a woman named Diane who&#39;s there to help us out through  <br/>\nMother&#39;s Day, she&#39;s from Long Island and pretty chill. She and Debbie  <br/>\ndid arrangements and corsages and boots, I wired and taped spray roses  <br/>\nand answered the phone and such.<br/>\nHome- 3:20 pm<br/>\nHung out, ate, made plans.<br/>\nMike&#39;s house- 5:40 pm<br/>\nChilled with Mike and Zach, they played guitar (Mike fixed his), Zach  <br/>\nsaid he had to go this play at La Cueva, Mike said he didn&#39;t want to,  <br/>\nI said I wanted to go to Trader Joe&#39;s.<br/>\nOut- 6:30 pm<br/>\nWent to Trader Joes, re-met this guy Chris in the parking lot, went to  <br/>\nLa Cueva, watched the play (The Odd Couple)... Whatnot.<br/>\nIHOP- 10:00 pm<br/>\nIntroduced Kyle to everybody. Ordered crepes and french fries, had a  <br/>\nreally, really good time. Drove home, blah, blah, blah. Marty drove me  <br/>\nand Julie and Bo across town.<br/>\nMordor- 12:20 am<br/>\nGot to see and ride Bo&#39;s BOMB new skateboard! Walked around, skated,  <br/>\nclimbed. Went home around like 2:00 am I guess, went to bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaturday<br/>\n<br/>\nMorning- 7:30 am<br/>\nGiggity got up, my mom made me breakfast and a lunch to-go, and I was  <br/>\noff!<br/>\nKirtland Flower Shop- 9:00 am<br/>\nI opened and got the computer turned on and everything, no problems,  <br/>\nKatie came and actually ended up staying for a long time which I was  <br/>\nhappy about, when I was there by myself I put 50 of those plastic  <br/>\nwater things on 50 yellow roses and sold some balloons and a rose  <br/>\nbundle. Elizabeth showed up and I left. Stopped by Stems to mark my  <br/>\nhours down.<br/>\nHome- 2:00 pm (ish?)<br/>\nSuppose I did some hanging out and MySpace. Thought about taking a  <br/>\nnap, ended up just listening to Amy Steinberg and hopping in the  <br/>\nshower. I called work (Zumiez) Angie wants me to come in, and because  <br/>\nI expressed my negative opinion on being called in, Mason offered to  <br/>\ncover my closing shift, so I would leave when he would have left.  <br/>\n(7:30) Quickly ate some macaroni as prep.<br/>\nMALL<br/>\nZumiez- 5:05 pm<br/>\nI did what I do, son! For the majority of being there we listened to  <br/>\nJake&#39;s iPod; Jake&#39;s got some good stuff on that! Great night though,  <br/>\nAngie said it&#39;s cool if Mason closed. When it was getting close to  <br/>\n7:30 Angie told me she didn&#39;t want me to go because I was keeping her  <br/>\nspirits up of sorts, so I agreed to dance for the rest of the 10  <br/>\nminutes of my shift. I think it worked to make her happy. I hung out  <br/>\nan extra couple minutes, I was in a really weird, loud, and repetitive  <br/>\nmood. You know how it goes.<br/>\nHot Topic- 7:50+ pm<br/>\nWent over to Hot Topic and met Fabian (I&#39;m actually gonna have to  <br/>\ndouble check on his name), didn&#39;t end up getting any Jamaican colored  <br/>\nanything, but it&#39;s all good. I ran to the escalator and quickly  <br/>\nchatted with these kids who&#39;s friend got in trouble earlier and then  <br/>\nran to Shoe Fitters, said &#39;yo wassup&#39;, ran back to Zumiez, said yo,  <br/>\nyo, yo and goodbye again, and left.<br/>\nOut and About- 8:15 pm<br/>\nHeaded down to Gold and 8th, called my mom and got stuck in traffic.  <br/>\nWhen I got there, though, Emily was really lost, so I waited in my car  <br/>\nand listened to my iPod.<br/>\nFlying Star- 9:15 pm<br/>\nEmily and I ordered ourselves some Mac and Cheese with some Raspberry  <br/>\nChocolate cake goodness. That was such a good hour of the day. Very  <br/>\nenjoyable.<br/>\nBack in the Car- 10:10 pm<br/>\nBack in traffic, going to a party, trying to get directions. Brett and  <br/>\nmy mom were very helpful.<br/>\nTimmy&#39;s house- 10:35 pm<br/>\n================<br/>\nSteering away from the step-by-step:<br/>\nIt was an incredible and fun party. DJ, glow sticks and all. Right  <br/>\naround 1:45 or so the police showed up. A lot of people had already  <br/>\nleft and a lot of people ditched out and a lot of people were sent  <br/>\nhome and then some people got in trouble. Which I guess equals out to  <br/>\na lot of people, right?

My older (public-schooled) kids have each been involved in things like this at one time or another. They are now 22, 18, and 16 but they&#39;ve always told me the truth, I think because our relationship was always open and trusting, and because I was never the type to ground or punish. (I have one friend who still has trouble wrapping her mind around the fact that my boys managed to make it to adulthood without ever having  been grounded.) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year, my daughter, who was 15 at the time, got caught shoplifting at the mall with a friend. They led her, handcuffed, in tears, through the public part of the mall, and she eventually had to do community service and write a letter of apology (although none of it is on her record). On the way home, we had a serious talk, in which I shared that I had been caught shop lifting at the same age. I was angry, and she knew it, but I wanted to let her know that I understood, and that I love her no matter what. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t ground her or punish her in any way, but s he recently told me that the worst moment of her life so far was when I came to pick her up at the police station and she saw the look on my face.

Those with young children or who <br/>\ndon&#39;t like long posts can skip it. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy introduction is that each of our children has been in trouble with <br/>\nthe law now. <br/>\nKirby drove his friend Joey home about four blocks, and he forgot to <br/>\nturn his headlights on. We went to court and they let him pay the <br/>\nfine without talking to the judge. <br/>\n<br/>\nMarty was on a playground in a public park after hours (parks close at <br/>\n10:00 or 10:30)--not drinking, not doing anything but playing on the <br/>\nslides with three other people, one 21 and the others 18, 19. He did <br/>\ntwo days of community service at the Red Cross office. (He reminded <br/>\nme that he also was ticketed for stopping too hard at a stop light. <br/>\nHe stopped, but not gracefully, and we went to court and he paid a <br/>\nfine and went to a driving class. No alcohol nor any other such thing <br/>\ninvolved.) <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly&#39;s is slightly worse than these. <br/>\n<br/>\nLast night at 2:20 Holly (17) called on the house phone. There&#39;s one <br/>\nby our bed. She sounded like she was afraid and embarrassed, and said <br/>\nthat the party had been busted, and she needed us to come and pick her <br/>\nup. The police said she needed at least one parent to come. And she <br/>\nwas afraid she might have parked the car where it would have been <br/>\ntowed. She couldn&#39;t see it from where she was. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I woke Keith up and told him. Keith had fallen asleep really early <br/>\nbecause he had been helping clean a group camping site in Edgewood for <br/>\nseveral hours Saturday morning and afternoon. Brett had been <br/>\nplanning to go to the party when I had gone to bed, but Brett had had <br/>\na too-long day at work and had come home to discuss that and to play <br/>\nWorld of Warcraft. (Brett is Holly&#39;s boyfriend, who&#39;s staying with <br/>\nus, for those new to the saga.) <br/>\n<br/>\nBrett&#39;s car was in the driveway and the house was dark, so we went out <br/>\nquietly. I thought maybe he could be spared the worry, and it&#39;s <br/>\npossible that Holly wouldn&#39;t have wanted him there, but just us. <br/>\n<br/>\nI went back to get a big flannel sheet, because besides &quot;bust&quot; Holly <br/>\nhad also mentioned &quot;wrestling in pudding.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI knew where she was, because it was a house she&#39;d never been to <br/>\nbefore, hosting a party for a couple she&#39;s known separately a long <br/>\ntime, and together. One was having a birthday; the other had <br/>\nsufficiently recovered from a broken neck in a car accident (he&#39;s <br/>\nmobile), to share a party. She had been scheduled to go to his <br/>\nbirthday party a couple of months ago when he had the accident. <br/>\nBrett and I had helped (by phone) figure out exactly where the house <br/>\nwas and how she could best get there from where she was after work. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who know Albuquerque, we&#39;re near the mountains (Juan Tabo <br/>\nand Candelaria) and she was down past the university, across from <br/>\nRoosevelt Park. It&#39;s eight miles or ten, maybe. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs we were driving, we discussed what the best tack to take would be. <br/>\nWe shouldn&#39;t be too cheery about it. We weren&#39;t going to act harsher <br/>\nthan we felt. I was thinking at that time it might be a marijuana <br/>\nsituation. <br/>\n<br/>\nA mile from the house Marty called. He had been invited to the party, <br/>\nbut had opted to go to a couple of parties his girlfriend had been <br/>\ninvited to instead. They were done there, and he had called to see <br/>\nif the birthday/recovery party was still on, and the birthday-person <br/>\nanswered her cell from her car, where she was driving drunks home. <br/>\nShe told Marty what she knew. So I was relieved it was alcohol and <br/>\npudding, rather than drugs. <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly had been the second youngest person at the party. The sixteen <br/>\nyear old girl was asked &quot;were you drinking?&quot; and she said &quot;no,&quot; so <br/>\nthey said &quot;Go home.&quot; Everyone over 21 who could prove it was told <br/>\nto go home. (Holly&#39;s unsure if any of them got citations). Holly had <br/>\nsaid yes, about drinking, so they told her to call her parents. And <br/>\nHolly didn&#39;t know the other girl, nor several of the people at the <br/>\nparty. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe birthday hostess (not resident) had wanted to stay with Holly but <br/>\nthe police told her she needed to leave and help get the intoxicated <br/>\nfriends safely home. <br/>\n<br/>\nMarty (20, her brother) had been willing to go and get Holly, but I <br/>\ntold him it needed to be a parent and we were already on the way. So <br/>\nhe said he and Ashlee-his-girlfriend would go on to our house. I told <br/>\nhim Brett didn&#39;t know yet, so maybe not to bother him with it but let <br/>\nHolly tell him, unless he asked directly. I thought he was asleep. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust a minute or so later, Brett (25, her boyfriend) called. It was <br/>\n2:40 or so by then, and he had been just about to go to sleep but <br/>\ncalled Holly to see if she was okay and when she was coming back. <br/>\nThe police let her answer the phone. She told him we were on our way <br/>\nto get her, so I told him what I knew and that Marty was on his way <br/>\nhome. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt that point I thought how cool it was that we were all in such close <br/>\ncommunication. The day I was in an accident a couple or three weeks <br/>\nago, before I had left the scene, Keith and Holly and Brett were there <br/>\nwith me. Marty was at work, or he probably would&#39;ve been there too. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe got to the house and she was sitting on the porch, chocolate <br/>\npudding in her hair and everywhere, drying. There were four <br/>\npolicemen, and another one in the house. Holly was the last one <br/>\nthere besides the two who lived there. She was wearing a t-shirt and <br/>\nshorts, and was barefooted. I wrapped the flannel sheet around her. <br/>\nKeith did the talking, and not much. Everyone was courteous and <br/>\nsomber but not tense. Keith apologized and thanked them, and the one <br/>\nwho was in charge of Holly before we got there said they were just <br/>\ndoing their jobs, and Keith said &quot;Well, I need to do mine too,&quot; and <br/>\nthe guy said he was a parent too, and these things happen. So there <br/>\nwas no shaming or defensiveness or anything. She was cited, and I <br/>\ncan&#39;t read the details on our copy, but I think it&#39;s possession of <br/>\nalcohol by a minor. Maybe it&#39;s consumption. It has a number I can&#39;t <br/>\nsee well enough to look it up. <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly asked if she could go inside and go to the bathroom. The <br/>\nofficer said &quot;You&#39;re in the custody of your parents now--it&#39;s up to <br/>\nthem.&quot; We all looked at each other. It wasn&#39;t my house; I didn&#39;t <br/>\nknow the residents. Keith said &quot;Go pee.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile she was gone we talked a little. There was a big dark smear on <br/>\nthe bottom concrete step there by the front door. I said &quot;I assume <br/>\nthat&#39;s pudding, and not blood.&quot; One of the cops said, &quot;Yeah. There&#39;s <br/>\npudding everywhere in there. There&#39;s pudding on me.&quot; Another one <br/>\nsaid &quot;There&#39;s pudding on my flashlight.&quot; It would&#39;ve been funny, <br/>\nbut we were all in straight-face, this isn&#39;t funny mode. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ll be contacted by the juvenile probation department. The <br/>\npoliceman used the term &quot;intake,&quot; and I asked what that meant. He <br/>\nsaid they&#39;ll want to determine whether she needs alcohol abuse <br/>\ntreatment, and whether she&#39;s in a safe situation. Okay. I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink homeschooling will be an issue, and she&#39;s old enough to drop out <br/>\nor graduate anyway, if she were in high school. She has two part- <br/>\ntime jobs, and that will help (if they don&#39;t pull a child labor law <br/>\ntrick out of the hat &lt;g&gt;). She hasn&#39;t been in trouble, and that will <br/>\nhelp. No damage to people or property. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the drinking she did was one jello shooter, and tastes of two <br/>\nother people&#39;s drinks. She said she never had a drink of her own. <br/>\nThere weren&#39;t any drinking games. There were people there not <br/>\ndrinking at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe could have lied, but she didn&#39;t. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she came out of the house she was crying--frustration and <br/>\nembarrassment kind of crying. Stress. <br/>\n<br/>\nThings seemed to be a smooth as possible under the circumstances. <br/>\nWhen we were leaving, the police could leave, and the two guys who <br/>\nlived there walked them out too, and said good night and thanks and <br/>\ngood bye, and Holly rode back with Keith in the van where the heater <br/>\nhad been on, and I followed them back in the car. When we got home <br/>\nshe was crying, but I do know she told Keith some of the story on the <br/>\nway home and also talked to the birthday hostess to tell her she was <br/>\nokay. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe got home and she went into the shower. I took the pudding clothes <br/>\nand put them in the washing machine so I could turn it on right after <br/>\nshe turned the shower off. The laundry was her bikini top, the <br/>\nPunisher t-shirt her friend Jared had taken off and put on her so <br/>\nshe&#39;d be wearing more than just a bikini top and shorts, another t- <br/>\nshirt someone had offered up for people to wipe jello off of them, and <br/>\nshe said she would bring back clean. Her shorts and underwear, and <br/>\nthe sheet. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe was unsettled and lightly agitated. I offered to sleep with her <br/>\nin the library and she gratefully took me up on that. I closed down <br/>\nthe house, re-ran the laundry, left notes so Keith and Brett would <br/>\nknow where we were if they woke up, and went and fixed up that bed. <br/>\nSo I curled up behind her and stroked her hair and her arm and told <br/>\nher I loved her and I was sorry she had cried, and she asked what I <br/>\nwas thinking about it all, and how much trouble she might be in. I <br/>\ntold her there might be a fine, and she&#39;d probably have unsupervised <br/>\nprobation, since nobody was hurt and there wasn&#39;t any malice. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know who all might&#39;ve been charged besides Holly and the <br/>\nresident hosts. I&#39;m willing to provide follow-ups on this. If I&#39;m <br/>\ngoing to be telling how wonderful our lives are, it&#39;s only fair to <br/>\ngive some detail on the less than wonderful times. <br/>\n<br/>\nAshlee (now 23) told me last night that when she was 15 she spent the <br/>\nnight with a friend, and they got a ride to a party on the other end <br/>\nof town. She grew up 20 miles north of here in Bernalillo, a little <br/>\nfarm town two miles long. The girls were walking home from the <br/>\nparty, really late, and the police came and took each of them to her <br/>\nown home. Ashlee&#39;s parents grounded her from watching MTV for a year, <br/>\nshe said, because they were sure watching MTV had made her wild. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re not grounding Holly from anything. We didn&#39;t congratulate her <br/>\nor make light of it, but she was fully remorseful and is more <br/>\nconcerned about how we feel about it, and the inconvenience to us in <br/>\nthe middle of the night, than about her own outcome. She&#39;ll be 18 in <br/>\nNovember, and juvenile offenses like this are wiped off, in New <br/>\nMexico. Or maybe it will be wiped when she&#39;s 21, or after the <br/>\nprobationary period; I don&#39;t know. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe police seemed to have felt better after they asked Holly whether <br/>\nany of the girls were pudding-wrestling for money. Holly didn&#39;t <br/>\nreally understand the question, and I didn&#39;t even hear about it until <br/>\nlater, but it makes more sense now, thinking back to when the youngest <br/>\nofficer said &quot;It was a party activity,&quot; and I said &quot;Well I guess it&#39;s <br/>\ngood it wasn&#39;t just her and one other girl,&quot; and he said &quot;No, they <br/>\nwere all doing it.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nKeith says guys pay money to watch girls wrestle, so they were <br/>\nwondering whether it was a sex show or prostitution. Oh, see? I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t even think about that. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne more story for now... She said she was the last one up the stairs <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":122460111,"authorName":"Tammy Curry","from":"Tammy Curry &lt;mamabeart00@...&gt;","profile":"mamabeart00","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: I&#39;ll tell this here, but not on my blog","postDate":"1240799340","msgId":44334,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk4NDc0MS4yMjA5Mi5xbUB3ZWI0NTMxNC5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDdlYTYzYWY1MDkwNDI2MTg1MXUzMWZhNTAzYWtmY2FhOWU0MmYyYTYyMGFkQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDNBNzJDMjZBLTdDMDUtNDNDMC04REI0LURENDI2NTYwRTAxQUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gIDxndDJzcTgrcW51YkBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPDdlYTYzYWY1MDkwNDI2MTg1MXUzMWZhNTAzYWtmY2FhOWU0MmYyYTYyMGFkQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44333,"nextInTopic":44335,"prevInTime":44333,"nextInTime":44335,"topicId":44314,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This actually touched me very deeply.

However, it shows that life is a bed of roses thorns and all. We all make mistakes and should take responsibility for them but having close, loving relationships to help support us even then is just as important. It is something my family is seeing more and more. There was no reason for Holly to lie, she had her family to support her and love her and just as important no one stood and judged her actions. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the police officers, I have run into good, bad, and indifferent. It sounds like the good ones showed up. I can understand their concerns having once been one of those wild ones at wild parties where we actually were on a first name basis with our local PD very quickly. Having your own guiding principles does not always mean they will supersede laws that are in effect. A mistake was made and a law was broken, one of the reasons records are sealed at 18 for most incidents like this is because young people do make mistakes. Once they are of the majority they have, in most cases, learned and moved on, so they get a fresh start in the next stage of life&#39;s journey. <br/>\n<br/>\nLife happens, we learn and move on. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTammy Curry, Director of Chaos<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tammycurry.blogspot.com/\">http://tammycurry.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://crazy-homeschool-adventures.blogspot.com/\">http://crazy-homeschool-adventures.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If a child is to keep alive his inborn sense of wonder, he needs the companionship of at least one adult who can share it, rediscovering with him the joy, excitement and mystery of the world we live in.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRachel Carson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":381959449,"authorName":"kelly_sturman","from":"&quot;kelly_sturman&quot; &lt;conspicuousfamily@...&gt;","profile":"kelly_sturman","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: I&#39;ll tell this here, but not on my blog","postDate":"1240798011","msgId":44332,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGd0MzN2cis3MzZmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGd0MnNxOCtxbnViQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44331,"nextInTopic":44333,"prevInTime":44331,"nextInTime":44333,"topicId":44314,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We talked about how to handle<br/>\nthat sort of situation in the future, but that was her response at the<br/>\ntime because she was upset and afraid.  She knows that she can hang up<br/>\non someone who is yelling at her over the phone, and she also knows that<br/>\nif she gets the chance, she can retract the lie she told and apologize<br/>\nfor having lied.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really like Chamille&#39;s honesty.  She has friends that aren&#39;t always<br/>\nhonest, and it&#39;s hard to know where you stand in those circumstances.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t like being made into a patsy believing someone who&#39;s lied to me. <br/>\nSometimes I&#39;ve told Chamille that a don&#39;t ask, don&#39;t tell policy is<br/>\nbetter than outright lying.  I don&#39;t like knowing that a kid is sneaking<br/>\nover to our house against their parent&#39;s wishes.  I&#39;d rather not be in<br/>\nthe know on that.  If a kid wants to be dishonest to their own parents,<br/>\nthat&#39;s one thing, by telling me, they are making me responsible for it. <br/>\nSometimes Chamille tells me anyway simply because she&#39;s very honest and<br/>\nwe discuss the pros and cons of knowing and not knowing about someone<br/>\nelse&#39;s misdeeds and being party to it.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"katherand@gmail.com","from":"katherand@...","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] I&#39;ll tell this here, but not on my blog","postDate":"1240778446","msgId":44324,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ1MmE1YzZmODM4M2Q1ODcxZDM1Y2RlMGZjMDMwMjkwQGdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEU1RjYwOERGLTk1NzktNEUzMS05OEQ2LUNBOUYyQjA3QUMwNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEU1RjYwOERGLTk1NzktNEUzMS05OEQ2LUNBOUYyQjA3QUMwNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":44323,"nextInTopic":44325,"prevInTime":44323,"nextInTime":44325,"topicId":44314,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... unschooling.

We went to court and they let him pay the  <br/>\n&gt; fine without talking to the judge.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Marty was on a playground in a public park after hours (parks close at  <br/>\n&gt; 10:00 or 10:30)--not drinking, not doing anything but playing on the  <br/>\n&gt; slides with three other people, one 21 and the others 18, 19.  He did  <br/>\n&gt; two days of community service at the Red Cross office.  (He reminded  <br/>\n&gt; me that he also was ticketed for stopping too hard at a stop light.   <br/>\n&gt; He stopped, but not gracefully, and we went to court and he paid a  <br/>\n&gt; fine and went to a driving class.  No alcohol nor any other such thing  <br/>\n&gt; involved.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Holly&#39;s is slightly worse than these.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Last night at 2:20 Holly (17) called on the house phone.  There&#39;s one  <br/>\n&gt; by our bed.  She sounded like she was afraid and embarrassed, and said  <br/>\n&gt; that the party had been busted, and she needed us to come and pick her  <br/>\n&gt; up.  The police said she needed at least one parent to come.  And she  <br/>\n&gt; was afraid she might have parked the car where it would have been  <br/>\n&gt; towed.  She couldn&#39;t see it from where she was.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So I woke Keith up and told him.  Keith had fallen asleep really early  <br/>\n&gt; because he had been helping clean a group camping site in Edgewood for  <br/>\n&gt; several hours Saturday morning and afternoon.   Brett had been  <br/>\n&gt; planning to go to the party when I had gone to bed, but Brett had had  <br/>\n&gt; a too-long day at work and had come home to discuss that and to play  <br/>\n&gt; World of Warcraft.  (Brett is Holly&#39;s boyfriend, who&#39;s staying with  <br/>\n&gt; us, for those new to the saga.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Brett&#39;s car was in the driveway and the house was dark, so we went out  <br/>\n&gt; quietly.  I thought maybe he could be spared the worry, and it&#39;s  <br/>\n&gt; possible that Holly wouldn&#39;t have wanted him there, but just us.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I went back to get a big flannel sheet, because besides  &quot;bust&quot; Holly  <br/>\n&gt; had also mentioned &quot;wrestling in pudding.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I knew where she was, because it was a house she&#39;d never been to  <br/>\n&gt; before, hosting a party for a couple she&#39;s known separately a long  <br/>\n&gt; time, and together.  One was having a birthday; the other had  <br/>\n&gt; sufficiently recovered from a broken neck in a car accident (he&#39;s  <br/>\n&gt; mobile), to share a party.  She had been scheduled to go to his  <br/>\n&gt; birthday party a couple of months ago when he had the accident.    <br/>\n&gt; Brett and I had helped (by phone) figure out exactly where the house  <br/>\n&gt; was and how she could best get there from where she was after work.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For those who know Albuquerque, we&#39;re near the mountains (Juan Tabo  <br/>\n&gt; and Candelaria) and she was down past the university, across from  <br/>\n&gt; Roosevelt Park.  It&#39;s eight miles or ten, maybe.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As we were driving, we discussed what the best tack to take would be.   <br/>\n&gt; We shouldn&#39;t be too cheery about it.  We weren&#39;t going to act harsher  <br/>\n&gt; than we felt.  I was thinking at that time it might be a marijuana  <br/>\n&gt; situation.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A mile from the house Marty called.  He had been invited to the party,  <br/>\n&gt; but had opted to go to a couple of parties his girlfriend had been  <br/>\n&gt; invited to instead.   They were done there, and he had called to see  <br/>\n&gt; if the birthday/recovery party was still on, and the birthday-person  <br/>\n&gt; answered her cell from her car, where she was driving drunks home.    <br/>\n&gt; She told Marty what she knew.  So I was relieved it was alcohol and  <br/>\n&gt; pudding, rather than drugs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Holly had been the second youngest person at the party.   The sixteen  <br/>\n&gt; year old girl was asked &quot;were you drinking?&quot; and she said &quot;no,&quot; so  <br/>\n&gt; they said &quot;Go home.&quot;    Everyone over 21 who could prove it was told  <br/>\n&gt; to go home.  (Holly&#39;s unsure if any of them got citations).  Holly had  <br/>\n&gt; said yes, about drinking, so they told her to call her parents.  And  <br/>\n&gt; Holly didn&#39;t know the other girl, nor several of the people at the  <br/>\n&gt; party.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The birthday hostess (not resident) had wanted to stay with Holly but  <br/>\n&gt; the police told her she needed to leave and help get the intoxicated  <br/>\n&gt; friends safely home.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Marty (20, her brother) had been willing to go and get Holly, but I  <br/>\n&gt; told him it needed to be a parent and we were already on the way.  So  <br/>\n&gt; he said he and Ashlee-his-girlfriend would go on to our house.  I told  <br/>\n&gt; him Brett didn&#39;t know yet, so maybe not to bother him with it but let  <br/>\n&gt; Holly tell him, unless he asked directly.  I thought he was asleep.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just a minute or so later, Brett  (25, her boyfriend) called.  It was  <br/>\n&gt; 2:40 or so by then, and he had been just about to go to sleep but  <br/>\n&gt; called Holly to see if she was okay and when she was coming back.    <br/>\n&gt; The police let her answer the phone.  She told him we were on our way  <br/>\n&gt; to get her, so I told him what I knew and that Marty was on his way  <br/>\n&gt; home.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At that point I thought how cool it was that we were all in such close  <br/>\n&gt; communication.  The day I was in an accident a couple or three weeks  <br/>\n&gt; ago, before I had left the scene, Keith and Holly and Brett were there  <br/>\n&gt; with me.    Marty was at work, or he probably would&#39;ve been there too.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We got to the house and she was sitting on the porch, chocolate  <br/>\n&gt; pudding in her hair and everywhere, drying.  There were four  <br/>\n&gt; policemen, and another one in the house.   Holly was the last one  <br/>\n&gt; there besides the two who lived there. She was wearing a t-shirt and  <br/>\n&gt; shorts, and was barefooted.  I wrapped the flannel sheet around her.   <br/>\n&gt; Keith did the talking, and not much.  Everyone was courteous and  <br/>\n&gt; somber but not tense.  Keith apologized and thanked them, and the one  <br/>\n&gt; who was in charge of Holly before we got there  said they were just  <br/>\n&gt; doing their jobs, and Keith said &quot;Well, I need to do mine too,&quot; and  <br/>\n&gt; the guy said he was a parent too, and these things happen.   So there  <br/>\n&gt; was no shaming or defensiveness or anything.   She was cited, and I  <br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t read the details on our copy, but I think it&#39;s possession of  <br/>\n&gt; alcohol by a minor.  Maybe it&#39;s consumption. It has a number I can&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; see well enough to look it up.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Holly asked if she could go inside and go to the bathroom.  The  <br/>\n&gt; officer said &quot;You&#39;re in the custody of your parents now--it&#39;s up to  <br/>\n&gt; them.&quot;  We all looked at each other.  It wasn&#39;t my house; I didn&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; know the residents.  Keith said &quot;Go pee.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; While she was gone we talked a little.  There was a big dark smear on  <br/>\n&gt; the bottom concrete step there by the front door.  I said &quot;I assume  <br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s pudding, and not blood.&quot;  One of the cops said, &quot;Yeah.  There&#39;s  <br/>\n&gt; pudding everywhere in there.    There&#39;s pudding on me.&quot;  Another one  <br/>\n&gt; said &quot;There&#39;s pudding on my flashlight.&quot;    It would&#39;ve been funny,  <br/>\n&gt; but we were all in straight-face, this isn&#39;t funny mode.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We&#39;ll be contacted by the juvenile probation department.  The  <br/>\n&gt; policeman used the term &quot;intake,&quot; and I asked what that meant.  He  <br/>\n&gt; said they&#39;ll want to determine whether she needs alcohol abuse  <br/>\n&gt; treatment, and whether she&#39;s in a safe situation.  Okay.    I don&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; think homeschooling will be an issue, and she&#39;s old enough to drop out  <br/>\n&gt; or graduate anyway, if she were in high school.   She has two part- <br/>\n&gt; time jobs, and that will help (if they don&#39;t pull a child labor law  <br/>\n&gt; trick out of the hat &lt;g&gt;).   She hasn&#39;t been in trouble, and that will  <br/>\n&gt; help.  No damage to people or property.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And the drinking she did was one jello shooter, and tastes of two  <br/>\n&gt; other people&#39;s drinks.  She said she never had a drink of her own.  <br/>\n&gt; There weren&#39;t any drinking games.  There were people there not  <br/>\n&gt; drinking at all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She could have lied, but she didn&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When she came out of the house she was crying--frustration and  <br/>\n&gt; embarrassment kind of crying.  Stress.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Things seemed to be a smooth as possible under the circumstances.    <br/>\n&gt; When we were leaving, the police could leave, and the two guys who  <br/>\n&gt; lived there walked them out too, and said good night and thanks and  <br/>\n&gt; good bye, and Holly rode back with Keith in the van where the heater  <br/>\n&gt; had been on, and I followed them back in the car.  When we got home  <br/>\n&gt; she was crying, but I do know she told Keith some of the story on the  <br/>\n&gt; way home and also talked to the birthday hostess to tell her she was  <br/>\n&gt; okay.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We got home and she went into the shower.  I took the pudding clothes  <br/>\n&gt; and put them in the washing machine so I could turn it on right after  <br/>\n&gt; she turned the shower off.  The laundry was her bikini top, the  <br/>\n&gt; Punisher t-shirt her friend Jared had taken off and put on her so  <br/>\n&gt; she&#39;d be wearing more than just a bikini top and shorts, another t- <br/>\n&gt; shirt someone had offered up for people to wipe jello off of them, and  <br/>\n&gt; she said she would bring back clean.   Her shorts and underwear, and  <br/>\n&gt; the sheet.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She was unsettled and lightly agitated.  I offered to sleep with her  <br/>\n&gt; in the library and she gratefully took me up on that.   I closed down  <br/>\n&gt; the house, re-ran the laundry, left notes so Keith and Brett would  <br/>\n&gt; know where we were if they woke up, and went and fixed up that bed.   <br/>\n&gt; So I curled up behind her and stroked her hair and her arm and told  <br/>\n&gt; her I loved her and I was sorry she had cried, and she asked what I  <br/>\n&gt; was thinking about it all, and how much trouble she might be in.    I  <br/>\n&gt; told her there might be a fine, and she&#39;d probably have unsupervised  <br/>\n&gt; probation, since nobody was hurt and there wasn&#39;t any malice.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know who all might&#39;ve been charged besides Holly and the  <br/>\n&gt; resident hosts.  I&#39;m willing to provide follow-ups on this.  If I&#39;m  <br/>\n&gt; going to be telling how wonderful our lives are, it&#39;s only fair to  <br/>\n&gt; give some detail on the less than wonderful times.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ashlee (now 23) told me last night that when she was 15 she spent the  <br/>\n&gt; night with a friend, and they got a ride to a party on the other end  <br/>\n&gt; of town.  She grew up 20 miles north of here in Bernalillo, a little  <br/>\n&gt; farm town two miles long.     The girls were walking home from the  <br/>\n&gt; party, really late, and the police came and took each of them to her  <br/>\n&gt; own home.  Ashlee&#39;s parents grounded her from watching MTV for a year,  <br/>\n&gt; she said, because they were sure watching MTV had made her wild.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We&#39;re not grounding Holly from anything.   We didn&#39;t congratulate her  <br/>\n&gt; or make light of it, but she was fully remorseful and is more  <br/>\n&gt; concerned about how we feel about it, and the inconvenience to us in  <br/>\n&gt; the middle of the night,  than about her own outcome.  She&#39;ll be 18 in  <br/>\n&gt; November, and juvenile offenses like this are wiped off, in New  <br/>\n&gt; Mexico.  Or maybe it will be wiped when she&#39;s 21, or after the  <br/>\n&gt; probationary period; I don&#39;t know.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The police seemed to have felt better after they asked Holly whether  <br/>\n&gt; any of the girls were pudding-wrestling for money.    Holly didn&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; really understand the question, and I didn&#39;t even hear about it until  <br/>\n&gt; later, but it makes more sense now, thinking back to when the youngest  <br/>\n&gt; officer said &quot;It was a party activity,&quot; and I said &quot;Well I guess it&#39;s  <br/>\n&gt; good it wasn&#39;t just her and one other girl,&quot; and he said &quot;No, they  <br/>\n&gt; were all doing it.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Keith says guys pay money to watch girls wrestle, so they were  <br/>\n&gt; wondering whether it was a sex show or prostitution.  Oh, see?  I  <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t even think about that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One more story for now...  She said she was the last one up the stairs  <br/>\n&gt; (the pudding pool was in the basement) and they had told all the girls  <br/>\n&gt; to sit on the couch.  Most had showered, but the line for the shower  <br/>\n&gt; had been long, so Holly was still in the wading pool of pudding.    <br/>\n&gt; When she got up there, the resident host was in handcuffs, but once  <br/>\n&gt; they&#39;d figured out the small extent of the problem, they took them  <br/>\n&gt; off.  But she said she asked if she could sit on the floor instead  <br/>\n&gt; because she had pudding on her.

She was having fun.<br/>\nPudding-wrestling...how fun does that sound?? I may suggest it at my kids&#39;<br/>\nnext party...<br/>\n<br/>\nI have three teenagers and one 20 year old (15, 17, 19, 20). I haven&#39;t told<br/>\nthe stories on here that weren&#39;t so pretty. I really admire your honesty.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have been to parties with alcohol and pot. Three have tried pot.<br/>\nThey&#39;ve had parties at our house where alcohol showed up. Some of their<br/>\nfriends smoke cigarettes. One of mine smokes cigarettes on occasion. And we<br/>\nhave two hookahs here. They are used about twice a month in a quiet social<br/>\nsetting. Sometimes they aren&#39;t used for months at a time (and I don&#39;t worry<br/>\nabout sheesha...they get the compressed fruit kind that is tobacco-free, and<br/>\nit doesn&#39;t create smoke in the house).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut none of my kids are &quot;into&quot; pot, alcohol, cigarettes or drugs. Those are<br/>\nminor items in the array of many more interesting things in life. They talk<br/>\nopenly about drugs and alcohol. They prefer to be home much of their spare<br/>\ntime.They seem to be gliding through these &quot;troublesome&quot; years. They are<br/>\nauthentically kind, listen well to people, open doors for others at the<br/>\ngrocery store, are openly thankful for things...they are good, good people.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut they have a variety of friends and go to a variety of places, so they<br/>\nare as susceptible as the next kid to being arrested, detained or any other<br/>\nlegal situation. I know this when they are out, and I trust that they will<br/>\ndo their best in situations, but I could just as easily receive a call from<br/>\nthe police, not because I think my kids are regular law-breakers, but<br/>\nbecause our society is set up that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs the demon that young adults are engaging in these things in life, or is<br/>\nthe demon that we make it illegal?<br/>\n<br/>\nBravo to you and Holly and your family for being so supportive of each<br/>\nother. It was really a beautiful story. And I&#39;m sure it will produce laughs<br/>\nlater on. Maybe not now, but later. It isn&#39;t something to be ashamed of,<br/>\nthat&#39;s for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for sharing,<br/>\nJacki<br/>\n<br/>\n  Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>]On Behalf Of Sandra Dodd<br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, April 26, 2009 10:27 AM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] I&#39;ll tell this here, but not on my blog<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  This is long, but everyone&#39;s fine. Those with young children or who<br/>\n  don&#39;t like long posts can skip it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My introduction is that each of our children has been in trouble with<br/>\n  the law now.<br/>\n  Kirby drove his friend Joey home about four blocks, and he forgot to<br/>\n  turn his headlights on. We went to court and they let him pay the<br/>\n  fine without talking to the judge.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Marty was on a playground in a public park after hours (parks close at<br/>\n  10:00 or 10:30)--not drinking, not doing anything but playing on the<br/>\n  slides with three other people, one 21 and the others 18, 19. He did<br/>\n  two days of community service at the Red Cross office. (He reminded<br/>\n  me that he also was ticketed for stopping too hard at a stop light.<br/>\n  He stopped, but not gracefully, and we went to court and he paid a<br/>\n  fine and went to a driving class. No alcohol nor any other such thing<br/>\n  involved.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Holly&#39;s is slightly worse than these.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Last night at 2:20 Holly (17) called on the house phone. There&#39;s one<br/>\n  by our bed. She sounded like she was afraid and embarrassed, and said<br/>\n  that the party had been busted, and she needed us to come and pick her<br/>\n  up. The police said she needed at least one parent to come. And she<br/>\n  was afraid she might have parked the car where it would have been<br/>\n  towed. She couldn&#39;t see it from where she was.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So I woke Keith up and told him. Keith had fallen asleep really early<br/>\n  because he had been helping clean a group camping site in Edgewood for<br/>\n  several hours Saturday morning and afternoon. Brett had been<br/>\n  planning to go to the party when I had gone to bed, but Brett had had<br/>\n  a too-long day at work and had come home to discuss that and to play<br/>\n  World of Warcraft. (Brett is Holly&#39;s boyfriend, who&#39;s staying with<br/>\n  us, for those new to the saga.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Brett&#39;s car was in the driveway and the house was dark, so we went out<br/>\n  quietly. I thought maybe he could be spared the worry, and it&#39;s<br/>\n  possible that Holly wouldn&#39;t have wanted him there, but just us.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I went back to get a big flannel sheet, because besides &quot;bust&quot; Holly<br/>\n  had also mentioned &quot;wrestling in pudding.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I knew where she was, because it was a house she&#39;d never been to<br/>\n  before, hosting a party for a couple she&#39;s known separately a long<br/>\n  time, and together. One was having a birthday; the other had<br/>\n  sufficiently recovered from a broken neck in a car accident (he&#39;s<br/>\n  mobile), to share a party. She had been scheduled to go to his<br/>\n  birthday party a couple of months ago when he had the accident.<br/>\n  Brett and I had helped (by phone) figure out exactly where the house<br/>\n  was and how she could best get there from where she was after work.<br/>\n<br/>\n  For those who know Albuquerque, we&#39;re near the mountains (Juan Tabo<br/>\n  and Candelaria) and she was down past the university, across from<br/>\n  Roosevelt Park. It&#39;s eight miles or ten, maybe.<br/>\n<br/>\n  As we were driving, we discussed what the best tack to take would be.<br/>\n  We shouldn&#39;t be too cheery about it. We weren&#39;t going to act harsher<br/>\n  than we felt. I was thinking at that time it might be a marijuana<br/>\n  situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n  A mile from the house Marty called. He had been invited to the party,<br/>\n  but had opted to go to a couple of parties his girlfriend had been<br/>\n  invited to instead. They were done there, and he had called to see<br/>\n  if the birthday/recovery party was still on, and the birthday-person<br/>\n  answered her cell from her car, where she was driving drunks home.<br/>\n  She told Marty what she knew. So I was relieved it was alcohol and<br/>\n  pudding, rather than drugs.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Holly had been the second youngest person at the party. The sixteen<br/>\n  year old girl was asked &quot;were you drinking?&quot; and she said &quot;no,&quot; so<br/>\n  they said &quot;Go home.&quot; Everyone over 21 who could prove it was told<br/>\n  to go home. (Holly&#39;s unsure if any of them got citations). Holly had<br/>\n  said yes, about drinking, so they told her to call her parents. And<br/>\n  Holly didn&#39;t know the other girl, nor several of the people at the<br/>\n  party.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The birthday hostess (not resident) had wanted to stay with Holly but<br/>\n  the police told her she needed to leave and help get the intoxicated<br/>\n  friends safely home.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Marty (20, her brother) had been willing to go and get Holly, but I<br/>\n  told him it needed to be a parent and we were already on the way. So<br/>\n  he said he and Ashlee-his-girlfriend would go on to our house. I told<br/>\n  him Brett didn&#39;t know yet, so maybe not to bother him with it but let<br/>\n  Holly tell him, unless he asked directly. I thought he was asleep.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Just a minute or so later, Brett (25, her boyfriend) called. It was<br/>\n  2:40 or so by then, and he had been just about to go to sleep but<br/>\n  called Holly to see if she was okay and when she was coming back.<br/>\n  The police let her answer the phone. She told him we were on our way<br/>\n  to get her, so I told him what I knew and that Marty was on his way<br/>\n  home.<br/>\n<br/>\n  At that point I thought how cool it was that we were all in such close<br/>\n  communication. The day I was in an accident a couple or three weeks<br/>\n  ago, before I had left the scene, Keith and Holly and Brett were there<br/>\n  with me. Marty was at work, or he probably would&#39;ve been there too.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We got to the house and she was sitting on the porch, chocolate<br/>\n  pudding in her hair and everywhere, drying. There were four<br/>\n  policemen, and another one in the house. Holly was the last one<br/>\n  there besides the two who lived there. She was wearing a t-shirt and<br/>\n  shorts, and was barefooted. I wrapped the flannel sheet around her.<br/>\n  Keith did the talking, and not much. Everyone was courteous and<br/>\n  somber but not tense. Keith apologized and thanked them, and the one<br/>\n  who was in charge of Holly before we got there said they were just<br/>\n  doing their jobs, and Keith said &quot;Well, I need to do mine too,&quot; and<br/>\n  the guy said he was a parent too, and these things happen. So there<br/>\n  was no shaming or defensiveness or anything. She was cited, and I<br/>\n  can&#39;t read the details on our copy, but I think it&#39;s possession of<br/>\n  alcohol by a minor. Maybe it&#39;s consumption. It has a number I can&#39;t<br/>\n  see well enough to look it up.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Holly asked if she could go inside and go to the bathroom. The<br/>\n  officer said &quot;You&#39;re in the custody of your parents now--it&#39;s up to<br/>\n  them.&quot; We all looked at each other. It wasn&#39;t my house; I didn&#39;t<br/>\n  know the residents. Keith said &quot;Go pee.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  While she was gone we talked a little. There was a big dark smear on<br/>\n  the bottom concrete step there by the front door. I said &quot;I assume<br/>\n  that&#39;s pudding, and not blood.&quot; One of the cops said, &quot;Yeah. There&#39;s<br/>\n  pudding everywhere in there. There&#39;s pudding on me.&quot; Another one<br/>\n  said &quot;There&#39;s pudding on my flashlight.&quot; It would&#39;ve been funny,<br/>\n  but we were all in straight-face, this isn&#39;t funny mode.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We&#39;ll be contacted by the juvenile probation department. The<br/>\n  policeman used the term &quot;intake,&quot; and I asked what that meant. He<br/>\n  said they&#39;ll want to determine whether she needs alcohol abuse<br/>\n  treatment, and whether she&#39;s in a safe situation. Okay. I don&#39;t<br/>\n  think homeschooling will be an issue, and she&#39;s old enough to drop out<br/>\n  or graduate anyway, if she were in high school. She has two part-<br/>\n  time jobs, and that will help (if they don&#39;t pull a child labor law<br/>\n  trick out of the hat &lt;g&gt;). She hasn&#39;t been in trouble, and that will<br/>\n  help. No damage to people or property.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And the drinking she did was one jello shooter, and tastes of two<br/>\n  other people&#39;s drinks. She said she never had a drink of her own.<br/>\n  There weren&#39;t any drinking games. There were people there not<br/>\n  drinking at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n  She could have lied, but she didn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n  When she came out of the house she was crying--frustration and<br/>\n  embarrassment kind of crying. Stress.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Things seemed to be a smooth as possible under the circumstances.<br/>\n  When we were leaving, the police could leave, and the two guys who<br/>\n  lived there walked them out too, and said good night and thanks and<br/>\n  good bye, and Holly rode back with Keith in the van where the heater<br/>\n  had been on, and I followed them back in the car. When we got home<br/>\n  she was crying, but I do know she told Keith some of the story on the<br/>\n  way home and also talked to the birthday hostess to tell her she was<br/>\n  okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We got home and she went into the shower. I took the pudding clothes<br/>\n  and put them in the washing machine so I could turn it on right after<br/>\n  she turned the shower off. The laundry was her bikini top, the<br/>\n  Punisher t-shirt her friend Jared had taken off and put on her so<br/>\n  she&#39;d be wearing more than just a bikini top and shorts, another t-<br/>\n  shirt someone had offered up for people to wipe jello off of them, and<br/>\n  she said she would bring back clean. Her shorts and underwear, and<br/>\n  the sheet.<br/>\n<br/>\n  She was unsettled and lightly agitated. I offered to sleep with her<br/>\n  in the library and she gratefully took me up on that. I closed down<br/>\n  the house, re-ran the laundry, left notes so Keith and Brett would<br/>\n  know where we were if they woke up, and went and fixed up that bed.<br/>\n  So I curled up behind her and stroked her hair and her arm and told<br/>\n  her I loved her and I was sorry she had cried, and she asked what I<br/>\n  was thinking about it all, and how much trouble she might be in. I<br/>\n  told her there might be a fine, and she&#39;d probably have unsupervised<br/>\n  probation, since nobody was hurt and there wasn&#39;t any malice.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t know who all might&#39;ve been charged besides Holly and the<br/>\n  resident hosts. I&#39;m willing to provide follow-ups on this. If I&#39;m<br/>\n  going to be telling how wonderful our lives are, it&#39;s only fair to<br/>\n  give some detail on the less than wonderful times.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ashlee (now 23) told me last night that when she was 15 she spent the<br/>\n  night with a friend, and they got a ride to a party on the other end<br/>\n  of town. She grew up 20 miles north of here in Bernalillo, a little<br/>\n  farm town two miles long. The girls were walking home from the<br/>\n  party, really late, and the police came and took each of them to her<br/>\n  own home. Ashlee&#39;s parents grounded her from watching MTV for a year,<br/>\n  she said, because they were sure watching MTV had made her wild.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We&#39;re not grounding Holly from anything.

She was honest, she was considerate of her host&#39;s furniture,<br/>\n  she had had a jello shot (not at all strong, either, she said) and a<br/>\n  couple of drinks of others&#39; mixed drinks.

Those with young children or who  <br/>\ndon&#39;t like long posts can skip it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy introduction is that each of our children has been in trouble with  <br/>\nthe law now.<br/>\nKirby drove his friend Joey home about four blocks, and he forgot to  <br/>\nturn his headlights on.  We went to court and they let him pay the  <br/>\nfine without talking to the judge.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty was on a playground in a public park after hours (parks close at  <br/>\n10:00 or 10:30)--not drinking, not doing anything but playing on the  <br/>\nslides with three other people, one 21 and the others 18, 19.  He did  <br/>\ntwo days of community service at the Red Cross office.  (He reminded  <br/>\nme that he also was ticketed for stopping too hard at a stop light.   <br/>\nHe stopped, but not gracefully, and we went to court and he paid a  <br/>\nfine and went to a driving class.  No alcohol nor any other such thing  <br/>\ninvolved.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly&#39;s is slightly worse than these.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night at 2:20 Holly (17) called on the house phone.  There&#39;s one  <br/>\nby our bed.  She sounded like she was afraid and embarrassed, and said  <br/>\nthat the party had been busted, and she needed us to come and pick her  <br/>\nup.  The police said she needed at least one parent to come.  And she  <br/>\nwas afraid she might have parked the car where it would have been  <br/>\ntowed.  She couldn&#39;t see it from where she was.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I woke Keith up and told him.  Keith had fallen asleep really early  <br/>\nbecause he had been helping clean a group camping site in Edgewood for  <br/>\nseveral hours Saturday morning and afternoon.   Brett had been  <br/>\nplanning to go to the party when I had gone to bed, but Brett had had  <br/>\na too-long day at work and had come home to discuss that and to play  <br/>\nWorld of Warcraft.  (Brett is Holly&#39;s boyfriend, who&#39;s staying with  <br/>\nus, for those new to the saga.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBrett&#39;s car was in the driveway and the house was dark, so we went out  <br/>\nquietly.  I thought maybe he could be spared the worry, and it&#39;s  <br/>\npossible that Holly wouldn&#39;t have wanted him there, but just us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went back to get a big flannel sheet, because besides  &quot;bust&quot; Holly  <br/>\nhad also mentioned &quot;wrestling in pudding.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI knew where she was, because it was a house she&#39;d never been to  <br/>\nbefore, hosting a party for a couple she&#39;s known separately a long  <br/>\ntime, and together.  One was having a birthday; the other had  <br/>\nsufficiently recovered from a broken neck in a car accident (he&#39;s  <br/>\nmobile), to share a party.  She had been scheduled to go to his  <br/>\nbirthday party a couple of months ago when he had the accident.    <br/>\nBrett and I had helped (by phone) figure out exactly where the house  <br/>\nwas and how she could best get there from where she was after work.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who know Albuquerque, we&#39;re near the mountains (Juan Tabo  <br/>\nand Candelaria) and she was down past the university, across from  <br/>\nRoosevelt Park.  It&#39;s eight miles or ten, maybe.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs we were driving, we discussed what the best tack to take would be.   <br/>\nWe shouldn&#39;t be too cheery about it.  We weren&#39;t going to act harsher  <br/>\nthan we felt.  I was thinking at that time it might be a marijuana  <br/>\nsituation.<br/>\n<br/>\nA mile from the house Marty called.  He had been invited to the party,  <br/>\nbut had opted to go to a couple of parties his girlfriend had been  <br/>\ninvited to instead.   They were done there, and he had called to see  <br/>\nif the birthday/recovery party was still on, and the birthday-person  <br/>\nanswered her cell from her car, where she was driving drunks home.    <br/>\nShe told Marty what she knew.  So I was relieved it was alcohol and  <br/>\npudding, rather than drugs.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly had been the second youngest person at the party.   The sixteen  <br/>\nyear old girl was asked &quot;were you drinking?&quot; and she said &quot;no,&quot; so  <br/>\nthey said &quot;Go home.&quot;    Everyone over 21 who could prove it was told  <br/>\nto go home.  (Holly&#39;s unsure if any of them got citations).  Holly had  <br/>\nsaid yes, about drinking, so they told her to call her parents.  And  <br/>\nHolly didn&#39;t know the other girl, nor several of the people at the  <br/>\nparty.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe birthday hostess (not resident) had wanted to stay with Holly but  <br/>\nthe police told her she needed to leave and help get the intoxicated  <br/>\nfriends safely home.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty (20, her brother) had been willing to go and get Holly, but I  <br/>\ntold him it needed to be a parent and we were already on the way.  So  <br/>\nhe said he and Ashlee-his-girlfriend would go on to our house.  I told  <br/>\nhim Brett didn&#39;t know yet, so maybe not to bother him with it but let  <br/>\nHolly tell him, unless he asked directly.  I thought he was asleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a minute or so later, Brett  (25, her boyfriend) called.  It was  <br/>\n2:40 or so by then, and he had been just about to go to sleep but  <br/>\ncalled Holly to see if she was okay and when she was coming back.    <br/>\nThe police let her answer the phone.  She told him we were on our way  <br/>\nto get her, so I told him what I knew and that Marty was on his way  <br/>\nhome.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt that point I thought how cool it was that we were all in such close  <br/>\ncommunication.  The day I was in an accident a couple or three weeks  <br/>\nago, before I had left the scene, Keith and Holly and Brett were there  <br/>\nwith me.    Marty was at work, or he probably would&#39;ve been there too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got to the house and she was sitting on the porch, chocolate  <br/>\npudding in her hair and everywhere, drying.  There were four  <br/>\npolicemen, and another one in the house.   Holly was the last one  <br/>\nthere besides the two who lived there. She was wearing a t-shirt and  <br/>\nshorts, and was barefooted.  I wrapped the flannel sheet around her.   <br/>\nKeith did the talking, and not much.  Everyone was courteous and  <br/>\nsomber but not tense.  Keith apologized and thanked them, and the one  <br/>\nwho was in charge of Holly before we got there  said they were just  <br/>\ndoing their jobs, and Keith said &quot;Well, I need to do mine too,&quot; and  <br/>\nthe guy said he was a parent too, and these things happen.   So there  <br/>\nwas no shaming or defensiveness or anything.   She was cited, and I  <br/>\ncan&#39;t read the details on our copy, but I think it&#39;s possession of  <br/>\nalcohol by a minor.  Maybe it&#39;s consumption. It has a number I can&#39;t  <br/>\nsee well enough to look it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly asked if she could go inside and go to the bathroom.  The  <br/>\nofficer said &quot;You&#39;re in the custody of your parents now--it&#39;s up to  <br/>\nthem.&quot;  We all looked at each other.  It wasn&#39;t my house; I didn&#39;t  <br/>\nknow the residents.  Keith said &quot;Go pee.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile she was gone we talked a little.  There was a big dark smear on  <br/>\nthe bottom concrete step there by the front door.  I said &quot;I assume  <br/>\nthat&#39;s pudding, and not blood.&quot;  One of the cops said, &quot;Yeah.  There&#39;s  <br/>\npudding everywhere in there.    There&#39;s pudding on me.&quot;  Another one  <br/>\nsaid &quot;There&#39;s pudding on my flashlight.&quot;    It would&#39;ve been funny,  <br/>\nbut we were all in straight-face, this isn&#39;t funny mode.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ll be contacted by the juvenile probation department.  The  <br/>\npoliceman used the term &quot;intake,&quot; and I asked what that meant.  He  <br/>\nsaid they&#39;ll want to determine whether she needs alcohol abuse  <br/>\ntreatment, and whether she&#39;s in a safe situation.  Okay.    I don&#39;t  <br/>\nthink homeschooling will be an issue, and she&#39;s old enough to drop out  <br/>\nor graduate anyway, if she were in high school.   She has two part- <br/>\ntime jobs, and that will help (if they don&#39;t pull a child labor law  <br/>\ntrick out of the hat &lt;g&gt;).   She hasn&#39;t been in trouble, and that will  <br/>\nhelp.  No damage to people or property.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the drinking she did was one jello shooter, and tastes of two  <br/>\nother people&#39;s drinks.  She said she never had a drink of her own.  <br/>\nThere weren&#39;t any drinking games.  There were people there not  <br/>\ndrinking at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe could have lied, but she didn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she came out of the house she was crying--frustration and  <br/>\nembarrassment kind of crying.  Stress.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings seemed to be a smooth as possible under the circumstances.    <br/>\nWhen we were leaving, the police could leave, and the two guys who  <br/>\nlived there walked them out too, and said good night and thanks and  <br/>\ngood bye, and Holly rode back with Keith in the van where the heater  <br/>\nhad been on, and I followed them back in the car.  When we got home  <br/>\nshe was crying, but I do know she told Keith some of the story on the  <br/>\nway home and also talked to the birthday hostess to tell her she was  <br/>\nokay.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got home and she went into the shower.  I took the pudding clothes  <br/>\nand put them in the washing machine so I could turn it on right after  <br/>\nshe turned the shower off.  The laundry was her bikini top, the  <br/>\nPunisher t-shirt her friend Jared had taken off and put on her so  <br/>\nshe&#39;d be wearing more than just a bikini top and shorts, another t- <br/>\nshirt someone had offered up for people to wipe jello off of them, and  <br/>\nshe said she would bring back clean.   Her shorts and underwear, and  <br/>\nthe sheet.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was unsettled and lightly agitated.  I offered to sleep with her  <br/>\nin the library and she gratefully took me up on that.   I closed down  <br/>\nthe house, re-ran the laundry, left notes so Keith and Brett would  <br/>\nknow where we were if they woke up, and went and fixed up that bed.   <br/>\nSo I curled up behind her and stroked her hair and her arm and told  <br/>\nher I loved her and I was sorry she had cried, and she asked what I  <br/>\nwas thinking about it all, and how much trouble she might be in.    I  <br/>\ntold her there might be a fine, and she&#39;d probably have unsupervised  <br/>\nprobation, since nobody was hurt and there wasn&#39;t any malice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know who all might&#39;ve been charged besides Holly and the  <br/>\nresident hosts.  I&#39;m willing to provide follow-ups on this.  If I&#39;m  <br/>\ngoing to be telling how wonderful our lives are, it&#39;s only fair to  <br/>\ngive some detail on the less than wonderful times.<br/>\n<br/>\nAshlee (now 23) told me last night that when she was 15 she spent the  <br/>\nnight with a friend, and they got a ride to a party on the other end  <br/>\nof town.  She grew up 20 miles north of here in Bernalillo, a little  <br/>\nfarm town two miles long.     The girls were walking home from the  <br/>\nparty, really late, and the police came and took each of them to her  <br/>\nown home.  Ashlee&#39;s parents grounded her from watching MTV for a year,  <br/>\nshe said, because they were sure watching MTV had made her wild.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re not grounding Holly from anything.   We didn&#39;t congratulate her  <br/>\nor make light of it, but she was fully remorseful and is more  <br/>\nconcerned about how we feel about it, and the inconvenience to us in  <br/>\nthe middle of the night,  than about her own outcome.
