Schuyler Waynforth, and her husband David will be at these places too (some or all of them), and other unschoolers and autonomous ed families I don&#39;t know of yet.  And Julie Daniel. And Helene McNeill (American friend, in France this year, resident in the UK for six or seven years a while back) whose two younger kids are in school this year to learn more French, but were never in school before.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis schedule is rough.  Tentative.  Nothing certain yet.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t put it on a calendar; don&#39;t take it to the bank.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt looks like I&#39;ll be in Edinburgh from about the 20th or 21st of May, for a while.  There will be at least one announced gathering, and people on lists in Scotland will get that, when the dates are firm and for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will be speaking at a conference in London.  It will probably be June 25-26, but might be June 18-19.  Others will speak too.  Schuyler and David, I hope.  Others I can&#39;t name yet because they&#39;re not confirmed, but all the others are (as David is) Brit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the conference, I&#39;ll be in France for four or five days, with David and Schuyler and their kids Simon and Linnaea.  Anyone who wants to go there at the same time is welcome to camp on the five-acre property where my friends Helene and Leon McNeill are living in Baud, in Brittany/Bretagne.  Their oldest daughter, Jasmine, might be visiting then (she&#39;s attending the University of New Mexico and so didn&#39;t move to France on this temporary move).  The younger kids are Darwin and Sophie.  They have room for 30 tents, and there&#39;s a river people could potentially fish in.<br/>\n<br/>\nVarious other times I will be in Darby, Sheffield, Bristol, north Wales (Connah&#39;s Qay, Conwy or both), Londonderry, and maybe another couple of places more briefly.  I don&#39;t know whether there will be &quot;gatherings&quot; there, but people near there who can&#39;t attend any of the main things (Edinburgh, London, Baud) should let me know on the side and I&#39;ll see if I can get you an invite or meeting time at a pub lunch or some such, at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had mentioned HESFES at one point a while back, but I&#39;ll be back in the U.S. by then.  <br/>\n<br/>\nALL tentative, as to dates and the order of things, but being firmed up within a week or so.  I&#39;ll put the notes here when it&#39;s more sure:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com\">http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":393776762,"authorName":"jumping.higher@rocketmail.com","from":"&quot;jumping.higher@...&quot; &lt;jumping.higher@...&gt;","profile":"jumping.higher@rocketmail.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Conference in the UK","postDate":"1295204729","msgId":58968,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlndmZocCs5czk1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDA5MjVENkQ0LURGQ0MtNDNCMS04RDA3LUJEMTIyNTNDNUUyOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":58816,"nextInTopic":58972,"prevInTime":58967,"nextInTime":58969,"topicId":58788,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello everyone I am very happy there will be a one day conference this year!

Usually in our lives (speaking for school kids, as I was), understanding means being able to recite back, or to answer multiple choice questions, or to summarize.
