But I will spare you. Because weknow they are just words. (or rather, I care a lot about words, as awriter, so what I really mean is &quot;excuses.&quot;).&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are wavering back and forth so much to this question, then you already know the answer. You should ask him what he would like to do and if he wants to be pulled out now, then you should do it. Please do not force him to go to school for 3 more months just so you can say that he completed it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know this is the right thing to do from experience. My middle child started homeschooling in the beginning of what would have been his 5th grade school year. He went to school for 2 months of 5th grade before I got wise (after much research and reading about homeschooling) and pulled him out. I homeschooled him that year (we lived in NC at the time). My oldest daughter continued in public middle school as that is what she wanted. My youngest daughter was too young to even think about school or homeschool (we hadn&#39;t learned about unschooling yet). <br/>\n<br/>\nWe moved back to our hometown in Ohio the next year. I was not clear on Ohio laws about homeschooling. I thought that there was more involved as far as notification and having to report everything we did so I chose to enroll my son in an online public cyber school. (I have since read the Ohio Homeschooling laws very completely.) He went to this cyber school for 3 years. He liked it better than going to actual public school but still hated certain aspects of it. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest daughter finally decided that she wanted to go to the cyber school too when she was half way through her 10th grade public school year. I pulled her out and enrolled her in the cyber school as well. In the meantime, my youngest daughter had started kindergarten and then went on to first grade at the local public elementary school. She hated it (for the most part).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I look back now, I realize that I made the decision to pull my older two children out of public school much easier than I did my youngest. I think that was because I knew that the older two had learned what I refer to as &quot;the basics&quot;, reading, writing, and basic math. I knew that my youngest hated school but I was afraid that I would not be able to teach her &quot;the basics&quot;. It wasn&#39;t until I found unschooling that I realized that I wasn&#39;t supposed to &quot;teach&quot; her anything, and that she was learning all of the time. But I was still scared. Was I doing the right thing? What would my family and friends think? My thinking wavered back and forth for the whole summer before she was supposed to start 2nd grade.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went ahead and pulled my oldest two out of the cyber school. I sent our superintendent the homeschooling notification for them. But I was still very afraid to make the move to pull my youngest daughter out. We went to the 2nd grade open house the week before school began to meet her teacher. I bought all of the school supplies. I still wasn&#39;t convinced that I was doing the right thing but I wasn&#39;t sure enough to make the leap to what I knew would ultimately be best for her. She went to the first day of 2nd grade. She hated it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI typed up the homeschooling notification letter that night to our superintendent and put it in the mail the next day. I called the school&#39;s attendance line and left a message that my daughter would not be returning to school because we had decided to homeschool. I did NOT make my daughter go back the next day or until I got the letter of approval from the superintendent. I haven&#39;t had any problem. I received his letter about 2 to 3 weeks later. I&#39;ve never had any one question me about not having her go back. And you know what, I finally realized that I made the right decision. It&#39;s been the best decision that I&#39;ve made.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, I made some of my family members mad but they are coming around. My sister didn&#39;t talk to me for weeks (she&#39;s attending college to get her Master&#39;s in Education, go figure, lol). My mom still asks me questions about reading and writing. My friends still say things like &quot;aren&#39;t you studying with her at that time?&quot; when I&#39;ve already explained to them that we don&#39;t have a curriculum. But one thing that sticks in my head the most is when I hear people on this list saying &quot;do you care more about what others think than what your own children think?&quot;.

We met them at last years Life Is Good Conference.  Nice family, all of them.  That conference was in May, and they all made the choice to finish off the year.  In hindsight, and it&#39;s almost a year later, they wonder why they did that.  It seems really meaningless after you&#39;ve taken the plunge and finally done it, all those reasons one stayed instead of just jumping in.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of people all over the internet can give people good reasons for keeping a kid in school and justifying those reasons!  I&#39;d like to think that on an unschooling list, all of us can find good reasons to take a child out now, especially if that child is having problems or tears or upset.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never met a person who&#39;s left their kids in school and then taken them out, who hasn&#39;t regretted that decision.  The woman who initiated this thread has left the list because we weren&#39;t able to justify her reasons for keeping her son in school for a few more months.  For some reason she targeted me because I pissed her off and she spewed a bunch of ugly to me on the side, like 5 pages worth if I were to print it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I ever piss any of you guys off, by something I&#39;ve written will you please assume good intent behind my words and ask me what I mean.  It will help you to understand where I&#39;m coming from and give me a chance to reword what I&#39;ve said in a way that might make more sense.  It&#39;s good for me to really think about ways to word things, something I try really hard to do in the first place!  Also, I really think that this list is very much a good place to do just that!  Words matter!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat matters to me personally, is living a life that doesn&#39;t involve a ton of regrets.  There are things that I regret from the past that I can&#39;t undo!  Hopefully sharing those things will help others not make the same mistakes!<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62589750,"authorName":"JudithAnneMurphy@aol.com","from":"JudithAnneMurphy@...","profile":"shepherdlass","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Un-lurking","postDate":"1268147326","msgId":51846,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDQzhEQjE4RDBFNTg3My00RkU4LUVFRUJAd2VibWFpbC1kMDM2LnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":51833,"nextInTopic":51857,"prevInTime":51845,"nextInTime":51847,"topicId":51780,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1569118671\">&lt;For anyone for whom this list isn&#39;t helpful, either stop reading or <br/>\n&lt;drop off or something, but posting &quot;this isn&#39;t helpful&quot; isn&#39;t at all <br/>\n&lt;helpful.

So &quot;great&quot; doesn&#39;t necessarily mean out of all the things in the world, they&#39;ve had a great time. It means great relative to the situation he&#39;s stuck in.===<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce nailed it, as usual.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve pulled my daughter out of preschool (after 3 tries at it - and the classes were only 2 hrs long), Kindergarten (after 10 days - 7 of which she missed), and 1st Grade (after 8 days, 7 of which she missed). In between Kindergarten and 1st Grade, she went to Kindergarten for one school year. <br/>\n<br/>\nDuring her first try at Kindergarten she was 5. I had always considered myself as a Mother who tried hard to meet her needs. She has always been a highly-attached, and I knew this whole school thing was going to be tough. But when it became tougher than anything I&#39;d ever experienced as a parent, I really felt like I was lost at sea. I felt so accountable to the schools, the attendance policy, the idea of an attendance board, the juvenile justice system, my friends, my familyif she didn&#39;t go to school what did that say about ME????<br/>\n<br/>\nThankfully, the schools asked me to pull her out.  They suggested that we wait a year, she was young, she could try again the next year. It all sounded like a huge relief to me, so we did.  And then, before the next year was to start, she and I sat down and had a talk about school and whether she wanted to stay home or go to school. She decided she wanted to try Kindergarten again.  So we did.  After about 10 days she decided she didn&#39;t want to go.  Again, I felt all these huge emotions rise up in me. Again, I worried, so I decided I needed to talk to someone with more experience than me (and I hadn&#39;t discovered this list yet).<br/>\n<br/>\nI consulted with Scott Noelle who asked me very simple, straightforward questions that I had been unable to ask myself.  &quot;What is the worst that will happen if she misses days of school?&quot; &quot;If she misses more days than the schools allow, what are your rights?&quot;  &quot;If you honor your daughter&#39;s desire to stay home, what do you think might happen?&quot; So, I began to look at this as a choice.  The day after I had my consultation, she didn&#39;t want to go. I said, okay.  And I left it at that.  The next day she got up and asked to go to school.  She didn&#39;t miss a single day after that, not for the rest of the year. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, it wasn&#39;t exactly easy.  She dropped all her outside activities...dance, gymnastics, choir. She insisted I park in exactly the same place every single day. She refused to walk or ride her bike or scooter even though we only lived blocks away. She refused to let anyone but me drop her off or pick her up. She wanted the exact same snacks and lunch for weeks and weeks on end.  Any little disruption to any piece of her routine caused massive upheaval for her emotionally.  But every day when I picked her up and I asked how things had been, she always said &quot;Great.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nLooking back on all this, I see that she was coping in the best manner that she could. I can see that it&#39;s because I never told her she had a choice beyond that one day. The choice to send her to school or not had been mine momentarily, but once she became the &quot;model student&quot; I abandoned the choice and I never extended that option to her.  Remarkably, when 1st grade rolled around, and I saw the direction the school went making 1st grade &quot;real school with real work and real homework and no play&quot; I knew that this choice would be extended to her. Thankfully, I made it clear from the get go, and when the 2nd week of school pulled around and we had pulled out, we all sighed a huge breath of relief. <br/>\n<br/>\n===while I disagree with the entire coercive paradigm that schooling IS, I don&#39;t think going to this school RIGHT now part-time, for three more months, while I get myself more ready, is a terrible thing. Maybe it is. I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m obviously wavering.===<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you decide to pull your son out, you can still spend 3 or (many) more months getting yourself ready. You will have that many more days spending time with him. It&#39;s not as if you can absorb all the information on these kinds of lists and books, etc. and then suddenly just be &quot;more ready.&quot; What are you expecting to be ready for? Understanding Unschooling and how it will take shape in your life takes time. It takes lots and lots and lots of reading and reflecting. It takes hard work to observe what your brain reacts with, and then to consciously shift your thoughts towards the direction you are moving in. Once I realized that the school itself is what was causing damage to my daughter, the choice became clear. There was no wavering. Ready or not. But the relief we felt was massive and deep.  I think asking your son what he wants is an excellent idea. Maybe what you need to be ready for is his answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristi Beguin</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":37615548,"authorName":"fcgardner","from":"&quot;fcgardner&quot; &lt;fgardner@...&gt;","profile":"fcgardner","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Un-lurking","postDate":"1268089309","msgId":51828,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhuM3ZrdCszcDVqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEVDRUY2QTk4LUFENjMtNDgxMS04ODI2LUVDMkFBNkJBRUVENkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":51823,"nextInTopic":51830,"prevInTime":51827,"nextInTime":51829,"topicId":51780,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m sorry I communicated this badly.

My only point was to add a little nuance to my initial statement that this school is a bad match for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt a different moment I think there&#39;s an interesting conversation to be had about how we interpret &quot;what our kids want&quot; when knowing and communicating wants in general -- even for grownups -- is often a very tough thing to do and understand and that we sometimes articulate contradictory wants (and even have contradictory wants).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are all stumbling towards ecstasy.

At first, they planned for him to finish the term and not go back after the winter holidays. Finishing the term was partly his choice, because he was working on a project he wanted to finish, and he wanted to sing in the choir&#39;s end-of-semester show, and he thought he&#39;d miss his friends and wanted to get as much time as possible with them before he left.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think of the three weeks he planned to continue going to school, he made it two or three days. Not in a row. And with at least a week to go, he just admitted he was done and stopped altogether. Once he had the choice, even the parts of school he had most liked didn&#39;t seem worth going for.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve had something of the same experience when quitting a bad job--giving my two weeks&#39; notice and discovering that in the process I lost whatever defense mechanisms had allowed me to keep it together and keep working there, and that last two weeks just feeling intolerable.

I&#39;ve had terrible gut problems for the last five years developed in part because of post-partum exhaustion and stress and a series of bad gut infections. So getting enough rest and healing and not being able to eat more than a very few kinds of food and working very hard to heal so I can be present for my beautiful son in a better way (and my husband and my stepdaughter) has been a huge part of the last five years. My son has known me a lot as a &quot;sick&quot; mom in addition to being a loving mom and a lot of other good things.

I m a 45","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1930987436\">Hi everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been lurking as a newcomer for the last few days on this list and wanted to step out of the shadows briefly to say thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a 45 year-old mom with a just-turned-six son (as well as beautiful husband and stepdaughter, 16). We&#39;ve decided to embark on the unschooling adventure after our son &quot;graduates&quot; from the montessori kindergarten he&#39;s been in, part-time, for the last two years. While his teacher is wonderful and the school has been very kind to us, it&#39;s consistently not been a good match for him. It&#39;s taken me this long to finally admit that, to SEE it, and to muster up the courage to do something about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause Wes never went to school all five days or all day of the days he did go, we&#39;ve had many many days at home mixed in that I believe to many would LOOK like unschooling. Of course those days happened in a wider context of our making him go to school even over his consistent objections - so obviously not unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nOur parenting has been, to put it mildly, schizophrenic. Wes knows what it&#39;s like to follow his nose all day, to have parents facilitate his curiosity, to attend and respond to where he is at any given moment, to respect his choices (about food, baths, sleeping, TV, etc). And he knows what it&#39;s like to have his parents make him get out of bed and go to school through tears and frustration. I can already feel the exhale in our household at the prospect that that we are going to put down that part of our parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was very influenced in my teens and twenties by democratic and free schooling and by John Holt&#39;s writings, so a lot of the unschooling &quot;principles&quot; that shock or frighten or get bent by mainstream schoolers feel more like home to me. But I hadn&#39;t really visited them up close in the context of unschooling with my own son and in that way I can already feel that the inside of my head is shifting in pretty profound (to me anyway) ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am acutely aware that our journey is going to be much smoother because of all of you who have lovingly and carefully paved the road ahead for us -- from fighting legal battles to nurturing these kinds of communities where we can learn from and support each other. And I think our road will be harder in some ways simply because of who I am and what my limitations are.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra&#39;s BIG BOOK arrived in my mailbox Saturday afternoon and I just finished it this morning. I&#39;ve read a number of unschooling books now and this one was the most food for my soul for where I am right now. I am so grateful for the work Sandra put into it and for all the voices and work of others (from her own children and husband to many of you) gathered therein.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a ton of topics I&#39;d like to raise and hear thoughts on and undoubtedly more as I get more experience under my belt. But for the moment, I will keep lurking and reading and finding my feet.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest to you all,<br/>\n<br/>\nFlorence</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52028,"nextTopicId":51243}}
