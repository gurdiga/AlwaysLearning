It is actually my husband who notices<br/>\nthis.  It happens more when dad is around because my husband doesn&#39;t see the<br/>\npatterns of a leading to b as quickly as Rowan.  In a sense Rowan has been<br/>\n&quot;apprenticing&quot; by being parented a certain way and so when younger children<br/>\nseem stressed, hungry or in danger he has a box of tools.  Rowan&#39;s word<br/>\nchoice, actions and responses inevitably sound like mine--my husband often<br/>\nrolls his eyes and utters &quot;there are two of you&quot; when he is annoyed.  Other<br/>\ntimes John feels good about our parenting choices when Rowan pitches in and<br/>\ndemonstrates calm behaviour in the face of upset younger brothers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you set up shopping as a power struggle it will be one.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the younger boys seem unhappy Rowan offers food, sympathy and asks to<br/>\nhelp-that&#39;s what he&#39;s experienced and seen.  I generally don&#39;t put him in<br/>\nthe position of having to safeguard his siblings.  But my kids are actively<br/>\nshopping with me usually or they do something they enjoy while I shop.  I<br/>\nfound that their tolerance for errands was not necessarily equal to the<br/>\namount of time it takes for the errand.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry this experiment:  follow your friend or partner or kids around for a few<br/>\nhours.  See how long before you get cranky--need to pee, feel tired, feel<br/>\nthirsty or hungry or just want to go home and get back to your needlepoint<br/>\nproject and feel cheated and bored:)<br/>\n<br/>\nMarina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: My son tries to parent my younger kids","postDate":"1319755752","msgId":63628,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGo4Y241OCtlaTB1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PENBUHpaPVY9dUdxQXgtdGNUSHBrWjFUcHRDcmRzbW1ERjJ0WXVkd1hCeUw1V2F3bkZjd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":63615,"nextInTopic":63634,"prevInTime":63627,"nextInTime":63629,"topicId":63605,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It&#39;s pretty normal for an older child, confronted with mom going off the unschooling deep end and obviously (to him or her) neglecting parental responsibilities, to step up and try to help out. See him being helpful and responsible and look for ways to help him do that better - give him suggestions of things to do, rather than &quot;correcting&quot; him with &quot;that&#39;s not how I want to parent&quot;. At the same time, be careful of setting him up to see a vacuum in parenting - unschooling doesn&#39;t necessarily mean letting everything go, it often means being even More engaged with your kids. That might mean looking for ways to take less children to the grocery store at one time for awhile!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may also help to apologize to him now and then and talk about the fact that you&#39;re learning as you go. You know more about being a mom now than when you started, and you&#39;ve changed your mind about some things. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] My son tries to parent my younger kids","postDate":"1319712493","msgId":63615,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ2RUVDMjcxLUE5RjctNDM4QS1BREFELUY3M0ZEQzc4NEE5NUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBUHpaPVZtY1prNTJORGl5c3ctdGpvdFpSdnRCNS15Vms3RVZLa0sweTI9NFdvTkV2QUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBUHpaPVY9dUdxQXgtdGNUSHBrWjFUcHRDcmRzbW1ERjJ0WXVkd1hCeUw1V2F3bkZjd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDcwMjI2RTBDLTI1NjUtNDM4Ny04Nzk2LTNDRTU4QkFERDcwREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPENBUHpaPVZtY1prNTJORGl5c3ctdGpvdFpSdnRCNS15Vms3RVZLa0sweTI9NFdvTkV2QUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":63609,"nextInTopic":63628,"prevInTime":63614,"nextInTime":63616,"topicId":63605,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
