It was a matter of  etiquette and <br/>\ncourtesy.  In a library, the books don&#39;t belong to the  reader, and I was in <br/>\nschool in the 60&#39;s, when the teachers had grown up with  expensive books, and <br/>\nweren&#39;t fully aware how relatively inexpensive book  production would become.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s not only better for the book, it&#39;s  quieter.  Nobody hit us with a <br/>\nruler, though.  How could THAT be quiet  and good library etiquette!? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I went to the university in the early 70&#39;s, they had just recently  gone <br/>\nfrom a longtime closed-stacks library (patrons brought the call number and  <br/>\nan employee got the book and brought it back to the charge desk) partly because <br/>\n (Keith and I discussed this just Wednesday!) they had a 7 floor book tower <br/>\nwith  a cage elevator.  Dangerous.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut in the early 70&#39;s they opened that up.  There were books from the  19th <br/>\ncentury there.  I had a boyfriend who used to love old stuff too, and  we would <br/>\ngo and just find the oldest books we could and sit and look at the  details <br/>\nof the bindings and illustrations and such.  (Now they&#39;re all in  special <br/>\ncollections rooms, back to the closed stacks plan and you can&#39;t just  cruise for <br/>\nage or binding.)<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I was a kid I gave books to the library whenever I could, thinking it  <br/>\nwas a good idea.  (I wouldn&#39;t do it for anything now, as they often go  <br/>\nstraight to book sales where they&#39;re sold for pennies) but one was a collection  of <br/>\npoetry by Longfellow, and each colored illustration had a piece of (I don&#39;t  <br/>\nknow the term, but fake vellum--partly see-through protective)..paper bound next <br/>\n to it just to protect the illustration.  I was ten or so and someone had  <br/>\ngiven it to me (my grandmother got it at a yard sale or something) and I thought <br/>\n the library could take better care of it than I could.  My mom didn&#39;t care  <br/>\nmuch about books at all, and I was still at the stage of having a REALLY messy <br/>\n room I shared with my cousin.  They did put that one in the library,  <br/>\nthough, and I used to go and look at it sometimes.<br/>\n <br/>\nOne of the first displays I ever remember seeing was on a 1st grade field  <br/>\ntrip to the library in Fort Worth, where they had a display glass case with a  <br/>\nGutenburg Bible and a 19th century Mother Goose book.  Probably other  stuff, <br/>\nbut that&#39;s what I remember.  I also remember the city bus and that  we sat in <br/>\nthe front but there were adults sitting in the back.  They were  all Black.   <br/>\nWe left Texas just a month or two later and I never lived  there again.<br/>\n <br/>\nI like books for the sake of the book-ness (bookitude? bookosity?).   It took <br/>\nme a while to get why my kids don&#39;t care as much about books-as-books as  I <br/>\ndo.
