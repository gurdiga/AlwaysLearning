It shows up when I care too<br/>\nmuch what others think, their opinion, or approval.  If I want my son to<br/>\nstand firm in himself, I must learn to model it.  I&#39;m getting there! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning, over tears and too many signs that we could not ignore, we<br/>\nmade the decision to bring him home full time.  My husband and I feel<br/>\nreally good about it.  See here&#39;s the thing - as I started changing the<br/>\nway I relate to my son, it became apparent that even his little<br/>\npre-school was undermining the freedoms I was giving him.  He was<br/>\ngetting into big trouble for going up a porch sideways instead of using<br/>\nthe stairs - shamed and humiliated in front of me, another parent, and<br/>\nchild.  This among other things sealed the deal.  This is the parent I<br/>\nwant to be.  I stand up for what I know is true about myself and my son.<br/>\nIt is about believing that my love for my son and my care of his<br/>\nemotional health is more important than the latest gadgets a school can<br/>\noffer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie---<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: FINALLY becoming the Parent I am proud to be...","postDate":"1332882063","msgId":66466,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyNkU3OTAxLUQxNEMtNDVBOC1CRDhFLTI5OTc3RTM1RUU5M0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGprdDdjcSs4bjhuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGprdDdjcSs4bjhuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":66465,"nextInTopic":66472,"prevInTime":66465,"nextInTime":66467,"topicId":66412,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Welcome to the gang and let us know how things progress.-=- It s not a gang. :-) It s a discussion of ideas.

I also commend you for not jumping onto and clinging to some diagnosis of your son just because he may learn differently than others at his school. I brought my eight year old son, Nicholas home this year to UNschool after failing last year at doing &quot; homeschool&quot; which basically ended up with him being as miserable as. He was in public school. They also suggested he might have a slight ADD problem and the pediatrician handed me a perscription like it was for bubble gum. We tried it for two days and threw it out. It made him.....um.....just not Nicholas if you get my meaning.<br/>\n    Keep doing what you&#39;re doing and bring him home as much as you can, like you said was your plan. Read a lot of sandradodd.com and check put some good unschooling books on amazo.
