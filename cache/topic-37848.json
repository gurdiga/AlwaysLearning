(Feel free to skip this, anyone  <br/>\nwho&#39;s not interested, but it does add to the discussion of the good  <br/>\nside of what detractors sometimes call &quot;fallacy&quot; on.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://knowledgenews.net/moxie/todaysknowledge/3-ways-to-persuade.shtml\">http://knowledgenews.net/moxie/todaysknowledge/3-ways-to-persuade.shtml</a><br/>\n(I quoted it in case the link is only available to subscribers.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAristotle (right) says, &quot;Calm down, Plato.<br/>\nCampaign rhetoric isn&#39;t that bad.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the Democratic National Convention last week, KnowledgeNews  <br/>\nturned to a political commentator unlike any you&#39;ll find on TV. We  <br/>\nturned to famous Roman orator Cicero (106-43 BC). Yes, Cicero has  <br/>\nbeen dead for 2,000 years, but turns out, he can still give today&#39;s  <br/>\npoliticians advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, during this week&#39;s Republican National Convention, we&#39;re turning  <br/>\nto another political commentator unlike any on TV. We&#39;re turning to  <br/>\nfamous Greek philosopher Aristotle (384-322 BC). He wrote the book on  <br/>\nrhetoric--called The Art of Rhetoric--way back in the 4th century BC.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe asked Aristotle, how should those politicians on the podium try to  <br/>\npersuade? He told us that, aside from &quot;tortures, depositions, and the  <br/>\nlike,&quot; there are only three ways: logos, pathos, and ethos. In  <br/>\nEnglish, you might say logic, emotion, and character. Put it all  <br/>\ntogether, and you get a reasonable argument, passionately made, by a  <br/>\nperson you trust.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n￼1. Logos<br/>\n<br/>\nLogic is an obvious one. After all, who isn&#39;t a sucker for  <br/>\nirrefutable facts, verifiable numbers, and the inexorable march of  <br/>\nreason across the course of a well-constructed speech? In fact, for  <br/>\nmany thinkers, including Aristotle&#39;s mentor, Plato, logos is the only  <br/>\nlegitimate way to win friends and influence people. The rest is  <br/>\nsophistry.<br/>\n<br/>\nLogos was even more persuasive to ancient Greek philosophers, because  <br/>\nthey had a pretty expansive notion of what logos was. It could be the  <br/>\nsimple reason in the words of a speech, or it could mean the supreme  <br/>\nreason of the universe, which all rational appeals naturally plugged  <br/>\ninto.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Pathos<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, unlike old Plato, Aristotle was willing to look beyond  <br/>\nstrictly rational appeals. He recognized that people &quot;do not give  <br/>\njudgment in the same way when aggrieved as when pleased&quot;--especially,  <br/>\nhe snobbily wrote, &quot;audiences of limited intellectual scope and  <br/>\nlimited capacity to follow an extended chain of reasoning.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEnter pathos. Let&#39;s face it, said Aristotle. If you really want to  <br/>\npersuade people, sometimes you have to resort to emotional appeals.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s why campaigns try to wrap themselves in the flag and make you  <br/>\nfear the other guy. It&#39;s why a winning smile and puppy-dog eyes work  <br/>\nmagic in getting your way. It&#39;s why lawyers have the saying &quot;If the  <br/>\nfacts are on your side, pound the facts. If the law is on your side,  <br/>\npound the law. If neither is, pound the table.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, emotional appeals can take more subtle forms, too.  <br/>\nAristotle pointed out that eloquence itself is a kind of emotional  <br/>\npersuasion. &quot;Style makes the matter more persuasive,&quot; he wrote, &quot;for  <br/>\nthe mind is tricked as though the speaker were telling the truth.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Ethos<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a reason-loving philosopher like Aristotle, admitting the power  <br/>\nof pathos had to be hard enough. But he goes even further with ethos.  <br/>\n&quot;Character,&quot; he wrote, &quot;contains almost the strongest proof of all.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nQuite simply, it matters who&#39;s trying to persuade you. If the person  <br/>\ntrying to sway you shows &quot;common sense, virtue, and goodwill&quot; (for  <br/>\nAristotle, an ethical trifecta), then really, aren&#39;t you more likely  <br/>\nto believe what that person says? Aristotle thought so, and so  <br/>\nthought that persuasive attempts must work to &quot;establish the speaker  <br/>\nhimself as being of a certain type&quot;--namely, the type of person  <br/>\nyou&#39;ll believe.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes ethos is the only thing that matters. If, based on arcane  <br/>\nmedical tests, one doctor says you need immediate surgery, and  <br/>\nanother says you don&#39;t, how are you going to decide--except by  <br/>\njudging who seems more credible? Similarly, lawyers put dueling  <br/>\nexperts on the stand, and politicians put dueling wonks on TV. Their  <br/>\nreasons are obscure and technical, and only ethos makes the sale.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s why the old vaudeville philosophers used to say, &quot;If you can  <br/>\nfake sincerity, you&#39;ve got it made.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n--Michael Himick<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n￼<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Logical Fallacy (was: The Scientific Method)","postDate":"1220377730","msgId":37862,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgwOTAyMTA0OG1iZjI1N2YwczgzNTU2ZWNhM2ZkYTllZDhAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDZEMEYxRThFLTQ4NTAtNEM3NS05QTRGLTM5REFFNjg4NERGM0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGc5am8wYytyODhwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgkgPDZEMEYxRThFLTQ4NTAtNEM3NS05QTRGLTM5REFFNjg4NERGM0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":37859,"nextInTopic":37931,"prevInTime":37861,"nextInTime":37863,"topicId":37848,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yes.
