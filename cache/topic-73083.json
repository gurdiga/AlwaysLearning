I rearranged furniture so that when she wanted Dora instead of Moose and Squirrel I could be near her but the tv wasn&#39;t facing me - so the sound wasn&#39;t as intense. I found Dora video games and discovered she doesn&#39;t repeat herself Nearly as much in the game. I expanded our video library with more movies and shows to add variety - not just for me, but because I thought she&#39;d like some other things, too.

You&#39;re thinking if you just keep trying you&#39;ll find a solution she&#39;ll be happy with. But until she&#39;s mature enough to take more than herself into account, she&#39;s going to reject solutions that aren&#39;t perfect for her. What she needs right now isn&#39;t more solutions to reject. She needs a calm, peaceful and centered presence in her life. Certainly give her the opportunity to offer an idea, but don&#39;t draw the process out.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re feeding her frustration with your frustration. She needs someone who is calm. If you can&#39;t be calm, peaceful and centered, how can she be?<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of her frustration in general may be that she recognizes her powerlessness in the world. Find ways she can be powerful in her life that don&#39;t impact others. Stools so she can turn lights on and reach water faucets. Snacks she doesn&#39;t have to ask for help with. Look at how the world is frustrating her and find ways for her not to be frustrated. You *won&#39;t* be able to fix everything. But the fewer things that frustrate her, the more energy she&#39;ll have for the times when the situation can&#39;t be changed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And because she was very shut away from us by the headphones I asked<br/>\n&gt; the group&#39;s opinion if that was a good way to go?

You&#39;re looking for perfection. There is no one right answer for all time for anything in life.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake a more peaceful choice. Be more peaceful. That&#39;s way more doable -- and useful! -- than perfection. <br/>\n<br/>\nHelp her be happy. Help her be happy in ways that don&#39;t bother other people&#39;s peace. Don&#39;t make it more complicated than that.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps part of the problem is you&#39;re seeing all the ideals as equally important. But happy and disconnected is better than connected  and unhappy.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps you&#39;re trying to make people happy rather than creating a more peaceful home.

After thinking them through I think I still have some negative feelings about watching tv/video and although I can appreciate my kids interest in it after a few hours the old feelings creap back in and I blaim it on the noise but probably it is the activity that irritates me. So more reading on the topic is needed and more focusing on my children&#39;s enjoyment then hopefully my irritation will not rise up. And some of you said that I can do other things as long as I&#39;m nearby and available which will help me in this process.<var id=\"ygrps-yiv-1620717290yui-ie-cursor\"></var></p><p>The headphones is something we tried the other day because there were three devices on at once in our livingroom, but it felt like my DD was shut away from us by using headphones. She didn&#39;t share her excitement and tell us about what she was watching and I couldn&#39;t join in watching it with her because she didn&#39;t want to take the headphones off so I could hear her movie. Is that really a good idea?</p><p>I tried opening up a discussion with DD on finding a solution for how we can let everyone watch what they want (maybe taking turns) but she says NO to all options. (she is 4.5 and says NO to most things still). </p><p>So I guess the headphones are the only way.?</p></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":73166,"nextTopicId":73117}}
