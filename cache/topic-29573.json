The other day Mo and I decorated a pan of grits <br/>\n(cooled, like polenta, but white and coarse) with food coloring and <br/>\ncandles. It was a little thing, but it made it more attractive to <br/>\nher, and therefore more desirable. <br/>\n<br/>\nMorgan goes through stretches where she&#39;s so intent on what she&#39;s <br/>\ndoing that she forgets to eat and doesn&#39;t notice food unless its <br/>\nbright and interesting and can be incorporated in her play *and* <br/>\neasy to eat. So from time to time I put foods on tiny little doll <br/>\nplates, or use toys for dishes or cups, or decorate everything with <br/>\nsprinkles, fancy toothpicks and paper drinks-parasols. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps me, when I get frustrated with all these preparations, to <br/>\nthink about what I would do for a fancy dinner party. Good food is <br/>\nmore than simple nourishment, its a multisensory experience. A <br/>\nluxurious meal is expected to be presented beautifully, on gorgeous <br/>\nplates with intricately folded napkins and wonderful music and <br/>\ncarefully considered lighting. People make careers out of food <br/>\npresentation. So putting some energy into making food for my kids <br/>\nappealing makes good sense. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 5.5, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] easy sweets instead of other foods","postDate":"1183224421","msgId":29688,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNBN0IyNEVDLUYxOTAtNDcwNS1CNjc1LTdDMTkxNzQxN0M3QUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEI0MUMyOTgyLTJDQ0ItNDcwOS1CMjdDLTk1MkI0QUYwMjA1MkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEI0MUMyOTgyLTJDQ0ItNDcwOS1CMjdDLTk1MkI0QUYwMjA1MkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":29573,"nextInTopic":29691,"prevInTime":29687,"nextInTime":29689,"topicId":29573,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-=-we (parents ) TRY very hard to refrain from comments about...eating easy sweets instead of other foods.....but we mess up. -=- Other foods can be made","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1885301386\">-=-=-we (parents ) TRY very hard to refrain from comments<br/>\nabout...eating easy sweets instead of other foods.....but we mess up.  <br/>\n-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOther foods can be made easier to access. <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"easy sweets instead of other foods","postDate":"1182871179","msgId":29573,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI0MUMyOTgyLTJDQ0ItNDcwOS1CMjdDLTk1MkI0QUYwMjA1MkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":29688,"prevInTime":29572,"nextInTime":29574,"topicId":29573,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-we (parents ) TRY very hard to refrain from comments about...eating easy sweets instead of other foods.....but we mess up. -=- I can contribute this:","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-942790797\">-=-we (parents ) TRY very hard to refrain from comments<br/>\nabout...eating easy sweets instead of other foods.....but we mess up.  <br/>\n-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI can contribute this:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/food\">http://sandradodd.com/food</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe full original post is here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/</a> <br/>\nAlwaysLearning/message/29565<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m letting the parent be anonymous because I had this by e-mail, and  <br/>\nam taking it down to component topics.
