Because I feel no child should be unschooled <br/>\nagainst his  will.  That would be an oxymoron.  Do some of you disagree <br/>\nwith  that approach?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nNope. But I would also do everything in my power to make home look MUCH  more <br/>\ninteresting (not a difficult proposition! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>\n <br/>\nWe&#39;re in the midst of this discussion at our house right now-----NOT that  <br/>\neither of my boys are interested in school. It&#39;s the girlfriend.<br/>\n <br/>\nCarly (Cameron&#39;s girlfriend) believes that I&#39;m brainwashing Duncan, 8.  (I <br/>\njoke about that all the time. But at the same time, I would allow him to go  to <br/>\nschool if that&#39;s what he really wanted.) <br/>\n <br/>\nCarly and Cameron have these long discussions about children and  <br/>\nchild-rearing (NOT that anything&#39;s in the oven! &lt;g&gt;), not mention  unschooling vs <br/>\nschool.She thinks that Cameron, having had eight years of  schooling, can make an <br/>\ninformed decision about school---*even though* he hasn&#39;t  been in high school. <br/>\n(He HAS sat in on a college class, though.) But  that Duncan, always unschooled, <br/>\ncannot.<br/>\n <br/>\nI contend that *I* have been on both sides of the fence and have chosen  <br/>\nwisely. *She* has only seen the schooled side---*she* has not been exposed  enough <br/>\nto unschooling to make an informed decision. Cameron&#39;s seen both and  chooses <br/>\nto remain at home. Duncan is only eight---he has plenty of time to form  <br/>\nopinions---while watching the tv shows that encourage schools! How lame! He also  <br/>\nhas a schooled friend who comes over with all the school baggage---and I&#39;m NOT <br/>\n talking homework! &lt;g&gt; Duncan sees that already---comparing CJ to his  <br/>\nunschooled buds.<br/>\n <br/>\nI joke with the boys that I&#39;m brainwashing them. But I&#39;ve told stories  about <br/>\nschool. Good stories. I had exceptional teachers. Lots of them! Of course,  <br/>\nthere was no option back then. It was school for me or jail-time for my <br/>\nparents.  I chose school! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI think the big difference here is that the schooled kids are being  <br/>\nbrainwashed by school, their parents, AND society----but no one thinks of THAT  as <br/>\nbrainwashing! That&#39;s just the way it is. But whatever you do----watch out for  <br/>\nthose Holties! That brainwashing cult!<br/>\n <br/>\nPuleeze!<br/>\n <br/>\nShe&#39;s planning on college.
