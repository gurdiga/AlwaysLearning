It made me feel really good <br/>\nyesterday---and it&#39;s not so often that &quot;our&quot; parenting choices impress <br/>\nothers. Usually we&#39;re criticized for being &quot;indulgent&quot; or &quot;permissive&quot; <br/>\nor something equally negative.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuncan and I (and the guide dog, Rotey) were eating lunch at a deli. A <br/>\nman---he was young-ish---early-mid thirties?---sat down behind Duncan. <br/>\nI noticed he was listening in on our conversation and looking over <br/>\nevery now and then.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe ate, read Yu-Gi-Oh! cards, talked about the beach & the guide dogs, <br/>\nshared pickles, wrapped a present for a friend&#39;s birthday party. I told <br/>\nhim how to spell &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; on the card.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fellow got up to leave but stopped by our table and said, &quot;I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t help but notice....&quot;  Now---usually that means something about <br/>\nthe guide dog, so I was ready with guide dog talk.&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut he said, &quot;You are really good with him.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI thanked him.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said, &quot;You don&#39;t see that very often.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI said, &quot;No, you don&#39;t.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I just wanted to say something. Most parents don&#39;t treat their kids <br/>\nlike that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI said, &quot;Thank you for noticing and for commenting. It&#39;s always nice to <br/>\nhear.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDuncan got a HUGE grin and kept that smile all afternoon! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI make a point of complimenting  moms who are sweet with their kids <br/>\nwhen I see it too---it&#39;s just so rare. It&#39;s nice to be on the receiving <br/>\nend of the compliment! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\nOctober 6-9, 2005<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22182,"nextTopicId":22188}}
