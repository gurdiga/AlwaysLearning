What I didn&#39;t tell others on this list was<br/>\nthe conversation that took place over the past 4 months with my mother<br/>\nsince I was off the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother is an absolute control freak who has to be right about<br/>\neverything.... She told me that not only does she not believe in home<br/>\nschooling but that she has no intention of learning anything about it,<br/>\neither my reading, talking or viewing anything on the topic.  She knows<br/>\nshe&#39;s right and that Zak (now 7) is going to be bored at home and needs<br/>\nmore discipline.  This from a mother that allowed me at 15 to start<br/>\ntraipsing around the world in a band and then work on a cruise ship all<br/>\nover the Mediterranean!!!!!  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe even told me a couple of weeks ago that the law states in Arizona<br/>\n(where we live) that kids have to be tested at age 8.  When I probed her<br/>\nfor where she saw that info she fluffed it off with &quot;on some web<br/>\nsite&quot;... When I pushed the issue and said &quot;where so that I can write to<br/>\nthem and let them have the correct information&quot; she got pissed at me and<br/>\ntold me she didn&#39;t want to argue with me and hung up the phone on me.<br/>\nTypical my mother behavior.  I contacted someone from our local home<br/>\nschooling group to triple check on the law in AZ and she sent me the AZ<br/>\nweb site that says nothing about testing (which I already knew)...  I<br/>\nthen forwarded it to my mother but didn&#39;t tell her I was sending it.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know if she ever read it because she never said anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI try not to give her the opportunity to say anything about what we are<br/>\ndoing because it&#39;s always her opinion that&#39;s the correct one and we are<br/>\nsomehow harming our children.  Sometimes it does feel like an uphill<br/>\nbattle.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was reading what everyone posted about this and (sorry don&#39;t remember<br/>\nwho it was) has the opposite problem where their mother talks to the<br/>\nrelatives and never says anything to the mother.  Sometimes I wish that<br/>\nwas my mother and she&#39;d just shut her mouth, mind her own business and<br/>\nkeep her opinions to herself......<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really important for me to talk about this stuff (I know you know<br/>\nthat Heather) because otherwise I start to doubt myself and what I&#39;m<br/>\ndoing.  I even looked into a school for Zak when this was all happening.<br/>\nIt&#39;s an unschooling school like Sudbury but as a friend of mine pointed<br/>\nout &quot;So you are going to pay $640 per month for Zak to do what he&#39;s<br/>\ndoing at home?&quot;  HMMMMMMMM....<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\nTucson, AZ</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9465,"nextTopicId":9286}}
