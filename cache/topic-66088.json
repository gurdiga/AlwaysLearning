Potato Guy has backgrounds and things you can<br/>\n&gt; arrange on the backgrounds. One is a castle with sort of Robin Hood-ish<br/>\n&gt; penguins. Another is a countryside background with a train track, road,<br/>\n&gt; stream, and hills which can be decorated with buildings, people, and<br/>\n&gt; vehicles. And, of course, there are a couple of Mister Potatohead type<br/>\n&gt; backgrounds. Can anyone recommend anything in that general vein that<br/>\n&gt; available either online or for Windows 2000/XP?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sue<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":504581862,"authorName":"Sue Solberg","from":"Sue Solberg &lt;italapas@...&gt;","profile":"ipsscm","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"looking for computer games","postDate":"1331744775","msgId":66088,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBQkdBM1dxakdyWjRyK1B0ZGVFQ2NoMjUtPStSUEc3UGRLT1R1NllKZDl3QzAxY29HZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":66097,"prevInTime":66087,"nextInTime":66089,"topicId":66088,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello, My daughter is just turned five and I m trying to find more computer games to play with her.

She loves them, but unfortunately we can only be on that<br/>\ncomputer in the evenings.  During the day we use my laptop, which has an<br/>\nolder version of Windows.
