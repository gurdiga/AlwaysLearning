After talking, we discovered they all shared a fear <br/>\nof a power outage.  That was easily solved.  We took a trip to <br/>\nWalMart and they all chose their very own flashlights and lanterns <br/>\nwhich they keep in their rooms.  During storms, they used to come <br/>\nrunning into my room to pile into my bed.  Now they just all sleep <br/>\ntogether in my son&#39;s room.  The girls fix a blanket pallet on the <br/>\nfloor and they have their flashlights ready.  Most of the time, I go <br/>\nin and lay with them during the worst of the storm but they seem to <br/>\nneed me less and less each time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how I would handle a fear of tornados.  We live in GA <br/>\nand while there have been a few tornados and even one extremely mild <br/>\nearthquake, we just don&#39;t experience enough for it to be a real fear <br/>\nI guess.  Do you know if there are tornado sirens nearby so that if <br/>\na tornado was ever spotted, you&#39;d hear the warning?  Or what about <br/>\nan all news/weather channel on the radio or television?  Perhaps <br/>\nhearing a weather report will empower your son to feel he&#39;s somewhat <br/>\nin control if he can be forewarned of any real danger?  What&#39;s your <br/>\nbasement like?  Maybe you can fix up a fun sleeping place so that <br/>\nwhen he does feel the need to be safe, he can also be comfortable <br/>\ntoo, sort of like camping out.

Sam (8) is really really afraid of storms. He is afraid that a tornado will happen. He is hiding out in the basement when it gets just alittle bit windy. I feel so badly for him. I sit with him and we talk, but nothing really helps him feel better until the storm ends. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe saw the movie Twister (at his request) about 6 months ago. Then, one of his friends asked him if he heard about the real tornado that had happened nearby. Then, this friend told him that a tornado can happen even if there is just 10 mile an hour wind. Well, his friend is terrified of storms, so I think a bit of that fear got projected onto Sam. We have read books, looked up information, and talked and talked about movies vs. real life. Nothing is helping him at this point. I have tried positive imagery, and making sure that he is talking about his fear, and what it is he is afraid of. Sometimes he says he doesn&#39;t know what he is afraid of, just that something bad will happen. Also, he says that when he hears the loud thunder he thinks of big trees. <br/>\n<br/>\nI just thought I would post here to see if anyone has some ideas or suggestions that I can try, to help him feel less scared.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nAmie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25330,"nextTopicId":25314}}
