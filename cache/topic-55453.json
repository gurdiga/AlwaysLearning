Doing one load of laundry and putting it away as soon as there are enough dirty clothes for a load.<br/>\n<br/>\nIdentifying the things that make me feel most uncomfortable in my house and targeting those. For instance, if the kitchen counters are clear, I could walk on a filthy kitchen floor for months and feel no discomfort at all; likewise, if we can keep the big table cleared off so we have space to do things there, that&#39;s huge.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoing quick-and-dirty pickups--like tossing everything on the floor into one big laundry basket for sorting out later at my leisure.<br/>\n<br/>\nAsking other people in the house to do really targeted tasks. My partner David is good for helping the kids pick up the living room floor, and sorting out the big baskets of random stuff from time to time, but usually only if I ask him. Likewise, the boys (who are 6 and 9) usually respond very cheerfully to a specific thing like, &quot;It would be a big help if you&#39;d pick up all the Playmobil off the floor and put it in the bin,&quot; or, &quot;If you&#39;re done with your cups and plates, please put them in the kitchen.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShifts of perspective. Just this morning, I saw my therapist (I&#39;ve recently gone back to therapy after not needing it for a long time, because of some big life stuff that left me not coping as well as usual). I told her that this past week I hadn&#39;t spent any time going through these bins in the living room that have been piling up full of random toys and junk for months, as I had planned to and have been planning to for weeks but having trouble tackling, and she said, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s OK. Your family&#39;s values are really more about family connections and supporting people&#39;s development than about your physical space, and it sounds like you did a good job connecting with your kids this week. That&#39;s more important.&quot; She&#39;s right, and it&#39;s something I&#39;ve lost sight of when I get caught up in thinking I have to do it all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mentioned to someone recently that I&#39;ve figured out I can do 2 of the following 3 things on any given day: keep up with the house; be present for my kids the way I want to; other things that matter to me for me, like reading and writing. Some days I can do all 3 more or less, but I can only do 2 of them really well, right now.

We have cleaning up the dishes as part of the meal -- preparation of the meal, eating the meal, cleaning up after the meal -- and we work together, so it&#39;s short and fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe always bought little tools we ours were wee ones.  (I bought two swiffers and made one shorter than normal and one longer, too).  You can get brooms and mops and dust pans and all sorts of tools for smaller hands -- they&#39;re really cute and it can be a fun game to do housework together.  (And the nice thing about starting from a place of not being a TypeA, neatnik mother is that your wee one won&#39;t run afoul an impossibly high standard -- her efforts will be great).<br/>\n<br/>\nI found that keeping cleaning supplies handy (toilet brush immediately beside the toilet) helped -- I&#39;m not off looking for something to give the toilet a quick scrub -- I can simply do it, and it&#39;s done.  A squeegie in the bath (I squeegie before I towel off) keeps the grime and water/soap build up down in the shower.   I do a deep clean on immediately before my shower when I do the big scrub -- I&#39;m already there, and, when I&#39;m done and feeling grubby, I&#39;m ready to shower).  <br/>\n<br/>\nDecluttering our lives (toys we weren&#39;t using, clothes we don&#39;t wear, things we don&#39;t use) helped us immensely.

You don&#39;t even have to &quot;get rid&quot; of the stuff, you could just box up stuff you&#39;re not using and either rotate it in and out, or see if you have any want of it in the next year, and decide then if it&#39;s something that is enhancing your life.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d start with just one thing -- probably the kitchen/meals (because dirty laundry piles don&#39;t generally attract pestilence), and tackle one thing at a time, establishing new habits and routines that fit your family.<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrea<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; As it is, I often feel very overwhelmed (and it was that way before unschooling as well, and before children, I guess I never knew how to keep house and now its so much harder) by how quickly it all devolves into what looks like chaos.

I&#39;m not the best housekeeper and have a tendency to do all of the things you&#39;ve mentioned. First of all, don&#39;t be too hard on yourself. You do clean, even if it&#39;s not at the times you think you should (i.e. - after dinner instead of before dinner). Also remember that most people clean more when people are watching them... so just because they are cleaning while you are there, doesn&#39;t mean they keep their house that way when you&#39;re not!<br/>\n<br/>\nThankfully, I&#39;m married to a guy who&#39;s really good at knowing how to keep a house clean and he&#39;s helped me a lot over the past 15 years showing me how to make my life easier. Here are some of the things I&#39;ve learned from him...<br/>\n<br/>\nLaundry: If you have more than 3 loads of dirty laundry, bag it all up in trashbags and take them to a laundromat. Start all of the loads at once, then go to the park or lunch or something else fun. Come back in about half an hour and transfer everything to dryers. Leave and go do something else fun. When everything is dry, don&#39;t even bother folding anything. Bring the clothes home in the trashbags, put on a movie (or two) and fold clothes while watching movies. Have snacks available for helpers that want to fold and watch the movie(s) with you :) Don&#39;t put the laundry away! Put it in boxes and put the boxes next to where you usually store clothes. Anything that is not worn over the next couple of weeks... get rid of it. Put unworn items in your car with the intention of giving it away. If you don&#39;t give them away within a couple of days, throw them away. <br/>\n<br/>\nDishes: Only keep two of everything (glasses, spoons, bowls, etc.) for each family member in your kitchen cabinets. Store the rest, for when you have guests, in a box in a closet or garage. Also, store anything that is not used frequently somewhere other than your kitchen.<br/>\n<br/>\nPapers: This has been a major problem for me. I don&#39;t know why, but I have a really hard time filing things. What I&#39;ve found that works for me is &quot;piling&quot;. I pile papers on my desk and put them away about twice a week. I &quot;file&quot; my papers in a box like this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.officemax.com/office-furniture/literature-holders-sorters/literature-sorters/product-ARS22110?cm_mmc=GBase-_-Office%20Furniture-_-Literature%20Holders%20and%20Sorters-_-Literature%20Sorters&ci_src=14110944&ci_sku=03100067\">http://www.officemax.com/office-furniture/literature-holders-sorters/literature-sorters/product-ARS22110?cm_mmc=GBase-_-Office%20Furniture-_-Literature%20Holders%20and%20Sorters-_-Literature%20Sorters&ci_src=14110944&ci_sku=03100067</a> ... for some reason, I hate putting things away in folders in a drawer, but have no problem sliding them on a shelf. Once a year, I take all papers out of their slots, put them in folders and put them in a box. When I&#39;m &quot;filing&quot; twice a week, I drag the kitchen trashcan next to my paper box so it&#39;s really easy to throw things away. Otherwise, I would just leave the &quot;trash&quot; papers on my desk and they would get mixed up with the &quot;keep&quot; papers.<br/>\n<br/>\nToys: Get all of the toys both lying around and in toyboxes and bag or box them up. Don&#39;t try to sort the toys into categories or think about it too much. Just run around your house and bag or box everything up. Don&#39;t think about what might be used. Store these boxes/bags either in the corner of the room where they were laying, a closet or garage. After you&#39;ve done this, allow the kids to pull whatever they want out of the bags/boxes. Each night run around the house with a laundry basket and take all of the toys that are lying around and put them in your empty toyboxes. After a couple of weeks, you can donate anything that&#39;s not been played with or store them and rotate toys (trade them when they&#39;re bored of what they&#39;ve been playing with). <br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps! <br/>\n~ Amanda (a true hoarder by nature)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;shirarocklin&quot; &lt;shirarocklin@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would really appreciate some ideas about how to keep house while unschooling.

Today I&#39;m ignoring the mess, but feel immobilized to do anything else because there isn&#39;t any space to do it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIs there any way at all, with this age children, to keep some semblance of order, while unschooling, so that we can just even function day to day? <br/>\n<br/>\nI could write tons more, but Temima needs me.  <br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nShira</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55649,"nextTopicId":55697}}
