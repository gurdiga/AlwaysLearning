And I think it&#39;s naturally<br/>\ncommon in a culture that discourages emotion closeness and doesn&#39;t nurture<br/>\nkids. I see it a lot online and somewhat in real life, and I stay away from<br/>\nit as much as possible. While it concerns me for the people in the lives of<br/>\nnegative folks who must be dodging it or agreeing with it too, all *I* can<br/>\ndo (sometimes ... maybe) is plant of little seed of positivity or happy<br/>\nthought that might grow (or not). Mostly I tend my own garden, watering and<br/>\nenriching the happiness planted there by me and others.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of those perspectives can come on their own, one can be infected with<br/>\nit from someone else, or it can even be called into existence and fed, made<br/>\nto grow bigger and bigger. It&#39;s good to know that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s amazing the effect of either perspective in a life; positive and<br/>\nnegative. Not that everything is positive but one&#39;s perspective can be<br/>\ngenerally positive even about negative things. Or it can be negative about<br/>\npositive things. Life being what it is, things are what they are but that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean my outlook need be grim. And for the people around me,<br/>\nespecially for Karl, I remind myself often to stay away from stewing and<br/>\nmuttering over things that aren&#39;t always as we might like them to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes the little little box that negativity is can stupify a person into<br/>\nall sorts of regressions and inwardnesses, navel gazing in the worst ways.<br/>\nBy contrast, the big wide openness that emotional positivity is can stupify<br/>\nin a good way in the other direction, toward life rather than away from it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo toward the light.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, Feb 12, 2010 at 11:33 AM, Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; -=-Are we sure that this person really is a 36 year old adult, or a very<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; unhappy teen representing themself as an adult for the sake of<br/>\n&gt; having an<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; unfettered online account?
