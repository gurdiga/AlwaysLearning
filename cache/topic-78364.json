It’s OK, it can’t really be rushed but it can be addressed and analysed and taken seriously as an undertaking. You are looking to be a careful observer of yourself, but in a spirit of curiosity and fun, not judgment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes a long time, and usually longer for the parent than the kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYour wish for a gathering sounds a little (actually, very!) schoolish to me, and I wonder what it is you think it will bring to each of your individual children.  Take some time to really ask what it’s purpose is other than to make you feel purposeful?   I know I used to think I’d really achieved something if both my kids were sitting at a table doing something with pen and paper together at the same time.  Then I realised what an agenda I had. And what if they simply said ‘no thanks mum not today’ and simply carried on playing in the mud. Would that be ok for you? would you feel someone was missing?  Families ebb and flow.  They rarely formally ‘gather’ with ‘activites’. That sounds like a class. Many willingly gather at mealtimes though, or to watch movies.  But not always.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the idea of strewing, in my understanding strewing is something completely different. It is a seemingly  casual, often unmentioned, enriching of your environment with cool and interesting stuff.  Yes, books, games etc maybe, but also things you find in a junkshop, a wierd sweet from japan you found in the supermarket, an obscure musical instrument given to you by a neighbour… It might generate interest, it might not. It might be for anyone in the family, including your husband.  Something to discover, trip over, trigger conversation.  No agenda.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBelinda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":582038319,"authorName":"Randi Timmons","from":"Randi Timmons &lt;withgreatexpectations7@...&gt;","profile":"withgreatexpectations7","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Gathering","postDate":"1524431617","msgId":78364,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDcwQzYxRDAxLUNBMTUtNDlGMC1CRkUxLTI1NDNDNzlGNUI0RkB5YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":78365,"prevInTime":78363,"nextInTime":78365,"topicId":78364,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello, We have been deschooling for 2 months.
