It happened with my daughter.  She didn&#39;t start feeling less fearful until she was 11 - 12 years old. I think that her maturing development along with her growing trust in her father and me were important factors in her improvements.  As she grew older, she was better able to see how she could reason herself past her fears.  This didn&#39;t start happening until she wanted it though.  She told me that she didn&#39;t want to be so worried anymore and that she wanted to be able to do things that her fears were preventing her from doing -- mostly social things. That is when we read that book.  I never pushed her to use the techniques in that book. I didn&#39;t even buy it until she asked me to please help her with her debilitating fears.  Several times after we read it I reminded her about the techniques she&#39;d learned and I sometimes talked her through them when she wanted me to.  We also reread the book together several times.  I think the key was SHE wanted to change herself. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen your son wants it for himself, he will be more receptive to the suggestions in the book.  As he gets older, if he gets very unhappy about his fears and feels they are interfering with what he wants to do, he may ask you for more help.  If you feel like you need more help, it&#39;s okay to see a professional.  I told Zoe that I would do whatever I could to help her as much as she wanted.  I told her that a therapist might be able to give us some useful ideas and she asked me to arrange for us to see one together.  We saw a woman (MSW, LISW) who practiced Play Therapy with children.  She allowed me to stay in the room with them, and Zoe played some, but mostly she preferred to talk with the therapist about what was going on in her life and how she was coping with her fears and frustrations.  The therapist never applied any labels to Zoe as far as I know -- she may have made a diagnosis for insurance purposes but she never told us.  She mostly encouraged Zoe to keep doing the things that worked well for her, she made some suggestions to Zoe about ways to cope and she listened and reflected back to both of us what we told her.  My confidence was buoyed because the therapist told me that she thought that everything I was doing was right on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have two specific questions<br/>\n&gt; 1)\tIs it helpful to him to refuse to accommodate him, or will it damage his trust/security?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>A lot of the books I read about Obsessive Compulsive Disorder suggested parents and teachers refuse to accommodate or reassure the child. On a couple of occassions I tried not accomodating her requests but then saw  Zoe&#39;s anxiety increase and she would become frantic and desperate.  A desperate, frantic child who doesn&#39;t trust their parent to keep them safe -- can be very dangerous.  There were two occasions when my refusal to accommodate her requests resulted in her attempting to flee the scene (near public roads far from home) without me.  I regret those incidences.  When Zoe&#39;s anxiety levels were so high, there was no reasoning with her, whatsoever.  When she did not trust me she would not tell me what she was afraid of and she would not follow my directions even if it was a serious safety issue.  I had a hard time understanding what triggered her sudden fears for awhile.  However, once I was able to gain her trust again, through consistently accommodating her requests, no questions asked, for a period of weeks at least, she began to relax, trust that I would help her feel safe no matter the situation, and she started to open up to me. The more I thought about it, the more I came to the conclusion that her ability to deal with her fears and eventually decide to take control of them, would be greatly inhibited if she were in a frequent state of high anxiety.  My goal then, was to allow her to feel as little stress as possible for as long a time as she needed.  I wanted to stop the flow of whatever chemicals were flooding her brain all the times she was so anxious.  I suspected that allowing her to return to a near constant state of calm and relaxation, would result in her being better able to do the work she would need to do to conquer her fears. I couldn&#39;t see how it would hurt.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2)\tHow can we balance his need to feel safe with his brothers need to live without catering to his brothers irrationality?

Her brother is six years older, so it was easier for him to understand and be patient during the times when we were focused on her, than it would be for a younger sibling. When she used to insist that he wash his hands or she tried to dictate to him what he could or could not eat based on her own fears, I would say to her that it was okay for her to make those decisions for herself but that she couldn&#39;t make them for other people.  Then if she couldn&#39;t calm down about it I would usually remove her from her brother&#39;s presence and stay with her until she was calmed down.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Helping DS with intense anxiety","postDate":"1318633354","msgId":63410,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGo3YWYyYSsxZWo1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhBRUFGMEJGLTREQjUtNDZCRC1BQ0Y5LTU2RkIyMEVBMUU4MUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":63409,"nextInTopic":63411,"prevInTime":63409,"nextInTime":63411,"topicId":63360,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ******************* And there are things adults are terrified of that they do anyway.

Maybe, as Sandra suggested, a wig or some other partial head covering - cover the back maybe for comfort?

Consider his rituals and needs as facts, real life limits to brainstorm around. It could help to imagine that he has an obvious Physical disability and think about how you&#39;d help him.

He might stay with his parents.  He might end up helping them out, and inheriting the house (I have no idea about laws or house prices in the UK, I&#39;m just talking about f&#39;rinstances).  He might end up logicking himself out of all this, or maturing in his nervous system in some way that will make him more comfortable with his own sensations and fears.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are things kids are full-on terrified of that they work out, in their own ways, as they get older or puberty comes along.  Fear of the dark, fear of the closets, of the space beneath the bed, or of dogs or strangers or loud noises.   Some kids might not get over those until they&#39;re 18, some when they&#39;re 8.  I think that&#39;s a normal range for  physical (biochemical or whatever) maturity and for cognitive practice and maturity.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMarty (22) is in the room and says he&#39;s always been afraid of mystery (of spooky darkness, and that someone might jump out of the dark).  When he was 18, he and Holly went to Florida and there was an offer to take them to the beach.  Marty didn&#39;t want to.  He said the ocean scared him.  He was fine to swim in Elephant Butte Lake (out in the middle, in and out of a houseboat), and in the Blue Hole in Santa Rosa (over 300 feet deep, he thinks).   <br/>\n<br/>\nNow that he&#39;s older, he says, he&#39;s not afraid of being in at the edge of the ocean (he did a surfing lesson in San Diego two years ago), but the idea of being in the middle of the ocean where he doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s below him and it&#39;s big enough to sink a ship scares him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Marty&#39;s case, he needs to not join the navy.  And I&#39;m not sure how he would feel about intercontinental travel.  He had talked about going to India with me last year.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Marty figures 18 is arbitrary. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still a little afraid of public transportation, and I&#39;m 58. :-)<br/>\nI grew up in a town without a taxi, bus, nothing.  Moved to a small city (Albuquerque) with city buses and nothing more.  <br/>\nI&#39;m not afraid in a fear-of-0thers or fear-of-equipment way. I&#39;m just afraid of the awkwardness of not knowing what I&#39;m doing.  It&#39;s part of perfectionism, maybe.  I avoid activities in which I&#39;m incompetent.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m afraid of Japanese soup, but not afraid it will get me in the dark.  I just don&#39;t order it in restaurants. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m making light of this only to put it in context.  Fears, whether rational or not, are personal and people will get over their fears the same personal and individual ways they learn about history, geography, math, music, art, cooking, butt-wiping, shoe-tying, games-playing.

But he hasn&#39;t grown out of it, it hasn&#39;t got easier and shows no signs of shifting.<br/>\nWe have believed that accommodating and therefore his trusting us was appropriate. In the early years we found that if we dealt with one issue others popped up in their place, so after a while decided to stick with the ones we know. Unfortunately they have become very fixed for DS. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt may sound like he&#39;s a controlling tyrant in the family, but it certainly isn&#39;t about any desire/need to control on his part. He is all too aware of the negative effects on the family and often expresses his gratitude that we understand what it&#39;s like for him. He does feel as strongly when he has to get up and do it himself, but I then worry that I am not being kind and loving towards him. He will rush around with wet cloths and/or wear disposable gloves. It is definitely not about laziness or bossiness for him. It is about fear (which he actually knows is irrational), and it is about needing to avoid things or develop rituals to make him safe. He wishes it were different.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is quite certain that he will never travel abroad once his passport runs out next year (most of our family is abroad) since he will never take his hat off in public (you are not allowed to wear hats in passport photos). He has worn the same hat for several years and says that he feels as if he were naked without it. In desperation I even tried to bribe him by saying I would buy him any lego set he wanted if he would walk into the toyshop without his hat.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe certainly expects to live alone when he is older (this has come up from time to time) and cheerfully tells us that having a wife and children will be his brother&#39;s job! Any suggestion that his dreams or ideas about the future might involve him having to tackle his fears sends him away from those dreams/ideas rather than towards tackling the fears.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes his reactions are more severe than others, and I will definitely look for any hunger/sleep connections. I have also ordered the worry book that&#39;s been suggested.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have two specific questions<br/>\n1)\tIs it helpful to him to refuse to accommodate him, or will it damage his trust/security?<br/>\n2)\tHow can we balance his need to feel safe with his brothers need to live without catering to his brothers irrationality?

She told me that when she touched something that her brain told her it would contaminate her hands and that her hands had the physical sensation of being cold, until she washed them.

Also, don&#39;t go see the new movie - Contagion - lol!<br/>\n<br/>\nShe used to avoid watching any new TV shows or movies for fear there would be throwing up in them.  She likes me to pre-screen movies as much as possible and I use the website kidsinmind.com for that.  It has very detailed factual information about scenes that may be considered violent and/or gory in addition to profanity and sexual content without revealing the plot.  For TV shows, she prefers to watch new-to-her shows by herself so that if there is a gross scene, she can react (or not react) in private.  She often will share TV episodes with us that she&#39;s already seen and knows are not disturbing.  She mostly uses Netflix for TV show watching.  One exception is the TV show Glee.  She asks us to preview it for her each week and then she watches it online when it becomes available on their website the next week.  We enjoy the show too, so we&#39;re happy to watch it when it comes on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that these accommodations may seem extreme to some but they&#39;re very much improved from where we were just a couple of years ago and she is so much more relaxed and happy with her life, getting more confident and willing to try new things more and more all the time!<br/>\n<br/>\nChris<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Helping DS with intense anxiety","postDate":"1318515928","msgId":63383,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMTg1MTU5MjguODYwNTkuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTA1Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDkwM0JEQzFBLUYwOUQtNDBEOC04OTNDLUI5Qjc3OUJCRjU5MEBnbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGo3NW9yaSt0M3QxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8OTAzQkRDMUEtRjA5RC00MEQ4LTg5M0MtQjlCNzc5QkJGNTkwQGdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":63382,"nextInTopic":63384,"prevInTime":63382,"nextInTime":63384,"topicId":63360,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Those were great ideas for hand chapping Chris.

When we honored and respected his wishes that he wanted and needed things to be done differently from others, I think he truly felt understood.  Feeling understood and respected might have been a stepping stone in becoming more comfortable with some things that most others felt at ease with. <br/>\n<br/>\nie. I recall explaining aloud to his sisters(one older and one younger) that we needed to be quiet so Li could use the bathroom - he had a few things he always had to do before using the bathroom and needing absolute silence was one of them.  It was tricky though as his younger sister was only about one year old at the time and very young children can&#39;t always be quiet for periods of time.  Plus, he wanted me to be nearby.  But...I tried.  I tried to stay close and quiet.  I explained to his sisters within earshot of him how important is was to be as quiet and respectful as we could.  We did this every day.  Sometimes more than once.  I noticed a change in him after he heard me explaining this to his sisters - maybe because he realized we were making an effort and we did care and he and his needs were important.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThings didn&#39;t change in a short period of time.  It took years.  We gave him the space and time he needed to deal with whatever it was and I think because we took him seriously, he didn&#39;t feel like he was being judged or that he should be doing or not doing something else.  We didn&#39;t handle this perfectly all the time.

I was getting a tour of the garden, from the boys, and I touched something to ask what it was, and he said I had to wash my hands now.  I thought it was advice for my own future health, which was fine, and I figured I would wash my hands when I got back in the house, before I ate, but it was more than that.  He wanted me to wash them (I think) before I touched anything else in his house.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause I was company and a foreigner, he cut me some slack. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think maybe, Alison, you could talk to him about how he might take care of things when he&#39;s grown and has his own place.  When he has his own kitchen, how will he keep track of which glasses are cleanest?   In a curious way, I mean, to get him to analyze what he&#39;s thinking and why.  If his own thoughts are spinning, he might not be analyzing which parts of them are the most important, and which parts of them are unreasonable in light of the realities of living with other people.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest, Kirby, had the habit lots of oldest kids do of making the rules, calling the shots, and telling other kids how to play.  When one of the other kids had a birthday, I would coach him to remember not to take over.  When he went to someone else&#39;s house and he wasn&#39;t the one, single guest but there would be a group, I advised him to only manage a little bit of the activities, or to make suggestions he was willing to have ignored, so other kids could get a chance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe phrase I used a couple of times (on the side, not in front of other kids) when he seemed particularly hyper and overly controlling was &quot;Don&#39;t breathe more than your share of the air.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could tell him he&#39;s been controlling his brother for six years, and how would he feel if his brother got to make all the decisions for the next six years?    Maybe a long discussion, maybe just that one question.  It might help him to think about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s getting old enough to get his own food and to wash his own glasses.  Maybe, at least sometimes, saying &quot;I don&#39;t know how clean it is.  Do you want to wash it to make sure?&quot; would help.  Maybe he&#39;s controlled you long enough, too.  I don&#39;t suggest to stop immediately, but to gradually move toward making his preferences his own problem and not so much the whole family&#39;s.  He might not feel so strongly about it if he has to get up and do the work himself.  Or maybe he&#39;s not really thinking about how much others have done to accommodate him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he were balking, maybe you could say that you really don&#39;t mind giving him the safe haven of home, and the privacy and special environment that can be (reminding him school wouldn&#39;t allow for him making so many rules, and really wouldn&#39;t make a move to try to get the other kids or even the teacher to follow them), but that you&#39;re not willing to sacrifice giving his brother a home environment in which he, too, can make choices and live in the ways he would like to.   <br/>\n<br/>\nYour oldest boy doesn&#39;t get to tell everyone else in the family how to be, act, eat, wash, etc.  You did him a favor while he was too young to do those things, but he&#39;s older now, and the situation could potentially start to be amended.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe &#39;the scientific method&#39; would help too.  He could experiment with something and see how he handles bending one of his own rules. Or maybe ask him to explain the why of one thing or another, and in his analysis of why he wants this or that, he might start to find ways to untangle what he&#39;s created.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy cousin (who lived with us) used to &quot;have to&quot; walk back home the say way she went, or she said she would &quot;tangle her string.&quot;  I wanted to walk to town one way, and home another, or at least on another side of the street, but she had to go on the same side of each tree or bush, cross the street in the same place we had before, etc., for a couple of years.  It wasn&#39;t fun for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":291337950,"authorName":"alma","from":"&quot;alma&quot; &lt;almadoing@...&gt;","profile":"almadoing","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Helping DS with intense anxiety","postDate":"1318409376","msgId":63360,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGo3M2tiMCsxdDlnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":63362,"prevInTime":63359,"nextInTime":63361,"topicId":63360,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We have two sons aged 9 and 6 who ve never been to school.

We parented conventionally til DS1 was about 4 when we were looking for alternatives to school, discovered unschooling, then radical unschooling and have never looked back.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason we were looking for alternatives at that time was that DS1 was clearly not ready to leave home. On the odd occasion we had tried a crèche (eg an hour at the gym) it had become clear he was desperately unhappy. He has a number of difficulties, and, by age 4, had acquired a few labels/dx.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have tried to make home as safe a place as possible for him to be, as we believe his intense anxiety and stress is a barrier to learning and he has, in many ways, flourished. Part of helping him feel safe has been to do as he asks wrt his, to us, irrational fears. Let me give a couple of typical scenarios 1) I prepare one of the few foods he will eat. He will then wash his hands up to the elbows, sit down, and begin to eat (with his hands, not cutlery). Inadvertently, DH might pass by &quot;too close&quot;, and DS will scream that he cannot now eat his food.  Or 2) DS will ask for a drink and I will bring it to him. As he takes it he&#39;ll ask &quot;Where did you get this glass?&quot; (the cupboard) &quot;Is it clean?&quot; (yes, it&#39;s straight from the cupboard) &quot;I want a glass from the back of the cupboard&quot;. These two examples are to do with food, but there are other issues to do with clothing, going to the toilet and more.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of years ago we saw a family psychologist for while, but he didn&#39;t really feel he could help.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently DS2 has started to resist accommodating some of DS1&#39;s irrational (though rational to DS1) requests, and this has led to some intense meltdowns on the part of DS1.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe feel stuck between supporting DS1 in feeling safe at home and, at the same time, supporting DS2 to not have to be party to irrational rituals etc. DS1 is not happy with his &quot;anxieties&quot; as he calls them, and would like to change things, but we don&#39;t know how to help him. We have talked to him in a number of ways (magical thinking, primitive brain etc). We have the option of being referred to professionals again but are concerned that their methods are rooted in mainstream ideas, and we don&#39;t want to put ourselves in a position where we&#39;re clearly not coping but at the same time saying &quot;Yes but &quot; to the offered support.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have any ideas as to how we can help DS1 tackle these challenges? <br/>\n<br/>\nThanking you in advance,<br/>\nAlison<br/>\nDS1(9) and DS2(6)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63657,"nextTopicId":63661}}
