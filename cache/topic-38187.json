(These are <br/>\ncharcoal, not solar, and really easy to be successful.)<br/>\nOr you could make solar ovens out of pringles chips containers and <br/>\ncook hot dogs in them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoda bottle rockets are always a HUGE hit.<br/>\n<br/>\nBead stringing - sounds like a young children activity, but my <br/>\nexperience is that if you put out lots of variety of small beads, the <br/>\nteens will really enjoy making their own patterns, stringing them into <br/>\nnecklaces - boys, too. I was reminded of this because I just saw an <br/>\narticle about David Beckham (you know, British soccer player married <br/>\nto a spice girl - now plays for LA Galaxy) wearing beads that are <br/>\nsupposed to improve his sex life &lt;G&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; thanks - love the soap carving idea... oh, and candle making! i <br/>\n&gt; just thought of that...<br/>\n<br/>\nSoap carving is pretty hard - and quite a mess, so plan ahead. In <br/>\nfact, try it yourself first to get a feeling for what to expect. Maybe <br/>\ncertain kinds of soap work better than others. Consider what carving <br/>\ntools you&#39;ll have for people to use, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nA fun candlemaking activity is to dip water balloons. Fill them with a <br/>\nlittle water - maybe half a cup or a little more. Dip them into the <br/>\nmelted wax, let cool for a few seconds, dip again, cool, dip again. <br/>\nJust dip the bottom (water filled) of the balloon about an inch or two <br/>\ninto the wax. After you&#39;ve got a nice thick layer of wax on the <br/>\nballoon, let it cool thoroughly and then pop the balloon. It makes a <br/>\nlovely candle holder - put one of your regular dipped candles into it <br/>\nor buy a box full of votive or just tea candles to drop in. You can <br/>\ndip the edges in warm water and smooth them with your fingers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have done a lot of candle making, over the years, and this is a <br/>\nreal favorite.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo do regular dipped candles, everybody stand in line and take turns - <br/>\nfirst dip into the melted wax, then into a bucket of water. Then walk <br/>\naround to the end of the line and by the time they get back to the <br/>\nbeginning, it is time to dip again. Dipping into the water after they <br/>\ndip into the wax helps prevent them from dripping wax all over the <br/>\nplace. Remind them to dip straight down and straight up and let it <br/>\ndrip just a bit back into the melted wax.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe results are best if they just dip in and out - don&#39;t hold it in <br/>\nthe wax.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can use paraffin wax - if you add at least a bit of beeswax <br/>\n(expensive) it is very nice. You also need to add some stearic acid to <br/>\nmake the candles burn really well. You can buy colored wax cubes to <br/>\nmake the color - people always say you can add shaved crayons, but <br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t give a nice uniform color, it is grainy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother fun thing to do is buy up a bunch of different kinds of <br/>\ncontainers at thrift stores and pour wax into them.

(These are <br/>\n  charcoal, not solar, and really easy to be successful.)<br/>\n  Or you could make solar ovens out of pringles chips containers and <br/>\n  cook hot dogs in them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Soda bottle rockets are always a HUGE hit.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Bead stringing - sounds like a young children activity, but my <br/>\n  experience is that if you put out lots of variety of small beads, the <br/>\n  teens will really enjoy making their own patterns, stringing them into <br/>\n  necklaces - boys, too. I was reminded of this because I just saw an <br/>\n  article about David Beckham (you know, British soccer player married <br/>\n  to a spice girl - now plays for LA Galaxy) wearing beads that are <br/>\n  supposed to improve his sex life &lt;G&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; thanks - love the soap carving idea... oh, and candle making! i <br/>\n  &gt; just thought of that...<br/>\n<br/>\n  Soap carving is pretty hard - and quite a mess, so plan ahead. In <br/>\n  fact, try it yourself first to get a feeling for what to expect. Maybe <br/>\n  certain kinds of soap work better than others. Consider what carving <br/>\n  tools you&#39;ll have for people to use, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n  A fun candlemaking activity is to dip water balloons. Fill them with a <br/>\n  little water - maybe half a cup or a little more. Dip them into the <br/>\n  melted wax, let cool for a few seconds, dip again, cool, dip again. <br/>\n  Just dip the bottom (water filled) of the balloon about an inch or two <br/>\n  into the wax. After you&#39;ve got a nice thick layer of wax on the <br/>\n  balloon, let it cool thoroughly and then pop the balloon. It makes a <br/>\n  lovely candle holder - put one of your regular dipped candles into it <br/>\n  or buy a box full of votive or just tea candles to drop in. You can <br/>\n  dip the edges in warm water and smooth them with your fingers.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We have done a lot of candle making, over the years, and this is a <br/>\n  real favorite.<br/>\n<br/>\n  To do regular dipped candles, everybody stand in line and take turns - <br/>\n  first dip into the melted wax, then into a bucket of water. Then walk <br/>\n  around to the end of the line and by the time they get back to the <br/>\n  beginning, it is time to dip again. Dipping into the water after they <br/>\n  dip into the wax helps prevent them from dripping wax all over the <br/>\n  place. Remind them to dip straight down and straight up and let it <br/>\n  drip just a bit back into the melted wax.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The results are best if they just dip in and out - don&#39;t hold it in <br/>\n  the wax.<br/>\n<br/>\n  You can use paraffin wax - if you add at least a bit of beeswax <br/>\n  (expensive) it is very nice. You also need to add some stearic acid to <br/>\n  make the candles burn really well. You can buy colored wax cubes to <br/>\n  make the color - people always say you can add shaved crayons, but <br/>\n  that doesn&#39;t give a nice uniform color, it is grainy.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Another fun thing to do is buy up a bunch of different kinds of <br/>\n  containers at thrift stores and pour wax into them. Tie a little flat <br/>\n  washer to the wicking to weigh it down and keep it centered at the <br/>\n  bottom of the container and tie the top around a pencil that sits <br/>\n  across the top of the container, to keep the wicking upright. After <br/>\n  you&#39;ve poured and it has cooled down enough to hold it by the pencil/ <br/>\n  wick, you can dip the entire container just like dipping a candle, so <br/>\n  that when it burns, it burns down the inside of the container and <br/>\n  leaves the wax on the outside. You can use different colors - the <br/>\n  candle light will shine through the exterior wax - really pretty.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Also you can dip a little and then press flower petals or leaves or <br/>\n  other flatish things into the wax and then dip a little over them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185586397,"authorName":"Lyla Wolfenstein","from":"&quot;Lyla Wolfenstein&quot; &lt;lylaw@...&gt;","profile":"lylawolf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] ideas for group activites for older kids","postDate":"1221256383","msgId":38225,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU4OTcyRUQwNUVCMzRDRUJBMEMzNjNDRkQ0OTA0QTFEQExZTEFMQVAyPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDlmNzJkNzYyMDgwOTEyMTI0OWwzMjQ4YjVjM2sxYTIxZWVlODU2MjBjYjAxQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdhZHZ1aStsdmRjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8OTE2MENEQ0YtMUM2My00NDMyLTg3NTUtQTk3MjUzQkRBRkVFQHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8MEE1MkY4Nzk0NEM2NDhBRkE4NEIzQzZENDJERTNCNkVATFlMQUxBUDI+IDw5ZjcyZDc2MjA4MDkxMjEyNDlsMzI0OGI1YzNrMWEyMWVlZTg1NjIwY2IwMUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":38224,"nextInTopic":38226,"prevInTime":38224,"nextInTime":38226,"topicId":38187,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"those look really cool! thanks! ...

In  <br/>\nfact, try it yourself first to get a feeling for what to expect. Maybe  <br/>\ncertain kinds of soap work better than others. Consider what carving  <br/>\ntools you&#39;ll have for people to use, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nA fun candlemaking activity is to dip water balloons. Fill them with a  <br/>\nlittle water - maybe half a cup or a little more. Dip them into the  <br/>\nmelted wax, let cool for a few seconds, dip again, cool, dip again.  <br/>\nJust dip the bottom (water filled) of the balloon about an inch or two  <br/>\ninto the wax. After you&#39;ve got a nice thick layer of wax on the  <br/>\nballoon, let it cool thoroughly and then pop the balloon. It makes a  <br/>\nlovely candle holder - put one of your regular dipped candles into it  <br/>\nor buy a box full of votive or just tea candles to drop in. You can  <br/>\ndip the edges in warm water and smooth them with your fingers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have done a lot of candle making, over the years, and this is a  <br/>\nreal favorite.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo do regular dipped candles, everybody stand in line and take turns -  <br/>\nfirst dip into the melted wax, then into a bucket of water. Then walk  <br/>\naround to the end of the line and by the time they get back to the  <br/>\nbeginning, it is time to dip again. Dipping into the water after they  <br/>\ndip into the wax helps prevent them from dripping wax all over the  <br/>\nplace. Remind them to dip straight down and straight up and let it  <br/>\ndrip just a bit back into the melted wax.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe results are best if they just dip in and out - don&#39;t hold it in  <br/>\nthe wax.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can use paraffin wax - if you add at least a bit of beeswax  <br/>\n(expensive) it is very nice. You also need to add some stearic acid to  <br/>\nmake the candles burn really well. You can buy colored wax cubes to  <br/>\nmake the color - people always say you can add shaved crayons, but  <br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t give a nice uniform color, it is grainy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother fun thing to do is buy up a bunch of different kinds of  <br/>\ncontainers at thrift stores and pour wax into them. Tie a little flat  <br/>\nwasher to the wicking to weigh it down and keep it centered at the  <br/>\nbottom of the container and tie the top around a pencil that sits  <br/>\nacross the top of the container, to keep the wicking upright. After  <br/>\nyou&#39;ve poured and it has cooled down enough to hold it by the pencil/ <br/>\nwick, you can dip the entire container just like dipping a candle, so  <br/>\nthat when it burns, it burns down the inside of the container and  <br/>\nleaves the wax on the outside. You can use different colors - the  <br/>\ncandle light will shine through the exterior wax - really pretty.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso you can dip a little and then press flower petals or leaves or  <br/>\nother flatish things into the wax and then dip a little over them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] ideas for group activites for older kids","postDate":"1221245918","msgId":38212,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgwOTEyMTE1OGgyYzA1YjcyYmw0ZmJmOWU3OTNlYTAxMjk2QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEU5ODBGMzcxM0E4NzRGNEM5RDBGNjQ3NjFGQkVENjY2QExZTEFMQVAyPg==","referencesHeader":"PDMxMTE5Ljc2OTIwLnFtQHdlYjMwMDA2Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4JIDxFOTgwRjM3MTNBODc0RjRDOUQwRjY0NzYxRkJFRDY2NkBMWUxBTEFQMj4="},"prevInTopic":38211,"nextInTopic":38213,"prevInTime":38211,"nextInTime":38213,"topicId":38187,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Making root beer from sarsaparilla. ~Katherine ...

I recommended Rue&#39;s books and a<br/>\ncouple of others and left it at that. <br/>\n<br/>\nI thought I remembered my question as one that was regularly asked,<br/>\nwith no answer.  The lack of an answer was a good reminder that<br/>\nempirical evidence someday isn&#39;t the point -- full, happy lives today<br/>\nis the point of it all.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylvia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185586397,"authorName":"Lyla Wolfenstein","from":"&quot;Lyla Wolfenstein&quot; &lt;lylaw@...&gt;","profile":"lylawolf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"ideas for group activites for older kids","postDate":"1221239321","msgId":38198,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBBNTJGODc5NDRDNjQ4QUZBODRCM0M2RDQyREUzQjZFQExZTEFMQVAyPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDkxNjBDRENGLTFDNjMtNDQzMi04NzU1LUE5NzI1M0JEQUZFRUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGdhZHZ1aStsdmRjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8OTE2MENEQ0YtMUM2My00NDMyLTg3NTUtQTk3MjUzQkRBRkVFQHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38195,"nextInTopic":38200,"prevInTime":38197,"nextInTime":38199,"topicId":38187,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"i am looking for input/creative ideas for casual (of course non-didactic) fun activities for 5-11 year olds (but  mostly 8-11) - who are past playdough and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-941323865\">i am looking for input/creative ideas for casual (of course non-didactic) fun activities for 5-11 year olds (but  mostly 8-11) - who are past playdough and park days for the most part....<br/>\n<br/>\ni&#39;d like to host something at my house, especially during the rainy winter.  here are my ideas so far (some from other people)- would love any others - tried and true or just brainstormed!<br/>\n<br/>\n- cookie invention: give the kids (and adults!) the basic ingredient info for what needs to be in a cookie, and then a bunch of items to choose from for creating their own flavors/mix-ins....and let them go at it.  we can bake one of each person&#39;s cookie in my limited oven space, and everyone can take the rest of their dough home for baking later...<br/>\n<br/>\n- gingerbread/candy house creation - maybe during the holidays we can all go see the AMAZING candy houses on display at pioneer place (at least that&#39;s where they were a few years ago - i will look into it) and then host our own...<br/>\n<br/>\n- duct tape inventions (maybe - my son got really frustrated trying to make  a duct tape wallet recently, so not sure he would go for that)<br/>\n<br/>\n- &quot;take it apart&quot; - everyone brings an appliance or something to take apart/dismantel, in their own way/for their own reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\n- paper airplanes<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] who said it?","postDate":"1221237132","msgId":38195,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkxNjBDRENGLTFDNjMtNDQzMi04NzU1LUE5NzI1M0JEQUZFRUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdhZHZ1aStsdmRjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdhZHZ1aStsdmRjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38187,"nextInTopic":38198,"prevInTime":38194,"nextInTime":38196,"topicId":38187,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I m trying who said/wrote the statement (and I m paraphrasing here) that a teenager who wants to/is read can learn in about 18 months, what takes 12 yrs to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1446121463\">-=-I&#39;m trying who said/wrote the statement (and I&#39;m paraphrasing here)<br/>\nthat a teenager who wants to/is read can learn in about 18 months,<br/>\nwhat takes 12 yrs to teach in schools. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve written that I remember Holt having said, but I don&#39;t know  <br/>\nwhere.  Every few years I&#39;ve asked, as you did, where it came from.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t just about reading, though.  It was that EVERYthing they  <br/>\nteach in public school can be learned by a teen in 18 months.  And  <br/>\nthink about it... high school or college students who come here from  <br/>\ncountries with a completely different system of writing and a  <br/>\ndifferent culture can be academically &quot;up to speed&quot; in a  year or two.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone moves to an English-speaking country from Spain or Italy  <br/>\nand learns English well enough to take college courses, that&#39;s not as  <br/>\nimpressive as someone who comes from China or Japan or India and has  <br/>\nto learn a whole  new system of writing (well, college-prepped kids  <br/>\nfrom India probably could read English, at least, if not write  <br/>\ncursively, and increasingly  kids from China are learning English).    <br/>\nBut my point is that even someone who comes from a different culture  <br/>\nwho has to learn to read our writing and to write it down, to spell  <br/>\npassably, and to write legibly, learns it within a year or two.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHow much more easily could a native English speaker who has no  <br/>\nculture shock to overcome (knows how to use the bathroom plumbing and  <br/>\nto order in a restaurant already; knows how to buy food at the store  <br/>\nalready) pick up all the details of how to write mathematical  <br/>\nnotation and to punctuate?   And enough history and geography to  <br/>\nfollow the news is EASY to pick up if you&#39;re from that culture, but  <br/>\nthose from other cultures do pretty well at it too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":180234378,"authorName":"Sylvia Toyama","from":"&quot;Sylvia Toyama&quot; &lt;sylgt04@...&gt;","profile":"sylgt04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"who said it?","postDate":"1221231378","msgId":38187,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdhZHZ1aStsdmRjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":38195,"prevInTime":38186,"nextInTime":38188,"topicId":38187,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m trying who said/wrote the statement (and I m paraphrasing here) that a teenager who wants to/is read can learn in about 18 months, what takes 12 yrs to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1082990656\">I&#39;m trying who said/wrote the statement (and I&#39;m paraphrasing here)<br/>\nthat a teenager who wants to/is read can learn in about 18 months,<br/>\nwhat takes 12 yrs to teach in schools.
