I was so bummed about it at the time that I <br/>\nalmost bought one of the cabinets solely for the sake of nostalgia. I still miss <br/>\nthem in many ways - no more serendipitous finds while riffling through a <br/>\ndrawer, and subject searches seem much harder to me, I still can&#39;t scan screens as <br/>\nfast or as easily as I had learned to scan cards. But I wouldn&#39;t willingly <br/>\ngive up the computer catalogs at this point. I can search the holdings of not <br/>\nonly my own library but 26 other libraries in the same cooperative system, and <br/>\nput books on hold from any of them from my home. At midnight. On Sunday. &lt;g&gt; I <br/>\ncan keep the catalog page open as I read unschooling lists so I can quickly <br/>\nfind and order recommended books without having to try to remember titles or <br/>\nwrite myself a note I&#39;ll forget to take to the library with me. I can search the <br/>\nholdings of every single library in the state of Illinois and send an email to <br/>\nmy reference librarian requesting an interlibrary loan, right here from my <br/>\ncomfy chair, and it will show up at my library with my name on it usually within <br/>\na few days. What luxury!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 13 year olds don&#39;t know how to use card catalogs, but they do know how to <br/>\ndo computer catalog searches very well. AND they both memorized their 14 digit <br/>\nlibrary card codes in order to place to their own reserves by the time they <br/>\nwere 9. :) <br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone mentioned browsing other&#39;s selections on the reserve shelf - you <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t do that here. The one local library that puts reserves out on a public <br/>\nshelf for pickup wraps the whole book in white paper before labeling it with the <br/>\npatron&#39;s name. I guess someone complained about privacy...<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":10590565,"authorName":"conniecolten@aol.com","from":"conniecolten@...","profile":"conniecolten","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: card catalog","postDate":"1120664740","msgId":22709,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExLjQ4OTk0YzkyLjJmZmQ1NmE0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":22740,"prevInTime":22708,"nextInTime":22710,"topicId":22709,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/6/2005 7:56:22 AM Pacific Standard Time, AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com writes: So,  Connie, are you saying I should get OVER it?
