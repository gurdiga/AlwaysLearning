What choice do they have?  If they stop believing <br/>\nthat, then their children are wasting time in school. <br/>\n<br/>\nMany years ago someone explained to me that parents who were spanked as <br/>\nchildren have to go on spanking as parents themselves.  IF they say that <br/>\nspanking is wrong, then they are admitting that what their parents, whom <br/>\nthey love and trust, were wrong.  Many people cannot admit that their <br/>\nparents would make such a wrong choice, a choice that physically and <br/>\nemotionally hurt them as children and as adults, and a choice that they <br/>\nare making and that perpetuates that violence on their own children.  So <br/>\nthey go on living the lie, hurting their own children...<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool is like that.  There is a myth that in order to be successful one <br/>\nmust go through the process--k-12, all the right classes, college prep, <br/>\nstandardized tests, scoring high, sports or other activities, etc.  then <br/>\ncollege...  If this is all wrong, then the parents wasted their own time <br/>\nin school, as their children are wasting theirs now...<br/>\n<br/>\nYears ago I realized that many students were being taught math, the same <br/>\nmath, over and over.  It was as though if we repeat a thing often enough <br/>\nstudents who were not cognitively ready to get something would get it <br/>\nanyway.  Instead, we have a lot of students who have no understanding of <br/>\nmath failing at higher math.  Those millions of problems they did as <br/>\nchildren did not help them gain understanding.  It was just busy work <br/>\nand memorization.  Years ago I took kids who had failed at math for <br/>\nyears and in two or three months taught them basic math--1st grade <br/>\nthrough 9th grade math, without them doing hundreds of practice <br/>\nproblems.  I learned that if a student was ready to learn something, it <br/>\ncould be learned quick, without all those practice problems.  The next <br/>\nstep in my thinking was that if people just waited until a student was <br/>\nready to learn something and wanting to learn it, and had a reason to do <br/>\nso, then maybe all that practice was unnecessary.  So, this led me to <br/>\nrealize--all those problems I did, every day, hundreds a week, every <br/>\nweek, for every grade, for 12 years--that was unnecessary.  A waste of <br/>\nmy time!  It was hard to admit that. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I guess my point is that these parents, and their children, MUST buy <br/>\ninto the idea that school, graduation, college, graduation, etc. are the <br/>\nONLY way to success.  For them to accept their are alternatives that <br/>\nwould be less difficult for their children would make all they have done <br/>\nand all their children have done, and will do, a waste of time, is too <br/>\nmuch for them to comprehend. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; &gt; Maybe school *does* seem like a better option!&gt;I&#39;m not sure what to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>say to that because obviously that is not all that she does, and <br/>\ncertainly we are involved in activities with the whole family as well as <br/>\nunschooling stuff when my husband is atwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee, I think this bothers me...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t unschool from 9-5.

I&#39;m a newly single mom, with younger children, <br/>\ntrying to continue a life style that isn&#39;t easily compatible with me <br/>\nworking full time out of the home.  The divorce and Lexie&#39;s medical <br/>\nsituation has made it even more interesting.  I&#39;ve had to let go of <br/>\n&quot;what will others think?&quot; and have simply done the best I could.  <br/>\nSending my kids to school was certainly not my first choice, but we all <br/>\ndid it, and we came out of the experience with knowledge and skills we <br/>\notherwise would not have.  And I&#39;ll tell you, Janene did not learn to <br/>\nread in school, in fact, I can&#39;t think of one typically educational <br/>\nthing my children and I learned from that experience, but it was <br/>\ncertainly a valuable experience all around.  School did not destroy my <br/>\nchildren, it did not destroy our life, it did not change how we think as <br/>\nunschoolers.  I would not undo that time period, it was a good <br/>\nexperience and only cemented our feelings about education and life and <br/>\nunschooling.  Do I want my children to go to school again?  No, I really <br/>\ndon&#39;t, but it may be that Janene will go to school this year, in <br/>\nSeptember.  I will do what I can to make the experience a good one for <br/>\nher, we will continue to unschool through it all, and school will simply <br/>\nbe a place she hangs out while mom has to work.  I am trying to get her <br/>\ninto an alternative charter school, but if I can&#39;t do that, she will go <br/>\nto a traditional school.  This is simply where we are right now in our <br/>\nlives, in a few more years my children will be old enough for this not <br/>\nto be an issue. But anyway, back to the original point, I just simply <br/>\nhave given up the idea to be the ideal anything, to be the ideal radical <br/>\nunschooler, to be the ideal mommy, to be the ideal teacher.  Instead, <br/>\nI&#39;m doing the best I can. I&#39;ve given up caring what other people think.<br/>\n<br/>\nI should say that Lexie had been talking of going to school for years.  <br/>\nEach time we discussed it, pros and cons, and she would put it off, <br/>\nsaying maybe she would go the next year.  I always let her make the <br/>\ndecisions.  As a public school teacher, she knew I had real insight to <br/>\nthe school situation, but I always talked about the positives as well as <br/>\nthe negatives.  Janene also was very curious, but had also decided not <br/>\nto go.  When as a family we decided that we would try school as an <br/>\nanswer to that problem, they both had mixed feelings but were excited to <br/>\nsee what it was all about.  Lexie left school gladly, it was very much a <br/>\nnegative experience for her.  Janene was OK with it, and will be OK with <br/>\ngoing back. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do agree that children who know--well Sandra said choice, my kids <br/>\ndidn&#39;t really have a choice, but they knew I backed their every second.  <br/>\nThey could tell me everything, and KNOW, in their hearts, that I would <br/>\ndo what I could for them.  That gave them far more power than most kids, <br/>\nover their situation.  And as we went through the experience, they also <br/>\nknew that I would take them out if they really wanted it.  This power <br/>\nwas so important to them.  Most kids don&#39;t know there is another <br/>\noption.  I teach those kids every day.  They are so brainwashed into the <br/>\nprocess they think has to happen--grades K-12, in the proper order, <br/>\ntaking classes in the proper order, with every step dictated, every test <br/>\nmandatory, that they don&#39;t see, don&#39;t understand, that it&#39;s all a sham.  <br/>\nThat there are other things they can do instead of following the &quot;steps&quot; <br/>\ndictated by the school.  My kids know they can choose different paths.  <br/>\nSo for them, their time in school was different.  It was easier.  Lexie <br/>\nwould come home and laugh at the things adult staff had said or done, <br/>\nbecause she saw the world in a different light.  It was interesting for <br/>\nher to understand this, and also to hear her talk about it.  She gained <br/>\ninsight into the kids that weren&#39;t homeschooled and their thinking.  It <br/>\nwas enlightening to her and she talked  about how that experience helped <br/>\nher to understand other children better. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I&#39;m rambling, but I guess my main idea is that school wasn&#39;t <br/>\nnecessarily bad for my kids, and they came out of it educated.  Not in <br/>\nthe way the school would think, but not in a bad way either.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\nPS, i just asked Lexie if she learned anything in school, clarifying it <br/>\nwith the words &quot;as in what the school wanted you to learn.&quot;  She said <br/>\n&quot;as in the lessons?&quot;  I said yes and she thought for a long time... then <br/>\nsaid &quot;I learned how to spell awesome.&quot;  After much more quiet thought, <br/>\nshe said &quot;I learned about the local Native Americans, the ones who used <br/>\nto live around here.  We learned th is in two days.
