Yup so cool.  And that came just from her love of  <br/>\nhandwriting and drawing.  I figured that since my oldest son taught  <br/>\nhimself to read at 2 1/2 that she would have to be taught.  Now I  <br/>\nknow though and every kid learns when left in freedom in their own  <br/>\ntime and own pace.  What a joy to see happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nRaven<br/>\nhttp:scatterville.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I joined because I am unschooling<br/>\n&gt; my kids again after a brief lapse of my common sense thinking they<br/>\n&gt; needed a set curriculum to learn.  Actually it was my fear of having<br/>\n&gt; to teach my kindergartener how to read.  I know now what I have<br/>\n&gt; always known, she will learn when she is ready and not a moment<br/>\n&gt; before and she will teach herself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Mar 14, 2006, at 8:47 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Raven, you&#39;re already calm, but for the benefit of anyone who read<br/>\n&gt; that paragraph and felt a knot in the stomach, I wanted to use it as<br/>\n&gt; a jumping off place to throw this link out:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/reading\">http://sandradodd.com/reading</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And here&#39;s one just as a reminder that learning doesn&#39;t need reading:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/museum\">http://sandradodd.com/museum</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24738,"nextTopicId":24746}}
