This year both got a bunch. They<br/>\ncame home and spread it out, we checked it over, and then they spent quite a<br/>\nbit of time trading off what they didn&#39;t want. I was proud of both of them,<br/>\nthe oldest restrained some of her overbearing ways and didn&#39;t take advantage<br/>\nand the youngest was civil and generous with her trades too. They laid them<br/>\nout and the youngest piled them up and made structures out of them (cuisenaire<br/>\ntraining at work) and they ate -- a lot! More than I thought they should be I<br/>\nkept my mouth shut. The youngest started feeling a bit sick. Not real bad. And<br/>\nthat was it. Next day a piece or two. And the same since... and I imagine,<br/>\njust like years before, I will be throwing out Halloween candy around Easter<br/>\nthat just never got eaten. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe did something fun this year too. For Fourth of July, I bought a bunch of<br/>\nglow sticks on ebay for pretty cheap. They don&#39;t last forever and we still had<br/>\na lot left so as we walked around Trick or Treating I gave out glow sticks to<br/>\nkids we saw or to the people handing out candy.
