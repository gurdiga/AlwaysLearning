Invite him over, and then hit him.&quot;   And Marty would say,  <br/>\n&quot;Yeah?  I&#39;m not going to your eighteenth birthday party, Holly.&quot;  She  <br/>\nwas seven, nine, eleven years old in those days.  Then they stopped  <br/>\ndiscussing it. &lt;g&gt;  It was good to diffuse many situations, even when  <br/>\nthey were honestly angry.  One time Holly clenched her fists and  <br/>\nyelled &quot;I can&#39;t wait &#39;til I&#39;m 18!!&quot;  We all got it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that time she became seriously fond of Marty.  She totally  <br/>\nadmires him and is proud to be his sister.  And in the past year or  <br/>\nso she took an interest in Kirby and started seeing good things about  <br/>\nhim, whereas before he had irritated her, and sometimes not been as  <br/>\nnice to her as Marty was.   She even said &quot;Kirby&#39;s my favorite  <br/>\nbrother&quot; once last summer, which surprised us both.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think that would be as likely to have happened if I had spent  <br/>\na lot of energy trying to make them be friends.  I didn&#39;t.  I helped  <br/>\nthem find separate things to do, and helped them not feel trapped  <br/>\nwith the siblings.  Hundreds of times, Keith or I took the least  <br/>\nsatisfied of the three out away from the house for one reason or  <br/>\nanother, real or trumped up, so the other two could relax and the  <br/>\nangry or frustrated one could express herself or himself at length  <br/>\n(or not, as she chose).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen one of the younger ones would say &quot;Kirby&#39;s stupid&quot; or &quot;I hate  <br/>\nKirby,&quot; I would express sympathy and maybe slight agreement or  <br/>\nacknowledgement that he could be irritating, and it must be hard  <br/>\nhaving a brother so &quot;out there&quot; and sociable and sometimes  <br/>\ninsensitive, and I was sorry, and what could I do to make the moment  <br/>\nbetter, but I would always point out some of this:  while I  <br/>\nunderstood their frustration, I really loved Kirby, and that Kirby  <br/>\nwould have been an only child if not for them, and for me having more  <br/>\nchildren, and so they might want to cut him some slack because his  <br/>\nideal life was interrupted by their presence.  I did the &quot;on the  <br/>\nother hand&quot; commentary, at least a little.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr I&#39;d handle it with humor.  The Marty-to-Kirby humor, starting when  <br/>\nthey were very young, involved my offer to smite Kirby.  &quot;Kirby&#39;s not  <br/>\nsharing.&quot;  &quot;Shall I smite him?&quot;  &quot;Yes!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I would go to Kirby and say &quot;Marty wishes me to smite you,  <br/>\nKirby.

The first two are really about  <br/>\ngovernment, but I guess we could stretch it to mean lack of authority  <br/>\nof the adults over the kids. If we did that, I&#39;d want to talk about  <br/>\nauthentic authority as opposed to purely political authority and all  <br/>\nthat, because I do think there is authority - we may choose, as  <br/>\nadults, not to use our (political) authority to oppress our kids, but  <br/>\nwe have it, nonetheless. AND we have a lot of natural authority just  <br/>\nby virtue of living longer and having had the chance to learn a lot  <br/>\nabout what makes life good and because our kids are dependent on us  <br/>\nin very real ways. What we do AS unschooling parents is to set things  <br/>\nup so that there isn&#39;t the disorder and confusion of anarchy - we are  <br/>\nthe ones who have determined that there are important principles we  <br/>\nwant to live by, those are the organizing principles in our family  <br/>\nlives, and we&#39;re modeling and supporting the appreciation of those  <br/>\nsame principles in our children.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe third meaning of anarchy - absence of any cohesive principles,  <br/>\nsuch as a common standard or purpose -- THAT is truly the opposite of  <br/>\nwhat I think of as life in an unschooling family. I think that is  <br/>\nwhat people sometimes miss - they get the idea of not being the  <br/>\nequivalent of an oppressive government, but they don&#39;t get that there  <br/>\nIS something else, guiding principles that bring order and purpose to  <br/>\nlife, and that they, the parents, need to find ways for the whole  <br/>\nfamily to live together according to those principles.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra repeatedly points out that the best way to do this is to live  <br/>\nit yourself - treat the kids kindly and they learn to be kind, etc. I  <br/>\nthink some people brush this aside as too pat an answer or something.  <br/>\nIt really IS the most significant thing parents can do.

FIRST, I&#39;m a realist---and <br/>\nrealistic enough to know that anarchy works only if everyone&#39;s on board <br/>\nwith no other meddling agenda! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf everyone is working towards the same gentle, peaceful, trusting, <br/>\nrespectful principles, then anarchy works great. But when someone comes <br/>\nin with a rusty sword---the idea of taking over the world or having <br/>\neverything *his* way...well, then we get a chink in our armor. Every <br/>\npoke, every jab weakens the solidity our little anarchy requires.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you see your household as a place where every one can get what he <br/>\nneeds/wants, then it&#39;s working! Anarchy &quot;rules&quot; here because it <br/>\nworks---we&#39;re  all in it for the long haul. We each want the best---for <br/>\neach other and for ourselves. It works.<br/>\n<br/>\nPunishment can only happen when *someone* is ruling---when someone has <br/>\nthe power and the need to control others.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":208913951,"authorName":"Bridget","from":"&quot;Bridget&quot; &lt;razemfamily@...&gt;","profile":"bridgetvic1964","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Anarchy or Punishment","postDate":"1145899977","msgId":25423,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUyajI0OStucmVpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":25427,"prevInTime":25422,"nextInTime":25424,"topicId":25423,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I can honestly say that there have been days when I could of poked my own  eyes out in sheer frustration,days when I think I understood why some animals ate","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-878173537\">I can honestly say that there have been days when I could of poked my <br/>\nown  eyes out in sheer frustration,days when I think I understood why <br/>\nsome animals ate their young:)and these were, and still are the times <br/>\nwhere I tread lightly.Experience has taught me alot about myself and <br/>\nmy limitations,in moments when stuff gets tense.Punishment is a <br/>\nbig &#39;ol word,and is highly charged,at it&#39;s least full of shame,at it&#39;s <br/>\nworst.....:-(  Anarchy,my little anarchists,beautiful and strong,full <br/>\nof themselves in away only children can be.I do step in when things <br/>\nget hairy with the kids,because I am there mother and I feel that part <br/>\nof my role is to give them tools to use in times of conflict show them <br/>\nan alternative until they discover something that works better for <br/>\nthem.This said I am so far from where I am going as a parent that when <br/>\nI have discovered one fine method to share with the world on child <br/>\nrearing I will have forgotten long ago what it was we were talking <br/>\nabout.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25367,"nextTopicId":25656}}
