I hadn&#39;t heard of it<br/>\nbefore that. We *all* love it�including me. We too go in waves of playing it<br/>\nintensely (sometimes just one or two of us; sometimes the crowd) and then it<br/>\nwill sit for a while. My 10-at-the-time daughter printed out a whole binder<br/>\nfull of information about the game�what presents to give which characters<br/>\nfor facilitating courtships; how to make various recipes; how to get the<br/>\nwild animals to become your pets, etc. I could probably fill another binder<br/>\nwith the contents of the discussions we&#39;ve had as a result of playing that<br/>\ngame, everything from mapmaking (something else the kids did, made maps of<br/>\nthe island) to marriage customs to farming. Oh!! I forgot, too, the intense<br/>\nmath calculating I see the kids doing as they compare profit margins on<br/>\ncrops.

Or is he slower and more  <br/>\ncautious with his learning, and take time to master things....what  <br/>\nother learning situations can you derive some valuable insights from  <br/>\nthat will apply to this situation, and give you comfort that yes, in  <br/>\nfact, he will master it, in his own time?<br/>\n<br/>\nI can certainly appreciate your concern, we have an 11.5 yo who is  <br/>\njust beginning to learn to read herself.  At this age, I can only  <br/>\nimagine that you&#39;ve received a lot of outside pressure yourself, in  <br/>\nthe form of inquiries from friends and family.  We certainly have, and  <br/>\nat times, it&#39;s been difficult to be the one to remain confident that  <br/>\nyes, in fact, it will happen, and to absorb all of that concern with  <br/>\nconfidence and aplomb.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur daughter has also just decided to pursue learning to read a little  <br/>\nbit more seriously.  This has taken the form of looking at flash cards  <br/>\nwith letters on them, and learning the sounds.  This was her specific  <br/>\nrequest.  She felt that if she understood the sounds, she would be  <br/>\nable to figure out words most easily herself.  This came from  <br/>\ndiscussion over months.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is now starting to read certain words, mostly on the television  <br/>\nprogramming display, also on World of Warcraft, and in some other  <br/>\nplaces in our day-to-day life.  The .<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve witnessed with our younger daughter, 9, who is a little bit  <br/>\nahead, is that the list of words that she could read was very small  <br/>\nfor quite some time, perhaps 10-20 words, like yes, no, family names,  <br/>\npet names, etc.  When the list of words begins to grow, it moves  <br/>\nslowly, but then begins to snowball, going faster and faster, gaining  <br/>\nmomentum.  It is now starting to happen for our 11.5 year old.  I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t expect her to begin reading books yet, simply to continue to be  <br/>\nable to read the information around her more and more each day.  Books  <br/>\nwill come when she is ready.  She was able to sit and listen to the  <br/>\nentire Twilight series, in long 8-10 hour stretches, so I&#39;m confident  <br/>\nthat she will ultimately be reading books that she loves on her own in  <br/>\nlong stretches also.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, hope that is helpful in some way.

Its a huge issue, because schools can&#39;t wrap their heads around the concept of reading without phonics. For Deaf kids, the letters don&#39;t necessarily have sounds (that might come, but only after years and years of oral training), but they have shape and, if they&#39;re learning fingerspelling, they have corresponding 3-dimensional hand shapes. But, turns out that Deaf kids learn to read best if they learn to sign well, first. And they associate written words with their signs, not with the sounds or shapes of the individual letters that make up the word. Deaf readers are more likely to confuse, for example, the written words, &quot;tea&quot; and &quot;vote,&quot; because their ASL signs are very similar, than to confuse &quot;pea&quot; and &quot;tea&quot; which are phonetically more similar but have dissimilar ASL signs.&quot;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; -pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>when my oldest son was 5.

Its a huge issue, because schools can&#39;t wrap their heads around the concept of reading without phonics. For Deaf kids, the letters don&#39;t necessarily have sounds (that might come, but only after years and years of oral training), but they have shape and, if they&#39;re learning fingerspelling, they have corresponding 3-dimensional hand shapes. But, turns out that Deaf kids learn to read best if they learn to sign well, first. And they associate written words with their signs, not with the sounds or shapes of the individual letters that make up the word. Deaf readers are more likely to confuse, for example, the written words, &quot;tea&quot; and &quot;vote,&quot; because their ASL signs are very similar, than to confuse &quot;pea&quot; and &quot;tea&quot; which are phonetically more similar but have dissimilar ASL signs.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":272603634,"authorName":"Melissa Wiley","from":"Melissa Wiley &lt;thebonnyglen@...&gt;","profile":"glencaraid","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: reading : how long to wait?","postDate":"1269375404","msgId":52285,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI2ODRlMmZhMTAwMzIzMTMxNnI0YTY0NTQ1Y3A3YTRmMGRlOTVlYWQzNGNhQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEVGRUNEREFBLTBCQjgtNDQ3Qy05MDE3LTc0RkY1MDRGMzQ2MkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGhvOXV2cyt2MmxzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgkgPEVGRUNEREFBLTBCQjgtNDQ3Qy05MDE3LTc0RkY1MDRGMzQ2MkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":52284,"nextInTopic":52288,"prevInTime":52284,"nextInTime":52286,"topicId":52269,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Does he have any oral/aural language issues? Don&#39;t answer here - perhaps mull it over yourself. Usually kids with auditory processing issues have trouble with receptive listening, not reading (although the phoneme awareness thing can be a factor). Also, in my honest and humble opinion, there&#39;s a lot of snake oil out there in terms of treating auditory processing. Your best bet is a Speech and Language Pathologist who will assess and make recommendations, if you think that&#39;s warranted. I&#39;ve looked at the HSLDA page and I think that many of their symptoms are far too global - I can see that a lot of &quot;false positive&quot; self-diagnoses could result. (Link for anyone else who wants to look at it: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hslda.org/strugglinglearner/sn_auditory.asp)\">http://www.hslda.org/strugglinglearner/sn_auditory.asp)</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are people in the world with a true, brain-based dyslexia (which can be determined by a proper psychoeducational assessment administered by a registered psychologist -- so, not an inexpensive option and one that can be highly stressful for kids). Just like everybody else, they have to make sense of reading in their own way. I&#39;ve seen parents spend oodles of money for interventions that really didn&#39;t speed up the process that much (although some may disagree with me). And it is possible that his learning-to-read pace is still developmental/emotional for your son. If so, simply waiting, if *he* is cool with that, won&#39;t hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nA friend of mine told me a story about one of her adult friends who has severe dyslexia: he can read, but it took him a while to sort it out (even when in school) and it took focus/desire on his part to put it together. He doesn&#39;t read for pleasure but he can certainly make his way through the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I can&#39;t say enough about quality graphic novels for kids who are just on the cusp of reading. If he wants to read, strew these around and the pictorial clues may be helpful and lessen any frustration he may be feeling (if he is feeling any frustration).<br/>\n<br/>\n- Rebecca</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287815876,"authorName":"RobynC","from":"&quot;RobynC&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"designarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: reading : how long to wait?","postDate":"1269330141","msgId":52271,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhvOXJjdCtpZXBkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhvOWk4YSt2azd0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":52270,"nextInTopic":52273,"prevInTime":52270,"nextInTime":52272,"topicId":52269,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"===All the while i m thinking,  well, as an unschooler he will get it when his brain develops to that place.

She just slowly got better at it and needed less help, in many small jumps. They were jumps too.

She still finds reading hard work, so she didn&#39;t realize that it was relaxing and easy for me. I had to think about it to understand what was upsetting her.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

The thing is he seems to really stuggle with reading over and over again and when i&#39;ve read so many stories about unschoolers who begin getting it and take off seemingly overnight i have to wonder.***<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat kinds of things are you doing to help him read?  It sounds like you are helping him with some sort of reading program or workbooks or such.  Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but the way you&#39;ve described it caused me to think that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest started really reading at about the age of 11.  Before that time, everything she did led up to that point.  When she played games online or on the PS2 or her DS, or gameboy for that matter, she would ask what something said and we&#39;d tell her.  It was that simple.  When she wanted to spell something we&#39;d spell it for her.  Over time of doing that, and reading aloud to her and listening to books on tape and on cd, receiving b-day cards with notes, and letters from friends, and looking up things online, she eventually knew enough words to be able to string them together.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were just talking about this last night.  Margaux, currently 8, has been playing hang man with anyone who is willing and able.  She likes 4 letter words right now (and yes, some of &quot;those&quot; words get into the mix).  Last night I held the word &quot;eyes&quot; while she guessed.  She had every letter but the &quot;s&quot; and she still didn&#39;t get it.  Chamille, currently 15, was sitting there next to her at the table trying to give her hints and clues.  Then she said, &quot;Margaux that&#39;s such and easy word, how come you didn&#39;t get that one?&quot;  She really didn&#39;t understand how that was a hard word.  So, we all talked about phonics and the crazy way in which the English language doesn&#39;t follow phonics very easily.  The word &quot;eyes&quot; was just one of many examples.<br/>\n<br/>\nChamille didn&#39;t know what phonics was, so I explained it to her and she said, &quot;oh, that never made sense to me.&quot;  I told her that I knew that and I explained to her how I saw how she learned how to read, and how she would ask what a word was and then she&#39;d rarely ask about that word ever again because once she knew it, she knew it, and eventually she knew enough to read.  She confirmed that to be true and said that she is still like that with new words, once she sees it and knows it, she knows it for good.  (she rarely misspells a word too, except the few that are the same but spelled different based on context and meaning, but even those ones she&#39;s really getting better with) Then, since Margaux was there listening in on all of it, we talked about phonics a bit, because Margaux really DOES get the whole sounding out of words and figuring out what a word is, by the sounds the letters make.  The word &quot;eyes&quot; doesn&#39;t sound at all like it&#39;s spelled and we<br/>\n talked about that, and I admitted to giving her that word on purpose to throw her a doozy which also had the letter &quot;y&quot;, which is a letter that&#39;s way down the list in a game of hang man.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, before going to some specialist, think about how your son IS reading and understanding the written word.  If you can figure that out, you&#39;ll have a much bigger piece of the puzzle to be able to help him in a way that really does work for him.  Do you play word games at all?  Hang man is really pretty fun, so is Wheel of Fortune, which to me is a version of hang man done all with pizzazz and money.  We have lots of alphabet letters on our fridge that we play word games with, nothing formal, just messing around stuff.  When I realized that Chamille learned words when she saw them and connected what the word was, I started putting labels on all kinds of things all over the house just for fun.  We printed out all kinds of neat sayings too, to hang up on walls, and that was mostly her doing from finding things online that were silly or interesting.  Margaux has also really enjoyed board games like clue where you need to at least recognize a bit of the<br/>\n written words to get it, well, unless of course you have a child with really excellent memory.  Chamille used to win Clue all the time before she could read and she never marked anything down on her paper, she just kept a log of it in her head as she found clues.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s 12, does he do online chats or gaming chats?  Does he have a cell phone to text with?  Those are really great ways to learn how to communicate with written word, even with shortcuts.  If not, what DOES he like and perhaps others can show you how reading is and can be a part of that?<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":278937908,"authorName":"LauraM","from":"&quot;LauraM&quot; &lt;la_tree@...&gt;","profile":"mcclan113","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"reading : how long to wait?","postDate":"1269320778","msgId":52269,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhvOWk4YSt2azd0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":52270,"prevInTime":52268,"nextInTime":52270,"topicId":52269,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m looking for some insight and advice here please on the subject of Reading, with regard to the concept of reading in their own time .
