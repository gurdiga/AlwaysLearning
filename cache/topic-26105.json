Reading is just one thing of a gazillion that they<br/>\ncould love, and indeed they do love many different things.----<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAbout a year or two ago I came to terms with the fact that my kids may never<br/>\nenjoy reading the way I do.  And I am really ok with that. (and my older dd<br/>\nhas never uttered those words although she reads a lot, mostly magazines and<br/>\nnon-fiction) However, I get so much pleasure and information from reading<br/>\nthat I still have always hoped that they would one day find it an enjoyable<br/>\nthing to do too.  Hearing my dd utter the words, &quot;I love reading&quot; really<br/>\ndoes make me happy.  I am happy that she has found one more thing that she<br/>\nenjoys.  I hope that she gets as much enjoyment out of reading as I have<br/>\nover the years.  I enjoy fiction and non-fiction.  I enjoy the internet,<br/>\nemail, and these lists.  Reading has really broadened my horizons and I hope<br/>\nthat it does the same for my children. It makes me happy to see that they<br/>\nare happy learners.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nFunny story:  My younger dd has been going with a public schooled friend to<br/>\na teacher&#39;s house after school for tutoring once a week.  (the friend gets<br/>\ntutored and Lilly just goes along)  The teacher just so happens to be my<br/>\nhusband&#39;s aunt who, when she heard we were going to homeschool 6 years ago<br/>\nsaid, &quot;I am very sorry for your children.&quot;  Ack!  Anyway, somehow or another<br/>\nLilly got invited once because the teacher and the friend were at the barn<br/>\ntogether where both girls take lessons and the friend asked if she could<br/>\ncome along.  Ever since that one time, Lilly has been invited to come every<br/>\nweek because the friend not only acts better when Lilly is there, but she<br/>\nalso cooperates better for her lessons.  The teacher often makes a game of<br/>\nthe lessons and Lilly happily plays along.  The teacher has commented<br/>\nseveral times to my husband that Lilly is such a pleasure to have around and<br/>\nsuch a nice kid.  I don&#39;t place a lot of value on her opinion for a couple<br/>\nreasons, but it made me chuckle to hear it.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] I need some input about spelling","postDate":"1150921645","msgId":26157,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhEMUExNjA2LTg5NTgtNDUxNi04MEYwLThFQUM0RDJGQzI1NUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHQ0VOTURIQUIuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHQ0VOTURIQUIuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":26156,"nextInTopic":26159,"prevInTime":26156,"nextInTime":26158,"topicId":26105,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- Hearing the words, I love to read makes me happy.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-792550462\">-=-&gt;&gt;Hearing the words, &quot;I love to read&quot; makes me happy.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I just wanted to add to this that I have not ever heard those  <br/>\nwords from my<br/>\nkids, but it&#39;s okay-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday Holly said that now she feels like she would be able to  <br/>\nhandle anything she might ever need to read.  I told her I didn&#39;t  <br/>\nknow she&#39;d been worried about it.  She said she was a little worried  <br/>\nabout driver&#39;s ed (which she intends to take in November), but she&#39;s  <br/>\nnot worried anymore.   I guess she had picked up some kids&#39; books and  <br/>\njust flown through them.  She&#39;s read several &quot;young adult novels&quot; and  <br/>\nreads on the internet quite a bit.    Oh, I asked &quot;even cursive?&quot; and  <br/>\nshe said no, not cursive.   The other day there was something or other <br/>\n�a letter from ten years ago or so�and I read it and summarized what  <br/>\nwas in it as I was reading.  When it was clear to her that I was  <br/>\nreading something from the closing paragraph, she said &quot;You can read  <br/>\ncursive as fast as you can read print?&quot;   I said yes, if it was  <br/>\nfairly clear or I knew the person&#39;s handwriting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing Holly can&#39;t do, at 14, besides read cursive fluently is  <br/>\nto scan.  She can&#39;t scan a list or directory or menu.   She doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nknow yet how to ignore the words she doesn&#39;t want to read.  She&#39;s  <br/>\nasked me sometimes how it is that I can find things on a menu, so I  <br/>\nshowed her what I skip.  Drinks, beef, seafood�I&#39;m headed for chicken  <br/>\nor combinations or specials.   When I had kids, I looked at the kids&#39;  <br/>\nmenu first.     Somehow Kirby and Marty had no problem with that, and  <br/>\njust as I was typing this I think I&#39;ve realized why.  Most of their  <br/>\nreading started off being gaming manuals and little rules booklets  <br/>\nfor card games and complicated board games.  They skimmed before they  <br/>\nreally read, probably.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":116488337,"authorName":"Gold Standard","from":"&quot;Gold Standard&quot; &lt;jacki@...&gt;","profile":"jackiknouse","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] I need some input about spelling","postDate":"1150920190","msgId":26152,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHQ0VOTURIQUIuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMDYwMWM2OTU1OCRhYzBlZjU4MCQ2NTAwYThjMEBlYm9ueT4="},"prevInTopic":26151,"nextInTopic":26154,"prevInTime":26151,"nextInTime":26153,"topicId":26105,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I felt like I could finally contribute to help someone else.<br/>\nUnfortunately, I sat down to write it as my sink was filling with water to<br/>\nwash the dishes because my dishwasher wasn&#39;t working right.  I forgot about<br/>\nthe running water until my kids came in from swimming and told me it was all<br/>\nover the kitchen.  &lt;sigh&gt; It had run down into my dh&#39;s office below,<br/>\nwrecking books and computer parts, etc.  Sometimes I feel like I am getting<br/>\nmy come-uppance because I used to complain, in my younger days, about other<br/>\npeople&#39;s inability to multi-task.  Seems it gets harder all the time for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, after all the clean up, I came back to the computer only to find that an<br/>\nerror had occurred in Firefox and it shut down without my having saved the<br/>\npost, which was written on the yahoo site not in my email program. &lt;bigger<br/>\nsigh&gt;  Since that day I&#39;ve been quite busy and haven&#39;t managed to sit back<br/>\ndown and get my thoughts written out.  (We went to Pony Club Dressage Rally<br/>\non Saturday and the girls&#39; team took 5th place, which was AWESOME!  We were<br/>\ngone from 5:15 a.m. till 8:15 p.m. though, very long day)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice was to please take dictation for the youngster who wanted his mom<br/>\nto write his story down.  My youngest dd&#39;s (9) inspiration for learning to<br/>\nwrite came from her desire to communicate with pen pals and to get her<br/>\nstories down.  She began having pen pals at 4.5 years old (older cousins and<br/>\ntheir friends) and I had to point to each letter for her to copy so she<br/>\ncould write to them.  She loved it and that was her first interest in the<br/>\nwritten word.  Sometimes when her arm or hand got tired, I&#39;d write for her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nShortly after that, she began story telling stories and I would take<br/>\ndictation for her for hours.  After about a three hour stint I would need a<br/>\nbreak and she would be frustrated because she still had a story to tell.<br/>\n(We have MANY on our computer and they are such a treasure!)  We solved the<br/>\nproblem by getting her a tape recorder and then I could type them at my<br/>\nleisure.  But just having the tape recorder to tape them also made her feel<br/>\nempowered to not have to wait on me to do the typing.  Sometimes we never<br/>\ngot them typed out but she felt good about telling her stories.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat always amazed me was that I often couldn&#39;t imagine how she was going to<br/>\ntie all the different chapters together in the end because they all seemed<br/>\ntoo disconnected, but she always pulled it off.  I found it amazing.  I have<br/>\na much more linear way of thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I never turned it into a lesson, yet she learned to spell and<br/>\npunctuate very well regardless of that.  It really all started to come<br/>\ntogether when she got her own email address and began writing to friends.<br/>\nShe now has several pen pals that she got through Young Rider (common<br/>\ninterest of horses) that she writes to by email and snail mail. She also has<br/>\none email horse-friend that she met on neopets that she writes to almost<br/>\ndaily.  This girl is 14 yo but she also loves to ride dressage, which is<br/>\nLilly&#39;s riding style of choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes Lilly doesn&#39;t choose to bother to punctuate all her emails<br/>\ncorrectly, but I know she knows how to.  She learned it by watching me<br/>\npunctuate her stories and letters when she was done writing them.  She often<br/>\nnow types her own stories and she&#39;s quick on the keyboard although she still<br/>\nhunts and pecks.  I just happened to write something on one of the white<br/>\nboards in the barn the other day and just out of curiosity, I asked the<br/>\ngirls if they could punctuate it and they both did it correctly.  (9 yo<br/>\nmissed a comma, I think)  The sentence was:  Sugar says, &quot;don&#39;t forget to<br/>\nfly spray and sunblock me.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI still find it so encouraging to see that as the kids see a need for<br/>\nsomething, they are quick to learn it, whether or not it is an easy thing to<br/>\ndo.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI was also going to comment on the summer library programs to get kids<br/>\nreading.  I was going to say that my kids signed up one year when they were<br/>\nmaybe 5 and 7 and they were so disappointed by the prizes.  We just wrote<br/>\ndown the books that we read anyway and that was enough (I could read to them<br/>\nat that age) to qualified for the cheesey prizes they gave out.  They gave<br/>\nthe kids plastic trolls.  They never wanted to do it again.that is till<br/>\nyesterday.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe were at Barnes and Noble and when we checked out (bought some new<br/>\nmadlibs, which my kids love) they asked if we were in the summer reading<br/>\nprogram.  They sent us home with the forms which I thought we&#39;d throw away,<br/>\nbut alas, dd (9) was interested when she learned that you can get a free<br/>\nbook.  You have to read 8 books, then you get a free book. (and you don&#39;t<br/>\nhave to buy them there)  As she sat in the chair at home later on reading a<br/>\nbook so she could mark it down, she looked up and commented, &quot;If they have<br/>\nthis program to bribe children to read, why do they give them a free book as<br/>\na prize?  I would think the kids who need to be bribed to read wouldn&#39;t want<br/>\nanother book that their parents will probably make them read.&quot;  LOL!  I<br/>\nthought that was very insightful.  She went on to say that they should give<br/>\naway money or something that kids who don&#39;t like to read would like.  She<br/>\nwent on to say that she likes to read and couldn&#39;t wait to get a free book.<br/>\nThat said, she&#39;s only read a handful of books in her young life so far.  She<br/>\ndoes read constantly while playing games, emailing, playing online games,<br/>\nreading short non-fiction snippets, etc.  The books she usually chooses are<br/>\nnot easy reader books, but pretty long chapter books.  She did however, look<br/>\nat the length of the books that she would be reading in order to get the<br/>\nfree book and she chose based on books that not only interested her, but<br/>\nweren&#39;t TOO long so that she could finish 8 of them before summer is over.<br/>\n(She picked a Junie B. Jones book for the program but she is also reading a<br/>\nPhantom Stallion book on the side that is much longer and more difficult to<br/>\nread.)  She read one Junie B. Jones book in one sitting last night.  I am so<br/>\nglad that I didn&#39;t push reading and that I&#39;ve let the girls come to it in<br/>\ntheir own time and way.  Hearing the words, &quot;I love to read&quot; makes me happy.<br/>\nThat was my goal for my kids with regard to reading.  I just wanted them to<br/>\nlike it.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210653085,"authorName":"Kim H","from":"&quot;Kim H&quot; &lt;kimlewismark@...&gt;","profile":"kimhoussenloge","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Posts with small text","postDate":"1150535146","msgId":26141,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNDgwMWM2OTFlZCQzOGFmNTg1MCRlNjc0NjkzYUBraW04Y2U4YWYzNTQzZT4=","referencesHeader":"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"},"prevInTopic":26140,"nextInTopic":26151,"prevInTime":26140,"nextInTime":26142,"topicId":26105,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Everything s coming out OkKnow - no small print today!

I knew he knew how to read but \nhe would just freeze up if for a second he thought he was reading it \nwrong.&nbsp; He is perfectionist. &nbsp;I remember at about 2 1/2 we were \nlooking at a gerbil but I mistakenly called it a hamster he corrected me and \nsaid gerbil. I asked how he knew he pointed to the sign. So I pushed for him to \nread out loud and read books to me, thinking obviously he was ready. The next \nfew years were really bad.&nbsp;&nbsp;He&nbsp; shut down and refused to read \nanything and wouldn&#39;t even let us read to him.&nbsp;So I didn&#39;t want to repeat \nthat mistake. We&#39;ve just started coming back from that&nbsp;place.&nbsp;&nbsp;He \nuses google and we have many computer programs, I love to spelling, &nbsp;Disney \nlearning read, &nbsp;Jump starts, DK&nbsp; dictionary,&nbsp;typing tutor and so \nmuch more. I just got him a new Scooby Doo computer program he finished it in \nless then&nbsp;2 hours the entire game.&nbsp;&nbsp; He&#39;s known how to read music \nfrom age 2 but every time he sees a new song he just freaks out saying he can&#39;t \nread it.&nbsp; Really he did refuse to do read anything.&nbsp;Now that he is \nfinally asking about spelling I am&nbsp;happily spelling for him&nbsp;without \nany pressure. We use the spell checker to get the spelling.&nbsp;He&#39;s just now \nfinding it&#39;s something that he wants to do rather then what I had wanted him to \ndo. So if I start to show him something like how to use the dictionary it better \nbe a quick&nbsp; lesson or I loose his interest, &nbsp;if it&#39;s not easy for him \nhe freezes.&nbsp;&nbsp;And I&#39;m sure he&#39;s still nervous I&#39;m going to make him sit \nand do formal studies again. It&#39;s only been a 1 1/2&nbsp; years since&nbsp;we&#39;ve \ngone back to unschooling. &nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>It&#39;s very easy to step back into a more formal <u>teaching</u> and \nI&nbsp;knew we couldn&#39;t go there again. I knew he needed to write this story. \nHe&#39;s been trying for some time. &nbsp;I just couldn&#39;t get past that he had to do \nit by himself. Now that I think about it that just crazy thinking on my \npart.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>We do a lot of back door type reading, listening to stories on CD&#39;s TV and \nvideo games. He has great comprehension and a great imagination he act out \nmovies with his action figures ,has long dialogs and voices for each charter. It \nwas just hard for me to think of a back door type writing and spelling skills to \nhelp him to the next step. I was making it more difficult then need be. </div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>As soon as I posted this morning&nbsp; I went with my instincts and&nbsp;we \nbegan the story. He dictated it to me and he&#39;s so excited. He wanted to act it \nout as he tells me the story. We&#39;re going to add his drawings to the \nstory&nbsp;then take it to staples where they will bind it in a book. He&#39;s so \nexcited.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>His dream is to either be actor or co writer with Stan Lee on his next \nfilm. He wrote a letter to Stan Lee a few weeks ago. &nbsp; I did try to get him \nto write&nbsp;in&nbsp;a journal and he dabbled with it drawing pictures but was \nfrustrated because he wanted to write a story and he wasn&#39;t confident about his \ndrawings.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think making his&nbsp;own book will inspire him to do \nmore which is what I want for him to be self-confident.

Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[from Pam Sorooshian to elsewhere some weeks ago, about spelling:]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI just sent this post to my state group (apologies to those who are<br/>\non both). I think it might be useful for those people who have kids<br/>\nwho are reading later than they might feel comfortable with - but, if<br/>\nyou read down farther, there is also a part about my 15 yo daughter<br/>\nand her spelling journey.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have three daughters - the first read at four and a half years old<br/>\nand LOVED to read, play word games, started writing her own stories<br/>\nat five, etc. She still writes and even runs writing workshops and<br/>\npoetry marathons at camps and where she works, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second learned to read all on her own at three years old - spent<br/>\na few weeks driving her older sister crazy by constantly asking her,<br/>\n&#39;What&#39;s this word? What&#39;s this word?&quot; and then she had it figured<br/>\nout. &quot;I&quot; didn&#39;t even know she could read - I wasn&#39;t expecting it,<br/>\nwasn&#39;t looking for it, and it apparently happened so fast that I<br/>\nmissed it. My neighbor is the one who told me - she brought Roxana<br/>\nback from playing at her house and said, &quot;I can&#39;t believe she reads<br/>\nlike that.&quot; I said, &quot;Hmmm, like what?&quot; She said, &quot;Well, she was<br/>\nreading to the other kids.&quot; I had NO idea. So later I gave her some<br/>\nbooks, ones we&#39;d never read together, and she read them. She&#39;s still<br/>\nvery very into words - at 18 she loves literature, linguistics,<br/>\netymology, theater, and anything else that has to do with words and<br/>\nwriting and will probably major in literature, in college. It is her<br/>\npassion.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy third child didn&#39;t learn to read until she was well into being<br/>\neight years old. She has a very very different learning style than<br/>\nthe other two and her focus was on other things. She&#39;s very physical<br/>\n- loves sports (has been on a swim team, played soccer since she was<br/>\nfour, rides horses, and now is very into karate - and she&#39;s always<br/>\nloved puzzles and games - especially strategy games and playing cards<br/>\n(including figuring odds) and role-playing games. As the years went<br/>\nby, she loved to listen to books and, as she got older, she got a<br/>\nlittle frustrated that she couldn&#39;t read. I reminded her that<br/>\neverybody is different and that she was learning all kinds of other<br/>\nthings and that reading would come, not to worry. I gave her some<br/>\nhelp - we played a lot of word games, especially while driving in the<br/>\ncar, but, to be honest, she really wasn&#39;t &quot;getting&quot; the idea of<br/>\nphonics and too much trying to play games based on phonics just got<br/>\nher extremely frustrated and we&#39;d back off immediately. Slowly,<br/>\nhowever, she built up a set of memorized words that she could easily<br/>\nrecognize. And she started trying to read words by guessing based on<br/>\nthe first letter and, a bit later, based on first and last letters.<br/>\nWe joined a theater group and she played the little Indian boy in &quot;A<br/>\nMidsummer Night&#39;s Dream.&quot; She carried the script with her all<br/>\nthroughout the early rehearsals, just like everyone else, but &quot;I&quot;<br/>\nknew she couldn&#39;t really read it. Night after night, she &quot;pretended&quot;<br/>\nto be following the script. Then, one day, I walked in the front door<br/>\nof our house and there she was, upside down, head on the floor, legs<br/>\nup over the back of the couch &lt;G&gt;, reading out loud from the<br/>\nMidsummer script, with GREAT expression, and reading ALL the parts,<br/>\nnot just her own. I thought - &quot;WOW - she&#39;s got quite a memory!!&quot; But<br/>\nI had been fooled again - she was really reading (with a lot of help<br/>\nfrom her memory of the show, of course). Somehow those weeks of<br/>\n&quot;pretending&quot; to follow along in the script had allowed her to break<br/>\nthe code - she &quot;got&quot; the idea and she could suddenly read. That<br/>\nability transferred over to all reading material. That was it - she<br/>\nread everything she could get her hands on. There were LOTS of words<br/>\nshe couldn&#39;t read, at first, because she didn&#39;t recognize them and<br/>\nstill wasn&#39;t &quot;sounding out&quot; well. But her reading improved super fast<br/>\nand within a few months she was reading as well as my other kids had<br/>\nbeen at eight years old - which was VERY advanced for their age -<br/>\nhigh school, college level - as well as most adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, there is more - she STILL couldn&#39;t write anything that others<br/>\ncould understand because her spelling was SO poor. She couldn&#39;t<br/>\nconsistently spell common three-letter words correctly. She usually<br/>\ngot the right letters in the word, but added letters and mixed up the<br/>\norder in odd ways. She spelled the word, &quot;dear,&quot; as &quot;derar,&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;drenar,&quot; for example. Very far off - unreadable. And she had a habit<br/>\nof sticking the letter &quot;n&quot; into words, seemingly randomly. Her<br/>\nspelling problems continued for years - she was 13 years old and<br/>\nstill having trouble writing well enough for others to understand.<br/>\nShe wanted to do better, but I knew from my research that regular<br/>\nspelling lessons were not likely to be helpful. I read a book called,<br/>\n&quot;My Kid Can&#39;t Spell: Understanding and Assisting Your Child&#39;s<br/>\nLiteracy Development,&quot; by Richard Gentry. In that book, he talked<br/>\nabout a spelling disorder as a very distinct and separate thing from<br/>\nother learning disorders, and he gave a lot of ways to cope with it<br/>\nand to help a child or adult who really just can&#39;t spell. So, rather<br/>\nthan focus on her inability to spell and rather than banging our<br/>\nheads against the wall with spelling lessons, etc.,  I helped my<br/>\ndaughter learn some of those coping skills. She liked that because it<br/>\nhelped her function better, immediately. Then she got AIM and started<br/>\ntalking, online, to friends. Her spelling was still so bad people<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t understand her, but one of her &quot;coping skills,&quot; was to just<br/>\ntry again with a different possible spelling. Turned out that if she<br/>\nwrote a word a whole bunch of different possible ways, she could<br/>\nusually recognize the correct spelling when she saw it, even though<br/>\nshe couldn&#39;t just write it down correctly, the first time. So, if<br/>\nsomeone didn&#39;t understand her, she&#39;d just try again with a bit<br/>\ndifferent spelling. AND, she started to write stories - fan fiction -<br/>\nonline, too. For those she used spell checkers (which, as we all<br/>\nknow, only help so much), but, again, it was interesting that she<br/>\ncould nearly always pick the correct spelling out of the suggestions<br/>\nmade by the spell checker. Very slowly, her spelling was clearly<br/>\nimproving. She signed up for NANOWRIMO (National Novel Writing Month)<br/>\nand wrote a 50,000 word novel in 30 days. Spelling wasn&#39;t great but<br/>\nnot NEARLY as bad as I&#39;d thought it would be. She continued to write<br/>\nand chat with friends, online, and to read a lot. She did NANOWRIMO<br/>\nagain the next year. And after it was done, she went back and edited<br/>\nit and painstakingly checked spelling until every word was correct<br/>\nand Lulu press, a self-publishing company, published one copy of each<br/>\nbook completed by NANOWRIMO writers. So she got a lovely bound<br/>\npublished copy of her book. That was last November. She&#39;s 15. In the<br/>\nmonths since then, she&#39;s become an outstanding speller - she spells<br/>\neasily, now. She still asks, once in a while, to make sure she&#39;s<br/>\nright, but she nearly always IS right. Last night she wasn&#39;t sure if<br/>\nit should be &quot;resistance&quot; or &quot;resistence&quot; - but as soon as she asked<br/>\nout loud she said, &quot;Oh, never mind, I know now.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI am SO glad that I didn&#39;t push her or insist on reading or spelling<br/>\nlessons. I truly do not believe it would have helped her, I think it<br/>\nwould have created a power struggle between us and the main lessons<br/>\nshe would have learned would have been, &quot;Learning is hard,&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m<br/>\nnot smart.&quot; Instead, I repeatedly pointed out the ways she WAS smart,<br/>\nsupported her in doing the things she was good at, the things she<br/>\nloved, and put a high value on those things. I reassured her over and<br/>\nover again, that reading would happen for her and I pointed out to<br/>\nher how different people were different in so many ways. It helped<br/>\nTREMENDOUSLY to have other families around who were also relaxed and<br/>\ncomfortable about later reading and who had kids who were later<br/>\nreaders. My daughter did read at 8, with isn&#39;t all that &quot;late&quot; - but<br/>\nit was when she was showing no signs of learning to read at 5, 6, and<br/>\n7, that things might have gone very differently, if I hadn&#39;t made the<br/>\ndecision to accept later reading as natural and normal &quot;for her.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOther kids I know well were still not reading at 8, 9, 10, 11, and<br/>\neven 12 or 13. They now read, read very very well, love books, love<br/>\nlearning. As older teens, they are well-educated, well-informed, and<br/>\nwell-read kids. If you want to hear more about later readers and how<br/>\nwonderful it can be to support them in developing in their own way,<br/>\ncome to the Live and Learn conference and don&#39;t miss Dan Vilter&#39;s<br/>\ntalk - his son is turning 17 next week, didn&#39;t read until<br/>\nvery much later than the norm - and Dan has a LOT of insight to share<br/>\nwith those who are concerned about their later-reading children.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] I need some input about spelling","postDate":"1150389253","msgId":26110,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk0RjQ2RDM5LUI2MUItNEVBMS1BNDJELTgzNTg0NTIyQUFEMkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGU2cnM5bSt2NmpwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGU2cnM5bSt2NmpwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":26109,"nextInTopic":26111,"prevInTime":26109,"nextInTime":26111,"topicId":26105,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Now my son almost 9 who was totally refusing to read the simplest of stores readers 1,2,3, over the years has jumped to adult reading material.-=- I don t","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1614096188\"><html>-=-<font class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614096188Apple-style-span\" face=\"Georgia\">Now my son almost 9 who was totally refusing to read the simplest of <br></font><font class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614096188Apple-style-span\" face=\"Georgia\"> stores readers 1,2,3, over the years has jumped to adult reading <br></font><font class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614096188Apple-style-span\" face=\"Georgia\"> material.-=-</font><div><font class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614096188Apple-style-span\" face=\"Georgia\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614096188khtml-block-placeholder\"></font></div><div><font class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614096188Apple-style-span\" face=\"Georgia\">I don&#39;t know what &quot;stores readers&quot; are but I balk at and object to your assertion and believe that he was &quot;totally refusing.&quot;</font></div><div><font class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614096188Apple-style-span\" face=\"Georgia\">Probably he had not the slightest ability to read them, and it would&#39;ve helped if you had known or considered that.</font></div><div><font class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614096188Apple-style-span\" face=\"Georgia\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614096188khtml-block-placeholder\"></font></div><div><font class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614096188Apple-style-span\" face=\"Georgia\">He didn&#39;t jump to adult reading material, he learned to read, and is reading (I hope) what interests him.  Only in school does learning to read follow a slow curve over twelve years.  It&#39;s artificial.  Kids learn to read when they learn to read.</font></div><div><font class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614096188Apple-style-span\" face=\"Georgia\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614096188khtml-block-placeholder\"></font></div><div><font class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614096188Apple-style-span\" face=\"Georgia\">Here is a collection of some spelling input from an earlier discussion: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/spelling\">http://sandradodd.com/spelling</a></font></div><div><font class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614096188Apple-style-span\" face=\"Georgia\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614096188khtml-block-placeholder\"></font></div><div><font class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614096188Apple-style-span\" face=\"Georgia\">Pam Sorooshian wrote something that is to be published soon in an online magazine, but it also appeared on another discussion list, Unschooling Basics.</font></div><div><font class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614096188Apple-style-span\" face=\"Georgia\">I&#39;ll send that separately.   </font></div><div><font class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614096188Apple-style-span\" face=\"Georgia\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614096188khtml-block-placeholder\"></font></div><div><font class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614096188Apple-style-span\" face=\"Georgia\">And here&#39;s an argument against making kids look things up:</font></div><div><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/aradicalthought\">http://sandradodd.com/aradicalthought</a><font class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614096188Apple-style-span\" face=\"Georgia\"></font></div><div><font class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614096188Apple-style-span\" face=\"Georgia\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614096188khtml-block-placeholder\"></font></div><div><font class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614096188Apple-style-span\" face=\"Georgia\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614096188khtml-block-placeholder\"></font></div><div><font class=\"ygrps-yiv-1614096188Apple-style-span\" face=\"Georgia\">-=-His use of words <br> and vocabulary are so much higher then is ability or even the kids <br> dictionary.

Spell out whatever words he wants spelled. My kids haven&#39;t had a spelling lesson and they have all learned to spell. Some better than others, but they all spell.&nbsp;&nbsp; My 15 year old son was working on a 4-H project this morning, he has to write a short summery of what he learned with his pet this year. The worst thing I did for this kid was try to&nbsp;show him spelling rules! He is a very orderly, linear type kid and he wants every word to fit into some rule.&nbsp;He wants a few basic rules that will apply to all words. &nbsp;And we all know that the English language has more exceptions to the rules than words that follow the rules.....at least it feels that way to Karl!&nbsp; Spelling is not his strong suit and watching him this morning and seeing his frustration for how words are spelled, a light bulb finally went off! I told him to forget the rules. He has an amazing ability to memorize. I told him to just remember how the words are spelled instead of trying to figure out a pattern and rule for them. He has been trying to spell using a formula. I think if he can switch gears to memorizing instead of using a formula, he&#39;ll soon be a whiz and spelling. I, on the other hand, had all the usual years of spelling lessons and tests and still can&#39;t spell.

Every child feels that way...because really, when you&#39;re asking for help, that&#39;s the most basic tool! and think about regular development....every child goes through that phase, then they reach a point where they don&#39;t need you, or the process takes too long.<div><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1373857644khtml-block-placeholder\"></div><div>I&#39;d say to spell what he wants.

Oh <br/>\nyea that another cool thing, him putting a pencil in his hand. :) <br/>\n<br/>\nHe wants to write a story. He want me or his dad to write the story <br/>\nwhile he tells it to us. Of course the schoolish thinking is creeping <br/>\nback. I want him to use this opportunity to learn how to do it for <br/>\nhim self.   If he was writing a Cat and Hat book there would be no <br/>\nproblem. I got him a really nice kids dictionary and showed him a bit <br/>\nhow to use it not wanting to overwhelm him. But as I suspected any <br/>\nword he wants to spell won&#39;t be in that dictionary. First thing this <br/>\nmorning he wanted to know how to spell unlimited.
