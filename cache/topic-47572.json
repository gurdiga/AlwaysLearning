Until we got it to work and<br/>\nlearned more about it, the did the kids were not interested in it.  Lots of<br/>\npeople buy telescopes, microscopes, or hobby sets but if the parents present<br/>\nit as &quot;work&quot; or boring or something they are tolerating only to enrich the<br/>\nchild or don&#39;t take the trouble to make a bit of a production of it kids<br/>\nwill ignore it.  Again, the telescope worked when we snuggled drinking<br/>\nsomething warm together taking turns looking at a faraway disk with other<br/>\ndisks(Jupiter and moons).  Buying even the most expensive hobby sets and<br/>\nleaving them to be discovered is not the same as buying it and enjoying it<br/>\ntogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nsample low key talk:<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought I it would be fun if we &lt;insert activity&gt;.

If you suggest basketball and they<br/>\ncounter with baseball--play baseball, but always think about their comfort.<br/>\nThirst, hunger, tiredness...or injuries can be discouraging. IE if you are<br/>\nshooting basketballs or playing baseball, think about cool drinks or getting<br/>\nice cream afterward and enjoying the activity rather than pressure to learn<br/>\nrules or get excercise as the goal.  As a parent you anticipate their<br/>\nphysical needs and draw them out, building trust and fun.  Learning is the<br/>\nby-product in all life situations.
