For those who know Joni Mitchell&#39;s music and history well, and  <br/>\nwho are very familiar with Prince and his own musical styles and  <br/>\nabilities, it&#39;s WONDERFUL.  Someone hearing it without knowing either  <br/>\nas a songwriter or as a singer would probably just shrug and be  <br/>\nconfused.  You can get it from iTunes for 99cents.  &quot;A Case of You,&quot;  <br/>\nwritten by Joni Mithcell and performed by Prince, from a Joni  <br/>\nMitchell tribute album which hasn&#39;t gotten very good reviews outside  <br/>\nof this one track and another couple are sometimes mentioned.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[{"url":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/leEsz9ci5XE?wmode=opaque","type":"VIDEO"}]}],"prevTopicId":29270,"nextTopicId":29274}}
