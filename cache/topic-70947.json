She cares about my comfort and discomfort. When we are out and about together, she doesn&#39;t want to do things that would bring negative attention to me. It&#39;s kind of a big deal only because she&#39;s a very stand out sort of person. I like that she thinks about and is considerate of others. She has a quiet sort of respectfulness about her in all the right places in public.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of her friends, although lovely people, aren&#39;t that way at all. They have a selfish loudness about them.
