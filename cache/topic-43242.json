As another resource for  <br/>\nexploring the internet, it&#39;s got good potential:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shmoop.com/\">http://www.shmoop.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMy first thought was how and whether teachers at high schools and  <br/>\nuniversities will try to make it &quot;illegal&quot; or against the rules to use  <br/>\nthe site.   The site creates footnotes for reports.

Will schools  <br/>\nblock internet access to this, or flag it?  It says it&#39;s about &quot;making  <br/>\nthe grade,&quot; and not about learning.  Learning looks easy and  <br/>\ninevitable, though!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on history, I&#39;m going to look and see whether they&#39;re doing the  <br/>\nJr. High curriculum versions (glorify U.S. decisions and simplify  <br/>\nmotives), the high school version (admit when the U.S. screwed up, but  <br/>\nthen justify it all so the unit can end neatly on a Friday) or the  <br/>\ncollege version.
