She describes it this way: &quot;A variant of ribbon braiding produces <br/>\nthe Parallel Braid.  If you keep the hair in two tight columns, and braid the <br/>\nribbon around them (in a figure 8 pattern), you get a very interesting braid. <br/>\nIt is my belief that this was used in some of the Italian hair dressing <br/>\nstyles.  Here is an illustration of how the braid in process will look; I won&#39;t <br/>\ndiagram the process, as it is fairly easy once you have the basic 3-strand braid <br/>\ntechnique. The important point is to keep the ribbon flat and loose. &quot; and <br/>\nshows it with one ribbon.  Nah.  If you do it with two, and weave back and forth, <br/>\nyou have some ribbon to tie it off!  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd she shows starting something by tying it around the hair. That&#39;s how I <br/>\nused to do it in high school, I&#39;d fasten the ribbon into a hair tie, then cover <br/>\nup the hairtie, then braid it in.  But that&#39;s lame and wrong.  They didn&#39;t <br/>\nhave hair ties and they didn&#39;t NEED hairties.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo on the PDF instructions too.  BORING.   <br/>\n<br/>\nNo, friends, we can show you how to braid so much purple yarn into a braid <br/>\nWITHOUT HAIRTIES at either end, that the braid can be thicker at the end than <br/>\nwhere you started.  And for straight hair, an added benefit is when you take the <br/>\nyarn out you have wavy, wavy hair.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe look up hair extensions, or look for Ballet Folklorico costume sites, <br/>\nmaybe.  Sometimes they braid wide red ribbons into the dancers&#39; hair, pass it <br/>\nover the front as Germans did with braids a lot) and tie the ribbons across on <br/>\nthe other side in big matching bows, so girls with short hair and long hair <br/>\ncan seem to have matching hair.<br/>\n<br/>\n I looked and found references, but no photos of that hairstyle and no <br/>\nillustrations.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, though, to play with it, get yarn and cut pieces four times as <br/>\nlong as you think the braid is likely to be.  (I make mine longer than four <br/>\ntimes, but four times will do for starters.)<br/>\n<br/>\nCut lots of them.  Depending how fat the yarn is, but to practice, do twelve <br/>\nfor each braid (if one braid, twelve or twenty).   <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can have a lovely assistant, but I usually drape mine over places where <br/>\nthey won&#39;t get all tangled up with each other, so first I adorn my room with <br/>\nyarn hanging on every doorknob, on the towel bar, on the handlebars of the <br/>\nrowing machine, on clothes hooks...<br/>\n<br/>\nGet the braid started.  Make sure the top hair is smooth because you don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to start this stuff over.   By &quot;started&quot; I mean make your three strands, <br/>\ncross two, and hold it.  Put the middle of one of the pieces of yarn behind what <br/>\nyou&#39;re holding there.  Pull one piece of yarn into the outside strand (about <br/>\nto go in) and put it in, hair and yarn.  The other half of yarn is in your <br/>\nhand now, and comes into the middle with the other side piece.  <br/>\n<br/>\nStop.  Add another piece of yarn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t count.  I just keep putting them in and if one strand seems lacking <br/>\nyarn, I make sure to put the next one where it will go there. If one&#39;s getting <br/>\ntoo full, skip that one next time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPut a hair tie on as usual, trim the yarn, you&#39;re done.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdvanced plan:  <br/>\nUse so much yarn that as you run out of hair, there&#39;s as much &quot;hair&quot; (yarn <br/>\nhair) as ever.<br/>\nWhen you run out of hair, keep going with just yarn.  when you&#39;re done, tie <br/>\nan overhand knot and trim the end into a tail (don&#39;t cut it too short).  OR if <br/>\nyou know how to make tassels, wrap the end tassle-style (you won&#39;t be able to <br/>\nfold it over, but I mean the end-wrap knot that goes on a tassle.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can have those braids long, or wrap them around your head and tie the <br/>\nyarn to itself, or around by your ear when you get to a good stopping place <br/>\n(depends how long it all is whether it just goes over the top, or first under and <br/>\nthen over, or time and a half...)<br/>\n<br/>\nWith that kind of braid, when you&#39;re ready to take it out, cut it off where <br/>\nthe hair ends and throw all that yarn away.  Even with the most expensive yarn, <br/>\nit&#39;s cheaper than the beauty parlor.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Purple hair (was Achievements!)","postDate":"1055868693","msgId":15158,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzOC4yMTQ4ZmY2OS4yYzIwYTExNUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":15150,"nextInTopic":15161,"prevInTime":15157,"nextInTime":15159,"topicId":15129,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/17/03 9:06:28 AM, kbcdlovejo@aol.com writes:  Yeah,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1966152076\">In a message dated 6/17/03 9:06:28 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; You could also have gotten a book on horse braids!
