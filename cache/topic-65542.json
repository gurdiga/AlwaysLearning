And beyond the cost there is also the tremendous time commitment and possible philosophical disagreements. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI do, however, think it would be reasonable to request they attend a free school or democratic school if such a thing exists in your area and you can provide financial support for - maybe with a life insurance policy specifically for such a thing.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIf unschooling/homeschooling is a priority for your kids and your family have you considered asking a close friend who also shares these values? We have good friends who unschool and if anything happened to us one or all of our kids would likely stay with them. It is easier for us because our kids are teens...but I think it is important to talk to your kids about this too. What would they want? Are they capable or willing to express preferences if needed...etc.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nNow, friendships often ebb and flow but you can always change the guardian if need be. We&#39;ve at different times had different family members as potential guardians based on what is happening in the family...situations change just as relationships. Just because an individual or couple may fit as a potential guardian now it by no means you are obligated to keep them as guardian if your feelings/circumstances change. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nKelly\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSent from my BlackBerryï¿½ by Boost Mobile\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n-----Original Message-----\r<br/>\nFrom: Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt;\r<br/>\nSender: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>\r<br/>\nDate: Tue, 14 Feb 2012 12:24:03 \r<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;\r<br/>\nReply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>\r<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] selecting guardians for unschoolers\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n-=- And on top of that how\r<br/>\nto ask a guardian to continue homeschooling, preferably unschooling. -=-\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nUnless you have a BUNCH of money are are offering to support the potential guardian fully (financially), you can&#39;t really ask such a thing.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSandra\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] selecting guardians for unschoolers","postDate":"1329247443","msgId":65553,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0RkQxRkY4LUU0MjctNDdDNi1CNDA4LUNBMjlFQTk3NUJCQ0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJMVTAtU01UUDExODVGQzRBRkFCQ0JDMDhGOEU5QjNBQjA3QzBAcGh4LmdibD4=","referencesHeader":"PEJMVTAtU01UUDExODVGQzRBRkFCQ0JDMDhGOEU5QjNBQjA3QzBAcGh4LmdibD4="},"prevInTopic":65542,"nextInTopic":65556,"prevInTime":65552,"nextInTime":65554,"topicId":65542,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- And on top of that how to ask a guardian to continue homeschooling, preferably unschooling. -=- Unless you have a BUNCH of money are are offering to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-929941732\">-=- And on top of that how<br/>\nto ask a guardian to continue homeschooling, preferably unschooling. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless you have a BUNCH of money are are offering to support the potential guardian fully (financially), you can&#39;t really ask such a thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":44234845,"authorName":"Katie McGervey","from":"Katie McGervey &lt;kmcgervey@...&gt;","profile":"lusikimax","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"selecting guardians for unschoolers","postDate":"1329234865","msgId":65542,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJMVTAtU01UUDExODVGQzRBRkFCQ0JDMDhGOEU5QjNBQjA3QzBAcGh4LmdibD4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":65553,"prevInTime":65541,"nextInTime":65543,"topicId":65542,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi all Â­ I m an unschooling mom to 2  boys (9 and 5) and a reader of this list, but a new poster.

It makes us realize more fully the importance of<br/>\nour unfinished wills and assignment of guardians for our children in the<br/>\ncase that something should happen to both of us.  We have dithered since the<br/>\nbeginning about whom to ask to fill the guardian role.  I&#39;m curious about<br/>\nhow others have done this.  Our considerations include: staying close by<br/>\ngeographically vs going to a godparent far away, staying within our church<br/>\ncommunity vs. moving across town with an aunt (which would almost be like<br/>\nmoving far away geographically as we&#39;re in a metropolitan area and aunt&#39;s<br/>\ncircle doesn&#39;t overlap ours), asking our closest family friends with kids<br/>\nthe same age who are rather overwhelmed with their own kids (might be a<br/>\nbetter choice as the youngest kids approach 10yo).  And on top of that how<br/>\nto ask a guardian to continue homeschooling, preferably unschooling.  We are<br/>\njust starting to get to know other unschoolers in our area and don&#39;t have<br/>\nany likely candidates.  Do you pick unschoolers over other things even if<br/>\nyou&#39;re not crazy about all the other family&#39;s choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t usually spend a lot of time worrying about risks that are this<br/>\nsmall, but this is a biggy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d love to hear your considerations and thought process in this decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, Katie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65448,"nextTopicId":65231}}
