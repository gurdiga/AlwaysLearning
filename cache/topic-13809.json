Oh yes and the one child <br/>\nwho is worried about being fat at the age of 8. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I apologize for my confusion, but while folding laundry the 12:00 news <br/>\njust came on and one of the lead stories is about how bullying and bashing of <br/>\nschooled children is now at anyone&#39;s fingertips. I was barely paying <br/>\nattention until I heard that this internet site has been up for 3 years now <br/>\nand is growing at a tremendous rate and is now in the hundreds of thousands <br/>\nof registered users. Unfortunately, being out of it a bit today, I missed <br/>\nwhat the link was, not because I have any intention on visiting it, but <br/>\nbecause I thought it would be wonderful ammo for the argument against sending <br/>\na child to school for socialization.Just another thing we can add to the list <br/>\nof stuff we don&#39;t want our kids &quot;Exposed&quot; to. I will try to watch the same <br/>\nchannel for their 3:00 edition so as to get the link and post it here and <br/>\nthen all those people who think our kids should be exposed to the social <br/>\nenvironment of school can be given the link and they can search for positives <br/>\nin which they would prefer their grandchildren, nieces, nephews, cousins and <br/>\nchildren of friends not miss out on.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace to all of you.<br/>\nRhonda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13807,"nextTopicId":13789}}
