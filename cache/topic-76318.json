There were a couple of other groups involved and active in those days; one is archives only now, and one reformed with the same name but different people. Always Learning has survived for fourteen years. That&#39;s old, for an online forum! Recent posts are numbered in the 76,221 and such... and we don&#39;t have chit-chat there, so that&#39;s over 70,000 substantial posts, in fourteen years.<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________<br/>\n<br/>\nI should’ve posted this earlier in the day, but the day was busy and out of my control, and I didn’t even see this until bedtime in New Mexico.<br/>\nI had written the post a while back, and scheduled it to launch, here: <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com/2015/11/14th-anniversary-of-always-learning.html\">http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com/2015/11/14th-anniversary-of-always-learning.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe group isn’t as busy as it once was, partly because the websites supporting these ideas are bigger and more accessible, and because of discussions on Facebook, probably. It’s still good, though!  <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you, all who read and who write.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76280,"nextTopicId":76310}}
