(grin) (no, no bias here, why do <br/>\nyou ask?)<br/>\nThe millionaire next door book is a little more grounded and I think you&#39;ll <br/>\nreally enjoy it!  Most libraries carry it I think.

Last night I started &quot;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&quot;.  I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt;finding the principles he is talking about very interesting.

Take it with a grain of salt!<br/>\n&gt; Firstly, they&#39;re badly written.  As someone who loves the written word, <br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s really disturbing when a &#39;bestseller&#39; is written so poorly.<br/>\n&gt; Okay, but that&#39;s really not all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Someone did some research on him and he&#39;s not all he&#39;s cracked up to <br/>\n&gt; be.  It seems that he was talking about owning multiple properties in <br/>\n&gt; Arizona (etc) and someone did a search and found him listed as owner of <br/>\n&gt; only two properties, one of which he sold to buy the second <br/>\n&gt; one.
