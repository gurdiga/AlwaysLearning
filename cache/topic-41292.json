List the <br/>\noutings and activities, and then spend some time talking about how great <br/>\nthese things are, how much she is learning, and perhaps help him see the <br/>\nconnections and interconnectedness of all knowledge (I mean how painting is <br/>\nscience, how cookies are small and large motor skills.) Perhaps ask him what <br/>\nhe thinks she would be doing all day long at school - she is young isn&#39;t <br/>\nshe?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso since he has time on his hands, perhaps he would like to take on some <br/>\nspecial activities with her. My dh and dd spend a lot of time doing special <br/>\nthings together, including an invented board game, and a long term project <br/>\nwhere they are following the construction of a dredge in the nearby harbor <br/>\ncomplete with photo record and dedicated notebooks.
