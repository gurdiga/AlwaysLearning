We&#39;re talking about a spouse who is<br/>\npracticing &quot;I don&#39;t care what&#39;s important to you, do this or else&quot; behavior.<br/>\nNow, there are a couple of resolution paths here. First, we need to look<br/>\nat the husband&#39;s words and actions and try to figure out what his motivation<br/>\nis for them - is it a fundamental disagreement with unschooling, and if so,<br/>\nwhy (concern about develpment, socialization, future &quot;success&quot;, etc.) Can we<br/>\nfind a way to allay those fears with facts?<br/>\n<br/>\nOr is it a disagreement about parenting styles that is leading him to want<br/>\nto gain control of something, that merely reflects itself in the unschooling<br/>\nlifestyle because it&#39;s an easy target (which might suggest family or<br/>\nmarriage counseling.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOr, most troubling, is this a fundamental disrespect issue in which the<br/>\nhusband is attempting to assert his beliefs because he does not value the<br/>\nwife&#39;s beliefs (likely about far more than unschooling, if this is the<br/>\ncase?) This is the one that could potentially lead to a divorce, I suppose -<br/>\ncounseling first to see if it&#39;s reconcilable maybe? But here&#39;s my concern -<br/>\nif a spouse stays in a relationship in which they&#39;re not respected and<br/>\nacquiesces to &quot;do it my way or else&quot; behavior from their partner to &quot;keep<br/>\nthe peace&quot; or &quot;save the children&quot;, do those two goals ever get met? Of<br/>\ncourse not - they merely lead to house in which one partner is dominating,<br/>\none is disrespected and bitter, and the kids are caught in the middle and<br/>\nlearning BOTH of those behavior sets because that&#39;s what&#39;s being modeled for<br/>\nthem. That&#39;s scary - I know, it&#39;s how I grew up and it&#39;s taken me a long<br/>\ntime to get through.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess what I&#39;m saying is that unschooling is a lifestyle choice - and<br/>\nlike any lifestyle choice, it presupposes a household environment of respect<br/>\nand dignity for everyone. I think you have to resolve that stuff first<br/>\nbefore you can consider how to live your lives together. If you have that<br/>\nfoundation, then you have a foundation from which to support and help each<br/>\nother through doubt, uncertainty, and misunderstanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff Sabo<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://freeboysdad.blogspot.com\">http://freeboysdad.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sun, Jun 22, 2008 at 7:18 AM, Ed Wendell &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ewendell@...\">ewendell@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   Don&#39;t assume the kids get to live with mom either - The kids could be<br/>\n&gt; &quot;given&quot; to the dad by the courts and weekend visitation to the mom - I saw<br/>\n&gt; one case of a friend where the dad got the kids and she had to work to pay<br/>\n&gt; child support to the dad!!!!!

About a month ago we watched My Dog Skip, a really cute<br/>\nmovie and man did it get my kids asking questions!  From pet care, to<br/>\nwhat started ww2,who&#39;s hitler, what&#39;s prohibition, what&#39;s a victory<br/>\ngarden, why can&#39;t the black kids play ball with the white kids (what<br/>\nan embarrassing part of history to explain), discussing that it&#39;s the<br/>\nera their grandparents were raised, how much things cost then, which<br/>\nled to an inflation discussion, etc. etc.   <br/>\n<br/>\nNot as fluid as Sandra&#39;s Elvis unit, but you get the gist.  Maybe if<br/>\nyou do something as simple as watching a movie together and then<br/>\nbreaking it down for him in schooly terms?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; While you&#39;re on YouTube, poke around for some other similar things,  <br/>\n&gt; and follow those trails.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My kids LOVE youtube!  They find the coolest and the funniest things<br/>\non there!  Graham thinks family guy is just the best thing since<br/>\nsliced bread and he and the hubby were watching the voice overs for it<br/>\non youtube.  We all ended up watching and LEARNING a lot!

Perhaps he is having unacknowledged mental <br/>\nflashbacks to when he was the age your eldest is now and emotions are <br/>\nbeing brought to the surface. Maybe gently probing where his fears <br/>\nare will be helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is always frustrating when a spouse has the problem but expects <br/>\nyou to implement his or her solution! I feel for you on that. But <br/>\nexperience has shown me that getting caught up in resenting that <br/>\ndynamic only digs you into a deeper emotional hole. <br/>\n<br/>\nBeing the sounding board for my dh&#39;s doubts without judgement (and <br/>\nthat is hard too sometimes!) usually allows him to talk himself out <br/>\nof the doubts. It usually takes him hearing himself speak to realize <br/>\nhow silly he actually sounds, and for him to realize and acknowledge <br/>\nthe fear he is sitting in at that moment.(eg &quot;Will Jayn ever stop <br/>\nbeing so selfish?&quot;). We also talk a lot about our own childhoods. It <br/>\nhas taken many conversations to peel back layers and find hidden <br/>\nresentments below the obvious ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would try working with your dh on coming up with a plan, focussed <br/>\nheavily on your dd&#39;s interests. Maybe you are imagining a lot more <br/>\nthan he is in terms of &quot;structure&quot;. Perhaps clarify exactly what he <br/>\nmeans by &quot;lessons&quot;, and what his mental timetable is. You might find <br/>\nthat you are envisioning 4 hours at the kitchen table, but he is <br/>\nthinking of a worksheet every other day.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I would step up the strewing. <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, you say you have shown him lots of stuff from other <br/>\nunschoolers, and it hasn&#39;t taken. So move on to other educational <br/>\nexperts. Show him some stuff from Montessori and Piaget about child <br/>\ndevelopment, and the research supporting delayed academics. <br/>\n<br/>\nKeep you goal &quot;helping him relax and trust&quot; rather than having your <br/>\ngoal be &quot;holding on to unschooling for dear life&quot;.
