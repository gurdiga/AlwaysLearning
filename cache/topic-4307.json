It&#39;s <br/>\nbeen an intense few days...it&#39;s good to come here and feel connected to <br/>\nsomething outside of my family for a minute! A side distraction can be <br/>\nhelpful sometimes. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe funeral is Saturday and I would really like to share Jan&#39;s poem with my <br/>\nfamily. I had copied it and lost it in the rush to get up here. <br/>\n<br/>\nI tried to e-mail you Lisa, to ask for you to send it again, but I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink the e-mail went through. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m here asking for it again!! Thank you in advance. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd thanks for the kind words Dee. I am a bit overwhelmed with &quot;always <br/>\nlearning&quot; e-mail digests and think I&#39;ll just put it off for another day!! Too <br/>\nmuch to think about right now, everything seems a bit surreal, YK? <br/>\n<br/>\nI keep expecting her to walk up the hall any moment...my mind hasn&#39;t accepted <br/>\nthat I won&#39;t see her again even though I watched her slipping away in the <br/>\nhospital. <br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose it will sink in when I don&#39;t get anything in the mail for my <br/>\nBirthday this year...ugh. <br/>\nMother&#39;s day will never be the same, will it? <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not going to be here much for a bit...but it does my heart good to skim <br/>\nthrough the posts and feel a bit more connected!!! <br/>\n<br/>\nTake care everyone, <br/>\nRen <br/>\n<br/>\nHer address is Â <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a><br/>\nif some of you would like to write to her on the side</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4341,"nextTopicId":4327}}
