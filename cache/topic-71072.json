While it has improved at this point because she is more aware of her body and how she feels after going, we are still working through it. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like all the years of focus, doctors, hospitals, etc have stressed your daughter and at this point you just need to find ways to have her be more relaxed about it. Just because &quot;she knows what will happen&quot; may not make it any easier for her. My daughter knows that she feels better after going as well, but quite often she still tries to avoid as long as she can. We try to make it low key and low stress - we play games on the iPad if she wants my company and other times she just wants the cat with her :) We have come to the agreement that when she really needs to go but is avoiding we pull out her favorite prunes (the Sun Sweet D&#39;noir prunes are actually quite yummy) and that helps, but it wouldn&#39;t help a child who is already severely impacted. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe managed to avoid using Miralax over the years - there were so many other possible things we found that we were able to skip it. Calm Magnesium powder in lemonade or orange juice helps. We chose not to do any fiber powders since she wasn&#39;t able to get enough additional liquid into her system to avoid compounding the issue. We used a kids probiotic that had Xylitol in it, daily, which helped quite a bit. In our case cutting down on dairy helped too. We used fish oils, olive oils, popsicles, lemonades, prune juice, and other foods that were naturally high in liquid or oils. We also found using the liquid pedialax was helpful (when she would allow it) because it was more like a regular enema and not a suppository...if you&#39;re impacted why add something else?(sorry for the image). In Caitlyn&#39;s case, she had some painful poops when she was little and it became a fear issue for her and no matter what we did, she refused to poop and even at one point, drink, because she knew she would have to go on the toilet. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo talk with her about what things might help her. Sandra&#39;s leaning on a truck example comes to mind as a way to not focus directly on the issue, but just talk. You might look at some images of various poops - there is a new app on the iPad for an ebook that brings some humor to the subject. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re familiar with the term mega-colon? Basically the colon can sometimes stretch out after years of withholding and take some time to go back to normal so it affects how easy or difficult it is for the body to recognize signals to go, so she simply may really not recognize when it&#39;s time to go. <br/>\n<br/>\nLaura Z<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;supermomblues&quot; &lt;supermom2jakeandemmy@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n&gt; Herein lies the problem - the ONLY treatment that works for her to relieve and impaction is a laxative suppository.

This led to her witholding bowl movements, which led to constipation, ecnopresis, etc.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like she&#39;s still getting the message that there&#39;s a &quot;problem&quot; in this area.  She has learned to think of going to the bathroom as a problem, something painful that she is stuck in a viscous cycle with.  She is developing a distrustful relationship with her body due to the continued focus on the &quot;problem&quot;.  Try to help her separate going to the bathroom from the negative emotions.  I know it really helped my daughter when I was able to remove my emotions from her health.  In the past when she would &quot;get tight&quot; it would generate a lot of anxiety in me which she was clearly aware of.  Up until about a month or so ago she had gotten into a pattern of getting tight almost every night despite being put back on her preventative inhaler.  Then I decided that whenever she got tight I would get her the breathing treatment with the same amount of emotion I would have if I was getting her a glass of water.  No frustration, sorrow, concern, disappointment, etc.  Just &quot;ok, here you go sweetie&quot;.  We did that for about a month along with other things to make her feel safer and more in control of her environment, etc (we have been unschooling for about 7 months so we&#39;ve made lots of improvements over that time).  There was no obvious change in her symptoms until one day when she discovered the unschoolers minecraft server.  She was so excited & engrossed that she spent the whole day on her laptop and turned it off only when she was so tired that she couldn&#39;t keep her eyes open.  She forgot to get tight that night.  Next day, same thing.  She spent 10 days on that server with breaks only for eating, sleeping, bathroom and petting kitty.  She forgot about the tightness in her chest.  After 10 days she took a break from the server to do other things.  Only then did she think about it and say &quot;Hey Mom - I haven&#39;t gotten tight in a long time!&quot;  We had previously talked about the possibility that her emotions were affecting her asthma but she didn&#39;t think there was any connection prior to that.  I could see all the wheels were turning in her mind but I refrained from saying much or being overly emotional, just saying how happy I was for her.  (I didn&#39;t want to taint her intuitive learning with my biases and beliefs that may or may not be relevant to her experience.)  I do not pretend to know exactly what&#39;s happening inside of her but I really think (hope!) that she is figuring it out.  She&#39;s a pretty bright girl & she&#39;s doing great so I just try to keep supporting her and relax and let the warm feeling of love and relief wash over me.  Help your daughter forget that she hates going to the bathroom.  Help her get to a place where it&#39;s just like eating and sleeping, one of the many things we do to take care of our bodies.  I can&#39;t tell you exactly how to do that but I think knowing that she has choices and then having the freedom to practice those choices without worrying about how mom is feeling about it is a good start.  If my daughter can forget to get tight (which I now understand is how she experiences anxiety) then yours can forget that she hates to go to the bathroom.  Help her feel like she is in control of her body and not a victim of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thought - last year when my daughter was 9 she went through a phase when she wanted to use diapers.  She had potty trained herself quite young (2) with no pressure from me but it seemed like she felt the need to go back and revisit the issue.  She would pee in them and sometimes poop.  She was totally in control of the diapers and her decision when and if to use them.  I didn&#39;t focus a lot of attention on it and after about 6 months she stopped doing it.  I know that there was something she needed to work through.  Maybe because she potty trained so early or maybe one of a million different reasons.  Maybe your daughter needs the freedom to poop outside the box, so to speak!

We had also used suppositories","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-101200967\">My 8 year old son suffered from withholding, resulting in impaction, stomach cramps and pain, and general discomfort for years. We had also used suppositories when I knew it had been a while since a bowel movement and he was in pain, and these did work to a point, but they were still only helping us in the &quot;crisis&quot; moment, and we weren&#39;t finding a way to manage so that he could have regular painless bowel movements.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat finally helped was reading and applying the methods in this book:<br/>\nThe Ins and Outs of Poop: A Guide to Treating Childhood Constipation by Thomas R. Duhamel<br/>\n <br/>\nI absolutely wholeheartedly recommend it. It is written by a psychologist, so it approaches the problem as first a mental one. It looks kind of goofy, with silly illustrations on the cover, but don&#39;t let that put you off. It completely changed our entire experience with poop (and without sounding too dramatic about it, it completely changed our lives).<br/>\n<br/>\nI would recommend getting the book, reading through it yourself and sharing what you learn with your daughter, if she is receptive (my son was very interested to see some of the diagrams, and it definitely helped him to understand what was happening to create the blockage). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe six-step program starts with completely emptying the rectum by using an enema. Although my son was initially reluctant, he finally agreed. It was amazing how much poop came out of him and how easy and painless the enema was. He actually said later that he liked how it helped all the poop move through him. He much preferred it to the suppositories, in fact.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen you begin with a daily dose of Miralax (virtually tasteless powder you can mix in any drink), or a similar laxative. He will explain exactly which type works and why. It&#39;s then a matter of finding the right daily amount for her to be regular. 7 months later, we are still on a small dosage of it per day, but it has been the most amazing helpful thing for my son. He happily takes his daily dose in his morning tea, and if I forget it, he reminds me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was initially reluctant to give a daily dose of a laxative, and I worried he would become reliant on it, but I am so glad I tried it. To counter my fears of what taking a long-term laxative might do to his system (and because it was recommended by our trusted family doctor), we have increased his daily intake of probiotics, and added FOS (Fructooligosaccharide) to his daily supplements to help in overall digestive tract health. We were able to work out a balance so that he very quickly got down to 1 tsp of the Miralax each day (the initial suggested dose is much higher, you will have to experiment to find the right dose), and fairly soon, we are confident we can phase that out and rely on the probiotics and FOS. I tell you this so you can see how things look for us several months out, and hopefully how things will look for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps. <br/>\nRachel<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":547671143,"authorName":"supermomblues","from":"&quot;supermomblues&quot; &lt;supermom2jakeandemmy@...&gt;","profile":"supermomblues","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: My Child Refuses Constipation Treatments","postDate":"1364496031","msgId":71090,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtqMjJxditxN2FvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGtqMWNqZCtlYTQwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71089,"nextInTopic":71091,"prevInTime":71089,"nextInTime":71091,"topicId":71072,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"First off - thank you all for your suggestions!

Your care and thoughtfulness really touches me and makes me really appreciate being a part of this amazing group.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I should have given a little more background -<br/>\n<br/>\nWe potty trained too early for Em - started at 18 months, and she just wasn&#39;t ready, so I pushed. This led to her witholding bowl movements, which led to constipation, ecnopresis, etc. We have been on Miralax (2 years), probiotics (a year) and dietary changes (2 years) and nothing has worked. Her body just doesn&#39;t respond to it. The reason the suppository works is because of the manual stimulation that happens when it goes in (that sounds so gross . . . SORRY!). We didn&#39;t learn until about 6 months ago that she had the &quot;water malabsorbtion&quot; (what her pediatrician calls it) problem. This was after seeing two gastroenterologists that both put her on adult doses of Miralax - neither believed I was actually giving it to her when I told them it wasn&#39;t working. So after test after test and ruling out every disorder I can think of, we (her doctor and I) came to this conclusion and decided to not return to any specialists.

When I drink my morning cup of joe I make sure to be near a bathroom.  Maybe a cup of creamy coffee in the morning would be worth a try?  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter has (& is busily outgrowing) asthma & chronically stuffy sinuses so I completely understand where you are coming from emotionally.  Nothing grabs your attention more than those emergency room visits!  It&#39;s so scary to think &quot;she could DIE!!&quot;.  Then the doctors give you their all knowing, all powerful opinions (which usurps your power and faith in her body&#39;s ability to take care of itself).  Then maybe you&#39;ve tried alternative approaches and been given different ideas.  You care so much and it all becomes fodder for your anxiety.  I would suggest that the fear and anxiety are your biggest enemies.  I would suggest that your biggest problem is worrying and focusing on the things that you don&#39;t want, as opposed to being relaxed and focusing on the things that you do want.  I have FINALLY realized the truth in that for us.  My daughter is 10.  As we&#39;ve gone further into unschooling I made a conscious decision to set down my anxieties and focus on changing her EMOTIONAL environment.  I would have never believed the difference it would make.  On March 18, 9:30 pm she looked up at me from her little bed next to mine and said &quot;Mommy, I&#39;m a nose breather now!&quot;  It was a pretty sweet moment for me.  She has not gotten &quot;tight&quot; in over a month and has easily discarded her preventative (steroid) inhaler.  I am shocked at how easily she just turned the corner and started walking away from theses chronic symptoms.  We have never been able to stop the inhaled steroid before without her symptoms increasing.  What changes did I make that precipitated this?  Well, it certainly isn&#39;t due to increased nutrient density in her diet.  Quite the opposite.  I have finally given up trying to control her diet and given the control to her.  She is choosing all of the things that were previously forbidden or guilt ridden.  She is hilarious as she scours the grocery store shelves for brightly colored treasures to explore.  I decided to let go of my worrying over her food and her health, focusing instead on making her feel happier, safer and more in control of all areas of her life.  Evidently that was what she was needing all along.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a book called &quot;Heal Your Body A-Z, The Mental Causes for Physical Illness and the Way to Overcome Them&quot; by Louise Hay.  She gives good food for thought.  She says the following:<br/>\n<br/>\nAsthma - &quot;Probable Cause&quot;- Smother love. Inability to breathe for oneself. Feeling stifled. Suppressed crying. &quot;New thought Pattern&quot; - It is safe for me to take charge of my own life. I choose to be free.<br/>\n<br/>\nSinus Problems - &quot;Probable Cause&quot;- Irritation with one person, someone close. &quot;New thought Pattern&quot; - I declare peace and harmony indwell me and surround me at all times. All is well.<br/>\n<br/>\nConstipation - &quot;Probable Cause&quot; - Refusing to release old ideas.  Stuck in the past.  Sometimes stinginess.  &quot;New Thought Pattern&quot; - As I release the past, the new and fresh and vital enter.  I allow life to flow through me.<br/>\n<br/>\nGas Pains - &quot;Probable Cause&quot; - Gripping.  Fear.  Undigested ideas.  &quot;New Thought Pattern&quot; - I relax and let life flow through me with ease.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck,<br/>\nCass</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":48652687,"authorName":"Rachel","from":"Rachel &lt;rachk2000@...&gt;","profile":"rachk2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] My Child Refuses Constipation Treatments","postDate":"1364483678","msgId":71079,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY5QjU1NDM1LTRBOTEtNDdDRS1BMDI5LUZCM0MzQ0E0N0VBOUB5YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDI2MTc4RDc0LTI2RUUtNEUwOC1BNkI0LTlGMUIxMTk4NTg4MEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGtqMWNqZCtlYTQwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MjYxNzhENzQtMjZFRS00RTA4LUE2QjQtOUYxQjExOTg1ODgwQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71078,"nextInTopic":71080,"prevInTime":71078,"nextInTime":71080,"topicId":71072,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We use benefiber which is an almost tasteless powder that can be mixed into most drinks or food.
