On the few times I’ve heard him talk about his days to people, while he is deliberately vague he definitely implies he does more ‘study’ than he actually does. &nbsp;That doesn’t mean he thinks he ought to be but that he is trying to deflect the subject. &nbsp;</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-114140095\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-114140095\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-114140095\">I have made an effort to know and connect with other homeschooling/unschooling families, not necessarily for the children to socialise but so that we can see their trajectory in the world and I can get support and ideas. &nbsp;Louis sees one family in particular we are friends with - all four children were home schooled in a loving but casual unstructured sort of way (not really unschooled) - they were mostly dyslexic and not ‘academic’ and they are all now over 16 and doing/have done courses in college that they love. &nbsp;So we can see with our own eyes that the school model is not the only way. One of their boys beat literally hundreds of applicants to work in the local Apple store with NO formal qualifications. That sort of evidence gives Louis full confidence that he can do this stuff too - if he wants to.</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-114140095\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-114140095\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-114140095\">When thinking about your post I realised that Louis tends to round up his schooled friends for a particular <b class=\"ygrps-yiv-114140095\">event</b> - like paintballing for a birthday party - rather than just ‘hanging out’, so they have a common goal and activity and don’t chew the fat over life in much detail, just have a laugh at the time. &nbsp;However there <i class=\"ygrps-yiv-114140095\">are</i> friends who have dropped by the wayside. &nbsp;He is selective and if he was made to feel stupid or uncomfortable I think he would simply not bother with them. &nbsp;Many of his schooled (ex) friends are posting stuff on Facebook that he finds really cliched and lame and he is quite mocking of them - the smoking and ‘rebelling’ they are doing. He sometimes mock complains that he doesn’t know how to rebel - asks me for ‘advice&#39;!!! &nbsp;He rejects the narrowness of their thinking.</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-114140095\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-114140095\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-114140095\">His unschooled friends he mainly met through unschooling gamers (the yahoo group). &nbsp;It took time, persistence and input from me (in the background and mainly unknown to him) to connect him up with like minded folk - but once connected it was and is really affirming for him. &nbsp;I have made friends too - with the parents I was negotiating with - we all feel richer. &nbsp;He has friends in all time zones, for all times of day, and they lead to other friends of friends and so on. &nbsp; It took time and patience but they are there and real. &nbsp;I actually don’t know if all of his online friends are unschoolers but it took off from there and some definitely are. &nbsp;I had to get to know what games he likes etc. I don’t play, (he doesn’t want me to, thank goodness), but he knows I am interested and now he tells me stuff, his gaming news. &nbsp;That online community seems sparkly, creative, witty and fun. &nbsp;It’s easy for Louis to avoid the negativity.</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-114140095\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-114140095\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-114140095\">He also goes to a weekly youth group &nbsp;which is actually quite political, - mostly schooled but all quite thoughtful and switched on. To begin with, Louis felt a bit marginalised because they all knew each other from various schools but as soon as they all went on a camp together he was integrated fully. &nbsp;They weren’t old school friends of his so have always seen him as ‘the homeschooled boy’ and just accepted it. &nbsp;No history, they don’t ask questions, which might be much easier. &nbsp; &nbsp;Again, this took a huge amount of teeing up secretly in the background from me - he was very suspicious of ’groups’ &nbsp;but I saw he could really enjoy this if he was introduced in the right way.</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-114140095\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-114140095\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-114140095\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-114140095\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-114140095\">I suppose in summary, when my son was 14 I spent a lot of time and energy nurturing friendships in the background - setting things up for him to expand his social network but without him realising it overtly. &nbsp;trawling unschooling gamers yahoo groups, talking to leaders of local groups, organising birthday outings, connecting with local homeschooling families &nbsp;(there are few unschoolers here). &nbsp;It was actually REALLY IMPORTANT to move away from his schooled friendship group. &nbsp;They are still there, but to be dipped into, but not relied on for self esteem and validation. &nbsp;Louis and I were not doing much ‘together’, (he went through a phase of not wanting to be seen out with ‘mum’) but i still paid attention and my quiet background role was, i think, vital to expanding his world.&nbsp;</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-114140095\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-114140095\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-114140095\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-114140095\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-114140095\">Be as excited as you can be about the possibilities his/your life holds. &nbsp;So many things to do, so many opportunities when you are not at school. &nbsp;Take a survey of all the adults you know doing cool things totally unconnected to what they did at school (most, you will find!). &nbsp;See life and learning in a big way - don’t focus on the ‘learning outcomes’ of each day (I think a ‘learning diary’ would just make louis and I anxious and annoyed). &nbsp;The jobs that exist now weren’t even thought of when I was at school. &nbsp;(So many cool jobs I wish i’d known about!) &nbsp;The jobs that exist in the future?

See what they’re doing.
