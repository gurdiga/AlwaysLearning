He went<br/>\nfor a few months, and is finishing at the end of this month.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nZak told me the other day that he could do everything at home that he<br/>\nwas doing at school and not have to get up so early and go to bed to<br/>\nearly and have to sit still in the same place at school.  Upon asking<br/>\nhim more about this it seemed to make sense.  Even though this<br/>\nalternative school is wonderful (its like an Unschooling school with<br/>\nother kids), we are paying $640 a month for this pleasure and hes gone<br/>\nfor 6 ½ hours.  Im not sure its harmed him to be there in the past few<br/>\nmonths, I guess Ill find out when I bring him home.  I have noticed<br/>\nthat he and Max fight a lot more (I think because they are not together<br/>\nas much as they used to be).  Zak also likes to have alone time in his<br/>\nbedroom more, he says its because theres so much noise at school.<br/>\nHes had to learn how to deal with a bully and Im not sure if thats a<br/>\ngood thing or not.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nTomorrow hes staying home and we are off to one of our homeschooling<br/>\nmeetings and Im looking forward to that.  I still think that<br/>\ndeschooling ME is the hardest part of this.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nGlad to be back.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n<br/>\nTucson, AZ<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11850,"nextTopicId":11877}}
