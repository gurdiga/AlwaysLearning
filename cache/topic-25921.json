I did put the subject as &quot;June Unschooling Conference&quot; for<br/>\nthe purpose of hoping to raise an extra eyebrow.  And I put it out in a<br/>\ndifferent way to each list I post it too.  However, I wouldn&#39;t claim it to<br/>\nbe a Montessori conference or Waldorf conference.

However your<br/>\ncomment about unschooling not being the same struck a cord with me.  While<br/>\nunschooling is certainly not the same as school reform, it is a very real<br/>\nand valued form alternative education.  Alternative education encompasses<br/>\nalternatives (see the cover of our packet for a visual example of this:<br/>\nwww.edrev.org/packet.html ).  I also think it&#39;s worth making connections as<br/>\nunschoolers to the freedom-based democratic schools.  The similarities in<br/>\nnot only philosophy, but daily approach to education is indecipherable most<br/>\nof the time.  That&#39;s not to say there aren&#39;t differences, as that line of<br/>\nthinking would be naive, but countless commonalities are worth paying<br/>\nattention to and learning from each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\n<br/>\nIsaac<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: June Unschooling Conference","postDate":"1148390155","msgId":25925,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE1Q0QwOEYzLTY3QUEtNEMyRC05OTRDLTcyMDFBNjg1NzI2RUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGMyZDNjNDU4MDYwNTIzMDUxOGw0N2E2NzExN2tjM2ViODg5MmExNTU4NGE2QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGMyZDNjNDU4MDYwNTIzMDUxOGw0N2E2NzExN2tjM2ViODg5MmExNTU4NGE2QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":25924,"nextInTopic":25954,"prevInTime":25924,"nextInTime":25926,"topicId":25921,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The keynote panel discussion very much is on focus as<br/>\nthe discussion will be had between 10 panelists (one of which is<br/>\nrepresenting unschooling, while the 9 others are representing different<br/>\nmodels of education) which will be having an open dialog with the audience<br/>\nabout the commonalities and differences between all the different types of<br/>\nalternatives and what everyone can learn from each other.  Also 2 of<br/>\nour featured keynoter speakers (Gatto and Farenga) are full on unschooling<br/>\nadvocates, while Mintz promotes unschooling quite heavily, but also promotes<br/>\ndemocratic schools, which may carry the stigma of the word school,<br/>\nbut they&#39;re places where unschoolers are getting together under the umbrella<br/>\nof a school (I was one who attended a democratic school and then spent a<br/>\nnumber of years unschooling and I lived my life and directed my own<br/>\neducation in the same way whether I was technically enrolled in the<br/>\ndemocratic school or technically unschooling). Our other keynote speaker<br/>\nSadofsky is speaking on democratic schools as well.  The communities<br/>\nworkshop series is sponsored by a 501(c)(3) decentralist education group<br/>\ncalled the School of Living (not a school, just a name) which is running<br/>\nworkshops on drawing, songwriting, permaculture and fun things of that<br/>\nnature.  Student (which is synonymous with youth for our purposes) Film<br/>\nFestival and Speakers....well that certainly applies...Two of our student<br/>\nessay contest winners who will be speaking are unschoolers in a addition to<br/>\na couple of our panelists, while the film festival will include student made<br/>\nfilms from unschoolers and alternative schoolers alike.  It&#39;s also worth<br/>\nmentioning that our student events coordinator is an unschooler too.  You&#39;re<br/>\nright about the documentaries not applying directly to unschooling (only a<br/>\nfew short ones though).  Also, the &quot;school&quot; starters workshop series is a<br/>\nworkshop series for anyone trying to create any kind of school OR<br/>\nlearning/resource center...the latter def. applies...Overall, I think your<br/>\nstatement is factual in that the content of the majority of our sessions is<br/>\nnot 100% specific to unschooling.  However, I would add that the vast<br/>\nmajority of our sessions are very pertinent to unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy main reason for feeling quite justified in calling this an unschooling<br/>\nconference is because of the way in which it&#39;s run.  I started organizing<br/>\nthe event three years back while unschooling and wanted it to have the same<br/>\nfeel and process as my education.  I felt that the conference should allow<br/>\nas close to as much freedom as I experience in my education as possible.<br/>\nThe workshops are run through open space technology where everyone young and<br/>\nold has the right to host a workshop on whatever topic they want.  They have<br/>\nthe freedom to then run that workshop in the best way that they see fit.<br/>\nBecause of this, I feel the conference lives and breathes unschooling.<br/>\nWhile not every workshop is specifically focused on unschooling, you&#39;d be<br/>\nvery hard pressed to find any that don&#39;t involve unschooling!  You also have<br/>\na minimum of 6 workshops that are held simultaneously, so even if one<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t involve unschooling, you&#39;ve got more than enough that do!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this provides a little background into my reasoning for calling it an<br/>\nunschooling conference.  My point in writing all that I wrote is not to<br/>\ndrive my opinion (which it is and I&#39;m sure others will still disagree) in<br/>\nthe ground, but to provide what I felt was the necessary amount of context<br/>\nto understanding my thinking.  I&#39;d be interested to hear what you think now<br/>\nhaving a little more information on it.   And hey, there&#39;s lots still plenty<br/>\nof pre-conference presentation slots left to schedule, so if you have any<br/>\ninterest in coming out we&#39;d love to have you!  It&#39;s worth noting that we<br/>\ndon&#39;t turn anyone away from the event based solely on financial reasons.  We<br/>\nalways have room to work out scholarships and/or work exchanges for the<br/>\nconference fees.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the best,<br/>\n<br/>\n-Isaac<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message 1<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Sandra Dodd&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a><br/>\n&gt;    Date: Mon May 22, 2006 5:35am(PDT)<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: June Unschooling Conference<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Although I think that an alternative education conference could be a<br/>\n&gt; ton of fun, to call it an &quot;unschooling conference&quot; seems misleading.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Highlights include keynote panel discussions, new school starters<br/>\nworkshop<br/>\nseries, communities workshop series, student film festival & speakers,<br/>\ndocumentaries & films, FREE child care throughout, huge bookstore,<br/>\nmusical<br/>\nperformances, talent show, open workshop space, and plenty of<br/>\nworkshops &<br/>\nevents for all!<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of that has quite another focus than unschooling has.<br/>\nUnschooling would fit in as a small part, but that doesn&#39;t make it<br/>\n&quot;an unschooling conference.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] June Unschooling Conference","postDate":"1148301287","msgId":25922,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVDNzZDRjU4LUU1RjktNDZGQS1CMkRELUYxQTQyOTMzOTRCMkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGMyZDNjNDU4MDYwNTIyMDMwMWczODBmN2UyZm84MDI5ODQwNDZlY2I2ZTZjQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGMyZDNjNDU4MDYwNTIyMDMwMWczODBmN2UyZm84MDI5ODQwNDZlY2I2ZTZjQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":25921,"nextInTopic":25924,"prevInTime":25921,"nextInTime":25923,"topicId":25921,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"[AlwaysLearning] June Unschooling Conference Although I think that an alternative education conference could be a ton of fun, to call it an unschooling","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1474316182\">[AlwaysLearning] June Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough I think that an alternative education conference could be a  <br/>\nton of fun, to call it an &quot;unschooling conference&quot; seems misleading.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Highlights include keynote panel discussions, new school starters  <br/>\nworkshop<br/>\nseries, communities workshop series, student film festival & speakers,<br/>\ndocumentaries & films, FREE child care throughout, huge bookstore,  <br/>\nmusical<br/>\nperformances, talent show, open workshop space, and plenty of  <br/>\nworkshops &<br/>\nevents for all!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Sponsored by The Montessori Foundation, the International Montessori<br/>\nCouncil, Association of Waldorf Schools of North America, Center for  <br/>\nLiberty<br/>\n& Community, School of Living, Institute for Democratic Education,  <br/>\nStudents<br/>\nAgainst Testing, International Association for Learning Alternatives,  <br/>\n& Life<br/>\nLearning Magazine.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of that has quite another focus than unschooling has.   <br/>\nUnschooling would fit in as a small part, but that doesn&#39;t make it  <br/>\n&quot;an unschooling conference.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":243921243,"authorName":"Isaac Graves","from":"&quot;Isaac Graves&quot; &lt;isaacgraves@...&gt;","profile":"nomoretests16","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"June Unschooling Conference","postDate":"1148292116","msgId":25921,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGMyZDNjNDU4MDYwNTIyMDMwMWczODBmN2UyZm84MDI5ODQwNDZlY2I2ZTZjQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":25922,"prevInTime":25920,"nextInTime":25922,"topicId":25921,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"* I saw John Taylor Gatto (author of Dumbing us Down ) there a couple of years ago and that is what inspired me to homeschool. - SE, New York* ** * I learned","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-55749031\">*&quot;I saw John Taylor Gatto (author of &quot;Dumbing us Down&quot;) there a couple of<br/>\nyears ago and that is what inspired me to homeschool.&quot; - SE, New York*<br/>\n**<br/>\n*&quot;I learned a lot about Education but much more about myself.
