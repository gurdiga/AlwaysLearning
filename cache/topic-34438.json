We had a dictionary that had older forms at the  <br/>\ntop of every letter&#39;s beginning.  I&#39;ve done calligraphy for 30 years,  <br/>\nand tried before then to learn it on my own.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never seen a seven with a line at the bottom, ever.<br/>\nI&#39;ve never seen a nine that had more than one small curve at the  <br/>\nbottom.  Usually it ends straight.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo maybe ancient phoenicians did more lines, but I can&#39;t imagine it  <br/>\nwould&#39;ve been efficient to write those numerals with three strokes  <br/>\n(as the 7 pictured there would&#39;ve had) when using the numbers for any  <br/>\npractical purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe somewhere there were ideal forms that had those angles and the  <br/>\nwritten form was a representation of those.  Like the dot patterns  <br/>\nthat make up constellations of stars with their ideal overlays and  <br/>\nstory connections.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on fours, the fact that their line doesn&#39;t cross over the  <br/>\nvertical seems suspicious.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think what I&#39;m asking is that nobody here &quot;teach&quot; children that  <br/>\nnumerals have that many angles.  Maybe say &quot;might have once,&quot; but I  <br/>\nthink that&#39;s as far as truth can go.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other cool number systems to look at.  cuneiform/ <br/>\nBabylonian  (oooh!  wikipedia has a big number chart!)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_numerals\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_numerals</a><br/>\nand  runes, though they vary place to place, are interesting.   <br/>\nSometimes they needed to edges of a 90 degree surface, because they  <br/>\nwere whittlings on split sticks, or carvings on the edge of worked  <br/>\nstones.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at the numbers here, which are akin to Roman on the small ones,  <br/>\nbut really cool on big numbers:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.omniglot.com/writing/hungarian_runes.htm\">http://www.omniglot.com/writing/hungarian_runes.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve known runes as NW European things, and I don&#39;t know how far east  <br/>\nthey went (or from where in the East they  might&#39;ve come).<br/>\n<br/>\nPracticalities of formation will change depending on how the letters  <br/>\nare being formed.  Sticks pressed on wet clay?  Carvings with a  <br/>\nlittle knife?  Chisel on a rock?  (That&#39;s the explanation I&#39;ve heard  <br/>\nmost for Roman numerals:  they needed to be made with a chisel.)  <br/>\nStick on wax?  Pen and ink on parchment?  Ballpoint pen on notebook  <br/>\npaper? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing about numbers, too, is that although we set them all on the  <br/>\nsame line, same height, not long ago (within a couple of hundred  <br/>\nyears) some went below the line (the real or imagined line), and some  <br/>\nwere shorter.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs with lots of history, simplifying it can make it untrue.  Let it  <br/>\nbe complicated!  Kids can grasp and appreciate complication.  It  <br/>\ngives them more mysteries to look out for in their lives.
