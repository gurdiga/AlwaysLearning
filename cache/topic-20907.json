Marty was just watching a review of the new Star Wars DVDs and <br/>\nasking me questions, and I told him a couple of things I had heard.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBefore I came down here, I was sorting through a shelf of music because the <br/>\nshelf collapsed, and we have people coming over to sing tonight.  One thing on <br/>\nthe shelf below that (which I&#39;ve commandeered for the music) is two <br/>\nstring-tied bundles of old New Mexicco Magazines.  One right on the top says &quot;Special <br/>\nTrain Issue.&quot;  I&#39;ve never opened the bundles; a much older friend (now deceased) <br/>\ngave them to me years ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly is in the kitchen playing with some orange/green/weird <br/>\nalien-creature-making pop-together things.  I don&#39;t know the name of them.  We gathered them <br/>\nall up from Marty&#39;s closet when he cleaned it out recently.  The hadn&#39;t been <br/>\nout to be played with for a few years, and now they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby has gone to the shop where he works to get a schedule and to talk about <br/>\na murder game he&#39;s about to run.  He ran one without the book, and now got <br/>\nthe book.  Last night I found him sheet protectors for all the pages, he went to <br/>\nKinko&#39;s where a friend works and got the spine cut off of it, and put all the <br/>\npages in the sheet protectors, in a binder I had.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night Marty and Holly were watching some borrowed &quot;Buffy the Vampire <br/>\nSlayer&quot; episodes.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night Keith (my husband) watched Man on Fire in the bedroom.   It needs <br/>\nto go back to the video store soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the time I wrote this, Family Feud has started. Marty&#39;s watching it while <br/>\neating his breakfast.<br/>\n<br/>\nThursday Marty and I had a reservation for a tour of a civil war battlefield <br/>\n(Glorieta) that&#39;s only shown by riding in the govt. van with a park ranger, <br/>\nbut Marty got a job and it starts Thursday.  He&#39;ll be making boots and pouches <br/>\neventually, but at first just helping clean up, organize, and cut leather I <br/>\nthink.   The place of work is the garage at our old house!

He&#39;s going to help me organize the library, which has <br/>\na lot of his gaming stuff in there these days.   That&#39;s where we&#39;re singing <br/>\ntonight.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a couple of hours, he goes to the dojo to teach a class, to take his <br/>\nclass, and then a weapons session.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat started as a typical moment turned into a day in the life. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20812,"nextTopicId":20910}}
