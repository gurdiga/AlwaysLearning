I am new to this list but not new to unschooling. I <br/>\nhave to admit, (with an embarassed grin) that I have, at various <br/>\ntimes over the years been sucked into periods of using..that bad <br/>\nword..structure imposed by me. Well... some people just take awhile <br/>\nto learn. I have a wonderful husband, who is the opposite of some of <br/>\nthe husbands I&#39;ve heard about on some of the unschooling message <br/>\nboards. Actually, he is the die hard unschooler of the family. He and <br/>\nmy oldest son, who will be 18 on the first day of Spring keep <br/>\nbringing me back to an unschooling mindset. From my present <br/>\nperspective, I appreciate that from them. I&#39;ve tried to use all kinds <br/>\nof &quot;curriculum&quot; on him and he always politely (OK sometimes not so <br/>\npolitely) declined to follow it. Whenever I get on a &quot;structure <br/>\nKick&quot;, my husband says &quot;Why!?!&quot; and we give it up after a few weeks <br/>\nand have to detox and watch westerns or sci-fi movies for a week or <br/>\nso. <br/>\n     I feel like one of those people who get up at an AA meeting and <br/>\nsay &quot;Hello my name is Elissa, I am a Structureholic&quot;. I have known <br/>\nbetter from the beginning, my mom read John Holt!!! She sent us to <br/>\nschool because she thought she would go to jail if she didn&#39;t but <br/>\nencouraged us to participate as little as possible and pursue our own <br/>\ninterests. My sister dropped out ... I guess I get sucked into the <br/>\nthinking of some of my conservative Christian friends and do not want <br/>\nthem to disapprove of me...actually they already do...my son is such <br/>\na non-conformist who has complete freedom...Someone advised me once <br/>\nnot to let him go to camp unless he got caught up on his schoolwork. <br/>\nI thought Yeah...Right! I did not take that advice, needless to say. <br/>\nI have finally realized that I cannot live in both worlds. As I said, <br/>\nit takes some people awhile to grasp simple concepts!!!<br/>\n     Anyway, I am hoping this list will help me to stay committed to <br/>\nwhat I know is right for my family...Unschooling!!! I have a 14 year <br/>\nold daughter who ignores my attempts at structure, a 10 year old son <br/>\nwho is just getting it about reading, a 7 year old son who is also <br/>\njust getting it about reading, a three year old boy and a baby girl. <br/>\nI would really like to get out of my bad habit of &quot;schoolish <br/>\nthinking&quot; and be on the same page with the rest of my family!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n    Have a great day!!<br/>\n              -Elissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13073,"nextTopicId":13082}}
