We were at the library and my 11 yo son came over to me, stating he was going to sign up for the reading program. I asked him why he wanted to and he said they&#39;d give him prices. He does not read much himself (started reading on his own about a year ago), but is an avid recorded book listener. So, he said that if he listened to his Harry Potter book another time (he&#39;s in the middle of the second time on the same book), he&#39;d be done and could collect the prizes....He&#39;s obviously not going to listen to the books for the reward, but if they&#39;re going to give him rewards for what he&#39;s doing, he&#39;s going to take them, I guess.So he signed up. <br/>\nWhen I asked if my 7 yo daughter wanted to win prizes too she said no, thank you!<br/>\n<br/>\nSybelle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22452,"nextTopicId":22509}}
