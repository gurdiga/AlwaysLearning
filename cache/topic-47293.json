The opening page sounds just as the OP described her daughter&#39;s situation. &quot;From six to sixteen almost no one asked you what you wanted to be when you grew up. ...Suddenly you&#39;re supposed to have all the answers. And you don&#39;t, do you?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis book (used) is available for just a few dollars, and offers a wealth of information. Besides talking about why going right into college can be a mistake for some, the book discusses alternative education and entry into the workforce via internship or volunteerism. It also discusses ways to travel internationally for those young adults who may seek this opportunity. I found the book easy to read and was impressed with the breadth of coverage.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also recommend the following websites for exploration. The first one, from the Employment and Training Administration, lists free online resources for job seekers. These include tools to assess one&#39;s interests, as well as career exploration sites. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.doleta.gov/jobseekers/career_options.cfm\">http://www.doleta.gov/jobseekers/career_options.cfm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe second site is affiliated with the Career One Stop centers. It has links that describe many different jobs with their estimated wages, projected growth, necessary skills, potential education and training, etc. You are prompted to enter your state so the database can give you state information on wages and projected openings, as well as national information. The site also has videos that describe jobs (at a very basic level).<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.careeronestop.org/ExploreCareers/ExploreCareers.aspx\">http://www.careeronestop.org/ExploreCareers/ExploreCareers.aspx</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nThe third site is the Bureau of Labor Statistics Career Guide to Industries. This site discusses information from a broader context than the second site, and it includes an interesting section on working conditions that talks about hours and physical environment. It also provides references for national-level organizations in the respective industries.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bls.gov/oco/cg/home.htm\">http://www.bls.gov/oco/cg/home.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLisa</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: jobs for young adults","postDate":"1253326127","msgId":47362,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQxNjkxQjVELUQ2NzktNDlBMC04MkNGLTI1QjY0QzFERDk4REBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGg4dTZuOCtrb3E3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGg4dTZuOCtrb3E3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47359,"nextInTopic":47365,"prevInTime":47361,"nextInTime":47363,"topicId":47293,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-.

Kids in college will often change majors midway through because they decide that they aren&#39;t really interested in that after all.  That&#39;s a pretty expensive change of mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nChamille has been doing make-up and hair and clothing things for a couple of years now.  Just on her own time and terms.  She&#39;s cut several people&#39;s hair, she&#39;s become very good at dying hair, and she decorates people, herself and others using make-up.  She redesigns clothing and makes accessories.  She takes great pictures, which is good, since she&#39;ll be able to put them into a portfolio if she needs to.  All these things are, to her, just something she does.  She&#39;s becoming aware of the fact that she&#39;s getting good at it and that others are seeking her abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did a haunted house thing last year and had a wonderful experience working with costumes and special effects and scaring people.  We are doing it again this year.  We started doing it because she likes horror movies and Halloween and fake blood.  They seemed like trivial interests to lots of people we knew. <br/>\n<br/>\n She was offered an intern position to learn make-up with a local special effects company that does both the pretty and the scary, for all kinds of sets.  She&#39;ll be able to get official training from this.  This just happened over this last weekend while we were volunteering at the haunted house.  The person offering, was in charge of all the make-up last year and is doing prosthetics for one of the haunts this year.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe point, besides sharing this awesome bit of news, is to say that none of that was the intent.  She wasn&#39;t doing the haunted house or make-up or anything like it to get official training or to seek that out.  She was doing it simply because it was something she liked doing.  She may change her mind, or she may continue with this passion that has slowly evolved and gotten more intense in the last year.  It all started with one small narrow interest that expanded to a multitude of other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought at one point how great it would be for Chamille to do some odd jobs to earn money because her passion can get expensive.  She&#39;s been offered babysitting jobs, but she turns them down mostly.  She&#39;s looked into doing other jobs, but has declined to follow through because she wasn&#39;t interested in the time commitment.  It&#39;s a good thing she isn&#39;t working right now, because she needs to have free time to do an internship.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Basically I suggested she doesn&#39;t need to find a career to fill the gap of not going to college and that maybe she&#39;ll find something she wants to do later.

Perhaps she wants to stay in the restaurant industry, and why not?  It could provide a lot of opportunities for travel and one day owning or managing a restaurant.  At the very least it provides her with an income that she can use to do other things that interest her.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":255816758,"authorName":"Mel","from":"&quot;Mel&quot; &lt;beensclan@...&gt;","profile":"beensclan","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: jobs for young adults","postDate":"1253229358","msgId":47327,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGg4dWZ2ZStubGhwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDExOTlBMTRDLTE4NzMtNDBBNS1CREU2LTQ4NjUzQzhCNTAxQkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":47326,"nextInTopic":47330,"prevInTime":47326,"nextInTime":47328,"topicId":47293,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Frito-Lay is owned by Pepsi.  I&#39;m not sure how Coca-cola is set up but speaking from personal experience, Bill started doing picking.  He showed an eagerness to get on the trucks, so Frito-lay set him up as the back-up driver for when everyone else takes vacations.  Eventually, if he is willing to stick it out, he could become a permanent driver. In the meantime Bill works between the distribution centre and the trucks (free chips for us!).

I know one of Claire&#39;s friends keeps asking her what she is going to do with her life since she isn&#39;t in school and isn&#39;t going into college in the fall. Claire says she gives short answers but feels like this friend wouldn&#39;t listen even if Claire did try to explain. She finds herself just repeating &#39;I don&#39;t know&#39; which just seems to invite this other girl to push her.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":337544642,"authorName":"carnationsgalore","from":"&quot;carnationsgalore&quot; &lt;addled.homemaker@...&gt;","profile":"carnationsgalore","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: jobs for young adults","postDate":"1253219880","msgId":47359,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGg4dTZuOCtrb3E3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEIwOTAzRUM5LThGNTgtNENEQS1CQkRDLTg0MEM4RUY5MDY4N0BjbGVhci5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":47356,"nextInTopic":47362,"prevInTime":47358,"nextInTime":47360,"topicId":47293,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Her first choice was to stay with my MIL and BIL for a while.  BIL owns a Dominoes pizza and we thought it would be cool for her to work with him for a while. Unfortunately, MIL doesn&#39;t feel well enough to have Claire stay for any length of time. We never even thought of volunteering.
