Giving them responsibility for their own learning is <br/>\nempowering and they are wonderful wonderful kids - but many also suffer from <br/>\na lot of depression and anxiety at that age. They have MUCH bigger dreams and <br/>\nambitions than most schooled kids. They don&#39;t think, for example, of just <br/>\ngoing to college and getting a job. NOT FOR THEM!!!! They have huge ideals - <br/>\nthey want to feel fully fulfilled by what they are doing and they often want <br/>\nevery moment of their lives to be filled with pure BLISS!!! Becoming an adult <br/>\ncan be really hard for them.  They really want independence- they place a <br/>\nsuper high value on taking care of themselves and do not want to feel <br/>\ndependent at all. And sometimes this means getting a job to be able to afford <br/>\na car and apartment, etc. They DO struggle, sometimes, with schedules - with <br/>\ncommittment to regular work or study -- not being able to be totally free sp<br/>\nirits. They struggle with working in places where they see inefficiency and <br/>\nlack of creativity - it is much harder for them than for kids who are used to <br/>\nit in school. AND - most of all - the reality that their big dreams are going <br/>\nto take long, hard and often tedious work, begins to really hit them around <br/>\n17 or so and that can feel really discouraging to kids who have been so well <br/>\nsupported in achieving their dreams all their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma *","from":"&quot;zenmomma *&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: adults on Prozac","postDate":"1014745099","msgId":5245,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxMjNVb2F6YnFkUUd3S3dJckwwMDAxOTc0ZUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":5242,"nextInTopic":5246,"prevInTime":5244,"nextInTime":5246,"topicId":5205,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I can drink for fun, and I don&#39;t want alcohol the next <br/>\nday.  But there are some friends of mine who have chosen not to drink at all, <br/>\nand it would be low and mean of me to invite them to drink.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have friends who are prone to depression.  I am too, myself.
