I wouldn&#39;t easily welcome someone into my house who<br/>\n&gt; had a sack on her head.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There was a woman in our old neighborhood who used to do her yardwork with<br/>\n&gt; a sack on her head.

Personal observation, books, the internet, friends and relatives, movies, and magazines are just a few possible sources of information. Making a blanket statement that any one of them are crucial fails to look at the full range of possibilities. When I was getting my master&#39;s degree in library science, there were classes all about information sources and information seeking behavior. In order to know which source would be best, it is usually good to get as much insight into the information seeker as possible. Some of the possible questions to consider when helping a patron are: What is the information going to be used for? Entertainment? Personal use? A class? How soon do they need the information? How in depth does the information need to be? Are they looking for a simple fact? Do they want fiction or nonfiction? Do they prefer print or electronic materials?  Do they want something that they can take with them or something they can use in the library? Those are just a few of the considerations that were brought up. I think it is relevant to unschooling because it can easily be applied to how to provide interesting stuff for our children. My husband and I are both librarians and we usually keep those questions in mind when strewing for our kids. What are THEIR preferences?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf books were crucial, there wouldn&#39;t be the move towards electronic media in many libraries. There is one school library that has moved to eliminate all books in favor of electronic media. For quite a few years, librarians have been discussing the gradual move towards more diversified collections that no longer emphasize books as the be all, end all. There is a huge range of possibilities and trying to claim that one is better than another in all instances misses that. The other day, we got into a discussion of how many teeth a person has. My Gray&#39;s Anatomy book was sitting out where it could easily be reached. It took a lot less time to grab that than it did to go google it. With anatomy type questions, we usually try books first because of the tendency for porn to come up on the Internet. <br/>\n<br/>\nSomething else that seems to be overlooked is that books can contain just as much misinformation as the Internet. Evaluating information (whether fiction or nonfiction) is essential. I think this is where anonymity/misrepresentation fit into this discussion. If an author were to misrepresent themselves or remain anonymous, then they lose credibility. Stephen King and other prolific writers build a reputation for themselves. A lot of times others will try to piggy back on their success by claiming to be like them without having any kind of credentials. If somebody is going to comment on a blog and try to piggy back on somebody else, then they need to be completely honest about who they are so that others can evaluate the information for themselves. If I see a comment and follow a link, then I expect to gain a bit of insight into the person so that I know how serious to take what is being said. In most academic circles, there is a big emphasis on peer review. Articles that are reviewed by somebody within the field are held in higher esteem than articles that are written by people outside of the field. On an unschooling list, I am going to pay more attention to somebody that has multiple grown children that have been unschooled. That is not to say that I am going to ignore somebody that hasn&#39;t been unschooling for a while, but I will use that piece of information to evaluate what I am reading. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But dont books feed the imagination more than the DVD&#39;s , or any other &#39;visual&#39; source ? I have always found , for example, books more engrossing than movies based on these books...books have always given me &#39;time&#39; to think over, form opinons, analyse. I would like to think of books are a very powerful medium despite the new age sources...thoughts ?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That is a personal preference. Each person has his/her own personal preference. It is not accurate to try to make universal claims based on your own experiences. There are quite a few movies that my husband and I watch over and over just to see if we can spot something else cool in them. Movies have the potential to suck people in just as much as books do. I have cried over many, many movies. I tend not to cry over books as much because I tend to skip over parts that are too upsetting. I feel like I have a lot more control when reading a book because I can skim large chunks to get the gist of things without having to focus on anything that is too upsetting. Books are powerful but so are other sources. I will never forget the time that my husband and I went on a road trip and had one of Dave Barry&#39;s books on tape. We listened to the whole book and laughed ourselves silly. I never ever would have sat down to read that book because I have a hard time reading that particular genre. Having somebody else read it and provide sound effects is the only way that I could ever get into it. There are a lot of books that I cannot or will not read because I can&#39;t get into them. The movie of it or an audio version are fine. I don&#39;t particularly like to read Shakespeare but I love to watch his plays acted out in the theater or on the movie screen. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Now books tend to be outdated, and google.com is better for information.&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is not necessarily true. It depends on the type of information that you are seeking and what the purpose is. Google is better for ready reference type information but it does not provide really in depth information. It is a good starting place but it should not be considered a superior information source. It is one source among many. Relying solely on google is just as much a disservice as relying solely on books. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: relative values, &quot;crucial&quot;, openness, and speaking for one&#39;s child","postDate":"1293580250","msgId":58581,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM3M0I2ODY1LUMzNEYtNDQ3RS1CRTlELTU1RTk4QjQyQTQ1MUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlmZHM4cis2Yzk5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlmZHM4cis2Yzk5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58577,"nextInTopic":58582,"prevInTime":58580,"nextInTime":58582,"topicId":58544,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- Coincidentally, we ve just been watching a movie called The Book of Kells which is an animated story of how that particular legendary illuminated text","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-192395003\">-=-<br/>\nCoincidentally, we&#39;ve just been watching a movie called &quot;The Book of Kells&quot; which is an animated story of how that particular legendary illuminated text might have come to be.

I didn&#39;t know her, and never knew whether she had a severe sun allergy, or skin cancer, or was deformed or what.  Cloth bag, all the way over her head.  I might&#39;ve wanted to know more before I invited her to a party at my house, I guess.  But as long as she was in her own yard, what I thought didn&#39;t matter.  What I thought was that she was in her own yard. :-)    <br/>\n<br/>\nShould I have to ask her before I tell people here &quot;I saw a woman doing yardwork with a sack on her head; saw her repeatedly&quot;?  No, because I saw that myself.<br/>\nMy neighbors haven&#39;t been yelling and threatening as much as they used to, or at least not outside.  Probably because it&#39;s winter.  Should I need to ask them before I tell others that my neighbors yell insults and threaten each other?  The police come.  I&#39;ve called three times over the years, but clearly other neighbors call too.    If they said &quot;I don&#39;t want you to tell the people on your discussion list that we yell and threaten each other, or that the police come,&quot; would that be reasonable?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t tell everything my kids do or say.  There is judgment and discretion involved, for various reasons.  But there are things I tell without hesitation, without asking permission.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":138778570,"authorName":"catfish_friend","from":"catfish_friend &lt;catfish_friend@...&gt;","profile":"catfish_friend","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] relative values, &quot;crucial&quot;, openness, and speaking for one&#39;s child","postDate":"1293524305","msgId":58555,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENEQ0NBQjdBLTQwRTctNEUwRC1CQUJELTdDN0M2RURFOEVDOEB5YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDQzMEJBRDVDLURCOTAtNDc1Mi1BMDY2LTAyMUQwQ0I0QkY5OUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDQzMEJBRDVDLURCOTAtNDc1Mi1BMDY2LTAyMUQwQ0I0QkY5OUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":58553,"nextInTopic":58557,"prevInTime":58554,"nextInTime":58556,"topicId":58544,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On Dec 27, 2010, at 9:11 AM, Sandra Dodd  wrote: ... ****** Books are crucial in that they are time capsules, contextualizing the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1825453611\"><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">On Dec 27, 2010, at 9:11 AM, Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n******<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The questions I&#39;d like to discuss are whether books are &quot;crucial,&quot; and about anonymity/misrepresentation, and speaking for one&#39;s child.<br/>\n<br/>\n******<br/>\n<br/>\nBooks are &quot;crucial&quot; in that they are time capsules, contextualizing the process of learning and passing on information amongst literate people especially pre-internet.

There is A LOT bound up there! Especially in regards to unschooling lists like these and all the various forms of blogs unschoolers keep.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 7yr old dd is aware of my internet time in Yahoo-groups-land. Sometimes I&#39;ll read her bits of posts and we&#39;ll talk about them.  Recently she asked that I clear anything I write about her with her first.  When I started our blog I told her I&#39;d never photograph or post anything without her consent.<br/>\n<br/>\n******<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking for one&#39;s child and misrepresentation in the blogosphere is something I&#39;ve been thinking about a lot lately.  I started a blog last fall as a practice run for keeping state-required homeschool documentation next year, when it becomes required.  The things I chose to post at first were clearly &quot;educational.&quot;  I made sure to transcribe key parts of conversation (educational-speaking).  I was, in essence, deciding what was canonical and what wasn&#39;t.  I thought (still do) about what dd may be surmising about learning, or at least the documentation of it, based on the events/photos I select for the blog--what am I privileging?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo then what?  <br/>\n<br/>\nPut the issue of having to &quot;prove&quot; education aside and use the blog to keep family and friends in the loop?  I&#39;m still not in a comfortable space with my &quot;voice,&quot; as &quot;documenter of learning&quot; especially if the audience includes the school district&#39;s super intendant. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter following the links in your post, I realize this isn&#39;t what brought the above questions to mind, for you.  In that example, I found weirdness in appropriating someone else&#39;s (who is powerless, really, to &quot;speak&quot;/write for himself) voice, but beauty in the mother&#39;s voice when she authentically wrote as herself about her opening awareness. The end of the post about a trip to the Natural History Museum reminded me of the thoughts that swirled in my own mind during my early-awakening to unschooling principles.
