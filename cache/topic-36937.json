Had a Spanish class there in college.  We arrived on Three<br/>\nKings Day with carnival in full swing.  There were kids and cotton candy<br/>\neverywhere, mariachi bands, everything.  Despite altitude sickness the<br/>\nentire time, really bad hearing, and not feeling confident about my Spanish<br/>\none bit, I had a blast.  Only place I ever had tequila.  I think I talk way<br/>\nmore than I drink any day, and I really don&#39;t need anything to break ice.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went place to place, and almost to Guadalahara but ran out of time.  The<br/>\nculture is very different from my own, and so interesting.  Unlike the<br/>\nStates, children go wherever anybody else goes and there is little sense of<br/>\na need to separate family members.  Children were as likely to be in the<br/>\nworkplace with their parents as not.  We went to a volcano site by burro<br/>\n(really skinny ones), and spun our &quot;wheels&quot; (on foot) going to the church at<br/>\nthe top.  Amazing.  We went to the Pyramids** of Teotihuacan, and climbed to<br/>\nthe top.  There were people selling things along the way anywhere we went<br/>\nbut as far as I know we didn&#39;t pay fees to get in and there were no gates to<br/>\nspeak of when we went sightseeing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d love to go back.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 8/2/08, diana jenner &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hahamommy@...\">hahamommy@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; They have no opportunities here (Mexico) for two reasons, they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; refuse to learn Spanish (and as such are limited to the people they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; communicate with) and opportunities just don&#39;t exist here for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; homeschooling resources.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As someone who has long dreamed of living in the heart of Mexico with her<br/>\n&gt; children, this is one of the saddest things I&#39;ve ever read...

Math is<br/>\neverywhere.  Kids can feel confident in a number of other ways, by doing<br/>\nthings they love and succeeding in them.  If the need for math hasn&#39;t<br/>\narisen, which is alone is highly suspect, then it will eventually, in<br/>\nthe way that each individual will need it to get what they want in life.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough, I didn&#39;t keep the original text here, the poster has mentioned<br/>\nthat all of the kids are translating peso and dollars which is pretty<br/>\nuseful and requires mathematics.

Whether that is hire a tutor, find a tutor if I cannot afford one, pay for extra remedial classes, do his laundry so he has more time to study, etc.; whatever it takes that I can do, I will.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you looked at some past posts about strewing for teens - this might help you figure out some things you could do to enrich their lives.  My son spends a huge amount of time on various games.  He currently is happily playing a few computer games.  He also has a Wii system and a Playstation II that he enjoys.  While on the computer he is connecting with other players all over the world.  He says his favorite games are strategy games.  Who knows where this will lead - I don&#39;t worry about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe still loves Lego&#39;s - I invested a lot of money in Lego&#39;s this past spring.  He had not asked for new legos in a couple of years though he did play with what he had off and on.  Then all of a sudden this spring he was creating all over the place and &quot;needed&quot; more.   Who knows where that will lead - maybe he will work for Lego, Lego Land, or a design/construction something or other or perhaps he will go to college and become a structural engineer - or maybe he will have fond memories of Lego&#39;s as an adult and enjoy playing with his child ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if &quot;all&quot; I&#39;m doing is &quot;building&quot; a better future parent?????   I cannot think of anything better actually!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI do know it is hard to let go of the fear - but this list has been the best for me/us.  I joined a year ago (last summer) because the doubts were creeping in as my son turned 13 and he was now a teen and it was much easier when he was younger ....... This list helped me over that hump and I&#39;ve relaxed again into the belief that he will learn it when he needs to/wants to.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example our son being 14 makes me worry sometimes (more like a fleeting thought) when he asks things like &quot;mom, is 2+6, 8?&quot;  To which I answered  &quot;yes&quot;    THEN  the very next day we were at Costco - which is a large wholesale place that sells in multi-packs - Hubby and I were looking at something that was 4 packs of 30 - Zac walked up and said there are 120 in the box.  He did multiplication in his head instantly - didn&#39;t even stop to think about it.   I could have sworn he does not know multiplication ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Crisis of Faith","postDate":"1217645528","msgId":36942,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZGNkE5MUJGLTQ1NTMtNEM3Qi1CNjg1LUFDQzA1NEQ0N0EzREBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ4OTNBMjc3LjEwMDAyMDBAZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDQ4OTM1OEZFLjQwMjA3MDdAZ21haWwuY29tPiA8RUZFNDVCQTctMkVDRC00QTgxLUEyMUEtREU1MzkzMkIwNzRCQHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8NDg5M0EyNzcuMTAwMDIwMEBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":36941,"nextInTopic":36943,"prevInTime":36941,"nextInTime":36943,"topicId":36937,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Do you intend to come across as a holier-than-thou and unaccepting?

If you need unschooling  <br/>\nencouragment, you can get help here or on other unschooling lists.   <br/>\nIf you don&#39;t need help, you don&#39;t need this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe quote below (to the end of this e-mail) was in response to  <br/>\ncomplaints that some people&#39;s advice on another list was too direct  <br/>\n(perhaps too holier-than-thou and unaccepting; I didn&#39;t see the  <br/>\ncomplaints outside of this first little quoted bit)<br/>\n<br/>\n============================================================<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\naggressive advice/responses are a good way to go for some... but<br/>\nsome may want a gentler touch.<br/>\n<br/>\nI once felt like you about the posting style.  I hooked up with<br/>\nanother dissatisfied newbie unschooler and we started our own kinder,<br/>\ngentler unschooling support group.  It didn&#39;t work out the way we<br/>\nexpected.  At first, we mostly discussed how attacked we felt on the<br/>\nmore popular lists, this one included.  Once we got past that, the<br/>\ngroup just didn&#39;t really help me toward unschooling.  Instead, we<br/>\ncoddled one another on the areas where we were having trouble.  We<br/>\njustified our excuses for not being able to truly unschool all areas<br/>\nof life.  Rather than learning how to confront those monsters that<br/>\nkept us at bay from living freely, we stayed in the safe place.  I<br/>\nlearned that safe place isn&#39;t where I want to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nI took the seasoned unschoolers advice and learned to look at the<br/>\nposts on a non-personal level.  I no longer think the posts are<br/>\naggressive.  The style here is assertive and confident.  Sometimes I<br/>\ndo disagree with what someone says.  And that&#39;s okay because I can<br/>\nmull it over in my mind and try to figure out why I disagree so<br/>\nmuch.  I must say that when I really looked at the things that<br/>\nbothered me the most, those were the things that were really keeping<br/>\nme from living freely and joyfully.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m generally not the type of person that responds well to assertive<br/>\ntechniques.  I have shed many a tear thinking people just didn&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand me.  But in truth, they did and do understand.  It&#39;s taken<br/>\nme years to grow and become more assertive and confident in myself.<br/>\nThis is exactly why I think unschooling is so great for my children.<br/>\nIf I hold onto the arbitrary rules and beliefs that didn&#39;t make me<br/>\nhappy, then I wasn&#39;t allowing my children to be happy either.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that may help is to space out the posts a bit.  If you ask<br/>\na question or participate in a discussion, don&#39;t read all the<br/>\nresponses at one time.  Read 1 or 2 and think about them before<br/>\nreading more or responding.  Maybe even journal your thoughts so you<br/>\ncan go back and physically view what your mind is processing.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, when I really started actively looking into my thought<br/>\nprocesses, I saw that I was feeling disrespected.  I felt like all<br/>\nthe housework was on my shoulders.  I felt like all the child care<br/>\nresponsibility was mine.  I felt like I had to be someone different<br/>\nto please my husband.  But all of those were distorted perceptions.<br/>\nMy children didn&#39;t make messes to make me miserable.  They were just<br/>\ntrying to be happy.  They didn&#39;t want to stay up late because they<br/>\nwanted to affect my sleep.  I was too personally involved in<br/>\neverything.  Once I really learned to step back and not look at<br/>\neverything in my life as something done personally to me, I was able<br/>\nto readjust my thinking.  And it&#39;s been like a floodgate lifted.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I&#39;m rambling on too much now.  I really do understand where you<br/>\nare coming from.  I came to unschooling in stages, over the last 4<br/>\nyears.  I say we&#39;re unschoolers but I&#39;m still not exactly where I<br/>\nwant to be.  I&#39;m still learning each day along with my children.  It<br/>\nhas helped me to understand that the concept of unschooling isn&#39;t<br/>\nreally about my children at all.  It&#39;s about changing what I&#39;m<br/>\nthinking and how I live.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":221613064,"authorName":"Kathy and Jamie","from":"Kathy and Jamie &lt;jamnkats@...&gt;","profile":"greenschool3","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Crisis of Faith","postDate":"1217640481","msgId":36940,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ4OTNCODIxLjIwNTAzMDRAZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDZkZWM0OGIwODA4MDExNzU1cDEyNzU0ZTZkbDM4NzlhMWE2MWQ5MWE2YWFAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDQ4OTM1OEZFLjQwMjA3MDdAZ21haWwuY29tPiA8NmRlYzQ4YjA4MDgwMTE3NTVwMTI3NTRlNmRsMzg3OWExYTYxZDkxYTZhYUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":36939,"nextInTopic":36941,"prevInTime":36939,"nextInTime":36941,"topicId":36937,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yes, I understand that unschooling has nothing to do with academics.

The second <br/>\nproblem I see is that college seems to be a desire mainly because <br/>\nthey&#39;re not exactly sure WHAT to do and know that many kids choose <br/>\ncollege after schooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do see value in doing some type of curriculum as it will allow them to <br/>\ndecide if the subject interests them, it will allow them to see what <br/>\nacademics is about (and as such, they might have a greater ability to <br/>\ndecide if college is indeed their desire) and probably other stuff we <br/>\nwon&#39;t know until we try. <br/>\n<br/>\nI worry that we&#39;re aren&#39;t doing enough to provide them what they need to <br/>\nbe happy and successful in whatever they decide they want to achieve, <br/>\nespecially since they say they desire to attend college.

We traveled (RV) for 3 years before <br/>\nwe put down roots in Mexico and they got a lot of culture and history <br/>\nthat way but this past year they just seem to be stagnating (IMO).  <br/>\nThey&#39;re not complaining as long as they have unlimited computer and <br/>\ninternet access.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m thinking that unschooling, the way we&#39;ve always done it, is not <br/>\nenriching their lives.  Because I honestly don&#39;t see (and the 12 and 14 <br/>\nyo will agree, though they may be telling me what they think I want to <br/>\nhear to some degree) that playing Age of Empires and Runescape are <br/>\nreally opening them to new experiences, ideas and concepts.  And I don&#39;t <br/>\nsee how it prepares them for the outside world.<br/>\nThe boys (12 and 14) do not know how to multiply.  They do not know <br/>\nfractions or decimals or percents.  Their math is limited to converting <br/>\npesos to dollars and dollars to pesos, which is a skill that is useful, <br/>\nand can make change (but I don&#39;t think they could make change in US <br/>\ncoins and I know the girls have no idea what quarters, dimes and nickels <br/>\nare but do know pesos and centavos).  Making change is a HUGE skill and <br/>\nI&#39;m glad for that but they are really limited in their mad math skillz.  <br/>\nI introduced the concept of opening themselves to new concepts and <br/>\nchallenging themselves and they both decided they wanted (though I truly <br/>\ndoubt they would have considered the idea themselves and thought it a <br/>\nlovely idea) to do the Teaching Textbooks curriculum and have been doing <br/>\nit daily.  They listen to the lesson without complaint and do as much <br/>\nwork as they decide they need to do.  They seem to be getting <br/>\nsatisfaction from the exposure to new concepts and self esteem from <br/>\nmastering a new skill.  And I see all that as positive.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;m thinking of further curriculum.  The girls (8 and 6) are easy - <br/>\nthey want to work on cursive (I already have books I&#39;ve purchased <br/>\n(Spanish) down here that they adore) and math.  So I got some math <br/>\nworkbooks and have Singapore books coming for them and we&#39;ll do whatever <br/>\nthey want to do.  Neither girl is reading<br/>\nbut that doesn&#39;t concern me as the boys learned to read without any <br/>\n&quot;lessons&quot; or manipulation on my part and I can see the same signs in the <br/>\ngirls.  The 8yo just started doing inventive spelling, so no worries <br/>\nthere, though I did purchase some Explode the Code books because I know <br/>\nhow much they enjoy workbooks and I like to have a variety around for <br/>\nthem.  I&#39;ve looked into stuff and I&#39;m pretty convinced I&#39;ll buy stuff <br/>\nand if nothing else, I&#39;m going to learn about Ancient Cultures and delve <br/>\ninto Latin (my 14yo expressed a desire to learn Latin) and hone my mad <br/>\nwriting skilz.<br/>\nSo my question is how much to push curriculum/learning/academics on <br/>\nthem?  They have no opportunities here (Mexico) for two reasons, they <br/>\nrefuse to learn Spanish (and as such are limited to the people they can <br/>\ncommunicate with) and opportunities just don&#39;t exist here for <br/>\nhomeschooling resources.  The math leads me to believe that very slow <br/>\nexposure, supported by confidence built by mastery can only enrich their <br/>\nlives but am I convincing myself because I feel &quot;safer&quot; for their <br/>\nfutures if they can show mastery of society&#39;s accepted skills (3 R&#39;s)?<br/>\nI feel like I&#39;ve walked the walk but now that it isn&#39;t so easy and the <br/>\nkids are getting older I&#39;m falling for the &quot;unschooling won&#39;t provide a <br/>\ngood foundation&quot; argument.
