He didn&#39;t know a whole lot about 5 and 7 yo boys when we got married, so he followed my lead.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was the one motivated to learn about homeschooling and then unschooling.  I was the one who read all the books and spent hours on message boards and lists.  I shared my knowledge as much as I could, and he took in what he wanted from it.  Then, when he started protesting based on his limited knowledge and experience, that&#39;s when I challenged him to read the books and the message boards and the lists.  I told him if he did that--if he became more knowledgeable and experienced on the subject than I had become in 2 or 3 years--THEN we&#39;d talk, and he *might* even be able to change my mind.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure this is the same thing he was thinking when I questioned how he was cutting that fancy angle into the deck top.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter reading Sandra and Pam and Joyce and Deb and Pam-I-Am, et al, for *years*, I knew it would be more years before he could hold a candle to me in an argument about homeschooling.

Eventually I learned that he would go off on his business trips and spend time on airplanes talking to strangers about homeschooling.

After I was reading about the Sudbury Valley Schools I<br/>\nwent to their site.  There is one in Sacramento, where we are planning on<br/>\nmoving too later this year, and I talked to him about it.
