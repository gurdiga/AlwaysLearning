Finding a prep cook job can be a challange for someone with no experience in restaurants. Most non-graduates start as a dishwasher, which in my opinion is the very best place to start. Dishwasher is the most important position in a kitchen. It helps one learn speed and attention to detail, two vital skills. Often times, when the restaurant is not busy, a dishwasher is utilized to do simple prep work, such as cleaning veggies, chopping, or making stock. Many dishwashers who prove their worth don&#39;t stay dishwashers for long. Prepping requires some skills that many people new to the industry aren&#39;t aware of, such as good knife skills and knowledge of the difference between cooking at home (for 2-6 people) vs cooking in quantity (anywhere between 10 and 50 servings). If he has never worked in a restaurant, attempting to step in to a non-entry level position such as prep cook can be difficult. I would expect someone who started as a DWer, who shows a willingness to learn, speed and stamina to be cooking on the line within a year.  Restaurant cooking can be a physically and mentally exhausting job that many people decide is not for them. Finding that out before spending a ton of money on school is a good idea.\r<br/>\nIf you have any more questions, please feel free to ask me!\r<br/>\nElissa Jill\r<br/>\nSent on the Sprint� Now Network from my BlackBerry�\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n-----Original Message-----\r<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:d.lewis@...\">d.lewis@...</a>&gt;\r<br/>\nDate: Wed, 21 Apr 2010 07:40:01 \r<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;\r<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Unschooling and the Adult Child\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n***Try hotels, resorts or casinos.

Granted, I still have babies<br/>\n&gt; (and when I think of them going away as young adults, I get teary), but I<br/>\n&gt; also have a teen and pre-teen, and I can imagine them being around for a<br/>\n&gt; long, long time.  Also, we run a family business, in a way that would make<br/>\n&gt; it really cool if they decided to be part of it when they are young adults.<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t expect them to, but if they wanted to, that would be fun.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think if you follow a philosophy of *unschooling,* but you think of it<br/>\n&gt; less as a *method of education* and more as just living and learning and<br/>\n&gt; loving life together, then the concern or fear or whatever about them not<br/>\n&gt; heading out on their own at a certain, proscribed age or point in life,<br/>\n&gt; might really not occur to you, or bother you that much.  The idea of having<br/>\n&gt; &quot;expectations&quot; based on a certain age really doesn&#39;t make sense, given<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;ve led your life as if the typical societal expectations (that they<br/>\n&gt; should read at 5, and be in Little League, and do Algebra I in 7th grade,<br/>\n&gt; and go to prom at 17) don&#39;t apply.  Why should it suddenly matter at 18?<br/>\n&gt; Why expectations?  Why, &quot;Ok, now you&#39;re 18, time to either get a job or go<br/>\n&gt; to college&quot;?  I think that would fly in the face of unschooling/Always<br/>\n&gt; Learning principles and philosophy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If I think about just continuing to love life with my kids, and growing with<br/>\n&gt; them, I can&#39;t imagine them NOT going off and following their natural urges<br/>\n&gt; to become independent of us, and yet, I can totally imagine still supporting<br/>\n&gt; them here at our house, and having them be a part of our lives until they<br/>\n&gt; are able (financially or otherwise) and willing to go do their own thing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My husband and I, both formally over-educated beyond stupidity, have agreed<br/>\n&gt; for a long time that we don&#39;t care one way or another if our kids choose to<br/>\n&gt; go to college or not.  College, and for that matter, further post-secondary<br/>\n&gt; education and credentialing, do not make life better or happier or more<br/>\n&gt; productive or whatever those things are supposed to promise for young<br/>\n&gt; adults.  As for work, I fully believe that a young person who has grown up<br/>\n&gt; with lots of choices and independence has a natural tendency to seek out<br/>\n&gt; those activities that make them feel fulfilled or happy or content.  I know<br/>\n&gt; for myself that when I was just 14 or 15, I was already imagining and<br/>\n&gt; dreaming about my own home, my own life separate from my parents, and that<br/>\n&gt; the mere excitement of being free to set up house when I was old enough to<br/>\n&gt; have a job and earn money and make that a reality was just fascinating.  Our<br/>\n&gt; kids are already earning money, because they want to, not because we *make*<br/>\n&gt; them -- because it&#39;s fun and interesting and gives them the opportunity to<br/>\n&gt; buy stuff they want.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If the idea of unschooling conjures fearful images of *lazy* or<br/>\n&gt; *unmotivated* young adults who would rather mooch off their parents in<br/>\n&gt; perpetuity, well, I have to just flatly disagree with that idea (it&#39;s such a<br/>\n&gt; silly cliche, anyway).  A kid who has spent his or her young years working<br/>\n&gt; and playing and learning alongside caring, loving, interesting adults, is<br/>\n&gt; going to have every reason to become a caring, loving, interesting adult who<br/>\n&gt; is involved in relationships and activities him or herself.  I can&#39;t imagine<br/>\n&gt; my passionate 9-year-old step-son losing interest in life, or becoming<br/>\n&gt; fearful of leaving our nest, unless he was somehow given the impression that<br/>\n&gt; he should lose interest, or that he isn&#39;t capable of seeking out his own,<br/>\n&gt; independent living situation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If anything, I think the school culture of being told what to do, being<br/>\n&gt; constantly judged against yourself and against others, of being put in a box<br/>\n&gt; with a label, of being bored out of your mind for long stretches, of being<br/>\n&gt; emotionally beat up regularly, could lead to that outcome much more<br/>\n&gt; commonly.  How shocking for the typically-schooled young adult, at 18, to<br/>\n&gt; find oneself finally in a position to make decisions in a world of millions<br/>\n&gt; of decisions.  To find oneself suddenly without a report card to tell you<br/>\n&gt; how you&#39;re doing, without a teacher or guidance counselor or guru telling<br/>\n&gt; you what line to get in, without a textbook or a class schedule!  In my<br/>\n&gt; case, I knew the only answer was college, because I didn&#39;t know how to do<br/>\n&gt; anything BUT school.  And I nearly had a nervous breakdown as the end of<br/>\n&gt; college approached.  The answer?  More school.  And after that?  More.  It<br/>\n&gt; took a good damn brush with my own mortality to finally break free of the<br/>\n&gt; addiction to being told where to go, what to do, when.  I learned that the<br/>\n&gt; only things I really, truly cared about in this life were: growing things,<br/>\n&gt; being with family, and writing.  And so I quit jumping through hoops and<br/>\n&gt; followed those loves, many years after I could have embraced them.  My whole<br/>\n&gt; life, I was told that growing things was &quot;just a hobby,&quot; as was writing, and<br/>\n&gt; that family was what you had on the evenings and weekends when you got away<br/>\n&gt; from your job.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, my husband and I farm and hang out with our family, despite multiple<br/>\n&gt; degrees and credentials and crap that never mattered.  I don&#39;t want my kids<br/>\n&gt; to experience that hoop-jumping idiocy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would almost be willing to bet that unschooling / always learning prepares<br/>\n&gt; kids more for the *responsibilities* and independence of life away from the<br/>\n&gt; nest than traditional school does, for all those reasons.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve babbled too much.  I just *heard* in your posted questions the fear<br/>\n&gt; that a lot of people have when they think of unschooling (lazy kids doing<br/>\n&gt; nothing!  When will they do Something???) -- and I think it requires a<br/>\n&gt; letting go of all those typical societal, age-based expectations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Deb<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

One place told him that although his desire was to work in the kitchen and they had openings in the kitchen, the personality test they administered him said he was better suited working directly with the customers and they didn&#39;t have any positions for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn apprenticeship would be wonderful. I&#39;ve thought about that for awhile but am not really sure how one would go about getting one if it&#39;s not advertised. I guess the thing to do would be to just go to various restaurants and ask. <br/>\n<br/>\n== If your son wants to take a break from school and opted to take responsibility for more things at home, would that be a middle ground your husband would agree to? Some ideas of things your son could do at home: pay bills and balance the checkbook (a skill that&#39;s necessary to know when he&#39;s on his own); buy groceries and prepare dinner; be sure your car always has gas and is clean; the yardwork; etc. Would your son be agreeable to doing some of those things on a regular basis instead of getting a paying job? Or does he have suggestions of ways he can contribute? Right now he may not feel he offers much value to the household (in his dad&#39;s eyes) if he&#39;s not working or in school, so brainstorm with him and think outside the box and take some ideas to your husband as alternatives.==<br/>\n<br/>\nThis type of thing might work. He already does things for me around the house. He does the grocery shopping a lot because I hate to do that and cooks meals (another one of my least favorite things to do). He cleans the car and does yard work when I ask him. He takes out the trash (most of the time). I think I need to find a better way of presenting all of this to my husband. Since he&#39;s not home much he doesn&#39;t see what happens on a daily basis. <br/>\n<br/>\n== Oh, going back to an earlier post in this thread, hanging out with friends, skateboarding and playing video games may be how your son is processing the pressure he&#39;s feeling. It may look to you like he&#39;s doing nothing, but in reality he may be doing the best he can to deal with the pressure without buckling under it.==<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with this. I know my original post probably made it sound like I thought those things were equivalent to doing nothing but that&#39;s not how I think.

I know lots of people who&#39;ve had lots of parental support throughout their lives. They live and work on the family farm, or they had the down payment on their house paid for by their parents or they had their college education funded by their folks, or they do volunteer work to buffer their c.v. while before they get a job. In the UK it was traditional to have a gap year. A year between college (high school) and university. That was probably buffered quite mightily with parental aid. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_year\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_year</a> is an interesting discussion of the Gap year. Interestingly among the Ache, a hunter-gatherer group of Paraguay, young men aren&#39;t really competent at hunting until they are about 30 or so. They are buffered by their community and by their immediate family. The timing of their competence seems to coincide with the timing of their ability to get a wife, amazingly enough. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, maybe folks have glossed over some of the details of history and when children leave home.

I think about that all the time, the cost in comparison to him being far away at college. My biggest hurdle is my husband. He can&#39;t seem to get past the idea that our son should be supporting himself now since he&#39;s legally an adult. He thinks not providing him anything but the bare necessities will motivate (force) him to get a job. I think that&#39;s harsh and unfair. Maybe I should run a cost comparison of tuition, supplies and room and board for college vs. a car.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -=-He needs to find out which English class he tested into before he  <br/>\n&gt; is scheduled to register on Wednesday but he won&#39;t do it.

He says it&#39;s silly that he has to take classes like Expository English and Art or Music Appreciation to cook. I can understand that. I&#39;m going to try searching again for cooking schools that don&#39;t require the general ed classes. I searched before but didn&#39;t find any that we could afford. He also said he&#39;d go to the other community college to discuss their culinary arts program after I suggested that he could start with the culinary classes there and not have to worry about the others for now.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -=-On the one hand, I can understand my husband&#39;s position. Ryan is an  <br/>\n&gt; adult now and you&#39;d think he&#39;d want to get out on his own and be  <br/>\n&gt; independent. On the other hand, he is only 19, just barely an adult,  <br/>\n&gt; and he may need more time to figure out what all of that means-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Remind your husband, maybe, that many 19 year olds are in college  <br/>\n&gt; getting drunk and puking and meeting undesirable people.  Many other  <br/>\n&gt; 19 year olds are parents already.  Maybe your son should get some  <br/>\n&gt; credit for being home and neither drunk nor yet a father.  Maybe  <br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s worth the loan of a car, even if you had to borrow money to get  <br/>\n&gt; the car.  Maybe.  Depends.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is an excellent point. I will definitely remind my husband of this. The ways that we interact with/treat Ryan has always been a sticking point for us. My husband thinks I&#39;m too soft and I think he&#39;s too rigid. So we go round and round about this. My husband gets unschooling with the younger ones but not with the older one. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think this is really about money for my husband. I think he&#39;s using that as a reason for his position. I think what it really is, though, is that he&#39;s stuck in that mindset that it&#39;s bad for us to give Ryan this stuff. I can&#39;t quite explain it because I really don&#39;t understand it. I think that whatever we have, we should give to our children at least as much as we give to ourselves. My husband thinks that if we just give Ryan these things, he won&#39;t learn to be responsible and self-sufficient. When Ryan was younger my husband conceded a lot of this to me but now that Ryan is an adult my husband is digging in his heals more. I&#39;m struggling with whether to just put my foot and tell my husband how it&#39;s going to be Ryan or doing some of what my husband wants when I know it&#39;s not the best for Ryan.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlysia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Unschooling and the Adult Child","postDate":"1271793360","msgId":53125,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERDMEVFN0I1LTJCMDQtNDQ2Ny1CNzg0LTBFNkY1MTBCMUJFOUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhxa3ZoMytxZmI1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhxa3ZoMytxZmI1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":53123,"nextInTopic":53127,"prevInTime":53124,"nextInTime":53126,"topicId":53034,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=This is what my husband is doing and I don t like it.

The pressuring part. I&#39;m trying to be supportive and encouraging to my 19 year old, Ryan, about getting a job and/or taking college classes without making him feel pressured. <br/>\n<br/>\nRyan says he wants to get a job but it&#39;s really hard right now, especially when you are young and don&#39;t have much work experience. I get that. Part of the problem is, I think, because he doesn&#39;t really know how to go after a job. I try to talk to him about having to do more than just turn in an application but he shuts down. Refuses to listen. He says he&#39;s doing what he can. I don&#39;t see him out there doing that every day, though. What I see is him hanging out with his friends, skateboarding or playing video games.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has said since he was 12 that he wants to be a chef and own his own restaurant. One of the community colleges near us has a culinary arts program. It&#39;s about an hour away, though, and we don&#39;t have an extra car so he&#39;d have to use my car. That would mean me and the little ones would be stuck at home most days. So I said he could take the general ed classes that are required at the closer community college and then after a year or so he could transfer to the other one. My hope was/is that by then he&#39;d have a job and we could get him his own car. We can buy him a car but we can&#39;t afford to pay for his insurance, which is why he would need to get a job to have use of the car. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe signed up for 3 classes for the spring semester but got dropped from all 3 classes for missing too many days. He says he didn&#39;t mean to do that and he does still want to take classes. Now it&#39;s time for summer registration and he doesn&#39;t seem interested. He needs to find out which English class he tested into before he is scheduled to register on Wednesday but he won&#39;t do it. I&#39;m thinking maybe he doesn&#39;t really want to. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d be ok with him not going this summer but I&#39;m getting a lot of pressure from my husband to get Ryan to do something because he&#39;s legally an adult now. My husband says we provide him with food and shelter and that&#39;s enough. We shouldn&#39;t be giving him anything else unless he works and/or goes to school. For example, my husband said I should not let Ryan use the car unless he can pay for the gas, knowing full well that he can&#39;t because he doesn&#39;t have a job. That seems unfair to me within the ideas and principles of unschooling. It&#39;s very common within mainstream parenting and living.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the one hand, I can understand my husband&#39;s position. Ryan is an adult now and you&#39;d think he&#39;d want to get out on his own and be independent. On the other hand, he is only 19, just barely an adult, and he may need more time to figure out what all of that means. For the most part, I don&#39;t mind him taking more time to figure things out. I do have some concerns and fears about him just hanging out with his friends. I&#39;m not sure how to go about helping him find what he needs without him feeling pressured.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlysia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223803785,"authorName":"Su Penn","from":"Su Penn &lt;su@...&gt;","profile":"marie101365","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Unschooling and the Adult Child","postDate":"1271770863","msgId":53069,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI0NkZFMTNCLTMwOEEtNDExRi04QTJFLUEwNzNBM0Y5NDdFNUBzdXBlbm4uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDczNThGNjBDLTIzRDYtNDQwNC1COUNCLTlGMkJFODhFQTQxNEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGhxaWM4ZCs4bHJjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NjAwODk1LjQxNTU2LnFtQHdlYjExMDQxNS5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+IDw3MzU4RjYwQy0yM0Q2LTQ0MDQtQjlDQi05RjJCRTg4RUE0MTRAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":53054,"nextInTopic":53075,"prevInTime":53068,"nextInTime":53070,"topicId":53034,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Nearly all of my close friends went to college right out of high school, and graduated four years later (give or take a semester). Nearly all of us, though, later went back to school for various reasons. I went back in my 30s to get the English major I&#39;d always wanted, just for fun (my parents were paying for college and wouldn&#39;t let me major in English the first time around). My partner David went back as an undergrad after working as a librarian for several years and finding that the computer aspect of librarianship was the most fun for him; he studied computer science and is now a software engineer.

From a certain perspective, it was a waste of time and money, even though we enjoyed ourselves and learned a lot. Enjoying ourselves and learning a lot are certainly worthwhile, but we _thought_ we were there to get the education that would prepare us for our lives and careers. And it didn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, from that experience, I don&#39;t assume or expect my kids will go to college in their late teens. Unlike all the people around us whose kids at 9 or 10 already expect to go to college (one of my son&#39;s friends talked about it to us the other day; he&#39;s 10), to the extent it&#39;s come up at all I&#39;ve said to the kids that it&#39;s one thing they might choose to do when they get older. I think it makes sense for college to be a more considered decision than &quot;it&#39;s what you must do.&quot; Does the person have a career in mind they&#39;d like to explore? Is there something specific they&#39;re interested in learning? Do they want to have fun and learn a lot? Is college the best way for them to do any of those things? If so, does that mean being an on-campus student at a 4-year college or university, or something else?<br/>\n<br/>\nCollege is very expensive, most of the time. I&#39;m happy to put what resources I have towards that for my children. But if, at the same age, they want to keep living at home, work a part-time job, and hang out with their friends a lot, I&#39;d be happy to help with that, too. Or if they wanted to travel. Or had an art or something else they wanted to explore.

There are fantastic diary and letter collections from women like that in South Dakota and Minnesota and Montana. Redmond O&#39;Hanlon, I think, talks about a couple of spinster sisters who homesteaded in South Dakota, I think. Maybe I&#39;m blurring books, maybe their story is separate and intact and not in his book badlands. Women who didn&#39;t marry had to make a way for themselves. In the UK I think there were more servants options available. There is a tombstone in Bury St. Edmund, in the cautionary graveyard, that speaks of the girl buried beneath. She was a household servant who was hung because she let her lover into the house to do her master and mistress harm and to rob the house. So, that was an option open to some of the unmarried women in the UK. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYoung women in some cultures, even this one a long time ago, weren&#39;t able to leave home without getting married.

Granted, I still have babies<br/>\n(and when I think of them going away as young adults, I get teary), but I<br/>\nalso have a teen and pre-teen, and I can imagine them being around for a<br/>\nlong, long time.  Also, we run a family business, in a way that would make<br/>\nit really cool if they decided to be part of it when they are young adults.<br/>\nI don&#39;t expect them to, but if they wanted to, that would be fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think if you follow a philosophy of *unschooling,* but you think of it<br/>\nless as a *method of education* and more as just living and learning and<br/>\nloving life together, then the concern or fear or whatever about them not<br/>\nheading out on their own at a certain, proscribed age or point in life,<br/>\nmight really not occur to you, or bother you that much.  The idea of having<br/>\n&quot;expectations&quot; based on a certain age really doesn&#39;t make sense, given<br/>\nyou&#39;ve led your life as if the typical societal expectations (that they<br/>\nshould read at 5, and be in Little League, and do Algebra I in 7th grade,<br/>\nand go to prom at 17) don&#39;t apply.  Why should it suddenly matter at 18?<br/>\nWhy expectations?  Why, &quot;Ok, now you&#39;re 18, time to either get a job or go<br/>\nto college&quot;?  I think that would fly in the face of unschooling/Always<br/>\nLearning principles and philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I think about just continuing to love life with my kids, and growing with<br/>\nthem, I can&#39;t imagine them NOT going off and following their natural urges<br/>\nto become independent of us, and yet, I can totally imagine still supporting<br/>\nthem here at our house, and having them be a part of our lives until they<br/>\nare able (financially or otherwise) and willing to go do their own thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I, both formally over-educated beyond stupidity, have agreed<br/>\nfor a long time that we don&#39;t care one way or another if our kids choose to<br/>\ngo to college or not.  College, and for that matter, further post-secondary<br/>\neducation and credentialing, do not make life better or happier or more<br/>\nproductive or whatever those things are supposed to promise for young<br/>\nadults.  As for work, I fully believe that a young person who has grown up<br/>\nwith lots of choices and independence has a natural tendency to seek out<br/>\nthose activities that make them feel fulfilled or happy or content.  I know<br/>\nfor myself that when I was just 14 or 15, I was already imagining and<br/>\ndreaming about my own home, my own life separate from my parents, and that<br/>\nthe mere excitement of being free to set up house when I was old enough to<br/>\nhave a job and earn money and make that a reality was just fascinating.  Our<br/>\nkids are already earning money, because they want to, not because we *make*<br/>\nthem -- because it&#39;s fun and interesting and gives them the opportunity to<br/>\nbuy stuff they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the idea of unschooling conjures fearful images of *lazy* or<br/>\n*unmotivated* young adults who would rather mooch off their parents in<br/>\nperpetuity, well, I have to just flatly disagree with that idea (it&#39;s such a<br/>\nsilly cliche, anyway).  A kid who has spent his or her young years working<br/>\nand playing and learning alongside caring, loving, interesting adults, is<br/>\ngoing to have every reason to become a caring, loving, interesting adult who<br/>\nis involved in relationships and activities him or herself.  I can&#39;t imagine<br/>\nmy passionate 9-year-old step-son losing interest in life, or becoming<br/>\nfearful of leaving our nest, unless he was somehow given the impression that<br/>\nhe should lose interest, or that he isn&#39;t capable of seeking out his own,<br/>\nindependent living situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anything, I think the school culture of being told what to do, being<br/>\nconstantly judged against yourself and against others, of being put in a box<br/>\nwith a label, of being bored out of your mind for long stretches, of being<br/>\nemotionally beat up regularly, could lead to that outcome much more<br/>\ncommonly.  How shocking for the typically-schooled young adult, at 18, to<br/>\nfind oneself finally in a position to make decisions in a world of millions<br/>\nof decisions.  To find oneself suddenly without a report card to tell you<br/>\nhow you&#39;re doing, without a teacher or guidance counselor or guru telling<br/>\nyou what line to get in, without a textbook or a class schedule!  In my<br/>\ncase, I knew the only answer was college, because I didn&#39;t know how to do<br/>\nanything BUT school.  And I nearly had a nervous breakdown as the end of<br/>\ncollege approached.  The answer?  More school.  And after that?  More.  It<br/>\ntook a good damn brush with my own mortality to finally break free of the<br/>\naddiction to being told where to go, what to do, when.  I learned that the<br/>\nonly things I really, truly cared about in this life were: growing things,<br/>\nbeing with family, and writing.  And so I quit jumping through hoops and<br/>\nfollowed those loves, many years after I could have embraced them.  My whole<br/>\nlife, I was told that growing things was &quot;just a hobby,&quot; as was writing, and<br/>\nthat family was what you had on the evenings and weekends when you got away<br/>\nfrom your job.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, my husband and I farm and hang out with our family, despite multiple<br/>\ndegrees and credentials and crap that never mattered.  I don&#39;t want my kids<br/>\nto experience that hoop-jumping idiocy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would almost be willing to bet that unschooling / always learning prepares<br/>\nkids more for the *responsibilities* and independence of life away from the<br/>\nnest than traditional school does, for all those reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve babbled too much.  I just *heard* in your posted questions the fear<br/>\nthat a lot of people have when they think of unschooling (lazy kids doing<br/>\nnothing!  When will they do Something???) -- and I think it requires a<br/>\nletting go of all those typical societal, age-based expectations.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Unschooling and the Adult Child","postDate":"1271731611","msgId":53044,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDczNThGNjBDLTIzRDYtNDQwNC1COUNCLTlGMkJFODhFQTQxNEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDYwMDg5NS40MTU1Ni5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MTUubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhxaWM4ZCs4bHJjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NjAwODk1LjQxNTU2LnFtQHdlYjExMDQxNS5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":53042,"nextInTopic":53045,"prevInTime":53043,"nextInTime":53045,"topicId":53034,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-***Would you expect your late teen, early 20s child to work or go to college or would it be ok if they hung out at home and unschooled for a few more years?","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-160919545\">-=-***Would you expect your late teen, early 20s child to work or go  <br/>\nto college or would it be ok if they hung out at home and unschooled  <br/>\nfor a few more years?
