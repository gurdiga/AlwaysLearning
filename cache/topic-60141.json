It is hard to keep up with.  My son started taking<br/>\ntraditional Kung fu and it has helped him learn his own physical boundaries<br/>\nand gave him a sense of his expanding physicality.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also made it very clear to both of my children that any uninvited physical<br/>\ncontact was NOT okay.  We are living in an age where children are charged<br/>\nwith sex offenses because they grabbed another child&#39;s bra band and snapped<br/>\nit.  The deck is stacked against boys because they are so often seen as<br/>\naggressors.  I remember when I was in college and a women&#39;s group put up<br/>\nposters stating that &quot;Every man is a potential rapist&quot;.   We have to make<br/>\nsure that our boys learn how to navigate this often confusing world.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to worry that my son had an issue because when he was 8 or so he just<br/>\ndidn&#39;t seem to get that his behavior was over the top and offensive to other<br/>\nchildren.  Then I started watching other boys that same age and realized<br/>\nthat it seems to be a common problem.  My theory is that at that time boys<br/>\nare just starting to get &quot;big&quot; and more muscular and their ability to know<br/>\nphysical boundaries just doesn&#39;t keep up.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband felt that involvement in some sort of physical discipline that<br/>\nrequired physical work as well as thought was part of the solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son could not handle team sports, it was too much stimulus, he couldn&#39;t<br/>\nkeep up with all of the bodies and action.  Hence the Kung fu.  We started<br/>\nwith a tae kwon do class, but that class used a lot of loud music and had<br/>\nthe kids running circles for most of the class.  NOT a good match.  The<br/>\nschool he is in now is much more traditional and quiet, but requires more<br/>\nphysical work and the teachers are all very supportive and encouraging.<br/>\nThere is no pressure to meet deadlines, just to keep improving your own<br/>\nability and challenging yourself.  My son has learned how to self monitor<br/>\nand through plain old development and practice seems better able to read<br/>\ncues at the age of 14.  So it does take time and work.<br/>\nchris<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: impulse control in an eight-year-old boy","postDate":"1299344912","msgId":60199,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJFQjFCMzFELUVDRUEtNENFNy1BODRDLURENEEzOTE3Mzc4MEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlrc2lpdiszMDRoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlrc2lpdiszMDRoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":60198,"nextInTopic":60200,"prevInTime":60198,"nextInTime":60200,"topicId":60141,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-and I would ask - what do you think made that horrible child do such a terrible thing to you? ...

Oh my, you both seemed to be playing so well!  Why would anyone want to do such a thing to you?

I also stuck close by and remained tuned in – and if I could catch an “assault” before it happened, I could often distract him with something else, or engage him physically to meet his need for physicality.  if I missed the cue (he was FAST sometimes), he reacted very poorly to ME telling him to stop or get off someone (because sometimes his friends actually DID like it and they enjoyed roughhousing – and he felt invaded and judged prematurely if I did that), but I “trained” his close friends to say “I don’t like that” or “stop” if they didn’t like it.  if I could tell by another kid’s face that they weren’t so much enjoying something, a verbal vote of confidence in my son’s good intentions, out loud, helped a lot – I would say something like “if you don’t like that, you can tell him to stop and he will stop right away”  -that helped them avoid victim / perpetrator roles, and also cued my son into the expected response if the child said to stop.  it worked well, quite often.  or, sometimes I’d ask “is that ok with you ___ (friend’s name)?”  and if they shook their head no, I could say to my son “he’s saying that’s not ok” – and that would enable him to let go/stop without feeling shame for his impulse that he couldn’t control.  he didn’t WANT to hurt anyone or offend anyone, he just didn’t get that his friends weren’t enjoying whatever he was doing.  if I got mad, or they got mad, he’d feel deep shame, and would turn that into intense anger, so it was really not an effective way to help him outgrow those tendencies.  <br/>\n<br/>\nthe other thing I realized was that he really needed a lot of sensory input.  so I would wrestle with him, and find lots of outlets for those experiences – hammering, carrying heavy things, pulling, biking, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nat 12.5 now, although he still sometimes overdoes the physicality with friends (and me!), he WILL stop immediately if asked to, and his friends are older too, and more capable of asking him to stop consistently, if they don’t like something.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also had a lot of conversations with him before seeing people, as someone else mentioned – along the lines of “remember ___ doesn’t like the physical stuff so much, but ___ seems to enjoy it”   - or “___ tends to feel pretty overwhelmed with rough play, and freezes and is unable to say stop. so it can help if you ask him if something’s ok first...”  <br/>\n<br/>\nbut mostly, that stuff was important, but time and maturation were essential.  and in the mean time, choosing settings for success was critical.  good luck &lt;3 <br/>\n<br/>\nlyla<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":301108410,"authorName":"Marina DeLuca-Howard","from":"Marina DeLuca-Howard &lt;delucahoward@...&gt;","profile":"matedgirl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: impulse control in an eight-year-old boy","postDate":"1299251025","msgId":60182,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGltUVFZV3dXREQtR3dfcTBCUF9jY29fOGR5MHhWeGJ5aWg1K0I4SEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEE3MTExMDgyLTI5MEYtNDVGNC1CNkY2LUQ3NTFGODYwMTM4RUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDUzRkU0Mzc5LUM1RDQtNEJCMi05OTYyLTgyREU2NDQ0MDcxN0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JPGlrcGFraytqOTFmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8QUFOTGtUaT14WE5jVWtud3MxaE1kTmN4OHczUGZEUWFQMT1pN2pwRE9qOEY3QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgk8QTcxMTEwODItMjkwRi00NUY0LUI2RjYtRDc1MUY4NjAxMzhFQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":60180,"nextInTopic":60184,"prevInTime":60181,"nextInTime":60183,"topicId":60141,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Start  yourself with respect at home for your husband, & children.

He was playing with her and in his excitement he pushed the skateboard and knocked her to the ground.  Now , I assumed at the time he was trying to push her on the skateboard, like you might push someone on a trike.  He wasnt upset or mad.  I honestly think if he had been those things and pushed her he would have pushed her, not the skateboard.  I was about 10 feet away and they were having fun.  She was hurt and I brought him over to me and explained that she was hurt.

For our situation, the activity changed from the first to the second year - different kids and more of them.  Maybe that&#39;s what happened with your son.  He loved the activity and I played with the group and tried to stay close to him.  I tried to give him as much support as I could, but it wasn&#39;t enough.  He was just not ready for that kind of situation.  So we stopped.  we spent years just going to playgrounds and he&#39;d play with whoever was there.  Or doing activities that were just a few times, because it seemed like he could put up with frustrations for a little while, but week after week it would start to get to him.  We talked a lot about how some activities seem like such fun, but that he was not yet ready to enjoy them.  We found classes for him to take that were small because it seemed like the large group of kids is one of the things that frustrated him.  When things went wrong, we&#39;d talk about it.  I learned to take his side - it was always someone else&#39;s fault.   If I listened to that and agreed with him, after a while, he&#39;d change his own mind and start to come up with things that maybe he could have done differently and what he could do next time differently that would cause a different outcome.

He&#39;s just not ready for this basketball, even though it seemed like he was ready last year.  Cut back, make it simpler for him, and let him find success in something - anything.  In my experience, the qualities that seemed like a liability at 8 years old, morphed into assets by 13.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd also, see if he can do lots of physical activity.  We had a little trampoline in the house, he did lots of wrestling with his dad and brothers, we did climbing, dancing, swimming, tennis.

If<br/>\nyou don&#39;t understand the concept personally, it makes no sense in the<br/>\nabstract.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an adult, around the same time as the &quot;stop&quot; thing I realized that I had<br/>\nvery few well defined boundaries for myself.  I let people yell at me, I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know how to say no, I let people abuse my giving nature.  The key<br/>\npart there was &quot;I let&quot;.  I didn&#39;t tell them to stop, so they quite possibly<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know anything was wrong.  Draven didn&#39;t understand respecting<br/>\nboundaries because he didn&#39;t really understand setting them.  He didn&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand setting them because I never set any for myself.  The first thing<br/>\nI had to do was set boundaries and enforce them in my own life.  I had to<br/>\nhave some concept of personal boundaries before I could help him figure out<br/>\nhow to see the social boundaries.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt some point I started letting him know boundaries existed, and during the<br/>\n&quot;stop&quot; games I differentiated between a temporary stop and a boundary stop.<br/>\n  Not in those words exactly but in tone (playful vs. serious) and in<br/>\nthe explanation that followed.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe love tickle wars and it was a great way to play with &quot;stop&quot;, however I do<br/>\nnot like my feet being tickled, at all.  So when he&#39;d tickle my feet I&#39;d say<br/>\n&quot;stop . . . I really don&#39;t like that, you can tickle me here instead, okay<br/>\nnow go.&quot;  The next time he&#39;d head for my feet I&#39;d remind him before he got<br/>\nthere, or if he did get there I&#39;d say &quot;stop . . . remember not my feet, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t like that, here is better, okay... go&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we would play fight it was the same thing, we would stop to pause the<br/>\naction and catch our breath, but if he hit me in my face I&#39;d stop him and<br/>\nlet him know it wasn&#39;t okay.  One time I grabbed too close to a scratch he<br/>\nhad and he said &quot;stop, I have a cut right there don&#39;t touch near it, okay<br/>\ngo&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI just remembered a game that he started.  He would say &quot;can I tickle<br/>\nyou....&quot; and start tickling my belly &quot;....here?&quot; and I would say &quot;Of course,<br/>\nI love that!&quot;  and then he would tickle my knee, then my underarm, then he&#39;d<br/>\nget near my foot and start giggling madly and say &quot;can I tickle you . . .<br/>\nnope, not here, but&quot; tickling somewhere else &quot;here is good!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe started recognizing the difference and sometimes apologizing if he<br/>\ncrossed a boundary before I even had a chance to say anything.  There were<br/>\nother things I didn&#39;t like him to do, but honestly I can&#39;t think of them<br/>\nanymore because they&#39;ve been a non-issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also talked about his boundaries.  He didn&#39;t like it when I held him<br/>\na certain way.  I had always carried him that way so remembering was hard<br/>\nfor me, but we communicated about it (Stop, remember not to hold me like<br/>\nthat mom) and I apologized for making him uncomfortable when it happened.<br/>\n He didn&#39;t like doctors touching without saying something, so either he or I<br/>\nwould let the doctor know when we first went in for the appointment.  I<br/>\nhelped him make his own boundaries clear, no matter what the situation, and<br/>\nI stood up for his boundaries and my own.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomehow (and it&#39;s been a few years so I can&#39;t remember specifics) it moved<br/>\nfrom his boundaries and my boundaries to other peoples boundaries, and from<br/>\nthere to general boundaries.  It was a constantly evolving open<br/>\ncommunication between us.  Not an, every day, all day kind of conversation,<br/>\nbut something that we touched on pretty regularly.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore we walked into any situation we&#39;d discuss the boundaries that were<br/>\nprobably in effect.

Letting Draven, who was 5 or 6 at the time play with his power<br/>\nby using the word stop, no matter what we were doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo introduce the concept I said something to the point of &quot;stop is the most<br/>\npowerful word in the world, wanna see?&quot;  And I would tickle him and he would<br/>\nyell &quot;stop&quot; and I&#39;d freeze mid air, and not start again until he said go.<br/>\n We&#39;d be walking through the store and he&#39;d say &quot;stop&quot; and I&#39;d freeze.  We<br/>\nplayed stop and go across the yard, in the mall, even when driving (I can&#39;t<br/>\nremember how I approached that part, but he knew to only do it when there<br/>\nwere no cars right behind me, and I would pull over to the side of the road<br/>\nand stop).  He would &quot;stop&quot; me in the middle of a sentence.  We made it a<br/>\ngame, but it was showing him how much power the word stop had.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter some time of that I started playing back with &quot;stop&quot;ping him in fun<br/>\nsituations.  It happened as a give and take.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we moved to more behavior related stuff when it was just him and I (not<br/>\nin a mean or controlling way, but just using the word stop to have him<br/>\nfreeze for a second so I could redirect).  When we started using it around<br/>\nhis friends I made sure I was always right there, and as he started to do<br/>\nsomething that could be perceived as mean I said stop.  His friends picked<br/>\nup on that word working and started directly saying it to him when he was<br/>\ncrossing the line.  On a case by case, situation by situation basis I would<br/>\nallow myself to be further away depending on quite a few things (if the<br/>\nfriend knew Draven well and knew about &quot;stop&quot;, if he were in a calm mood or<br/>\neasily excitable, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI knew it was working because of two different things.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst a friend of his did something to him that he didn&#39;t like and he said<br/>\nstop.  The friend didn&#39;t stop immediately and Draven calmly pointed out that<br/>\nstop meant stop in our house and to please respect his boundaries (another<br/>\nword I taught along the way, a very important one).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second thing that showed me it was working was when he reached to grab<br/>\nsomeones shirt and he whispered stop and froze before he grabbed it.  Then<br/>\nhe redirected himself.  That didn&#39;t happen every time, but more and more<br/>\noften.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;ll be 11 in a few days.  He pretty much listens to any form of stop now,<br/>\nif he doesn&#39;t stop himself first.  However, last month at our first park day<br/>\nafter moving back here he got over excited while a bunch of long lost<br/>\nfriends were playing together and it spiraled out of control in a matter of<br/>\nseconds.

If you know who it is, don&#39;t be guessing, just address the situation.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you respond, if the automatic quote shows that Sandra Dodd wrote.... try to take that off, because I haven&#39;t had an eight year old boy since 1998.  Thanks.<br/>\n====================================================================<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is 8 and has always been very impulsive. He also loves to be a goof ball and make jokes and laugh but is really not good are reading others response to his attempts to be funny or make jokes. He is not really good a reading social cues  and to know when he is going too far.<br/>\nHe really is a loving , caring boy and really sweet to his younger sibling.  At home we really have no problems with this as I can  just tell him straight &quot;hey stop&quot; and facilitate and everything is great. But when not at home, we have been having problems when around groups of kids.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nHe  wants to connect with other kids and be funny and it comes out all wrong plus he does not know when to stop even when told to stop. He, not always, will keep doing it. I do remove him from it.  I do step in and remove him or stop him.  He does stop but sometimes goes on to doing other annoying things.  He touches kids, pulls their hoods back or runs after them waving his arms  and laughing. Its not done in a mean way, he is trying to be funny.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo today he is in his basketball class that he loves and asks to go and the coach is really good. He has been in it for the second year and he is a great player.  This session  there is another boy that plays the same way he does and they feed of each other and it disturbs the class so last week his coach was frustrated with both of them.  Today everything was apparently good until the coach told them to go get a drink and they all ran to the water fountain and this boy got there first so my son grabbed the back of his shirt and pulled him out and down into the floor.<br/>\n <br/>\nNow I know  he did not mean to hurt the kid and it was not in mean spirit towards the other boy that he likes a lot.  He just does not understand, at the moment, what he is doing .He sometimes even thinks it is funny and if someone would get hurt he would feel horrible and he absolutely regrets it.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo in this situation, the boy&#39;s mom was right there and the coach was really upset and has asked that he not come to classes any more this session. I am not upset at the coach as I do understand his position. I am very upset that I have not been able to help my son with this.<br/>\nSome days things are great and some days they are not.  He will be great and them he will have moments. I am upset that I know how sweet and wonderful he really is but that on the outside watching  people see his behavior and do not know that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimply put:<br/>\nIt looks bad!<br/>\n <br/>\nHow can I help him with impulse control?  What am I missing?<br/>\n <br/>\nIt is clear he is not ready for it.<br/>\nBut he loves it and wants to do it plus he did great all last year. Shouldn&#39;t it get better with maturity and not worse?<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60171,"nextTopicId":60131}}
