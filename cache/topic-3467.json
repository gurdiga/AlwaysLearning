We both watched slack-jawed as schools of 1,000&#39;s of <br/>\n&gt; sharks descended on unsuspecting prey. We saw a killer whale eat a sea lion <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (Casey told me it was a killer whale, I wasn&#39;t sure). It&#39;s a great show, <br/>\n&gt; just frame after frame of amazing images.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We watched that too!!  It was awesome,,,,although I did get quite<br/>\nannoyed that they would show the different animals breeding and <br/>\nlaying eggs, but NOT show the babies hatching!!  I wanted to see<br/>\nwhat happened next when the babies were born.  Maybe they&#39;ll<br/>\nshow that part later?  Anyway, I guess it&#39;s a series.  We watched <br/>\nthe first part on Sunday and then the second part that they showed <br/>\nright afterwards (and I noticed they did them both all over again two<br/>\nhours later!).  Unfortunately, I missed last night&#39;s episode because <br/>\nI&#39;m such a Roswell junkie, but if there&#39;s another part to the Blue <br/>\nPlanet series tonight, I&#39;ll be sure to tune in!  I&#39;m hoping they will <br/>\nmake it available to borrow from the library eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrea Kim :-)<br/>\nMommy to two sweeties!<br/>\nLaura (2/16/96) & Allison (8/31/99)<br/>\nKent, WA,,,,,,,,soon to be Seattle!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3401,"nextTopicId":3340}}
