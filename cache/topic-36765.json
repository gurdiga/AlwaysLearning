I don&#39;t &quot;unschool&quot; during school hours, instead, unschooling is how we live.  It extends to all aspects of life, from sleep to food to tv to computers to vacations to everything we do, how we do it, choices we make as a family.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome...<br/>\n<br/>\njoylyn<br/>\n---- acja1234 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:acja1234@...\">acja1234@...</a>&gt; wrote: <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; My name is Alba and my husband and I have been exploring homeschool <br/>\n&gt; options for our 4 and 5 year old boys.
