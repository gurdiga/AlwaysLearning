So <br/>\nsome people didn&#39;t like her for being a witch (as it were; not all anglo <br/>\nforms of &#39;witch&#39;) and some thought she was great because she knew herbal <br/>\ncures and midwifery.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, back at UNM, Bernardo hung around our dorm room a lot.  He was pretty <br/>\nfreaked out by being in Albuquerque.  So was I, but Bernardo worse.   <br/>\n<br/>\nOne day after we&#39;d known each other for a few months and he was confiding in <br/>\nme some of the things his radical chicano cohorts had said about Liz, the <br/>\nroommate, he happened to think to ask me what my last name was.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdams.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe looked at me funny and said &quot;What&#39;s your mother&#39;s maiden name?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHathcock.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe just blanched.  &quot;You&#39;re gringa?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI got big eyes, and said &quot;I thought you knew that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;No.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a heck of a moment.  He sat there and thought some palpable, visible <br/>\nthoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was basing his political and social life on some big prejudices, but he <br/>\nhad assumed because I had dark hair and dark eyes and was from Espanola that <br/>\nI was a Trujillo or a Sanchez or something.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWithin a few months I started a years long relationship with Devender Singh, <br/>\nwho was darker than Bernardo, but from New Jersey (and before that, Toronto, <br/>\nBombay, and Delhi).<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of that was unusual for New Mexico, and Jon Tsosie came and visited us <br/>\nall every few weeks, and my former boyfriend Joseph Garcia hung around a fair <br/>\namount too that year.  (Guitar players, Jon and Joseph both &lt;g&gt;.  Dev played <br/>\ntabla; my only drummer ever, but he also played guitar, just not performance <br/>\nquality.  He did get us back stage at the Ravi Shankar concert at Popejoy.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were reading Lord of the Rings in that season.  Dev and I were going to <br/>\nget married, have four children, and name the first boy Peregrine and call <br/>\nhim Pippin.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDev called me last June.  Jon Tsosie died of the effects of alcoholism at 35; <br/>\nI went to his funeral, and he was buried in a blanket outside Santa Clara <br/>\nchurch after a mass at which a Franciscan priest shamed everyone in his <br/>\nfamily for being bad Catholics; Joseph&#39;s living in Southern California, but <br/>\nwe&#39;ve lost contact; I keep thinking Liz or Bernardo will find me someday.  <br/>\nThey&#39;re probably still around close.  She was teaching bi-lingual classes for <br/>\nAlbuquerque public schools last I knew.  Bernardo wanted to become a bank <br/>\nrobber.  I used to listen carefully to every bank robbery story. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99944316,"authorName":"Nancy Wooton","from":"Nancy Wooton &lt;ikonstitcher@...&gt;","profile":"ikonstitcher","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"words was Re: [AlwaysLearning] Bi-racial kids\t(gender-ambiguous-appearing kids)","postDate":"1038240283","msgId":11007,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBMDc4QTFCLjJDOEI5JWlrb25zdGl0Y2hlckBjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFhNS5jODhhNDMyLjJiMTM4OGJhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":11002,"nextInTopic":11009,"prevInTime":11006,"nextInTime":11008,"topicId":10951,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

She<br/>\n&gt; mentioned she was gently teasing her then 15 year old daughter about a <br/>\n&gt; couple<br/>\n&gt; of kids she had met over a weekend, a boy and a girl. She asked about the<br/>\n&gt; boy, &quot;So do you LIKE him?&quot; THEN she asked if she LIKED the girl.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was flabbergasted! ( I just love that word). She had an awareness <br/>\n&gt; that her<br/>\n&gt; daughter just might not be straight, and without even really trying,<br/>\n&gt; communicated to her that it was okay and natural, in the light teasing <br/>\n&gt; way<br/>\n&gt; that parents do with their kids sometimes. (This kid is one who was <br/>\n&gt; fine with<br/>\n&gt; her mom asking about this kind of thing.) Now, most of our kids are <br/>\n&gt; likely to<br/>\n&gt; be straight. BUT even very enlightened parents often talk to their <br/>\n&gt; kids in<br/>\n&gt; ways that would make it hard for a questioning kid to think it was okay.<br/>\n&gt; Kathleen gracefully, in a normal situation, did that (and does <br/>\n&gt; consistently.)<br/>\n&gt; Until she told me that story (and, even more amazingly, it was not to <br/>\n&gt; show<br/>\n&gt; me how enlightenened she was. She was genuinely startled when I <br/>\n&gt; complimented<br/>\n&gt; her on that aspect of it.), it hadn&#39;t occurred to me how much &gt;I&lt; took <br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; granted that Julian would probably be straight.

Read an essay once asking if we <br/>\ncould consider black English a language....hmmmm<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; In Puerto Rico it is really not kosher to call somebody black<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>oh man, did I find out this the hard way. I called a student Black once <br/>\nand she corrected me quite rudely.  I never made that mistake again. <br/>\n This was in the valley of Alb.  By the river, Sandra.  This was the <br/>\nsame class that called me a racist.  The principal was called in, by the <br/>\nkids (middle school).  They said I liked the white kids more than I <br/>\nliked the brown ones. The principal and I looked at the list of kids in <br/>\nthe class and pointed out there were no white kids in the class.  So <br/>\nthey said I liked the light skinned hispanics more than the dark ones.   <br/>\nI asked him to let me handle it in my own way.  The next day my brother <br/>\nJuan happened to come by at that time period, and I introduced him.  Oh <br/>\nby the way class, this is my LITTLE brother.  Juan stands well over 6 <br/>\nfeet, is as wide as a fridge and is dark brown with long black hair.  He <br/>\nis probably half Hispanic/half pueblo but he calls himself an Indian. <br/>\n When we go to pueblos or to Santa fe, people stop him and ask him if <br/>\nthey can take his picture.  I always tell him he should charge money, <br/>\nbut he doesn&#39;t.  He just laughs.  Anyway, he shows up to give me <br/>\nsomething, just by accident, at the same time as this class.  The day <br/>\nafter that my boyfriend, soon to be my husband, stopped by to give me <br/>\nlunch money.  Just by luck, it was during that same class period.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI never heard another word about me liking the light skinned hispanics <br/>\nmore than the dark ones.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; . In the island when talking about someone black, people refer to them <br/>\n&gt; as trigueño or trigueña notwithstanding the fact that the words means <br/>\n&gt; &quot;the color of wheat&quot;. Or, if they want to be poetic, they talk about <br/>\n&gt; somebody&#39;s &quot;piel canela&quot; (cinnamon skin). In NYC the euphemism is <br/>\n&gt; moreno or morena, which literally means &quot;brunette&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>hmm, that&#39;s interesting.  In new mexico a rude term for white person is <br/>\nwetta or jueta.  No one here in California has ever heard that term.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; So to piss people off I started to use the word negra to describe <br/>\n&gt; myself.

He hates African American. <br/>\n He&#39;s never been to Africa he says.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I do not know at what age it started but I distinctly remember <br/>\n&gt; answering to people: &quot;I am black, she&#39;s white AND she is my mother.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I did not have to add anything to add.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Flash forward to more than 20 years.

He has light <br/>\n&gt; brown hair, dark brown eyes and peachy white skin.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My favorite birracial moment was about a year ago, when I was still <br/>\n&gt; nursing Aidan. It was around summer because I was massively tanned. We <br/>\n&gt; were shopping at BJs and he got hungry and cranky. They were selling <br/>\n&gt; lawn chairs, so I sat down to nurse him (there is like nowhere to sit <br/>\n&gt; down at BJs). Boy oh boy oh boy. Earlier Mark had had one of those, <br/>\n&gt; &quot;where&#39;s your family moments&quot; with Evan. Well, there was no asking us <br/>\n&gt; now. Nursing is not so much of an issue here in NYC and environs but a <br/>\n&gt; black woman nursing a white child in public is a whole other thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Or a white woman nursing a black child.  But it was good, it was <br/>\nsomething I could do to proove she was my child.  Why would I need to do <br/>\nthat, i can hear people asking.  Well, for those folks who think I&#39;m <br/>\njust the foster mom.  Read a story about a woman with black kids in the <br/>\nstore.  The toddler got away for a minute, and was picked up by an <br/>\nemployee.  The woman had to prove the child was hers.  What way to do <br/>\nthat?  She didn&#39;t have a picture of her child with her, the child wasn&#39;t <br/>\ntalking a lot yet, what&#39;s a mom to do.  It was one reason, not a big <br/>\none, but one reason why I continued to nurse Lexie.  Another story I <br/>\nheard was a black mom who had a very pale baby.  Baby went to nursery in <br/>\nthe hospital so mom could sleep and the nursing shift changed.  New <br/>\nnurse saw baby wake up and went to take baby to mother but when she saw <br/>\nsleeping mom was black and baby was not, she decided there had been a <br/>\nmix up.  Hours later it was resolved, but meanwhile the mom wasn&#39;t <br/>\nallowed to hold her baby.  This was before all the banding, etc. today <br/>\nbut still.  I kept my babies with me 100% of the time in the hospital, <br/>\njust for this reason.  well, for other reasons too, but for this one as <br/>\nwell.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI love your stories, Liza. Thank you<br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; We definitely had a good laugh.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Then there are the semi-horror stories. One day, one of the kids threw <br/>\n&gt; a tantrum, I can&#39;t remember where. All I know is that he kept saying <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Mommy, mommy&quot; as in &quot;leave me alone I am pissed at you Mommy!&quot; <br/>\n&gt; Because I have been referred to as the nanny more times I want to <br/>\n&gt; count, I can&#39;t tell you how freaked out I was that day. It was like, <br/>\n&gt; oh boy, now people will think that I am abducting my own child. Which <br/>\n&gt; they did.

We","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2946757\">Joylyn,<br/>\n<br/>\nTell Lexie she is not the only one.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids of my mother&#39;s older brother look more like her than my <br/>\nbrother and I ever did when living in PR.  We loved them to pieces <br/>\nbut hated going out with them because people would talk to them and <br/>\nthen turn to my mom and ask if she was babysitting us.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though we are officially &quot;high-yellow&quot;, my brother and I were <br/>\nmore like a mahogany brown when living in the island. All that <br/>\nplaying outdoors gave us wonderfully dark tans. Notwithstanding the <br/>\nfact that my brother has my mother&#39;s smile and I look like the <br/>\nspitting image of her; since she was blonder then and has agathe <br/>\ncolor eyes, people could just not get past the color of our skins.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason why I believe that language is a strong marker of how we <br/>\nperceive others is due to the many ways I had to deal with it growing <br/>\nup.  Since I grew up bilingual, English became the measure for our <br/>\nSpanish&#39;s quirks. I remember asking my parents, why is it that in <br/>\nEnglish you can say &quot;I am black&quot; but in Spanish I never hear people <br/>\nsaying that?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Puerto Rico it is really not kosher to call somebody black. In the <br/>\nisland when talking about someone black, people refer to them as <br/>\ntrigueño or trigueña notwithstanding the fact that the words means <br/>\n&quot;the color of wheat&quot;. Or, if they want to be poetic, they talk about <br/>\nsomebody&#39;s &quot;piel canela&quot; (cinnamon skin). In NYC the euphemism is <br/>\nmoreno or morena, which literally means &quot;brunette&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to piss people off I started to use the word negra to describe <br/>\nmyself. I would piss them off because people with darker skin than <br/>\nmine do not hesitate to call themselves white in PR. I do not know at <br/>\nwhat age it started but I distinctly remember answering to people: &quot;I <br/>\nam black, she&#39;s white AND she is my mother.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI did not have to add anything to add.<br/>\n<br/>\nFlash forward to more than 20 years. Evan looks like a little Ricky <br/>\nMartín. Aidan, on the other hand, is not dark AT ALL. He has light <br/>\nbrown hair, dark brown eyes and peachy white skin.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy favorite birracial moment was about a year ago, when I was still <br/>\nnursing Aidan. It was around summer because I was massively tanned. <br/>\nWe were shopping at BJs and he got hungry and cranky. They were <br/>\nselling lawn chairs, so I sat down to nurse him (there is like <br/>\nnowhere to sit down at BJs). Boy oh boy oh boy. Earlier Mark had had <br/>\none of those, &quot;where&#39;s your family moments&quot; with Evan. Well, there <br/>\nwas no asking us now. Nursing is not so much of an issue here in NYC <br/>\nand environs but a black woman nursing a white child in public is a <br/>\nwhole other thing. We definitely had a good laugh.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there are the semi-horror stories. One day, one of the kids <br/>\nthrew a tantrum, I can&#39;t remember where. All I know is that he kept <br/>\nsaying &quot;Mommy, mommy&quot; as in &quot;leave me alone I am pissed at you <br/>\nMommy!&quot; Because I have been referred to as the nanny more times I <br/>\nwant to count, I can&#39;t tell you how freaked out I was that day. It <br/>\nwas like, oh boy, now people will think that I am abducting my own <br/>\nchild. Which they did. If it had not been for Mark, who was in <br/>\nanother part of the store or whatever the place it was, I would have <br/>\nhad to go to the police! Can you believe that %$#@! And of course, NO <br/>\nONE APOLOGIZED.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, why do I love NYC? It is the by and far the biracial capital <br/>\nof the world.

She wanted <br/>\nany books we had on Mother Goose stories with pictures, as that was her <br/>\ntheme.  I asked Lexie to go look for all Mother goose type books she had <br/>\nand she, of course, asked why.  I told her and she wanted to know if we <br/>\nwere invited to the party.  I said that no, we were not. Well, why not, <br/>\nshe asked. I explained that I was sure there were many reasons and that <br/>\nnot everyone could be invited to every party.  She reminded me that I&#39;ve <br/>\ntold her not to discuss her birthday parties around those that were not <br/>\ninvited and that Rita was very rude to not only tell us about a party to <br/>\nwhich we were not invited, but that she was asking our help in the <br/>\nplanning of the party by asking for books.  I then said that while that <br/>\nwas true, I knew that Rita knew I was mature enough to handle the <br/>\nsituation and that I also was pretty sure that children were not <br/>\ninvited.  I was kinda hemming and hawing.  Lexie replied by telling me <br/>\nthat she was very mature for her age and that she could behave like an <br/>\nadult.  I said I was also sure that the party started very late, too <br/>\nlate for kids.  She said she stays up late each night (she does, that is <br/>\ntrue).  I finally said that the primary reason was because the party was <br/>\nfor lesbians, the one night a year Rita had an all girls party.  This <br/>\ntook the cake for Lexie.  She said that she had already told me she was <br/>\ngoing to be bisexual and that she might only be a lesbian and that she <br/>\nneeded to have lots of experiences with lots of different people and <br/>\nwhat better way to learn about lesbians and bisexuals then going to a <br/>\nparty with them.  Lexie has said for the last few years that she is <br/>\ngoing to marry two boys and one girl to have four adults in the family <br/>\nso that her kids will always have at least one dad and one mom home with <br/>\nwith them at any given time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told Rita this and I know she told her friends because we went to <br/>\ntheir fourth of July party at the Hollywood Bowl.  They buy a block of <br/>\ntickets way in the back, hang Rainbow Coalition flags and USA flags, <br/>\nhave a huge pot luck, etc.  They all teased us and said we were the <br/>\ntoken gay couple.  But everyone who met Lexie would say to us, looking <br/>\nat Rita knowingly, oh this is Lexie. Rita thinks Lexie is the best kid <br/>\non earth...<br/>\n<br/>\njoylyn   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi Wordhouse-Dykema wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ...which reminds me of something that happened with my teenage daughter.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; She was having a (male) homeschooling friend from another city over to <br/>\n&gt; stay<br/>\n&gt; for a few days and she was trying to plan out where he was going to<br/>\n&gt; sleep.

He also had a strong male role <br/>\nmodel who had long braided hair so maybe that&#39;s why.  He also doesn&#39;t like <br/>\na lot of change which probably played a role.<br/>\n<br/>\nI took the comments about his beauty with a sense of humor (and excepting <br/>\nfor the gender, they were right on about the beauty!) because their <br/>\nmisconception led them to treat him in a much gentler, more humane way than <br/>\nthey would have, had they known he was male from the get-go.  Lots of sweet <br/>\nvoices and compliments that other little boys around us weren&#39;t getting.  I <br/>\nthink part of his gentleness today is from the caring complete strangers <br/>\nshowed him.  Thinking he was a girl, they didn&#39;t expect him to be rough and <br/>\ntough, so he never figured out that maybe his gender was supposed to be <br/>\nthat way.  Sure, there&#39;s probably more to it than just hair, but if those <br/>\nof you with lil&#39; boys with long hair want to run an experiment, continue to <br/>\nnot cut his hair (provided that&#39;s okay with the child) and see if folks <br/>\ntreat your son more gently and considerately than they do the boys with <br/>\nshort hair.<br/>\n<br/>\n(and I&#39;d suggest letting the gender comments roll away harmlessly unless <br/>\nthe child is annoyed by them.

Years ago, Santa Fe built <br/>\nthis area up for the railroad workers. Many houses are built from old box <br/>\ncars! Anyway, the people in our neighborhood are mostly Mexican American, <br/>\nsome White (those who are white are of Russian, German, or Swedish descent, <br/>\none area is called *Little Russia*) some Black, some Native American, mostly <br/>\na mix of everything. Our area is so diverse and beautiful, everything here is <br/>\nso unlike the rest of the town where white and black people only live in this <br/>\narea or that area. And everything still has a segregated feeling about it, <br/>\neven though most will deny it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are fascinated with their heritage, Most of my family is Swedish, <br/>\nDarin is Cherokee and Delaware. I used to have blonde hair (I dye it red) and <br/>\nI have green eyes and pale skin, Darin has black hair, beautiful deep blue <br/>\n*Cherokee* eyes, and creamy olive skin. My kids will probably have black hair <br/>\nby the time they are older, right now Jack&#39;s is a weird shade of silvery <br/>\nblonde highlights on top of light brown hair and Moly&#39;s is golden brown, they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t get Darin&#39;s blue eyes, they got my olive green eyes.

That doesn&#39;t bother me but lately I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen getting incredibly rude comments about what I *need* to do with his<br/>\nhair. If he or I correct them and say he&#39;s a boy they come back with<br/>\ncomments like, &quot;He needs a haircut&quot; to which I respond, &quot;He just had one.&quot;<br/>\nBut the other day this moron says to me, &quot;You need to move that boy&#39;s head<br/>\ncloser to the clippers!&quot; I about went ballistic. I told him he needed to<br/>\nmind his own damn business. Truth be told, it wouldn&#39;t bother me if it<br/>\nweren&#39;t said right in front of Skylar like he didn&#39;t exist. The child has<br/>\nears and understands exactly what they are saying.<br/>\n<br/>\nWendy<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: Heidi Wordhouse-Dykema [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:heidi@...\">heidi@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, November 23, 2002 4:33 PM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Bi-racial kids (gender-ambiguous-appearing<br/>\nkids)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  You think having bi-kids is cute?

They *are* cuter!!!  ;)  Ok I may be partial since mine are <br/>\nhalf white and half Korean but they are cuter :).  And I&#39;m sure some <br/>\npeople get turned off by me, the gushing white girl.  Especially in <br/>\nthe grocery store or sompleace when I don&#39;t have my own kids with <br/>\nme.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd people tell me all the time how adorable my kids are.  And I just <br/>\nhave to agree with them.  The thought that they might be faking it or <br/>\ntrying to prove something to themselves didn&#39;t occure to me until I <br/>\nwas on a list talking to another mother with biracial children.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what is a poor uncultured white girl to do?  I&#39;ve never been the <br/>\nvictim of out and out racial predjudice before (at least to my <br/>\nknowledge) and neither have my children really.  My husband has <br/>\nextensivley but it&#39;s still not something I understand.  I find myself <br/>\nnow *so* sensitive to the subtile things people say that I often <br/>\ndon&#39;t say anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI always wish I could wear a t-shirt that would explain it all.  Then <br/>\nI have to ask myself what am I trying to prove?  Maybe I am the <br/>\nobnoxious white girl who&#39;s trying to prove she&#39;s not racist to <br/>\nherself.  I know I have some racist hangups.  I know this.  I wish I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what is the best way?  From people who have biracial families or <br/>\npeople who are in same sex relationships.  What is the best way for <br/>\nme to let you know that I think wht you&#39;re doing is great.  And I <br/>\nwish it wasn&#39;t such a big deal and I hope some day we won&#39;t even have <br/>\nto think twice about it?<br/>\n<br/>\nKatie<br/>\n<br/>\nPS.  Where I live biracial families in my age group are almost the <br/>\nnorm.  At least it seems that way.  And almost all of my closest <br/>\nfriends are in biracial marriages.
