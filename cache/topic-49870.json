In previous<br/>\ngenerations things kept getting reused.  Clothes became patchwork quilts,<br/>\nrugs or rags if they were too far gone.  Now people buy painting rags,<br/>\ninstead of cutting up ripped/dirty old clothes.<br/>\n<br/>\nFood issues have always existed with food going in and out of &quot;style&quot; during<br/>\nmy childhood.  Earlier generations didn&#39;t have that luxury and I suspect<br/>\nneither will our grandchildren, because we have created a car dependent<br/>\nsociety and when gas stops coming out in huge quantities there will be less<br/>\ncheap exotic grains, products and those eschewing native grains for teff<br/>\ngrown far away will suddenly find restrictions due to cash, unless we figure<br/>\nout a way to keep the imports coming in cheaply.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarina<br/>\n<br/>\n2010/1/21 Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Earlier today Holly was looking at a photo of Ren Allen and her<br/>\n&gt; sister, Heidi, years ago, with &#39;80&#39;s hair.
