She asked me what my wishes would be if I could <br/>\nhave three wishes, and she said it couldn&#39;t be anything like world peace or <br/>\nthat the women in Iraq could wear whatever they wanted to.  It had to be <br/>\nselfish.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I came up with three pretty mundane grown-up wishes about the house being <br/>\npaid off, and enough money to maintain it without Keith working, and a new <br/>\nvan.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoring.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly&#39;s were this:<br/>\n<br/>\nInvisible eyelids so she could see with her eyes closed.  I told her some <br/>\nsnakes and I thought maybe some lizards had that.  She was happy to hear <br/>\nthat, and hadn&#39;t known.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second wish was to know whether we live other lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird wish was dependent on the second.  If the answer was yes, she wanted to <br/>\nremember past lives.  If the answer was no, she wanted a thousand dollars. <br/>\n<br/>\nI thought it was way more thoughtful and creative than I would have wished at <br/>\neleven.
