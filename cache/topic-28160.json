She also likes carving into pillar <br/>\ncandles. She puts them out with a snuffer, blowing or putting a small plate <br/>\nover the flame and then I light it again for her using a good sized butane <br/>\nsafety lighter - the wand kind that is designed for barbeques. We also have <br/>\na very cool  hinged one that can be bent over to light candles at the bottom <br/>\nof a container without burning one&#39;s hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I do is ensure that the candle is on a safe and solid surface, and one <br/>\nthat would be undamaged by the few wax drips. Jayn is interested in the <br/>\neffect of thick wax on fabric. If Jayn is going overboard, IMO, with the <br/>\nnumber of toothpicks I warn her that she is likely to melt the side of the <br/>\ncandle. Periodically during the game I clean out the black charcoal bits - <br/>\nanother tool for art work.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince our lighters are too difficult for her work yet, she still needs me to <br/>\ndo the lighting for her. That very simple method ensures that I am around <br/>\nfor all of this play. I have also told her I prefer to be there and so far <br/>\nshe hasn&#39;t objected. Actually she wants me there to be an audience for her <br/>\nnarrative about the game. I stay near sitting at the table with my computer <br/>\nbut don&#39;t &quot;hover&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsually she doesn&#39;t think of doing it unless I have lit a candle for another <br/>\nreason such as the table centerpiece. Jayn likes to decorate the dinner <br/>\ntable by theme, and these have been great occasions to talk about <br/>\nflammability and why we should not have the Barbie sleeve or the floral <br/>\nblooms hanging over the flame.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do have matches in the house too. Jayn has asked to light her own matches <br/>\nat times, and what I did was ask her to do it in the bathroom where all the <br/>\nsurfaces are hard.  She knows how to do it properly away from her but I <br/>\nthink having to do that herself was too much trouble because she swiftly <br/>\nwent back to asking me to light her candles for her. She has also dripped <br/>\nwax from tapers and used a burning candle to light incense sticks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have ceased feeling the need to be present while she plays with her <br/>\nincense sticks, partly because being too close to the smoke makes my eyes <br/>\nsore. They tend to go out pretty quickly if she is waving them about and <br/>\nmaking smoke patterns. She has used them to burn holes and lines in paper <br/>\nfor art work. Again this is something I ask her to do in the relative safety <br/>\nof the bathroom just down the hall. The sticks we have just don&#39;t seem to <br/>\nhave the oomph to actually do more than make the paper smoulder and she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t leave it unattended. So far she has informed me when she wants to <br/>\nplay (I light her candle) and then tells me when she is done and I attend to <br/>\ntrimming the candle wick if needed and put it away.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe recently experimented with pieces of wire held to the flame by a damp <br/>\npaper towel. Insulation.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn at 3 was very slightly burnt by a birthday cake candle. It was so <br/>\nslight that she didn&#39;t even tell me about it, but just was wary around cakes <br/>\nfor a while. I didn&#39;t see it happen, but my friend on the other side of the <br/>\ntable did see it and finally told me about a year later when I mentioned <br/>\nthat Jayn didn&#39;t like candles - &quot;Oh it&#39;s because she was burnt&quot;. HUh??? Oh <br/>\nwell she got over it, and there was no visible burn so I think she might <br/>\njust have felt the heat rather than actually gotten in to the flame. We just <br/>\nsupported her preference not to have candles on her cakes for a year or two <br/>\nand the fear faded.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a lovely moment in &quot;Kiki&#39;s Delivery Service&quot; when Kiki (13) builds <br/>\nand lights the fire in the wall oven at the old lady&#39;s house.

You are quite a  <br/>\nchallenge sometimes.   In a medium like this it is very hard to  <br/>\nexpress everything the way I could in a RL situation.  But here in  <br/>\nflat black and white emails that cannot always be.  I am far from  <br/>\nbeing the &quot;unschooling mom of the year&quot;, but, as I have stated before  <br/>\nI am re-connecting and through this group and much of your writings  <br/>\nand Joyce&#39;s as well, I am making progress.  Sometimes when you are in  <br/>\nthe process, questions come up as to how to handle specific  <br/>\nsituations.  In my current evolution I am afraid of my kids playing  <br/>\nwith lighters and lighting candles when I&#39;m not around.  Part of  <br/>\nprogressing is also being honest with what your feeling.   Based on  <br/>\nthis fear (them getting burned), and knowing that Athena still feels  <br/>\nthe need (I agree that &quot;the type&quot;is a not cool way to talk about my  <br/>\nchild and I thank you for that &quot;heads up&quot; ) to sneak behind my back  <br/>\n(another behavior that is quickly disappearing) I came to this group  <br/>\nto ask some basic questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was looking for unschooling in action, so to speak, and ideas about  <br/>\nhow other unschooling parents have handled the fire thing.  Is there  <br/>\na boundary line?  She (Athena) is also very independent and wants to  <br/>\ndo/try things without me around.  She is already very comfortable  <br/>\nwith fire and lighting candles and helping with the wood stove and  <br/>\nroasting sausages on our open fire pit outside.  When I talk about  <br/>\nsafety, and distance, and flammable etc she says she already knows.   <br/>\nWhen they were 5 we were outside lighting small grass fires and  <br/>\nputting them out with blankets, water and smothering them with dirt  <br/>\nand I let them use the small fire extinguisher.  So in a very real  <br/>\nsense they do understand about fire.  I am looking for approaches  <br/>\nthat work.  I understand the concepts  but still have a hard time  <br/>\nimplementing them in certain areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wasn&#39;t asking for your approval.  Again, looking for ideas and  <br/>\nsuggestion.  It is true that as I re-learn and re-connect I analyze  <br/>\nand think more about how to react to something, trying to see if it  <br/>\nis knee-jerk or calculated, or if there is manipulation behind what I  <br/>\nwant to say, or coerciveness or guilt.  These are often hard to  <br/>\nrecognize, and since fire is a safety issue I want to make the best  <br/>\ndecision possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as dripping wax everywhere... Obviously you haven&#39;t seen my  <br/>\nhouse and how very lax I am about things like that.  I do not live in  <br/>\nor keep one of those neat and tidy homes nor do I have furniture I  <br/>\ncare about.  My apologies for not clarifying that I meant&quot;dripping  <br/>\nwax everywhere&quot; as a fun thing to do... not necessarily all over the  <br/>\nfurniture, but onto plates and trays and into water (great idea).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have strong convictions based on real life experience.  People  <br/>\nwith strong convictions can come off as being hard.  I don&#39;t mind  <br/>\nbeing the learner here.  At first glance your email came off as  <br/>\nunnecessarily harsh.  Perhaps it is, perhaps not.  It doesn&#39;t really  <br/>\nmatter.  Personally I was never very good at diplomacy and much  <br/>\nprefer someone&#39;s true thoughts unpampered and not sugar-coated, as  <br/>\nyours are.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour second reply was more along the lines of what  I was looking for  <br/>\nand I will re-read your balance article.
