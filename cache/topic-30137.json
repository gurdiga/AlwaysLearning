The principles<br/>\nof trust and respect can (and should)exist within a daycare situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think its a bit simplistic to assume that unschooling can always be<br/>\nan ideal situation. I think each of us makes our real life challenges<br/>\nas ideal as possible.

Yet it does here....and quite well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hear people talking about how mother&#39;s are selfish/horrible<br/>\netc...for working full-time rather than being home with their kids.<br/>\nThat is overgeneralizing just as the above statement is. Sure, it&#39;s<br/>\nideal to have a parent home full-time...definitely. But people without<br/>\nideal situations CAN make unschooling work beautifully.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know some single Moms that ran from bad home situations.

Two of them I know personally, really WANTED an<br/>\nunschooling situation but needed daycare in order to EAT and have<br/>\nhousing!  They would have been thrilled to find someone who understood<br/>\nthe principles of unschooling to care for their children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the unschooling philosophy can be expanded to include those in<br/>\nless-than-ideal situations. I think the world in general, needs to get<br/>\nto a place of more respect to children. Why can&#39;t unschooling<br/>\nphilosophy be compatible with daycare? I&#39;m really curious why you<br/>\nthink that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I don&#39;t go out and advocate both parents working full-time, or<br/>\nputting your child in daycare, there ARE situations where unschooling<br/>\nfamilies might need to do those things.

But I <br/>\nespecially like her ideas for fun group things to do to allow young <br/>\nchildren to explore and be creative.  If I had to send my kids to an <br/>\ninstitution (or be in one myself), I&#39;d want something like what she has.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe says things like (paraphrasing), &quot;It is not my job to get kids <br/>\nready for kindergarden.  It is my job to meet them where they are and <br/>\ndo with them what&#39;s developmentally appropriate for them now.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy favorite story I ever heard her tell is this (again paraphrasing):<br/>\nA boy came to school one day and said, &quot;Teacher Bev, I need some <br/>\nlettuce.&quot;  I didn&#39;t ask why or what for; I said, &quot;What kind of <br/>\nlettuce?&quot;  The boy said, &quot;One of those big round ones.&quot;  I grabbed a <br/>\ndad who was leaving after dropping off his child and asked him to go <br/>\nto the store and get me a head of iceberg lettuce.  When he came back <br/>\nwith the lettuce, the boy said, &quot;Now I need some milk and a big <br/>\nbowl,&quot; so I got him those.  Then he said, &quot;Now we need to put it in <br/>\nthe microwave.&quot;  I said, &quot;How long?&quot;  He told me three minutes.  When <br/>\nit came out of the microwave, he stirred it a little then said it was done.&quot;<br/>\nSome things that really strike me about that story:<br/>\n<br/>\n    * It&#39;s exactly what you&#39;d usually do with your own unschooled <br/>\nchild.  Although, depending on the circumstances, you might converse more.<br/>\n    * I love that she grabbed the dad, whom I picture as being a <br/>\nhurried businessman in a suit and tie and just assumed that this <br/>\nboy&#39;s requests were as important as anything the dad may have to do.<br/>\n    * I can&#39;t believe this happens very often in a group setting or <br/>\nif it does, she must have TONS of help.  I know a homeschooling <br/>\nfamily whose kid went there and the mom told me that volunteering <br/>\nthere was hard work with lots of cleanup!<br/>\nAnother thing I remember her telling about was buying a 50 pound sack <br/>\nof flour and letting the kids do what they wanted.  We did that for <br/>\nNicky&#39;s 3rd birthday party.  He was getting over chickenpox and I <br/>\nhave a picture of him naked with all his little pox marks covered <br/>\nwith flour.  It was outside, of course, very fun for the kids and <br/>\nreally didn&#39;t take any clean up at all (since it was in a bare dirt <br/>\narea of the yard).<br/>\n<br/>\nPam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: unschooling and daycare","postDate":"1186067190","msgId":30169,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhCQ0IxMDEwLTU1QzMtNDQ2My04MjZCLUQ0QkFDMzA2QzI4OUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHQUVERUtBQUIuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHQUVERUtBQUIuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":30168,"nextInTopic":30171,"prevInTime":30168,"nextInTime":30170,"topicId":30137,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Choice of words may seem like a minor thing, especially when we are well-intended, but if we are really serious about unschooling and making our ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2038924360\">-=-Choice of words may seem like a minor thing, especially when we are<br/>\nwell-intended, but if we are really serious about unschooling and  <br/>\nmaking our<br/>\nrelationships the best they can be with our kids, then it is pretty darn<br/>\nimportant.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in the case where someone has just explained to us that it  <br/>\nwould&#39;ve been different if the child had said &quot;Please help me get a  <br/>\ndrink&quot; instead of &quot;I&#39;m thirsty,&quot; it seems even MORE important that  <br/>\nthe person be willing to accept that her own word choices are important.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":49413852,"authorName":"Dawn","from":"&quot;Dawn&quot; &lt;dawn@...&gt;","profile":"astrologerdawn","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: unschooling and daycare","postDate":"1186066990","msgId":30168,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY4c3JuZStzZDRnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDcwODAxMTk0NjAwLjExODA4LnFtYWlsQHNlcnZlcjMxNi5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":30167,"nextInTopic":30169,"prevInTime":30167,"nextInTime":30169,"topicId":30137,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"UNSCHOOLING AND DAYCARE (and yes I m shouting) TOGETHER ARE AN OXYMORON...

Has<br/>\n anyone<br/>\n ever done that with a large group of kids?&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\n Years ago, before hearing the word &quot;unschool&quot;, I ran a preschool. It was<br/>\n based on Sudbury Valley School, which I highly recommend you look into<br/>\n for<br/>\n your situation (not that I think it is an ideal situation, but appears to<br/>\n be<br/>\n the kind of thing you are looking for). Free, open concept, kids making<br/>\n their own decisions while living within rules created by them and the<br/>\n teachers.<br/>\n <br/>\n It was messy, fun, engaging, stimulating, and probably the best child<br/>\n care<br/>\n type of situation anywhere around there at the time.<br/>\n <br/>\n It was exhausting for me. Allowing children to be free, and being their<br/>\n partner in their individual journeys, was just downright exhausting. I<br/>\n had<br/>\n 21 children and one other adult with me.<br/>\n <br/>\n Now let&#39;s talk about my kids. They were, for much of the time, ignored by<br/>\n me. I didn&#39;t mean to ignore them, but they could see how busy I was, and<br/>\n how<br/>\n tired this job made me. They usually did not come to me for extra<br/>\n attention<br/>\n or to seek things. At the time in my fogged understanding (which felt<br/>\n quite<br/>\n clear at the time) I believed that they were simply really content. I<br/>\n really<br/>\n wouldn&#39;t have known for sure though, because I was so busy and engaged<br/>\n with<br/>\n so many kids.<br/>\n <br/>\n And I had principled ethics about the situation...these parents were<br/>\n paying<br/>\n money and I owed it to them and their children to make sure the kids&#39;<br/>\n needs<br/>\n and wants were met. So I often chose to fulfill those needs over checking<br/>\n in<br/>\n with my kids, at least during &quot;school hours&quot;. I would be the best mom in<br/>\n the<br/>\n world after that, and I do believe that was somewhat helpful. But while<br/>\n other kids were with us, which was for about 8 hours a day, 5 days a<br/>\n week, I<br/>\n did not give them as much attention as they needed. They really did need<br/>\n me<br/>\n to check in with them, as they were not going to add to what they could<br/>\n see<br/>\n I was already so involved in. Squeeze their unbelievable empathic hearts.<br/>\n <br/>\n And I STILL feel guilty about that.<br/>\n <br/>\n So that is my experience. I got out of it pretty quickly, thankfully, and<br/>\n began to really know my children again. That was about 10 years ago.<br/>\n Today<br/>\n they are 13, 15, 17 and 18 and boy are we in a different place today than<br/>\n we<br/>\n would have been if I continued on that course.<br/>\n <br/>\n Jacki</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":82889211,"authorName":"Emily Troper","from":"Emily Troper &lt;emtroper@...&gt;","profile":"emtroper2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: unschooling and daycare","postDate":"1186038123","msgId":30164,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFFMTJGMzJDLTAyMTgtNDA2Qy05NkQwLUJGOEZDRTRBMTZBM0BlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":30163,"nextInTopic":30167,"prevInTime":30163,"nextInTime":30165,"topicId":30137,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... individuals and have choices in what they do and how they do it.

Has anyone<br/>\never done that with a large group of kids?&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYears ago, before hearing the word &quot;unschool&quot;, I ran a preschool. It was<br/>\nbased on Sudbury Valley School, which I highly recommend you look into for<br/>\nyour situation (not that I think it is an ideal situation, but appears to be<br/>\nthe kind of thing you are looking for). Free, open concept, kids making<br/>\ntheir own decisions while living within rules created by them and the<br/>\nteachers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was messy, fun, engaging, stimulating, and probably the best child care<br/>\ntype of situation anywhere around there at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was exhausting for me. Allowing children to be free, and being their<br/>\npartner in their individual journeys, was just downright exhausting. I had<br/>\n21 children and one other adult with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow let&#39;s talk about my kids. They were, for much of the time, ignored by<br/>\nme. I didn&#39;t mean to ignore them, but they could see how busy I was, and how<br/>\ntired this job made me. They usually did not come to me for extra attention<br/>\nor to seek things. At the time in my fogged understanding (which felt quite<br/>\nclear at the time) I believed that they were simply really content. I really<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have known for sure though, because I was so busy and engaged with<br/>\nso many kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I had principled ethics about the situation...these parents were paying<br/>\nmoney and I owed it to them and their children to make sure the kids&#39; needs<br/>\nand wants were met. So I often chose to fulfill those needs over checking in<br/>\nwith my kids, at least during &quot;school hours&quot;. I would be the best mom in the<br/>\nworld after that, and I do believe that was somewhat helpful. But while<br/>\nother kids were with us, which was for about 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, I<br/>\ndid not give them as much attention as they needed. They really did need me<br/>\nto check in with them, as they were not going to add to what they could see<br/>\nI was already so involved in. Squeeze their unbelievable empathic hearts.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I STILL feel guilty about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that is my experience. I got out of it pretty quickly, thankfully, and<br/>\nbegan to really know my children again. That was about 10 years ago. Today<br/>\nthey are 13, 15, 17 and 18 and boy are we in a different place today than we<br/>\nwould have been if I continued on that course.<br/>\n<br/>\nJacki</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: unschooling and daycare","postDate":"1186023935","msgId":30160,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZBMTBCQTYwLTQ3OUUtNDE0Mi1BNTQxLTI5OTY3QTBBNjczQkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDcwODAyMDE0NzMyLjMxMDQucW1haWxAc2VydmVyMzE2LmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDcwODAyMDE0NzMyLjMxMDQucW1haWxAc2VydmVyMzE2LmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":30158,"nextInTopic":30162,"prevInTime":30158,"nextInTime":30162,"topicId":30137,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I also agree that kids don t need to be taught independence, (I said that not knowing how carefully I had to word things on this list)-=- To suggest that","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1660735080\">-=-I also agree that kids don&#39;t need to be taught independence, (I  <br/>\nsaid that not knowing how carefully I had to word things on this  <br/>\nlist)-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nTo suggest that you this lists requires you to be more careful with  <br/>\nwords and thoughts than other places in your world says something.   <br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t say anything about this list, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nCareful thought should be for all occasions.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-O I&#39;m sorry if I sound like I&#39;m not listening to you philosopy on  <br/>\nunschooling,or wording thing correctly, but I feel like your not  <br/>\ntrying to give me any helpful advice, your just trying to convince me  <br/>\nthat I&#39;m not truley unschooling.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way to do things in an unschooling way is to become an unschooler  <br/>\nto the point that you don&#39;t think any other way.

Lots of times kids don&#39;t stop and think things through.  If I ask them and they say they don&#39;t know then we talk about what options they have such as asking me or someone else to get them something or getting it themselves, or waiting until lunch or snack time.  If if was a new kid that was not used to doing things for themselves then of course I would tell them that it is okay for them to just get a drink and they don&#39;t have to ask permission and if they want me to do it for them, I would.And I would make sure they knew how to do it.  Once the kids are comfortable here, they have no problem helping themselves.  Once they know that they don&#39;t need permission to get a drink or go to the bathroom they do fine doing in on their own.

That would be the paramount <br/>\nquestion really.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have on occasion watched other people&#39;s children, either for money <br/>\nor just because I&#39;m nice and I like the kids and the parents of the <br/>\nkids.  I&#39;ve done it on a regular basis before, and even under the <br/>\nbest circumstances, dealing with another person&#39;s child isn&#39;t the <br/>\nsame as just interacting with your own children.  There were days <br/>\nwhen my kids didn&#39;t want other kids around, they wanted their space <br/>\nto be theirs.  They didn&#39;t want to share their toys and get along, <br/>\nand if someone is counting on me for child care, I couldn&#39;t give that <br/>\nto them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems that it would be a big deal to have a lot of kids over all <br/>\nthe time, it interferes with family life and family dynamics.  <br/>\nPerhaps your family doesn&#39;t have these issues, but I don&#39;t see how <br/>\nthat&#39;s possible if you have kids over 7 days a week.  I can&#39;t tell <br/>\nyou how to run your business, but why not make it 5 days a week <br/>\nduring regular business hours, or make yourself an off hour daycare <br/>\nand don&#39;t accept kids during regular business hours and only off <br/>\nhours for those that need it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand the draw of running a daycare for income, as you can do <br/>\nit at home along side your kids and have playmates for them.  I just <br/>\nreally don&#39;t see how you can give your own kids the time they need to <br/>\nunschool and take care of so many kids.  Much of dealing with large <br/>\namounts of kids has to do with order and control.  Even in a free <br/>\nschool environment there is some amount of order and control, and the <br/>\nkids are mostly older than what you are dealing with.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a while I tried starting a school that was intended for <br/>\nhomeschoolers, to offer some cool classes and whatnot.  Ultimately <br/>\nwhat it came down to, was that it wasn&#39;t conducive to unschooling for <br/>\nmy own child. (My youngest was a baby)  It was fun, yet, when my <br/>\ndaughter didn&#39;t want to go, she still had to since I had to.  It <br/>\nlasted about 9 mos.  It was an interesting experiment and we got a <br/>\nlot out of it, but in the end, it was difficult to do that part time <br/>\nand unschool.  <br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately it comes down to how dedicated you are to unschooling your <br/>\nown kids.  If that is what you truly want, taking a look at the whole <br/>\ndaycare stuff is warranted.  You can make your daycare as unschooly <br/>\nas possible, but it still may not work along side unschooling your <br/>\nown kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when you ask if there have been others doing what you are doing, I <br/>\nwould say that I&#39;ve tried to do similar things, but ended up stopping <br/>\nbecause it truly wasn&#39;t condusive to unschooling my own kids and that <br/>\nwas far more important than the little bit of extra money I got.  If <br/>\nthere are others more successful than I was, I don&#39;t know.  My <br/>\nexperience says it can&#39;t be done, and I&#39;m a pretty &quot;can do&quot; sort of <br/>\nperson.  I say this because I&#39;ve found that to truly unschool your <br/>\nkids, you have to give them &quot;you&quot;.  It is a very important part of <br/>\nunschooling, to be present and there for your kids when they need <br/>\nyou.  I just don&#39;t see how one can do that and be a caregiver to 15 <br/>\nother children, without your own kids getting the short end of the <br/>\nstick so to speak.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: unschooling and daycare","postDate":"1186013209","msgId":30156,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY4cjc2cCtkdWcxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDcwODAxMjI0NTI4LjIzMjg2LnFtYWlsQHNlcnZlcjMxNi5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":30155,"nextInTopic":30157,"prevInTime":30155,"nextInTime":30157,"topicId":30137,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~  What I am looking for may not be unschooling by your definition, I want a relaxed fun atmosphere where children are treated as individuals and have choices","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-552319652\">~~  What I am looking for may not be unschooling by your definition, I<br/>\nwant a relaxed fun atmosphere where children are treated as<br/>\nindividuals and have choices in what they do and how they do it.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps not.<br/>\nOne of the first suggestions was about your answer to the child that<br/>\nsays &quot;I&#39;m thirsty&quot;.

If you are<br/>\nreally wanting to give your own children a rich unschooling life, is there a<br/>\nway you can reduce the kids in your home? Or the time you have them (18<br/>\nhours a day 7 days a week? Jiminy Cricket!). I have four kids who are all<br/>\nteenagers now and I don&#39;t feel like I gave them all that was best for them<br/>\nwhen they were little simply because I was trying to do it by myself, and<br/>\nthere were only four.

If you were to think of just your family first,<br/>\nand what they want and need (time, individual attention, support, a parent<br/>\nwho thinks of extra things for them when they don&#39;t even ask, a rested<br/>\nparent without stress), and then try to build an income around that, I think<br/>\nyou could make a great unschooling environment. Maybe it means giving up<br/>\nluxuries, or downsizing the house, or buying store-brand food, but so what.<br/>\nWe&#39;ve downsized big-time in the past to accommodate our lifestyle.
