I was reading it to<br/>\nhim because it was written in long hand, cursive, and my son doesn&#39;t know<br/>\nhow to read it or write it. Later when we were talking about the makeup of<br/>\nhis 1750 point Warhammer 40k army and I was looking at his draftsman like<br/>\nprinting of his list, I panicked. Those ugly fears that --I know how to do<br/>\nsomething that he doesn&#39;t --grabbed me and I asked him if he was interested<br/>\nin learning how to read or write cursive.  He said &quot;yeah that would be<br/>\ninteresting, but not now.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I started thinking...<br/>\n<br/>\nIs cursive obsolete?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t use it. My written communication with him [and everyone else] is<br/>\neither typed on the computer or handwritten printing, the way I prefer to<br/>\nwrite. The only place my son runs across cursive is in letters from his aunt<br/>\nand uncle.  His reading is almost exclusively printed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs a person considered illiterate if they can&#39;t read cursive?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow would an unschooler ever get the desire to learn it if they never run<br/>\nacross it?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe didn&#39;t have much to do with his learning handwritten printing.  I now<br/>\nmarvel at how he forms letters, mostly starting at their bottoms. Nothing<br/>\nlike the uniform way the public school taught me. He prefers unlined paper.<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what he would use as a model if he did have a desire.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone here have experience with this?   It seems like something a<br/>\nperson could easily pick up if there was a need.  But what if that need<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t arrive until some vitally urgent bit of information needs to be<br/>\nunderstood with no time for the learning?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo is cursive obsolete?  Did any of your kids learn cursive?  How?  Why?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Dan Vilter</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1447,"nextTopicId":1460}}
