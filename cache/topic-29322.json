In some<br/>\nstates &quot;homeschooling&quot; is an acceptable word, other states may not be<br/>\nas tolerant, depending on what educational avenues they expect<br/>\nfamilies to follow (like umbrella schools, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The magazine article went beyond even that, and said that unschooling<br/>\n&gt; was legal. It is pretty clear that the authorities, from school<br/>\n&gt; district officials on up to state legislators, didn&#39;t intend to<br/>\n&gt; legalize unschooling, and that we&#39;re pretty much all taking advantage<br/>\n&gt; of the fact that they don&#39;t even really understand what we&#39;re doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t read the magazine article, so I wasn&#39;t speaking to that, but<br/>\nI can guess where they got the information ~ probably misuse of words<br/>\nand an implied understanding on the part of the speaker that might or<br/>\nmight not actually have been understood correctly by the receiver. In<br/>\nother words, just like what I did with my post - Oops!  I guess coming<br/>\nfrom a place where homeschooling and even unschooling is not<br/>\ndifficult, I forget the difficulties others face elsewhere. It wasn&#39;t<br/>\nmy intention to exacerbate the problem - I will be more careful in the<br/>\nfuture.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There is language in most, not quite all, homeschool laws and private<br/>\n&gt; school regulations that say that kids have to be taught some specific<br/>\n&gt; subjects. &quot;We&quot; interpret that through our unschooling lenses and say,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Kids will learn what they need to learn in a rich a stimulating<br/>\n&gt; environment with supportive adults.&quot; But, the intent is clearly to<br/>\n&gt; require teaching and we&#39;re not doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Right again. I was looking through my rose colored glasses. I realize<br/>\nthere are certain responsibilities that the intent of the law implies,<br/>\nbut after years of reading it and dealing with it my brain<br/>\nautomatically translates all school speak into unschooling terms now.<br/>\nIn hindsight, that&#39;s probably not the most accurate or useful way to<br/>\napproach this topic when helping people who are trying to grasp a very<br/>\nbasic understanding.

I&#39;m not aware of any language that<br/>\nspecifically calls &quot;unschooling&quot; illegal.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, as Vicki said, how you go about unschooling *legally* depends<br/>\non your state. I don&#39;t mean that you must do unschooling differently -<br/>\njust that if your state has strict laws or heavy oversight, you may<br/>\nhave to find a creative way to comply with your state&#39;s requirements.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo begin with, there is no reason to use the word &quot;unschooling&quot; when<br/>\ntalking with or writing to any school or state official. It&#39;s very<br/>\nlikely that they would either be confused because they don&#39;t know what<br/>\nyou&#39;re talking about or become alarmed because they have<br/>\nmisconceptions about unschooling. This could lead to problems that are<br/>\navoidable if you stick to the word &quot;homeschooling&quot; (or whatever your<br/>\nstate calls it - home education, home instruction, etc) when it comes<br/>\nto any official correspondence or communication.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome states require that parents keep attendance. In my opinion, if my<br/>\nchild is awake and present on Earth, then s/he is learning something.<br/>\nYou don&#39;t have to sit a child in a desk and declare it a &quot;school day&quot;<br/>\nto count them as &quot;present&quot; on an attendance sheet.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther states require that you give them a description of curriculum or<br/>\nlesson plans. In this case you can translate their unschooling,<br/>\nday-to-day learning into &quot;school speak&quot;. There are many resources<br/>\nonline that can offer suggestions and advice on how to do this. People<br/>\nin the educational system are more comfortable with paperwork that<br/>\nuses familiar wording and phrases.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been and probably always will be an unknown but relatively<br/>\nsmall number of homeschoolers & unschoolers who decide to fly under<br/>\nthe radar and choose civil disobedience rather than attempting to<br/>\ncomply with the state&#39;s laws, for whatever reason they feel it&#39;s<br/>\nnecessary. I personally wouldn&#39;t recommend this because it&#39;s risky in<br/>\nmany ways and more often than not families can find a way to<br/>\nunschooling and meet state requirements, but each person must<br/>\ndetermine their own path.

If you are in one<br/>\nof the &quot;private school states&quot;  , particularly if in a state that private<br/>\nschools that are private in more than name (in other words, are not<br/>\ngovernment regulated and controlled);  then it is not an issue at all.<br/>\nMany of the concepts of unschooling  have been recognized for decades in<br/>\ncertain institutional private schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are in one of the states that has ALL schools under the jurisdiction<br/>\nof the state educational authority,  then you might need to be a little more<br/>\ncreative in acting as a buffer between your children and bureaucrats.   Same<br/>\nthing if you are in one of the states that sets up special and different<br/>\nrequirements for  &quot;Home schools&quot; .   Doesn&#39;t make unschooling illegal, just<br/>\nmeans that you need to remind yourself how to &quot;translate&quot; what your children<br/>\nare doing naturally into bureaucratic language.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am continually bemused that those who scream loudest about the fundamental<br/>\nrights of parents to raise and educate their children are often the same<br/>\nfolks declaring that unschooling is NOT legal.<br/>\n<br/>\nvicki<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.:  One thing to consider is whether your mindset is such that you think<br/>\nthat to be &quot;legal&quot;  something has to be specifically listed as legal.    The<br/>\nUnited States legal system is based more on the concept that what is  &quot;not<br/>\nillegal&quot;  can be considered &quot;legal&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 6/15/07, beanmommy2 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:beanmommy2@...\">beanmommy2@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   On another list I&#39;m on, someone recently said &quot;I disagree that<br/>\n&gt; unschooling is legal.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This reminded me (if I remember correctly) Sandra saying that an<br/>\n&gt; article in People magazine said that unschooling was legal, when in<br/>\n&gt; actuality it is not.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My daughter just turned six, so we haven&#39;t dealt with the legalities of<br/>\n&gt; this quite yet.
