Perhaps I&#39;m in a &quot;great list&quot; collecting  <br/>\nmood, but some of these items touch on some of the questions recently  <br/>\ndiscussed on this list.<br/>\n<br/>\n13 reasons why I love unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n1. I can stay home with my children and learn beside them.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. My children get to make friends with a wide variety of people.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. We get to cuddle in the morning and talk quietly before we start  <br/>\nthe day.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Despite periodic illness, my kids have perfect attendance records :).<br/>\n<br/>\n5. I trust my children to learn what they need to know when they need  <br/>\nto know it, so they never feel &quot;behind.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n6. No school bullies live here.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. My children get to know me as a full person, not just as a mom.<br/>\n<br/>\n8. The principles of unschooling have helped me to be a better wife,  <br/>\nfriend, and parent.<br/>\n<br/>\n9. Because we unschool, my children do not view learning as a task  <br/>\nthat is separate from their life.<br/>\n<br/>\n10. My boys get the opportunity to truly bond as brothers.<br/>\n<br/>\n11. No cold, early morning, wet, snowy, shivery bus stop.<br/>\n<br/>\n12. Museums, movies, beaches, parks...all are nearly empty, cheaper,  <br/>\nand easy to explore when everyone else is in school.<br/>\n<br/>\n13. I get to be with my kids every day, and I love watching them grow  <br/>\nand change.
