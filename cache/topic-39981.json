If she still chooses no coat, then I respect<br/>\nher choice. Or if she gets cold, I don&#39;t go out of my way to change<br/>\nmy plans and go home for a coat. The logical consequences of not<br/>\nchoosing to bring a coat is being cold.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf she demands that I return for her coat, and I give into her, then<br/>\nI am allowing her to disrespect my needs (to get the doctor&#39;s on<br/>\ntime, for example.)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI felt it was more &quot;teach her a lesson&quot; than &quot;respecting her child&#39;s choice.&quot; I suggested, as did only one other person, that she could have brought a coat for her kid, in case she changed her mind. Then, her daughter would have discovered that her mother was thinking about her needs, in advance of them. That would have been a nice thing to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also had another long-time unschooler (who is a friend) say that her child would have been mortified if she&#39;d brought a coat for him, when he&#39;d made a decision not to wear one. He would always pack his own stuff and was independent from early on, I gather. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy dd, on the other hand, preferred to depend on me to pick up the slack, in case she made an error in judgment. I kind of thought that was my job as *her* mother, but I didn&#39;t respond. By the time I&#39;d thought of it, we&#39;d gotten to the &quot;tea party&quot; stage of &quot;whatever you do is just fine - it&#39;s all unschooling.&quot; I stopped posting then.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin B.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Logic and reasoning before 7 years","postDate":"1226366497","msgId":40108,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMyMDI3MUI2LUEyRDAtNDM3Mi1CNzQyLTMwRkU0NzQ4QzEzNkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdmYTB2aytjMWtkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdmYTB2aytjMWtkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40104,"nextInTopic":40110,"prevInTime":40107,"nextInTime":40109,"topicId":39981,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I read the positive discipline books.

It can be just as difficult <br/>\nfor the moms as it is for the children.  lol  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe question that springs to my mind is how would that woman&#39;s daughter know if she <br/>\nwas interested in your daughter or not if she hasn&#39;t really noticed her and played some <br/>\nwith her.  That&#39;s where the area gets a little gray in some peoples&#39; minds, I guess.  In my <br/>\nopinion, it is to everyone&#39;s benefit to help a new playmate join in.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps that child won&#39;t ultimately fit in, but I think that my daughter&#39;s life may be <br/>\nenhanced by the opportunities that a new person brings, so I do believe it is in her <br/>\ninterest to give a new playmate a chance, so I help her find ways to invite a new child in.  <br/>\nShe is almost always receptive to someone new when I point out that someone would like <br/>\nto join her and her friends.  She often simply will not notice if I don&#39;t point it out.  I can&#39;t <br/>\nimagine a group of adults who are so limited in their thinking.  Maybe there&#39;s a warmer <br/>\ngroup out there that you haven&#39;t found yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat seems like an example of trying to apply a rule/idea to your life that may have <br/>\nworked for someone else, but isn&#39;t very useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I make the worst assumption about that group of girls--that they are excluding your <br/>\ndaughter consistently on purpose--then I think it&#39;s a little evil that their parents are not <br/>\nintervening.  They can call it what they will, but in my mind they are feeding into a lot of <br/>\nthe kind of thinking that we want to help our children get beyond.  There is a tie-in here <br/>\nfor me with the other discussion about brain development.

Labels like permissiveness, radical <br/>\nunschooling, connection parenting have me a little confused.  Could I get some more <br/>\nclarification how these different labels relate to pure and simple unschooling?  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn what interpersonal issues does an unschooling (but not TCS) parent intervene?  I had <br/>\nan experience early on with a park day group that left me uncertain about this.  We were <br/>\nnew to the group, and my daughter asked the group of girls at the park day if she could <br/>\nplay with them.  They replied that they did not want to play with her (they were not rude, <br/>\njust engaged with the group that had always played with).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a couple of weeks of the same response, I metioned it to one of the mothers, hoping <br/>\nshe might help me find a way to ease the transition (as we were new to the group, and my <br/>\ndaughter was interested in playing with the group).  She replied that she would not try to <br/>\nchange her daughter in any way.  She said it was her daughters time at the park, and she <br/>\nonly plays with people that interest her.  She asked if I would force my child to play with <br/>\nsomeone she didn&#39;t want to play with.

I&#39;ll keep looking.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;This seems to suggest that you think parents sit way back and wait  <br/>\n&gt; for a young child to make a choice, and let the choice play out, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; then it&#39;s the parent&#39;s move.  Like some destructive chess game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, that&#39;s not what I think.  But I have never been around an <br/>\nexperienced unschooler and their little kids.  So, I&#39;m trying to <br/>\nfigure out what it looks like from lists and discussions and essays.  <br/>\nAnd obviously what it looks like for someone else&#39;s family will be <br/>\ndifferent from mine, and we have to find our own way.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIRL I know 3 kinds of parents<br/>\n1. Parents who coerce, spank etc.<br/>\n2. Parents who practice gentle discipline (no spanking, no timeouts, <br/>\nfocus on relationship building, understanding age appropriate <br/>\nbehavior, but still coerce)<br/>\n3. Parents who practice non-coercive parenting and watch as their <br/>\nkids damage people, hurt things and do whatever their kid wants as <br/>\nthey brag about how the respect their child&#39;s need to throw food at <br/>\nthe waiter or whatever. <br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone on another board I&#39;m on brought up an interesting idea- <br/>\nunschooling vs. unparenting.  Similar to the unschooling vs. not-<br/>\nschooling that was brought up here recently.  Maybe this is what I&#39;m <br/>\ngetting at.  People call unschoolers permissive because we &quot;let our <br/>\nkids do whatever they want.&quot; But that&#39;s not it.  I would call <br/>\npermissive what I described in #3 above. I don&#39;t want to be that <br/>\nparent.  I don&#39;t want to &quot;unparent.&quot;  I don&#39;t think most <br/>\nunschooers &quot;unparent,&quot; but I also don&#39;t want to coerce.  So, I&#39;m <br/>\ntrying to learn how to find that balance.  And I think the key is <br/>\nconnection.  I&#39;m just trying to find my way, I guess.  Putting belief <br/>\ninto practice.  And I&#39;m probably not making any sense.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Logic and reasoning before 7 years","postDate":"1226231617","msgId":40007,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMyQjU4RkNDLTYyNEEtNEFBMS1BNTUzLUFCNTYwQzE0OTgwOUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdmNWtqais2bjNiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdmNWtqais2bjNiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39998,"nextInTopic":40056,"prevInTime":40006,"nextInTime":40008,"topicId":39981,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
