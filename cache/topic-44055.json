That is a LOT of school,<br/>\nfor not even being school age.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t hold your daughter to her score that she got at the age of 3.<br/>\nLots of kids have lots of talents, sometimes they are way ahead of<br/>\nothers their own age in various things and sometimes they are way<br/>\nbehind.

There is a lot of information out<br/>\nthere about that, there are expensive private schools that base their<br/>\neducation on it!  Maybe, for now, do lots of things with your kids that<br/>\nare involved and interesting and engaging, keep them busy with fun<br/>\nactivities where your husband can see physical results of those<br/>\nprojects.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did that a lot when my oldest was little because my husband didn&#39;t<br/>\nreally get unschooling.  We did a LOT of projects and field trips.  He<br/>\ncould see that she was creatively engaged with life and that helped him<br/>\nrelax and let me do what I wanted to do.

School is so integrated into<br/>\npeople&#39;s lives, our culture, and the way people live.  As my oldest has<br/>\ngotten older, so have her schooled friends.  Something that my husband<br/>\nand I have noticed is how parents stop really seeing their kids.  By the<br/>\ntime they are in middle school they are so far into seeing their kids<br/>\nthrough the lense of how well they do in school, that nothing else<br/>\nreally matters.  As long as the kids are getting good grades the parents<br/>\nand kids get along fine.  Parenting is no longer about raising kids, and<br/>\nhelping them become wonderful people, it&#39;s ALL about making sure they<br/>\nget good grades and graduate.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have something different than that!  We have real people for kids,<br/>\nreal people with real feelings and real likes and dislikes.  Unschooling<br/>\npreserves that &quot;sight&quot;, being able to see your kids for the people that<br/>\nthey are.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; We paint, color, go for walks, do puzzles and my girls have tons of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>play w/out me. They also like to help me cook and clean.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might help for you to see those activities and how and what your kids<br/>\nare learning from them.  Puzzles build math and spatial skills. <br/>\nCleaning builds organizational skills, detail data.  Cooking can be oh<br/>\nso many things.  A walk in the park can be one huge discovery of<br/>\necology, or it could be all about physical exhertion and knowledge of<br/>\nhow bodies work.  These are just examples, small examples.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; My oldest has some Kindergarten workbooks that she got for her 3rd<br/>\n </span></blockquote>bday from a friend. I leave them out and she picks them up every now and<br/>\nthen. Sometimes she asks for help and others she just browses the pages<br/>\nwith her sister.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe always had workbooks and coloring books and the like.  We have some<br/>\nstill from when my oldest was little, that my youngest has pulled out<br/>\nand played with.  They get used sometimes, and sometimes not.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nrecycled loads of them over the years.  I never graded them or had any<br/>\ninvestment in them as fill in answer type things.  They were toys,<br/>\nthings to play around with.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; I feel there is more I should be doing with them.

There are so many things you can do with young kids that don&#39;t<br/>\ncost loads of money!  Sometimes I wish I was still there... the ways in<br/>\nwhich I need to support my older daughter these days costs money, there<br/>\nis no way around that!  It&#39;s a fact of life that kids cost money! <br/>\nUnschooling costs money, homeschooling costs money, even public school<br/>\ncosts money (do you even know how many fundraisers they have?)!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Newbie here :)","postDate":"1239814660","msgId":44056,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI2RTI1NEJCLTVEMzEtNDRCQi04Q0Q1LThCNjlFQTM3N0RCRUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdzNG9icytqb3FvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdzNG9icytqb3FvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44055,"nextInTopic":44059,"prevInTime":44055,"nextInTime":44057,"topicId":44055,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I m in VA and will be attending the HEAV conference with my husband in June.-=- If there won t be unschoolers there, don t go.

I&#39;m a SAHM to two girls 4 and 2<br/>\nI&#39;m in VA and will be attending the HEAV conference with my husband in June.<br/>\nI always said I would never homeschool my kids, then one day I woke up with it heavy on my heart. It was a hard pill for my husband to swallow. He&#39;s not completely on board either. He doesn&#39;t understand that I want unschooling to be a way of life for us. The way I see it, we&#39;ve been unschooling since birth, why stop now? I read John Holt&#39;s &#39;Learning all the time&#39; Loved it!<br/>\n<br/>\nDH grew up with education pounded into his head. Go to school and learn this this and that.<br/>\nHe often tries to teach dd things when she is having fun on her own. Every single time she stops and finds something else to do.<br/>\nI hated school and now wish I had been homeschooled. I think I would&#39;ve done so much better.<br/>\n<br/>\nEverything our girls know they taught themselves.<br/>\nMy oldest is in speech therapy 5 days a week for 3 hours a day. She loves riding the bus and going to &quot;school&quot;.<br/>\nWhen she was 3 she scored on the level of a 5 yr old for colors, numbers and letters and word recognition.<br/>\nMy husband said we could try homeschooling this year. She is supposed to register for Kindergarten next year. She&#39;ll be 5 in December.<br/>\nHe was totally against the idea at first, but now he&#39;s open to it and wants to read more and learn more about homeschooling. Whenever I say unschooling to him he gets tense, lol<br/>\nI know it&#39;s because he doesn&#39;t get it yet. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m scared.
