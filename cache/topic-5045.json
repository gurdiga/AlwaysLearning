Often. Just as you described.<br/>\nFreeform art  and crafts work better around here, and only if they want to<br/>\ndo it. They initiate it, or they may join in if I&#39;m doing something. If I<br/>\nwant to do something I need to concentrate on or I think will be a problem<br/>\nfor them (based on past experience) I wait and do it when they&#39;re asleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nSewing may just mean using a needle and thread to make a giant globby ball<br/>\nof fabric. Crafting with popsicle sticks may mean gluing them into a solid<br/>\nmass. That makes kids happy at a certain time. Happy is important. &quot;<br/>\nCompleting something&quot; only happens if it&#39;s important to them. There may be<br/>\ngaps of weeks or months between attempts. This stuff is work for them, not<br/>\njust doing something for relaxation like it often is for adults. One of my<br/>\nkids has done maybe 2 craft projects in his life, his choice. He is not<br/>\nunfulfilled. He now draws, builds models, takes things apart, makes<br/>\ninventions. These things are work to him. He gets frustrated, he abandons<br/>\nprojects, he completes projects.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, if you are talking weaving paper hearts from 2 pieces of paper (the<br/>\nDanish heart thingies), I was showing adults how to do that in December. I<br/>\nhad to put my hands on theirs to guide them in some cases, they were having<br/>\nso much trouble.

I am a morning<br/>\nperson and I am usually  alone with kids in evening because of hubby&#39;s<br/>\nschedule so I&#39;m wiped out at night. I used to prep for evening early if I<br/>\ncould, like laying the clothes out ahead of time, when everyone is not so<br/>\ntired. Or sleep in the day&#39;s clothes and do baths in am.

I remember thinking my friend Chris was spoiled (meaning <br/>\nruined for life, in my thinking) because when he was a teen and in college <br/>\nhis mom still did his laundry totally, and put it in his drawer, and made his <br/>\nbed.  But I was probably just jealous.  And at the same time he never ever <br/>\nmissed a social obligation involving his family, and he would lovingly wash <br/>\nand wax his mom&#39;s car.  He didn&#39;t leave home until he was over 21.  But he <br/>\nstill loves his mom sweetly, and he took GREAT care of his own apartment (now <br/>\nhouse), better than I ever have or will.    I was wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I know more families where the parents pressed their children to be <br/>\nindependent, not to be needy, and those kids are my age and still needy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s nothing in my personal experience or observation to support pressing <br/>\nkids to get their own spoon and bowl if they really want help.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne day Marty told me that the food tasted better when I got it for him.  He <br/>\nwas twelve, I think.  He can and usually does get his own food, but that day <br/>\nhe wanted me to make him something.

OK here&#39;s the bottom.  Maybe they will put on <br/>\nthe bottoms by themselves, then hand them the top.  Don&#39;t say - see I <br/>\nknew you could do it.  Don&#39;t say - you&#39;re such a big boy for putting <br/>\non your pj&#39;s.  Give him a hug and say - great, now do you want me to <br/>\nread you a story or whatever.  This is an easy way to give them <br/>\nattention and they don&#39;t need to master getting dressed to feel <br/>\ncapable.

He <br/>\ndid want to do the activity. He set a barrier of not liking to get his hands <br/>\nsticky, so he really could not do the activity. I tried stating how <br/>\nfrustrating it must be. How dissapointeed he was for not being able to do it <br/>\nthe way he wanted to. I showed him I was sticky. We talked about washing his <br/>\nhands after. His older sister was finding the craft very satisfying and <br/>\nmaybe this plays into it. He is feeling inferior. He did sob a ton about <br/>\nwanting to be bigger. He screamed, flipped onto the floor, threatened to <br/>\nturn the table over and then sobbed in his room. Nothing comforted him. He <br/>\nis showing perfectionist attributes and maybe this is it. I am not ever <br/>\nperfect, so it is hard for me to relate. I&#39;m asking for coping skills when <br/>\nthe kids flood due to frustrations. My oldest, 7 has a similar tendancy.

I have 3 <br/>\nkids, all very close in age. Baby is 2 and usually gets her needs met first. <br/>\nA very tired cranky hubby in the pm. Helping to put pj&#39;s on is real help for <br/>\nthe family. Jumping up and down on the bed screaming I can&#39;t is wearing out <br/>\nour tired nerves. Riley does know how to open a drawer. He can dress <br/>\nhimself. Riley wants to be in control of the situation. I do find I <br/>\ngenerally help my little guy. I like to do the jammies together. Hubby on <br/>\nthe other hand feels if he can do it he should do it. So, when kids are <br/>\ncapable of a skill but refuse to do it for some reason, what have others <br/>\ndone to help show the children they can do it and it feels good to be <br/>\ncapable. Am I more clear now?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe my kids tend to flood way more than others so I&#39;m stuck in trying to <br/>\nsurround them with skills to help them cope. Mine fight with each other.

When we have lots <br/>\nof these types of experiences I wonder are we really thriving at home. This <br/>\nis the hard part for me at home. How can they be so frustrated so much of <br/>\nthe time. We give them so much freedom and they throw us a ton of garbage <br/>\nback it seems. Any way. I&#39;m tired, thought I would try to generate more <br/>\nsolutions for a chronic problem that gets in our way of an enriching life.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary H.<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nJoin the world�s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5099,"nextTopicId":4852}}
