Not one single person in this whole wide world can<br/>\nbe convinced that unschooling will work and work fabulously, unless they<br/>\nreally want it!  I&#39;m not going to convince a meat eater to become a<br/>\nvegetarian unless they were considering it to begin with!   If someone<br/>\nis stuck in their belief that controlling kids is the only way to raise<br/>\nkids, then gosh darn it, they will do that and lots of it and come up<br/>\nwith all sorts of arguments to convince me it&#39;s the case!  And, no,<br/>\nanecdotal information doesn&#39;t count to counter their belief system, as<br/>\nso much of the information on unschooling is anecdotal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was re-reading &quot;How Children Learn&quot;, last night, partly to recharge my<br/>\nthinking, and was once again intrigued by his thinking.  I really liked<br/>\nwhat he was saying about studies done on children, and his conviction<br/>\nthat anecdotal information is often more reliable, even if you are going<br/>\noff of someone&#39;s word or interpretation, because, studies done on<br/>\nchildren inherently take them out of their natural environment, while an<br/>\nobservational study won&#39;t.  Well, that&#39;s what I got out of it when I was<br/>\nreading last night, others may have another take on this idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo many studies done on children are skewed in the perspective on the<br/>\nmaker of the study.  Not only that, they are done on school children,<br/>\nand I see a huge huge difference in how my always unschooled children<br/>\nare and how they behave and interact with the world!  A long time ago,<br/>\nSandra, said that unschooled children are like the control group.  I<br/>\nlike that!  How can so many studies on children, not have a control<br/>\ngroup?!  Staticians don&#39;t even see school in that manner affecting<br/>\nstudies and outcomes of those studies!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Can I talk here?","postDate":"1227395427","msgId":40372,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQwM0I4QTg1LTVCQzEtNEU0Ri1BQTRBLTAyN0I1Q0RGM0UxMEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDlmNzJkNzYyMDgxMTIyMTQ0Mmo3ZGRkOTE3OXIzZTgxMGJjYzgxM2UzMjAyQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDA0ZmIwMWM5NGM3NyRiOWQ2MDU0MCQ2NDBhYTlhOUBHb256bz4gPDlmNzJkNzYyMDgxMTIyMTQ0Mmo3ZGRkOTE3OXIzZTgxMGJjYzgxM2UzMjAyQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40371,"nextInTopic":40373,"prevInTime":40371,"nextInTime":40373,"topicId":40367,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I think there is probably also an Oregon group on the Radical Unschoolers Network: http://familyrun.ning.com/ I know that there is a PNW group.-=- The good","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1720528328\">-=-I think there is probably also an Oregon group on the Radical<br/>\nUnschoolers Network: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://familyrun.ning.com/\">http://familyrun.ning.com/</a> I know that there<br/>\nis a PNW group.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe good thing about that site is that there are photos, and there&#39;s  <br/>\nhumor, and it can be way chit-chatty.

I am also on<br/>\n&gt; a few other groups, but all just since June of this year as we are new to<br/>\n&gt; unschooling. I had read some stuff about it (felt like it sort of followed<br/>\n&gt; the path I was on with Attachment Parenting, Unconditional/Peaceful/Playful<br/>\n&gt; Parenting, and such) and a friend convinced me to go to the Life Is Good<br/>\n&gt; Conference here in Portland (well, it&#39;s across the river in Vancouver, but<br/>\n&gt; close enough!) in May and I just loved it. :) The atmosphere was wonderful<br/>\n&gt; as were the many people I met there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In an effort to get more of that vibe and influence in my life, I joined a<br/>\n&gt; few online groups. First one, then another, now I think I am on 5 such<br/>\n&gt; groups! And I can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t join this one right away, but I sort of<br/>\n&gt; felt like as a newbie I wasn&#39;t ready for the big leagues! Mostly I just read<br/>\n&gt; in the beginning. That&#39;s what the instructions said to do. I read a lot. I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t post right away because I didn&#39;t want to seem ignorant or have people<br/>\n&gt; tear my words apart. Often other people asked what I wanted to ask and I<br/>\n&gt; learned from the dialogue that followed. But now (I know, amazingly in just<br/>\n&gt; a few short months!), now I am very comfortable with the vibe of most lists<br/>\n&gt; where the majority of posters are passionate about unschooling and ask the<br/>\n&gt; really hard questions of us newbies (which we need). I&#39;m sure many of those<br/>\n&gt; people are also on this list too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am always learning, so I think this is a good place for me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; However, in my journey I am facing a new problem. After the conference, I<br/>\n&gt; had a desire to meet other unschoolers in real life. I wanted more positive<br/>\n&gt; interactions than just at the conference! I had met some people there, but I<br/>\n&gt; knew there had to be other families in the area, some I didn&#39;t meet and<br/>\n&gt; others who didn&#39;t even attend LIG. So I sought out my local unschoolers<br/>\n&gt; list. And I am disappointed. It is not anything like these<br/>\n&gt; national/international lists.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here is where I complain. There are a few (very few) people on this local<br/>\n&gt; board who seem to &quot;get it&quot; but many more who don&#39;t. It&#39;s like a bunch of<br/>\n&gt; homeschoolers have latched on to the term unschooling and think it only<br/>\n&gt; means that they do not use a set curriculum in their school at home. For<br/>\n&gt; them it does not extend to their lives, to parenting, or in general<br/>\n&gt; respecting their kids. Maybe they think it does, or maybe they think it<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t have to. The vibe of some recent posts is basically a few women<br/>\n&gt; (mostly with younger children) telling everyone how they live with certain<br/>\n&gt; structures, controls, and limits for their kids and basically saying that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; what works for their family so don&#39;t question it. I made the mistake of<br/>\n&gt; questioning some of these things and seriously people came out of the<br/>\n&gt; woodwork to tell me off! They have rules for everything. No TV (or very<br/>\n&gt; limited in time they were allowed to watch and some limited the shows their<br/>\n&gt; kids were allowed to watch), bedtime at 8:30 sharp, lunch at noon, no sugar<br/>\n&gt; in the house, and more. Sugar and TV seem to be BIG and I mean HUGE things<br/>\n&gt; that people were very defensive about. Saying that because they have<br/>\n&gt; &quot;reasons&quot; for limiting such things it is not arbitrary and who are we to<br/>\n&gt; question what is working for them. (Um, because this is an UNschooling group<br/>\n&gt; and you are NOT unschooling?!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is this common in smaller local groups? I am so sad that I am not getting to<br/>\n&gt; meet other similar minded folks. Well, that is not true. I had one ally (who<br/>\n&gt; has older children and much more experience than me with this) who asked the<br/>\n&gt; same questions I did and even went deeper into an explanation of things like<br/>\n&gt; cause and effect and how they can&#39;t see now what they are teaching their<br/>\n&gt; children. She got blasted more than I did! It got ugly. So I called her up<br/>\n&gt; and we met with our kids and had a great time. So at least one good thing<br/>\n&gt; has come of this!

I had read some stuff about it (felt like it sort of followed<br/>\nthe path I was on with Attachment Parenting, Unconditional/Peaceful/Playful<br/>\nParenting, and such) and a friend convinced me to go to the Life Is Good<br/>\nConference here in Portland (well, it&#39;s across the river in Vancouver, but<br/>\nclose enough!) in May and I just loved it. :) The atmosphere was wonderful<br/>\nas were the many people I met there.<br/>\n <br/>\nIn an effort to get more of that vibe and influence in my life, I joined a<br/>\nfew online groups. First one, then another, now I think I am on 5 such<br/>\ngroups! And I can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t join this one right away, but I sort of<br/>\nfelt like as a newbie I wasn&#39;t ready for the big leagues! Mostly I just read<br/>\nin the beginning. That&#39;s what the instructions said to do. I read a lot. I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t post right away because I didn&#39;t want to seem ignorant or have people<br/>\ntear my words apart. Often other people asked what I wanted to ask and I<br/>\nlearned from the dialogue that followed. But now (I know, amazingly in just<br/>\na few short months!), now I am very comfortable with the vibe of most lists<br/>\nwhere the majority of posters are passionate about unschooling and ask the<br/>\nreally hard questions of us newbies (which we need). I&#39;m sure many of those<br/>\npeople are also on this list too.<br/>\n <br/>\nI am always learning, so I think this is a good place for me.<br/>\n <br/>\nHowever, in my journey I am facing a new problem. After the conference, I<br/>\nhad a desire to meet other unschoolers in real life. I wanted more positive<br/>\ninteractions than just at the conference! I had met some people there, but I<br/>\nknew there had to be other families in the area, some I didn&#39;t meet and<br/>\nothers who didn&#39;t even attend LIG. So I sought out my local unschoolers<br/>\nlist. And I am disappointed. It is not anything like these<br/>\nnational/international lists. <br/>\n <br/>\nHere is where I complain. There are a few (very few) people on this local<br/>\nboard who seem to &quot;get it&quot; but many more who don&#39;t. It&#39;s like a bunch of<br/>\nhomeschoolers have latched on to the term unschooling and think it only<br/>\nmeans that they do not use a set curriculum in their school at home. For<br/>\nthem it does not extend to their lives, to parenting, or in general<br/>\nrespecting their kids. Maybe they think it does, or maybe they think it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have to. The vibe of some recent posts is basically a few women<br/>\n(mostly with younger children) telling everyone how they live with certain<br/>\nstructures, controls, and limits for their kids and basically saying that&#39;s<br/>\nwhat works for their family so don&#39;t question it. I made the mistake of<br/>\nquestioning some of these things and seriously people came out of the<br/>\nwoodwork to tell me off! They have rules for everything. No TV (or very<br/>\nlimited in time they were allowed to watch and some limited the shows their<br/>\nkids were allowed to watch), bedtime at 8:30 sharp, lunch at noon, no sugar<br/>\nin the house, and more. Sugar and TV seem to be BIG and I mean HUGE things<br/>\nthat people were very defensive about. Saying that because they have<br/>\n&quot;reasons&quot; for limiting such things it is not arbitrary and who are we to<br/>\nquestion what is working for them. (Um, because this is an UNschooling group<br/>\nand you are NOT unschooling?!)<br/>\n <br/>\nIs this common in smaller local groups? I am so sad that I am not getting to<br/>\nmeet other similar minded folks. Well, that is not true. I had one ally (who<br/>\nhas older children and much more experience than me with this) who asked the<br/>\nsame questions I did and even went deeper into an explanation of things like<br/>\ncause and effect and how they can&#39;t see now what they are teaching their<br/>\nchildren. She got blasted more than I did! It got ugly. So I called her up<br/>\nand we met with our kids and had a great time. So at least one good thing<br/>\nhas come of this! One new friend!! <br/>\n <br/>\nJust wondering what to do now. I suppose I should just stop reading over<br/>\nthere. Yeah, tell me the obvious. Anyway, I&#39;m here to learn! I&#39;ve got some<br/>\nissues ya&#39;ll can help me with as no one else I know seems to be able to<br/>\nrelate! I just didn&#39;t want to dump it all out there on Day 1. :p<br/>\n <br/>\nMy name is Kim, DH (since 93) is Geoff, and our son is Damon (4). We live in<br/>\nHillsboro, Oregon, just on the west side of Portland. We&#39;ve lived here 8<br/>\nyears and I do not have a hometown, my dad was active military so I have<br/>\nlived in many states and seen most of this great country of ours.<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks for the online community.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40599,"nextTopicId":40608}}
