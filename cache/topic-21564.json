Good<br/>\ncharacter development in a movie won&#39;t need narration to convey  the<br/>\ncharacter&#39;s thoughts and motivations.  -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n================<br/>\n <br/>\nSomething else about this:<br/>\nIt&#39;s the kind of subtle acting not seen since storytelling around a fire in  <br/>\ncastles or woods, if even then.<br/>\n <br/>\nStage acting doesn&#39;t do it.  But very-close-up (&quot;over edited&quot;?   Was that the <br/>\ndisparaging word?) TV and movie acting can show facial twitch and  eye <br/>\nmovement that can be read by those with interpersonal intelligence to read  it.   <br/>\nDenzel Washington.  Robin Williams.

Some people can be standing next to  someone <br/>\nwho is distraught or anxious or embarrased or bursting with excitement,  and <br/>\nunless the person says, &quot;HEY, BUBBETTE,  I am  <br/>\n[distraught/anxious/embarrassed/full-of-news,&quot; Bubbette might act entirely  inappropriately to the situation.<br/>\n <br/>\nMaybe (possibly) that&#39;s one clue to why someone would reject TV/movies and  <br/>\nprefer books, which can be experienced in the absence of social skills.
