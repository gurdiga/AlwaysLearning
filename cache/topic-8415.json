Even the Order of the Arrow things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was also a Brownie leader at age 15...had my own<br/>\ntroop of little girls, in Oregon. We were pretty<br/>\nrelaxed. Did a lot of hiking and singing and helped<br/>\nthem learn to use pocket knives, make fires, other<br/>\nforbidden stuff. :-). I had fun vicariously extending<br/>\nand enhancing my childhood through other little girls<br/>\nand my little sister, Little Sister was too little to<br/>\nbe a Brownie, then, so taking care of her was part of<br/>\nthe game.  My bothers helped out some, too.
