One might say &quot;Well, DUH!&quot; and one would be right, no doubt.  When I was upset about the ignorant, rude, HORRIBLE comments attached to a video of Holly talking about unschooling on youtube, Kirby laughed and said they were youtube comments.  They were GOING to be that way, and I shouldn&#39;t have read them.  I think he meant &quot;Well, DUH!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a couple of people there whom I was tempted to put on read-only, which I could do if they were here, but can&#39;t do on a facebook group.  There, it&#39;s either let them continue to froth and spew, or remove them completely.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat made me miss this group with its walls and its trapdoor (and its couple of trolls, but they&#39;re more harmless than they would like to be) :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-If it had to be child-led in any way, my son would watch tv all day.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nNothing &quot;has to be&quot; child led, and in glowing fact that response was on a blog post of Pam Sorooshian&#39;s which begins (in black words on a white background, in normal English):   <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I do not refer to unschooling as “child-led learning” and I encourage others not to use that term because I think overuse of it has led to some pretty serious misunderstanding of what unschooling is really like.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI think perhaps just as dozens of people have read six words of <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/joyce/yes\">http://sandradodd.com/joyce/yes</a> and gone off to screw up some lives, some people will read the beginning of Pam&#39;s article and feel justified in telling their kids what to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think I don&#39;t feel guilty about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone was complaining about strewing, and suggesting (I think) that if people misunderstood it, it was because I hadn&#39;t been clear enough.<br/>\nReally?  I clarified something I wrote casually fifteen years or more ago.  I expanded on it.  I have twenty webpages about it, and someone thinks it would be helpful if she explained to me that if people don&#39;t understand it, it&#39;s because I didn&#39;t phrase it well?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the correspondents in that musicless mosh pit said her son was lazy, but because she wrote &quot;lazy&quot; wanted us not to suggest she had said lazy, because she put quotation marks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people won&#39;t mess with wild discussions like that at all, and I don&#39;t blame them, but sometimes it&#39;s a great contrast to the relative peace and calm here.  :-)   And every single time, someone is jarred into a new understanding of some aspect of what some of us have been trying to explain in various ways for a long time.   And sometimes one of them is someone who can help clarify it for others.  At the point that someone *gets it* (some aspect of it), all the dust settles around some sparkly learning, regardless of how many people willfully created more output than they were worth, in that context.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a frenzy of weirdness, but even in that, people are learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nreferences<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/strewing\">http://sandradodd.com/strewing</a>  (some explanation of and ideas about strewing)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://learninghappens.wordpress.com/2011/09/24/unschooling-is-not-child-led-learning/\">http://learninghappens.wordpress.com/2011/09/24/unschooling-is-not-child-led-learning/</a>  (Pam&#39;s blog post)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/groups/303347574750/\">http://www.facebook.com/groups/303347574750/</a>  Radical Unschooling Info    • 1,117 Members (the melee)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65355,"nextTopicId":65362}}
