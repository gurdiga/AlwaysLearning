I believe cooling off<br/>\nbefore you lose it is really important with teenagers.<br/>\nNot that I never lost it, when they headed into these<br/>\nphases we were in yelling matches and power struggle<br/>\nfrequently.

It sounds as if he is developmentally<br/>\nnormal.. HURRAY HUH...With my two grown sons we went<br/>\nthrough a time that was unbearable. Especially tough<br/>\nwith my son who thought he knew everything and could<br/>\nnot be wrong. <br/>\nI was a foster parent for years. I helped lots of<br/>\nteenage girls and boys have trouble get through that<br/>\ntough time, but when my kids went through it all my<br/>\nbuttons were pushed. My second son could have me<br/>\nacting like a maniac in five minutes flat till I<br/>\nfigured out non confrontational was the way to go with<br/>\nhim. So what did work was to make sure I took care of<br/>\nmyself. No one can call me a name and expect my<br/>\ncooperation.  Sometimes I would just walk away and<br/>\ncontinue with my life. With son number two I would<br/>\nhave to wait till the situation settled and then make<br/>\nI statements.. Like, &quot;I would really appreciate you<br/>\ntaking care of your things when you have a chance,<br/>\nThanks a lot bud&quot;. I believe that teenagers have such<br/>\nan internal struggle going on that in many ways they<br/>\nrevert to much younger behavior.  So a once<br/>\nresponsible kid forgets and is so absorbed in self<br/>\nthat what seem like normal demands to us become<br/>\noverwhelming and irrationally irritating to them. I am<br/>\nseeing it now with my daughter.. The only bonus is I<br/>\nknow they turn back into their best selves again. <br/>\nBoth sons are some of the finest folks I know.So<br/>\nplease take my compassion and know that this too will<br/>\npass.<br/>\nKathleen<br/>\nvery fortunate<br/>\nmom of eight<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sluror@...\">sluror@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and never been wrong!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s a smart kid, he knows it.

He had found a deep<br/>\n&gt; root watering thingy in the trash a couple days<br/>\n&gt; earlier, it was still<br/>\n&gt; attached to the hose but he said that would work<br/>\n&gt; fine for washing up. I<br/>\n&gt; turned on the spigot and told him we&#39;d have to move<br/>\n&gt; down near the street<br/>\n&gt; so the chemicals wouldn&#39;t kill my garden, but the<br/>\n&gt; thingy must have been<br/>\n&gt; clogged for no water was coming out. We realized it<br/>\n&gt; had to come off the<br/>\n&gt; hose. DUH! right. I couldn&#39;t find the nozzle and<br/>\n&gt; asked him where he put<br/>\n&gt; it when he removed it to hook up the DRW thingy.<br/>\n&gt; Frustrated, he said to<br/>\n&gt; just pull the hose down towards the street without<br/>\n&gt; it. I&#39;m living in<br/>\n&gt; drought country here, it&#39;s a waste to turn the water<br/>\n&gt; on and let it flow<br/>\n&gt; freely and unused and besides I figured the pressure<br/>\n&gt; the nozzle makes<br/>\n&gt; would work better anyway. I asked again where the<br/>\n&gt; nozzle is, he cursed<br/>\n&gt; and grumbled something about the cleaner and how it<br/>\n&gt; was going to eat<br/>\n&gt; through his skin. I find the nozzle hidden in a<br/>\n&gt; plant, put it on the<br/>\n&gt; hose, turn the spigot back on and head towards him<br/>\n&gt; but he was gone. I<br/>\n&gt; hear the garage door open and shut, he&#39;s in the<br/>\n&gt; house washing up.
