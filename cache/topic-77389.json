We \nlearn along with her, about unschooling, self-directed learning, \nexperiential learning, and that there are many different names for very \nsimilar philosophies. She meets and interviews families who all have \namazing and interesting stories.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Rather than just following the current paradigm, she set off to figure out what would work best for her son and her family.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">And she made an incredible and enlightening film as she learned, and that is what makes it so, so beautiful.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>Please read the synopsis here: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br></b></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b><br></b></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b><i>Being\n and Becoming explores the theme of trusting children and their \ndevelopment, and invites us to question our learning paradigms and \noptions.</i></b></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><i><b>The filmmaker takes us on a \njourney of discovery through the US, France, the UK and Germany (where \nit&#39;s illegal not to go to school.)
