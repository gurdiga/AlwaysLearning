I didn&#39;t want them in Private school <br/>\nbecause of what I had experienced and decided to let them do Public from the <br/>\nbeginning. I had never heard of unschooling at that time and the only <br/>\nhomeschooling I had ever heard of was completely religious based, so I really <br/>\nhad no idea that my way of learning was out there, just thought I was weird. <br/>\nI was a super active room mom and sure enough, I saw not much was different <br/>\nin the Public venue than in my school experience, they just didn&#39;t pray. Then <br/>\nI found HSC and that led to an unschooling thread and then to <br/>\nUnschooling.com. That was 3 years ago. We unschooled from the moment I <br/>\ncleaned their desks out at school. It was such a relief and it fits our home <br/>\nso well even though my kids do not learn the same way I do at all. But we are <br/>\nlearning from each other, that it is ok to learn our own way. Either way we <br/>\nhave all grown leaps and bounds and the only regret I have is that I didn&#39;t <br/>\nknow I was &quot;OK&quot; and could trust my kids would be too, from the beginning. I&#39;m <br/>\nhappy to have found all of you too!<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nRhonda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14136,"nextTopicId":14179}}
