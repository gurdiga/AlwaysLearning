(They&#39;re baaaack....!)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou say you didn&#39;t notice I was gone....that&#39;s okay...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I have all these posts backed up, no time to read, and caught up this <br/>\nmorning. I need to make a point to do that, because I need to hear <br/>\nunschooling voices more. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been dealing with a torn-up kitchen (getting new cabinets, etc.), and <br/>\nthis week, a very sick kitty. Simone is 18 1/2 years old, and suddenly <br/>\nstopped being able to walk. Turns out she has a thyroid problem, and she&#39;s <br/>\ngaining strength, but still can&#39;t walk and has needed us around pretty much <br/>\nconstantly.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulian is almost 13, and it makes me melt just looking at him. He&#39;s so <br/>\nbeautiful and sweet and smart and funny. MIT offers these enrichment <br/>\nprograms, classes taught mostly by MIT students, and Julian has signed <br/>\nup...He&#39;s taking two courses, two nights a week for five weeks. He LOVES <br/>\nthis. He loves wandering the campus, and he&#39;s taking pretty intense stuff: a <br/>\nbiology course (and he loves that he already knows a lot from teaching <br/>\nhimself) and a course called Refuse and Resist, about Social Activism. My <br/>\nlittle hippy; I&#39;m so proud.  I don&#39;t know if I would have been so <br/>\nenthusiastic and comfortable doing this at 12, where most of the kids are <br/>\nolder, etc. I am in awe of this boy, not for taking classes, but because he <br/>\nloves to learn so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am trying to put a book proposal together for the spirituality book I&#39;m <br/>\nwriting, and we&#39;re hoping to actually take some vacation time. It&#39;s probably <br/>\ntricky with the sick cat. Send Kitty energy!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad to be back!<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n(Mama to Julian, 12, and partner to Beth)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7860,"nextTopicId":7863}}
