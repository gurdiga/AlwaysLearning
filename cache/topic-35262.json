Some <br/>\ninstructors are more harsh than others so that&#39;s one thing I would <br/>\nalways look at. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI would definitely try some schools out, before deciding.  My son had a friend at his TaeKwonDo school who quit ballet because her instructor was &quot;too mean&quot; (her words), but she didn&#39;t mind the TKD instructor who seemed even meaner, in her parent&#39;s perspective.  It felt different to her, less personal or something.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur TKD school does this program where you get stars to put on your belt for good grades, which kind of turns me off, but when Richard was younger he wanted to have stars on his belt &quot;like everyone else.&quot;  So every cycle I filled out the form, always giving him the maximum number of stars.  It became less important to him as time went on.  Now he has his name and rank embroidered on his belt, no room for stars &lt;g&gt;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have an interesting story about something that happened at our TaeKwonDo academy the other day.<br/>\nI don&#39;t remember if this is one of the lists that I posted about it or not, but a few years ago someone turned me in to Child Protective Services for having a &quot;9 year old who had never been to school&quot; and a &quot;dangerously messy house.&quot;  It freaked me out, but I knew the state homeschool regulations better than the social worker did, my home was inspected twice, the initial time when she showed up unexpectedly and one follow-up, all allegations were unsubstantiated and it is all good now.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course one of the social worker&#39;s concerns was &quot;socialization.&quot;  &lt;g&gt;  Well at TKD the other evening I saw that social worker for the first time since she &quot;visited&quot; my house.  Her son, who is maybe 4 or 5 years older than mine, is now a green belt at our academy. Richard, my son, is a black belt and a trainee instructor.  Richard is a very tall boy, and though he loves being silly and having fun, he is pretty reserved and quiet most of the time.  He usually trains with the adults both because of his height and his &quot;maturity.&quot;  Anyway, it was interesting to watch Richard coaching and guiding her much older son.  I don&#39;t think she is concerned about socialization anymore!  &lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nKaty<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":159184374,"authorName":"elwazani","from":"&quot;elwazani&quot; &lt;elwazani@...&gt;","profile":"elwazani","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Martial Arts","postDate":"1212852434","msgId":35276,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGcyZTljaSs4czY2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDdEMjQ2NTFELTQ4MUQtNEY1Ri1CQUI5LUY0NThBQjRCMDVCNEBtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":35275,"nextInTopic":35277,"prevInTime":35275,"nextInTime":35277,"topicId":35262,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I loved watching <br/>\nLiam, this small boy, helping big guys, some twice his height, the <br/>\ntechniques.  It was a very enriching experience in so many <br/>\nways.
