So that <br/>\nwhen you have a baby, you begin that again with a new person, perhaps <br/>\nthe 3 of you together doing that kind of dreaming and planning and <br/>\ndoing.  And you move in and out of each others space as the child grows <br/>\nand the interactions change and evolve and you separate and come <br/>\ntogether, just like when one partner goes off to work or goes fishing or <br/>\nsomething.
