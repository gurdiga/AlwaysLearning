I don&#39;t think anyone here is advocating a high sugar diet.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI used to be pretty &quot;crunchy,&quot;  my son (10 next month) had no refined sugar before his first birthday.  His first birthday cake was his first taste of not only sugar but also artificial color.  My views have changed enormously.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast week my son and I made brownies.  We ate half of the batter raw (yum!) while watching a movie and playing a board game (Simpson&#39;s Clue), and baked the rest.  There are still quite a few brownies left, a week later.  But the plums and nectarines that I got the same day are long gone.  So is the milk, regular and  chocolate soy, and string cheese.   Given choices, and the knowledge that I trust my son&#39;s choices, he makes great nutritional decisions.  I guarantee that I eat more sugar than he does.  <br/>\n<br/>\nVilifying sugar will only make it a forbidden fruit, and most people, adults and children alike,  will sneak to get it, or binge when it is available.  I am not talking about diseases or syndromes where sugar is not tolerated, but I do think in those cases that true information should be given to the child.   <br/>\n<br/>\nKaty J.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Sara McGrath&lt;mailto:msaraann@...&gt; <br/>\n  To: AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com&gt; <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, October 07, 2005 11:44 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] sugar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;The final product is table sugar.

Modern<br/>\ntechnology has largely replaced bone char decolourisation but it is<br/>\nstill used in a few refineries so one cannot be categoric about<br/>\nrefined cane sugar being suitable for all people&#39;s points of view. It<br/>\nis not used in making white beet sugar and it is not used in making<br/>\nraw cane sugar.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere bone char is still used, it is prepared by almost incinerating<br/>\nanimal bones to leave activated carbon - a bit like making wood<br/>\ncharcoal. [The refiners did not and ordinarily do not use wood<br/>\ncharcoal to do the decolourisation because it is too fragile and would<br/>\nbreak up in service.] The bones are obtained from abattoirs and hence<br/>\nfrom animals fit for human consumption and of course they are heated<br/>\nto great temperatures : there is no risk of New Variant CJD/BSE/Mad<br/>\nCow disease and no risk of Foot and Mouth disease.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are concerned about the possibility of the sugar you use having<br/>\nbeen treated by bone char decolourisation then you have several<br/>\nchoices. If you want white sugar and sugar from sugar beets is<br/>\navailable then use that. If you are not sure if the local sugar is<br/>\nfrom beets or cane, write to the manufacturer and ask them, adding<br/>\nthat, if it is cane sugar, whether they still use bone char. If you<br/>\nwant brown sugar, do not assume that it is inherently untreated. Many<br/>\nbrown sugars are actually white sugar which has been coated with<br/>\nmolasses.
