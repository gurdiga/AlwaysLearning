And we&#39;re all going to fail as we try to<br/>\nput better tools into practice.

Is this a real situation for you, or still a hypothetical reading of<br/>\nthat other woman? How does having an expectation of being mean, impatient or<br/>\nsnippy help anyone come to unschooling? <br/>\n<br/>\nI know one thing that Sandra would suggest if she were here and you shared<br/>\nthat these feelings came upon you. &quot;Breathe - slow deep calming breaths&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nOur focus is on helping people *not* act out on these feelings in this type<br/>\nof difficult situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Anyway, I think it&#39;s important to remember that there are reasons for <br/>\nbehaviors and that the reasons are sometimes reasonable or at least not <br/>\nevil.

It sure<br/>\nis hot/busy/tiring here today isn&#39;t it?&quot; Then the girl could have gotten a<br/>\ndrink while you watched the buggy. Or if there were paper cups at the<br/>\nfountain, as there sometimes are, you could have brought the girl a drink,<br/>\nand said something kind about how grown up she was to be so responsible with<br/>\nher siblings, or some other thing uplifiting that doesn&#39;t sound so lame.<br/>\nHindsight is so 20/20.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
