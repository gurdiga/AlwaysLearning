Beginners were sent to another group called Unschooling Basics.  This was only for people who already had experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a time when AOL’s forums were VERY busy.  There was another time when, for a few years, a long-defunct message board that Home Education Magazine had set up just to keep unschoolers out of the way of “regular homeschoolers” was VERY rich and busy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen for a while, yahoogroups.  <br/>\nThere were four or five, good, solid, for unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, though, the busy venue is facebook, and there are no good walls or barriers (for an open group)—people post recklessly, loosely, and irresponsibly, thinking “it’s just facebook.”  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis group used to be open (visible to anyone) and I wanted it that way, but when yahoogroups was revamped and I was exploring the new appearance of the moderators’ “back room,” I clicked something I shoud not have, and an open group became a closed group, which is (apparently) undoable.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThat matters little to anyone but me.  Because another reality in 2016 is that there is more material available, well-chosen, static, than were was on any of those forums I’ve named above, in their prime.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I’m tired.  Once in a while I’m moved to explain things, show people behind the curtain, a plant tour, and explain (again) that really, truly, I’m not keeping statistic, people come and go, some of the greatest unschoolers might never once have posted a single word, and that’s fine.  Some who’ve posted quite a bit end up with kids in school.  The outcomes are not tracked, not graded, not certified.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I want to protect is the quality of the information provided, so I’m glad this was posted:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-If others want to write about other types of living, they should do it elsewhere.

I am really and truly grateful for having become lighter, less negative, more grateful, patient, kinder gentler, more mindful.....the list goes on and on. What matters, to me, is that our family is healthy and whole, that we are real people who can live in a way which is more peaceful and more harmonious and that brings us joy- the real purpose of living is not a checklist to be completed but to enjoy our lives, to love one another and support each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf others want to write about other types of living, they should do it elsewhere.

What I got from her comment was that others should do as you have and throw off the labels and do as you have by blogging about mission statements and goals – the personal stuff rather than blogging about their efforts to fit into certain labels.”<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps literal surfing was involved.  Melissa lives in San Diego. :-)<br/>\nMaybe the question in that commenter’s mind was honestly which group the family could most comfortably hang out with socially.  Because honestly, if an unschooled kid showed up at the Waldorf surfing meet-up, how many ways could he break their magic?  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat post isn’t at all new; that’s not the point.  But people who think that somehow they will be “in trouble” if they aren’t pure unschoolers might feel better.   Feeling better isn’t an invitation to post advice here that will harm others’ understanding of unschooling, though.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76971,"nextTopicId":76970}}
