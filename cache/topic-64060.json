I got sick shortly after I wrote this question and then things got hectic here at home so I&#39;m just now getting to the replies. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn thing I noticed about my original post was that the the word &quot;betrayed&quot; wasn&#39;t my own. I read it and heard others use it and I assumed it would apply to my situation but it probably wouldn&#39;t. My kiddo and I have a great relationship and he&#39;s a pretty smart cookie already processing all the clues. I don&#39;t think it would be the dire situation I witnessed last year when my neighbor&#39;s told their 11 year old the Easter bunny wasn&#39;t real. He wouldn&#39;t speak to them for days. I don&#39;t know for sure but since the presents and the fantasy are what my kiddo loves about Santa and since those wouldn&#39;t go away, I don&#39;t think he&#39;d be &quot;angry.&quot; We&#39;ve discussed things like Jack Frost and Batman in similar conversations. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do think I&#39;ll play things down on my end and follow his lead more. Neither making any blatant falsehoods but playing along when he wants me to. I think his version of what makes Santa real might have another alternative than my black and white he is or isn&#39;t perspective. He told me the other day Santa wasn&#39;t a person he just was, after he told me the mall Santas were not the real Santa. He would be scared/worried to think of a grown man breaking in so he seems to have a special category for this type of thing. (like batman and jack frost)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow I wanted to pop in and say Thank You! I got a lot of good ideas and gained a lot of perspective regarding my own situation. I do wish I had starting things a bit differently but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s anything that can&#39;t be dealt with in a sensitive manner when the time comes. <br/>\n<br/>\nside note: the song &quot;Mommy Kissing Santa Claus&quot; came on the radio today and while we didn&#39;t discuss it I could see the little wheels in his head turning. I am constantly amazed at what such young kids are taking in and processing. I know this is awful but as an only child with limited interactions, it wasn&#39;t until I became a parent that I realized how whole they really are. Not children who don&#39;t know any better at all!

It IS a<br/>\nreligious book of course, but it mostly focuses on St. Nicholas and what<br/>\nhe did.<br/>\nWhen my daughter was about 6 or 7, she asked me if we could leave out<br/>\ncookies and milk for Santa.  &quot;I know he isn&#39;t real&quot; she states, &quot;but I<br/>\njust want to pretend he is.  I thought that was perfectly fine so we<br/>\nmade some cookies especially for Santa each year since then and either<br/>\nher dad or I would eat a couple or take bites out of them and drink the<br/>\nmilk.

I don&#39;t think they introduced the idea, or played it up too much, but they played along with our ideas, and it was fun. The biggest gifts, like bikes, were always from Santa.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was around five or six, I started thinking harder about it and decided that each family had its own Santa, and mine was my grandfather. He always came to visit us at Christmas, after all! It was a fun way to continue the game without believing that one guy could visit the home of every Christmas-celebrating family in the world in one night. That evolved into a belief, as others on this thread have said, that Santa is a state of being that anyone can take part in. When I was a teenager, I started working with my little sister to stuff our parents&#39; stockings, which rocked my dad&#39;s world a little (he always wanted to be the last to the stockings so his gifts would be surprises), but he played along.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I&#39;m mom to a 7-year-old daughter and a 3-year-old son, my husband and I do Santa -- playing along with our kids&#39; ideas, as long as they are playing happily rather than asking us questions -- with the we-are-all-Santa model in the backs of our minds. A year or two ago, when my daughter (now 7) started asking me point-blank if Santa was real, those are the thoughts I shared with her. Not &quot;No,&quot; but &quot;Here&#39;s how I think about it.&quot; A happy side effect of this gentle transition is that my daughter is able to let my son have his years of believing in Santa, without spoiling his fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short: We play along and don&#39;t tell unless asked; and we have our fallback (our real beliefs about generosity as a human quality) ready to explain in kid-friendly terms when we are asked.<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy Holidays!<br/>\nDeborah</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Santa","postDate":"1322945801","msgId":64074,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpiZTJlOStqYm51QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PENBT2V1M0FnYVJSUFBPaGVBK3RPc1c1PXJVWWhyPU01N3RoPTVxMm1lRWQxWlhYVVNDUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":64073,"nextInTopic":64075,"prevInTime":64073,"nextInTime":64075,"topicId":64060,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

They actively did things to make it look like Santa had visited and told stories of hearing noises on the roof or just missing seeing him. I don&#39;t think my younger brother bought it all as long as I did, but I definitely felt betrayed when I found out it had all been an elaborate lie. I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s suggesting doing that (I hope not!) but wanted to point out that some people Do feel betrayed and bring a good bit of baggage to this subject. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think there&#39;s a joy and wonder and spirit of giving that comes with<br/>\n&gt; Santa.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For some there can be, but kids are different. Some take things more seriously than others. Some fall right in with the game. Some catch on to the whole &quot;spirit of giving&quot; thing and see Santa as part of that. Some get their feelings hurt and end up bitter about it. <br/>\n<br/>\nKids find joy and wonder in the world whether or not you create fantasies for them. They create their own, sometimes, and at others they marvel at the world without needing any more than bare bones reality. Sometimes parents resist that kind of wonder - the kind that comes from admiring a sleek piece of plastic or an ordinary bit of gravel - but kids, especially little kids, have a marvelous capacity for awe. They don&#39;t mind a bit of fantasy, but they don&#39;t need it to know the world is miraculous, so long as they have lots of opportunities to be joyful and to wonder without being told &quot;stop that, put it down, come here, don&#39;t dawdle, you don&#39;t want that, that&#39;s nothing special.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nOne year, Mo got all excited about the idea it would snow for xmas. I suppose she saw all the cards and tv specials and displays and magazines and thought snow was automatic for the day. We live in Tennessee and I think it&#39;s snowed once on xmas in the last 20years. We get snow in late January, but not for xmas. I tried to gently warn her, but she wasn&#39;t interested. She&#39;d seen the literature: xmas meant snow. So when it didn&#39;t snow that year xmas officially was a disaster as far as Morgan was concerned. My little girl spent the day in tears because the world had not lived up to her expectations. It was a sad day, but it didn&#39;t ruin xmas or winter or snow forever. She didn&#39;t lose her ability to wonder and dance in the snow. <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople get all wound up about Santa and &quot;making&quot; the day special, as if a day of fun and presents and fancy food and toys stuffed into socks wasn&#39;t special enough. Santa can be a fun game or a sweet metaphor, but you don&#39;t need a magic visitor to make a day lovely, and the absence of one doesn&#39;t ruin that day forever. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Santa","postDate":"1322945357","msgId":64073,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxQTEyQkUwLUYzQjQtNDE0My1CNEM0LTI3QkJBNTA5MDNGQkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBT09UYVhONjBjYVZaVVlkV1QrVFl5N2pCaSs3RTVlNCt3dWhOLVU3LWRoa1hHVEhyUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDAzRDlDOEFDLUQ5NDAtNDE5Ny05QzQyLTQ2ODM0MDdERDUyNUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPGpiZHQ1NCtvaDE3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8Q0FPT1RhWE42MGNhVlpVWWRXVCtUWXk3akJpKzdFNWU0K3d1aE4tVTctZGhrWEdUSHJRQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64072,"nextInTopic":64074,"prevInTime":64072,"nextInTime":64074,"topicId":64060,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-If I had a kid like the original poster described, who really questions what is exactly true or not, I wouldn t try to mislead, but would treat it like a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2101552049\">-=-If I had a kid like the original poster described, who really questions<br/>\nwhat is exactly true or not, I wouldn&#39;t try to mislead, but would treat it<br/>\nlike a really fun and wonderful pretend game.

Whatever was in or near the stocking (unwrapped) was &quot;a Santa present&quot; and wrapped gifts were marked from mom and dad or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never elaborated on any stories, and never lied.  I would read books to them but they didn&#39;t consider Santa to be more or less real than Bert and Ernie, or Ninja Turtles.  I read nativity books, too.

For those that think otherwise I wonder if they pause movies or interrupt a child reading a book to remind them it’s all fake? <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my children were little we didn’t “do” Santa but we didn’t “not do” Santa either. I don’t remember signing anything from Santa though Jeff may have and other family members most certainly did. I didn’t call him a liar. I didn’t call the family members liars. I just read the tags when they could not allowed for them to come to their own conclusions. We watched Christmas shows with them.

So my kids knew always that there is no real Santa - as in a<br/>\nreal person who lives at the North Pole, etc. That never stopped them from<br/>\nenjoying the whole make-believe thing. Somehow they never once conveyed to<br/>\nany other kid that Santa wasn&#39;t totally a real person, because they so<br/>\neasily and happily went along with all the make-believe. They thought it<br/>\nwas a little odd but also kind of sweet when they&#39;d realize that another<br/>\nkid actually thought it was all absolutely true. They&#39;d confide quietly to<br/>\nme, &quot;I think so-and-so thinks Santa is real, Mommy.&quot; And I knew they were<br/>\nbeing careful not to &quot;break the spell.&quot; But - they spent a LOT of time<br/>\npretending lots of fictional things were real - this was just more<br/>\npretend-play to them - and it was very extensive and imaginative and<br/>\ngrown-ups were playing too! Cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember my nephew asking me point blank if I thought Santa was real. I<br/>\nsmiled and kept a twinkle in my eye and said something like, &quot;I just don&#39;t<br/>\nknow, I guess you have to figure that out for yourself!&quot; He immediately<br/>\nsaid, emphatically, &quot;I think he is!&quot; I smiled and nodded and said, &quot;Cool!&quot;<br/>\nI have heard of MANY kids taking this approach - they might deep inside<br/>\nknow it is pretend, but they choose to live as though they totally believe<br/>\nit - because it is FUN.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see anything wrong with taking this approach from the beginning. My<br/>\nfamily talked about fictional characters as if they were real all the time.<br/>\nAnne Shirley (Anne of Green Gables), for example, was discussed all the<br/>\ntime as if she was a real person. So were Star Trek characters. Santa fit<br/>\nright in! I don&#39;t think parents should go out of their way to try to make<br/>\nthe kids believe there really is a man living at the North Pole with his<br/>\nwife and bunch of elves, etc. I was at the soccer field one day when a dad<br/>\nwas telling a young child - maybe 5 years old - &quot;You&#39;d better believe in<br/>\nSanta or he won&#39;t bring you presents.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had a kid like the original poster described, who really questions<br/>\nwhat is exactly true or not, I wouldn&#39;t try to mislead, but would treat it<br/>\nlike a really fun and wonderful pretend game.

There must be some kind middle ground...one of motivated by joy, love, caring, play and imagination. <br/>\nPlayful games of imagination – like stories of Santa- are hardly the worst “lies” told to children and most certainly not worst injustice. For those that think otherwise I wonder if they pause movies or interrupt a child reading a book to remind them it’s all fake? <br/>\nWhen my children were little we didn’t “do” Santa but we didn’t “not do” Santa either. I don’t remember signing anything from Santa though Jeff may have and other family members most certainly did. I didn’t call him a liar. I didn’t call the family members liars. I just read the tags when they could not allowed for them to come to their own conclusions. We watched Christmas shows with them. I read Christmas stories to them, including ones about Jesus (despite being agnostic myself). I never told them Santa existed nor did I tell them he didn’t...until they asked me. <br/>\nI think handling things in this way helped my relationship with my kids in other areas. I remember one year we had a blast following Santa’s journey –as a family- on the Weather Channel despite being well past the point of “Is Santa real?” We just watched the progress reports and played along – as a family. <br/>\nKelly <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265904721,"authorName":"MaryB","from":"&quot;MaryB&quot; &lt;bautmama@...&gt;","profile":"bautmama","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Santa","postDate":"1322940388","msgId":64069,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpiZHQ1NCtvaDE3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAzRDlDOEFDLUQ5NDAtNDE5Ny05QzQyLTQ2ODM0MDdERDUyNUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":64065,"nextInTopic":64070,"prevInTime":64068,"nextInTime":64070,"topicId":64060,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My two cents on the topic...

We do not celebrate for any religious reasons, this is just fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Santa, we believe...we all do because Santa is not a single person to our family but a &quot;feeling&quot; a special kindness shared between people. One of the classic Christmas claymations has Mrs. Claus dancing about singing ...anyone can be Santa anybody at all...and we grabbed onto that idea and ran with it many years ago when our oldest was a baby. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince anyone can be Santa my kids see every kindness as &quot;that person is being Santa&quot; and they love the whole secret Santa thing, giving a warm blanket to an elderly neighbor wrapped up in a bow on their porch, sneaking to take down trash cans on trash day for the new mom around the block. My kids love giving gifts to friends and family, they love that they can be the gift giver and be part of the &quot;magic.&quot; As the parents, my spouse and I also LOOK to see the magic everywhere, a kind person that offers my children a mint to distract them for a moment in the grocery store line because there is only one little cashier working and the line goes on for miles. (Well, Hello Santa) A friend, that did not even know we wanted to go see a family member, offers to watch our pets so we can go visiting over night. An unexpected and forgotten refund check coming in the mail that allowed us to get a Christmas gift for our kids the year we where out of work. If you want to believe in Santa or kindness shared it is easy to see it everywhere. We choose to believe. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo for my two cents...I ask why say NO, why say no there is no Santa, when instead you can say YES and isn&#39;t it WONDERFUL!  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Because, anyone can be Santa, yes anybody at all...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(o:<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-It isn&#39;t too late to tell him the truth.

In the past I&#39;ve asked my kids &quot;do you want this present now or wait until (xmas, birthday)?&quot; Sometimes they want to wait! Sometimes the wait is part of the fun. For a long trip, if I bought something especially for the ride I&#39;d generally get something to give right away. Now that Mo&#39;s 10, I can tell her &quot;I&#39;m getting this for the trip, so you have something to do in the car&quot; and she understands - she&#39;s been on trips before, after all. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;It&#39;s tough to surprise him.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t have to surprise him, necessarily. Some people associate gift giving with surprises, but they don&#39;t have to be part of the same thing. If he likes to be surprised, there are other ways to play with surprise without tying it to holidays and gifts. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I worry that he&#39;ll ask me about him and I&#39;m not sure what I would say. He seems to really want to believe him to be real.

Would He like to give a &quot;Santa gift&quot; to someone? Keep away from &quot;do you believe in Santa?&quot; unless he brings it up - its a Loaded question! Little kids ask it of each other in tense voices which suggest there&#39;s a Right Answer and he may have picked up on that, but you don&#39;t have to play along.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut also know that some kids will Believe even if you say &quot;nope, Santa&#39;s not real&quot; and they get no santa presents at all! Mo was like that for awhile. It&#39;s like Believing is more important than the object of the belief to some kids, for awhile. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Santa","postDate":"1322924743","msgId":64063,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAzRDlDOEFDLUQ5NDAtNDE5Ny05QzQyLTQ2ODM0MDdERDUyNUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMjI5MTg2OTQuODI2NzEuWWFob29NYWlsQ2xhc3NpY0B3ZWIxNjE3MDIubWFpbC5iZjEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDEzMjI5MTg2OTQuODI2NzEuWWFob29NYWlsQ2xhc3NpY0B3ZWIxNjE3MDIubWFpbC5iZjEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64062,"nextInTopic":64064,"prevInTime":64062,"nextInTime":64064,"topicId":64060,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-It isn t too late to tell him the truth.
