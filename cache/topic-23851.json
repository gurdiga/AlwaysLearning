LOL!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI posted a few of the negative traits, and I certainly hate to give the impression that those <br/>\ntraits are what we focus on in our home. That&#39;s far from the truth! In fact, we are focussed <br/>\non what each of our children are capable of doing and what they are interested in, so that <br/>\nwe can build on those skills and help them become more comfortable in the world. If it <br/>\nwasn&#39;t for Breanna&#39;s trouble in the ps, I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d ever reached the point that I <br/>\ndid. Because we don&#39;t qualify for any assistance and our insurance covers no therapy, I was <br/>\ndoing all of her therapy myself. And it came to the point where I suddenly realized <br/>\n(epiphany  moment) that school is not helping my children, it&#39;s hurting them...the <br/>\nprofessionals know no more than I do about my children and their &#39;disAbilities&#39;...and what <br/>\nthey needed was to be home with people who love them, care about them, and can <br/>\nhonestly say that they were available to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been keeping our kids out of stressful settings. However, that&#39;s not always <br/>\nfunctional. What we have done is keep track of what they are capable of, and adjust. <br/>\nBreanna loves the mall, just not with people in it. So we get up early and go when it&#39;s just <br/>\nthe elderly walkers. She likes to buy groceries, but cannot walk through the front door at <br/>\nWalmart...so we go to other stores OR if I&#39;m really hankering for the deal on apples, we&#39;ll <br/>\nenter and exit through automotive. She loves McD&#39;s french fries, so that&#39;s incentive <br/>\nenough to deal with obnoxious screaming toddlers. ;-) Slowly she&#39;s making her own <br/>\nsupports to deal with things she doesn&#39;t like, so she can do what she likes. What&#39;s more <br/>\nfunctional than that? <br/>\n<br/>\nI am so glad for parents who get *it* early. It took so many wasted years for me to <br/>\nunderstand that my kids should be at home where they are comfortable. Same with the <br/>\npotty training, aparenting, etc...why did it take me so many kids to understand?  Well, <br/>\nwe&#39;re going to the store to buy more glycerin and molds for soap.

He didn&#39;t understand why he <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t handle noises like other people, crowds like others, he couldn&#39;t finish a project no <br/>\nmatter how hard he tried. He was always the first person to need to leave a party. His <br/>\ncommunication skills had strangers concerned, he had people turn around and walk away <br/>\nwhile he was talking. He had a lot of anger and depression that he was internalizing. <br/>\nKnowing a name for his difference made a huge difference for him. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor Breanna&#39;s siblings, it made a difference for them because her behaviors scared them <br/>\n(or made them angry when she ruins their toys or we skip a party or such).

I know you know this but before I wrote<br/>\nanother word, I wanted to be clear that I think this is key.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have four children. I knew that two of them were in a different place than<br/>\n*most* children &quot;developmentally&quot;. It truly didn&#39;t matter because we weren&#39;t<br/>\nin situations that judged kids, or categorized them, like in a classroom. If<br/>\nyou are considering unschooling now at your son&#39;s young age, there probably<br/>\nis no need to get a diagnosis for him (and it is VERY easy to get diagnoses<br/>\nin general, so trusting the diagnosis is another story too). Stay in the<br/>\nmoment with him and see where he shines. That is what he will really need.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the question is why do you want a diagnosis.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are looking for a pool of information that may help you unlock some<br/>\nways to best facilitate the best life possible for your son, then maybe you<br/>\ncould google some of his traits and see what comes up. You would be doing<br/>\nthis for YOU, to see if there are things you hadn&#39;t thought of for your<br/>\nparticular guy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you find something that seems to fit,  I would recommend never for a<br/>\nsecond disconnecting from your son with the thought that &quot;there is something<br/>\nwrong with him&quot;. As has been said, we are all different in a gazillion ways,<br/>\nand there is little to nothing wrong with most of us, even though some of us<br/>\ncould fall under some diagnosis.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, it is much easier for me to communicate with some people about my<br/>\nson using the term &quot;autistic&quot;. It eliminates having to go through a myriad<br/>\nof personality traits that are common with most autistic folks, and takes me<br/>\na much shorter time to move on to whatever the point of the communication<br/>\nis. If you find that your son has similar characteristics to some diagnosis,<br/>\nthen it may help in communication sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would not convey a label to your son. It wasn&#39;t until my oldest was 15<br/>\nthat we ever said the word &quot;autistic&quot; TO him. He knew something was very<br/>\n&quot;different&quot; about him from his friends, he had all these struggles that he<br/>\nsaw his siblings and *friends* (he didn&#39;t really have bona fide friends till<br/>\nthis year...he thought if he knew someone, they were his friend...he&#39;s 17<br/>\nnow)and he asked questions of us. My husband, who had himself evaluated for<br/>\nhis own sanity when he was 50 or so, thought ds would appreciate having<br/>\ninformation about Asperger&#39;s. So it kinda came from my son, when we actually<br/>\nshared a label with him...not give him a label perse, but shared information<br/>\nwith him. And it turned out to be a good thing for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I recommend being very conscientious of what you do with a label or<br/>\ndiagnosis...it shouldn&#39;t be a downer in any way, just a way to get more<br/>\ninformation, or in some cases, to get services from the state. And at some<br/>\npoint, it may help your son in getting information as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t edited this email like I usually do, but wanted to get this out<br/>\nbefore I had to run with one of my guys.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nJacki<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>]On Behalf Of Jo<br/>\nSent: Sunday, January 08, 2006 4:02 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Labeling (was lots of input)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes a label can be helpful so that a parent doesn&#39;t get worried<br/>\nwhen a child&#39;s peers can do x, y, or z and child doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I have a child (age 4 1/2) who seems to be &quot;behind&quot; (for<br/>\nlack of a better term) his peers and kids younger than him and I&#39;m<br/>\ntrying to figure out if there is something different about him and if<br/>\nthere is something I can do to make things easier for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far, it&#39;s not totally holding him back.

When she went, she was five months  <br/>\npregnant.

He can  <br/>\nknow what time he needs to be somewhere, and what he needs to wear,  <br/>\nand not figure out that he needs to start the laundry early enough  <br/>\nand not tell someone else he can meet them during the same time he&#39;s  <br/>\nalready committed to be elsewhere.  Pretty much, someone has to  <br/>\norganize his life for him, or he just gets more and more entangled in  <br/>\nhis own incompetence.

I<br/>\nwent back and forth on that issue myself for years and<br/>\nfinally decided to settle somewhere in the middle.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the one hand, I *hate* labels, and I don&#39;t think<br/>\nyou can define people that way.  On the other hand,<br/>\nlabels do exist, and there are some that do define us<br/>\n(Mom, Unschooler, wife/partner, writer, are a few of<br/>\nmine) but any one label does not define us wholly and<br/>\nnever can.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the one hand a parent may not want to limit and box<br/>\nin their kids, socially isolate them, make them feel<br/>\ndefective or the other possible pitfalls of labels. <br/>\nOn the other hand, having a child with challenges is<br/>\nexhausting and really hard, and already socially<br/>\nisolates you, and being able to have a common label<br/>\nthat helps connect you to others who are supportive<br/>\nand understanding of those challenges is a great<br/>\nbenefit.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the one hand these developmental labels in<br/>\nparticular are tricky, the things they define are<br/>\npoorly understood and how they are defined and<br/>\ndiagnosed varies by region, and kids are subject to<br/>\nchange as they grow in unpredictable ways and so find<br/>\nthat previous labels don&#39;t seem to apply anymore.  On<br/>\nthe other hand, without labels officiated by a<br/>\ndiagnosis therapies and many other things that hugely<br/>\nassist these kids are just not available to us.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our home we don&#39;t see our kids differences (or our<br/>\nown) as handicaps or negatives.  We embrace the word<br/>\n&quot;Autism&quot; as a part of our individual and family<br/>\nidentity, and I certainly know other adult autistics<br/>\nwho feel/do the same.  We recognize the possible<br/>\nlimiting factors or areas where we need to address<br/>\nchallenges as simply a part of us.  I would no more<br/>\ndeny that I am short and slight of build or pale<br/>\nskinned than to deny the part &quot;autism&quot; (or whatever<br/>\ncatchphrase can be used to describe that vast and<br/>\ncomplex collection of behaviors and differences) plays<br/>\nin who I am or who my children are.  Denial is no more<br/>\nhelpful or healthy or beneficial in my opinion than<br/>\nslapping a label on my forehead and allowing that to<br/>\ndefine me wholly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas says He&#39;s &quot;artistic&quot; which is how he pronounces<br/>\nautistic.  He will sometimes pick up on someone else&#39;s<br/>\nbehaviors and say &quot;Is he artistic like me?&quot;  Sometimes<br/>\nit&#39;s in person or other times in movies/shows.  Two<br/>\nrecent examples are the character Sam (Johnny Depp) in<br/>\nthe movie Benny and Joon and the chracter William<br/>\nForrester (Sean Connery) in the movie Finding<br/>\nForester.  They both seem to obviously be high<br/>\nfunctioning autistic to those of us who live and<br/>\nbreath it every day.  So does Johnny Depp&#39;s portrayal<br/>\nof Willy Wonka (which we love!) and Johnny Depp<br/>\nhimself for that matter, based on interviews I&#39;ve seen<br/>\nand his many movie roles.  So does the cast of the tv<br/>\nshow Third Rock From the Sun.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, Thomas proudly tells people he&#39;s<br/>\n&quot;artistic&quot; just as he proudly shares the names of the<br/>\nfamily pets, or talks about his movies or other<br/>\npassions.
