But the main reason I wanted to mention this is because I know there are critics of unschooling who assume that children allowed freedom of choice to follow their own interests whatever they might be will automatically have difficulties adjusting to the demands of &quot;the real world&quot; when the time comes. So I thought I would mention that Pat&#39;s transition from videogaming night owl to conscientious college student was as smooth as silk. He was interested in doing something that required him to change his habits so he changed his habits, of his own volition, and has adapted almost effortlessly to his new and different way of life.
