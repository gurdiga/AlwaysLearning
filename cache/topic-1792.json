Well, I have a lot of favourite movies... not the least of <br/>\nwhich are musicals that have been put on video, such as Cats or Jesus Christ <br/>\nSuperstar (I don&#39;t mean the movie, I mean the recent Really Useful video. <br/>\nActually, the movie&#39;s good too, but I find the RU vid much more to my taste). <br/>\nAlfred Hitchcock films are great, esp. Rope, which is my personal favourite - <br/>\na murder mystery where the first scene is the murder, and you know the whole <br/>\nway through who the killers are! <br/>\n<br/>\nI love &#39;psychological thrillers&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also really like Labyrinth, for a good fantasy movie, and hey! It, too, is <br/>\nmusical! <br/>\n<br/>\nSunset Boulevard is one of my all-time favourite movies. It&#39;s fabulous and <br/>\ninteresting and I would love it even if it hadn&#39;t been converted into a <br/>\nmusical by Andrew Lloyd Webber (I can see a definite pattern here...). But <br/>\nthe movie is the original, black & white version, not the ALW musical.<br/>\n<br/>\nJurassic Park is another great film. The makers of it did an impressive job <br/>\nof retaining what&#39;s good about the book -- namely, the plot and <br/>\n&#39;technobabble&#39; -- whilst changing the characters just enough so that they&#39;re <br/>\nmore interesting to watch onscreen. If there&#39;s one problem with JP-the-book, <br/>\nit&#39;s that the characters are unlikable and more than a little 2-dimensional. <br/>\nBut the plot is fantastic, and that&#39;s what makes the movie great.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Roxana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":818735,"authorName":"Joylyn","from":"Joylyn &lt;joylyn@...&gt;","profile":"joylynrsf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"movies","postDate":"1009603377","msgId":1792,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDMkQ1MzMxLjc0NzIyMDNAZ3RlLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGM2LjQyNDM0OTcuMjk1ZWExYWZAY3MuY29tPiA8M0MyRDRDNjMuODU2NTNBMDRAaXgubmV0Y29tLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":1795,"prevInTime":1791,"nextInTime":1793,"topicId":1792,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I LOVE Princess Bride.
