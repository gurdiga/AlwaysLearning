I got maybe a couple of chapters into it before it just felt too awful for me to read. I am sure that Sandra is right, I am sure that she is talking about ideas that needed to be talked about.

Somehow removed from all the evil and nastiness that the rest of us more complicated folk live in. Ray Hames, who worked with the Yekwana, has a wonderful site on them, or he used to, at his pages at UNL (ah, he does still have it <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unl.edu/rhames/)\">http://www.unl.edu/rhames/)</a>. Actually, looking over at Ray&#39;s pages he has a recent paper on the noble savage idea as expressed in regards to sustainable development (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unl.edu/rhames/ms/savage-prepub.pdf&#92;)\">http://www.unl.edu/rhames/ms/savage-prepub.pdf&#92;)</a>.  They are just folk. They have this horrible master/slave relationship with the Yananomo, they aren&#39;t always nice, they aren&#39;t more<br/>\n altruistic than anybody else. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat was what kept me from reading the Continuum Concept. That was why when I bought it I added to my amazon order a book by an evolutionary ecologist. I suppose one of my other problems is that it sets up a real sense of dissatisfaction with the world we live in, a sense that another world, another life would be a better one. Or that we aren&#39;t as good as we could be if we lived a life more close to the life we had 10,000 years ago, before agriculture. But I love the internet, and I love the immediacy of my life. I love having pinto beans for dinner in the UK in the middle of winter. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Laureen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:splashing@...\">splashing@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Monday, 21 January, 2008 4:10:02 PM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Leidloff?
