I got it at the library because Zach likes to watch stuff blow up and is a gun nut.  Also dh&#39;s grandparents lived very close to there.  We talked, shushed each other, asked and answered questions.  Adriane was highly incensed that women weren&#39;t allowed combat duty which took us off in an entirely different direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also watched &quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot; the other night.  Adriane is still talking about the movie and all the restrictions placed on the Quakers.  She was able to relate it to some children she knows whose parents are fundamentalists.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Give government the weapons to fight your enemy and it will use them against you&quot;--Harry Browne<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety&quot;--Benjamin Franklin<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable&quot;-- John F.
