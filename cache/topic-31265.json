I&#39;m having an internal argument about it and<br/>\nI would like to talk with others who have probably already been<br/>\nthrough the same thing. Anyhow I have a 9yo who we have been life<br/>\nlearning with for about 4 years now, most of the time things are great<br/>\nand I think we&#39;re both doing well. We talk and share as much as<br/>\npossible in the time we have. I work part-time but my dh is thankfully<br/>\non board with unschooling and they spend more time together when I&#39;m<br/>\nat work. <br/>\n<br/>\n    What I have problems with is how much of the reminding or<br/>\nprompting should I be doing with him. For example after dinner I see<br/>\nhim walking straight to the computer and I may prompt with something<br/>\nlike &quot;you might want to wash your hands to keep any grease (or ketchup<br/>\nusually) from getting the keyboard icky&quot;, or if I see that he&#39;s tired<br/>\nand getting ready for bed I say something like &quot;do you want me to put<br/>\ntoothpaste on your toothbrush so it will be ready for you?&quot; as a<br/>\nreminder to brush his teeth. I try not to remind about the teeth every<br/>\nday, I&#39;m hoping sometime he will take over and remember himself but<br/>\nI&#39;m not seeing that happen yet. Same thing with the hand washing he&#39;s<br/>\nnot remembering it on his own yet. As I write this out I realize I am<br/>\nwanting him to remember these things on his own, perhaps am I wanting<br/>\ntoo much out of him too soon, and when he is ready he will do these<br/>\nthings on his own? <br/>\n<br/>\n      I try not to prompt or remind unless it&#39;s something I really<br/>\nfeel is worth saying. For example a lot of days he forgets to brush<br/>\nhis hair but I only mention it if we&#39;re going out somewhere. Am I<br/>\ndoing the right thing with these occasional reminders? We do talk<br/>\nabout these things at other times he just hasn&#39;t caught on yet that he<br/>\nneeds to be the one responsible for doing them? Is there something<br/>\nbetter I could be doing? And I should note that when i do make a<br/>\nprompt he is almost always happy to comply. (That he is not just<br/>\ngrowing dependent on me to remind him of these things? Is that the<br/>\nschooly thought I am trying to get out of my head, or is that the<br/>\nproblem I&#39;m having is that he&#39;d too dependent on me to remind him?)<br/>\n<br/>\n    I have given up on his nail biting, he is like his dad and does it<br/>\nin his sleep, it&#39;s not a voluntary thing on his part so I let it go<br/>\nbut I am unhappy inside that his nails will probably always look<br/>\nterrible like his dads for the rest of his life, but I married his dad<br/>\nanyway :) We have talked about it several times, about things he could<br/>\ntry, trying to let him come up with his own solutions. But I don&#39;t say<br/>\nanything to him about it anymore as I figure if it is under his<br/>\ncontrol he will fix it eventually, that I would only be putting<br/>\nunnecessary stress on him by saying something. So I&#39;m not sure it I&#39;m<br/>\ndoing the right thing there either.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31271,"nextTopicId":31295}}
