I got a chuckle or two.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, rules that support my method?.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Ten Rules of Housekeeping<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Vacuuming too often weakens the carpet fibers. Say this with a serious<br/>\nface,<br/>\nand shudder delicately whenever anyone mentions Carpet Fresh.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Layers of dirty film on windows and screens provide a helpful filter<br/>\nagainst<br/>\nharmful and aging rays from the sun. Call it an SPF factor of 5 and leave it<br/>\nalone.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Dust bunnies should never be disturbed. Rename the area under the couch<br/>\n&quot;The<br/>\nGal√°pagos Islands&quot; and claim an ecological exemption.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Cobwebs artfully draped over lampshades reduces the glare from the bulb,<br/>\nthereby creating a romantic atmosphere. If your husband points out that the<br/>\nlight fixtures need<br/>\ndusting, simply look affronted and exclaim, &quot;What? And spoil the mood?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n5. In a pinch, you can always claim that the haphazard tower of unread<br/>\nmagazines and newspapers next to your chair provides the valuable Feng Shui<br/>\naspect of a tiger, thereby reducing your vulnerability. Roll your eyes when<br/>\nyou<br/>\nsay it, as though EVERYONE knowsthis.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. If dusting is really out of control, simply place a showy urn on the<br/>\ncoffee<br/>\ntable and insist, &quot;This is where Aunt Hazel wanted us to scatter her ashes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n7. If unexpected company is coming, pile everything unsightly into one room<br/>\nand<br/>\nclose the door. As you show your guests through your tidy home, rattle the<br/>\ndoor<br/>\nknob vigorously, fake a growl and say, &quot;I&#39;d love you to see our den, but<br/>\nFluffy<br/>\nhates to be disturbed and the shots are SO expensive.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n8. Explain the mound of pet hair brushed up against the doorways by claiming<br/>\nyou are collecting it there to use for stuffing hand-sewn play animals for<br/>\nunderprivileged children<br/>\n<br/>\n9. Don&#39;t bother repainting. Simply scribble lightly over a dirty wall with<br/>\nan<br/>\nassortment of crayons and try to muster a glint of tears as you say, &quot;Little<br/>\nJoey did this the week before that unspeakable accident... I haven&#39;t had the<br/>\nheart to clean it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n10. Mix one quarter cup pine-scented household cleanser with four cups of<br/>\nwater<br/>\nin a spray bottle. Mist the air lightly. Leave dampened rags in conspicuous<br/>\nlocations. Develop an exhausted look, throw yourself onto the couch, and<br/>\nsigh,<br/>\n&quot;I clean and I clean and I still don&#39;t get anywhere...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13282,"nextTopicId":13286}}
