He’s getting married in October.  Yesterday he sent me an account of the first time he and Destiny were together in a group outing, and he had decided he especially liked her.  I can’t share that, because it’s going out with their wedding-invitation packet (a non-traditional home-made set of things).  He sent me the first draft, to help him polish it.  There were a few places where two sentences needed to be one, and vice versa.  There was a place where phrasing was awkward.  Artistically, though—the imagery and sweetness and humor—it’s great writing.<br>\n<br>\nToday on facebook, Kirby posted this a facebook “a year ago today” that said “Started working at Kemtah, April 27, 2015.&quot;<br>\n____________<br>\n<br>\nApparently it&#39;s been a year. I&#39;m a Tier2 now, the two guys who trained me to do anything both got let go shortly after my first round of training.

He works on a contract providing  &quot;computer-desk” help for a large engineering firm (the one his dad worke for for so long, and has stock in).  <br>\n<br>\nKirby left Texas, and his good job with Blizzard Entertainment, to be nearer his family.  When he went to Texas, he thought it would be just a year or two, but it was nearly nine.  A little over two years ago, Kirby helped his girlfriend regain custody of her daughter (from the grandmother)—very long stories behind that involving harsh fundamentalist Christianity and alcohol, which is unfair combination, to need to deal with both).  Kirby found and paid for a lawyer, did a lot of driving and meetings, taking time off from work, to accomplish that change.  The girl was four, then, nearly five.

She calls Kirby “Kirby” to his face, but refers to him as “my dad.”  He has been the most reliable, calm, attentive person in her entire life thusfar.  It’s not an easy thing, to rescue people that way, but Kirby did it, and is doing it.<br>\n<br>\nWhen the three of them first moved here from Texas, they stayed with us for what ended up being seven or eight months (they moved out gradually, as they worked on that house).  I had recommended that they take a month or two to be tourists, so he could show Destiny and Devyn more of New Mexico, and they could relax a bit after their rough couple of years.  But he wanted to find a good job, and within about a month, he and Destiny both had jobs at Kemtah.  <br>\n<br>\nDestiny has been promoted too, and will soon be working in a different location (at Sandia Laboratories, on the air base, closer to their house).  <br>\n<br>\nOn weekends they do cool things together.  Devyn goes to a cheerleading academy owned by Marty (my younger son)’s wife’s sister, so they get a family discount.  Devyn doesn’t like the cheerleading, but takes a tumbling/gymnastics class that she DOES love.  They take her to the children’s museum and to parks, and buy her art supplies and play games with her.  Devyn’s life is hugely bigger, better, and safer.<br>\n<br>\nNot all men will help someone else in that way.   <br>\n<br>\nSometimes Kirby’s life is stressful, but he has ways to calm himself and to continue with hope and good intentions.<br>\n<br>\nHe makes more money than either my husband or I did at the age of 29 (even adjusting for inflation).
