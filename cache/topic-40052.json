In order<br/>\nto feel comfortable they would need some time away from the group each day.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nEvery year we go to a family reunion at my sister&#39;s house 3 hours away and<br/>\nwe always have a blast and they look forward to it each year.  We stay<br/>\nanywhere from 3 days to a full week.  Different years we have done different<br/>\nthings to deal with all of our need for down time.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSome years I&#39;ve felt able to afford a hotel room and we&#39;ve gone back in the<br/>\nafternoon and swam in the pool or had naps in the air conditioning.  For a<br/>\nfew years we had a pop up camper that we took and we could withdraw to it<br/>\nand play some board games or read quietly.  The last few years it hasn&#39;t<br/>\nbeen as much of an issue as the kids are older and more able to cope and<br/>\nalso they realize that the time to hang out with our whole family is limited<br/>\nand they want to get all they can before it&#39;s over.  But still, we reserve a<br/>\nbedroom in my sister&#39;s house and we all feel like we can retreat to it when<br/>\nwe need to.  Sometimes its just a matter of going on an excursion in the<br/>\nafternoon to regroup.  Popular destinations are the candy store and hiking.<br/>\nThis last summer we had our puppy with us and we would go walk him for an<br/>\nhour and that was enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nEven if you can not afford a hotel for the whole two week stay, you might<br/>\nwant to save so you can go for a night or two in the middle of the trip as a<br/>\ntime to recharge.  A pool is always a bonus too.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny C","from":"&quot;Jenny C&quot; &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: *10 How does unschooling teach the vital difference between needs and wants?","postDate":"1226694407","msgId":40247,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdma211NytjYm5qQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDBCMTlBNjVELTlEQUYtNDJDMS1BRkZFLUJGMDkzRDNCNjUwREBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":40241,"nextInTopic":40253,"prevInTime":40246,"nextInTime":40248,"topicId":40052,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

She feels it<br/>\ndemeans them as humans.  Part of it is also how narrow these girl&#39;s<br/>\ndefinition of beauty is.  She simply doesn&#39;t understand why there is<br/>\nseemingly only a small handful of boys that are deamed &quot;good looking&quot;<br/>\nwhile the rest are deamed &quot;ugly&quot;, and everyone seems to agree with one<br/>\nanother.<br/>\n<br/>\nChamille&#39;s aesthetic is more on the lines of liking or disliking various<br/>\ntypes of noses, but can generally find something extremely attractive<br/>\nabout every person she meets.  She doesn&#39;t like to talk about any of<br/>\nthat with these girls that she is friends with because of the judging<br/>\nand pettiness.  Right now, she&#39;s at a point of dismantling a few<br/>\nfriendships over this very thing.  She still talks to me about who she<br/>\nfinds attractive, but won&#39;t talk to these girls because they would never<br/>\nsee it.  She&#39;s not aged biased either, she finds some much older guys<br/>\nattractive, although that&#39;s more uncommon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and mature ways. They make and break friendships based on factors<br/>\n&gt; wholly different from what I had and experienced and saw growing up.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, I wouldn&#39;t have broken off friendships over boy infatution that<br/>\ninvolved narrow and petty views.  I would&#39;ve been more likely to be<br/>\ninvolved in that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It seems clear in these stages that school would&#39;ve been like a<br/>\n&gt; debilitating disease that would have crippled their ability to be<br/>\n&gt; themselves as they are now.

The schools<br/>\nhere don&#39;t allow students to dye their hair.  I&#39;ve asked several kids<br/>\nhow the school would know if they are dyeing it a more natural hair<br/>\ncolor, or lightening it or darkening it or putting highlights in.  All<br/>\nof them said that those things would probably go undetected, but if you<br/>\ndyed it an unnatural color, you&#39;d be sent home.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving pink hair may seem superficial, but it&#39;s very integral to what<br/>\nChamille is exploring in her life right now, which heavily involves<br/>\nfashion, that she herself creates.  Right now she&#39;s designed a jacket<br/>\nthat I&#39;m transposing into a pattern for her to sew.  In the meantime,<br/>\nshe&#39;s making pockets and details.  She&#39;s replicating a subsection of<br/>\nJapanese fashion and putting her own ideas into it.  She&#39;s very<br/>\nanalytical about it and studies it and picks things apart.  Our local<br/>\nstore finally started carrying the Gothic Lolita Bible, after months of<br/>\nasking!  It&#39;s finally been made in English!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Chamille wasn&#39;t able to have pink hair, it would be like telling her,<br/>\nher whole project couldn&#39;t happen.  That would be a huge loss of self!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The relationships were known and public, and played out within and<br/>\n&gt; around the framework of school&#39;s schedules.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Absolutely!

It&#39;s an exception.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s fairly typical unschooler behavior, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see teenaged girls holding their moms&#39; hands at the mall once in a  <br/>\nwhile, and I assume they went to school.  I see girls holding their  <br/>\nmom&#39;s hands all the time among unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe criticism of that would be that it&#39;s immature, the kids aren&#39;t  <br/>\ndetaching, they need to be with people their own age, they&#39;re not  <br/>\ngoing through proper stages...<br/>\n<br/>\nOne bad thing about child development theory as it is misused and  <br/>\nabused is that school&#39;s effects have been put onto the charts as  <br/>\nnatural.  Normal (because it has become normal, in the literal sense  <br/>\nof the word).  Inevitable (which, if school is required with no  <br/>\nexceptions, it would generally be).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust recently Holly and I were talking about the 60&#39;s and what the  <br/>\neffects of the counter culture activities and thought were.  We  <br/>\ntalked about quite a few aspects, but I said people were interested  <br/>\nin looking at what was natural with people as organisms.  &quot;Organic&quot;  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t mean what it means  now that the USDA owns it.  It had to do  <br/>\nwith what was biologically adaptive, what would be if culture and  <br/>\nhistory hadn&#39;t affected the things we do and believe.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;So is that why they went barefooted?&quot; she asked?   And yes, that was  <br/>\nwhy.  I told her about Earth Shoes (the early version, from Canada,  <br/>\nnot the later company that bought out the famous name and made more  <br/>\nmainstream shoes.  I told her about women&#39;s shoes before then--too  <br/>\npointy, too narrow, too small.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so attachment parenting is one of those things.  Instead of  <br/>\nlooking at what our parents did, or even great grandparents, think of  <br/>\nhow homo sapiens would care for offspring if they could be seen  <br/>\nwithout the trappings of later thought.  How do other primates take  <br/>\ncare of theirs?  How do other mammals?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I had babies and was helping other moms understand nighttime  <br/>\nmothering, co-sleeping, feeding on demand and all that, one image I  <br/>\nused to reassure them was that if a fox has seven kits, it doesn&#39;t  <br/>\ndig seven little dens, put one in each and come back to check on them  <br/>\nin the morning.  They sleep with her. It&#39;s safer, it&#39;s warmer, they  <br/>\ncan nurse.  I&#39;d  hardly ever get to the end of my little speech,  <br/>\nthough, before the mom was laughing and totally understanding it.   <br/>\nBut one thing I didn&#39;t say in those days, because I hadn&#39;t thought of  <br/>\nit yet, is that they learn how to be foxes.    What&#39;s natural to many  <br/>\nspecies like that is that they become reproductive within the first  <br/>\nyear or two, and they&#39;ll be better mothers if they&#39;ve been mothered  <br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":294520986,"authorName":"Joanna Murphy","from":"&quot;Joanna Murphy&quot; &lt;ridingmom@...&gt;","profile":"ridingmom1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: *10 How does unschooling teach the vital difference between needs and wants?","postDate":"1226568058","msgId":40193,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdmZ3JocStoYTBsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdmZ2NiYSs5amxrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40192,"nextInTopic":40194,"prevInTime":40192,"nextInTime":40194,"topicId":40052,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I was a new mom looking for support (from  <br/>\nanywhere at that point!) and all I received from your &quot;community&quot; was  <br/>\nwhat you just gave below.  Thanks but no thanks!  The fact remains  <br/>\nthat needs and wants are different....you need to eat but you may not  <br/>\nwant what&#39;s available.  Our life has limitations on not only material  <br/>\nthings but emotional things as well.

I much prefer to talk about principles  <br/>\nand practices.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think when people want support, anything other than &quot;There&#39;s  <br/>\nnothing more you can do.  Don&#39;t feel guilty&quot; might sound mean or  <br/>\nsnide.  This is what support too often looks like:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/support\">http://sandradodd.com/support</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to arrogance, it would seem to be humble for unschoolers to  <br/>\npreface their statements with things like &quot;I&#39;m sure parents of school  <br/>\nkids are discovering the same thing, but...&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m sure it&#39;s  <br/>\nnothing special, but...&quot; or &quot;It might be a fluke, but my kids really  <br/>\ntrust me.&quot;    But when a child learns to read happily on her own,  <br/>\nthat&#39;s exciting!  And when a teenaged boy will sit right next to (or  <br/>\nin the lap of &lt;g&gt;)  his mom or dad in front of other people, that is  <br/>\nNOT the same as typical school-kid behavior.  And when an employer or  <br/>\nboss contacts the parents and gushes about the teen employee or  <br/>\nstudent, saying he&#39;s never seen anyone who&#39;s that attentive and who  <br/>\nshows so much creative initiative, that&#39;s not something about which  <br/>\none can honestly say &quot;I&#39;m sure it doesn&#39;t have anything to do with  <br/>\nhis having been unschooled.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we deprecate the exciting differences, it would make parents of  <br/>\nour detractors feel better.
