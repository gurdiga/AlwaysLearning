I have 5 children and when they were young we also had<br/>\nyoung foster kids.  Now, I&#39;m not sure whether it was a good idea or not.<br/>\nThe kids learned about helping others and they continue to feel the desire<br/>\nto help the less fortunate; but, they didn&#39;t get a lot of alone time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we are all together, it can get overwhelming.  Any time your fanny hits<br/>\na chair, the four youngest want to sit close enough to you so you can<br/>\ncuddle.  The three middle ones want to assist in every, single task you<br/>\nundertake.  All 5 are extremely talkative and the two boys respond with<br/>\n&quot;what?&quot; to almost anything that is said to them, requiring that it be<br/>\nrepeated.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut alone, life is wonderful and good.  We actually have conversations and<br/>\nlaugh and are silly together.  As dh and I have been working to have more<br/>\nand more alone time with each child, things are much improved even when we<br/>\nare all together.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way we work it is each person in the family has their &quot;day&quot;.  7 of us, 7<br/>\ndays in a week, it works out.  On your day, you are the winner of any<br/>\n&quot;squabble&quot;, like picking a blessing, riding in the front seat, picking a<br/>\ntelevision show.  But the big one is helping fix dinner.  Used to be a big<br/>\nproblem because if one came to help, they all came.  Several are young<br/>\nenough that I need a sharp eye....and I don&#39;t have that many eyes.  We also<br/>\nread together privately.  The child and I cuddle on my bed and I rub their<br/>\nbacks as I read to them.<br/>\n-------------<br/>\nJust wanted to say that I got lots of positive response from our support<br/>\ngroup about my &quot;recess&quot; idea.  And that I will be gone for a few days....off<br/>\nto a goat show with only my oldest.  I&#39;m very excited.  Of course, had to<br/>\nspend the morning shaving a goat&#39;s butt but it was definitely worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Digest Number 124","postDate":"1010812182","msgId":2511,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRlLjIwOWUzMjE3LjI5NzExZjE2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":2510,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":2510,"nextInTime":2512,"topicId":2508,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/11/02 10:03:32 PM, starsuncloud@cs.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1861984172\">In a message dated 1/11/02 10:03:32 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; It may be irrational....but I hated my sis for being born for a long time <br/>\ntoo.

Great topics today.<br/>\nI totally agree with Sandra on both the breastfeeding and the child that was <br/>\nacting out issues!!<br/>\nMy first thought when I read about the child&#39;s aggressive behavior towards <br/>\nher brother is that she hates his guts for being born and stealing Mom and <br/>\nDad&#39;s attention.<br/>\nIt may be irrational....but I hated my sis for being born for a long time <br/>\ntoo.

I can <br/>\nnurse my little guy without a blanket or any kind of cover...just lifting my <br/>\nshirt and not show anything. Ok, maybe a little flash of skin, but it&#39;s so <br/>\neasy to latch him on and not flash my boob.<br/>\nI think some people TRY to &quot;let it hang out&quot; to make a point.<br/>\nI do think our society needs to get over it sometimes. But to purposely <br/>\naggravate or upset people only causes people to resist further.<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t going against beliefs to just respect other people&#39;s discomfort. I <br/>\ncan still nurse my baby whenever he needs it, where ever we <br/>\nare....sensitivity to other people&#39;s feelings is not a bad idea.<br/>\nI think your wording was just fine on the first blurb.<br/>\nYou could hem and haw over it forever and you&#39;ll never have the &quot;perfect&quot; <br/>\nstatement that won&#39;t offend anybody.<br/>\nYou could say nothing and offend people at the hotel and cause them to <br/>\nfurther distance themselves from understanding.<br/>\nYou could re-word it to try and not offend a single LLL person and someone in <br/>\nthat group is still going to not like the insinuation that she cover up a <br/>\nlittle.<br/>\nOh well.<br/>\nJust do what is necessary and it will work out.<br/>\nI thought the wording was perfect.<br/>\nSimple and to the point.<br/>\n<br/>\nLemon Curd?<br/>\nIt&#39;s this sweet, delicious spread that has a gel like consistency. That&#39;s the <br/>\nbest way I can describe it.<br/>\nIt&#39;s bright yellow, has a lot of egg in it and lemon of course and tastes <br/>\nsoooo excellent on a hot buttered crumpet!!<br/>\nCrumpets are the little round (english muffin size) bread with lotsa holes in <br/>\nit....all the better for the lemon curd and butter to sink down into. Yummmmy!<br/>\nI will look for my sis&#39;s lemon curd recipe if you want. I&#39;ve also bought it <br/>\nat Albertsons for close to four bucks for a LITTLE jar. Not cheap.
