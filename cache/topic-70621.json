The fact is that someone was dismissive, disdainful, of people sending links to articles.   Articles published eight years ago.   Eight&#39;s probably just a made-up number, which is fine.  It could be twelve, or six, or two.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people send links they&#39;re usually to something on my page or Joyce&#39;s.  No matter what unschooling list or discussion was named, it&#39;s very likely that any eight-year-old links were from those sites.   <br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce&#39;s site has 145 pages.  I know that because I made the random page generator she has there.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy site had 734 links when I last updated my random link generator in 2011.    There are many new pages not yet added there.  734 seems enough for a random experience, as all the new pages are linked from another place or two or three.   But I&#39;ll probably add some more at some point.  I can gather the links from here:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com\">http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMy site has writings collected from nearly two dozen of my favorite unschooling authors, so if those old articles were from some of those folks, the link was probably to something on my site, too.  If it was an article that was in the Connections eZine, I saved out as many as I could grab before the site owner took her site down. If it was an article from the French site Chroniques De Louves, I have quite a few of those I reconstructed from files grabbed after it was deleted from the internet (retrieved with the WayBack Machine).  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo a complaint about someone having sent links to old unschooling articles is offensive, and not just to me.  It insults those who wrote the articles, and who saved them, and those who were nice enough to choose a good link to share with someone they thought might actually want to know more about unschooling and peaceful parenting.   Nobody&#39;s getting paid to do that.  Many people who were helped freely when they first needed information voluntarily hang out and help others.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy would someone complain about that?  It doesn&#39;t matter who complained.  It&#39;s not about the person who complained.  It&#39;s about the substance of the complaint.  It&#39;s about the fact that someone did complain about that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope it doesn&#39;t encourage anyone from sharing such links in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Not a private conversation (continuation of Why we send out links and discuss unschooling","postDate":"1361832118","msgId":70688,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU0MDg3OTQ4LUQwQkEtNEM2RC1BRTEyLUVGQzNBRUMyOTdEOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJMVTQwNC1FQVMzODM5MDg1REZEMkZCQ0I3OTk1NTFDREIxRjMwQHBoeC5nYmw+","referencesHeader":"PDZBMTAyRkEwLTIyM0YtNEZERC1BMTdDLTIzQzhGNEEyRjhDRUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPGtnYzR2dCtnbHBkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8Q0FPT1RhWE5yK2JGQTd4QXh4NGdNWnN2N2sxa3BUMmNfcl8tdmVyV0h1bTNOZDczZnF3QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8Q0FPT1RhWE01bnVpTmMxX1hDNUpzeEdEekFTMy1BbWZpNFJ3VFcrTFBjTUN0N21YZGZRQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8QkxVNDA0LUVBUzM4MzkwODVERkQyRkJDQjc5OTU1MUNEQjFGMzBAcGh4LmdibD4="},"prevInTopic":70686,"nextInTopic":70689,"prevInTime":70687,"nextInTime":70689,"topicId":70621,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- is there any way this could all be resolved off list? -=- This what?

There are a few hundred thousand places to ask mainstream questions.  (Okay, millions of places.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhether a question is going to lead to unschooling or not isn&#39;t about whether a person is an unschooler.   That I honestly do NOT care about, and Pam&#39;s right.  I don&#39;t care when a question is asked whether the person who asked it is unschooling or just asking or unschooling well or not.  It would be like they put a pinecone on the table and we all started commenting on what kind of tree it was from, and about its shape and color, and whether any seeds were still in it, and we were all excited.  It doesn&#39;t matter who brought the pinecone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf we&#39;ve set up to identify tree parts, though, and people are bringing some very cool bark and flowers and pine needles and leaves, we can have a grand time, until someone throws a rusty bolt on the table and argues that because it was found under a tree, we owe it (them) as much respect as we give anyone who brought anything else they found under a tree.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIf they watched for a few days, or a week, the might know on their own that the things we were having so much fun analyzing and categorizing weren&#39;t bolts or car parts or school textbooks or workbooks.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have all those kinds of things at my house—trees, tree parts, car parts, bolts/nails/screws, a few old workbooks I never gave my kids because they&#39;re kind of historic :-), a collection of New Mexico History books, including at least three school textbooks...   and unschooling isn&#39;t compromised by *what* is there physically.  It can be compromised (or prevented) by why people do things, and how they respond, and what they believe.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it was at Radical Unschooling Info on facebook, and not here, where someone wanted advice on jumping to Stage 3 unschooling (having seen the article Kelly Lovejoy wrote about stages of unschooling).  She had been homeschooled, not with a curriculum.     The point of Kelly&#39;s &quot;advanced&quot; stage of unschooling was that after you get through the choppy parts and the rough bits, there comes a smooth place where things look different because the parents are seeing them differently.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes people have said to put the workbooks away for a year or two, and they&#39;ll look different later.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are things that aren&#39;t unschooling things.  Tests, timed math drills, withholding food until &quot;a lesson&quot; is finished.  I don&#39;t want to pussyfoot around that.  But I do agree with Pam completely about this:  <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-What we care about is why certain choices are made,<br/>\nwhat is the motivation, what will help kids learn, what will create a great<br/>\nrelationship between parents and children, what will help keep a child&#39;s<br/>\ncuriosity and love of learning alive and thriving, and so on.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Not a private conversation (continuation of Why we send out links and discuss unschooling","postDate":"1361820789","msgId":70682,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNjE4MjA3ODkuODgyMS5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViMTIwOTAzLm1haWwubmUxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJMVTQwNC1FQVMzODM5MDg1REZEMkZCQ0I3OTk1NTFDREIxRjMwQHBoeC5nYmw+","referencesHeader":"PDZBMTAyRkEwLTIyM0YtNEZERC1BMTdDLTIzQzhGNEEyRjhDRUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPGtnYzR2dCtnbHBkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8Q0FPT1RhWE5yK2JGQTd4QXh4NGdNWnN2N2sxa3BUMmNfcl8tdmVyV0h1bTNOZDczZnF3QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8Q0FPT1RhWE01bnVpTmMxX1hDNUpzeEdEekFTMy1BbWZpNFJ3VFcrTFBjTUN0N21YZGZRQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8QkxVNDA0LUVBUzM4MzkwODVERkQyRkJDQjc5OTU1MUNEQjFGMzBAcGh4LmdibD4="},"prevInTopic":70681,"nextInTopic":70686,"prevInTime":70681,"nextInTime":70683,"topicId":70621,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***I know this might be hard because some threads have a lot of arguing with gems of unschooling wisdom sprinkled throughout , but I would love to see some way","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-816792186\">***I know this might be hard because some threads have a lot of arguing with gems of unschooling wisdom sprinkled throughout , but I would love to see some way to not have to read the argument threads.***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting.  Much of unschooling discussion is about presenting arguments and discussing them.  Sometimes people fight about it and get upset, but the recent discussions have all been pretty civil.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***Without weighing in on who is right or wrong about any if the issues talked about in these posts, is there any way this could all be resolved off list?***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf all unschooling arguments went off list, there would be no list.  Each person should weigh in about what they feel is right or wrong, maybe not always on list, but for sure, for themselves.  If a particular topic doesn&#39;t interest you, skip it.  That happens all the time on lists.  I haven&#39;t read much about the lazy eye.  I have little to say on the subject, zero experience, so I read a couple and skipped the rest.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Not a private conversation (continuation of Why we send out links and discuss unschooling","postDate":"1361808059","msgId":70681,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4OUFBOUYwLTk5MjAtNDFENC1CQzZELTcyREFDRTBDMUE4QUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGtnZnBtcSsyaWI5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtnZnBtcSsyaWI5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":70680,"nextInTopic":70682,"prevInTime":70680,"nextInTime":70682,"topicId":70621,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Not this one. Not even a Yahoo group. I hadn&#39;t looked at this board in, I believe, years. But I *have* participated in smaller, state and local Unschooling and Radical Unschooling message boards. The Thread in Question on Facebook was about unschooling groups generally (at least, to my knowledge; it did mention &quot;groups,&quot; plural, not &quot;group&quot;). I don&#39;t think this group in particular was mentioned; if it was, or if it was &quot;hinted at&quot; or something, I guess I missed that. Color me ignorant. I included an experience I remembered from a local unschooling group.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s funny thing #2: After That Other Conversation on Facebook about unschooling lists, I&#39;d started thinking that maybe things had changed on the lists I&#39;d been familiar with, or that maybe I&#39;d misinterpreted things way back when I was reading them, or that I&#39;d missed something important about radical unschooling itself, so I decided to go look at a few, including this one. I looked at Yahoo groups like this, and at other groups. Maybe I&#39;d had it all wrong! And lo and behold, on one of the lists -- this one, right here -- there were my words, quoted for dissection -- and without my even ever putting them there!  My hypothetical scenario, inspired by an unrelated group, had been brought here to this one! <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I&#39;ve been schooled. I know better now than to talk online about unschooling groups. I mean, any of them, anywhere! Even if I don&#39;t name them! Or maybe especially if I don&#39;t name them. Because what I say about one will be assumed to apply to another; because what I say over here will be put over there and continued without me. And then if I see it and say something about that, I&#39;ll be called a pot-stirrer or a troll or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been schooled. I won&#39;t do it again.

I’m asking about my child and these math worksheets he’s doing.” Then somebody says, “Well, if you’re not here to discuss unschooling then why are you on an unschooling list?” ***<br/>\n<br/>\nWorded that way, the “why are you on an unschooling list” question is reasonable.  The clearer the question can be the more useful and to the point the responses can be. People can only respond to what is actually written.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd what would an unschooling parent’s question about math worksheets be?  Should my child be doing them? Should I help him? Should I encourage him to do something else instead?  ALL of that is about a parents understanding of unschooling.  If unschooling doesn’t matter, then really,  why ask the question on an unschooling list? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you were trying to suggest that the “why are you on an unschooling list” question is contentious then I’d ask that you look at the first part. “I don’t care what unschooling is or isn’t” is the problem in that example. And somewhat insulting if the list is one where many people volunteer their time because they care very much “what unschooling is” <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that’s one problem with made up examples, even if they’re pretty close to actual experience. You probably didn’t mean to sound as dismissive of unschooling as you did. You probably didn’t mean to be insulting. You probably intended to show how a person asking a question can be frustrated by seemingly irrelevant responses.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot every list will suit every person. I stay away from lists where people talk about raising their vibrations and upping their frequency and manifesting manifestations because I don’t care what vibrates and what doesn’t. I don’t go to those lists and announce my disregard for their intended purpose.

So I&#39;m with Pam on that - I want a real example. Maybe there are some older examples - I know that there&#39;s been a big, big shift away from discussing &quot;unschooling&quot; toward discussing &quot;learning&quot; in the past couple years.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can think of relatively current examples on this list and others (on the subject of workbooks or textbooks or classes) where comments are made about how learning happens in real life, about deschooling, about learning to see learning outside of academics and helping kids to do the same - is that what people are reading as &quot;you&#39;re doing it wrong&quot; and &quot;that&#39;s not unschooling&quot;? I&#39;ve said &quot;that&#39;s not unschooling, so unschooling advice might not help you&quot; in real life and online when someone describes lessons and wants to help a kid get through lessons faster or more painlessly. I&#39;ve said &quot;that&#39;s not unschooling&quot; when someone has answered a question about unschooling with advice to do school-at-home. But none of those fit the theoretical scenario above. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;but then, here is this child still, who picked out this workbook in the bookstore (it happens; I swear to you) and is somehow stuck and mom still wants to help, and he&#39;s still stuck and mom&#39;s still wanting to help.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the problem is one we really already know - that people want normal schooling and homeschooling answers: how do I help my kid with this assignment. And those answers don&#39;t exist when you dig down into the depths of learning and interest and human need and what partnership looks like. What kind of help does the child think he or she needs and why? Can mom just fill in the workbook and they can go out and get ice-cream? Is there a better way to learn whatever the child wants to learn (because workbooks aren&#39;t actually very good learning tools)? Does the child want to learn something he&#39;s not ready to do? And then what? What are his underlying needs and -----oh! but no! That&#39;s not the question. The question is how to scoot li&#39;l bubbah through page 17. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s the old paradigm shift issue we&#39;ve all known about for years. No-one starts out asking the &quot;right questions&quot; because you can only start from where you are - and that&#39;s not unschooling (Ha! I got there, good, I feel better) at best it&#39;s Learning About Unschooling and deschooling. And learning takes time. So people are complaining because they don&#39;t want to learn, they want the answer. And to an extend that&#39;s part of learning. I don&#39;t expect everyone to learn the same things in the same way. I stormed off an unschooling discussion back when there was unschooling.com - and after awhile found my way back, after I&#39;d learned a few things elsewhere and came to value what the radical unschoolers had to offer. But not everyone will come to value that - and that&#39;s okay. <br/>\n<br/>\nMo prefers workbooks where the answers are listed in the back, btw, so she can look them up, like game cheats and walkthroughs. Why don&#39;t more workbooks have cheat pages? <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Not a private conversation (continuation of Why we send out links and discuss unschooling","postDate":"1361717599","msgId":70648,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU1QUYxN0M0LTNBREEtNEFBRS04ODhBLTE1QjUwNTNCRjE2MUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGtnYzR2dCtnbHBkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtnYzR2dCtnbHBkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":70644,"nextInTopic":70652,"prevInTime":70647,"nextInTime":70649,"topicId":70621,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I won t come out of this looking good.

The two youngest girls (one mine and one the other mom&#39;s) brought a workbook in and asked me to read the instructions.  It had words in a column on one side and pictures in a column on the other, and the directions said to draw a red line from the word to the picture, or some such.   <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly asked me if it really had to be red, and I said no, to just do it however she wanted to.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other mom (a very school-at-home mom) stiffened and pulled back visibly (showed her displeasure very physically)as the girls were leaving, though they didn&#39;t see her, it was for me) and said &quot;WE think it&#39;s important that our kids learn to follow instructions.&quot;    Yes....

I wanted it to be a factual account that those exact words had been set out in a public place.  it&#39;s not an accusation, or the beginning of an argument.

People learn about unschooling the way kids learn videogames, or the way people can learn to use their computers, or to use programs like garage band, or photoshop, or to use html.  They can start small, mess around, see what other people have done, google it, maybe buy a laminated cheat-sheet from a bookstore in some cases, or bookmark a website they especially liked.  They can ask their friends or relatives to show them a trick or two.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a person doesn&#39;t believe learning can happen that way, they will find it very difficult to be unschooling parents.

I tried to convey that some participants seek, for example, advice about their child who found a workbook and started filling it out and got stuck, or is taking an art class and is having trouble getting there on time, or something specific of that nature, and they receive lectures about how workbooks and classes aren&#39;t really unschooling and maybe they should read more before asking such questions, and they leave unhelped. That is very interesting about what exactly unschooling is and is not, certainly, and of course John Holt&#39;s books remain wonderful and isn&#39;t remarkable about him teaching himself the cello, but then, here is this child still, who picked out this workbook in the bookstore (it happens; I swear to you) and is somehow stuck and mom still wants to help, and he&#39;s still stuck and mom&#39;s still wanting to help. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s fine.
