Isn&#39;t it about the same answer you would get from most schooled kids anyway?  Except for the having a good time part...<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a TV spot this week on a local channel.  They interviewed some local homeschoolers who have a weekly co-op.  I know many of the organizers of the co-op and gagged when I read some of the things they wanted to have, including a study hall where students would NOT be allowed to interact with one another.  Dress code and everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI missed the spot when it aired, but was told that they asked a small group of the teens whether they would homeschool their own children.  According to one of the moms, their was a mixed chorus of yes and no, but they chose to focus on the girl who said no.  She said she is shy because she was homeschooled and now it is too late for her to adapt to school.<br/>\n<br/>\nBleh!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cnn.com/rssclick/2006/US/01/27/gutierrez.unschooing/\">http://www.cnn.com/rssclick/2006/US/01/27/gutierrez.unschooing/</a> <br/>\n  index.html?section=cnn_latest<br/>\n<br/>\n  No school, no books, no teacher&#39;s dirty looks<br/>\n  CNN.com Fri, 27 Jan 2006 2:04 PM PST<br/>\n  It&#39;s a child&#39;s dream.
