We had lots of <br/>\nrain last night which we desperately needed. The conference diva is <br/>\nthrilled:))<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hotel update for everyone: you may want to start making some <br/>\nreservations soon for Albuquerque if you haven&#39;t already done so. We <br/>\nare doing very well on our pickup for this year and are on the verge of <br/>\nselling 75% of all of our available rooms at the hotel. We are doing so <br/>\nsooner than in past conferences. To give some numbers, we only have 60 <br/>\nof the 169 rooms reserved for Thurs, Fri, and Saturday (7-9 Sept) still <br/>\navailable.  On Wed (6 Sep) and Sun (10 Sep), we only have 26 rooms <br/>\nleft. Historically, we don&#39;t sell as many rooms the night before and <br/>\nthe night after the conference, but this year&#39;s pick up has been good <br/>\nsince we&#39;re hosting the Ice Cream Social on Wednesday evening and have <br/>\nthe BYO picnic on Sunday afternoon. Having said that, we went with <br/>\nhistory and reserved only 136 rooms for Wednesday and 111 rooms for <br/>\nSunday -- which is less than the main conference nights (Thurs-Sun). We <br/>\nbelieved we&#39;d be ok when we signed our original contract. For other <br/>\nrooms before the 6th and after the 10th, we still have good numbers of <br/>\nrooms available. So far, the conference rate extends from 1-14 Sep with <br/>\nfolks staying this far ahead and after the conference dates.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kelly and I were in Massachusetts last weekend for the NE Unschooling <br/>\nConference, and many people who&#39;d not planned to make the trek to New <br/>\nMexico are strongly considering it; some have already registered. I <br/>\nhope this e-mail encourages others to do the same soon. Conference <br/>\nhistory has shown some people wait until the last month to make a <br/>\nreservation for the hotel. I&#39;m encouraging folks to register sooner <br/>\nthan later. You can always cancel your hotel reservations if you need.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ben Lovejoy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26007,"nextTopicId":26011}}
