I think several of<br/>\nthe people on the list are <br/>\nnew to unschooling.  I don&#39;t want to try to say &quot;only<br/>\npeople who&#39;ve unschooled for a year or more...&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;only those with kids over the age of <br/>\nfive should post,&quot; but those with less experience<br/>\nshould probably do more <br/>\nreading and less writing at first, at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been thinking about this post and it&#39;s been<br/>\nbothering me.<br/>\nWas this list set up for all unschoolers or just<br/>\nlong-timers. <br/>\nIf newbies didn&#39;t post and just read how would<br/>\nnewbie&#39;s questions get answered? What if a newbie had<br/>\na burning question that maybe old news to long-timers?<br/>\nShould they just keep quiet and hope that the subject<br/>\ncomes up?<br/>\nI understand that you posted this in response to<br/>\nsomeone defending their stance on TV limiting (which<br/>\nIMO isn&#39;t pure, true, radical - or whatever you want<br/>\nto call it - unschooling) and maybe you didn&#39;t mean it<br/>\nas a general comment. But I do think that if a<br/>\nnot-so-confident newbie read it, they may not feel<br/>\ncomfortable asking a question or stating an opinion. <br/>\nI feel that would be a shame for this list and could<br/>\npossibly make it a bit stagnant, with only the<br/>\n&#39;experienced&#39; unschoolers choosing the subjects<br/>\ndiscussed. <br/>\nI would think and hope that *most* newbies would be<br/>\ninterested in hearing all viewpoints and in that<br/>\nhearing, maybe some previously held beliefs may be<br/>\nchallenged. There are probably other newbies that have<br/>\nbeen following this thread and learning a lot from it<br/>\n(and possibly changing some previously held<br/>\nperceptions about TV and limit setting in general).<br/>\nAnd this subject may have never come up if a newbie<br/>\nhadn&#39;t posted about it.<br/>\nI, personally, haven&#39;t been tracking all of it because<br/>\nI&#39;ve been busy and the sheer volume has been<br/>\noverwhelming for me right now (I&#39;m still days behind!)<br/>\n- so I&#39;ve chosen not to get involved in the &#39;TV&#39;<br/>\ndebate this time around. <br/>\nI am grateful for all the insight and awareness of the<br/>\nmore experienced unschoolers on this list have to<br/>\noffer, but does that mean that the rest of us have<br/>\nnothing meaningful to offer or contribute? We&#39;ve been<br/>\n&#39;officially&#39; unschooling for 3 and a half years and<br/>\n&#39;unofficially&#39; for 7 and a half years. I still<br/>\nconsider myself to be a newbie, probably always will<br/>\nbe &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeghan<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGreat stuff seeking new owners in Yahoo!
