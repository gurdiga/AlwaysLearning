But this is a very familiar scenario/relationship for me, and I think that Sandra touched on some of what I was feeling when I read this: <br><br>&quot;<span style=\"color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;font-size:13px;\">So my mother asked me for ideas on how she could get along with me better, and I told her to keep her opinions to herself unless asked, especially in cases where she disagrees with me. She replied, &quot;oh, what, nobody can disagree with you?&quot; And I tried to explain that she can disagree, but keep it to herself.</span>&quot;<br clear=\"all\"><div><br></div><div>Sandra said, &quot;<span style=\"color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;font-size:13px;\">It sounds like you want to control your mom.</span>&quot;</div><div><br></div><div>The fact that your mother asked you for ideas on how she could get along with you better tells us that the relationship is strained, and she knows it, and maybe even is trying to address that. That&#39;s good! <br><br>The fact that you gave her a very specific suggestion to improve the relationship (keep her unsolicited opinions to herself) in response to her very specific request for feedback, and her response to that was to attack you, tells us that she&#39;s not really interested in ways that SHE can improve the relationship. Rather, I would interpret this to mean that she&#39;s interested in making sure that you know that she knows that the relationship is strained, and she wants you to fix this by realizing that it&#39;s your fault (nobody can disagree with you! that&#39;s a character flaw! it&#39;s not her fault!). </div><div><br>All the rest of it is distraction and red herrings. This is not about whether or not being polite equals lying, or anything else. This is about her letting you know that the relationship is strained AND she has no intention of owning any responsibility for that strain AND she expects you to fix it by accepting her as she is. <br><br>The reason, I think, that Sandra sees the rest of your post as indicating that you&#39;re trying to control her is, well, because you are: you&#39;re actually trying to script her responses for her. But it makes perfect sense that you would do this, that you would handle the situation as you did, because she&#39;s your mother, and clearly this was the coping mechanism modeled to you as you were growing up. It&#39;s very controlling, and it puts responsibility for conflicts within a relationship squarely on the shoulders of the Other Person. <br><br>So the response to that is not to control her; it is to control YOU. It doesn&#39;t matter whether or not you&#39;re &quot;<span style=\"color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;font-size:13px;\">wrong in thinking that withholding one&#39;s unsolicited opinion is often the polite and preferable response?</span>&quot; You&#39;re wrong in thinking that that&#39;s going to be HER response. Your mom is not interested in changing her behavior, any more than you are interested in changing yours. One of you has to, though, and since you&#39;re the one asking us, and you&#39;re the only one in control of you, the person who has to change has to be you if the relationship is to change. </div><div><br></div><div>So. If she asks you again what she can do, you&#39;re welcome to remind her that you don&#39;t appreciate unsolicited advice, but don&#39;t expect that to lead to a change in behavior from her.

It&#39;s not technically too late, although I am currently still not talking to my mother. Mostly I&#39;ve been mulling over things and thinking of writing to her rather than trying to get my message out over the phone (no, we do not live together, but she is thinking of spending the summer months living nearer to us).<div><br></div><div>This exchange about politeness and lying came about after a disagreement over what my daughter eats. It&#39;s a long story with my mom making false equivalencies between raisin bread and alcohol, but in the end I noticed that my mother and stepfather&#39;s comments about my daughter&#39;s diet had affected me. I became controlling for a few hours, and then came back to some unschooling resources, and worked through it. This prompted me to tell my mother about the effect their comments had on me, and how I worked through it, and, well, it&#39;s definitely not something that I can talk to her about with good results (duly noted).</div><div><br></div><div>As I have been thinking on my own since writing this question, talking through it with my husband and another friend, I did come to see that the biggest thing I can do is control myself. I kept thinking about how even if she DID want to try to stop giving me her advice, she would probably slip up, and I would still be making a choice on how to respond to that.</div><div><br></div><div>Some ideas I came up with to help me not get pushed into a defensive reactive position were:</div><div>-Don&#39;t take her phone calls the moment she calls - call her back when I&#39;m ready instead</div><div>-Try calling her back on a weekend morning (a time when she&#39;s probably not drinking wine)</div><div>-Do some mindful breathing before calling her back - think about my goal of keeping the peace</div><div>-Have a few more of those handy responses to use - i.e. &quot;we&#39;re going to try this for a while and see&quot;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>When I began reading about unschooling, I was in a much worse place with my relationship with my mother, based on my memories of my childhood. After talking to more family members and understanding more of my family history, I began to have a greater appreciation for why my mom made some of the difficult choices that she did. This has helped me to relax, and so has lots of unschooling advice.</div><div><br></div><div>This negative exchange occurred over the phone, after having a very pleasant holiday weekend with both my mother and mother-in-law staying at our house. Perhaps the politeness issue was a bit more on my mind because my mother-in-law happens to be extremely polite and doesn&#39;t voice anything about her opinions over our choices, other than to say that she has seen how lots of parenting choices often pan out to be just fine in the end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>But, I can see some real benefits that my own mother brings to grandmothering. Unlike my mother-in-law, my own mother is much better at playing. She loves to play games, and will often get on the floor and play with my daughter, interact with her, watch her shows or movies, or even play video games. My mother has also asked to read some of the parenting books and unschooling books that I own, so it&#39;s good for me to remember that she has been/can be open minded and supportive. I can guess that her fears over food are based largely on her own failing health.</div><div><br></div><div>In considering how my mom is treating me, I&#39;ve also been reflecting on how I would treat my own child. I&#39;m looking for more ideas in the archives about teenagers, because I sense that the teenage years are when kids are mostly likely to want to do things that might be scary for parents, and I&#39;m sure I can use some ideas on how to respond with guidance but not fear.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So thank you. I&#39;m getting around to repairing things, and hopefully continually getting better at not reacting.</div><div><br></div><div>And as an aside, Sandra - after I submitted this question, I was poking around some other threads on your Radical Unschooling Info Facebook page, and I found a line where you outright answered my question by saying to someone else that being polite isn&#39;t the same as lying. And I&#39;m pretty sure you posted that either the same day or the day before I wrote this - sorry I hadn&#39;t seen it sooner! I probably would not have posted this question if I had.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>~Amber</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1740018213ygroups-quoted\"><div

It’s nicer to listen and know that they liked my kids and were kinda worried than to rise up and kill the friendship over something that really WAS something I had thought about, or should.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout a yellow rug, I might’ve said “Ah, good point,” or “The rug might wear out before it gets dirty” or “It’s two-sided and washable!” and smile.  Or  “Ah… next time maybe I’ll get a darker one, if this doesn’t work out.”<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Look for the positive, eschew whatever you can that is minor and process it with less hurt attached.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSome relationships are harder than others, for all kinds of reasons, and usually a dozen or more at the same time. :-)<br/>\nHistory, personalities, intentions (perceived or actual) all are in play.  Part of growing up and becoming a parent is becoming an adult who accepts the serious responsibilities, and who can stand strong (in some ways) against danger.  Sometimes the instincts involved in that cause us, without realizing, to identify things as dangers that aren’t and don’t need to be considered dangers.  So the principles that will help us keep our kids safe should be carefully sorted out and examined (gradually, as time goes by) in such a way that we’re protecting our children’s peace and opportunities without limiting them too much.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon’t separate them from their other relatives if you can peacefully avoid it.  And if you can’t have certain people in your everyday life, make the separation subtle if you can, and not dramatic, which is scary and peace-disturbing in itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":522719163,"authorName":"","from":"sukaynalabboun@...","profile":"sukaynalabboun","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Opinions and politeness","postDate":"1484387175","msgId":77626,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY1MEQ5NEFELUY0NUUtNEZBMS1BOEU2LTFGMDE0NUI3RUI4QUB5YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PG80Y3Y3byt0bGpncjdAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PG80Y3Y3byt0bGpncjdAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":77625,"nextInTopic":77627,"prevInTime":77625,"nextInTime":77627,"topicId":77624,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t think we can control other people.
