Lanora (12) was like this, although she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t hit.  She would scream and cry for 1/2 an hour or more, would not <br/>\naccept comfort but wanted me near.  I would just sit with her and wait.  Now <br/>\nshe understands her feelings and knows how to control them; she is a calm and <br/>\ngentle person and always a joy to be with.<br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan (5) is intense and physical, almost every emotion is expressed <br/>\nphysically.  He is gaining more and more control every day but it can seem <br/>\nlike an eternity. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; yup, Riley is a kid who when losses it is very intense. I can  not carry <br/>\n&gt; him.<br/>\n&gt; What seems trivial to you and me, like being the only kid on the block not<br/>\n&gt; invited to a party, sends him into rages.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s trivial, it&#39;s painful.  If some of my friends <br/>\nwere having a party and I wasn&#39;t invited I would be very hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I have permanently pulled muscles from wrestling with Jonathan to <br/>\nkeep either himself or others safe.  LOL  Thank God he has gotten more <br/>\ncontrol as he&#39;s gotten bigger.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Mostly I think I&#39;m just venting. It gets tiring and I lose my love of<br/>\n&gt; parenting when I have to deal with being hit and I feel a bit helpless. I <br/>\n&gt; do<br/>\n&gt; not want to yell, punish, or otherwise make the situation more negative. <br/>\n&gt; Yet I<br/>\n&gt; want him to gain control of his actions. I do not want a 10-12 year old who<br/>\n&gt; thinks it&#39;s ok to strike his mother because he can not do what he expects. <br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; really do not want a 6 year old striking out at me. It puts me in an<br/>\n&gt; uncomfortable situation. Is there anyone out there who deals with a kid <br/>\n&gt; like<br/>\n&gt; this. What do you do when they start lashing out? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The only effective thing I&#39;ve done is to just hold him until the rage passes. <br/>\n It&#39;s like a Hyde to Jekyll transformation!  Within just a few minutes he <br/>\nbecomes this peaceful, gentle and happy boy.  We can talk about what <br/>\nhappened, why it happened and how he can resist the urge to hit next time <br/>\nwhile snuggling together.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realized a couple of things about how I, as the parent, was feeling during <br/>\nthese moments.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving been raised and indoctrinated with the &quot;spank them till they submit&quot; <br/>\nmindset can cause you to question yourself.  People tend to view the parent <br/>\ndealing with a child in a meltdown as ineffective and having lost control.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve done it myself, looked at a kid screaming and the parent trying to talk <br/>\nwith them and thought &quot;Sheesh, who&#39;s in control here?&quot;  So now I see myself <br/>\nfrom the outside and it can make me unsure of myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you parent with respect and tolerance of a child&#39;s personality and <br/>\nemotions you can &quot;appear&quot; to be out of control.  Knowing that control of <br/>\nanother person is only an illusion helps but people will still judge.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just look at Lanora and remember that I could see who she was going to be <br/>\neven when she screamed in my ear for 45 minutes.  I can see who Jonathan is <br/>\ngoing to be even when he is trying to hit me.  They grow up knowing <br/>\nthemselves and why they feel the way they do and the rage isn&#39;t stuffed down <br/>\ninside somewhere where it will do much worse damage someday.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of all, don&#39;t beat up on yourself.  You&#39;ll make mistakes and feel like <br/>\nyou&#39;re totally blowing it but you&#39;ll both make it through.  Apologize, that&#39;s <br/>\nhow they learn to do it and forgive each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nKris<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Kid intensity","postDate":"1039643248","msgId":11283,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0OS40YzFmYTBmLjJiMjkwYzcwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":11281,"nextInTopic":11284,"prevInTime":11282,"nextInTime":11284,"topicId":11235,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/11/02 2:35:28 PM, Tuckervill@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-797694006\">In a message dated 12/11/02 2:35:28 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Tuckervill@...\">Tuckervill@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Is it a special keyboard he wants?

I think it is very very scary when your 6 <br/>\nyo can&#39;t handle the day-to-day normal frustrations that other kids seem to <br/>\nshake off so easily - partly because you imagine them as teenagers or <br/>\nadults and behaving the same way. There ARE people who are like that - road <br/>\nrage is real, for example. But it isn&#39;t a foregone conclusion. Roxana is <br/>\nnow 15 and a delightful person who goes to college and functions perfectly <br/>\nwell - better than most people in the world, imho. When she was 6, she was <br/>\nin school and her teachers&#39; goal for the SCHOOL YEAR was for Roxana to be <br/>\nable to go for one full school day and not have a complete meltdown. I&#39;m <br/>\ntelling you this so that you know that I really DO know what you&#39;re dealing <br/>\nwith - I&#39;ve really been there - and everything turned out just fine for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond - you want help/advice etc on how to handle him. You&#39;ll get lots - <br/>\nI&#39;d do just what you are doing - listen and sort through it and try out <br/>\nwhat seems like it might be useful and ignore the rest.  Read and read - <br/>\nread all those books people have suggested - The Explosive Child, etc. Take <br/>\nwhat you can from them - don&#39;t follow ANY of them slavishly (I know you <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t).<br/>\n<br/>\nThird - this is hard for me to say but I earned the right to say it since I <br/>\ndealt with it too -- don&#39;t blame OTHER people for not wanting your son <br/>\naround. YOU find him difficult and you love him as nobody else ever will. <br/>\nThey don&#39;t want him around (even with you there) because they are worried <br/>\nabout the possibility of him being disruptive. Don&#39;t blame them. In fact, <br/>\nyou ought to appreciate that this is really important feedback for you and <br/>\nyour son to have. He may be a bit young now, but I would not hide it from <br/>\nhim that his explosive behavior is likely to result in him being excluded. <br/>\nIts a choice he needs to learn to make and a reality he needs to know about.<br/>\n<br/>\nFourth - DO NOT TRY TO CHANGE his intense nature. It is hopeless anyway and <br/>\nwhy would you want to do that? He&#39;s going to be an intense person. Help him <br/>\nfind ways to BE intense - for example, help him take that anger and direct <br/>\nit to the real injustices of the world and give him something productive to <br/>\nDO about them. Not just occasionally - but a lot of time spent on this. He <br/>\nneeds it. He&#39;s intense. He probably needs to do a lot more of this kind of <br/>\nthing than most other kids. Don&#39;t think he&#39;s too young. Intensity can be <br/>\nexpressed in athletics, arts, etc. Help him find LOTS of ways to be extreme <br/>\nand explosive and intense - ways that people might even ADMIRE!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nFifth -- his relationship with his older sister probably stinks. It is <br/>\nreally really hard for these kids to deal with the kid who is slightly <br/>\nolder and always slightly ahead - getting to do more things, able to do <br/>\nmore things. They hate it and react badly and seem irrational to the <br/>\nsibling who responds by not caring as much about them as they should. You <br/>\nREALLY have to bring his sister on board in recognizing the specialness of <br/>\nyour son and vice versa. They have to learn to appreciate each other. You <br/>\ncan help both of them understand each other better.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 08:48 AM 12/11/2002, you wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;**I can not<br/>\n&gt;spin both sides of the rope to satisfy his needs. **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I seem to remember, as a kid, sometimes tying one end of a handless rope<br/>\n&gt;loosely around a door knob and then only one &quot;turner&quot; is required, at<br/>\n&gt;the other end.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Betsy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!

I can&#39;t help but think if he hits his mother he hits other people <br/>\ntoo.  If she has stories to tell, just hear them, don&#39;t defend him.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I look back to his 2nd year.

He wouldn&#39;t know it was pain if it had been a constant in his life.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about allergies?  Is he hypoglycemic and needs more protein?  Some kids <br/>\nlike carbohydrates and not protein, but maybe you can find something he will <br/>\neat--peanut butter or boiled eggs or SOMEthing, if it might be that.   Eating <br/>\nmore protein doesn&#39;t take a doctor&#39;s visit to initiate.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre the tags in his clothes bothering him?

I can  not carry him.<br/>\nWhat seems trivial to you and me, like being the only kid on the block not<br/>\ninvited to a party, sends him into rages. I look back to his 2nd year. He<br/>\nthrew 2-4 big tantrums a day for 18 days in a row. I wrote about them to get<br/>\nperspective, to see what may be triggering them. Now at almost 6 he has a few<br/>\na week. Yesterday was a bummer day for him. The rain cancelled our activity<br/>\nwith friends. He was a bit stir crazy and flipped out because he wanted to<br/>\nmake 6 baskets in a row. He pounded the wall, wanted to hit me, slammed doors.<br/>\nLater, he wanted more turns at jump rope. Everyone else was finished playing.<br/>\nI had the others give him more time, but still he wailed for more. I can not<br/>\nspin both sides of the rope to satisfy his needs. <br/>\n<br/>\nMostly I think I&#39;m just venting. It gets tiring and I lose my love of<br/>\nparenting when I have to deal with being hit and I feel a bit helpless. I do<br/>\nnot want to yell, punish, or otherwise make the situation more negative. Yet I<br/>\nwant him to gain control of his actions. I do not want a 10-12 year old who<br/>\nthinks it&#39;s ok to strike his mother because he can not do what he expects. I<br/>\nreally do not want a 6 year old striking out at me. It puts me in an<br/>\nuncomfortable situation. Is there anyone out there who deals with a kid like<br/>\nthis.

No one ever thinks Rain is 9, and ever since she was a<br/>\nbaby she&#39;s looked older than she is - and often people have inappropriate<br/>\nexpectations because of  it. <br/>\n<br/>\nRain had a really hard time dealing with life from about 5 1/2 to 6 1/2.<br/>\nShe kicked me, she hit me, she spit at me. She also drew pictures of<br/>\npeople she was mad at (usually me) being burned at the stake, impaled by<br/>\narrows, shat upon, and so on - I actually preferred this to being<br/>\nattacked. It was a really frustrating time, and I really appreciated the<br/>\npeople in my life who could cut her a little slack, and I was really<br/>\nfrustrated by people who would say things like &quot;Well, I just wouldn&#39;t<br/>\npermit that kind of behavior&quot; - like I had told her sure, go ahead and<br/>\nkick me. <br/>\n<br/>\nI just kept trudging on, removing her from the situation if she got<br/>\nviolent, agreeing that something was unkind (although she&#39;d sometimes get<br/>\nmad because I wasn&#39;t as intense as she was when I talked about things -<br/>\nyelling helped, not at her but at whatever situation she was upset about,<br/>\nin private). I made mistakes, most notably when I&#39;d get really frustrated<br/>\nand say, &quot;Well, that&#39;s life, *deal* with it&quot;, since she was clearly<br/>\ntelling me that she couldn&#39;t deal with it by herself then. It began to<br/>\nget better at around 6 1/2 and now she&#39;s amazingly even-keeled at almost<br/>\n10, although she threw pennies at me a couple of weeks ago when she was<br/>\nmad at me.
