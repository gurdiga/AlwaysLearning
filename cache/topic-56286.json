I&#39;ve been getting spam every week or so. Apparently  <br/>\nthat&#39;s why she joined the list, to phish by hand perhaps the almost  <br/>\n3000 email addys of the members. That&#39;s so fishy. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m so sorry, folks.

AH yes, you  <br/>\ncan.  The e-mails say  &quot;If you do not wish to receive information  <br/>\nreply to this email with unsubscribe in the subject line&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not receiving any.   I&#39;m not surprised.  She came on like a borg  <br/>\nadvance scout, totally ignoring questions like &quot;Are you unschooling?&quot;  <br/>\nfrom moderators.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer site is very much NOT about unschooling, nor helpful to unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI eventually banned her from the list, but not before she pulled some  <br/>\ne-mails.
