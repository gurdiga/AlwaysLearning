It would be easier to suggest alternatives if we were more in exploration mode than focusing on a pre-determined project or plan.  I&#39;ve been drawn to these for the social aspect and also because I like the moms.  Maybe I need to go to more free play opportunities with them and focus on being present and close to my daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\n///If it was myself, I would walk over to the other parents and, smiling, let them know that I didn&#39;t feel like throwing rocks off the roof was safe.///<br/>\n<br/>\nI need help with the &quot;smiling&quot; part.  I honestly feel so stressed out in the moment though on the surface I appear calm.  In the case with the rocks, I did re-direct the kids to throwing away from people, but also suggested that it wasn&#39;t the best thing to do as the gravel was on the roof for a reason.  I think I was getting stressed because my daughter was on the roof (I wonder if I was succumbing to peer pressure!) and I didn&#39;t want to leave her up there to get to the other moms.  I could have been better in this situation by talking to the other moms BEFORE allowing my daughter to explore the roof, too, or saying that I wasn&#39;t all that comfortable with her up there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAh, live and learn.

Yet, every time I see them, they seem to be doing a little bit more than they were before. I don&#39;t expect that from Ethan&#39;s friends&#39; parents, but I do see it...often.

When something comes up, I address it, keeping in mind, that because I&#39;m the adult, I can choose to model the principles that I would like to see.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe most recent incident I can think of was when a friend of Ethan&#39;s threw a boot at me, and said, &quot;Help me with this friggin&#39; thing!&quot;  At first, Ethan thought that was funny, but I quickly said, &quot;I would be happy to help you, but I don&#39;t like the way you asked.  Throwing boots at people is kind of dangerous.&quot;  That&#39;s it.  Then I bent down, picked up the boot, and asked him if he wanted my help.  I knew he was frustrated, and he knew how I felt.  It has never happened again, and, in fact, he has since been quite respectful when he asks for help.  His mom wasn&#39;t there, but she didn&#39;t need to be.  It was my house.  It was my body.  It was my feelings.  I set clear boundaries, and trusted he would try to respect them.  He proved me right, and we both feel good about that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo many things can be learned in these awkward moments.  Through watching me interact in these situations, Ethan is learning what is acceptable, what to emulate, what is (or isn&#39;t) funny, how to set and maintain boundaries, how to avoid getting overly emotional in triggering situations, how to model kindness and generosity...so many things I couldn&#39;t possibly teach him by merely talking about it.  I think we have to live it, experience it, make thoughtful choices, and model what we hope to see.  I also think that if the outcome proves favourable, the choices will seem reasonable.     <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The added complication is that the 6 year old&#39;s mom is not staying close to her 6 year old.  Without knowing their family very well, my best guess is that the 6 year old is desperate for attention (from her own mom), but I honestly don&#39;t want or have the desire to give this 6 year old attention when I&#39;m trying to figure out how to parent my own child who is copying the 6 year old in less than desirable behavior.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think you will run into a lot of kids needing a lot of attention.  I certainly have.  I sometimes find getting together with Ethan&#39;s friends extremely tiring as a result of all of the attention I give.  But, in doing so, it takes the pressure off Ethan, it keeps the play enjoyable, it gives me an opportunity to model healthy interactions, and it helps me stay connected to Ethan *and* his friends so that no one is running off doing things secretly.  One mom actually calls me when her son is struggling, because he spends so much time here.  She knows that I play with the boys, and realizes that I know her son pretty well as a result.  Would he be my ideal pick for Ethan as a friend.  Not really.  He has a lot of attention issues, and they manifest into anger when not met.  But, Ethan likes playing with him, so I feel like it is up to me to help them navigate what is and is not acceptable actions and interactions.  One day, I found this little guy&#39;s brother gluing all of our apples together (he moves fast!).  His need for attention shows up as mischievious behaviour.  I said, &quot;Hey, you want glue something.  How about we find the others and glue some rocks together.&quot;  To the girl who likes to cut plants, I might find her a plant she can cut (weeds), or make one out of paper, or cut something else interesting and different.  You never know where that will lead.  Maybe everyone will get involved and some cool discoveries will be made.  Your daughter will learn that cutting plants isn&#39;t appropriate, but asking mom for cool things to cut up is a lot of fun!  <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How do I guide my daughter when she is emulating irresponsible behavior from bigger kids?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>By modeling the kind of behaviour you would like to see, which would include speaking up among the new people you are gathered with when you see a child throwing rocks dangerously.  Your daughter needs to see you do that to know that it is important.  If it was myself, I would walk over to the other parents and, smiling, let them know that I didn&#39;t feel like throwing rocks off the roof was safe.  Again, if you can find a place that would work well for throwing rocks, everyone wins.  Your daughter sees you acting on your principals, sees you problem solving, and being creative and social in constructive ways.  If she *is* a social person, she will need to develop those strong interpersonal skills.  You can help her by modeling them.  How great is that!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How best to approach (if at all) parents who are not engaged with their kids?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have noticed, that modeling what I want to see, effects parents in positive ways too.  I have had many parents say to me that they like the way I interact with Ethan and their kids.  They notice that the kids come to me with problems often before they approach the parents themselves.

I spoke with her because her mother was not around.  This seems to often be the case when I see this 6 year old (the mother has a toddler, too).  As far as I know, this girl (and others in the group) have been there much longer than me, and seem pretty familiar with each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nI spoke later to my 5 year old about her hurting the plants like the 6 year old did, and also like the 7 year old and asked her why she thought she did those things since she knows how to care for plants.  My 5 year old&#39;s response, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talked about friends and who she enjoyed being with and she mentioned that her 7 year old friend was who she liked being with the most, but that me, her dad and little sister were her best friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat last part comforted me, but I wonder how do I respond to situations where I see her bigger friends (who she emulates) do things that are disrespectful or unsafe?

The 7 year old we often see on a playdate, so we haven&#39;t really changed that.  The 7 year old&#39;s mom is pretty engaged (though philosophically parents more traditionally than me).  I can at least expect not to have to explain we need to keep people safe with the 7 year old.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know my 5 year old loves being social as she is an extrovert, but being home more lately (her mom and sis nursing a flu), she doesn&#39;t ask to meet up with the larger homeschooling group.  If I suggest we go meet with friends, she&#39;s often excited about it, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nI need some clarity on how to navigate this.  If my 5 year old wants to be more social, I want to know how better to respond if/when this dynamic arises.  I also don&#39;t like feeling I&#39;m avoiding public homeschooling things because the 6 year old might be there and I don&#39;t like her influence on my daughter.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe participated briefly with a different group where one day a bunch of the bigger kids climbed on top of a park bathroom building, my daughter included.  My daughter had checked in with me and we talked about how it could be safe and what I thought would be OK.  When one of the boys on the roof started throwing pebbles down near me, I became concerned.  No other parents were checking in on their kids but they could certainly see them from where they were.  I said something to the kids on the roof, but I was new to this group -- I didn&#39;t even know all the kids&#39; names.  This was relatively far from where we live, and for that and scheduling reasons we stopped going after that.  But I was relieved not to have to return to that situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess I am trying to figure out two things -- <br/>\n<br/>\nHow do I guide my daughter when she is emulating irresponsible behavior from bigger kids?<br/>\n<br/>\nand,<br/>\n<br/>\nHow best to approach (if at all) parents who are not engaged with their kids?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for your replies.
