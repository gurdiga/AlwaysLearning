(I watch them for one day one week and Ginger watches my kids one day the next week, etc.) Liv will 9 times out of 10 not eat any food while at my house. Exceptions have been a piece of bread with nothing on it, cheese, mac and cheese, and an unripe tomato she picked from our garden. At first I thought it was me and she didn&#39;t trust me or something. I was feeling badly that she wouldn&#39;t eat at my house, but after talking to Ginger about it I realized Olivia has a hard time eating almost all foods.<br/>\n&gt; In the two years we&#39;ve been watching each other&#39;s kids it has never changed. Liv won&#39;t eat to fullness while at my house even if she says she&#39;s starving. Sometimes she will eat a little cheese or a little of something else, but she has never eaten enough to fill her belly to the point where she will stop saying she&#39;s hungry while she is at my house.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you think the following might have something to do with why she won&#39;t eat?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;ve recently let go of control of my kids meals. For years I followed the<br/>\nadvice, &quot;If they don&#39;t eat what you give them make them wait for the next meal.<br/>\nThey won&#39;t starve themselves&quot;. Well, that achieved no success. They ate what<br/>\nthey wanted of what I gave them and went many meals without food.&quot; (Emphasis mine).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for 6 years, the child has coped with that control by not eating. Just because her mom has &quot;recently let go of control&quot; doesn&#39;t mean the child takes her at her word, trusts that she won&#39;t be forced to eat as her mother wants her to, or is able to shift out of that mindset she&#39;s been in. She is actually proving her mother wrong by starving herself. And for the last two years you&#39;ve seen her, she&#39;s kept control of her body consistently.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I might be tempted to eat the most unusual things to test my mother&#39;s resolve (Is she really telling the truth? Can I trust her? Will she withhold food from me again? Does she believe I won&#39;t starve myself?).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only way I see this easing up is if the mom sticks to giving her choices, allowing her to say no with no judgment, giving her what she&#39;s asking for, and not moving back to controlling how either of the kids eats.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I offer everything we have and ask if there is anything I can buy for next time, but she doesn&#39;t know what she wants. I can vouched that this is not from lack of exposure to all kinds of food (including donuts from Dunkin Donuts and cotton candy and other &quot;processed&quot; foods). You name it, she&#39;s either tried it or it&#39;s been offered to her.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How would she know what she wants, if her food has been controlled and she&#39;s been told what she can eat?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; My children always want whatever Ginger has packed Liv for lunch and I usually end up giving it to them because she doesn&#39;t eat it. Last week part of her lunch was a piece of cheesecake, one of my personal favorites, so when she wouldn&#39;t eat it we all shared it. Also, when I ask my sons what they want me to pack for them to eat when they go to Ginger&#39;s they say, &quot;Nothing. We want whatever Ginger has.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Then it&#39;s not what&#39;s available that&#39;s the issue. I think It&#39;s the control and the lack of trust.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sorry this is so long. I&#39;m trying to keep it short... it&#39;s hard to not give details because I thought maybe it would help if there was more clarification from an outside source (including the perspectives from my 4 and 6 year olds) to assure everyone that there is no shortage of variety of tasty choices, and that Liv has not been left to her own devices. I&#39;ve seen Ginger work with Liv to figure out what to eat and now that she is radically unschooling she is giving her things like a bowl of flour or a cup of ketchup when Liv asks for it. (Again, I hope none of this sounds defensive.) <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe the &quot;working with her&quot; is still too many words and too much &quot;management&quot; for Liv. Offering food without words, that she can take or leave might be a way to help. Offering without asking because maybe it&#39;s too much pressure. Leaving food out for her, like a monkey platter. Offering any of the things she once like to eat, with no &quot;vibes&quot; and accepting her eating or not. It&#39;s the control or the hint of control that&#39;s still getting in the way. Isn&#39;t mom still controlling the flour and the ketchup and now, the maple syrup?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be really hard to see that what you thought was the &quot;right way&quot; to parent and the &quot;right way&quot; to feed your children is nothing like what radical unschoolers talk about and do in their day-to-day lives. It can&#39;t be &quot;I&#39;m throwing out all the controls&quot; without the deep thinking and understanding about where you went wrong and the resolve to do better in each moment. Applying radical unschooling principles isn&#39;t a pill to cure all ills. Removing food controls doesn&#39;t magically restore trust between parent and child. It takes time.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":262321749,"authorName":"maurakardash","from":"&quot;maurakardash&quot; &lt;maurakardash@...&gt;","profile":"maurakardash","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Update on the flour eater","postDate":"1291486985","msgId":58334,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlkZTB1OStsOWlzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDk5OTM0NC4xMDEzMS5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":58328,"nextInTopic":58348,"prevInTime":58333,"nextInTime":58335,"topicId":58308,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Brian, thank you so much for this!

And when you are scared you can see that someone else has been where you are and by applying new skills you can get there. It is so encouraging to be in the company of people who didn&#39;t give up.
