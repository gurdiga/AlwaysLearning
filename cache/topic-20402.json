He tried the first day of<br/>\nschool and was sick by the end of the day. He slowly gave up on this idea,<br/>\nthough not in a way that felt &quot;successful&quot; to him. We talked about this, and<br/>\nhe has had some great raging sessions. Day by day though he seems lighter<br/>\nand happier. Yesterday, when he normally would have been in school, we<br/>\nspontaneously went to see the movie Collateral (movies...a great love of<br/>\nhis...he&#39;s just finishing a script for a scary dark comedy that you may all<br/>\nsee on the big screen someday soon :0). He giggled almost the whole way<br/>\nthere at this relinquished taste of freedom. He has since said to hell with<br/>\nschool and has delved completely into his movie. I&#39;m sure it will be filled<br/>\nwith blood and guts and people getting cut open without their permission.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, thank you for the reminders about what&#39;s important.
