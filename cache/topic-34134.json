Think of it in terms of a sliding scale from homeschooling, relaxed homeschooling, unschooling, (and some might even say radical unschooling).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are &quot;They might do&#39;s&quot; for relaxed homeschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\n - a curriculum that follows the child&#39;s interest - such as a unit on dinosaurs because that is what the child loves/has an interest in.<br/>\nSo they might do math using a dinosaur theme, read and write about dinosaurs and do work books about dinosaurs, etc.  But they might not actually finish the work book as the child loses interest - or they might skip around in the work book.<br/>\n<br/>\n- have a set reading time every day because reading is the one most important thing to them - child chooses what to read.<br/>\n<br/>\n- has math time at breakfast every day - some problem solving of one type or another chosen by parent.<br/>\n<br/>\n- purchase a curriculum or part of a curriculum and then skip around in it with a loose schedule of when they do it - with an expectation that it will get finished.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Some of it is the parenting mind set.  The parent is more of the &quot;boss&quot; in all things:  control over TV, music, games, etc.  how much they do or what they are allowed to do/play.  How late they stay up.<br/>\n<br/>\n- some feel that whatever they do is unschooling as long as they are not following a curriculum at a table.<br/>\n<br/>\n- there are on-line programs that the child pretty much works their way through - where they get to choose their projects and interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n- open to disruptions and spontaneous other activities as long as they eventually get back to &quot;real&quot; school work.<br/>\n<br/>\n- They definitely do at least some school at home, just in a less strict kitchen table 5 days a week, this is our chosen curriculum, way that homeschoolers do.

From feeding to sleeping to<br/>\ndiapering to behavior, etc...there are so many things about parenting<br/>\nduring the first two years of a child&#39;s life that two parents already<br/>\nhave had an opportunity to agree or disagree on. Are you happy with<br/>\nthe degree of agreement you have on those? I would stress those areas<br/>\nin which the two of you see eye to eye during your conversations,<br/>\nrather than try to engage your husband on a &quot;I&#39;m right/you&#39;re wrong&quot;<br/>\ndiscussion (not that you&#39;re trying to do this, but maybe he&#39;s coming<br/>\nat it from such an angle?)<br/>\nAnother thought is that as the breadwinning parent, I know *I* would<br/>\nbe jealous of the parent staying home doing the hypothetical<br/>\nhomeschooling/unschooling. I&#39;d want all that time to enjoy  my child<br/>\nand see them grow! Is there any possibility that your husband, maybe<br/>\neven not realizing, might be preemptively resenting you for having<br/>\nthat opportunity with your daughter?<br/>\nNot that confronting him with any of this would be helplful at all -<br/>\nprobably actually counterproductive. But maybe thinking about it on<br/>\nyour own might help you modify your stance, so to speak, when dealing<br/>\nwith him?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 4/8/08, DaBreeze21 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:susanmay15@...\">susanmay15@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello everyone!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I&#39;m a &quot;newbie&quot; and my only DD is 21 months old.
