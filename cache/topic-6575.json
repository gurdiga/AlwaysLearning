Do you try to find<br/>\nan evaluator who will be open to unschooling (and how do you do that), or do<br/>\nyou find an umbrella school that will let your kids learn without requiring<br/>\ntests or evaluations and only require what they have to? I guess I am just<br/>\nwondering how the rest of you handle this obstacle to their freedom.<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat state? And you could also post this question (or search the archives)<br/>\non your state at the message boards at www.unschooling.com.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know there are unschoolers in every state, so there are ways to do these<br/>\nthings. I also know that if I lived in a state that was particularly<br/>\nannoying (and the way California is about legislation-in-general, someday I<br/>\nmight be!) I&#39;d move if necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is our main priority in life while our kids are of compulsory<br/>\nattendance age -- everything else has to &quot;fit in&quot; with it, and Wally and I<br/>\nwill do anything to preserve it for them, including changing states,<br/>\ncareers, whatever it takes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that might be a fun topic here, too: how far would YOU go to unschool?
