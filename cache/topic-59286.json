He broke his arm this month & xrays showed a bone cyst which will require surgery & long recovery time.  The doc said no football for 2 years.  This feels like forever to him.  He has, in the past, been interested in researching famous football players of the past & watching YouTube football videos, but largely his football interest has been in actually playing the game, working out to get stronger, and just being really physical.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther things he has really loved in the past several years have included video gaming, role play, his xBox live & facebook friendships, photography and videography, listening to music, reading (especially manga), movies, animals, and outdoor activity.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNone of these are bringing him much pleasure lately.  He keeps rather busy with them, but has a very restless quality about him.  Last night he stated nothing appeals to him like things used to, and &quot;I just don&#39;t have a life&quot;.  I have offered a variety of different (or familiar) activities and places to go, books, movies, web sites, music, hiking, museums, etc that are within his physical realm to do right now, but he generally declines the offers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe combination of 1)no football/physical contact-type sports and 2)his being of the age when tastes/interests often change as he is growing and maturing has been a tough one.  He has always been very physical - when he talks, when he plays, even when he games he walks about or bounces on a ball.  There are a lot of physical things he still CAN do, but I think he is grieving some of the other things right now.  An icy winter and below zero days in the midwest doesn&#39;t help, either.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I am thinking about and writing this, I realize that his happy spark often returns when we are doing ANYTHING physical, even just walking to the store.  A definite key there, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Teen angst&quot; has always seemed a somewhat demeaning phrase to me (depends on the attitude of the speaker using the phrase, I think), but looking at the Wikipedia description of it today, it really fits.
