(Similar to what trolls do, and somewhat disruptive as most of us are here to become better parents, not just to pass the time.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI mentioned in my last post on this thread that I think a common denominator in the &quot;guy style&quot; of many new male posters is &quot;competitiveness&quot;.  When someone comes here, and all they do is (metaphorically) stand at the net and volley the tennis ball back  defensively, it looks like they are here to &quot;win&quot; rather than to learn.  People of any gender who come here believing that they are &quot;right&quot; and sounding very invested in continuing to be right and perhaps hoping to *prove* that unschooling is wrong and ridiculous fairly often behave this way.  I&#39;m guessing (now) that this isn&#39;t your intention, but somehow when you made your debut here you did resemble at least partially the argumentative-dismissive profile.  (If you want to see what I see, try going up thread and rereading your first 5 or 6 posts.  Now that you&#39;ve read here awhile, can you see how your posts have a different flavor than the average post?  And if you WERE feeling defensive or flustered or irked when the thread came around the first time, I think you&#39;ll find a lot of value in rereading the responses to your questions.  Or in searching the archives for related previous answers.  Stuff that didn&#39;t make sense before is likely to make sense now.)<br/>\n<br/>\n**<br/>\nAt some point, you see the moderator refer backhandedly to another woman who<br/>\nhas left the group in a storm as acting typically of those with vaginas.**<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you are mischaracterizing what was said.  (Another reason for a reread.  I recall personally using the words &quot;comptetive&quot;, &quot;rational&quot; and probably &quot;condescending&quot;, with some generalizing wiggle words and handwaving attributing those words to &quot;some&quot; guys in general, but not saying every bit was an exact fit for you.  Sandra used the phrase &quot;guy style&quot;.  I don&#39;t recall explicit mentions of genitalia.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are my recollections and opinions, not necessarily that of any other reader.
