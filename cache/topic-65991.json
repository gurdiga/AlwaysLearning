Do fun things for the fun of it, relax and take it easy, spend time snuggling and playing and reconnecting with your child. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor some people, it can also be helpful to think and learn about learning, itself - because natural learning doesn&#39;t look much like education, it looks a lot like people living their lives.

If he&#39;s enjoying that and isn&#39;t bored, you&#39;ll do better looking at what he does and seeing the interest, drive, and thoughtfulness he brings to those things. If it&#39;s reassuring to you, for now you can think about what he might be learning - but over time that sort of thing can get in your way because learning is more often a subtle process of making connections which swirl around and make even more connections. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My problem is how do I use all those interests and teach him what he needs to know.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***********<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can&#39;t, no-one can - you won&#39;t know what he &quot;needs to know&quot; for another seventy or eighty years, when he&#39;s done needing any of it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe good news, is that human beings love to learn, are driven to learn, and we have marvelously flexible brains which are very, very good at learning, able to make all sorts of incredible connections.
