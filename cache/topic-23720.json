I can get frustrated, irritated, etc, but I <br/>\ndon&#39;t have to let it run my day. I can choose to be happy, I can choose to yell, I can choose <br/>\nto laugh, or I can choose to pout. It is beneficial to me, because it reminds me that I <br/>\nalways have a choice in how to react to my kids. That was the context that the author was <br/>\nspeaking in as well, in &#39;A Covenant Marriage&#39;, in regards to how we treat our spouses. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a recovering anger addict...most of it in relation to my childhood. I wish I would have <br/>\nresolved those issues BC (before children) but I didn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t realize I had those issues til <br/>\nI had children. Now we&#39;re working on it together. Often people who yell (me) feel that they <br/>\nare in control, they don&#39;t even realize that they&#39;ve lost control because as a child, they <br/>\nknew that the adults that yelled at them had control. <br/>\n<br/>\nEven more reason for me to be a better parent than the example I grew up with. I had no <br/>\ngood examples. <br/>\nMelissa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@S...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-A quote that I have on my office wall says &quot;It is the worst form  <br/>\n&gt; of immaturity to allow one&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; feelings and desires to control life&quot;.-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What should control life then?<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"controls, maturity, all kinds of questions...","postDate":"1136229097","msgId":23720,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgzMDkzQTk1LTU2NUUtNEE1NS1CODI5LUI2REY1MUQ1MTYyOUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":23734,"prevInTime":23719,"nextInTime":23721,"topicId":23720,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-A quote that I have on my office wall says It is the worst form of immaturity to allow one s feelings and desires to control life .-=- What should control","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1734157339\">-=-A quote that I have on my office wall says &quot;It is the worst form  <br/>\nof immaturity to allow one&#39;s<br/>\nfeelings and desires to control life&quot;.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat should control life then?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23739,"nextTopicId":23633}}
