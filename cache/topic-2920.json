I&#39;m learning that it&#39;s not worth my energy to inform my family of<br/>\nwhat we are doing.  They don&#39;t &quot;get it&quot; or want to &quot;get it&quot;.  They think we<br/>\nare harming our kids by what we are doing and they won&#39;t be &quot;normal&quot; (thank<br/>\ngoodness, I say)....  I think when I spend a lot of time trying to convince<br/>\npeople that, whatever I&#39;m talking about, is the best way, the truth, the<br/>\nreal way, the only way etc etc, then I&#39;m really trying to convince myself<br/>\nthat I&#39;m ok with my own decisions about my belief systems.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe told Zak that if we hit him he could hit us... That seemed fair to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n<br/>\nToday the pro life ladies are marching in front of our county courthouse.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this conservative little town they&#39;re kind of preaching to the choir,<br/>\n<br/>\nbut I suppose it makes them feel good.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo totally change the subject, I have a continuing dialog, e-mail, with<br/>\n<br/>\nmy brother about spanking. He&#39;s expressing his idea that his<br/>\n<br/>\ngrandchildren need more discipline. His words. By discipline he means<br/>\n<br/>\nthey should get a swat or a full blown spanking when they do something he<br/>\n<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m feeling a little ill over his latest correspondence and wondering if<br/>\n<br/>\nI can ever reach him or if I should continue to try. I almost posted his<br/>\n<br/>\ne-mail here to let you all read it, then decided I didn&#39;t want to be<br/>\n<br/>\nresponsible for all the disgust it would cause.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave any of you ever seen someone like this have a change of heart?
