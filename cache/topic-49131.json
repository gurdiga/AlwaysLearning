He doesn&#39;t read very<br/>\nwell, in Chinese or English--he does other things well:  he&#39;s<br/>\ngot a beautiful singing voice and he&#39;s a talented artist and <br/>\nan amazing cook, and he&#39;s very generous with his time and energies--<br/>\nanyway, the parts he *was* able to read, he was able to let me<br/>\nknow that the English quotations below the Chinese translations...<br/>\nor should that be the other way &#39;round?... are spot-on.  Just <br/>\nto be very clear:  he couldn&#39;t read all the Chinese, but everything<br/>\nhe could read to me and translate into English corresponded directly<br/>\nwith the English.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it interesting that a Chinese speaker would groove on<br/>\nunschooly ideas; that culture, what I know of it, anyway, has<br/>\na lot of competition in the schools, a lot of memorization, a <br/>\nlot of surpress yourself and impress your teacher...<br/>\n<br/>\n...I think all of that at least partially explains why this<br/>\nparticular son chooses to go to school.
