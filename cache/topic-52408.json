I wonder if she&#39;d be willing to speak about her <br/>\nexperiences in school - from the perspective of having been an <br/>\nunschooler. That might be really helpful for her to sort through all her <br/>\nmixed feelings and confusions. She might like reading, &quot;How I Became an <br/>\nAutodidact.&quot; I haven&#39;t read it, but Rosie has read it several times and <br/>\nloves it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d guess what will be hard for her for a while is not feeling like <br/>\nshe&#39;s &quot;doing something.&quot; She&#39;s got quite a few years behind her of <br/>\nothers telling her what to do and getting &quot;credit&quot; for doing things. It <br/>\nmakes sense for her to feel adrift, without that, for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince she&#39;s into theater - maybe she can audition for some local shows? <br/>\nThat would give her time some structure with a product at the end, which <br/>\nmight help her feel better.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244242275,"authorName":"Joanna","from":"&quot;Joanna&quot; &lt;jbwilkinson6@...&gt;","profile":"joanna514","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"She&#39;s back!","postDate":"1269960250","msgId":52408,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhvdDJucStnM3EwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":52410,"prevInTime":52407,"nextInTime":52409,"topicId":52408,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"She just quit college.

I dont know if she would have gone if he was still here.  <br/>\nIt left a 6 year gap between her and her younger siblings and parents trying their best to cope with devastating grief.  <br/>\nShe mostly liked high school.  <br/>\nThe theater department, learning French, going to dances and football games were the highlights.  <br/>\nIt was very interesting to watch and listen to this unschooled child go through this system.  <br/>\nShe told me everything about her days and her opinions and mostly I felt she was having a positive experience.<br/>\nThen slowly and subtly I started noticing a change in her.   She really cared what the status quo was and started figuring out<br/>\nhow to do as little as possible to get the grade.  Her passion for learning was slipping away and it became more about just getting by.<br/>\nSenior year came and she wanted to go to college.  I tried to get her to take a year and travel/work, but that&#39;s not &quot;how it is done&quot;.<br/>\nWe spent a year looking for colleges and applying and she got accepted and chose one.<br/>\nWe couldn&#39;t pay for it all, so we got grants and loans for her.   She was going to major in acting.  <br/>\nShe wanted to experience theater at the college level.   Well she experienced it.  She had a pretty good freshman year, but wasn&#39;t thrilled about <br/>\ngoing back after the summer.  She didn&#39;t know what she would do here at home, so she went.  She was in a production, got into the theater fraternity,<br/>\nand was passing her classes.  But, she was miserable.  She seemed to be slipping into a depression.  She hated the classes that she had to take<br/>\nthat were required, not her choosing.  Then she even started resenting the classes she use to enjoy.  After Christmas break, she was saying she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t think she would go back for her Junior year.  She was planning on finishing this semester though.  She went back and things got worse.  <br/>\nShe didn&#39;t want to leave her room most of the time.  She did meet a boy over Christmas break and that seemed to lift her spirits, but he lives here, so she <br/>\nstarted coming home on weekends (she was 3 hrs away).  It got harder and harder for her to return and she decided she really couldn&#39;t take <br/>\nit anymore.  She did have to stay until March 22 to fulfill her grant requirement, or pay back $5000.00, so then she felt trapped and angry.<br/>\nShe is home now, and has absolutely no regrets about leaving, but still feels lost.  I keep telling her to take her time.  She needs to deschool!<br/>\nShe wrote this on her Facebook page so she didn&#39;t have to explain over and over why she was leaving.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m leaving. I&#39;m done. My experience here is over.  I&#39;m dropping out of college and I couldn&#39;t be happier! For all my friends who went to public, private or any type of school their whole lives, who took the SAT&#39;s, who applied for colleges, who strived for A&#39;s and academic successI understand your concern and difficulty understanding this decision. Growing up, most of us go through the system of, make good grades, get into a good college, get a good job and die after enjoying a nice retirement. My life&#39;s teachings were very different. I was unschooled for 8 years of my life. 2nd through 8th. And it was the best thing to ever happen to me. I was free to choose what I wanted to learn. My parents never expected A&#39;s because being a happy child and learning happily, on my own time, was what they saw as successful. I&#39;ve always been supported in my choices. I decided to go to public high school and my parents supported it. They constantly reminded me through it all, when I would get upset over a bad test or stress out over missing school, that the most important thing was my happiness. When I didn&#39;t want to do my homework, or didn&#39;t want to go to school that day, my mom would say &quot;then don&#39;t&quot; and that would be that. My success was on me, on what I felt was important. And I was successful! Honor roll, school plays, good grades, clubs, I achieved what I wanted, only because I wanted it. But it was never to get into a good college. It was never to prepare me for a job. It was solely to experience something new. Just like when I was home schooled I&#39;d learn through my experiences, on the sheer basis of learning for learning&#39;s sake. And so when I wanted to learn about college, to see what it was like. My parents supported that too. And I did it! I got into CNU! Not to become a doctor, lawyer, or even actress. I came to college to experience the &quot;now&quot; of it all, not to work towards my &quot;tomorrow&quot;. Unfortunately the &quot;now&quot; of school is no longer an experience I enjoy. I&#39;ve loved my time here and the people I&#39;ve met, but I&#39;ve lost myself in concern with deadlines on paper that don&#39;t matter to me, attendance in classes I didn&#39;t even want to take. My future is wide open and I&#39;m confident in myself enough to know that I&#39;ll be successful in achieving whatever I want to do, I always have been before. College does not determine a persons ability or intelligence. Yes it does help in the career field, but if I wanted a career and knew what I wanted to do with my life then I&#39;d stay in college and work for that. I&#39;m young, vibrant and excited to see the world, to be inspired and I&#39;m positive that wasting my money doing something that no longer excites me is in no way going to make me anymore eligible to be a successful career woman in the future. I am so confident in my decision to leave, because it is the first thing in a long time that I am completely 100 percent sure of. I am in no way trying to say that anyone else&#39;s choices are wrong or that going to college is bad. I&#39;m just trying to explain why this is right for me. I&#39;m not having a mental breakdown. I&#39;m not quitting because it&#39;s hard. I&#39;m not giving up. And I&#39;m not Prego! I&#39;m simply continuing on with my life by doing what makes me happy, and what is best for me. <br/>\n-Carly &lt;3 <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the person she wants to be, but has so much anxiety for the future, she is blocking her own path. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe got some good comments from her friends, but has also experienced others who just don&#39;t get it and are avoiding her.<br/>\n<br/>\n I wish I could make it all better<br/>\nfor her.  All I can do is encourage, listen, and love.  I&#39;m worried she may be suffering depression (my mil takes meds for depression).<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully, it will just take some time.  She has always been a pessamistic type of person.  Loveable and hilarious, but has a dark view of things that I don&#39;t have.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I just thought I&#39;d share our story.  Unschooling doesn&#39;t seem to have a down side when described on these list and it&#39;s probably true!  But life can get in the way sometimes.  Our childrens choices <br/>\nmay be ones we don&#39;t agree with.    It wont make everything perfect.  But, I am so grateful it&#39;s the path we chose.  And I think Carly will find<br/>\nher way, and hopefully it wont be a long journey, since she knows where it can lead.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis does leave me wondering if I should try even harder to discourage my younger 2 from going to highschool if they start expressing interest.<br/>\nMaybe step up the traveling adventures when that time comes.....</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52425,"nextTopicId":51415}}
