I<br/>\n&gt; have the unschooling handbook and John Holt&#39;s &quot;Teach you own&quot;. Both<br/>\n&gt; are inspiring. My oldest children are 7.5 and 6.5 and they have used<br/>\n&gt; Calvert Gr. k and 1, and now they are using Calvert Gr.3. I am<br/>\n&gt; definitely teaching to the books, and it is obvious that I don&#39;t like<br/>\n&gt; it and they don&#39;t. I mean, they do just fine, and enjoy some of the<br/>\n&gt; stories, but it is so textbook. It is stifling. Calvert isn&#39;t cheap<br/>\n&gt; and I hate to waste, but I really want to let it go. Do you feel so<br/>\n&gt; much freedom when you finally deschool yourself and just trust in your<br/>\n&gt; children? I plan to still use the Calvert Math, but cut back the work<br/>\n&gt; sheets. I will still use the books, some are fun to just read. But I<br/>\n&gt; want to let the schedule go. We have a star chart for each lesson<br/>\n&gt; finished, they could not care less about those stars!

My oldest children are 7.5 and 6.5 and they have used<br/>\nCalvert Gr. k and 1, and now they are using Calvert Gr.3. I am<br/>\ndefinitely teaching to the books, and it is obvious that I don&#39;t like<br/>\nit and they don&#39;t. I mean, they do just fine, and enjoy some of the<br/>\nstories, but it is so textbook. It is stifling. Calvert isn&#39;t cheap<br/>\nand I hate to waste, but I really want to let it go. Do you feel so<br/>\nmuch freedom when you finally deschool yourself and just trust in your<br/>\nchildren? I plan to still use the Calvert Math, but cut back the work<br/>\nsheets. I will still use the books, some are fun to just read. But I<br/>\nwant to let the schedule go. We have a star chart for each lesson<br/>\nfinished, they could not care less about those stars! They are bright<br/>\nand creative and I fear sticking to a strict curriuclum will stifle<br/>\nthat! I think I want to be an &quot;eclectic&quot; homeschooler: some structure,<br/>\nbut using unit studies/letting the children choose projects/some<br/>\nwaldorf aspects that really lend themselves to homeschooling. I look<br/>\nforward to any advice/input. Thanks! Becky</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21049,"nextTopicId":21127}}
