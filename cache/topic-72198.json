I figure if and when my teen decides to get a diploma <br/>\nshe can do it that way, and if she does decide to go to a college there <br/>\nare many who accept homeschoolers - more all the time, I&#39;ll bet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sure do understand the angst about what does she do all day....but <br/>\nthis very morning I was thinking how we have the wonderful freedom in <br/>\nour family to sleep when our bodies want to, from waking to going to <br/>\nbed, we don&#39;t schedule ourselves. My 16 year old looked at nutrition and <br/>\nhealth over the last couple of years, (mostly trying to combat her acne) <br/>\n- I do observe learning occurring and we have conversations about any <br/>\nnumber of things, and we work on our attitudes and being thankful for <br/>\nmany things.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrateful for the support we share online!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am actually finally submitting our reports from last year and <br/>\nregistering for this year for ages 7, 9 and 16.<br/>\nIt is often a stressful time for me but I am going to submit what I have <br/>\nwritten. I am grateful that in Nova Scotia, Canada, currently, there is <br/>\nan examination of homeschooling in an open minded older provincial <br/>\neducational program overseer, who met with homeschoolers last spring and <br/>\nput our minds at ease about the attourney general&#39;s inspection of the <br/>\neducational system and homeschooling! Gratefully we have the support of <br/>\nthe powers that be, who know something isn&#39;t working in school and are <br/>\nwilling to look at what we are doing with open mindedness. It helps me <br/>\nto relax and go with the flow.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nPeace be with you!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":72195,"nextTopicId":72192}}
