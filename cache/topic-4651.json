I was PMSing.... No <br/>\nexcuse  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt didn&#39;t crush my feelings.  I was only concerned about the list itself.  <br/>\nI&#39;m used to people jumping me for being straightforward, but I decided a long <br/>\ntime ago that I would continue to point out when when a statement or theory <br/>\nor practice misses the potential of families and unschooling, and let the <br/>\nchips fall where they may.  There will always be curriculum salesmen.  They <br/>\nmake a big cut of sales.  There will always be schools.   There might not <br/>\nalways be people who are willing to help other unschoolers for free.  Or <br/>\nthere might be, but they might be the people who don&#39;t quite understand it <br/>\nthemselves, or who tried it without a real understanding and reacted with <br/>\nfrustration, and tell other people it doesn&#39;t really work.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Kirby was six and seven I got a lot of criticism, and was openly <br/>\npooh-poohed with &quot;OH, you can ignore her; her oldest child is only seven.&quot;  <br/>\nNow I&#39;m past the halfway mark with my kids  I figure when Holly&#39;s a teen and <br/>\nup and out, I&#39;m not going to be as involved with others&#39; newness.  I had <br/>\nfirst vowed to work at helping others be brave and unschool for four years, <br/>\nbecause I felt really guilty about talking my cousin out of homeschooling.  <br/>\nThe four years have come and gone and I&#39;m still helping because it seems <br/>\nhelpful and appreciated--because I see the difference in families, and <br/>\nbecause I get thank-you notes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I respond to posts it&#39;s very rarely directed to the person who wrote the <br/>\npost.  Sometimes it is, if a particular question was asked (especially on <br/>\nunschooling.com, or a question about something specific), but in the general <br/>\nphilosophical exchange, I don&#39;t even look at who wrote what, and I will pull <br/>\na statement from someone else&#39;s quote and comment on it without ever looking <br/>\nback to see where it first came from.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause mailers have different automatic settings, some people&#39;s (and mine <br/>\ntoo) will say &quot;Babbette wrote...&quot; just because a quote was taken from a post <br/>\nwhere Babbette quoted someone quoting someone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to deal with ideas here, and not with the people who brought them to <br/>\nthe table.  There are some others on this list with the very same intent.   <br/>\nBeginning unschoolers can go to unschooling.com and read a thousand ideas <br/>\ntoday.  Anyone depending on this list (or any one source) for their total <br/>\nunschooling support, idea-font, and guidance could be disappointed.  But <br/>\nthose who want to look at ideas in the light of unschooling that&#39;s working <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t be disappointed as long as we keep the personal elements to a <br/>\nminimum.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":49413852,"authorName":"astrologerdawn","from":"&quot;astrologerdawn&quot; &lt;dawn@...&gt;","profile":"astrologerdawn","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Negotiating with Kids and Time to Apologize","postDate":"1013527672","msgId":4651,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGE0YmM5bys0NmtsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4653,"prevInTime":4650,"nextInTime":4652,"topicId":4651,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks Pat and Deb L for putting perspective on what was being said and apologies to Sandra for my outburst....
