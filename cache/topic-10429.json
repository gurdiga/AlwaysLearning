But I hated the rides.  The very first rollercoster in my whole life and it was Space Mountain.  My dad had to hold onto me to keep me from jumping off.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWent again when I was twelve with my cousins youth group.  I was a little older and it was even better.  Got over my fear of the roller coasters.  :)  Didn&#39;t have much money but had a swell time.  After that I decided I was going to go back on my honeymoon someday.  And believe it or not I did.  Nothing else I planned for my wedding happened right but that did.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nShawn and I got married in December and went on our Disney Honeymoon in Feb.  For Valentines day.  And again, even as an adult I was mesmerized.  But I LOVE flashy lights and crowds.  I realize not everyone does.  I just love adventure really and anything different than my regular life.  I used to joke that when I was young that I would find the fun in a public execution.  I would go to teen dances and spend the whole time crying only to come home and write about how amazing it was in my journal!  LOL   <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re planning to go again with the kids someday when money will allow.  I haven&#39;t been as a parent yet so that might be a whole different feeling.  Going in Feb. was something I would definitely do again.  It was rainy but the lines were short sna d it wasn&#39;t so HOT.  The downside was that several of the rides were closed for maintenance which they do in the off season.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 cents.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaiteGet more from the Web.
