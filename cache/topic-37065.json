We just<br/>\nmade the decision to home school a week and a half ago. Since then I have<br/>\nbeen devouring everyone�s blogs and posts. It just makes so much sense to<br/>\nme. Thank you to everyone who posts on here. You�ve really helped me<br/>\narticulate what I want for my children, what I think will add more value to<br/>\ntheir lives, and what I think they deserve. I wish I could meet you all at<br/>\nthe conference in a couple weeks, I just couldn�t afford it this year<br/>\n(single mom, grad student, basically indigent). But, hopefully we�ll be<br/>\nthere next time! J<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI thought I would add that my children, though we are technically living<br/>\nbelow the poverty level :), have wonderful grandparents and extended family<br/>\nmembers who provide them with EVERYTHING! They have so much stuff, it<br/>\nliterally looks like someone emptied a truck at our front door that was<br/>\nsupposed to fill a toy store. My kids don�t really know we (appear to) live<br/>\nway out of our means. To keep living expenses down, we live out of the city<br/>\nand share our house with another single mom and her two daughters. There is<br/>\na big difference in our children, even though they have access to all the<br/>\nsame stuff. I think that stuff is not what gives kids bad attitudes, rather<br/>\nit is the treatment they get from their parents. A lot of parents would<br/>\nrather buy a kid a toy than play with them. But, I�ve never personally seen<br/>\na �spoiled� child who was truly listened to, respected, and cared for,<br/>\nregardless of how much stuff they had.

I have learned more through challenging myself to reach<br/>\nhigher than from any externally applied competitive pool of play or school<br/>\nlife.  It&#39;s possible to compete with your past &quot;levels&quot; rather than with<br/>\nother people.  Mentally you can do that even if you are playing with others<br/>\nin a competitive game.  It makes it way more fun... realizing that the real<br/>\ncompetitor you&#39;re playing against is yourself not other people.  Because if<br/>\nyou can keep expanding past previous levels and attain more knowledge<br/>\nthrough such challenges to yourself, then you can continue to play for a lot<br/>\nlonger with happier motivation.  Of course, many people never understand<br/>\nthat point and they may be happier with the idea of beating others out than<br/>\nchallenging themselves.  The problem with that only occurs if you lose and<br/>\nothers win, where does it leave you?  One down.

She shouts  <br/>\nout for help with spelling words a lot.  She recently started her own  <br/>\nguild and has a great time recruiting members and fostering a  <br/>\ncooperative and positive theme for her guild.  She told me that her  <br/>\nguild is about the more experienced helping the less experienced.  I  <br/>\nunderstand there&#39;s a lot of that in WoW.  She structured her guild  <br/>\nbased on her favorite book series, Warriors, about wild cat clans.   <br/>\nShe is the leader and then she has deputies, warriors and  <br/>\napprentices.  She spends a lot of time chatting with her guild  <br/>\nmembers when she&#39;s online -- encouraging them, inquiring about their  <br/>\nday-to-day activities that they&#39;ve shared.  I talked to her about the  <br/>\nconcept of paying it forward and suggested that that phrase might be  <br/>\nan efficient way for her to communicate her idea about how the guild  <br/>\nshould function.  I don&#39;t know if she&#39;ll use it but she does like to  <br/>\ncome up with positive, encouraging  guild messages of the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve talked about not sharing personal information online even when  <br/>\nit feels like you know the other player well. I wonder how many of  <br/>\nher guild members would be surprised to find she&#39;s only 10 years old.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChris<br/>\nRadically Unschooling in Iowa<br/>\nThe Unzone<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -=-his dad and I have spent countless hours sitting next to him and<br/>\n&gt; spelling for him when he asks us to spell a word so he could play<br/>\n&gt; games, -=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Marty used to play a game called Alliance of Nations (AON) which was<br/>\n&gt; all chat-room and IM based, on AOL.

They were on TV and he was just having a really great time.  Robin Hood has some really funny scenes; Hercules too.  These were funny and entertaining for us and yet they led to many more connections throughout the day & spilling into more days too.  He even wanted to know when they were made so he could discuss/analyze how time periods effected things like dance scenes, jokes, political correctness/acceptance of the time, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nHercules led to his reviving a computer game he likes called Age Of Mythology and dragging out his mythology books.<br/>\nThen he told me yesterday he was glad he decided to play Mythology again because now he knows how to spell &quot;Trojan&quot;.  This moment of joy and confidence for a child that flunked every spelling test in first, second, and third grade because he could not write fast enough to keep up with the teacher as she gave out the words for the test - so then he decided he could not spell ;(  was so simple in the making - all on his own by playing a game he likes.  Which started with a TV movie.  Well I say all on his own - his dad and I have spent countless hours sitting next to him and spelling for him when he asks us to spell a word so he could play games, and do searches on the internet.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are enjoying &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; as a family too.  Actually there are several &quot;old&quot; shows we are enjoying together on an ongoing basis, Hogan&#39;s Hero&#39;s and MASH are two more.  Plus we&#39;ve always enjoyed the Loony Tunes cartoons.  Loony Tunes is how he was exposed to (learned about) opera and grand classic piano concerts when he was very young.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":355895636,"authorName":"Linda","from":"&quot;Linda&quot; &lt;wolrablk@...&gt;","profile":"craftrica","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: What stands out","postDate":"1218518224","msgId":37088,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGc3cjZjZyt1ZWFxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDRFN0Y1MTQ3QzdCNzQzOTFCN0VDNUU0NzlEM0FEOEEyQEVkUEM+"},"prevInTopic":37074,"nextInTopic":37089,"prevInTime":37087,"nextInTime":37089,"topicId":37065,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... thing I like about homeschooling / unschooling / my son is that not many 14 year old boys would sit and watch Disney s Pocahontas - all because he was","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1272186475\">--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ed Wendell&quot; &lt;ewendell@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; As I&#39;m sitting here exploring on the computer I realize that one<br/>\n </span></blockquote>thing I like about homeschooling / unschooling / my son is that not<br/>\nmany 14 year old boys would sit and watch Disney&#39;s Pocahontas - all<br/>\nbecause he was flipping channels and chose to watch it.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; So far we&#39;ve discussed the non-authentic clothing of the Native<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Americans in the movie - we looked that up on the internet.
