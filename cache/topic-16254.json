I watch my beautiful babies-come-adults maturing hourly - yikes!   I love each phase, and I&#39;m delighted with them as people, but I miss those baby years too.  Life was simple.  Not easy, back-breaking, but simple.<br/>\n <br/>\nThat&#39;s really beautiful, Susan, that you can acknowledge what your inner struggle with the issue really is.  Whenever I start resisting what shows up with my kids, I know that I have a problem.  They have no problem!  They are constantly changing and at times it triggers something inside me.  It&#39;s usually fear of something.  Then I know that I have work to do on myself.  My job is to stop avoiding the feeling that is coming up and just feel it.  Then I fall into clarity about the situation.  I think that demonstrates responsibility to children in a way that nothing else can.  Great work!<br/>\n <br/>\nFondly,<br/>\nRetta   &quot;To thine own self be true.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

I have two children, a daughter age 15, and &lt;br&gt;a son age 12. I practice attachment parenting, I breast fed both kids &lt;br&gt;until they were over three. We have always homeschooled, neither has &lt;br&gt;ever had a curriculum. Lately my dd has been looking forward to &lt;br&gt;college. She wants to go soon, and wants to start using some sort of &lt;br&gt;curriculum. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It sounds to me like your daughter is an intelligent person and knows what she wants and needs.  I try to give my kids whatever learning/life tools they tell me they need no matter how unpleasant I think it is - that&#39;s the basis for unschooling, no? - to trust the child&#39;s intelligence and self-direction?  Texts and workbooks are not evil in themselves, just another source in the world at our disposal.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A year ago my daughter (9yo then) decided she wanted to opt-in to the local public school art and gym classes.  Boy, I really didn&#39;t want to do that!!  I was terrified of all the problems I imagined it bringing.  I had quite a time of it separating my fears from her decisions.  But we did it and it&#39;s worked out great for her.  She gets the occasional comment from other children wishing they could homeschool too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One day the gym teacher said he would be giving a written test on safety.  My daughter said she wasn&#39;t gonna do it.  She wanted to stay home from gym until it after the test.  I told her that she would probably have to make up the test at some later date.  She asked me to write the gym teacher a letter excusing her from the test.  I did!  I told him that written tests were against our religion and I appreciated his honoring &quot;our diversity in this matter.&quot;  John Holt says you&#39;ve gotta speak their language, you know!  We then had to decide what our religion was.  She decided to tell him that it was secret.  &quot;You mean you can&#39;t tell me?&quot;  She shook her head and when she walked away she almost died laughing, she said.  He let her pass out the pencils and tests and collect them.  She was happy.  She knows how ridiculous all that crap is, but the games are fun so she goes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, I just came across something in Growing Without Schooling about a great math textbook that Holt recommended for older kids through adult who want one.  It&#39;s called, &quot;Mathematics: A human endeavor&quot; by Harold R. Jacobs.  I found it in our library and I will keep it in mind if my daughter ever decides she wants something like that.  It looked interesting.  I thought it worth mentioning.  There&#39;s so much good stuff in that GWS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also found a happy little book called &quot;The Joy of Mathematics: Discovering Math. All Around You&quot; (Theoni Pappas) sitting next to it on the shelf which I did check out.  Each page gives a brief description of a historical structure, optical illusion or some concrete thing in the world and then a drawing and a puzzle, brain-teaser or logic problem to figure out.

I guess I needed that push. My dh keeps telling me that I <br/>\nwon&#39;t be &quot;breaking any rules&quot; since there really aren&#39;t any. I need <br/>\nto listen to him more. &lt;g&gt; I sometimes think that since unschooling <br/>\ncame so naturally to us, that I have as much a hard time letting <br/>\nschoolish things in as people who school-at-home do letting go of <br/>\nsome of that control. And your thing about your daughter taking tests <br/>\nin gym, that&#39;s cool. My dh said getting this program for our dd to <br/>\nuse isn&#39;t like I am going to be saying things like; &quot;It is 9 o&#39;clock <br/>\nnow, get out your math book and do the odd problems on pages 52 and <br/>\n53. Then study last weeks chapter for the test this afternoon.&quot; I <br/>\nwill be approaching this just like I approach every thing else, here <br/>\nit is/use it if you want/hope it helps/I&#39;ll be over here if you have <br/>\na question... <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she was little, everything was so hands on with her. Every day <br/>\nwas filled with coloring and cutting and pasting. Reading till our <br/>\nvoices hurt was a common thing. Going out to work together in the <br/>\ngarden was an adventure and most years we didn&#39;t grow too much <br/>\nbecause we all spent time digging things up to look at roots, or <br/>\nplaying with the bugs. Now she has her own small plot where she grows <br/>\nher own things, mostly experiments that she doesn&#39;t want us to mess <br/>\nwith. And we don&#39;t read aloud as much as we used to. Well, that isn&#39;t <br/>\ntrue. We just don&#39;t read stories like we did. Now we will say things <br/>\nlike &quot;Oh, you should read this book/article.. it says here...&quot; and <br/>\nthen read something. She has her own friends and interests and Mom <br/>\njust isn&#39;t included as much. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think my whole problem with this math thing really isn&#39;t that. I <br/>\nthink I am starting to experience empty nest syndrome. Because when <br/>\nshe was 3 and 6 and even 10 and 12, she showed me everything and now <br/>\nshe has developed such a wonderful arena of friends she has many <br/>\nother people of all ages, to share things with, not just me. Don&#39;t <br/>\nget me wrong. This was my goal, I wanted her to grow up and be well <br/>\nrounded, to be curious about the world, to be interesting, <br/>\nindependent, strong, and happy. I, or rather she achieved my goal <br/>\nmany times over. She is all of those things, and more. She is smart, <br/>\nquick, has a wonderfully sharp wit, she has aspirations and goals for <br/>\nherself and she has plans all laid out, she is beautiful and takes <br/>\npride in herself. I should be happier about all this than I am. But I <br/>\nalways said, if they could live at home with me forever I would be <br/>\nhappy. So I will just have to be happy with math too!<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109501676,"authorName":"Retta Fontana","from":"Retta Fontana &lt;rettafontana@...&gt;","profile":"rettafontana","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: math textbook dilemma","postDate":"1061907898","msgId":16254,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwODI2MTQyNDU4LjUxOTAzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0MjAxLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":16255,"prevInTime":16253,"nextInTime":16255,"topicId":16254,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From:   Susan  Date:  Fri Aug 22, 2003  2:57 pm Subject:  new to this group-help-long ADVERTISEMENT Hello, my name is Susan.
