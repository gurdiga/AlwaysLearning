Personally, I think teens should have more access to<br/>\neverything and more rights and more responsibilities, not less.**<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the US people are allowed to drive, marry, enter into contracts all before <br/>\nthey are allowed to drink alcohol. <br/>\n<br/>\nA person can join the military and go to war, be entrusted with weapons and <br/>\nthe choices of when to kill and when not to kill, and then not be allowed to <br/>\nraise a glass to fallen comrades at the local VFW when they return. It&#39;s just <br/>\nwrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy setting up alcohol as the adulthood gate we practically guarantee that <br/>\nmore teens will have serious alcohol problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************<br/>\nGas prices getting you down?
