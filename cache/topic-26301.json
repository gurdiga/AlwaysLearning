If you can&#39;t figure  <br/>\nout how to set one up, there are lots of people here who would be  <br/>\nwilling to help you!<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to think my kids would want school supplies, but they didn&#39;t.   <br/>\nThey can keep the same set of crayons for a long time, and take care  <br/>\nof them. We used to have an old-time school supply store that sold  <br/>\nindividual crayons of the basic 16 Crayola colors.  They had little  <br/>\npackets of metallics, too, and a skin-tones set.   But my kids would  <br/>\nreplace their most used-up crayons and keep the same box. Without  <br/>\nschool desks to contend with, crayons can last a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd they have the same binders and notebooks for a long time, too.   <br/>\nWhen Kirby took community college classes, he used some Ninja Turtle  <br/>\nfolders (the kind that go into a three-ring binder) that I had bought  <br/>\nhim when he was six or seven.  He had used them for several different  <br/>\nthings over the years, but he cleaned them out and took them to class.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m the school-trained one who smells autumn and wants new paper.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my kids were little lots of their toys and supplies were stored  <br/>\nin school lunchboxes.  They fit on shelves well and it was an excuse  <br/>\nto buy some, though we usually got them from thrift stores.  And  <br/>\nthree-ring binders became holders for Pokemon cards and various  <br/>\nthings in sheet protectors.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":173427227,"authorName":"Vijay Owens","from":"Vijay Owens &lt;vijayowens@...&gt;","profile":"vijay_berry_owens","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Target $1 Section FYI","postDate":"1153174027","msgId":26305,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM2ZjJmNjJiNDA5MTU2M2VkN2ZhNTJjY2FmMTRiZGQ1QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PEE0NzJBNUQ0LTIxM0MtNDBBOS05RjZGLUU2MzgzNzRCNjlDOUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwZmIwMWM2YTllMCRkNThhN2ZmMCQ2NTAxYThjMEB0aWJlcml1bT4gPEE0NzJBNUQ0LTIxM0MtNDBBOS05RjZGLUU2MzgzNzRCNjlDOUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":26304,"nextInTopic":26306,"prevInTime":26304,"nextInTime":26306,"topicId":26301,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I didn t so much take it as a heads up about Target in particular (though in that context I would have loved to have heard about it a few days sooner, lol) but","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2054800149\">I didn&#39;t so much take it as a heads up about Target in particular <br/>\n(though in that context I would have loved to have heard about it a few <br/>\ndays sooner, lol) but just as a reminder that so-called &quot;school <br/>\nsupplies&quot; can really enrich your unschooling experience.
