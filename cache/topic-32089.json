There would be something excessive and intemperate about such a  <br/>\nperson. Yet like so many other things, listening to wireless  <br/>\ntransmissions may become a habit, and a bad habit. Fear that one may  <br/>\nbe missing something by not listening is one cause; but a more  <br/>\ninsidious one is the feeling that something is going on somewhere,  <br/>\nand that rather than take the trouble to do anything else for  <br/>\noneself, one might as well listen to it. That, of course, is as great  <br/>\nan injustice to the art of Broadcasting as it is to the listener  <br/>\nhimself. It is a misuse of what, properly used, can be a very real  <br/>\nboon to the aesthetic life of any household. I would urge listeners  <br/>\nto cultivate the art of using their wireless receivers intelligently  <br/>\nand artistically, so that the immense care and trouble that are taken  <br/>\nin compiling and presenting the programmes shall achieve their true  <br/>\ndirection and effect.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nfrom Schott&#39;s Almanac, page-a-day calendar, e-mail edition<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5158,"nextTopicId":32091}}
