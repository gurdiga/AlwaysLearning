One of our speakers is Peter <br/>\nGray, a research professor of  psychology at Boston College and blogger for <br/>\nPsychology Today. (If you haven’t  read Peter’s blog, please go now! As <br/>\nunschoolers, it’s amazing to have an  academic “get it” so powerfully!)  <br/>\n_www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn_ <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn)\">http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn)</a>   He’ll be around all weekend, because he’s  excited to <br/>\nalso learn about US!<br/>\n<br/>\nOther presenters include Ren Allen, Erika  Davis-Pitre, Cameron Lovejoy, <br/>\nand many others. We’ll be entertained by grown  unschooler Carsie Blanton, an <br/>\nup-and-coming singer-songwriter currently on tour  in Europe.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere’s also the Talent Show, Untrepreneurial Fair, Funshops,  and <br/>\nwonderful community to look forward to. This year we&#39;re adding a dance and a  music <br/>\njam for later night play.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, register  early and save some money! Also, now is the time to apply for <br/>\nscholarships if  your family needs one to attend this year.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you’ll make it.
