I have two daughters (6 1/2 and 3) and a babe due in April.  I have known I wanted to homeschool/unschool my children since before they were born, but having the headstrong child I do, my oldest wanted desparately to go to school.  I tried painting a realistic picture of school life for her without demonizing it.  She has a lot of friends who do go to school.  We agreed to homeschool for kindergarten, and if she still felt strongly about it she could go to 1st grade.  Well, she did, and loved it for about a month, then became restless, and without going into a lot of detail, I will say that 1st grade girls can be very mean and sneaky.  She got teased a lot, and was specifically told that one girl wouldn&#39;t be friends with her because she was white and had dreadlocks.  (she also made friends, and had some good experiences, but began really missing our unschooling lifestyle)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, we have returned to unschooling since the middle of December, per her request.  We are all so much happier since she was able to see for herself what she felt she was missing out on by not going to school.  She now loves to tell people that she is homeschooled and can &quot;do pretty much whatever she wants to&quot;.  (I have not presented her with this idea, but I am very likely to say yes to her, as long as it&#39;s within our budget to do so) People who know her, know that she is happy, curious, and loving, and will just smile when she says this.  I&#39;m glad she is enjoying our lifestyle, but I see strangers looking alarmed, thinking, slacker mom, takes her kid out of school, doesn&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; her anything, and lets her do &quot;whatever she wants&quot;  Gasp. Shock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dilemma is do I ask her not to tell people this?  I don&#39;t know how much it is my responsibility to not shock strangers with our unconventional lifestyle.  Any input is welcome.  On the other hand, woohoo, &quot;letting&quot; my daughter go to school was a terribly difficult thing to do for me, but because of her intense motivation to do so, and then again being allowed to change her mind, we have found a place where my daughter (and I) can be happy and proud of where we are at.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for your advice,<br/>\nNikole</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50403,"nextTopicId":50387}}
