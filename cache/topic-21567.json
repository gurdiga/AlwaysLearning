When I was cruising a lot as  a  <br/>\nteenager, I could tell what a car *wasn&#39;t* (wasn&#39;t the boy we were  chasing,  <br/>\netc.) by <br/>\nthe look of the headlights.  But hundreds of  models of cars?   No.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-It is an intelligence I do  not possess.-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nThat, the Power Rangers &quot;models&quot; details, etc. are (this surprised me) <br/>\n&quot;Nature Intelligence,&quot; Howard Gardner&#39;s own added-later-to-the-set  <br/>\nadditional intelligence.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s what enables people to tell different kinds of trees, snakes, and  ants <br/>\napart.<br/>\n <br/>\nKirby recognized components of things.  Always and still.  But  when he was a <br/>\ntoddler, if we found a wooden peg or a screw or any little piece  of a thing <br/>\nloose in the house, Kirby knew what it came off of.  And as  he got older, if <br/>\nwe found a game piece or a little plastic weapon from an action  figure or a <br/>\npiece of plastic or the cover from the battery case of something, he  knew what <br/>\nit was and where it went.<br/>\n <br/>\nThat skill stands him in good stead in his job at the gaming shop.   He knows <br/>\nwhich little figures are for which games, and at a glance can tell  whether a <br/>\ncertain card (like for Magic or L5R kinds of CCG games)  is  current for <br/>\ntournament play, what series it&#39;s from, etc.<br/>\n <br/>\nSome more about nature intelligence is here, and more is easy to  find.<br/>\n <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.uwsp.edu/education/lwilson/learning/natintel.htm_\">http://www.uwsp.edu/education/lwilson/learning/natintel.htm_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.uwsp.edu/education/lwilson/learning/natintel.htm)\">http://www.uwsp.edu/education/lwilson/learning/natintel.htm)</a> <br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21563,"nextTopicId":21456}}
