I listen to Pam’s regularly, and also Amy Child’s. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nFor anyone without quick links to those, <br/>\nAmy’s:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://unschoolingsupport.com\">http://unschoolingsupport.com</a><br/>\nThose are short and sweet and often feature me. :-)  There are a few that are only Amy and me.  <br/>\nWhen she die #51, of 50, which was some favorite bits that hadn’t been included for one reason or another, I listened waiting to hear myself, and was sad to find none of me.  But I was embarrassed to say “What about me?”   Then #52 came out, and it was all out-takes from interviews with me.  Then I was embarrassed again, and amused.  You might be, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSubscribe to Pam Laricchia’s mailings to get the introductions to each new interview.  The intros are GREAT, and not easy to find later. I’m not sure where the old mailings can be found, so I save some. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nEach of Pam Laricchia’s podcasts has a range of accessibility, and lately, some have video.  First you can read the e-mail intro, if you’re subscribed.<br/>\nThat will have a link to a page that has a transcript, so you can read along if you want.  Those can be downloaded or listened to directly from her site, and many are also on YouTube.  A thorough examination of one single podcast could take a day or two. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes she has interviewed someone who made me wince, but there are way more who made me sit up brightly, so glad they’d had a chance to say some wonderful things that others will hear, even years from now.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can subscribe to the podasts right there, at the podcast button, so you’ll only be dealing with e-mail and websites.  No facebook needed.  No Yahoogroups needed.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://livingjoyfully.ca\">https://livingjoyfully.ca</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThere’s a list of the podcasts here, down below:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://livingjoyfully.ca/podcast-2/\">https://livingjoyfully.ca/podcast-2/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd two of those have been interviews with me.

(Maybe all of hers are, now.)<br/>\nThey’re part of a playlist I have here, that includes some other things, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRaLUQfpUj7deXUV5JPwR3eYYV_wtyQX7\">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRaLUQfpUj7deXUV5JPwR3eYYV_wtyQX7</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThat’s probably WAY too much, but if you parcel it out over the next two or three years, might be fun. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":341538868,"authorName":"Kelly Callahan","from":"Kelly Callahan &lt;ridgelife@...&gt;","profile":"kellycallahancch","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Phones, and discussions","postDate":"1534249420","msgId":78409,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBSzhRZjUtOUozb0E3TzQtallOZS1DakR1Y1phUmtvYj1DdWtZYUFrQzlKUmlGRGhEZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDk4M0REOUE0LTZBODQtNENGRi1BODVBLTJBNkZFOTkxMjAwMEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDM3QjBERjE4LTQzOTgtNEI2Ri1CNEIzLTZDNjdDQkQ1NUM5QkB5YWhvby5jb20+IDw5ODNERDlBNC02QTg0LTRDRkYtQTg1QS0yQTZGRTk5MTIwMDBAc2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":78405,"nextInTopic":78410,"prevInTime":78408,"nextInTime":78410,"topicId":78401,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I keep up with the Facebook page because it’s helpful for me to read about unschooling almost daily.
