It needs to be actively done, lived.  For that to happen, it needs parents to open doors, work around obstacles, use their ever-growing knowledge of the world and their kids, to enrich their lives with interesting opportunities; things that will delight them.  Those things can be found anywhere.  It&#39;s good to keep possibilities open - you might find something awesome, that you&#39;d have missed if you were limiting where you&#39;d look, or thinking that &quot;an unschooling one-stop shop&quot; had it all.  <br/>\n:)<br/>\nDebbie.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":151819905,"authorName":"barbaramatessa","from":"&quot;barbaramatessa&quot; &lt;bjelwell@...&gt;","profile":"barbaramatessa","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Questions about Culture/ Freedom to Learn","postDate":"1376191982","msgId":71924,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGt1NzBsZSs5YnJzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEZGNUY2RkIwLTIyNEItNDE0NC1CQzcxLTc2MTIyQkY5MzhBN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":71923,"nextInTopic":71925,"prevInTime":71923,"nextInTime":71925,"topicId":71905,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I did mean Dominator culture, and it is a negative term.

Unstructured, free play with<br/>\nmulti-age groups of children; the freedom to quit being the most fundamental right humans can possess. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGray is definitely coming from a different place than unschoolers, but it&#39;s interesting. I wrote a bit about Gray&#39;s ideas on play and how I see them<br/>\nrelating to unschooling for one of my recent talks. Here&#39;s the relevant excerpt:<br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\nExperienced unschooling parents have invested, and continue to invest, much time and effort into developing and supporting strong relationships with<br/>\neach of their children. Why is it worth it?<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst and foremost, as we just discussed, it creates a superlative learning environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet over the years I&#39;ve discovered so many other wonderful benefits. My kids have developed good relationship and communication skills and gained an<br/>\nappreciation for the breadth of human needs and motivations. They&#39;ve seen first hand the benefits of helping those around them meet their needs, and<br/>\ndeveloped solid analytical skills that help them sort through their sometimes tangled goals. Not only did focusing on strong relationships help them<br/>\nbetter understand themselves, it helped them become more understanding of others. It helped them develop empathy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an interesting aside to my observations surrounding this, I recently read Peter Gray&#39;s book, Free to Learn, and in it he discusses how, since the<br/>\nlate 70s, studies based on the interpersonal reactivity index have revealed a significant rise in narcissism coupled with a significant decline in<br/>\nempathy. He makes an interesting point, that this relates to a decline in play. He defines play as &quot;nature&#39;s way of teaching children how to solve<br/>\ntheir own problems, control their impulses, modulate their emotions, see from others&#39; perspectives, negotiate differences, and get along with others<br/>\nas equals.&quot; His play is our unschooling days.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe believes that ultimately it boils down to the freedom to quit. If children want to play together but any of them can choose to leave at any time,<br/>\nthen they are all motivated to negotiate so that the game is enjoyable enough that most children choose to stay and play. In that situation,<br/>\nunderstanding others&#39; perspectives is a very useful skill that naturally develops over time and exposure to that environment. Unschoolers create that<br/>\nenvironment at home, where family members are free to say &quot;that doesn&#39;t work for me,&quot; knowing that the others will do their best to understand their<br/>\nperspective and incorporate their needs. More generally to me, this freedom to quit is the freedom of choice---which unschoolers encourage in spades.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe challenge in society is that over the last 30-odd years organized play has grown to replace free play. Nowadays most play is hosted by adults, and<br/>\nparents insist that their children don&#39;t quit in the name of &quot;commitment&quot;, so there really is no choice. This means that there is no driving<br/>\nmotivation to consider the needs of the participants. Even good old play time is often compromised by parents insisting, even after disagreements,<br/>\nthat their kids continue to play together; that they work it out with their friends right now in the name of &quot;getting along&quot;. That approach does<br/>\nnothing to encourage developing the skills that actually help people learn to get along. Giving individuals the freedom of choice to play or to quit<br/>\ndoes that so much better.<br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\n<br/>\nPam L<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Questions about Culture/ Freedom to Learn","postDate":"1376146068","msgId":71915,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlBN0Y0Q0QzLTBCOTYtNDAzMS1CQjI2LUUyNTI4OTQxMUVENUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDBCNzczNDlBLTg0MjgtNDUwMS04Q0IzLTkzRjA0NTk0QjdCMkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGt1M3BhNytqdm1wQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MEI3NzM0OUEtODQyOC00NTAxLThDQjMtOTNGMDQ1OTRCN0IyQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71914,"nextInTopic":71916,"prevInTime":71914,"nextInTime":71916,"topicId":71905,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sorry!!

So very often, my 10 year old will be on his way to sleep and will call out &quot;Mom!!!  I just realized something amazing!!&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think many children spend so much time in school and in Structured Activities that they don&#39;t have much time to play any more - and I think that&#39;s where people like Dr Gray are doing much good, encouraging a return to play and a move away from so much Instruction and Structure. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut do I think we&#39;re evolved specifically to learn through play?

And without basing his decisions on Have To&#39;s.  I think splitting the world up into cultures and sub-cultures is interesting but not necessarily productive :-)  People making decisions based on who they are, and on their understanding of the world and their wants, desires, and interests within the world, seems more fun and fabulous to me than people making decisions based on what they presume certain segments of our Culture would want them to do :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n****how do you find your culture/tribe/community?****<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the years, we&#39;ve met people we enjoy being around.  Some we&#39;ve encountered because we live near each other, or work together.  Some who also homeschool or unschool.  Some who were originally Friends Of Friends, and who now we count as friends of our own.  Some with whom we share an interest or two - for example, we&#39;ve been into birding for a while now, and in the past few months, we&#39;ve started encountering other birders while we&#39;re out and about - haven&#39;t met anyone I&#39;d consider a Friend yet, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if eventually a friendship or two develops.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have a need for everyone who is my friend to live like I do :-) and neither, it seems, do my husband or our son.  Life is more interesting when there are a variety of people and perspectives involved and around.  My opinion :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n****Do you have support for your lifestyle beyond your immediate family?****<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting question.  I don&#39;t know that we have &quot;support for our lifestyle&quot; any more than we support anyone Else&#39;s lifestyle.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do know that we have people who accept us for who we are and how we are - and that we afford other people with whom we associate the same respect.  &quot;Live and let live&quot; can be a sort of a cliche, but for our particular family, it has a lot of relevance and well describes how we relate to others, and how we appreciate others relating to us.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I know that people who want to Tell us how to live and how to be, or tell us what they don&#39;t like about us or about how we live, are not people we choose to hang out with or count as friends :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n****is having a healthy family culture enough to thrive in a dominator culture?****<br/>\n<br/>\nI googled &quot;dominator culture&quot; as it wasn&#39;t a phrase I&#39;d heard before :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think I like to think of myself as living in a &quot;dominator culture&quot; as, though it may be the case, it seems more of an antagonistic way of looking at the world around me than would make me feel particularly happy :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich doesn&#39;t mean I want to deny Reality and live in a lovely land of puffy clouds and smiley faces :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it does mean that I would rather not focus on ideas like this:<br/>\n&quot;Dominator culture teaches all of us that the core of our identity is defined by the will to dominate and control others.&quot; ~ bell hooks<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that I would rather rejoice in the fact that, in my particular unschooling household, no one is trying to Dominate or Control anyone else - no one is trying to Make others do things, or think things, or have things - no one is trying to be in In Charge in that sort of icky way :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, in my house, my husband and I both try very hard to create an environment where each one of the three of us is free to Be and Think and Do in accordance with who we are as individuals.  Control and dominance might be forces to contend with in the outer world, but at home, they&#39;re not welcome :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nColleen <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Questions about Culture/ Freedom to Learn","postDate":"1376144926","msgId":71913,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBCNzczNDlBLTg0MjgtNDUwMS04Q0IzLTkzRjA0NTk0QjdCMkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGt1M3BhNytqdm1wQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGt1M3BhNytqdm1wQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71912,"nextInTopic":71914,"prevInTime":71912,"nextInTime":71914,"topicId":71905,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- If not, is having a healthy family culture enough to thrive in a dominator culture?-=- Is dominator culture is too negative a concept, when thinking of","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-655067815\">-=- If not, is having a healthy family culture enough to thrive in a dominator culture?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIs &quot;dominator culture&quot; is too negative a concept, when thinking of your children and the world of your neighborhood, your town, and their future.

I think humans have exploited it in a big way to allow us to learn way more we need to carry on our culture.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe natural inclination to enjoy unstructured free play with multi-age groups (who may not all be sub-adults) is probably inherent in the biology of most social species. (Which doesn&#39;t mean every individual enjoys that. Again, generalizations say nothing about an individual.) But that&#39;s only a piece of how culture is passed on. If that&#39;s all that was available, &quot;society&quot; would probably look a lot like Lord of the Flies ;-) <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople learn through absorption. Observation. Hearing. Imitation. Thought and analysis. Trying things. Trying things in new ways. Seeing what happens if. Crafting theories and testing them. Making connections. Conversation. Being corrected. And others. (Some of that is part of play, but people generally think of play is &quot;playing with toys&quot; or &quot;playing games&quot;. So the term isn&#39;t as clear as it could be.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t understand what he or you mean by &quot;the freedom to quit being the most fundamental right humans can possess.&quot; It doesn&#39;t seem connected to the previous statements. I&#39;ve found bringing rights into an argument tends to muddy it. Claiming there are rights injects a supposed &quot;truth&quot; that not everyone has agreed with, often an idea that&#39;s confusing to refute since it sounds like the thing itself is a bad thing. That is, yes, being able to quit is a good thing, but I don&#39;t see it as a right. I think it&#39;s clearer to discuss individual wants, needs and preferences, what people find nurturing for themselves rather than rights.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[{"url":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/qWvRkUED2HA?wmode=opaque","type":"VIDEO"}]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Questions about Culture/ Freedom to Learn","postDate":"1376142187","msgId":71911,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGt1NWcxYittNjBjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGt1M3BhNytqdm1wQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71910,"nextInTopic":71912,"prevInTime":71910,"nextInTime":71912,"topicId":71905,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ************ From an unschooling perspective, a better question would be: how does cultural transmission happen in the absence of formal education?

That the children accept that their family way is better than the culture around them?

This makes sense to me, but how do you find your culture/tribe/community?***<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a lot of long time friends that I&#39;ve maintained over the years.  They do take maintenance!  Some of the people that my kids know are people they&#39;ve known their whole life.  My kids are far apart in age, so many of the connections that my older daughter made are completely different than my younger daughter.  My oldest is 19 and has, for years now, made friends through common interests.  Many of them she is still friends with from her early teen years.  My younger daughter has a handful of really select friends that she&#39;s found reasons for staying friends with, either they are kind, or they have things in common, or they simply enjoy each other&#39;s company.  The internet has played a huge role for all of us!<br/>\n<br/>\n***Do you have support for your lifestyle beyond your immediate family? If so, how have you established that? If not, is having a healthy family culture enough to thrive in a dominator culture?***<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t really feel the need to have support for my lifestyle.  I know that sounds weird, but it&#39;s how it is for us.  I have friends with kids in school and friends who homeschool and friends who unschool.  I have friends with kids who are grown and friends with tiny babies and friends with no kids at all.  The big part of this, was to not throw my &quot;radical&quot; life in people&#39;s faces.  If there was a reason to continue a friendship, then those reasons were good enough to be kind and thoughtful of the other person and vice versa.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently had life changing health issues and I&#39;m on the mend.  My &quot;community&quot; of support consisted of a few friends that I&#39;ve known for 20-27 yrs, a handful of unschooling families, and my immediate and extended family.  Many wonderful people helped us financially, to get through some very difficult couple of months.  What I was maybe surprised by was the fact that people I&#39;ve known for so long that I don&#39;t always see, were the first ones on call when everything happened.  There&#39;s a long history there.  Those are the people that I became friends with through mutual interests and maintained connection with for at least 20 yrs.  My unschooling friends are very new in the whole scheme of things, and 20 yrs down the road I imagine it will be the same thing with many of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I&#39;ve gotten older, I&#39;m suspicious of people that have only new friends.  It&#39;s a red flag saying that they might be the kind of person that burns bridges.  Establishing new friendships is good, but really maintaining old ones is what makes a community for yourself.  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":151819905,"authorName":"barbaramatessa","from":"&quot;barbaramatessa&quot; &lt;bjelwell@...&gt;","profile":"barbaramatessa","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Questions about Culture/ Freedom to Learn","postDate":"1376086151","msgId":71905,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGt1M3BhNytqdm1wQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":71906,"prevInTime":71904,"nextInTime":71906,"topicId":71905,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi all, I m reading Peter Gray s book Freedom to Learn, and I have some questions to pose to the seasoned unschoolers here.
