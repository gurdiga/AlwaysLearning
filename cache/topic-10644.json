I ll save it for my diary after I write it.  In a message dated","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1283833484\">This isn&#39;t about homeschooling, so it wouldn&#39;t hurt my feelings if you all <br/>\nskipped it.  I&#39;ll save it for my diary after I write it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nIn a message dated 11/13/02 3:06:28 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ejcrewe@...\">ejcrewe@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Oh, and I&#39;m down to one or two painkillers a day, motrin <br/>\nthe rest of the time, so I&#39;m feeling less loopy.  How are you doing with the <br/>\npain? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI went off pain killers a week and a half ago.  Monday November 4.  I saved <br/>\nwhat seemed to be two days&#39; worth, in case I were to fall or something, and <br/>\nwanted to dope up until I could get to the doctor for more, because my <br/>\nnarcotic allotment for this accident was done.<br/>\n<br/>\nI took Advil or Aleve (after they found it for me), not every day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut by Friday I was feeling like I was dying.  JUST DYING.  I was having <br/>\ncreepy, useless, irritating and non-productive dreams.  I woke up Friday <br/>\nfeeling like I was in a pool of stench, so I got up, figured out how to do a <br/>\nsponge bath (Holly helped me set up in the bathroom), and Holly washed by <br/>\nsheet and pillow cases and blankets.  She kept saying they didn&#39;t stink, <br/>\nthough.  Keith had told me the night before I didn&#39;t stink, either.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of friends I asked desperately for help.  Others I told NOT to come <br/>\nsee me, thanks anyway.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSaturday my friend Frank called, who&#39;s always since we were kids known what&#39;s <br/>\ninside people.  I have vague ideas, but he&#39;s always known REALLY exactly, and <br/>\nhow it worked, from a mechanical to a molecular level, and now that he&#39;s <br/>\nalmost 50, he knows all of what western Chinese and Indian/Ayurvedic medicine <br/>\nthinks about all those things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was feeling better Saturday, but told him how bad Thursday and Friday had <br/>\nbeen.  He asked when I had stopped the painkillers.  Monday.  Exactly, he <br/>\nsaid.  Withdrawal.  DTs.  The stench and the dreams and the feelings of death <br/>\nwere my brain and nervous system readjusting.  So he asked about other <br/>\nsymptoms, predicted a few, was spot on, told me to go get this&#39;n&#39;that (liver <br/>\ncleansing / intestinal assistance) and that Sunday I felt WAY better.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter sitting up and watching &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the <br/>\nDesert&quot; with nine teenagers (I had been watching but wasn&#39;t too far into it <br/>\nwhen a batch of folks showed up and the lead-female said &quot;I&#39;ve never SEEN <br/>\nthis!&quot; so there it was), I did a wonderful thing.  A really wonderful thing, <br/>\nwith Keith&#39;s help.   I went to the back and took a shower.  Sat on a library <br/>\nkick-stool which no longer had wheels, with my back to the shower head (we <br/>\nhave an oversized, flat shower with two hold-bars--closest to handicapped <br/>\nequipment we have, though another bathroom, upstairs, has good bars.  This <br/>\nhouse was for nine years a health facility--halfway house for the university <br/>\nhospital.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat shower was the best thing to happen to me in a month.  I washed my hair <br/>\njust about hair by hair, and used a BIG handful of conditioner.   My cast was <br/>\nwrapped up in a compactor bag, taped two ways, because Keith&#39;s that kind of <br/>\nguy.  I stayed until the water was going cooler.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a week, the 20th, I get a walking cast.  Then I go upstairs and cook.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty said this morning (I woke up and talked to him from 2:20 to 3:15 or <br/>\nso--it was nice) that a few days before that to remind them so they can go <br/>\nand clean up the library.  I told him I had  had a dream that it was all <br/>\nclean.  He said well, it&#39;s not.   They&#39;ve been having gaming sessions and <br/>\nkids staying over.  The library is a two-car-garage-sized room, opens into <br/>\nthe kitchen, and is over the garage.  There&#39;s a deck in the back with long <br/>\ndangerous stairs down to... Keith&#39;s old pickup.  My brother-in-law parked his <br/>\nnice new pickup in our backyard spot for two weeks while he&#39;s in Peru (we&#39;re <br/>\nin the airport city), so Keith moved his ratty old pickup across...  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh... and the other side of the library has a picture window facing the <br/>\nSandia Mountains, which turned yellow and shedded the aspen leaves while I <br/>\nwas stuck in the back.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI went out the other night.  When I was freaking, Friday night, I said I <br/>\nhadn&#39;t been out for two weeks.  Keith pointed out kinda gently that I had <br/>\nbeen out one week earlier to see Fiddler on the Roof.   But he helped me get <br/>\nto the back door, where I stood with the walker under the short eaves, while <br/>\nit rained hard.  The air was NICE to breathe, but I was surprised that the <br/>\ntomatoes were all withered, and the tree was yellow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll survive.  It&#39;s not very pleasant, though.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMonday my friend Jon Ibarra, who was one of my SCA students and is now <br/>\nassitant DA in charge of violent crimes, came over, brought me a Wendy&#39;s <br/>\nchicken salad, told me stories of coronation (not many, I didn&#39;t want much) <br/>\nfrom the weekend, talked to me about lawyers and lawsuits (and thought 40% <br/>\nplus fees was way too much for me to agree to in so clear and simple a suit), <br/>\nand we watched Crimson Tide because he&#39;d never seen it.  That magically took <br/>\nsix hours away from my countdown, and I was glad.   Tuesday morning Keith <br/>\nwent to Target at 8:00 (which meant going to work almost three hours later <br/>\nthan he would have) to get me the extended version of The Fellowship of the <br/>\nRing, with its two LONG DVD&#39;s of how and who and what, with its FOUR <br/>\nvoice-over commentary tracks to play along with its 3.5 hour new length.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s GREAT.  That has made another two days pass quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s another kind of drug. &lt;g&gt;  But I don&#39;t care.  I&#39;m also re-reading the <br/>\nbooks, starting with The Two Towers, checking into the first book to answer <br/>\nkids&#39; questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10677,"nextTopicId":10671}}
