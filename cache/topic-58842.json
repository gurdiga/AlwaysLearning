In fact volume 2 just came out on Dec 28 so we are ordering it.  It is rated older teen age 16+<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m guessing from reading it that it is rated older due to the ability to &quot;get&quot; some of what they are bantering back and forth about. Not sure otherwise as I didn&#39;t see any &quot;adult&quot; stuff!<br/>\n<br/>\nThey use anthropomorphism - giving human characteristics to the countries.  I really enjoyed reading the short personality synopsis they had for each country.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said it is also in Anime form but that he had trouble viewing it on-line due to the web site constantly asking him if he was 18.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nfrom the back cover - or front as you would have it - being as it is a Manga book:   ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat Empires, A Fight to the Finish ... and Pasta?<br/>\n<br/>\nGet ready to brush up on world history with these handsome and hysterical personifications of the Axis Powers as they meet, become friends and form one of the most powerful alliances the world has ever seen!  It all begins when tough soldier Germany stumbles upon Italy, who despite being the descendant of the greatest empire in history, is found hiding in a tomato box.  In another twist of fate around a rather lovely kotatsu, Japan hops on board and the Axis Powers are forged.  What trials and tribulations will this mighty trio face?<br/>\n<br/>\nEd Wendell<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58823,"nextTopicId":58723}}
