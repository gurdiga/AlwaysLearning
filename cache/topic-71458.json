Not even money, just the names of subjects and (if they&#39;re lucky) some A&#39;s and B&#39;s.  The kids at school start to balk.  LOTS of schoolkids shut down, stop liking school (if they ever did), start becoming hardened, start showing their brokenness.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, the unschoolers come into puberty and, without being broken, having had all that time to play, and to think, and to talk to adults and kids of all ages, they start to put all their thousands of bits of trivia into patterns and connections that (turns out) are useful in real-life ways.  And when they see the abilities they&#39;ve gained to synthesize information, they are egaer to get MORE information and find MORE cool channels, sources and resources.  When their parents are able to get them into the world, some of them find wonderful things to do�real things, with adults, like adults, as adults�sometimes for money, sometimes not, but they are IN the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless the parents don&#39;t get unschooling flowing by then, and get into the flow themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Too schooly...?

There were<br/>\nleftover workbooks on the shelf with the coloring books and we still had<br/>\nflash cards that we played games with, but we were living and learning and<br/>\nloving...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe belong to a homeschool umbrella group as part of our legal requirements<br/>\n(instead of being reviewed by our local Board of Ed) in Maryland.  This<br/>\ngroup is great because they arrange lots of field trips.  We love field<br/>\ntrips and they get us good discounts.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of these trips was to the science center to see the nationally<br/>\nrecognized traveling exhibit that is all about farting and burping.  I<br/>\nsigned us up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe day of the trip, all of the parents were delighted with the artfully<br/>\ndisplayed science.  Most of the kids loved it.  My son however asked where<br/>\nthe science was (he loves all things science).  When I said, &quot;it&#39;s right<br/>\nhere, this is science!&quot; My son replied, &quot;Yeah Mom, but it&#39;s third grade<br/>\nscience!  I want to see REAL science!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI realized that he was right.  None of that display had anything to do with<br/>\nthe natural inquiry that is the essence of science.  It was pre-packaged,<br/>\nsound bite edu-tainment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI initially thought it was great because it looked like the sort of thing<br/>\nthat a teacher would use. It gave me that warm fuzzy sense that I could<br/>\npoint to things that my kids learned in the handouts we were given.  But my<br/>\nson brought me down to earth and  I realized that I needed to get clearer<br/>\non what was real life and learning and what was inauthentic factoids and<br/>\nschool and the difference between the two.  I still needed to de-school.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the record, it wasn&#39;t a total bust because we found some other less<br/>\nflashy real science on another floor.  :)<br/>\nChris<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Too schooly...?

Maybe collect different forms of letters cut out from magazines and have an &quot;A&quot; poster (one sheet of paper) and put different kinds of &quot;A&#39;s&quot;--sometimes kids who aren&#39;t in school get confused because &quot;in the wild,&quot; in the real world, people haven&#39;t decided on a single font as a school will have done, so that there&#39;s an alphabet up on the wall and the books the kids are &quot;reading&quot; from (or memorizing) use that same font.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids liked for me to open a word file and set the font really big and they would &quot;type&quot; and see the letters come up.

When a child is lost and can&#39;t answer those simple questions, they end up at a police station, with many questions being asked.<br/>\n<br/>\nEducationally, there&#39;s a similar situation.

Step in and change the subject if you sense<br/>\nthat someone is about to say something rude to her. There were a few<br/>\nsituations in which I went to an adult in advance and said, &quot;Rosie is going<br/>\nto be in your group and I wanted you to know that she doesn&#39;t read or know<br/>\nletters yet so that you could be aware of that and not embarrass her.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople will sometimes assume the child has &quot;special needs&quot; - I would let<br/>\nthem think that so they&#39;ll be nice about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anybody ever said anything about Rosie not knowing how to read or write<br/>\nor spell or know the names of letters or the sounds a letter makes, I would<br/>\nsay, with an assured and confident tone, &quot;Yes, we&#39;re working on it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Concerned about 7 year old not knowing the name of letters","postDate":"1368374539","msgId":71460,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNjgzNzQ1MzkuMzkzMjMuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE4MjIwNC5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGttbzlicSsxMG1zMEBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGttbzlicSsxMG1zMEBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":71459,"nextInTopic":71461,"prevInTime":71459,"nextInTime":71461,"topicId":71458,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If someone says something I would just say:  Oh we are a trilingual family . and leave it at that.

If anyone is so<br/>\nrude as to criticize just breezily say she doesn&#39;t know all the state<br/>\ncapitals yet (if that is true)  or how to drive (if that is true!).<br/>\nClearly she is getting along just fine and has learned to compensate for<br/>\nwhat she doesn&#39;t yet have................writing the rest in the air is<br/>\nmarvelous.  I wonder if the other mom is able to read air writing yet.<br/>\nActually, YOU may not need to say anything.  Your daughter may be advanced<br/>\nenough and enough of an extrovert to deal with external small minds without<br/>\nbeing bothered.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t completely clear to me...............she is able to write all the<br/>\nletters or just the ones in her name? I am curious whether she can already<br/>\nspell short words and communicate with writing.  In other words can she put<br/>\na letter down and ask you to name it?  Just my curiosity, not a diagnostic<br/>\nstep.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it is not clear...........no, you need not be concerned. In my opinion<br/>\nshe is closer to literacy than a child who can recite the alphabet in order<br/>\nbut has no clue what letters are capable of.  Or can rattle off how to<br/>\nspell their name but cannot draw it on paper OR in the air.   Did I mention<br/>\nthat I think air writing is an advanced skill?<br/>\n<br/>\nIF the time should come that other adults express their discomfort about<br/>\nbeing around such a delightful child by making accusations toward her or<br/>\nyou, THEN would be the time to explain to your daughter than sometimes<br/>\nadults have a rigid view of what children should be like and don&#39;t know how<br/>\nto act around anyone who doesn&#39;t fit that mold.   Often when people are<br/>\nuncomfortable or even jealous they will lash out.<br/>\n<br/>\nvicki<br/>\nP.S.: You might also consider that the mom you referenced wasn&#39;t surprised<br/>\nLinnea did not know how to verbalize letters and may not even have figured<br/>\nthat out.  She might have been very surprised that a child would talk to<br/>\nher like a peer or would expect her to read air writing!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sun, May 12, 2013 at 9:35 AM, Bea &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:beatrice.mantovani@...\">beatrice.mantovani@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My seven year old doesn&#39;t know the names of all the letters.
