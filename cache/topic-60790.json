Just this morning, at our local<br/>\nUnitarian Unitarian Fellowship, a mom was lamenting over how she had been<br/>\nnagging at her 17 year old son for **4** days to do his chores.  She ended<br/>\nthe story something like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;So, finally, I told him... Do the dishes, or pack your stuff and move<br/>\nout.&quot;  (I guess he did the dishes).  And then she went on to say she hated<br/>\nto say that and she doesn&#39;t want to have to always &quot;use that&quot; in order to<br/>\nget him to do his chores, and then proceeded to ask that if anyone had<br/>\nadvice about how to raise a 17 year old teenager, she would appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest is 12.  I wanted to tell her to start using paper plates.  And I<br/>\nwanted to tell her that someday, he will move out... maybe after one of her<br/>\nthreats, and how would that make her feel then?  And I wanted to tell her a<br/>\nwhole bunch of other stuff, too, but she probably wouldn&#39;t take me as a<br/>\n&#39;credible&#39; advice giver, since my children aren&#39;t teens yet.  But I do know<br/>\nthat I would never tell John (dh) to do his chores or move out.  And I&#39;m<br/>\nguessing she&#39;d never tell her husband that, either.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn and I had a discussion about that exchange later when we were alone.<br/>\nHe said something about him trying not to judge other people and a few other<br/>\nthings like that.  Of course, I don&#39;t want to judge other people, but if I<br/>\nsee someone kick a dog to the side of the road, I would think... &quot;that&#39;s not<br/>\nnice&quot;.  And if I saw someone abuse a homeless person, I would think...<br/>\n&quot;that&#39;s not nice&quot;.  And when I see and hear people doing and saying mean<br/>\nthings about teenagers (or any child, for that matter), I will always<br/>\nthink... &quot;that&#39;s not nice&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd eventually, after enough of us raise that level of awareness towards<br/>\ntreating children and teens with dignity and respect, things will change.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, thank you, Sandra, for sharing that glimpse into what kind of whole<br/>\nhuman an always cherished, respected, and honored child grows up to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, Apr 22, 2011 at 6:22 PM, Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The nextdoor neighbor at our old house always liked my kids and was sorry<br/>\n&gt; we moved away.
