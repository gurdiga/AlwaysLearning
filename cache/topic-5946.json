It spoke <br/>\nto me as a reminder to be more present where you are. I may not take my kids <br/>\nin the antique book store or the pottery studio but we can surely be <br/>\navailable to any curiosity or interest that shows up wherever we are!  What i <br/>\nmean is that I don&#39;t have to PLAN special trips - special people, events, <br/>\nsurprises are present EVERYWHERE.....just take the time to notice and <br/>\ncherish.....<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thought that I&#39;d like to through out is this:  it occured to me to <br/>\ntake a time (a fall season) and teach my kids NOTHING....NO &#39;educational <br/>\nexperiences&#39;....no classes.....no fieldtrips for the sake of learning...no <br/>\nplanning playdates for 2 weeks from Thursday.....nothing....simply &#39;planning&#39; <br/>\nfor today (or maybe making arrangements for tmrw......What would happen?  <br/>\nI did this as an experiment to wean myself of overplanning.....it was hard <br/>\nbut I told myself that it would not matter in a couple years of we learned <br/>\n&quot;nothing&quot; for 3 months!........wow!  What a great time!  Anywhere we went was <br/>\nbecause one of us brought up the idea bec. of a specific <br/>\ninterest....otherwise, we stayed home a lot....but then we were REALLY glad <br/>\nto be wherever we were....we read the books we wanted (not bec. of any of my <br/>\nulterior motives!).....we went all over, too....I&#39;m sure if I went back to my <br/>\ncalendar and saw what we did I could attach a lot of &#39;educational terms&#39; to <br/>\nthe activities....however, the intent was to let these moments unfold....to <br/>\nbe open and trust that &#39;beautiful stuff happens&#39;.....<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes one of them would say something like, &quot;I like learning about <br/>\nhorses....&quot;  Wow!  What a test bec. my teacher mind would immediately go to <br/>\n&quot;we can go to a horse farm!  there are horse rescue farms nearby! So and so <br/>\nhas horses!  we can go to a vet!  lets get books from the library!  Grandma <br/>\nloves horses, we could get together with her and go riding!....ideas ! ideas! <br/>\n ideas!&quot;  After doing that numerous times with their interests, I noticed <br/>\nthat they didn&#39;t usually have that overwhelming enthusiasm that I did for <br/>\nwanting to show them something!  I&#39;ve learned, with my kids, anyway, to ask <br/>\nmore questions like....&quot;oh, what would you like to do/learn?&quot;  Sometimes they <br/>\nask, &#39;can we visit a horse&#39;?  Sometimes, they are happy just to wonder about <br/>\nsomething and not necessarily want the answer!   sigh, the freedom in that!  <br/>\nWe DON&#39;T have to want/need the answers!  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne time the kids were looking at an insect and I enthusiastically said, <br/>\n&quot;let&#39;s get the encyclopedia out and see what it is and learn about it!&quot; my <br/>\nwise daughter said, &quot;MOM, we want to learn about it by watching it....&quot;  <br/>\nsigh....she was 5 at the time....I have so much to learn!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, there is MY ramble!  I want to simply suggest that we as parents really <br/>\ncould do NOTHING educational......just go about our days, being home, doing <br/>\nerrands, going to where you are inspired to go.......and being PRESENT for <br/>\nthe curiosities and people that present themselves.....and then being patient <br/>\nto let it all run its course....<br/>\n<br/>\nHOpe that makes sense....Thanks, Deb, for the post that inspired me!  I&#39;ll <br/>\nthink more about this today!<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a good one!<br/>\nJane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5937,"nextTopicId":5951}}
