My son has a good friend who, as his mother says, &quot;convinces the <br/>\npeople that don&#39;t believe in ADHD--when he&#39;s on medication.&quot;  She started not <br/>\nwanting to have her son medicated for many reasons, but finally, after <br/>\nagreeing to try it, realized it was exactly what was best for him. Jake <br/>\ndiscovered another side to himself. She realized that this kid had NEVER been <br/>\nable to just relax with anything, even things he desperately wanted to do. He <br/>\ntold her that he felt much happier and asked her to let him continue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I also believe there are VERY few kids like Jake.
