My children -- two girls ages 10 & 13 -- are shy around family, most of whom we live 2 or more hours away from and don&#39;t see all the time. The girls -- especially my 13yo, who&#39;s at that stage where she mostly wants to be around her friends -- don&#39;t want to go to family events like baptisms, weddings, birthdays, showers, etc. Family members have expressed offense at the girls&#39; quietness and &quot;lack of respect&quot; because the girls are slow to answer when someone says hello, or they are too shy to say please and  thank you. (I say it for them.) I feel torn between showing support for family and supporting my children. This is particularly a problem with my husband&#39;s family, and we&#39;ve talked with them about the fact that the girls don&#39;t feel comfortable, that they feel judged for their clothes, for the fact that they don&#39;t go to school, and for their shyness. (Why *should* they want to go if they feel like that?) If you get the girls in a group of unschoolers, on the other hand, the girls are talkative, animated and happy. Unschoolers are the only people they really look forward to being with.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve told my husband&#39;s parents that it&#39;s not a child&#39;s responsibility to make an adult feel comfortable, and I won&#39;t put that responsibility on my children&#39;s shoulders. If family members want to know my children better, it&#39;s their job to make the attempt. I&#39;ve said that they are welcome to come to our home and spend time with the girls here. But I feel bad when the girls won&#39;t even attend family events, and don&#39;t want to be present for baptisms, weddings, etc. Although the girls are old enough to stay home alone, it often means I stay home, too, and my husband goes by himself. Some of these family events are once-in-a-lifetime events. I won&#39;t make the girls go, but at the same time I feel bad that we&#39;re not going, and family members are really beginning to hold it against us. My kids come first. What else can I do?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheryl</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":304821644,"authorName":"Allyson","from":"Allyson &lt;rainbowartistally@...&gt;","profile":"allycat.rm","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] rich lives for shy children","postDate":"1253155999","msgId":47275,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZhN2JjY2E2MDkwOTE2MTk1M2gzMTQ2MDkzOG5hMzM2YjliNjEwZGRkMTliQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGg4cm9rMCtubDI1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGg4cm9rMCtubDI1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47273,"nextInTopic":47298,"prevInTime":47274,"nextInTime":47276,"topicId":47262,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I was a painfully shy child and I know that what made it worse for me at that age was when my mom or others would put me on the spot saying things like why","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1279293947\">I was a painfully shy child and I know that what made it worse for me at<br/>\nthat age was when my mom or others would put me on the spot saying things<br/>\nlike &quot;why are you so shy?&quot; or &quot;Did the cat get your tongue&quot; and other things<br/>\nimplying that my shyness was bad or wrong.

Well, I don&#39;t know if shy is quite the<br/>\n&gt; word.

In fact he is quite the entertainer,<br/>\n&gt; very chatty and funny!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In respect of his shyness with new folk, though, I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m doing<br/>\n&gt; the right thing by him here. We have a play-meet with a group of Mums and<br/>\n&gt; kids once a week, and I *really* enjoy it, as it&#39;s really the only time I<br/>\n&gt; have to connect with adult friends (we&#39;ve recently moved city so don&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt; anyone here.) But because the group is fairly new, Eli is anxious about<br/>\n&gt; going, and spends the morning as we&#39;re getting ready to go, saying things<br/>\n&gt; like &#39;&#39;I won&#39;t want to go, I just want to stay home with you!&#39;&#39;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would like to continue going to the group in hope he will warm up to the<br/>\n&gt; other children and have fun. And because I enjoy it too(when he isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; complaining that he wants to leave). But without knowing how long it will<br/>\n&gt; take, I&#39;m not sure whether to continue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was also wondering, because the people in our lives are part of what<br/>\n&gt; makes life so rich and colurful, how do we help create rich lives for shy<br/>\n&gt; children? I&#39;m sure Eli would be happy if he never had to be introduced to a<br/>\n&gt; stranger again! Sometimes it almost seems he is physically in pain from his<br/>\n&gt; shyness so I don&#39;t feel inclined to take him to many social groups at all.<br/>\n&gt; But of course once he gets to know people, he adores them, and learns so<br/>\n&gt; much from them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Look forward to hearing your feedback,<br/>\n&gt; Kerrie in Australia.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nAllyson Moll<br/>\nTranscription Services<br/>\n608-577-8851<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":255816758,"authorName":"Mel","from":"&quot;Mel&quot; &lt;beensclan@...&gt;","profile":"beensclan","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: rich lives for shy children","postDate":"1253153054","msgId":47273,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGg4czVldSt2dTRkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGg4cm9rMCtubDI1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47272,"nextInTopic":47275,"prevInTime":47272,"nextInTime":47274,"topicId":47262,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi All, A quick intro....

A rich life for a shy child may not involve many people at this time in their life.  It may involve hours with you on the floor creating a tiny world filled with clay people, or lego creations, or whatever fascinates your son. In our particular corner of the world, we are in the country, often with no vehicle to get into town.  We don&#39;t really spend a lot of time right now at groups.  We do spend hours listening to classical music while sprawling on the lawn, playing with toads (weird combo, I know).  There are outside people of various ages in our sons&#39; lives, but not many.  The boys are almost always happy. I know that one day as the boys grow older, more people will enter the picture.  Until the outside colourful people mix in to our days, we&#39;ll enjoy all the beauty and adventures around us.

Maybe let<br/>\nhim make friendships in less crowded circumstances and return to the<br/>\nplay-meet when more people are familiar to him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBernadette.<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/U15459\">http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/U15459</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":321729783,"authorName":"Angela Shaw","from":"&quot;Angela Shaw&quot; &lt;game-enthusiast@...&gt;","profile":"autonomousangela","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] rich lives for shy children","postDate":"1253143532","msgId":47265,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTgwMWNhMzcyNCRmYzYxMGVkMCRmNTIzMmM3MCRAY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGg4cm9rMCtubDI1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGg4cm9rMCtubDI1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47262,"nextInTopic":47266,"prevInTime":47264,"nextInTime":47266,"topicId":47262,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I had two kids who sound a lot like your son.

We did not do group<br/>\ngatherings for a long time because of it. (tried and stopped because it<br/>\nwasn&#39;t worth it to me)  If you would like to continue the group, I would<br/>\nsuggest inviting one of the children over for a play date at your house<br/>\nwhere he can get to know them on a one on one basis.  If he makes a good<br/>\nconnection with one or more of the kids on his own terms, he MAY be more<br/>\nlikely to enjoy going to the group to hang out with that one child.  My kids<br/>\nat ages 12 and 14 sometimes enjoy group gatherings now but only certain ones<br/>\nat that.  They are a lot like me in that way.  I&#39;d much rather visit with<br/>\n1-3 people at a time rather than a large group.  I&#39;m easily overwhelmed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that suggestion doesn&#39;t work, I personally wouldn&#39;t force him to go.  You<br/>\ncan instead invite the families over one at a time and enjoy their company<br/>\nthat way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":256043261,"authorName":"vespertine_nsw","from":"&quot;vespertine_nsw&quot; &lt;kezzdee@...&gt;","profile":"vespertine_nsw","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"rich lives for shy children","postDate":"1253139904","msgId":47262,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGg4cm9rMCtubDI1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":47265,"prevInTime":47261,"nextInTime":47263,"topicId":47262,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi again group.

This is the third discussion opened by me in a short time, I hope I am not bombarding everyone with too much too soon, I&#39;m just so passionate and full of questions right now!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a shy 4 year old son, Eli. Well, I don&#39;t know if shy is quite the word. He is extremely uncomfortable in crowds/groups of strangers and takes a long time to warm up to people, but he is NOT shy with people he knows well, such as family and close friends! In fact he is quite the entertainer, very chatty and funny!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn respect of his shyness with new folk, though, I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m doing the right thing by him here. We have a play-meet with a group of Mums and kids once a week, and I *really* enjoy it, as it&#39;s really the only time I have to connect with adult friends (we&#39;ve recently moved city so don&#39;t know anyone here.) But because the group is fairly new, Eli is anxious about going, and spends the morning as we&#39;re getting ready to go, saying things like &#39;&#39;I won&#39;t want to go, I just want to stay home with you!&#39;&#39; <br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to continue going to the group in hope he will warm up to the other children and have fun. And because I enjoy it too(when he isn&#39;t complaining that he wants to leave). But without knowing how long it will take, I&#39;m not sure whether to continue. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was also wondering, because the people in our lives are part of what makes life so rich and colurful, how do we help create rich lives for shy children? I&#39;m sure Eli would be happy if he never had to be introduced to a stranger again! Sometimes it almost seems he is physically in pain from his shyness so I don&#39;t feel inclined to take him to many social groups at all. But of course once he gets to know people, he adores them, and learns so much from them.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook forward to hearing your feedback,<br/>\nKerrie in Australia.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47260,"nextTopicId":47229}}
