That&#39;s my main thought about how to make unschooling simple and dynamic.  It keeps going if the parents keep providing a rich environment.   Sometimes that can be as simple as a puzzle being out on a table, or a toy being set up in a good place to play with it, when it hasn&#39;t been seen for a while.  Sometimes eating out of different dishes can be cause for conversation about what and why.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, strewing is about learning.  But learning can be helped or harmed by situations and moods, so yeah, Shira&#39;s right.   If a child is feeling kind of bored, confined, and uneasy, bringing something cool out to amuse or distract him might prevent him and the mom too from being irritated.  &quot;Like a magician...&quot; :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom &quot;Your House as a Museum&quot;:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Sometimes my kids get bored, and I can light up a half hour by digging into some box or drawer and producing something they&#39;ve never yet seen. Like a magician pulling a bouquet of flowers out of a wand, I pull out a little doll, or some Australian coins, electric curlers (for sorting, putting back on the rods, and discussing), muffin tins, poker chips, grandpa&#39;s bow ties, a hand-cranked egg beater to froth up soapy water (I wish I had a hand-cranked drill; my dad did). Whenever I pull these things out I tell the kids why I have them and what I know about them. I told about the gold strip in Australian paper money, about ties my dad used to have with cowboys and bucking broncos on them, about patterned muffin tins being pressed kind of like steel car parts are pressed, of getting my hair stuck in electric curlers when I was a teenager and crying because I was afraid my long hair would have to be cut off.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m always happy when my husband shows me something new he&#39;s found or made, or something old he had forgotten about.  Perhaps my easily-amusedness was passed on to my kids genetically, but when I have house guests they seem interested in playing with things I set out for them to find, too, or hearing the why and what about various objects around the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279647515,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"&quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;d.lewis@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Strewing","postDate":"1273852178","msgId":54126,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlCRjFENTU0MEI3NzRENkI5QzFCMjBDMzM0NDlCMjBFQGRlYm9yYWg0M2YxM2ZkPg==","referencesHeader":"PDREQjk0NEJELTkyNzctNDYwRC05NzYzLTYwMDREMzZERkNBQUBTYW5kcmFEb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":54106,"nextInTopic":59217,"prevInTime":54125,"nextInTime":54127,"topicId":54106,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"*** Strewing ...I ve seen this term bandied about a lot lately, and it s just a new name for the concept of facilitating your child s interests.
