Years ago, when I was younger and single, I went to a marriage workshop. The only thing I have ever remembered from it is that, people receive and give love differently and when you care or because you care, you should go with their flow and give them the love the way the need it. I am a person who likes to hear it. Giving me things doesn&#39;t make me believe I&#39;m loved. When I got married I used this and when I started having children also. I have 3 children and they all have different ways that I had to adjust to show them love in a way they would know that I care. Some physical, some verbal, some material. I have to be careful with my youngest because he is an artist an daily, several times a day brings me pictures he&#39;s done. Right now he draws a lot of Marvel characters. I have on a occasion said, &quot;That&#39;s nice Jalen&quot; and not been specific. He is very verbal and likes me to<br/>\n be specifically verbal with him. I&#39;ve adjusted me to fit him even though I&#39;m more comfortable expressing love physically and materially. <br/>\nHis reaction when I give him what he needs is completely different than when I&#39;m casual about what he&#39;s excited about...<br/>\nLesa~ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: New, Intro & Question","postDate":"1336735618","msgId":67112,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpvaXQyMit2MGhwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGpvN21rbStqM24yQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":67097,"nextInTopic":67114,"prevInTime":67111,"nextInTime":67113,"topicId":67085,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... **************** Lots of people like routines, calendars, instructions, and feedback - including kids, but that doesn t mean they aren t compatible with","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1391689594\">&quot;annehomeschooling@...&quot; &lt;annehomeschooling@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m a laid-back, no calendar, go-with-the-flow person (as are dh and ds).

My 10yo daughter is like that. It might help you to consider that your daughter&#39;s &quot;flow&quot; is more regular than yours - when you go with Your flow it throws hers out of kilter. To support her, you&#39;ll need to adapt to her need for regularity. Otherwise, you&#39;re trying to fit her into a mold just as surely as if she was in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she likes a calendar, be sure she has one - maybe a regular one and one of those page-a-day calendars, those can be a lot of fun for a kid who likes to mark the day. Check the calender with her every day. Check the weather, perhaps, if she likes that. Or if you have a page-a-day calender, read or do the daily project with her at some regular time, like right after breakfast. Make solid plans to do things with her and write them down. If you&#39;re wishy-washy about plans, to her it probably seems like you don&#39;t care. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf she likes instructions, do things with her that use instructions. Get how-to books and kits. My daughter loves how-to books and kits. For years, although she read early, she was only interested in reading instructions not stories. Even now, nothing satisfies her like a good manual. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf she likes feedback, give her what she wants. If she&#39;s asking &quot;is this right/good?&quot; and you&#39;re saying something like &quot;whatever you do is wonderful&quot; that may, again, feel like you don&#39;t really care. Give her Solid feedback. If she draws something and asks if it&#39;s good, you can comment on perspective or proportion or color balance - give her Information she can use to make choices. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso consider the fact that some people like praise. That&#39;s often thought of as a character flaw or a sign on emotional damage, but it can be an aspect of personality. Some people feel more cared for when others say good things about them. It may be your daughter needs some affirming words to know you love her. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] New, Intro & Question","postDate":"1336410854","msgId":67097,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFDMkZFNzg0LTRBQjEtNDhFMS04NjRDLUIzQTc5M0IzNTUyMEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMzY0MTAwMDYuNDA3NDQuWWFob29NYWlsUkNAd2ViMTg0NDE1Lm1haWwuYmYxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGpvN21rbStqM24yQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MkVDMjRFNTktNTM1OC00NEMzLUI2OEMtMUMwMkJFQjU0NDMzQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8MTMzNjM4MzMzMC44NjQyMC5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViMTQwMjE1Lm1haWwuYmYxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPEExNDg1RkI0LTNCMUQtNEQ1Ri1CNjgyLTk5OEE1QUY3MEI5QkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDEzMzY0MDM2NzMuNzc1MjguWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTAzLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDEzMzY0MTAwMDYuNDA3NDQuWWFob29NYWlsUkNAd2ViMTg0NDE1Lm1haWwuYmYxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":67096,"nextInTopic":67112,"prevInTime":67096,"nextInTime":67098,"topicId":67085,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I am a *huge* book lover, my girls not so much. -=- I was too, my kids not as much.

Our family consists of Me, dh, ds (6), dd (10). We&#39;ve been homeschooling for almost 5yrs. I started looking into unschooling nearly 2yrs ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the past year, I&#39;ve been trying to ease my dd into it and it just doesn&#39;t seem to work for her--AT ALL, really, not at all. For ds, he&#39;s thrived. It&#39;s obvious by a conversation with him, that he has great thinking skills. He&#39;s just great academically and I have no worries at all (about him). He does have a couple &quot;rules&quot; for school but that is to listen when I read, for example. Everyone is impressed by him, especially since he can read very well and has never taught--you know, things like this.<br/>\n<br/>\nDD on the other hand, seems to not even like the idea of unschooling. I&#39;m a laid-back, no calendar, go-with-the-flow person (as are dh and ds). She just seems to be a VERY STRUCTURED, needs a calendar, needs instructions, needs reviews, tests, grades, feedback. Is it possible that unschooling just won&#39;t work with certain personality types?  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nAnne</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67109,"nextTopicId":67119}}
