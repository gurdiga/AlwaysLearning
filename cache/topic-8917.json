They hit a bump and he went <br/>\nflying out of the truck.  He hit wrong and his entire right arm/hand was <br/>\nparalyzed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents rode in vehicles without seat belts.  As I child I wasn&#39;t in <br/>\na car seat but my parents did install seat belts and as toddlers we were <br/>\nin harnesses.  Both my parents and I are just fine, so does that mean I <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t keep my kids in seat belts, or in car/booster seats? Of course <br/>\nnot.  The risk, however slight, is decreased by my children being <br/>\nbuckled in safely.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t believe in sitting on a couch not living life for fear that we <br/>\nwill be injured.  But I do believe in reducing that risk by not <br/>\npracticing risky behavior, wearing seat belts, not riding unbelted, not <br/>\nriding in the back of a truck, making sure the restraint system on a <br/>\nrollercoaster fits correctly, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also don&#39;t see the desire to ride in the back of the truck being more <br/>\nimportant than the risk of doing so.  It&#39;s all about balancing risk vs <br/>\nbenefits.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo sorry, but Iwould never allow my children to ride in the back of a <br/>\ntruck.<br/>\n<br/>\njoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie Stauffer wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;&lt;Yikes.
