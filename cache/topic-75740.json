Alexandria, who just turned eighteen, wants to enroll in beauty school to become a nail technician. Last year, she got a paid internship writing content for a nail site, earned enough cash to pay her tuition outright (not that we won&#39;t help - but it really impressed me that when our finances were looking shaky after Hubby&#39;s head on collision with the drunk driver last year she found a way to make her goals happen), has done a ton of research on different schools, state requirements, and everything else.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>They won&#39;t let her enroll without a GED because, even though the state doesn&#39;t require it for her license, they want to be able to check a box for the institution that oversees their status as accredited. They haven&#39;t had a homeschooler before and I think they just picked the option that&#39;s easiest for them.&nbsp;<br><br>She could join the military, could enroll in an ivy league college...but she can&#39;t enroll in beauty school?&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>It would all be fine, but the GED changed last year, ten states (not ours) have already dropped it, and after reading about all of the controversy with the new text, &nbsp;Alex is ready to tear he hair out over the whole thing. &lt;http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/13/ivy-league-grads-can-t-pass-the-new-ged.html&gt;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Has anyone had success convincing a trade school to accept transcripts? &nbsp;Any ideas for us?&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Michelle&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75735,"nextTopicId":75745}}
