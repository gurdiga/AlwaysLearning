Great fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a different topic, I was channel surfing and landed on a show on the History Channel <br/>\nthat just didn&#39;t sound that interesting to me at first.  It was ancient military technology.  It <br/>\nwas fascinating, and mostly centered around Asia.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs it turns out, whole wars were lost, sometimes, out at sea before even landing due to <br/>\nbad timing and/or the wrong equipment.  If fact, Japan was the last hold-out to Ghengis <br/>\nKhan and had become a thorn in his side with all the pirating--that&#39;s a different pirate <br/>\nimage, huh?  He sent everything he had--perhaps 10,000 ships.  Meanwhile, the Japanese <br/>\nprayed for deliverance.  It came in the form of a storm that sank almost everything as the <br/>\nMongolians reached the Japanese coast--a &quot;wind of God&quot; that they called &quot;Kamikaze.&quot;  <br/>\nDirect connection to modern times.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, in school, I didn&#39;t learn anything about the whole range and scope of Ghengis Khan-<br/>\n-just that he was a barbarian conqueror.  I&#39;m thinking he was a little more than that.  He <br/>\nhad a territory that was something like 3 times the size of the United States at one time, if <br/>\nthe history channel was right.  I think that was important to a lot of people!<br/>\n<br/>\nI just don&#39;t get why they have to sacrifice wonderful stories for the dry memorization of <br/>\ndates and names.  It makes the conspiracy theories pretty believable.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny C","from":"&quot;Jenny C&quot; &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Tab (was Re: History)","postDate":"1224447749","msgId":39563,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdkZzR1NSsydDAxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdkZmNuZitjODAwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39562,"nextInTopic":39572,"prevInTime":39562,"nextInTime":39564,"topicId":39540,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I&#39;m sure there were other resources<br/>\nout there, but it was fun to kind of go to the source of actual<br/>\nhistorical documentation rather than take someone&#39;s word for it, even if<br/>\nthey were an expert.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Our kids all are forming their own historical trails/tunnels/<br/>\n&gt; histories with what they know about toys, video games, computers,<br/>\n&gt; popular music, and movies.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is exactly why my husband doesn&#39;t like to get rid of stuff!  Our<br/>\nhouse has a lot of weird items tucked away.  We like to browse thrift<br/>\nstores and antique stores just to find unusual things of the not so<br/>\ndistant past.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Our kids are living history right now, being part of the first really<br/>\n&gt; big batch of unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>One thing I started to think about, after this conversation was this<br/>\nidea of failing or not failing a history class.  Chamille has a friend<br/>\nwho isn&#39;t doing so well in her history class.  The idea of it seems so<br/>\nabsurd to me.  I mean, if we had the ability of time travel maybe we&#39;d<br/>\nall be experts in history.  The idea that someone could fail &quot;history&quot;<br/>\nis such a weird thing to consider.  I know in reality she probably got<br/>\ndates wrong, but for someone like her, or others that don&#39;t do numbers<br/>\nwell, that&#39;s a really bad way to look at history.  Even for people who<br/>\ndo like numbers, history isn&#39;t about that.  To me, it&#39;s more about the<br/>\nevolution of ideas and how they are physically portrayed.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we have are other people&#39;s documentation of things of the past,<br/>\nbooks, music, pictures, objects, etc.  These things are all around us,<br/>\nand things of the 20th century will be around for many many years still.<br/>\nSomething that used to really bother me in school was how history seemed<br/>\nto be documented by dates of wars. conquering of lands, and famous male<br/>\nfigures, things I really don&#39;t have a lot of interest in, it&#39;s only<br/>\nnotable peripherally.  I was more interested in what people actually did<br/>\non a day to day basis in various points in time and I wanted to know not<br/>\nonly what people from the US or England did, but what people from Japan<br/>\nor India did.  I had to wait until college to learn some of that stuff. <br/>\nMy kids can learn these things any time they want to, whenever it<br/>\ninterests them.  That&#39;s really exciting to me!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: History","postDate":"1224339570","msgId":39545,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZEQjExOTM3LTBFODUtNEQ0RS05NEM5LUYwNkYxREU5MkM3N0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdkYnA0citrbGxxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdkYnA0citrbGxxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39543,"nextInTopic":39549,"prevInTime":39544,"nextInTime":39546,"topicId":39540,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I am blown away by that letter.

It was a museum mystery  <br/>\ngame.  One of the paintings we needed clues from was some guys on a  <br/>\nboat, and we were supposed to identify the period of the painting.  I  <br/>\nknew by the hats and costumes.  Unfortunately, somehow the &quot;real  <br/>\nanswer&quot; was to know it by the boat rigging.  And it was no big boat,  <br/>\neither, but a little kind of six passenger slightly-bigger-than- <br/>\nrowboat, with one sail.   Well hell, I don&#39;t have to know about that  <br/>\nto identify periods.
