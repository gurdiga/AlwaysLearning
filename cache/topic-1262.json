I<br/>\ncould see that the way I&#39;d been was creating an unnecessary amount of<br/>\nconflict and I&#39;ve learned a lot from people here.  But sometimes I get<br/>\nconfused about what my rights are and I tend to think in black and white<br/>\nand get lost in the gray areas.  I&#39;m questioning myself and how I want<br/>\nto be a lot these days.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I thought I&#39;d throw this out.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just bought a new truck that doesn&#39;t have air bags so it is possible<br/>\nfor the first time in years for dd to sit in the front seat.  When there<br/>\nwere only two of us in the truck, no problem, she sat in the front seat<br/>\nand thrilled in her position.  Because dh does most, if not all of the<br/>\ndriving (for which I&#39;m grateful), this morning she said to me, &quot;You&#39;re<br/>\ngoing to have to get used to sitting in the back seat because I&#39;m going<br/>\nto want to sit in the front seat.&quot;  My response was, &quot;Let&#39;s talk about<br/>\nit later&quot; because I don&#39;t know what I want to say or do.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently, we got into a struggle over my favorite seat in the living<br/>\nroom.  I thought it through and decided to start sitting somewhere<br/>\nelse.  Soon she wanted my new seat so I took back my old seat.  I know<br/>\nit&#39;s not only about the seat.  I think it&#39;s also about being treated<br/>\nfairly and as an equal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose this might happen with the truck seating too but the problem<br/>\nis I really don&#39;t want to sit in the back seat and  I&#39;m having a bit of<br/>\na temper tantrum over it.  We&#39;re going to take a year long trip in this<br/>\ntruck and I&#39;d really rather not do it from the back seat.  I just can&#39;t<br/>\nthink of a valid reason why I should always get to sit in the front seat<br/>\nor even most of the time.  Why shouldn&#39;t it be equal if she wants it<br/>\nequal?  Occasionally in the car, I used to join her in the back seat<br/>\nbecause she didn&#39;t want to be alone (only child).  But if I have to<br/>\nchoose between driving and sitting in the back seat half of the time,<br/>\nugh.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this isn&#39;t an earth shattering issue but I hope to be<br/>\nenlightened.  Do you let your kids sit in the front seat when they want<br/>\nto even if it means you have to sit in the back seat?
