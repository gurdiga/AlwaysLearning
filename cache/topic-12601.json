I have thought of you almost <br/>\ndaily, but didn&#39;t know for sure if you could handle a bunch of email or not.<br/>\nI figured I&#39;d wait until you made your way back to the list and then write.<br/>\nI&#39;ve cried for you, for your sweet Sam and thanked God that you spent your <br/>\nlives together the way you did.<br/>\nI have looked at my children over and over while thinking of Sam and reminded <br/>\nmyself how very , very thankful I am to not only spend the time I get with <br/>\nthem, but to have found unschooling and be able to live our lives in freedom.<br/>\nNot wasting time with petty things like school.....life is too short.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know that I&#39;ll live to see them grow up, I don&#39;t have the guarantee <br/>\nthat they will make it to adulthood.<br/>\nBut I have right now. I have today and I can spend it as joyfully and <br/>\npassionately as possible.  I&#39;m glad you did.<br/>\nI&#39;m glad Sam had such a wise Mama. And I am so sad still too......I just ache <br/>\nfor anyone losing loved ones because it is such a huge hole in your life. But <br/>\nespecially for Moms that lose their babies, or babies that lose their Moms, <br/>\nit&#39;s almost too much to comprehend. <br/>\nWe&#39;re still here, and I&#39;m glad to see you here too.......<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>\ngrowing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>\nmagic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>\nme....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n                                    ----Frances Hodgson Burnett</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12598,"nextTopicId":12461}}
