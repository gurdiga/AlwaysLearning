But most families have lots of words flowing.  What school calls “reading readiness” is probably present in abundance in your children!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter was eleven when she learned to read in just a few weeks, from halting sounding out words to reading Stephen King without hesitation (silently or aloud).  That happened because her vocabulary was large, her knowledge levels were high in other areas.  She read “The Body,” a novella on which the movie “Stand By Me” was based, and she ‘bout had that movie memorized, as it had been her favorite since she was three years old or so.  Few people would have thought that dozens of repeated viewings of a movie about pre-pubescent boys would be reading prep for a little girl, but we never, ever know how our kids are putting the world all together in their heads until we look back and evidence!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many things to read that were linked in a post from me yesterday, about later reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":345198821,"authorName":"Kari","from":"Kari &lt;parkerkarijo@...&gt;","profile":"jrwhale","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Materials, Tips, Software, Advice on Helping an Older Child Learn to Read","postDate":"1453334906","msgId":76559,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1MjYxODJjN2FiLTgxNi0yM2IzQHdlYnByZC1hODYubWFpbC5hb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":76560,"prevInTime":76558,"nextInTime":76560,"topicId":76559,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, My 12 year old really wants to learn how to read, and it is not something that is happening naturally for him....
