I&#39;ve talked with lots of homeschoolers, school <br/>\nofficials in two counties, and a couple of teachers.  The only way <br/>\nI&#39;ve found to do part-time school is to have a special IEP which is a <br/>\nspecial plan written for special education students.  Even then, the <br/>\nspecial ed teacher who told me about it said the school officials <br/>\nwould never tell me about it or offer it.  Instead, I&#39;d be better off <br/>\nhiring an attorney to send letters to make sure the IEP was not only <br/>\nwritten, but followed.  Oh, and this woman&#39;s advice was her way of <br/>\ngetting my son into school where she believes he&#39;d be more successful <br/>\nin life.  I&#39;m thinking if I have to go through all that for what the <br/>\nschools to consider to be special ed, they aren&#39;t likely going to <br/>\nwork nicely with me for a non-special ed student.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I am willing to try talking with the principal again.  She <br/>\nknows me from our previous time there.  I will call tuesday morning <br/>\nto see if I can speak with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I also talked with a Montessori school last year.  I asked if I <br/>\ncould pay full tuition and have my daughter attend only part of the <br/>\nday and they said it wasn&#39;t possible.  I was surprised because they <br/>\nwere a private school.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I know I have organized some field trips and plays this upcoming<br/>\n&gt; year and Lydia still wants to go.

Lydia wanted to go for<br/>\nsocial reasons and Graham wanted to also.  I have them in two different<br/>\nschool districts because Lydia wanted to go to our neighborhood school<br/>\nand Graham joined a lego league through a montessori school so wanted to<br/>\ngo there. ( I had them on the waiting list since Kindergarton at this<br/>\nMontessori school in case they ever decided to go)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure where you live so I&#39;m not sure what the laws are.  Here in<br/>\nIowa they offer dual enrollment.  Graham is doing that.  He goes to<br/>\nschool for PE, art, music, lunch and recess.  The school is NOT<br/>\nresponsible for assessing him so they really don&#39;t care if he&#39;s there or<br/>\nnot!  Come when he wants, leave when he wants!  If he doesn&#39;t feel like<br/>\ngoing (which one day this first week he didn&#39;t) I just shoot his teacher<br/>\nan email.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had hoped Lydia would do the same (dual enrollment) but she wanted to<br/>\ntry the whole deal.  She had a bike accident right before school started<br/>\nand we&#39;ve been to quite a few dentist appointments and doctors<br/>\nappointments.  I asked Lydia if she wanted to go during the day or after<br/>\nschool.  She prefers to go during the day so I have her leave.  Needless<br/>\nto say, I am already getting looks and they are making things more<br/>\ndifficult than they have to.  Personally, I don&#39;t mind, it just<br/>\nreinforces to Lydia the negatives of school life.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, my point is different districts may have different tolerance<br/>\nlevels.  Different types of schools (montessori, private, charter) have<br/>\ndifferent philosophies so I would do your research. Also find out your<br/>\nstates homeschool laws and find out your options!<br/>\n<br/>\nLydia was asking me how much school she could miss and if she could show<br/>\nup late.  I told her, that if it got to the point that she wasn&#39;t really<br/>\nwanting to go or be there that she would either have to switch to dual<br/>\nenrollment or go back to homeschool/unschool because at some point I<br/>\nwill be held legally liable.  I&#39;ll let it go as far as I can for her. <br/>\nShe is informed and sets her alarm and gets up before everyone else in<br/>\nthe house.  I usually hear her so then get up and see her off.  If she<br/>\nneeded my help getting up and getting to bed I would help her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t want to become the mom who forces bedtimes and wake times but<br/>\n&gt; I feel responsible for her getting up, even though she&#39;s the one who<br/>\n&gt; has decided to go to school.  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Talk to her ahead of time.  Talk about the realities.  See if she can<br/>\njust go in the afternoons??<br/>\n<br/>\nLydia asked me if she would have a bedtime when school started!  I said<br/>\nwith a smile, do you want a bedtime?   She shrugged like she thought<br/>\nthat would go with it.  I told her I function best with 8 hours of sleep<br/>\nand someone your age probably functions best with 10.  But try it out<br/>\nyourself.  So, she is.  She&#39;s gone to bed a different times and some<br/>\ndays she&#39;s been dragging more than others.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do know friends in the public school system who travel a lot and miss<br/>\nway more than the amount of time they&#39;re &quot;allowed&quot; to miss.  So, I&#39;m<br/>\nsure if you talk to the school and have a reason to be gone, they MAY be<br/>\nmore understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I have organized some field trips and plays this upcoming year<br/>\nand Lydia still wants to go.  So, we&#39;ll have to see how the school<br/>\nreacts.
