Accidentally turning up porn sites is <br/>\nrare in my experience- the last time I can remember it happening was <br/>\na good while ago when I was helping my son view various tattoos and <br/>\npiercings.  Even then it wasn&#39;t &quot;half the sites.&quot; <br/>\n*************************<br/>\n  We tried putting on parent filters once because my son got a few surprise sites when he googled &#39;wild west&#39;.  He was going through a cowboy phase and I think Will Smith had a movie out that he liked.  So several porn sites come up, we try the parent filters.  They made us crazy!  After that my kids couldn&#39;t get into so many cool sites that they frequent. I was astonished at some of the crazy stuff it filters.  I felt like it was keeping them from much more joy and learning. We took off the filter in less than a day and just explained to the kids about porn being on the net and that if they were at all concerned we would help them with searches.  My two youngest want help searching, or rather they like Mom&#39;s company while they google.:0)<br/>\n  My teen girls sometimes laugh at the title of sights that come up, but can tell from that which ones to open or skip.  <br/>\n  Ann<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBlab-away for as little as 1Â¢/min.
