It was a &quot;reprint&quot; of a Connections article.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://familyrun.ning.com/profiles/blogs/2184370:BlogPost:21737\">http://familyrun.ning.com/profiles/blogs/2184370:BlogPost:21737</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSince writing that Jayn (9) has been moving towards reading exactly as predicted. The other night she sat beside me reading aloud to me. She read a few paragraphs from an American Girl doll hair styling tips book. Many words she recognized. Some others she tried out a couple of options based on some of the letters that seemed right in context, glancing at me for confirmation. Others she asked me straight out &quot;what&#39;s that&quot; repeating the word after I said it. Every now and then she seemed to be sounding a word out. Some of her &quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot; recognition was switched around, but it didn&#39;t matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a couple of paragraphs of what was evidently very intensive brain work, she paused, saying &quot;phew&quot; and then talked about how excited and proud of herself she was to be half way reading. She was full of joyful giggles. Then she suddenly announced that it was so exciting that she wanted to read some more, so she opened the book to her bookmark and continued for several more sentences. The words she read to me included a hyphenated word (broken for space in the typesetting), which led to a brief explanation and moment (only a moment) of confusion. <br/>\n<br/>\nI love that the item she chose to read aloud for the first time, other than the names of tv shows on the program guide, was a &quot;how to&quot; book about something to do with dolls. I love that the vocabulary is real life vocabulary of many different word lengths - important information for Jayn in her life. I love that it is totally in her own time. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m so grateful that I have spent enough time learning about unschooling that I didn&#39;t say &quot;sound it out&quot; to Jayn even once in her whole life.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling really does work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
